have a whole video for you and I feel
like it's quite a special haul because I
haven't done a horn in basically about
three to four months which in YouTube
terms is actually quite a long time and
I actually started my channel doing
whole videos if you didn't know so I
said it's a Primark I makes the good to
vintage shops and I can buy stuff like
every two weeks I would have a video on
this channel it was actually crazy how
much I had on here kind of got to this
place of realizing I'm kind of just
buying stuff to do videos and I'm not
actually wearing this stuff or actually
really liking them self and my closets
were just bulging with stuff I just
didn't one and then also I wasn't
feeling very comfortable with my body
you know it happens to any girl you're
just like I don't really like the way I
look right now like my middle region was
has just been giving me struggle it's
getting a lot better I'd lost a bit of
weight and I'm starting to feel a bit
more comfortable in my skin
and yeah I just thought like I didn't
actually know what my personal style was
I like to be of everything if it was
cheaper for us but you know I don't want
to do that anymore I want to really feel
excited when I buy items of clothing and
know why I'm buying it so what am i
wearing it for where are we going
my college is bright clothes never go
anywhere to wear it - were you wearing
that - and I kind of define my style now
which I hadn't done before so here is
the definition of my style it's
basically a pea casual with a girly edge
and then with a bit of bougie thought
right with that boogy thought and then a
little bit of boots sprinkled in the
middle so yeah that's basically it so
I'm gonna get started here's my whole
you can even see I've got my birthday
dress which I'm gonna show as well at
some point in time so yeah hope you guys
enjoy so I've gone back to an old
favorite Chop Shop
crazy right alright so first things
first is the denim killer
and I bought two pair of jeans this pair
of jeans is the mom jeans and this style
is the vintage style and I've been
feeling like I'm just kind of moving
away from the skinny skinny jean which I
still love I like an everyday basis but
mom jeans are slightly more flattering
and they are really trendy and these I
find are a hardly denim so I feel that
they will last longer I love to wear
something like this like a casual
t-shirt I also bought this pair I think
now called the Orson there are high
waist kind of straight skinny leg jeans
again they're really really flattering
and I feel it's so hard to find the
perfect pair of jeans but these are
really nice they're slightly cropped at
the end core but I quite like that cuz I
think it looks really nice in boots and
yeah and then also bought this little
skirt and I love the kind of multi denim
effect and I actually got rid of all my
stuff I was so uncomfortable wearing
skirts and I don't know why I got so
uncomfortable wearing them but it's nice
to have a nice denim skirt back in the
collection hey so after that this set is
here this is where you go this is the
casual this is the casual but it's also
very stylish it's very sports love which
is very trendy and it's just this kind
of I don't know if you call it a sweat
jumper I love it I love red I realized
red is a color that I find very
flattering this has got red and white
paneling detail very very nice and love
it I wear this with denim looks fabulous
love it but then it also has the
matching pants
check these out how fabulous are these
let look at the detailing and I love the
idea of wearing it matching it's kind of
very 1830 90s and the whole tracksuit
thing is really on trend and I'm here
for it because I like to have my casual
days okay this was something slightly
different for me but I just really love
all the colors and then I think I
avoided color for so so so long I'm just
like I kind of went crazy with they're
like kind of neon orange and the green
and the
Mustard's ping it's got everything on
there but I think it still looks really
elegant and really flattering I'm good
I'm late I really like this top because
I just bought a t-shirt and I thought
this is really nice I do like things
that have got like a v-neck sometimes I
feel like t-shirts don't suit me but
this is a v-neck it's kind of cut out
here but then it also has the detail
around the neck which I liked again this
is part of my life I just need some new
spring casual items that suit me and
this is definitely up my street now this
is really really different for me
like super different but I think it's
just you it's just adorable and like
check out the back some days it's really
nice to have that piece in your closet
that just scans out you put it on and
you look like you're put together this
is that here okay so next up I have this
yellow jacket here and it's kind of more
like a yellowy mustard I love it one
because I am always in black and I can
always bled back on my black know I've
got like loads of black like jackets I
don't have a bright yellow jacket and I
thought this was really nice as a spring
transitional piece it's like a long line
so it's one of those things that you can
wear something slightly photic on the
bottom so like you know a little leather
skirt little mess t-shirt but then you
have this to be elegant on the top I
think it's really nice it's really buggy
it looks expensive and it's actually
quite warm so it's a really nice
transitional piece so this top here I
mean there isn't very much top with
going on but this top here is me in the
top and I saw it and it was like they'd
run out of it in like normal scientists
but I found it in tall and I was able to
buy it in a size 10 which is really good
and one I love mesh like a nut mesh
overlay is something I've always liked
and then I love what it says they all no
fear for me that is just such a bold
statement that I'm just like I'm so here
for it okay so
I got some footwear the whole ballet um
it's very very on trend right now but an
invite for trend I realized that for me
trying to find shoes that make my feet
not look as long as they are is an
ultimate forever struggle it always has
been I feel like it always will be
but these are really really nice I could
only get the red pair I really want the
black pen when I'm really trying buy
them anyway they're very flattering and
they're extremely comfortable for me the
level of comfort is worth the fact that
the shoe isn't the prettiest and then I
also bought these mules I really love
love love these viewers love these mules
I feel like they're an everyday meal
Michael detest them he thinks that
they're very ugly shoes I feel like
they're shoes that men like and that
they're shoes that women like these are
definitely a woman my king shoe
this everything everything darling then
I also got this burgundy wrapper jumper
is slightly cropped I love the detailing
here and it's still kind of polar next
season so yeah this is one that can be
worn again with some jeans let me show
you the one item I bought quite a few
items from riverlite Island online but
this is the only one I ended up keeping
my style I've noticed that I love
off-the-shoulder
I feel like every time I gravitate to
clothing I gravitate to clothing that is
off the shoulder I've accepted it it's
my thing so this is really nice off the
shoulder and also gingham is really in
trend but this is it I really like it is
off the shoulder it's cropped and it's
also you know okay so next I'm going to
show you two very pricey items I didn't
just buy them I actually bought the bag
about two or three months ago and then
the jacket is a recent purchase around
my birthday I had some birthday money
and I was I'm gonna get myself something
special so firstly it is my my Louboutin
and backpack I have been wanting a
backpack for the longest I could design
a backpack and I tried out a few and
this one here was my favorite every guys
my favorite I hate stuff that is really
really garish and I know Louboutin
having like the mininum of all of the
like just loads of lure you want over it
and it's just not me it's just not how I
wear designer items but then I saw this
backpack and I was like oh my gosh it's
just so demure and just fabulous
I just was like I love this bag and so
so far it's been worn so many times but
there's stuff inside it now if I
actually use it a lot and for me I love
when a designer bag if it's gonna get
wet and I'm not gonna 90% of my designer
bags have where and if I'm not wearing
them I'm selling them I'll be sending
them on my Deepak down below actually so
the next purchase was this this is my
Balmain blazer oh my gosh
Balmain blazer yes so this was a
birthday present for me and I just loved
it and I actually wanted a bomb on
brazier from like last season and I
wasn't able to get one up and then this
is the new spring collection listen as
soon as I saw it as I clicked it by
because once these are gone they are
fully gone you can never get these back
so I love it it's structured piece makes
you look very expensive as soon as you
put it on you can put on like a black
top and skinny jeans put this on listen
you're ready for business I love it my
final pieces are from ASOS
so actually this is way smaller than how
I used to do holes I just have so many
items in my room we're being mad crazy
but actually it's actually quite refined
quite proud of that so I bought some
basics from ASOS and it's basically this
top I bought it in the gray and I bought
it in the white as well what I really
like they are off the shoulder with long
sleeves and they're just really casual
basics I really hope they last they're
like 16 pounds so they're not exactly
like 4 pounds so you can use buy new
ones but I hope that they are so far
they look really good and then I also
got this pink
it's just it's just a basic t-shirt but
with the right denim which I've been
picking up really nice then it just
looks really nice really spring really
fresh and it's just a casual sheet that
I can wear everyday another thing I
realize has always been a part of my
collection has always been mesh look at
this this is my Buddha chic booth oh she
knew she loved it
look at the sleeves on that if this
isn't a festival amazing piece I don't
know what is again a broad layer or
something underneath and this is just
love it we love it
finally I picked up this yellow hoodie
why I don't know yellow is a color that
is really on trend hoodies are on trend
and I really like yellow on me and I'm
like cookies and I thought it was just a
cute piece this is one of the pieces you
like why did I pick out but I'm like you
know what I kind of like it I don't know
what do you guys think so actually I
just added this to show you guys it's
actually my birthday dress and so many
people asked about my birthday dress and
I thought it would be nice to share it
with you
I did buy my birthday dress myself and
in case anyone was wondering but it's a
brand called Giovanni who I never knew
about but I was in the Harvard's and I
knew that I wanted something quite fancy
and I was looking for you like all the
fancy girls I found this dress and it
just reminded me of something from
Strictly Come Dancing it's like oh my
god I love this and I love the tassels
and everything which made it look very
Casino Royale and it's just a gorgeous
piece it's gonna be my closet I don't
know how many times I'm gonna get to
wear it probably only once or twice more
but it's kind of a piece that I have
quite dear to my heart
I might actually sell it at some point
in time I don't know we'll see but lots
of people who are asking about it and so
here is the dress that you can see what
it looks like hey guys so that is the
end of my whole video I hope you guys
invited
I was gonna say if you wanna see any
more holes and let me know but you know
what this is not how we roll in this
town anymore I'll be doing hornless when
I'm inspired and see some clothing that
I genuinely like but now I feel like I'm
genuinely spring ready I love it and I'm
not scared of online shopping anymore

look at a sauce because it was stressing
me out okay guys so that's it and I will
see you later bye at the dress darling
