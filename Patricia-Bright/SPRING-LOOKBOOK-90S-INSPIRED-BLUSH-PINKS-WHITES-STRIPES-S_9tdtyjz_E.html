and I'm sharing some of my favorite
outfit over the past few weeks and I
think is a perfect for this time of year
so this first look is color blocking and
I've got this poncho which is from River
Island I love the kind of soft blues and
the Browns and I just want a simple
shirt and my leather trousers underneath
to kind of put the look together
recently I've definitely been loving
being a girly girl and I've got this
pink jumper which is from Topshop and my
part of bad which is actually it more
than me but looks pink in this look but
I really like kind of the blush look
it's really girly and feminine
there's a hair change joke of a long
weave my next look here is one of my
favorite looks for like this spring
going onto summer season I love a simple
button-down shirt especially in the kind
of stripe along with some white ripped
jeans and my dears are from Topshop and
my shirt is from Zara
I always say in the UK that we basically
have fake Sun and there's days where you
go out and it's actually kind of cold
and I think when light nips are really
really good this time of year I've got
this code set which is actually on sale
from River Island and it's perfect from
the days when the weather isn't quite
sure what it actually wants to do I'm a
big fan of kind of at 90s inspired look
I've got my bomber which is from Ivy
Park along with like my chains and
chokers and just a really simple look
these ripped jeans here and some added s
trainers pull everything together
this look here I'll absolutely love
going for statement pieces when I'm
wearing a simple outfit I've got these
gorgeous jewelry from carat London
who've been lovely enough to give me a
discount code for my subscribers but
when I'm going to keep it look simple I
like to add pops um with my accessories
my jacket it's on both of skins and my
trainers are from Abbey - and I just
love you know a simple all-black outfit
it makes you feel very comfortable
at the end of my lookbook I hope to
enjoyed that and if you want to see more

feeling more confident in your body and
I know how hard it is for so many of us
to feel genuinely body confident
