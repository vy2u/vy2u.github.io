have got a new in which is kind of like
a whole but not a whole because I've
decided I don't really want to do
massive halls anymore like stuff that I
didn't really want all night and what
I've done is I basically bought seasonal
things but I'm going to wear over the
next few months and mix-and-match of
things I've already got in my closet
things I'm really liking from the stores
right now I've got some fashion bits and
I've got some beauty as well and it just
feels really nice to come in treat
myself a little bit but listen I feel
like it's been a really long time it's
been about three three months eight
which to me is quite a long time to not
you know get anything maybe I just need
to help a little bit but yeah I've got
some great bits here that I want to
share with you so as I always say get
comfortable and get a cup of tea I'm
drinking chamomile and honey you can
drink whatever you like so the first
thing I obviously wanted to share with
you is my new Prada bag and this was a
gift from my hubby for me kind of like a
push present gift and and this is the
new season Prada and I've got it in the
nude but and potentially thinking about
exchanging it for gray so I'd love to
hear what your thoughts are but I really
do love the bag I got the shape and if
you guys know me my first designer bag
that I ever bought was a Prada bag and I
still wear it four and a half years
later at least once or twice a week so I
find them to be really good investments
and luck than ever they really soft
they're really nice and they're just
really elegant usually when I go for a
designer bag I try to steer away from
the really trendy trendy bag and I like
to go for a classic piece that I know
that I really like and I loved the color
for spring I thought was a really good
choice after that for some reason I've
gone wild on Topshop I found that
Topshop has really kind of got pieces
that kind of a suit in me and I don't
know I've gotten back to really liking
them so I've got quite a few bits in
them I did pick up some items from Ivy
Park and that's a new collection with
Beyonce the only thing is that it is
activewear and I thought to myself me
spending loads and activewear
isn't gonna make sense because I wear
basically old house clothes and
Michael's clothes to the gym versa
is actual you know really nice pieces
and I wouldn't really want to spend the
moment but so what I ended up picking up
were the bomber jackets from Ivy Park
and I thought that one these are just
really nice outerwear and you guys know
I invest loads in my outerwear and I
bought the black and the white because I
just thought that they were really nice
pieces
I like bombers all year round so I
thought that these are pieces that could
definitely be in my wardrobe for a long
term and aren't just trendy pieces after
that I picked up two new pair of jeans
from Topshop and to be honest I've
always loved Topshop jeans I'm a big
Jamie Jean wearer and what I bought were
a white pair of jeans because my old
white pair of jeans were just tatty and
they're virtually grey so I replaced an
old pair and then I bought a spring
coloured pair which is kind of this pink
pair of jeans that I've got here and the
white jeans are a distressed pair of
white jeans that I thought were really
nice and my old white jeans weren't
distressed but they're really skinny but
you know they're discounted they're in
the bin now and I've never had a light
pink pair of jeans and this is kind of a
seasonal trendy piece that I will
definitely say you know I won't wear all
year round but I'll definitely wear for
the next few months and I always say
that Jamie jeans are such a good fit of
jeans them at angle size I'm currently a
full size 10 so a 28 waist I mean I was
a 28 waist before but now I'm like a
really full 28 waist but I think I'll go
down to a 28 27 in the next few weeks in
the next few months so I'm happy that
these can stick to my wardrobe after
that I bought this mustard mustardy
coloured off the shoulder top
I love off the shoulder top right now
because my boobs are huge
and sometimes all you ever see is just
cleavage and boobie but off the shoulder
is a great way to have like cleavage
without having cleavage if that makes
any sense
and I love this color I am luckily
moving back to love and color on myself
right now and you know I don't care for
trends I just careful what I feel
comfortable in and it's a really nice
material it's really loose and really
flowy and you helps me cover all my
lumps and bumps and I feel
super confident in it I love it finally
I have this oversized jumper this
actually is a size 14 jumper but I like
buying things though a bit oversized so
that I feel comfortable in it right now
I still have a bit of a pouch and you
know loose skin and that kind of thing
so I've been wearing things that I feel
really comfortable in and I love this
color it's like a pinky color you guys
would have seen it in my last video and
on my blog
as well I feel like pink is like my
favorite color at the moment we'll see
how long that lasts but it's perfect for
Springs so next I have some pieces from
River Island and you guys know that I do
love river island and if you know
anything about England what we have here
is fake Sun it is me and you will be one
degree outside like why is it so cold so
don't get it twisted just because you
see sunshine doesn't mean that it's hot
which means that we can still be wearing
sweaters and knits this season so I got
this matching two piece it's this really
gorgeous skirt which is a cross-product
skirt like this and it is just
absolutely fabulous it's emitted it's in
like news which I really love and then
it's got this kind of oversized matching
jumper as well again you'll see that
kind of oversized on the top is what I'm
loving at the moment and I'll kind of
keep wearing probably for the next few
months until hardcore summer but this
can definitely be worn and this season
and you can see what they look like
together it's like really gorgeous and
love the color love the size and you
guys know that I love river island
anyway so next I bought a few pieces
from ASOS this address here is basically
my inspiration for when they get
everything back nice and tight and it's
a nice dress it's from ASIS but from a
brand called love triangle it was
actually only 40 pounds but I think I
don't have my kind of standout white
dress in my closet and I thought this
was it like I can't wait till I go on
holiday or wear this dress all the time
and then I bought a stand out piece this
is this and hopefully it doesn't look
orange it's kind of orange on screen but
and this is just this red jacket that I
think I'd wear over skinny jeans and a
vest and I'm the kind of person that I
might wear really basic clothes in
but then if you wear something with a
pop it makes such a big difference and I
was just like you know what it's bright
red but summers come in and I might just
want to throw this over something
especially if I'm on holiday and I'm
trying to plan right where we all want
to go to next then red always looks good
on chocolate good I also picked up this
denim shirt I have one light denim shirt
but I don't have a dark denim shirt it
was a size 38 which is actually the
European size but what I knew is that I
really wanted a really oversized denim
shirt in the dark so I picked this one
up as well which was perfect for what I
was looking for and then picked up a few
accessories as well
I bought this belt which is like a
western style belt so if you guys can
see the detail there I love these I love
these on the white jeans as well they
look super cool and I think the detail
is so so so nice I also picked up a net
Joker as well I have a thick one but I
didn't have a thin one and this is a
really nice a velvet one with silver
chain at the back it's just you know
simple it's like six pounds but they're
really nice and then I also bought this
three tiered choker as well which is
really nice when you want it to go down
you're you know cleavage area with
perfect on the dress like this and it's
cute I also have got one pair of shoes
and normally you guys know what when I
can buy like 10,000 pairs of shoes but
how because I had such a big shoe clear
out and I knew that I only wanted to buy
something that I knew was really gonna
work for me and I bought these pair here
which are actually Kendall and Kylie and
when I picked them up I never knew it
was Kendall and Kylie shoes but there
was so nice I just what the tassel was
super sexy and you guys know I don't
necessarily think I have the most
gorgeous toes in the world and really
don't
but the tassel kind of kind of covers
them so that you don't see too much toe
and they're just a really nice nude pair
of heels so I'm gonna move on to some of
the makeup bits I've got as well so I
have these lip palettes from L'Oreal I
had the red palette and I have the nude
palette and these are absolutely
gorgeous really it's nice to have a
little collection of just lip products
all in one and I haven't tried this
out yet but I know that it is just got
the most gorgeous news there and I love
Lamia lipsticks as well so I've got the
nude and I have the red as well which
look fabulous and oh my gosh I've just
mashed that up I'm really annoyed
because it looks so perfect oh well yeah
that's what that looks like I have a few
products for Matt YSL and I'm becoming a
bigger and bigger wire sell fan I have
these kiss and blush products these can
basically be used on the lips as well as
on the cheeks this is color 11 which is
perfect as a blush on my skin tone and
it's kind of like a nice deep color for
my lips and then this one isn't good as
a blush for my skin tone but it's great
on my lips this is kind of 12 which is
basically and like nude I also have
these nail polishes and this is called
coral dive in which is what is company
on my nose and it's a gorgeous coral I'm
probably gonna put these on my feet
because they look fabulous I love it
it's a perfect color for spring/summer
now I've also got some one gorgeous
products from Tarte I love Tarte and
then now have the nice shipping from
their UK site they did give me a
discount code but I'll see if it's still
active I don't think it's active anymore
sad times but if it is I'll link in the
description bar below but what I have
are their glossy lip paints and there's
basically a bunch of the glossy lip
paints which look like these aren't
showing them close up if I can the
crosstie lip paints which are absolutely
gorgeous they're kind of nudes and
purples and pinks right up my street and
then I also have the rainforest of the
sea I shadow palette look at this it is
just beautiful so beautiful I don't
actually want to use it the colors are
just the nude girls dreams and then I
also have the double duty Beauty eyes
and cheek palette and I've seen these
all over Instagram and I was like yeah
I'm gonna have it it's just gorgeous the
collection is fabulous again it's kind
of brought the news and the Pink's which
is what I wear but actually I do have an
eyeshadow that's slightly different I
forgot to show you this one this
eyeshadow here for myself look at it
it's purple do you guys want to see me
in this yes or no let me know because
you
how much of an aversion I have to color
but you know I want to try to think a
few things are a little bit different
anyway I had this
invisiblur perfecting shield and it's
kind of like a primer it is from Mourad
this pot and I'm going to wet in my
favorites but this product here sick
it's a primer it kind of gives you a
nice matte finish before you put your
makeup on and it is an SPF 30 as well
it's so good and it treats Blair's and
protects this I know that I'm going to
need like ten of these it's so so so
good now in the massacre have this
gorgeous gorgeous highlighter I've got
this as well I don't know what it's
called I'll link it in the description
bar below this is absolutely gorgeous a
good on my teeth today hopefully you can
see it it's just just it's just fabulous
with a fan brush whoa glow when I love
it and then I also have this and I have
any quality as well it's a nice matte
collection so yeah so guys those are
some of the things that I've gotten you
in and you don't know how good it feels
to kind of treat myself a little bit

really comfortable and confident in as
well as getting a little bit of beauty
to treat myself so I won't be doing

slash each season I will do a new in of
