video is going to be another fashion
video and it's going to be on spring
skirts and different skirt types and
styles that I'm currently liking and
like ways to wear leather skirt and yeah
thinking like that so I hope you enjoy
look I have here is a pitted against
clip and it's kind of got patterns when
it was polka dots but this to me is all
about like the whole floral very very
feminine look movement if you're like a
little girls can make one of these
skirts but still quite mature at the
same time I'm wearing it with a batwing
on top both of these items are for
furniture car the quite recent so I'm
sure you could find find it in my
thoughts
the officers circus tour Westfield or
something like that and yeah this is
kind of a nice way to wear spring scarf
that show a bit of leg that have the
best legs in the world but I don't mind
like Jerry Nemec mark you know and just
with some plain tan shoes have kind of
just look really sweet it's look kind of
really sweet and on an innocent and
really really casual like this is a
non-restrictive outfit at all it was
anyway face hi guys so this look here is
another plea to scar I really like in
pleated skirts I think they suit me
quite quite nicely and this is actually
in like a mock leather if you can kinda
tell Pete oh but yeah that's like a mock
leg of liver and it's from bush Co as
well and yeah it's really cute it's a
lion once again it's high-waisted as
well as you could put a belt on it put a
baggy top off the atop wearing it again
with the shirt that you saw me on before
and I really like it and I love the
never trend and I've got nothing in the
show and I'm gonna show you what
salutely shirts gone and I really like
the fact that it's kind of just nice and
really pretty once again be right hand
shoes and stuff and it's just really hi
guys so funny they look but I'm loving
is the proper leather look leather skirt
I feel very much like a biker and nice
and you know very ready to go kind of
hard so with the hardness of the leather
skirt I kind of caught on some pretty
pretty lace just to kind of softened me
up a little bit this is the kind of
thing I'd wear on a night out no not for
then I would wear this for dinner this
is just too hard I'll go to like a
gritty underground downplays that's what
this is what I've been this - yes I had
some red lipstick you imagine it with
red lips
yes yeah so lace this is from thule
shrug or cropped jacket from swing
jacket from H&amp;amp;M which I really like the
leather skirt is from H&amp;amp;M as well and my
ankle boots so guys that is the end of
my skirts video if you want more fashion
tutorials over I said in my last videos
just like these videos and if you like
them I can tell you like them I'll put
more and more up on a regular basis so
thanks for watching and nice all over
now come on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
