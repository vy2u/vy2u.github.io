first talk about it Tuesday you guys
know I love coming up with this series
is and they're always so popular and I
kind of like flag with them and I really
wanted to combine like their bright life
and goal problems all together and do a
weekly issue weekly ish choose they
episode where we can talk about lots of
different topics and you guys can come
in and send your suggestions of what you
guys want me to have a chat with you
about but I was asked this question by
one of my viewers on my Facebook page
but they aren't me how am I able to
combine and all the different things
that I do with my life and like stay on
top of things I'm going to be honest
with you a lot of the time I can be a
head full of chicken or say it was a
headless chicken a lot of the time and I
ended up being very very stressed out
and very very tired I realized being
organized is like an essential which are
living a happy life girls and I say this
especially especially to the girls
because you know we're always
multitasking we go bunch of stuff we got
to get done so how do we get organized
to achieve that so my first tip is
actually put the first things first
sounds really really simple but you
might not realize that you're not
actually doing this and wake up in the
morning you're gonna get Instagram
you're scrolling for you and Twitter
you're facing up and everything else
right and then you realize you're
running late for work and you're rushing
you're washing and I found that I was
doing that all the time I was just not
prioritizing the things that were
important to do and I was just doing
other things that was supposedly oh just
the five minute thing I'll be done in a
second and by the time you do all these
five minute tasks two or three hours
have gone by and the thing that is
really important to do is actually not
been done if you're someone who can
discipline yourself enough to say I got
going to do that thing although I really
want to do it and instead you do the
hard thing first you are going to be a
lot more organized and a lot more
relaxed you're finally it feels so good
to have done the biggest and the hardest
task and then everything else that
you've got to do next
seems like a doddle so put the first
things first the next thing is get a
diary a diary is essential like I can't
live without my diary
I've use a diary all the time like I may
be not big one like this this is a new
one but you can either get the diary
leads with the calendars in it for me I
just stick with the notepads and I have
sections in my notepads which tell me
every single thing that I've got to do
or areas which might be from home to
YouTube to work section things off and
even have an area for like dawdling
ideas great thing about having a diary
or a notebook is that you're able to
prioritize write a whole list of things
in that diary or in that notepad and
then what you can do is pick out the key
things that you have to do I have this
thing where I try not to do too much
which sounds really crazy but I only try
to achieve three tasks a day because if
you've got a to-do list with 50,000
things on it and it can be quite
overwhelming like oh my god I've got all
this to do and you actually end up doing
nothing of my big big task list I
basically write down three things I pull
out three things from that task list and
say these three things are the three
things that I want to achieve today but
you're not going to know what you want
to achieve in a day if you haven't
written it down this is going to sound
very obvious as well but I say get a
calendar
being able to write and plan out what
you're going to do is the rest of the
year even if it's in pencil you're not
sure it just gives you perspective
sometimes if you can't see what's going
to happen tomorrow or next week you're
like you're kind of run around like a
headless chicken if you got it all in
front of you you can sit in front of it
with a cup of tea and look
so feeling very very proud but know
what's going on and you'll also find
that with the calendar it lets you know
that you've got some breaks to maybe do
something extra have some extra time see
some friends and family you know all go
on holiday or whatever when it comes to
physical organization my tip is that
everything should have a place now this
can take a really long time and you know
I've been going through this process
when it came to this closet room but if
you're someone who can define where
everything should go or should be you'll
never lose anything if you know that
this drawer is always the underwear
drawer and this jaw's always the genius
drawer and this drawers always the
jewelry drawer you will always know
where everything should be at any given
time where you can compartmentalize your
life and have things in place and in an
order it really does get easier I'll be
real with you I'll be with you guys I'm
messy I'm really really really messy
like not dirty but messy like my clothes
are flying all over and if you like me
film videos you'll understand that you
have met everywhere all the time but
it's much easier to clear that mess up
and make a lot less mess when everything
has a place my next tip is cut out the
time wasting you'll find that in life a
lot of the time while you're
disorganized you're late for things it's
because you're probably wasting your
time on something you're not meant to be
doing or something that does not add any
value back to your life and this is
something again that I really found I
was doing which was wasting my time
social media watching tell you I don't
really watch telly about doing things I
just don't really need to be doing and
what you really need to do is identify
your time wasters now for me I found the
majority of the thing that a waste it
might
on was the thing that I love the most
which is YouTube I might be watching
beauty videos I might be watching cat
videos or I might be watching you know
some really weird things on YouTube the
thing about YouTube is that I love it it
is my you know my baby but the same time
it dreams so much energy from me but
work out what is your your time drainers
what's getting in the way of you doing
something productive or doing that thing
that you really need to do for weeks and
weeks and weeks and is sitting in you
know a list somewhere
screaming help me so but what I would
suggest is that not that you necessarily
cut things out but set a time to do
those time wasting things everybody
needs a break everybody wants to watch
what's in my bag video once in a while
you can do that but maybe you set a time
or a day in the week where you do do
that and that's a great way to a slot
stop the time wasting encroaching into
your precious time that you need to work
with but finally what you really need to
do is allow some time to be crazy allow
some time to not have a schedule or to
do what you want to do be random and be
crazy and set some time to do that so I
know that Friday nights I ain't doing
anything serious don't ask me young
questions if I want to sleep I want to
sleep
if I'm going to watch brave like I did
last night then I'm going to watch brave
if I'm going to eat cake in front of
Friday night TV then that's what I'm
going to do and you have to at least
give yourself something to look forward
to after doing all your hard organized
work but guys I wanted to let you know
that I've teamed up with audible to
offer you guys a one-month free trial of
an audio book of your own choosing all
you need to do is go to the site and
register and I'm becoming more and more
of a book lover and a lot of the stuff
that I have mentioned in this video is
because I've been reading and I've been
trying to be the best me that I can
possibly be so make sure you check out
the link is in
description bar below it's really really
good if you don't necessarily like
sitting down reading books you can
actually listen to them and they've got
such a huge huge selection of books as
well but guys I really hoped you enjoyed

comments below of what you would like to
