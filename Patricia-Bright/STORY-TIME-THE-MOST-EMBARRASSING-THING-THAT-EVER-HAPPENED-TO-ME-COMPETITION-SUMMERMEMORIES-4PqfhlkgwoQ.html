have a story time for you and I've
actually really been wanting to do
another story time since my last world
my last one was a little bit
controversial I didn't expect it to you
know get as big as it was but and yeah
it got like that but we won't do silly
things that when we are younger and you
live and you learn
and I am still here today to tell
another story time story so today I'm
going to tell you a story specifically
in relation to my summer story which is
when I spend a month all-expenses-paid
in New York as an intern and I've also
got an amazing competition for you UK
girls specifically to get the chance to
win a holiday over the winter period
thanks to diamond car insurance so stay
tuned to the end I'm going to tell you
all about it but you know if you want to
share us on a story go you might find
yourself with some winter Sun you know
so yes stay tuned and I have all the
details listed in the description bar
below so I'm going to get started get a
cup of tea or whatever floats your boat
as I let you guys in on this okay so
when I was I think I was 21 or 22 when I
went to New York I actually worked in
finance and it's quite funny because I
actually logged before vlogging ever
existed while I was in New York and I
think the videos might be hidden now but
basically I worked in finance and they
sent a group of all of the internship
class and to New York because the
company's a half an American company at
the end of the day so they always send
everyone to New York for a month all
expenses plays you know you is a group
of young people who don't really know
each other you know besides the six
weeks where we all work together and so
this is about to be the greatest
opportunity this is the first time I've
been away like abroad without my family
and I don't know what it was it's almost
like you know just starting uni and then
you basically decided you're going to be
do stupid things and yes you know you're
there for work but yes you know you're
about to live it up so when it came to
where basically they put us up in the
amazing hotel we stayed in the Sofitel
which is midtown Manhattan it's the most
beautiful hotel it's gorgeous and
basically everything was done in inside
the hotel so we had like daily classes
and lectures and that kind of thing and
it sounds so bad a company I'm saying it
I didn't make it to a lot of it so be
completely honest there were some
mornings that was just a bit like Oh
last night was rough and I'm gonna be
keeping it really with you guys okay if
you don't know I used to be an extreme
party party party animals for the Lord
Jesus get up and save me the first thing
I realized is that um like is it called
Delhi Belly or something but that is
really real and I found that after
eating the food for like you know a week
or like even three days that I was in so
much like I was in agony because I felt
like the food in New York was so rich
and by the time you're eating burgers
and you're eating food that was very
salty you're just like oh and then like
I was either constipated or the opposite
of being constant painted which is a
little bit free-flowing
another thing I noticed during my summer
time in New York is how friendly
American people were or New Yorkers were
and how open they were and it was a kind
of place where people would either they
knew I was not from there probably me
talking and then everyone would be your
friends so it was really easy to get
people's phone numbers it was really
easy to like meet up with people that
you don't know and like go for a drink
and go for a coffee so I do find that
you know don't worry about not meeting
people I feel like New York's one of
those places that you can definitely
definitely meet people you don't know
now what actually happened or the story
that I really wanted to tell was the
most embarrassing thing that ever
happened to me so and there's one night
where all of us interns you went to this
most like this gorgeous gorgeous
restaurant bar place I think like they
hide it out it was really really opulent
and really
I can't remember the details of well
what it was and I you know had my nice
outfit on I had my hair laid now my hair
laid meant that I was wearing a wig II
basically a were you part or wig or
something like that you know I wanted to
look valve a lumen and special and I
really did think I was absolute the
fryers fry in the world and I came in
you know high hills cooked a copper tin
and my friend makes-- in there with me
man you know she will remember this
story she watches this video and you
know sometimes you just need to have
your good friend who's going to help you
and things go wrong now and you know
what happens with the interns with the
guys they do get very little Airy
they're very friendly and you know where
you are
you're definitely that friend zones of
everyone at this point in time and they
do act a fool you know interns can act
an absolute fool and so basically the
boys at this point would very you know
liquidated should I say that and then we
want proceeded to dance and there's me
you know I'm dancing on the dance floor
like I'm gonna be up Beyonce is getting
my Beyonce on and then I don't know what
it is as people we're dancing isn't
their forte and so you know I'm dancing
and then the boys decide that the dance
move that they want to do and I don't
know if you guys know this dance move is
sandwich in like and it's not any song
like a good it's like a sandwich like
like you know have you ever watched it
Inbetweeners like they genuinely dance
like that and so you know me I'm just
going to join in yes for during the
awkward corny dance and then I happen to
end up being sandwiched between two of
the guys who then proceeded to sandwich
like they were I don't know that they
were not not so well you know and then I
proceeded to then fall on the floor that
could that not be the most embarrassing
thing the fact that now there's one boy
me and the other boy and then van we
fall on the floor in the middle of this
dance floor because clearly we're the
ones making a big old scene and then
what happens to have been this as
go down what's his name decides to yank
part of one's head as you go down on the
floor and once we decide to displace
from one's head and obviously at this
point in time what do you do when you
are braided up with a scarf
and the wig on the floor for everybody
in your internship class and just
everybody else in the middle of New York
that genuinely happened and obviously
I've got my girl my Keisha there whose
eyes are not real quickly on my piece on
the floor she grabs it she grabs me and
we run out of the door and at that point
in time you know when embarrass them it
takes you so you don't even know what
you're doing was just so embarrassed for
some reason we ran my two blocks and I
she had made my wig in her hand and I
had like my hand on my head and then we
proceeded to run just like two blocks
straight and I was like oh my gosh you
know where you're definitely right
deathly deathly deathly embarrassed like
there's no words to discuss how
embarrassed I was like tears of
embarrassment came out is a bit like how
am I ever gonna face any of these people
ever again like even now thinking about
it I feel so like like emotionally
embarrassed by like what had happened
and I was so angry that you know I came
in thinking I was at the issue Bob and
and it all got taken for me the second
the wig falling off however I was so
glad I had my friend who then once he
ran the two blocks or so and I got the
emotion out she then proceeded to help
me to him would place my piece and then
we silently you know calmly and walked
up obviously all my things were still in
the bar at this point in time so I
didn't go back in I didn't want anybody
to see me and then she got my stuff
with home however you know where your
like the next thing you still have to
see everybody else do you have to come
to the classes sometimes and the good
thing is that when people are so drunk
they don't really remember to me it
might have been a big moment but
actually other things happened in the
evening that clearly were more
uninterested and luckily I didn't end up
being the laughingstock of the class
based on that but overall I grew up so
much in that summer that that summer
time and obviously those embarrassing
things that happen to me and I don't
know why I feel like I'm one of them
people that silly things just happen to
me I don't know why not so much now that
I'm older but then I mean I've got so
many more stories like that ways like
Patricia really those are the kind of
things that shape you and make you into
who you are as you grow and get a little
bit older so yeah so that was my summer
memory and in New York so I hope you
guys enjoyed that and gave you a little
bit of entertainment I kind of feel like
I always wanted to share this story
because nowadays I'm just feeling less
embarrassed and I'm like you know what
I'm just gonna tell the truth once I
know what I hope and especially if you
get to laugh at me a little bit and I'm
sure you've all been there I'm sure all
of you I've had a hair piece fall off or
