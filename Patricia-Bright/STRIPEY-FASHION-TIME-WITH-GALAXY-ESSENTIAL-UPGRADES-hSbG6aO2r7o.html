hi guys so I thought I'll show you how I
kind of upgrade my look wearing stripes
because it's not really something that I
wear and often but it is quite nice like
stripes in the day or stripes in the
evening this striped jumper which is
from H&amp;amp;M it's horizontal stripes and a
lot of people say it makes you look a
bit wider but because this is kind of a
trapeze top I think it's okay and it
doesn't make me look too big and i
really like the fact that it's really
slim and really fitted on the arms so I
can kind of roll it up and then I'm
wearing it with coughs because cops have
become my new thing and these are cross
crafts which are from a sauce and I
think it just looks really trendy and
then also like a long chunky chain or
something looks really nice and like a
sweater like this so on the bottom are
wearing a pair of American power leg
games or just some lights fitted black
the aliens basically just so because
this top satrapies top and it can make
you look a bit bulky so on the bottom I
wanted to keep it really really slim and
light cover my ears with a home this top
here and then I'm wearing a pair of kind
of wedge flat form type shoes which I
bought in Spain and I love it because
it's got this little bar here which I
think it's so cute so that's how I kind
of upgrade my look with a striped top
for the daytime
so nice this is how I upgrade my evening
outfit wearing stripes and the looks
completely different I've taken my hair
up and I'm wearing red lipstick and when
this stripe dress which is from Topshop
and basically it's a lot more evening
one because it's thinner stripes and
also because they're vertical so just to
add a bit more edge to it I'm just
wearing a studded leather jacket and my
jackets from love clothing calm and I
added a little clutch bag as well which
is from H&amp;amp;M and it's also studied a long
way of my shoes which are from jeffrey
campbell rich as you can tell on the
quite dangerous but they're lovely so
guys i hope you enjoyed that video and
maybe think about using stripes to
upgrade and outfit see you guys later hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
