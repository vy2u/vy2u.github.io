going to do a styling video I feel like
I've not done a styling video in such a
long time it's been jus but I just
haven't felt that inspired you know but
I'm kind of on like a refresh and detox
and you know renew kind of tip at the
moment so I've been really feeling it
fashion wise I also went to London
Fashion Week as well so there are so
many beautiful people office I saw so
many shows and you know met up with
everyone and you know what you do that
it really does fill you with like lots
of excitement and obviously lots of
inspiration as well so I've got my mojo
back back mojo Beth yes I am holding a
cup of tea this is actually my cost cap
right here this teaser little tepid at
the moment but you do get yourself a
glass if you want to but today I'm going
to do kind of like a capsule collection
e style video inspired by what I've seen
during London Fashion Week and nowadays
I've mentioned to you guys I'm trying to
shop a little bit more carefully and you
know pick investment pieces and pick
styles and stuff that suit me so even if
I have been inspired by Fashion Week or
other people I make it work for myself
for me when I go shopping I want it to
be simple I do lots of shopping online
the majority of all the items I've got
off from vary up code at UK because they
have such so many different brands that
I like you know from all over I don't
have to go to each individual brands
website and I can find the brands that I
like on the very website as well and
they've got Colette plus which is Next
Day Delivery which is super quick and
super easy and that's what I want my
life to be like so get comfortable and I
hope you guys enjoy this video so number
one it's the 70s trend I do think is a
trend that you can end up going a little
bit overboard with so for me I love the
color palette and I love the texture so
suede and the Browns I really really
like and I will wear those but for me I
can't wear suede and brown all over
pick a key piece absolutely love this
button-down I'm Scott and I lost guts
got a little bit cheeky it's a little
bit short which is I work with over the
knee boot and but I think it's a really
nice piece and I paired it with just a
black polo neck I saw lots of people in
Poland egg jumpers and for me I just
need a polo neck jumper in black navy
gray and verizon D and I'll be a happy
bunny there's something about a polo
neck or turtleneck that some of you guys
call it that is just nice and I don't
know it makes you feel sophisticated
tread number twos got to be cocky and
it's a perfect color for the full season
and for autumn and for me this cocky
jacket is lovely it's oversized it's
kind of just the jacket style which is
my favorite style or jacket like
anything long wrap a ball I'm on it and
I love it I just love to be able to wrap
it around and then jumpsuits as well so
I do like a job too and this is just a
really nice white job suit so I think
white and khaki are amazing like wear
white jeans and a white shirt
partly Jackie it will not look like the
bottom together so it looks super nice
and after that you don't to forget your
accessories so your hats your bags your
scarves
those kind of things if you're someone
who doesn't have that much money to
invest in like lots of clothing and all
that good stuff just buy some you know
off the chain accessories and I love a
hat like the one I've got here just the
grade is the detail on it
great for bad hair days and genuinely
makes you look more done up and more
stylish than you might actually be that
you can wear something basic and look
great and then also a camel oversized
scarf one a scarf or pashmina because
they keep the show warm and they really
do bring outfits together
so she if you want to play with layering
and all that kind of good stuff so
definitely if we can't invest in lots of
new items you try and buy some uni
accessories if you can a polo neck
midi-length dress and doesn't have to be
polo neck but midi-length dresses are
something that I really do like because
if you are someone who's always in a
rush that kind of thing just throw on a
mini length dress okay I feel like in a
closet you definitely need like four of
these and different colors and stuff and
I love this one and of the car I love
the texture of it it doesn't have
sleeves which means I do wear a jacket
with it but for a night out then I would
just put it off and I can wait on boots
are coming feels like a mocha flat and I
feel there's something about just a
mid-length Jess that kind of looks put
together without having to look to put
together and it's super comfortable so
guys those are some of my favorite like
fashion essentials for the autumn season
inspired by fashion week and just me
trying to switch up my style and you
know I perfect it a little bit so that's
basically it I hope you guys enjoyed I'm
going to be doing loads more and I
mentioned I've been having like a you
know a refresh like a life refresher I'm
gonna do like a closet tour and all that
good stuff the Sun has just come out so
I am glowing like a disco ball right now
but I will link everything in the
description bar below and majority of it
is from very top coat UK where they've
got amazing clip+ service next day
delivery and all that good stuff and
lots and lots of brands to choose from
so make sure you check it out by the
meantime I'll catch you later I'm
excited to do lots more lovely amazing
videos so I'll see you guys later bye
but now it's time for a chatty video
time for me to sit down and just share
some thoughts with you guys and it's
taking me a while to come about to doing
this video because sometimes it's quite
hard to think about what to have a chat
about what I wanted to talk about
becoming a woman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
