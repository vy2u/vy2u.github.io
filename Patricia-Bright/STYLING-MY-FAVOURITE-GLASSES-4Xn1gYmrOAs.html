like I should be in Hogwarts right about
now with these glasses and it's kind of
midnight blue dress but I'm lovely here
and today I wanted to bring a video of
you sharing how to keep your skull even
if you're wearing glasses and just do a
little bit of a lookbook wearing glasses
as I have partnered with glasses at
usa.com who got an amazing crazy
selection of glasses at really good
prices up to 70% off and with over 2500
styles and you I had to get a couple of
pairs that I actually like for myself so
I hope you enjoy this
I feel like glosses nowadays are
actually a fashion accessory and I'm not
actually a glasses wearer shock horror
but I like to wear them once in a while
to kind of change up my look and these
friends here I feel like they soon
actually everyone because they're kind
of round and then they're very thin so
there's something about them that is
very geek chic I like to pair something
like this in like a leather jacket a
white shirt and denim jeans a really
simple look but something I feel that's
going to make me look really kind of
sophisticated smart but cool at the same
time right so this pair here on my
second favorite pair because they are
really a statement pair without being a
crazy color or anything like that and
I've seen a lot of girls wearing glasses
like this that's like oh my gosh you
look so like chic and stylish and really
fashionable and for me I think what this
is a perfect fashion pair of glasses and
I think pairing is something all-black
with a strong lip is a really good look
and these are more of a rectangle in
shape so those of you who have a bit of
a square face it might not necessarily
suit you and it might look a little
harsh but if you've got like a round
face or a hot shaped face I feel like
these are absolutely perfect they're for
this pair here I don't know if these are
called an aviator or not but there's
something about them that was really
kind of fun and very 70s and made me
think of a talking car I don't know why
for some reason it's kind of masculine
but with that 70s vibe and I feel like
what this needs is
basically some kind of suede and brown
and they're oversized and large but this
they say a lot and I think for those of
you who really want to make a statement
where you come into a place or like
you're someone who's really retro and
firm at these glasses are a really cool
pair and I remember during Fashion Week
I used to see so many people wearing
glasses like this and I never knew where
they got them from they've got that
vintage vibe which i think is a really
cool finally I have these pairs which
are the classic aviators and I think
these suit absolutely everybody
especially if you have a longer face I
feel like it kind of complements the
longer face and for me inators or a
classic pair of glasses sunglasses
they're literally perfect you can wear
these to the airport and I feel like
they look great on the hood as well and
I know loads of people say not to wear
the glasses on the head but I do it
anyway because I think it's really chic
and sophisticated but this is basically
if you are that cool guy and you have
that cool outfit it looks perfect on
that kind of person so guys those are
some of my favorite glasses from glasses
USA and I think that the price is so
good that you can get so many different
styles and for me as a fashionistas I
like to call myself switching up my look
regularly it's something I really enjoy
doing and you're able to kind of change
your personality and change your look
very quickly with a pair of glasses so
make sure you guys check them out they
also have a virtual mirror which is
really cool if you wanna upload a photo
and see what you look like then you can
do that they've got prescription they've
got non prescription and the prices are
phenomenal so then I hope you enjoyed
that video and I'll catch you guys in a
time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
