I've got a whole video for you what's
the whole video for me but I'm sharing
it with you and it's kind of like a
summer ash haul but obviously it's not
quite summer in London right now and
we've had some good days but you know it
is England it doesn't happen all the
time but I'm going on my first family
holiday or shows a full family holiday
we are going away we're going to
Sardinia which is a little island off
the coast of Italy so it's basically
Italy but it's kind of not Italy and if
you guys know I've been TT like live to
12 times okay eight times but um yeah I
go that all the time because like one of
my favorite countries to go to and I
have family there so I bought loads of
bits that you know could make me feel
good from kind of summery and it's not
just for this holiday but hopefully any
other holidays I do in the near future
and stuff so I got a little bit not
carried away I don't get carried away
anymore I try to by consciously
with thought and I really like some of
this on my bits that I've got so first
thing I've got a ton of sunglasses
because obviously you need sunglasses
when you are on holiday and I actually
just went to sunglass heart and sunglass
heart is super cool because it's got all
the designers that you need in one place
and personally I really do like
investing in a nice pair of designer
sunglasses
I think everybody should have at least
one you know pair that they feel really
special about in their collection that
for sure but there you can get like
Prada George Armani right band but like
they've got so many or I think I've got
most of the sunglasses so it's easier to
just go there and then compare the
different designer styles to each other
because you never know what pairs
actually going to suit you so I bought a
bunch basically so I've got this pair
here from Prada and it's got this gold
bar along the top and this is kind of a
textured effect on the frame which is a
little bit thicker than normal and
obviously it's got the classic prada
detail on the side and it's got quite
chunky arms as well I wasn't sure about
this but I've been trying to be a little
bit more you know inventive inventive or
creative or a bit more out there with my
sunglasses and the shapes kind of like
almost hexagon II and then yeah it's got
thick arms as well and it's
got the prior Prada details on the side
and honestly I don't think you can go
wrong with a pair of ray-bans Eva I have
these black aviators styles and they've
got the all-black frame and I think this
is a really good unisex pair so if
there's any guys watching I love this
pair and then I also got the ones with
the gold frame that's where like a model
modeling the glasses and it's also got
these go pair as well so yeah and I also
have a coupon code for sunglass hut in
the description bar below so make sure
you guys check it out and I'll have a
links to all of these glasses so this I
picked up from a source even though it
is from Aldo because out Able's
basically sold loads of different brands
and it's just this kind of tie net piece
in like a suede and I love the little
gold details and the little leaf detail
it has on it it looks super cute on and
I'm loving necklace detail at the moment
I then have these white bathing suit
cover-up and I think I'm going to be
wearing a lot of these at the moment I'm
just not ready to just get it all out
for the world to see right now you know
me one day one day soon but for me for
those girls who don't like to just show
everything all the time then a cover-up
is a really really good option and this
is actually a boohoo piece but you know
asel sells through and I love the tie up
front detail sticking with the swimwear
I basically bought so many pieces of
swimming and I couldn't find anything
that I felt really comfortable in all
that really suited me right now and
obviously it's a little bit harder to
just feel comfortable but I saw this one
and it was really really nice it's quite
sexy it's quite something
sorry excited it's quite sexy but um I
thought it's really nice like this mesh
detail kind of just keeps a little bit
of the boobies that covered but you just
see it just enough and then for some
reason the panel around here really
helps the tongue look a little bit
tighter and it kind of sucks you in and
this is an ASIS Oh brand swimsuit and I
just think it's absolutely amazing and
then I do have I do have a bikini top it
is
sexy red and it was from the I think
it's one like the larger the larger bus
range they have a really good larger
bust range for all you ladies out there
who are sporting them double D's and
bigger boobs and it's really really
supportive and I really like this here
and the color and the detail on this and
they had right red pants and red bikini
bottoms but I just didn't feel like they
suited me so I'm actually going to mix
and match with high-waisted black and
black bikini bottom because they
actually look good
so afters I have this dress here which
is beautiful on its own lab is a lace
which is a UK designer it's sold on a
zones but they do have their own site
it's in this gorgeous peach color and
this is like my goals outfit like I have
a really cool award show that I'll be
going to you can vote for me if you want
to it's going to be happening in Berlin
and this is the dress I'm going to wear
now right now it's not the most
flattering dress but it's kind of like I
am you know yet keep something that is
going to be your motivation this is like
my motivation dress like that means says
to me Patricia in this kitchen gym every
day you do to eat healthy not add fizzy
drink and get personal trainer so this
is the dress it's beautiful on and
fingers crossed that this is going to
look good and if not I just give it to
Maureen but I actually love it I love
the peach I love the fit of it super
elegant the materials really nice and
it's got this gorgeous split arm detail
you have to see it on like it's gorgeous
I love it so after that I have this
tooth piece set which is this striped
top and these striped trousers and these
are absolutely gorgeous
if you guys don't follow my blog do
follow my blog on blog laughing I'll put
a link in the description bar below so
you can follow me and over my blog I do
lots more fashion pose I do a lot more
like Pitre stuff
and more travel and lifestyle stuff is
on my blog so I have a link to my blog
blog and below but I wore this look over
on my blog and I just absolutely loved
it so many people were complimenting me
thank you guys so much and most people
thought it was actually a jumpsuit but
actually it's a two-piece it's a t-shirt
and the trousers and what I did because
I found that teacher
a little bit MooMoo I just tied it up at
the front to give me like a little bit
of a crop top effect and the trousers
are just the most comfortable perfect
fit ever and the great thing is that I
can wear these trousers or the blacktop
and I can wear these this top with the
black trousers you don't always have to
wear Co wards like together which I
really like so super nice and all summer
random than be wearing this so this top
is one of those tops that you have to
see on because it doesn't make any sense
it's actually a wrap off the shoulder
top that kind of Criss crosses and I
picked this up in this kind of really
cute blush color as well as a black
color and for me I love I love showing
like my shoulders I say that shoulders
is like the new cleavage if you don't
want to show these girls then show this
section it's so so beautiful and it's a
bodysuit as well so it fits all the way
down to the bottom and I have it in the
black as well super affordable and I
really felt like I needed to have a few
more Basics in my wardrobe so this is a
really nice basics that I'm adding in
and as I have neck piece of set this
neck piece here I think it'll go really
nice actually with that dress and that
wasn't actually part of my plan but I
realized that actually that would look
really good it's a really nice kind of
choking neck piece but it's got this
gold detail here really affordable but
looks really expensive I don't know it's
kind of nice and I've been really liking
things that kind of add more drama to my
neck area so that's really cute so next
up I've got a few bits from River Island
another favorite of mine and I feel like
I don't know recently that I've been
loving everything they've got and it's
really been suiting my body at the
moment so gorgeous so I got this off the
shoulder and denim shirt and as I said I
love a bit of shoulder cleavage it's
really sexy and this is just a really
nice pen and piece off the shoulders
really trendy when I hiked it before it
was trendy and I'm loving a lot of denim
yes it's got this tie front detail here
and the buttons down the middle and I
love the ruched detail as well I was
naughty I bought another denim shirt and
I know I talked about in my closet like
just trying to keep one thing of a
certain style but this means I've got
two denim shirts actually my
three this is only the third one but
this one's amazing because it's more
like a denim shirt dress yeah it's
different it is different and this is a
light color and I love the neckline
because it isn't a shirt that goes like
buttons all the way to the top it kind
of has that V and that V kind of suits
me and at the moment and I just think
it's a really nice well-made shirt and
it's beautiful beautiful and I wanted a
dress but I can wear just over you know
a step into the beach but go out for
dinner this dress here is in this
beautiful blush really nice chiffon
detail and it's long but it has a short
insert in the middle and then it's got
these on the side so it's got really
nice movement and flow you see it's
flowy it's moving so I'm gonna get
carried away I go to my own world when
I'm talking to myself so I also have
this coordinating set here it's a car
key set and it's got slouchy trousers
which I am just loving at the moment I
have said that slouch is like my new
favorite thing and these are just a nice
car key pair and what I really like was
that this jacket kind of matched with it
and I can make a vest a little crop top
as you know crop top I can wear a little
vest on the inside and then just put
this over it and this is actually on
sale for 22 pounds these aren't yet but
I think sales season is coming around
the corner the corner so do keep your
eyes peeled and then went ahead and
bought some skirts just two pencil
skirts I got one in the tan and one in
the black and they're over the knee I
kind of wanted pencil skirts that have a
little bit of a thicker material then
your standard Jersey because I found
like with the Jersey ones you could just
see everything but these arms are a
little bit more of a thicker material
and I feel like they're really good
basics to have in your closet so I have
these in the black and in the camel and
this one was on sale so I'm sure at some
point in time this will go to sell I
have all the links in the description
bar below so hopefully you can get
stale stuff and finally I just have this
rap black leather skirt here which has
got this gorgeous tidy type the side and
it's kind of asymmetric so there's just
an extra long bit as well I have one
other leather skirt in my closet that I
loved loved loved but right now it's so
tight I was just looking for too skimpy
and I needed a new alternative and this
was perfect it looks really expensive
without being expensive which is amazing
so I just bought two pieces from
misguided which is this top I bought it
in the car key on my snapchat
everybody's been asking me about this
top literally and I wear it all the time
it's just a nice misguided piece is
super simple and I also have it in the
black as well so I'm not really a
sneakers kind of girl or sneakers I'm
not American I'm not a trainer kind of
girl but I really like I just like
things that suit me and comfortable and
I have these tubular trainers which are
from addy death and whenever I've worn
them everyone's like those trainers are
so cool they're so nice I'm like really
am i cool though
hey I'm cool and they're really
comfortable they're so light and I
picked them up on a zorse as well I'm
really hoping they still ask them I have
been linked in the description bar below
but if not I'll look at some
alternatives and they kind of remind me
of that the Yeezys ish I mean kinda but
they're just very comfortable and a
really good pair of trainers and I've
been wearing them all the time so guys
