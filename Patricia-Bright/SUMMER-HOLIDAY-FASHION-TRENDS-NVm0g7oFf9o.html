video is going to be entirely on the
clothing that you need for your holiday
essentials and for the scenarios that
you're going to be in what you really
need to cause I think that's thing you
really need to consider is your Beach
where they're not necessarily your
bikinis or anything like that but what
you're gonna wear over your bikinis you
know when you're walking home from the
beach or when you're on your way to to
the beach you don't you know have to
throw on some jeans and you're covered
in sand and awful stuff so you know you
don't need that so what are the things I
think you need well one you know the
ever famous sarong is not going anywhere
and I've showed you guys this before but
this is the song that I got from Azoff
and that I really like and it's got um
it's gold twirly thing there and this
sarong right if you've got a thong on it
looks like a gong you have a bikini on
this you will not be wearing a thong
bikini no this is not Brazil okay so you
just have this song throw over your
bikini bottoms it's like it's Aryan you
can dry off and it won't feel weird on
your skin when you're covered in so you
know there are these really loose long
t-shirts that you can get from H&amp;amp;M so
I've got one of these here but you know
you just slip it on and it's gorgeous
with the bikini on it
so next up you're gonna want to look for
your day where and I think they reckon
sisters kind of two different elements
you're either looking at some kind of
shorts or you're looking at some kind of
long or a floaty dress and I kind of got
a pic of two I've got my really nice
long cobalt blue maxi dress with
obviously the wooden board details on it
and it's just you know you just just
clip it on and even if you've got a
bikini on top as well it can get really
really nice
if some other types of day where are
gonna be your shorts and your floaty
t-shirts
these are thrifted about these ages ago
but they're really nice folded carpet
Charles there's and just loose and easy
you can wear those of some kind of
chiffon or see-through shirt a niche I
feel like that's going to be my daily
uniform
finally you need to get ready for your
nights out in whatever country you're in
and this these differ because some
countries you go to people aren't very
much quite trust down when they go out
at night and then some countries you go
to and people are really really dressed
up really with a sheik depending on what
cities I know really and considered that
but I think you should equip yourself
for both so I've got a gorgeous denim
dress which is from H&amp;amp;M a corset denim
dress which I hope this shows you and
you know this is nice for the for an
evening it's not too long it's not
cheesy you know that's quite casual but
then if you think you might be going to
some of their quite a swab it's right
classy you don't know it could be lots
of expats you can go for like a gorgeous
statement black dress black fitted dress
and I got this dress from H&amp;amp;M and it's
this gorgeous mesh on the top that I'm
really loving at the moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
