lookbook for you and it is crop top
inspired over wearing cropped tops
literally every single day know about
the perfect stomach but there's
definitely ways to roll with it I love
this crop top it is from River Island I
love the high neckline and I love to
work with anything that's high waisted
because it just covers my belly button
and my pouch and I'll link everything in
the description bar below so you can
find out where to get the items but the
tops River Island the shorts are a
racist and my sandals are from JustFab
this crop top is my favorites from the
Topshop what I love about it is that
it's a little bit longer than most pop
pop so it doesn't show too much but it's
got this laser cut detail in it and I
paired it with these gorgeous patterned
sports which are actually from Primark
and I bought them for like 7 pounds of
bargain
it's my go hard or go home
and I'm wearing this t-shirt which is
from Topshop
it's a cropped t-shirt obviously and
what I'd like to do when I feel like my
stomach is a bit overexposed I just kind
of wrap a shirt around especially as I'm
wearing shorts and it just kind of keeps
me a little bit more covered up and a
little bit more comfortable especially
when I'm caressing a pole my this
necklace is gorgeous it is from regal
Rose just look at the color it's so
gorgeous
I paired it with my favorite boots which
are from Zara
so next is more of a swing crop top look
this is from Topshop I bought it a
couple of months back now but it is very
very short so I'd like to make it look a
little bit smarter and I've got this
team piece matching suit which is from
River I learned and just love the color
on this it's so blue and so feminine and
I find that with an extra you know short
crop top like this it's best to wear
things that are loose and floaty and
I've just covered up my shoulders
my favorite crop it's literally blow
it's literally glowing I just love the
sequence of everything on this but
because it's so bright I like to pair it
with like jeans and trainers it just
makes it look extra cool versus like
over glamorous I love like that kind of
mix of like you know yeah these are just
my night trainers and I'm just a side
bag and my denim jeans which are high
waisted and they're from Topshop and pop
shop as well yes super casual and it's
great for just hang around in the park
so guys those are some of my summer
looks that are cropped inspired let me
know which outfit was your favorite if
there were any but in the meantime I
have all the details in the description
bar below and if you have any questions
that you have for me then please leave a

lots of love over there just for you
