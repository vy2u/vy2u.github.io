of me and his palace while I was on a
trip last weekend and I stayed probably
in the most gorgeous hotel I've ever
stayed in and I just had to take a
moment and shoot get ready with me at
least just to store the memory so go
ahead and wash my face and brush my
teeth just to get ready
this bathroom had like twin sinks but
office shower every is insane gorgeous I
used my favorite moisturizer which is
from the Skin Clinic it's a really light
moisturizer that I'm using underneath my
makeup and then I go ahead and add my
NARS foundation currently this is a
foundation I'm really enjoying and it's
got a really nice rich color
so next I'm moving on to my brows which
you guys know it's a Mac dip down and my
urban decay angle brush this is
literally what I do every time I kind of
line them up as much as I can and add
some light strokes as well my brow
routine has basically stayed exactly the
same and I'm loving it
and I go ahead and like in seal with my
Bobbi Brown concealer which is something
I've been using for a really long time
and just really loved so I wanted to be
extra Parisian and elegant and the
Peruvians always were very light and
natural makeup so I've gone for this
kind of light bronzy color which is
called Tsuburaya format NARS it's one my
favorite and then I add gold in my tear
duct it's like my favorite look at the
moment as well there's a bit of a bit of
chocolate in my crease just to kind of
give me a little bit more depth I think
I had with some liquid liner
I loved her wing my eyes just to add a
little bit more definition and make my
makeup look a bit stronger and then I go
ahead and add some mascara as
well to my lashes I'm contouring with my
Estee Lauder Double Wear in the dark
color just my nose slightly and I just
use my finger to blend it in but I just
love the way this looks and I'm also
using Double Wear to conceal this
applicator is everything it just makes
it so much easier especially because I
only have like half of my makeup kit
with me I am adding a color called
cherry onto my cheeks it's from Bobbi
Brown it just gives me a little bit more
color and depth and I'm using my nice
brush to just highlight a little bit on
my cheeks I love this brush for
everything I'm running my lips with a
dark brown but I've gone ahead and added
a bit of a cherry on top of it I changed
my mind about the colors and I put this
Salim on from Lime Crime but I didn't
think that looked of to Paris so I went
ahead and took it off and they put this
kind of nude color which is from Jordana
which I thought looked a little bit
nicer and moving on you've probably
noticed that my hair is now long and
curly you guys know I can't keep the
same hairstyle I've gone for like a body
way because I just think it's pretty and
I've been loving wearing my hair slicked
now I do have a weave in so I have to be
careful or the tracks you know letting
everyone know that they aren't there but
I kind of just leave my edges out lots
of people ask me exactly how I do this I
might do a video on it let me know if
you want to see that and this is like my
favorite hair trick it's you know using
a toothbrush and some gel to kind of
slip down the edges I just like this as
a look for the moment I might get bored
of it but for now I'm loving it so you
don't have to do this if you don't want
to do it but I really do like the baby
hair look and I go ahead and I use a
headscarf is just lick everything down
after 10 minutes I just whip it off and
go ahead and put my outfit on this is my
Zara jacket which actually hasn't had
that much wear but I definitely wanted
to wear it here and I'm loving wearing
colors it makes me feel so much happier
I then go ahead and spray some perfume
this is Tom Ford I love it and this is
my finished look I actually ended up
changing to a white shirt because
actually it was so so hot and
and actually I changed my jacket at the
end of the day but I love this look it
makes you feel really elegant in Paris I
had an amazing time on the cash and
rocket tour which is all over my blog if
you wouldn't actually find out more
about why I was in Paris but in the
meantime have a great Sunday and I'll
catch you all later thanks for watching
guys bye I'm gonna do a us a home
shopping let me do a quick whore so
while it's all fresh you know I don't
know what's gonna happen I'm gonna share</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
