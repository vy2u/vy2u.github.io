update you guys have been asking for
ages like for update what's going on
what's going on and like I've not been
evasive I just haven't had the time to
sit down and record the update video and
there's so much information and I feel
like I just don't want to bombard you
guys in just so much like stuff and like
again I would give out too much
information you don't need to know
everything but yeah II guess I don't get
that much to be honest so I'm gonna give
you an update like on my entire life and
in a 10 minute video yeah if you guys
want more stuff like I'm on Twitter so
you can follow me on Twitter I've
created a Facebook fan page as well and
I want to discuss this a bit later but
there's this website that I found and
you can kind of do vlogging live like on
your phone so kind of hope you've got
Twitter updates and you've got Instagram
like you could get live video updates
from me so I've created an account from
there and you can do it literally just
need your email address and your name
and you can sign up and then I'm gonna
be doing live updates on there like with
my life and all the stuff that's going
on in the next few weeks which you
really want to know so let's get started
with this
so in general and that's good that's
good god has been good to me his
favorite shot upon me so I got married
just over a month ago you all know that
got married the wedding video so you
guys are literally hunting me down with
steaks like where's the wedding video
Patricia I've got my footage now I've
got my content I've got it all and
forgot you guys who may not know I
actually like made a really rush dis not
a rash decision but I mean the biggest
control freak in the entire world and I
thought to myself no one's gonna put
together a wedding video how I want it
put together so they sit there paid for
someone to capture the footage and a
cousin of mine also captured footage
with high quality cameras and I've got
over footage and I'm editing my wedding
video myself easy peasy
simple pimple so the video that you guys
see will be what I've edited I've got
the footage I've got all my pictures
everything I'm putting it together so
hopefully this weekend
thumbs up have you on it this weekend
yeah this weekend or maybe next weekend
I'll have the video off yeah about how
you doing it don't worry no more man
and so yeah that's that information so
honeymoon you guys have arts loads and
loads and stuff about that
what's amazing is beautiful yes we did
go to Mauritius it's a beautiful island
in the Indian Ocean I could tell you
honeymoon story I could tell you stories
I could tell you the dead crash I almost
ducked thanks to Michael but again I'll
do that unlike that vlog channel if you
want it like if you wanna hear the story
let me know yeah I was like crying in
the middle of an island there yes Eddie
her so that was beautiful we're there
for 11 days and we stayed in a beautiful
resort on the island so that's it we're
back now honeymoon dad so you guys right
so are you living now
Patricia what's going on so here's the
update with that one and me Mike
actually because we've never lived
together before as a we kind of didn't
really organize where we gonna live yeah
bad so he works at a hospital and based
on his career and they have hospital
accommodation but we are basically
living in one room hospital Commendation
now we work on a rent find somewhere to
rent but the thing is is that we're in
the position to buy so you thought you
know let's just stick it out in the room
with a sink and we'll see how it goes
and we've been how long we've been in
out like two weeks is like it's kind of
in like one room cuz my kind even oh
really because right and I'm used to
just space and just you know sprawling
where I want to sprawl now literally for
to film this video I have to like
rearrange the entire room to film a
video so but we're in the process of
house hunting so this is what I was
gonna say we're seeing properties like
all over London and stuff like that so
if you guys like with this current is
called can do calm and I cannot use my
iPhone and
live like as I'm going around properties
as me and my kid going around so if you
think that's a good idea again leave a
comment so I'm not drawing my profile on
there because I'll definitely be
uploading like when I'm out and about it
next weekend I'm seeing like no this
weekend I'm seeing like 12 houses or
something like that so you wanna see
what London property looks like join me
on can do calm yeah but it's only if you
guys think it's a good idea but I think
it's quite fun cuz all this stuff I keep
for like my memories like Oh with me and
Michael looking for a house I remember
that day like all that kind of stuff so
we're living in one room we're living in
a town called Guildford which is in
sorry I think that's a bit too much
information but that's probably a bit of
my problem I kind of give out all my
information but now it's not it's not
enough telling you where we live but you
know yeah so we're in that area and it's
actually really really beautiful but
it's outside London so it's really that
it's hard for me to get into London it
cost me so much money
oh and I have an apology to my friends
like I love you like Kisha and now any
income Manik Warren who's my sister just
everyone like and all the people who
attended my wedding like I basically
haven't been able to say thank you for
coming to my wedding the reason being
and that my phone was stolen at the
airport yes on Facebook maybe I was a
bit careless or something but basically
I had my phone in my bag and was kind of
on the way back into England and we kind
of had their conveyor belts and they
know that I had my phone in my bag and
then by the time I you know got all my
luggage my bag my phones all day so I
was a bit you know upset about that
phone missing all my contacts like all
my oh you know congratulations that's it
so I was sad about that and like all the
YouTube girlies like who all came and
stuff I've not been able to say thank
you for coming everything about I love
you and I'm so grateful so yeah that's
also something I wanted to do yeah
forgot so and can you imagine yeah
people nowadays
oh god I've been all 4s now with a
beautiful case on Commission my case
look how cute that case is like you see
I don't know it's like embossed it's
like golden boss so what is it else that
you wanted to know
it was about my job so I've mentioned
that I quit my job I've got a new job
but basically by an amazing opportunity
came up for me to join a firm another
firm right and it's like not that I'm
like a big firm hunter but because I'm
quite early in my career right now
I want to say we're firms our top five
in the world and then go into smaller
firms so I had the opportunity to join a
firm I was like top four in the world
for its sector and I couldn't really
pass it up and also they gave me like
they said when do you want to join and
the right dates that I could join and it
gave me a good amount of time to kind of
quit my job like get married go on
honeymoon have some time off kind of
find a house and stuff like that and
then start with them so really it was a
no-brainer for me top 4 firm in the
world time off to get married and sort
my life out and I don't know just
another opportunity so that's kind of
the main reason why I'm moving it and
its smallest in the in it more directed
in the industry that I want to be in for
those of you who don't know I'm kind of
like a consultant with banking
consulting because I'm quite refreshing
and fashionable but unprofessional
actually if you guys want to see like a
walk a walk a work wardrobe video I can
do that because you can kind of see me
like empower suits like it so I have to
go to work
so I'll do one of those if you want me
to leave a comment below no did so sorry
guys I was talking too much
and my battery died and probably the
lights change because it's got a lot
darker cause it took like an hour to
charge my battery so I'm gonna go stop
talking now and say thank you very much
for watching I got playing I'm not going
anywhere basically so I've got plenty of
time to tell you lot more about married
life being a newlywed all that kind of
stuff so yeah I'll see you guys later
