wanted to do a springtime get ready with
me I clearly got very excited and I
posted this look on Instagram and so
many people liked it so I was like I'm
gonna recreate this for you and show you
something so hope you enjoy so first
things first I start off applying my
primer and this is the insta blur from
the body shop I love this it gives me a
smooth base to start off with after that
I'm applying my Lancome ten adult
foundation you guys know that it's one
of my favorite I feel like it matches my
skin really really well but also it just
gives me a really smooth matte finish
after that I'm concealing with my Kevyn
Aucoin concealer this is old-school I've
had this for like over a year it's time
to refresh but there's something about
this concealer that I absolutely love
when it's blended in well it just looks
gorgeous and it's just a nice full
coverage concealer I also like to do
their kind of reverse contouring as well
just to kind of add some dimension to my
Hapai hairdo you know so moving on to
eyebrows I'm kind of gonna show you my
updated brow routine I use dip down an
eyebrow gel from Mac and I'm using this
really cool and position eye liner brush
from Urban Decay it is amazing I do a
line at the bottom and line at the top
and I basically just give it a nice
little bail-in I usually try to extend
it out and then I will use my concealer
to basically meeting it all up
so once I've considered my brows I'd go
ahead and just blend everything in with
my Beauty Blender just to neaten up any
kind of harsh lines that I might have so
I am using the BH Cosmetics Missy Lin
palette go ahead girl do your thing she
is another youtuber if you don't know
our channel do check it out but this
palette is amazing the colors are super
pigmented and I've gone for this kind of
burnt brown on my lid and then a darker
color in my crease and honestly I love
palettes because I have not got
to start faffing around with lots of
different pots so this is a wonderful
palette I go ahead and then add a darker
Brown in my crease this is a dark brown
from Bobbi Brown just to add a little
bit more depth to my eyes and then go
ahead and add some gold to my tear ducts
and it just gives me a little bit of a
brighter eye look and I always do a
winged liner you guys know that I love
it and I'm going to just add some
mascara to make my eyelashes look extra
long after that I am showing you how I
put on eye lashes I'm terrible at doing
this so but I wanted to show you what I
like to do this is how I do it I use the
Ardell they're amazing and I get them
for 109 people one that in that I am
using the sleek contour kit which you
can see gets a lot of use I am just
using that just to give my head a little
bit more shape but I do need an
alternative and I'm busting a little
dance move as well as you do for my
blush I am adding a cream blush from
Bobbi Brown it is called cherry I love
this I almost use it as a contour
because it is quite rich and it's very
easy to blend in now moving on to my
lips
I've been rocking this lip and loving it
I'm using chestnut and lip liner from
Mac just to create some definition I've
been doing a lot of nude looks this is a
color called deep mink from Tom Ford and
it's just a nice natural and easy lick
to do especially with some gloss over
but that's basically my finished makeup
look I love it
now we're gonna move on to the hair as
you guys can tell my hair has changed
again I've got a deep side part I was
inspired by Kim K's initial car that
didn't have the platinum blonde bowing
on and I thought it looked really
elegant and I wanted to kind of do
something along those lines I don't
really need to do that much besides work
on my edges that you need you know the
help that they can get but I usually
just use my dark and lovely job just to
slick down my peppercorns and all that
kind of stuff sadly my hair is
relatively new for a writer but I'm just
gonna leave it but yeah my side part is
really easy for me to do and to her
and that is my finished hailer so
finally the outfit this is a tunic top
from forever 21 people on Instagram
loved this I just played it with my own
Topshop jeans which are very ripped as
it stands and my new airmax
ultra moi trainers which are buff I love
them so so much I love the color and
everything and but this look was super
popular when I did it on Instagram I
think it's cause it's so simple and
everyone could wear it if they wanted to
you know so guys that is basically the
end of my video I really hope you
enjoyed and it gave me some springtime
inspiration I'm gonna do a lot more
fashion videos very soon so if you have
any requests or there's anything you
want to see let me know and any video
ideas I'm super open to them so have a
lovely weekend and Mother's Day and I'll
catch you all soon thank you for
watching bye guys and I wanted to do a
video all about choosing the right
foundation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
