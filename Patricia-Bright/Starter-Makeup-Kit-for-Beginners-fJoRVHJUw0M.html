video is going to be on how to build
your makeup collection I've mentioned in
another video that this is what I was
going to do and it's part of my you know
everyday makeup and more wearable makeup
series so I'm quite new to makeup and
I've been on YouTube a while I've never
been that grivet the whole makeup thing
I'm getting better at it and I was never
a fan of these really elaborate and
dramatic looks because I just thought
that these cannot be worn you know on
the road like where are you going like
that but anyway so and I know that a lot
of people are new to YouTube and new to
the whole makeup thing you don't have to
go out and you know get all all this
dramatic stuff so when I first started
out I've got one of the palettes and so
I get a lot about the palettes which is
my thing they call it the 120 palette
and mine has been used well I might pick
this up on ebay you can get any just any
brand it doesn't matter there's nothing
special in any of them and I got this
one on YouTube and it also comes with a
bottom layer and that's in those colors
I can tell you right now I have never
used a single thing on that layer and to
be honest I only used the Browns the
Browns the yellows and maybe some of the
purples and the blues on the rare
occasions so if you're just starting out
you're best off getting one of these
you'll spend about seven to eight pounds
on it or 20 pounds in total including
shipping and stuff like that and then
you can get a feel of what you actually
wear and what you actually don't wear
when lord i know doing your makeup and
stuff also i love like sleek has really
good inexpensive palettes so this is one
of my sleek storm palettes i do use this
quite regularly I really love the blue
Venus and some of the highly lighting
colors although it does come out a bit
powdery at times so when you're ready to
graduate and go on to the Mac which is
what I think you know I've won my award
now I'm
to graduate and I'm joking there's no
awards hmm I moved on to Mac not for me
personally because I don't wear all
those bright colors and stuff like that
you want to start out with your neutral
base colors the colors that match your
skin tone nothing too bright no orange
or whatever in the beginning now and
because it's quite an expensive thing to
do you should just start off with what
you're going to use regularly then once
in a while you go out and get you know
one of the popular colors or one of them
you know elaborate colors that you want
to try so I basically have gone off the
suggestions of other people and I'm so
glad for certain people who have made
certain suggestions on on certain colors
that are just amazing to use and the one
thing also that I started to do was to
get fillers instead of the actual tubs
so you can get these in map and I think
these are um 11 pounds I think so
what you've got is although like
packaging and everything in the color
inside these are 11 pounds however you
can get a filler which is the exact same
size and you can get it for nine pounds
which I bought instead I also bought the
pro palette case which you can then fill
up with the colors you're interested in
putting in there so they've got the
small one so this is the chords you can
also get you know the bigger one if
you're really thinking of developing
your kit collection I would suggest you
invest in the bigger one the big one is
11 pounds so I probably going to get two
little ones that one big one so yeah
that's just another money saving tip in
the long run um so what colors would you
want to start off with well what you
want to do is start off with your
neutrals so for me you know and brown a
bit lots of browned and lots of nude
colors and then you want to start with
your shadowy colors and your
highlighters so on the on the lid
a popular one is wood wings and we're
good winked now which I hope you could
tell and yeah it's amazing
wood winked I think is a classic and a
standard but even if you're white black
white definiteness is a standard that
can be worn on a daily daily basis and
yeah it's a really cute color and then
you can start kind of building up your
your strength is it just ransom how well
you want to go over the makeup next up
you want to get your like your crease
colors what you're going to kind of
create some depth of your eye with and
expresso is a very popular one if you're
you know why or like this may be a bit
dark but for girls with my color
expresses a very good one to wear in the
crease I lightly wear that in the crease
so those are just your basics and then
you've got your highlights on rice paper
is the highlighter of choice that has
been mentioned by everyone and so I like
what rice paper as well I've not got it
on what rice paper is a very very good
one so after that you can start thinking
about okay what colors do you kind of
like still kind of neutral not nothing
elaborate but you still like so for me I
do quite like pinks and coppers and
stuff like that so I picked up a shadow
called umm cranberry and it's not too
bright I hope you can see it's not too
bright but it's got that hint of color
in it so that's you know about me all
being you know getting a bit braver I
tried something different and then I
bought a very similar color which I
wouldn't suggest necessarily doing but
yeah that's a similar color that I
picked up which is called star viola and
I tried this on now that you know what I
would not feel embarrassed walking
around all self-conscious walking around
with these colours on the London
Underground and that's how you have to
think so after you made that initial
investment you know you're good to go
for at least two months the next thing
you probably want to do that just to
pick up your lipsticks so if you're
going to go for Mac pick up to I think
you should pick up one bright color
be a pink or red so you guys have seen
me a ruby rune like every every weekend
I love Ruby whoo and I think that's a
red that suits everybody every skin
color rooby-roo that's the red for
everyone and then you want to pick up
one nude if you like nude on one pinky
so I've got lust up I have quite a few
different news online and a nude would
be one to go for that you feel
comfortable with everyday and if you
want to pick up blue lipstick go ahead
and pick up blue lipstick in the future
so also what you need to do is get your
basic face look so your foundation and
I've if you suffer instances you're
quite dry foundations great if your oily
you pick up your powder you can pick up
one or the other or both or tinted
moisturizer and then finally you want to
pick up your blush and be that mad I'm
not really fussed about my blush I'm
using a sleek brush that I've had for
like ages so it's not going anywhere so
guys literally that is how to build up
makeup collection from you know for new
beginners for anyone who doesn't want to
spend too much money in the very
beginning you just kind of go slowly
definitely start off with the whole 120
palette thing it's very good they're
quite oh my gosh there's a heron oh okay
sorry guys
oh my gosh it's gone sorry you know
might not know that I'm a bit of a bird
freak anyway let's get back to the video
yeah
to start off with the 120 palette and
yeah there you go
I hope you enjoyed this video all right
guys
surrounding me I'm gonna kind of show
you the view that I deal with when I'm
yeah so obviously if there's a heron
flying across I'm gonna see it that's my
gut didn't he
usually those foxes and stuff as well
guys that's just me being random
thinking about but I just let you know
that I'm not crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
