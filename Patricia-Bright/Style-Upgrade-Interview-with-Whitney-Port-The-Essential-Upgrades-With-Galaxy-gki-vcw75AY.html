we have a lovely feature all part of the
galaxy essential upgrades and we have
Whitney port here with us so you would
need you want to introduce yourself
yeah hi I'm Whitney and I'm here in
London talking about fashion doing it's
a bit about yourself where some of us
might know you phone cuz some of the
viewers might know okay yeah well you
probably know me from MTV's the hills
and the city and then a couple years ago
I launched my own collection Whitney Eve
so that's what I'm currently working on
so guys we're going to arcs Whitney a
few different ways that she likes to
upgrade her wardrobe her star from
spring to summer and just see what she's
got here with us today LA to London
which is basically from sunshine to
pouring rain and gray skies what would
you add or change to your everyday kind
of casual la outfit to kind of fit in
here I think the most important thing in
terms of coming from warmer to a little
bit colder is Larry I bring a little bit
of a heavier jacket and you have this
jean jacket with the leather sleeves
that I may not necessarily have to wear
during this time in Los Angeles and then
I have a cool scarf like one of those
circle scarves that you wrap around then
it's not too heavy but will just keep
you a little bit warmer when you walk in
the streets let's say you have a really
cool party to go to and we had on jeans
and a t-shirt ain't got maybe $30 so not
a lot of money too
by two items to kind of judge that
outfit up and get ready to policy okay I
think a big thing would be a really cool
blazer so I think if you go to a vintage
shop and buy kind of like a printed or a
sequined blazer you can definitely find
something like that here I mean I know
I'm the east side of London I've been to
many vintage shops or you can find a
sequined little something to put it over
to fish it up a little bit okay so we've
got a rail of items here I don't know if
anything a lot of girls have probably
had in their wardrobe losing some shirts
of things he he chose any ways that they
can be worn in more than one I think a
lot of what we're seeing in so many
different wardrobes is that typical
men's work shirt that's made out a
little bit more feminized so it can be
worn so many different ways I mean here
I have let's see this one person but you
can dress it up and dress it down the
other for instance if I wanted to wear
this with a cool pair of slacks what
yeah we would say Charles's route
they're gonna chalk this up as you want
to wear this with just a pair of black
trousers you haven't dressed this up
with a pair of heels and some jewelry or
you can dress it down with a pair of
sandals and Indiana jacket over it I'm
sure we all have a show yes can you show
yeah white collar get it exactly I mean
that a white shirt can match with any
much anything a committee could you know
give our viewers a few ideas on how they
can upgrade a really plain basic alright
sound okay well I think one of the
things that so many people have in their
wardrobe is just a basic black dress so
I have here this black dress that I
brought so we have this basic black
dress but I think a way to make a little
bit more exciting is to add you know a
big piece of chunky jewelry which is
something that you can find in a flea
market or an antique shop or get even at
like Topshop remember I thank you it
needs me I'm coming to
and showing us there's some of your bits
and how you can upgrade them really nice
to meet you I don't know if you have any
tips or anything that you want to leave
with our viewers just like it did a
secret tip that you're loving this
summer yeah I mean I think with fashion
it just has to express your personality
so don't necessarily you know follow all
the rules and don't be afraid to step
out of the boundaries but just obviously
wear what you feel comfortable and
confident in and hopefully I can help
along the way but at the end you always
have to put your stamp on it so bye guys
