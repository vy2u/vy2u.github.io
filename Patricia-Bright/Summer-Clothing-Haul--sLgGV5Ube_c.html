a whole video like the Sun has been
shining the weather's been getting
warmer and I'm really trying to add
color to my wardrobe and I'm wearing
black right now but you guys know I love
wearing black and white and I'm trying
to inject some color into it not just
because it's summer I just feel like
it's just nice to wear color when I work
on it or what it's just like it kind of
lights up the atmosphere of us is
wearing a grey suit or something like
that so I have a whole video which is a
really really bright haul for me and
recently I've been trying to wear more
color maybe I'm slightly failing because
my past few days have not had that much
you know of a good response but you know
what you don't know unless you try it so
for me I'm just trying out colors trying
to be a bit more experimental and let's
just see how it goes someone says her
stares changed a lot since you got
married no no really I'm just trying I'm
just trying to do more like sometimes
you just get bored of the same thing of
it that's all my hair is different my
the same wave the same look the same
makeup the same this let's just try it
something different and that's maybe I'm
gonna call this to try something
different the whole because um I'm just
not like this isn't normal for me like
color and stuff so let's decide so first
of all I bought some skinny jeans these
are the Lee jeans which is from Topshop
and they're like in an orange basically
Orange and I like these because they're
like free quarter lips they're kind of
cropped I love love love cropped jeans
and I went mad with like buying jeans
and stuff like that because I like jeans
and I think I was a high loft I love
Instagram follow me a comment stick
around I'll put the links below to my
facebook my Twitter and all that stuff
down below but um some head like jeans
on and that color as I said oh that
looks so good so yeah jeans have become
a new thing for me they're like kind of
high on the waist and these you know
they do quite a lot for them the
derriere of it so I like this I bought
another pair of jeans they're kind of
like a grey grey blue from Topshop is
what are their the Janie jeans and
therefore their high waist but we'll see
how those go I really like them but I
bought some alternatives that are just
amazing from Dorothy Perkins I'll show
you them shortly
then I brought
like I don't know what kind it's gonna
look on the camera but this is like a
pinky coral color that kind of crochet
jumper swingy it isn't a size 12 like a
UK size 12 but I don't mind buying
clothes I'd like two sizes bigger
because it can kind of just let hang off
and stuff so I bought that is what I'll
which is like a coral color so you can
see I'm getting excited but my color
palettes are often the same I've been
wearing green I don't think green suits
me like neon green anyway but we'll see
how it goes but Pink's and beiges I know
suit me but I'm not wearing any more
beige as well so I also bought these
shoes those of you who follow me on my
Instagram you would have seen them but
I'm not sharing my shoe size you guys
know self-conscious about that
I don't not really and they've got
leopard print and bows and everything no
not like a print cheetah print so cute
they look really cute and you guys saw
my other kind of Topshop ones I'm kind
of loving this shape and everything
there were 42 pounds but they were on
sale for 25 pounds so I got those and
then also on sale I bought these kind of
orange suede pumps but I don't know how
much I like these to be honest like how
much are they were they 50 pounds I
think there were 30 pounds actually on
sale but they're really comfortable and
I think they look lovely with a pair of
skinny jeans I might do some outfits if
you think I should do some outfits let
me know leave a comment below in order
videos so Dorothy Perkins is stepping
their game up all right I'm just
surprised like they have these really
skinny jeans and I bought a pair in
black but I did buy a pair in like dark
blue but I don't know whether I've worn
them somewhere they're amazing these
fits so well like they've got a bit of
stretching them everything and then
we're fairly nice they're super skinny
and you can get them in short regular
long and because I always like my genius
to kind of stop just at my ankles like
go tight all the way to my ankle
these oh my gosh these are the one I
made were just there were 25 pounds and
if you've got student discount you can
get to discard and there was a time but
they had 25% off so you can get two
pairs of jeans for the same price as
Topshop jeans so I was just loving these
I'm gonna go get
the pair so you can see what they look
like in the blue I hope you can
hopefully see how blue these are but
this is the blue pair and they're just
skinny all the way to the ankle not kind
of all ruffled at the ankle no they come
up perfectly on the ankle I love those
and then sticking with the color I
bought like a silver top and I'd never
wear sober because I feel like it looks
a bit icy on me like silver clothes like
it looks a bit icy but I think this is
nice like a little vest for summer what
would have been nice if it was a
racerback okay so I got fully hyped here
with flowers and colors and I don't know
what I was thinking or smoking or
something but this shut so this is when
Prime work yeah this is from Primark
this jar it's kind of a crop I'm gonna
stand up it's like a cropped swinging PC
like a Sweeny top and pink with flowers
and everything Michael hates it he says
it looks like in Hawaiian Hawaiian shirt
now what's wrong with a Hawaiian shirt
they're all the rage darlings I got that
and I love the fact that is kind of like
really wide sleeves that would look
lovely with jeans as well okay so
inspiration from fashion for nah I
bought these before I'd seen fashion
filth hey Lexi fellow bride one bride to
be and she has a pair of lifelong
charles's and I bought these I think I
bought them before and I saw the
pictures right yes
these are definitely really nice so I
bought these full trousers from whatever
buy them from Zara
no these are from Primark but they're
like oh but they're skinny as well at
the ankles so I haven't actually tried
them on I hate trying on god I hate
trying on clothes in shops I just buy
those and stuff and then I decide what I
want or not but I'm not trying these on
yet but I think they're gonna be lovely
and you guys saw this top right in
probably in my most recent I did a video
in it and this is from Primark and it's
like err Coulomb what you call it pilum
plumb the loom loom bottom and it's like
a neon green and I like this top people
like though it's horrible I don't hang I
really like this but you guys have made
me take my mind slide
okay so from primer these are all from
primark so I also bought a high-low
dress in green you guys can I went wild
with color I didn't I just just sick man
a high-low dress is it a high-low dress
no so I'm having a dress away they had
high-low dresses but it's kind of silky
Shivani dress in like a minty green from
primo Shay primal again then it's got a
silver belt so we'll see how I think of
that and finally I've got a few bits in
river island remember island is a shop
that I go into rarely because I just
find them a bit marketed but it all
depends you know it's hit or miss
sometimes bins I went in and I was oh
that's lovely
so yeah this skull vest thingy I don't
like wearing skulls right because I
always feel like what's the point of
wearing something that represents death
but I just thought no this has got
flowers in it so it's got life in me as
well so yeah and it's pretty isn't it
again it's kind of that kind of t-shirt
type shape it's cute it's cool I think
it's lovely
and then I got completely excited and
like weird with this final piece which
is this one here Mike what was I
thinking
hey I don't know if I hate it I don't
know even have to try it on with like
more stuff of mine and see what I
actually think of it so whoa
I feel floor excellent so we'll see you
about this yeah so guys that is my
spectacular and sprint nun summer haul
and full of colors how does it make you
feel that you make you feel the way like
even looking at this pile of clothes it
makes me feel like uh-huh I'm quite nice
