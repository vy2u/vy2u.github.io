a whole video like the Sun has been
shining the weather's been getting
warmer and I'm really trying to add
color to my wardrobe and i'm wearing
black right now but you guys know I love
wearing black and white and I'm trying
to inject some color into it not just
because it's summer I just feel like
it's just nice to wear Carla when I work
on it or what it's just like it kind of
lights up the atmosphere verse is
wearing a gray suit or something like
that so I have a whole video which is a
really really bright whore for me and
recently I've been trying to burn more
color maybe I'm slightly failing because
my past few days have not had that much
you know of a good response but you know
what you don't know unless you try it so
for me I'm just trying out colors trying
to be a bit more experimental and let's
just see how it goes someone said her
stairs changed a lot since you got
married no not really I'm just trying
I'm just trying to do more like
sometimes you just get bored of the same
thing of it that's all I my hair is
different my the same way the same look
the same make up for saying this let's
just try it something different and
that's maybe I'm gonna call this to try
something different whore because and
I'm just not I like this isn't normal
for me like color and stuff so let's get
size so first of all I bought some
skinny jeans these are the Lee jeans
which are from Topshop and they're like
in an orange basically orange and I like
these because they're like free quarter
lips they're kind of cropped I love love
love crop jeans and I went mad with like
buying jeans and stuff like that because
I like jeans and I think I was i left i
love instagram following me I've got my
Instagram I'll put the links below to my
face what my Twitter and all that stuff
down below but um something like jeans
on and that colors I said oh that looks
so good so yeah and jeans have become a
new thing for me they're like kind of
high on the waist and these you know
they did quite a lot for the the dairy
year of it so I like this I bought
another pair of jeans they're kind of
like her a gray gray-blue from Topshop
is what are their the Jamie jeans and
therefore their high waist but we'll see
how those go I really like their but I
bought some alternatives that are just
amazing from dorothy perkins i'll show
you them shortly then I brought
like I don't know what Kyle it's gonna
look on the camera but this is like a
pinky coral color right kind of crochet
jumper swingy it isn't a size 12 like a
UK size 12 but I don't mind buying
clothes are like two sizes bigger
because it can kind of just let hang off
and stuff so I bought that is what all
which is in like a coral color so you
can see I'm getting excited but my color
palettes are often the same i've been
wearing green I don't think green suits
me like neon green anyway but we'll see
how it goes but pinks and beiges I know
suit me but I'm not wearing any more
beige as well but i also bought these
shoes those of you who follow me on my
instagram you would have seen them I
don't like sharing my shoe size you guys
know self-conscious about that I don't
not really and they've got leopard print
and bows and everything no not leopard
print cheetah print so cute they look
really cute and you guys all my other
kind of top shot 1 i'm kind of love in
this shape and everything there were 42
pounds but they were on sale for 25
pounds so i got those and then also on
so i bought these kind of orange suede
pumps but i don't know how much i like
these to be honest like how much are
they were they 50 pounds i think there
were 30 patterns actually on cell but
they're really comfortable and I think
they look lovely with a pair of skinny
jeans I might do some outfits if you
think I should do some outfits let me
know leave a comment below in order
videos so Dorothy Perkins is stepping
their game art right I'm just surprised
like they have these really skinny jeans
and I bought a pair in black but I did
buy a pair in like dark blue but I don't
know whether I've worn them somewhere
they're amazing these fits so well like
they've got a bit of stretching them
everything and then we're fairly nice
they're super skinny and you can get
them in short regular long and because I
I always liked my genius to kind of stop
just at my ankles like go tight all the
way to my ankle these oh my gosh these
are the one I made were just there were
25 pounds and if you've got student
discount you can get to discard and
there was a time but they had
twenty-five percent off so you can get
two pairs of jeans for the same price as
topshop jeans so I was just another
knees I'm gonna go get
the pair so you can see they look like
in the blue I hope you can hopefully see
how blue these are but this is the blue
pair and they're just skinny all the way
to the ankle not kind of all ruffled at
the ankle know they come up perfectly on
the ankle I love that and then sticking
with the color i bought like a silver
top and I never wear so because I feel
like it looks a bit icy on me like
silver clothes it looks a bit icy but I
think this is nice like a little vest
for summer what would have been nice if
it was a racerback okay so I got fully
height here with flowers and colors and
I don't know what I was thinking or
smoking or something but this shirt so
this is from Primark yeah this is some
primer this jet it's kind of a crop
understand up sucka cropped swinging pc
like a swingy top and pink with flowers
and everything Michael hates it he says
it looks like in Hawaiian Hawaiian shirt
now what's wrong with a Hawaiian shirt
they're all the rage darlings I got that
and I love the fact that is kind of like
really wide sleeves that would look
lovely with jeans as well okay so
inspiration from fashion for not i
bought these before I'd seen fashion
filth hey Lexi fellow bride one bride to
be and she has a pair of lifelong
Charles's and I bought these I think I
bought them before and that's all a
bitch I'm right yes these are definitely
really nice so I bought these for
trousers from whatever them from sorrow
not these are from Primark but they're
like Johnson but they're skinny as well
at the ankle so I haven't actually tried
them on I hate trying on god I hate
trying on clothes in shopsite I just buy
those and stuff and then I decided what
I want or not but I'm not try these on
yet but I think they're gonna be lovely
and you guys saw this top right in
probably my most recent i did a video in
it and this is from Primark if you look
there and it's like a plum what you call
it pilum plum to loom loom bottom and
it's like a neon green and I like this
top people like those horrible I don't
hang I really like this what you guys
have made me take my mind
okay so from Prime off these are often
Primark so I also bought a high-low
dress in green you guys can I went wild
with color right didn't I just just sick
men and a high-low dress is it a
high-low dress notes on high low dress
away they had high low dresses but it's
kind of silky chiffon e dressing like a
minty green from premache prime or again
then it's got a silver belt so we'll see
how I think of that and finally and got
a few bits in river island remember
island is a shot but I go into really
because I just find them a bit marketing
but it all depends you know it's he's
hit or miss sometimes pin I went in and
I was all that's moly so yeah this skull
vest thingy I don't like wearing skulls
right because I always feel like what's
the point of wearing something that
represents death but i just thought no
this has got flowers in it so it's got
life in me as well so yeah and it's
pretty isn't it again it's kind of that
kind of t-shirt type shape it's cute
it's cool i think it's lovely and then i
got completely excited and like weird
with this final piece which is this one
here Mike what was I thinking what hey I
don't know if I hate it I don't even
have to try all of like more stuff of
mine and see what I actually think of it
so whoa I feel floor excellent so we'll
see you about this yeah so guys that is
my spectacular and sprite none
summerhall and full of colors how's it
makes you feel that you make you feel
away like even looking at this pile of
clothes it makes me feel like oh I'm
