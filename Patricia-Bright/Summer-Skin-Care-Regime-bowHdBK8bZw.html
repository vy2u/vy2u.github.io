video is gonna be a summer skincare
routine video and not just on the
skincare almost just like my skincare
regime video cuz a lot of people have
hearts about this and want to know a bit
more about what I use on my face and my
skin kit so I'm gonna go through the
whole thing because I think I've never
sat down and Danni and it's been highly
highly requests look like the whole
cleansing my cleansing regime first
and I told you that guys about this
before this is what I use on my face
it's a product from skin their skin
clears I saw this in Boots and I've
always suffered i've got dry skin by
suffer from really large pores on my
nose and just around my mouth i'm not
around enough but just here I always
have pause and this is so gross this is
so gross guys what we spend ages kind of
like it kind of weeds so I started using
this and I gave myself
dry skin and I fought this for oily skin
and I knew that I had glycolic acid in
it and what I know about glycolic acid
is that it is a an exfoliant a chemical
exfoliant so what it does is it causes
your skin to kind of the old dead cells
to kind of come off and you know kind of
just lets out your new skin cells and
what I found with this site what your if
you find it is a definitely kind of
makes your skin look brighter if you use
it about free free debt free times
you're noticed your skin looks
significantly brighter because it kind
of waxes off that lay offs and I use
that probably two or three times a week
so don't use it every day the powerful
thing in there is the glycolic acid and
this what I bought it was 10 pounds but
I hear now that it's gone back up to 20
pounds but to be honest it so that's
what I used to cleanse my face every
other day or to bake two days in between
and I didn't show it but I've got a
little puffy thing and maybe might show
in the side and I use that together and
I let it sit
on my face for about you know five
minutes to really lay work and I
definitely am kind of always roughing
this nose of mine that gets on my nerves
yeah so that's what I do with that so
then I would then on normal days I will
just use simple but if I if I for
instance haven't worn any makeup or
anything and I've used that the dank
before the day before I will just wash
my face with water rather than putting
soaps and if there's nothing for me to
cleanse off my face I'm not going to use
something but if I have maybe we'll make
up the day before or something like that
then I'll go ahead and use a simple
product and I don't necessarily always
use the exfoliating one but I just maybe
use the little one for dry skin but this
is the only one I've got at the moment
so I'm just using that it's really like
really easy and I quite quite like the
products as well after I wear makeup I
use the simple products as well for room
to work my makeup off and then but
usually you know makeup I don't really
ever get it off that low and that's what
I would have used the cleanser probably
the day after or the same night or
something so that is my cleansing
routine so what I usually moisturize
with if I told you that I jeez I'm
Vaseline but I can't use Vaseline in the
summer and because it's a bit too greasy
or 45 or aqueous cream so this is a
really generic brand and if anybody
knows anything about I do know this
stuff about how products are made
what you have is water and what you have
are oil most moisturizers are a
combination of water and oil and they
use something to make water and oil mix
because they don't naturally mix and I
know that a Coast cream is like the most
basic form of this water and oil mix I
remember in school in their science
class we actually made we made
moisturizers using beeswax in real time
this is like the most basic form but
I'll show you the consistency it's
really not any moisturizing but I
wouldn't use this on my body because it
doesn't more moisturize my body enough
but it's okay on my face cuz it's quite
like 'if 45 is a bit
given this and just saying what I enjoy
adding to my regime is SPF this has been
like where when sunblock has changed my
skin and I would advise anybody black
white asian whatever to wear sun block
it is the one and yes I use this I
bought this when I was in Mauritius
because I don't know I wouldn't matter
there I just look disgusting him ever
since I might show you I'll show you a
few wedding but but wedding honeymoon
pictures I just look crusty yeah the Sun
burnt me and then I was like okay fine
SPF 50 so I got this it's called some
care experts but again I know that Skin
Clinic have a really good UVA UVB filter
and I use really high a high 150 I don't
care I used fifty now the things you
will find with these um as their fifties
and things I've got high UVA and UVB
filters you will look blue it makes you
look blue you have you have to put
makeup over it and also not limp or
thing is with sunblock you don't rub it
in its meta form like a seal over your
face and they can be quite greasy but
this one isn't very greasy eat but you
again that's why it's gonna be really
important to cleanse a lot and you know
because I have that blue hue I have to
work on Cielo just like me over it just
to kind of make my face look like a
normal color again but this is the best
way to not have dark marks the best way
just to protect your skin from the Sun
to not get wrinkles so is anything else
I need to show you know that's it that
is my so it's really really simple more
or less that's what I do I have if you
want to know I have combination skin or
quite dry like around here and stuff and
my eyes I always have really dry skin
around my eye in the stuff and that's
why I have to I you Vaseline I watching
Vaseline
kind of resolves it I'm okay no it's
kind of seasons hit miss and then this
is we're all here and stuff is where I
get loads of BlogPaws but using that has
helped me oh and I did I do do that
brightening treatment but it's a 10 day
treatment but I don't do it constantly
it's like you know if for like your skin
just looks great
it just looks dry and just not glowy
that literally resurfaces your face if
you have an event to go to a wedding
it's your wedding a party and award
shows I mean you want to look glam and
glorious that's how to do it literally
the celebrities have been doing it for
years
dermatologists have known about this
stuff for years vitamin C is cheap
all right guys coach enjoy that bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
