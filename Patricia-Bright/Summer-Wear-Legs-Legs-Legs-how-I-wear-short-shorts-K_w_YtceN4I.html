the sunshine and I'm one of those people
who gets really excited when the Sun
comes out so I thought I'll show you a
few different ways that I like to wear
shorts this first pair are kind of
bluish chiffon in I think they're
perfect for the summer because they're
just so free and easy to wear
wearing it with a white blazer with like
gold accessories I think why it's so
gorgeous in the Sun but it's so
reflective and just sadly you also think
it's okay to go for bold patterns and
bright styles it's summer so enjoy
so my next look is so Daisy juice I've
got the denim I've got the kite and I've
got the boots on and I love ombre shorts
these are from stars of Viacom I just
absolutely love this look here there's
something about denim shorts that I just
absolutely love I think we see everybody
they remind me of summer festivals and
just feeling truly laid back
and finding me if my learner's shorts
they absolutely love them they look so
hard so for some weights and I suggest
paired with a really soft gurney color
just to kind of don't know just make it
more summery so guys that's the end let
me know which one is your favorite you
would get em leather or chiffon papal
girl thanks for watching and have a look
at my links below I'll be live on
conduit tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
