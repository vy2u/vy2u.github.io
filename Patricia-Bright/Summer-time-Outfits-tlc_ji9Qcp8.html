I don't know what it is I'm just feeling
slightly buzzed in like excited and
happy yes they're roomy down because
like it's a long story under in a vlog
but no today I'm in a great mood so I'm
doing a video on key pieces I think are
great for summer and I think that just
live a few of these bits and bobs you
can add them into your wardrobe and have
a perfect summer wardrobe and it's just
a little way to upgrade from spring to
summer all my links are down below
people always up to find me on Facebook
and Instagram and Twitter you can find
me down below where I'm always talking
ok so let's get started with this video
so the first key piece is definitely the
maxi skirt why the maxi skirt because
we're all dressing fairly skimpy in the
summer because it's really hot but the
maxi skirt is really flowing and airy
and if you've got like a really small
top on but you put on a Mac see all of a
sudden look at again
so next has to be Prince Prince you know
you can add that flare of color into
your wardrobe in summer and i love aztec
print i love aztec print i love it and
these is a one piece which i also think
is a trend for summer but i'm not going
to talk about it this is a one piece
which is from motel and just look look
at that just look at that how does it
make you feel it looks field makes you
feel like going to a beach right now and
just modern E with a Sun Hat
you
so the next item is random when it's
like pieces of plastic basically perfect
I think that perspex is going to be it's
really kind of summary cuz its own
reflective and just like glorious and
plastic and stuff but I've seen loads of
perspex things I think are really really
cool and you can go from the accessories
well I think it's many as specimens you
don't really want to be wearing a
plastic dress I don't think that will be
very comfortable for summer another
perfect example is this bag that i
bought from from new look so definitely
perspex is the way to go for some are in
your accessories
for Footwear it's definitely got to be
comfortable we all love wearing wedges I
love wearing wedges I'm always wearing
wedges but I think sometimes it's okay
to man up just man up and wear some
plimsolls plimsolls are really cheap and
like easy to where I got these from
Azores and these are quite right right
but I also bought I've also got a pair
from fred perry converse advanced all
those kind of things are really nice and
really casual and breathable on your
foot for summer
a cropped top like this I think these
are lovely for some are that key pieces
looks perfect with a maxi skirt and I
think it could genuinely suit everyone I
always say this laughing all clothes and
do all figures shapes just depending on
how you wear it as long as you can kind
of hide a few of those love handles and
everything it'd be good to go in a mini
crop top
the floral hair accessories flowers in
her hair is just the term that always
comes up to me and I love the way they
look flowers in her hair accessories on
hair bands I've done in my barn i'll
show a picture I just think it's
absolutely perfect for this summer
finally it's got to be the statement
shorts so any kind of denim shorts
cut-offs that look a bit rough do them
yourself DIY shorts if you wanted to do
a DIY video or if I haven't done one
already leave a comment below I
definitely do one but you know anything
that's got a bit of extra to it not just
plain um playing them and these are from
Hichilema fitnah from the Eco collection
no fashion against a connection and you
know just these again first of all
perfect beach / bikini you're good to go
guys

summer if you want more videos from me
