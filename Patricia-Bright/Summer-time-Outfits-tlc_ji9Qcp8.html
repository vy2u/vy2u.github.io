I don't know what it is I'm just feeling
slightly buzzed and like excited and
happy yes they're roomy down because
like it's a long story under in a vlog
but no today I'm in a great mood so I'm
doing a video on key pieces I think are
great for summer and I think that just
with a few of these bits and bobs you
can add them into your wardrobe and have
a perfect summer wardrobe and it's just
a little way to upgrade from spring to
summer all my links are down below
people always apps to find me on
Facebook and Instagram and Twitter you
can find me down below where I'm always
talking okay so let's get started with
this video so the first key piece is
definitely the maxi skirt why the maxi
skirt because we're all dressing fairly
skimpy in the summer because it's really
hot but the maxi skirt is really flowy
and airy and if you've got like a really
small top on but you put on a maxi all
of a sudden look at again
so next has to be Prince Prince you know
you can add that flair of color into
your wardrobe in summer and I love Aztec
prints I love
Aztec print I love it and this is a
one-piece which I also think is a trend
for summer but I'm not going to talk
about it this is a one-piece which is
from Motel I just look look at that
just look at that how did it make you
feel it looks field makes you feel like
going to a beach right now and just
modern ooh with a Sun Hat
so the next item is random whether it's
like pieces of plastic basically
perspect I think that perspex
is gonna be it's really kind of summery
because it's so reflective and just like
glorious and that's the good stuff
but I've seen loads of first bit scenes
that I think are really really cool and
you can go from the accessories well I
think it's many as specimens you don't
really want to be wearing a plastic
dress I don't think that would be very
comfortable for summer
another perspex example is this bag that
I bought from from new look
so definitely perspex is the way to go
for some are in your accessories
for Footwear it's definitely got to be
comfortable we all love wearing wedges I
love wearing wedges I'm always wearing
wedges but I think sometimes it's okay
to man up just man up and wear some
plimsolls plimsolls are really cheap and
like easy to wear I got these from ASOS
and these are quite bright
right but I also bought I've also got a
pair from Fred Perry converse it's vans
all those kind of things are really nice
and really casual and breathable on your
foot for summer
a cropped top like this I think these
are lovely for some are that key pieces
looks perfect with the maxi skirt and I
think it could genuinely suit everyone I
always say this is I think all clothes
and Su all figures shapes just depending
on how you wear it as long as you can
kind of hide a few of those love handles
and everything you'll be good to go in a
mini crop top
the floral hair accessories flowers in
her hair is just the term that always
comes up to me and I love the way they
look
flowers in a hair accessories on hair
bands I've done it in my barn I'll show
a picture I just think it's absolutely
perfect for this
finally it's got to be the statement
shorts so any kind of denim shorts
cut-offs that look a bit rough do them
yourself DIY shorts if you wanted to do
a DIY video or if I haven't done one
already leave a comment below I
definitely will do one but you know
anything that's got a bit of extra to it
not just plain plain them and these are
from H&amp;amp;M I think they're from the Eko
collection no fashion against a
connection and you know just these again
first of all perfect Beach over bikini
you're good to go guys
so guys I hoped you enjoyed that video
and it gave you a few ideas of items for
summer if you want more videos from me
