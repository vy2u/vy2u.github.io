subscribers I now got over on didn't say
guys welcome to my channel I feel like
it's been ages since I sat down and done
a chatty video and I feel like I am kind
of not really used to sitting down at
the camera though it's not been that
long but yeah forgive me if I'm a little
bit funny today
but I wanted to do the video about the
glow-up and when I did my last video
which was about being the ugly friend
and mentioned the glow-up and so many
people has said to me that they're
waiting for a video about it and
explaining what it is and just you know
giving them that hope that one day
they're going to have their Cinderella
moment and glow up so basically growing
up in my opinion is when you've been
like an ugly duckling or whatever and
then you become the Swan I wanted to
give you guys some tips today on the
glow up and you know just you know
getting ready to enjoy that time when it
comes right so prior to the glow up you
have the opportunity to determine who's
in your life you know what I'm talking
about if you're not there yet you're not
you know they physically mentally
financially whatever you're not there
yet you realize that not a lot of people
want to be around you not a lot of
people want to be your best friend and
there are people who are far more
interesting and cool to be around but
that's okay because you get to choose
who's in your life you get to realize
that those who are with you on your low
times are the people who are going to be
with you during the good times lots of
people look at me and right now like no
you're the cutest couples girls you know
I all of all that kind of crazy stuff
right I am Telling You when we got
together number one Michael was like
pale is pale he's still pale he will
bald-headed right he was like super
corny which he still is to be completely
honest with you and he drove the most a
beat down car you've ever seen you can
hear the car before it arrived I
remember when we used to go out I didn't
even drive so I couldn't even be you
know critical or anything I had no cars
that any car was great but if we'll go
out I've let Michael don't drive past
the club we'll go down the side
Road and we would come and walk to the
club versus anybody seeing what car we
had or anything like that I was staying
in like student halls he was staying
with friends and then ended up staying
at his parents so at that age of
nineteen twenty we weren't all that and
a bag of chips right but today we are in
the position that we stuck with each
other despite our failings and this
despite the lack that we have we are
able to grow and develop ourselves
together the reality is that you get to
choose who you go on this journey with
and don't look for perfection right now
look for opportunity and potential for
growth number two if you haven't reached
to grow up it means that you have not
peaked too soon and I say this because I
remember the people who were like you
know the most hottest the most popular
the most smartest a lot of times I've
seen them now and I'm a bit like oh my
gosh not that there's anything wrong
with them but sometimes they're in not
the best situation not the best in the
physicality compared to their heyday of
being fifteen and sixteen some people
are able to blossom but you never want
to be someone who's you know so arrogant
as a prideful at the peak of your time
that you peak too soon and for those of
you who have not peaked or anything like
that you realize that your opportunity
will come and while you are in that
place of not being perfect
be humble allow your spirit to be humble
because when you do have the opportunity
to peak you want to continue to grow and
develop and not peak at 25 but peak at
40 or peak at 50 or peak at 60 when you
get much much older that you'll never
reach your peak because you continually
aim to be better than who you are today
another point is that where you
currently are is not always going to be
where you're going to be the truth of
the matter is that change is inevitable
it is part of the circle of life today
will never be the same as yesterday
yesterday will never be the same as
tomorrow change is inevitable therefore
it is up to you to decide how's your
change going to be are you going to have
your change to be for the better or you
can have the change to be for the work
you can
choose to think on things that are
negative or you can choose to think on
things and say things that are positive
and I are going to better your life you
can choose how you're going to spend the
time are you going to spend your time
eating that pizza and that croissant on
that scone or are you going to spend
your time eating you know a carrot and
blueberry and I'm not gonna lie to you
I'm not gonna act like I eat the carrot
in the blueberry because I like my scone
and I like my croissant and I like my
pizza but I understand the repercussions
of if I do it so there are times I
choose not to do that and choose to have
the thing that is going to better my
life the power is in your hand to make
the right choices so you can do that so
you want to have your glow-up
you need to put in the work and the
research don't assume that all of this
comes naturally and if I show you my old
videos I looked
daga daga that's all I can say I look
bad my editing was bad my videos were
bad it was just terrible and I might
even drop some insert of my videos where
I was just in embarrassing mess right I
don't usually do this because I don't
wear all that like face paint that
people wear because I'm one I'm probably
really rubbish at doing it and I don't
really have many places to go to rewrite
some peacock eyes it works well the
needle broke but works and I've still
got all the fabric that I bought the
whole those few months ago I'm still
going doing loads of things so I'll see
you guys soon and thanks for watching
okay however it shows that time research
and practice will get you to a place
where you are considered grown-up and if
there's the greatest gift that I could
ask for is to learn faster and to read
faster if you can learn and develop your
craft or what you want to be or how you
want to look and you can visualize it
put in the time put in that effort
you'll receive the glow up or receive
what it is that you want in life so
giving some of the tips that I've used
for my grow up and I'm so totally far
from girl but these things have helped
me so number one never be ashy okay for
me I
really ashy skin I just get dry so for
me I like to have a cup of lassen lean
there's nothing like Vaseline on the
elbows and on the hand but you know in
the middle of your hand is crusty like
mine would always be like that it's not
a good look and I'm still I still fell
I'm still imperfect but Vaseline is the
answer sort out the eyebrows for me I
research the eyebrow shapes that I like
and I've been working on it genuinely I
feel like eyebrows can make so much
difference to the way you look and I I
think this is genuinely like just body
hair in general sort up your body hair
and your body odor it's gonna be very
difficult for you to glow up if you
stink okay and I'm not being harsh just
smell your armpits up somebody to smell
you and tell you if they think you smell
a little bit and then all you need is do
tripping a tidy outfit I really love the
thought of having a uniform and I'm
trying to do that where I just wear
jeans and I just wear a top most times
and then if I want to vary it up I wear
a skirt in the road top or I wear a
dress and the more simple work outfits
are as long as they're clean they're
ironed and they're put together
you're gonna look good don't worry about
being extra fashionable and all that
good stuff just look clean and tidy
black white grey and blue will always be
your answer
practically and I mentioned this before
is read read read read or listen to an
audiobook or do some research if you
want to be a better you find out from
people how they've been the better
there's a guy on YouTube I absolutely
love his name is Tai Lopez and he reads
a book a day and I've been you know
watching his channel listen to some of
his recommendations and just realizing
the reality of hold on if you want to be
great learn from what the Great's are
already doing so yeah sorry guys I get
so you look emotional when I do videos
like this but I feel it in my heart but
I hope you guys found it useful and I'm
really excited to see your glow up and

that you're in right now where you don't
feel like you're that perfect leave your
