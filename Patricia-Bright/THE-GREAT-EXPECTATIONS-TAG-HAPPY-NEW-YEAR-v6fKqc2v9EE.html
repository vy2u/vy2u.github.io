and I don't know about you but I'm
really grateful to be here today and
just to be back into the new year and
I'm sorry that I sound very hoarse I've
been really unwell for the past few
weeks and i'm sure you can tell i've got
long hair again it didn't take me very
long i think it took me four weeks and I
was like it I want some hair extensions
again but that's just what I like but
whatever so I'm sure you guys have a
whole load of resolutions as do i and
one of them is to definitely try to
interact a little bit more online and do
tags like I've never created a tag and
this is going to be my first one so do
help me out with this guy's but also
just to do more as well to get for you
guys to get to know me more I felt like
you know a lot about them to be tiny on
it but I just have a bit more fun online
and to interact with the other youtubers
out there so I'm calling this tag the
Great Expectations tag and just being
that when I think of New Year's I think
of excitement and I really do have right
expectations for things to be absolutely
wonderful and grey and lots of growth to
happen so I've got some questions and
their beauty fashion and just general
life and questions and I say this is my
first tags and do bear with me so the
first question is what is the beauty bad
habit you want to remove from your
regime mine is definitely not taking off
my makeup at night and I know some
people might say that's gross but when
you're tired sometimes especially if
you've gone out you just hit that pillow
like to head down whatever and we wake
up we like makeup all over the pillow
and like this it's not all the time but
it's not fairly regularly so that is a
bad thing I'm really what to remove from
my regime
definitely try to get into that kind of
Knightly makeup removal process mmm as
part of my regime so what is the beauty
secret you want to add to your regime so
this is definitely not a secret and my
sake this always every year but it's to
add water and just sit drink a lot more
water I know it's really weird but I
don't like drinking water I don't like
the way it tastes I think it's really
boring and I more than apple juice drink
i'm addicted to apple juice but i'm
definitely going to try and carry it
around i can bought a liter of water of
me and just try to consume that and at
least in the day a little water a day so
that's what i want to add to my raging
the last year's favorite beauty product
I definitely have to say it's my
bioderma it's like a water cleanser and
when I do you know clean my face at
night after wearing makeup this is an
amazing option I love it I think that
really gives me really glowy skin and i
bought this when I was in Spain about
four months ago and I need to go to
somewhere else in Europe again so I can
buy another one I absolutely love this
product and I think I'd be my favorite
for 2013 you never know so a beauty goal
for this year the last year I definitely
if I can wanted to even out my skin tone
but I really feel like I'm looking a lot
more even now but I think my beauty
regime is more from a body perspective
so definitely trying to like tone up and
have really soft silky smooth skin like
all over like no Krusty knees or you hit
me back that there's to be absolutely
smooth and really really toned so it's
not really like face beauty but from a
body perspective I really just want to
get my abs and my arms into shape so if
you guys want to join me we're doing
some of that
you know we can work out together so
moving on to the fashion set of
questions I can't think of a specific
fashion mistake but what I can think of
is potentially kind of like just
overloading way too much color too much
texture just too much of everything and
I find that sometimes you can do
especially if its cold you know could
infer how to put the fur trim put on the
ugg boots put on everything and it's
just too much and I have definitely made
that mistake many times at colors
patterns textures just all in the one
outfit it's just way too much sometimes
so what do I think is going to be a
fashion trend for 2013 well don't really
know like friends on the whole but I'm
thinking for myself every day it's going
to be a lot more chic a lot more
streamline like I've been going through
my wardrobe and like chucking out so
we're not talking about giving to
charity but getting rid of a lot of junk
and just try to have really key simple
pieces lots of like straight lines and
just elegant Mike and easy just you just
throw your jacket top trousers you've
got you're ready to go so for me trend
is going to be like easy fashion that is
just good to go so this year's fashion
must-haves well for me it's definitely
got to be the boot like a nice Chelsea
high heel boot and I've already got one
I got these at Christmas and I just love
the way they look because it's really
cold here and boots are always the way
to go if you want to keep warm but you
also want to keep stylish so this is it
for me and also probably another key pr-
a tough one but and that one for me
would definitely be sure
it's like a classic pair of prada courts
that's really why I want so fingers
crossed I can get this one up then the
next step of questions are all about
life and more general stuff I'm sure you
guys know that I would say this but it
would definitely be getting married and
not necessarily the ceremony because I
actually some of you guys might not know
but we did a registry office it was like
10 people there 10 20 people and that
was for the legal signing and then a
week later we did like a big mass of
ceremony but I really feel like that
small registry office was like the
highlight of my year and like my biggest
achievement was salucci put pen to paper
and you know it well enough away to my
husband no joking that's what I did but
yeah that was a big achievement for me
last year I think I faced um questioning
sounds really weird but I really feel
like I face questioning my faith in
terms of not wanting to believe or
anything like that but when sometimes
things are all going wrong so I lost my
job and prior to that and like this was
before trying to get house Mary there
was like I haven't got a job but it was
just like oh my gosh things are so up in
here and usually where things are up in
the air i'm usually quite you know Kourt
can kind of roll with it but i really
didn't feel like I was rolling with it
last year I feel like when challenges
came I was very very shaken so I found
that quite hard that I wasn't as actors
dealing with like bad things as usual
but I'm hoping that this year that will
not be the case and whatever comes my
way I would just roll the punches for me
it's definitely got to be about
investing them fun and I'm talking about
my time with money my energy my thoughts
and just having fun and being freed the
young sometimes I find that I can be
very very stuffy and I like I'm focused
man I'm really focus I'm getting things
done and sometimes I just don't put any
time aside to just have fun and joy so
I'm going away and go to Thailand going
to Africa as should be going to
somewhere in Europe and potentially
Brazil so and excited about you know
using all my money on her traveling the
world and having fun obviously I'm not
like a specialist though I'm really not
that old what might would definitely be
to enjoy life but life is long so don't
worry or sweat when things don't like
work out you know there's like 70 years
or if not 80 years some people are 90
years so you've got a long time to make
a lot of mistakes but achieve a lot of
amazing things so don't worry if you
make a mistake and this goes well
whether this goes wrong don't worry
you've got time to resolve it unless
you're right 98 then you might be
dieting but you know that's fine you
know resolve it in the last breath that
you have so guys that is my great
expectations tag and again as I said
it's my first time so I actually wanted
to write the names of the people that I
wanted to tag and but anyone is am free

really want to know a bit more about
