hey guys so today it's going to be one
of my first new videos based on the fact
that one I like to talk to I did got
problems that was really really popular
and three I just wanted to carry it on
and see ways that I can kind of help or
have a bit of fun on this channel to you
guys who are watching this is going to
be the first I think I'm going to call
it motivational moments correcting
that's right mmm you know it's easy to
hashtags kind of me so yeah this is
gonna be my first one and today's topic
is going to be on living of guys now
that I have lived with a guy for just
over a year and I felt like there's some
tips that I want to give some of you
ladies out there you weren't quite there
yet
and may want to be prepared for that
kind of thing so that's what today's
motivational women is going to be about
and I say get comfortable I always say
this get a cup of tea I've got a copy
although it's very hot in here
and let's get motivated so number one do
not expect gourmet dinner on a regular
basis what you'll learn when you live
with a guy they kind of got that forager
hunter-gatherer attitude you know
there's no qualms and anything and
everything is food you might ask what's
for dinner but actually everything oh
there's popcorn in the cupboard oh we've
got some bread there oh I think there's
a tin of hotdogs we've got some biscuits
I'm sure we can rustle something
together and my face is like when is the
Vice where is the veg place to meet like
I need to have a proper meal you will
learn living with a guy that anything
and everything is actually dinner so for
those of you who are like weird with
hygiene and stuff like that you might
not like this bit but your toothbrush
may no longer be your own I have been
very specific that my toothbrush is the
purple toothbrush your toothbrush is the
green toothbrush however there were
warnings that I wake up and I feel
my toothbrush the purple toothbrush is
wet because that means that someone has
not taken the time to assess the
toothbrush situation and he's used my
toothbrush and this is not one occasion
I think it's actually done on purpose
you risk being wounded when living with
a guy and not purposefully to be totally
honest with you you know he might toss
and turn in his sleep and you might end
up being whacked in the face on one of
those left turn so you might want to
wear padding to bed or something and
just protect yourself and maybe well
appear in between yourself on those
knife men are often a lot bigger than
women and probably they're a little bit
you know less coordinated than some of
us I'm not pointing any fingers
everything is fine if you as a girl want
a concrete genuine opinion on multiple
things you like the closest that you
might have to call my mum because a guy
will say everything is fine you want a a
concrete critique opinion on the outfit
looks fine from the pillows yeah they
look great
hmm you want a concrete opinion on what
paint to buy and that's fine everything
is fine and I love that like by asking
what's this like and just getting the
same response all the time your
cupboards will be empty you'll buy you
know that new packet of biscuits I don't
know if you have that it's like it might
be for me it's malted milk I know that
sounds gross but for me it's like a
Burma packet of malted milk and I put
them in the special you know biscuit tin
place you come back crumbs is also
that's left you buy something you it's
gone every single time it's gone no you
know you're saving it for that special
occasion when you're going to get comfy
on the sofa I just dip your molten milk
into your cup of tea and then they're
gone yeah you can have a lot of moments
like that goes
when you live with a guy and you eat
with a guy you learn to eat very very
fast the reason being is that he eats
extremely fast more than likely and by
the time he's done with his plate your
plate looks like the most appetizing
thing ever and if you're not quick with
it that food will be snatched you will
never be lonely by force you're living
with someone they have to be your friend
you'll learn to communicate with things
that are more than words so a noise like
a granite hook or a sound even a look is
enough to tell a story when you've lived
with someone for long enough you will
begin having great nights in where you
might play a staring contest and these
become official games of tournaments and
levels and championships and awards at
the very end and you will be competitive
when it comes to those things so guys I
hope you enjoyed that video as a little
bit of fun I will be doing more
