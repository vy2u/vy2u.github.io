wanted to have a little fun and have a
little kind of like story time I plan on
doing these regularly and I know that I
have mentioned doing certain videos and
like for like college and school and
stuff like that all of that is going to
be coming I'm uploading more regularly
but I felt like I wanted to start off
this kind of story time with a little
bit of a bang and this is a story that I
thought like I wanted to tell you guys
about it for quite a long time because
it happened over two years ago but I was
always quite embarrassed and thinking
I'm the stupidest girl ever for doing
what I did but I'm going to tell this
story because you know we just got to be
honest with each other once in a while
you know and it is quite a funny story
now that I look back on it I would never
recommend or advise anyone to do
anything that I did but basically I'm
sharing the time where I was died and
was kidnapped abroad completely my fault
to an extent but you know when you're
away abroad sometimes you do some silly
things right okay so you know get a cup
of tea get copper Dubrow I'm gonna tell
you the whole story so this all happened
with me and a friend of mine we decided
to make a trip to Malaysia Singapore and
barley we went and spent I think I was
like two to three weeks we just like
let's go you know backpacking in Asia
and I actually filmed like it long
before it's like bigger on YouTube I
kinda did a like a vlog of the time and
I think you might be able to find it so
I look absolutely awful terrible there
so yeah we decided to go to like Asia
it's just me and my friend and she's
done a lot of traveling before but I
hadn't been much of a traveler and the
kind of person who I am is that when I'm
away I'm ready I don't like vac why not
wait but but one like did you get drunk
and like being extremely Larry and stuff
but I'm like everyone's best friend
I just don't start talking to random
people and I'm like very very trusting
and so we were in Malaysia and it was
just the most amazing place we have the
most amazing parties and and there's a
market
time you went to and then we happen to
like be walking in this market and it
was really really nice and then we
spotted some kind of like guys who like
you know it's like they spotted us he
spotted them like clearly we all knew
that you know we're all foreigners and
that maybe we were like Londoners and
stuff like that so we found out that the
guys they weren't actually Londoners but
you know they've been to London a lot
and like they were you know they weren't
native and they were expats because
there's loads of expats in blasier like
how can you tell us where the good
places are to go to and stuff like
they're like yeah meet up with us later
the guy gave me like a mobile phone like
he had a spare mobile phone he gave me a
mobile phone and he is likely three of
his friends who all seemed really nice
and I was on my phone obviously gave us
some mobile friends that will call you
on this later whatever
we'll go for lunch we'll go for dinner
we'll go to a couple of parties and all
that kind of good thing and we my friend
won like very excited that yeah we got
some friends hey we're gonna try
something different now when you're
travelling that kind of thing is normal
because I've met some amazing people
when I've gone traveling and you know
you go to their hand become really
familiar and it's like you know each
other you're good friends cuz you're all
from and you're all kind of in the same
experience so I kind of thought that it
was the same with these guys anyway so
when we went up with the guys who nice
need to start with and they had been
drinking quite a bit we went out to go
and let e and this really I can't
remember the place it's like this more
but it's like amazing where you have
shisha of food and it was just a lush
and they took us to this hotel penthouse
party and supposedly it's like one of
the best hotels in that Malaysia like it
was a rooftop and as a pool and I was
like all foreigners and lots of
glamorous women it was it was you know
fresh you know you go to party you're
like oh okay is this kind of party so it
was a very very glamorous and really
really nice and so we partied a lot and
then the guys we could tell we're
getting quite drunk at this point in
time they were getting quite drunk but
they had driven us to this location and
that's not trying to even think about
how we're getting home where are we
we're like yeah
come on yeah yeah you know we all get
Alerian you know carried away to an
extent again I would not advise anyone
to do this so we are all right this this
rooftop party with the pool and the and
it was good we were having a great time
and there are other people that we're
their meeting and stuff like that but
these guys are obviously our like hosts
and you know there's lots of people then
say oh no we should go to this other
place it's even better they've got
amazing parties it's super underground
it's super Street super cool and they
were like telling us about this thing a
little bit Latin especially because the
guys were already very drunk and I was a
bit like mmm but who's driving us there
you got a drug his anger that's fine
and so now we get into the car and said
yeah we're going to this really cool
party then another guy that ended up
coming like in the car and stuff with us
right and so there's like me my friend
in the back the two guys at the front
and the guy who ends up driving is the
guy who's like the drunkest out of all
the guys I mean my friend kind of like
groan oh my gosh only side if you're
like maybe this isn't gonna be a good
idea because they're extremely drunk and
we're in Malaysia at the end of the day
it's not like we're in London we don't
have our mobile phones and if you ain't
got no one to call like that you're in
the middle of nowhere now now we start
driving you
what do you suddenly say how far oh yes
no it's coming up soon it's coming up
soon me 20 minutes you know how far are
we we go out of we go out of the main
city of Malaysia
we're now on motorway now we're on where
you have toll crossing you know where
the tolls up and then my heart starts to
sink and thing ain't no party out here
in the middle of nowhere got this drunk
guy driving his friend who's convincing
us that they know where they're going or
that you know this party is definitely
going to be the most amazing thing but
meantime I'm seeing the city lights
disappearing behind me and I'm seeing
like bush and all kinds of
lands in front of me and then I go oh my
gosh I get so scared and I pop a panic
and I'm like oh my gosh
so the next thing like the next toll I
just jump out the car because we went
past like two or three times I was like
I'm getting out the car and I was like
can someone help us and I'm I'm not even
lying to you yeah the people at the
tolls just looked at me and my friend
like we were just some pieces of dirt
the images that ain't none of my
business
the visitors gave us that look like we
can't do nothing for you sorry no no no
not bigoted English we were like oh my
gosh and we're just out in the middle of
nowhere where no one was willing to help
us or anything like that and then that
this guy is racing and they're they
think it's funny and me and my friend
are like literally panicking with that
no just let us go we just want to go
home now
now that no no I'm not going we're not
going home we've come out all this way
we're going to this pie is that no we
just want to go home and the guys were
just not having it and I was this like I
started panicking so being the ingenious
person that I happen to be I was like
girl we need to do something so then I
was like what we need them to get us to
stop somewhere well we can get some help
or where we can at least get a taxi and
go or something like that so then so
this is so bad right
my dad actually has the type 1 diabetes
right so sometimes he has what is called
a hypoglycemic attack which is where he
kind of loses consciousness and because
of that I seen that and so I was just
like I'm gonna fake having it but could
I see him again let's start it going
like I'm never gonna shave I said like
making noises he being a like doing this
in the back of the car and then and then
my friend was like oh she's having she's
having a fear she needs to get some
sugar all she needs is some sugar like a
might be no chocolate
we need to stop on something she's got
she's got diabetes she really needs some
help because I was the only thing
I could do I was like oh no did all
kinds of foolishness in the back because
I really just wanted them to just stop
the car say it like a petrol station
right and so I was like doing it she's
like no she really needs to get some
sugar I have you guys got any sugar got
my pen she got anything like that
they're like no we just go to the petrol
station blah blah blah so then I was
doing all this in the back and then they
decided to like stop at a petrol station
and then and yeah my friend was there
she was like no I just need to buy
somebody you know King and give her some
cash got some cash whatever please
believe as we rolled up right as we
rolled up iners I think the guy was
going to the shop right and taxi an
empty taxi was filling up at that gas
station yeah let me tell you that I
arose from that no I was like yeah
that's great
I took her hat are we dashed into that
taxi cab and I was like yeah and then
yeah we asked them to drive us back to
the main town and boy
we never saw those guys again or they
could see was the dust of our wheels
unknown yeah that was the silliest thing
I ever did
abroad and I know I'm laughing at it now
but at the time it was so scary and I
was thinking oh my god I'm in this
foreign land with these guys that I
don't know they could do anything we're
not in the main city no one around seems
to want to help us they're looking at us
that with some strange people and you
know we don't know anyone here so it's
really really dangerous and I was scared
for my life that I could be killed and
put in a bag or whatever and no one will
know to government to Malaysia and
disappeared
what so you know I like it's time to
fight for my life at this point in time
and I quit you let this not the time to
start doing stupid things like getting
into cars with random people especially
when they are very drunk and nobody
knows where you are
so that is my story time I hope you guys
found that a little bit funny I find it
funny like you know be living here I
think by the time he arrived back you
know in our hostel we kind of laughed
and was like oh my gosh that was saying
funny but I remember when I told like my
kin like my friend like that was so
dangerous and so stupid and as I said
yeah cat it was I'm going to try and do
these once in a while if I can find like
you know good storage of my past if
there's anything else you guys would
like to see that me nod I try not load
