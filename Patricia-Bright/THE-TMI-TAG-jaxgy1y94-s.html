favorites probably but why are me you're
gonna say the wire favorite band a block

call her like every day four times a day
annoyingly I missed my old friends I
miss my family that I don't see as much
as I wish I did favorite song could be
from him too - you know Lauren Hill Jose
Gonzales - Marlon Bob Marley so favorite
song is a really hard question
quality you look for in a partner
mine is I've got a couple of qualities
of humility in my quality big muscles
strong chin hope thing is key smart know
kind of the qualities I look for in the
individual are more from my nature
perspective so one thing I look for is
humility that's a really important thing
to me I don't like prideful men and
strength like a man you can get a man
you can like just keep going like I
don't like weak weaklings right be
strong your man be strong okay how do I
do this without being corny no one could
be corny we're not doing this together
okay
okay I would look for qualities I would
look someone who is very loving and
caring has good moral values a strong
personality isn't just swayed or swept
whichever way the wind blows woman who
can cook a nice dinner
my yellow you cheap I don't know I think
I covered it yeah I think you covered it
well thank you honey that's sweet that's
quite something a question now I'm glad
that we're doing it together
favorite quote oh I know what my
favorite quote is mine is life and death
is in the power of the tongue so speak
like a lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of a sheep
oh that's fun going getting a friend and
favorite actor this is an easy one
Leonardo DiCaprio
Leonardo is one of them and he's a bit
old but I really let coach Whitaker
favorite color my favorite color is blue
my blues are loud or loud music or soft
music mine is definitely soft music
depends on the mood but generally
probably loud I spend a lot of time at
sitting I have a really melancholic do
you think a Michael that what is it why
do you make anyone to let you to jump
out the window where do you go when
you're sad I know where you go where'd I
go I got to go back I gotta go to bed
bury yourself I normally go to my car
today how long does it take you to
shower you can take me anywhere between
you know three minutes if I'm washing
our words to like an hour say all
depends on what I'm doing where I'm
going but it is very it's not only a
river on the fluoride woods as well
full lake in the bathroom floor after
she's finished for me pretty great about
five minutes yeah very quick how long
does it take you to get ready in the
morning if I want to look good it's
going to take me an hour and 20 minutes
Oh an hour an hour that my face takes
half an hour to do properly properly on
normal day half an hour so a normal day
half an hour if you're getting decks
dressed up an hour yeah but I'm getting
dressed up dressed up in
and a half takes me to get ready about
twenty minutes half an hour I might do a
video on that morning routine you want
to see that bit coming down below in a
physical fight I have I was like the
Robin Hood but I thought I was a Robin
Hood it's trying to say say people and
someone ended up fighting me for trying
to stop them doing something to someone
else and I was really like I got really
emotionally involved it's a good this
are you this girl was being bullied like
people are throwing like it was a water
fight in there like throwing water at
her and she really didn't wanna I'm
gonna tell you this oh yeah she really
didn't want to get wet like my mom my
mom and I say just leave I will now just
leave her alone
and then the girls like running after
her and I did something stupid I put my
foot out to trip up the girl he was good
he was trying to throw water on her but
she fell to the ground is that what are
you doing then we had a fight and for me
you've been in a lot of physical fights
Michael don't even make that face look I
already got a troublemaker I've had a
couple of scraps but not anymore not
recently not last
not since I got married no not in the
last since we've been together turn on
this right here in German this is all I
need tell you tell me oh my physical
things I guess I don't know if it's
physical but um but my thighs or knees
I'm not physical I ain't like you know
the drawers out and things are hung and
everything is done I'm turned on I don't
know that I'm sure someone who does
choice yeah Amanda his what
you know I'm with the tool belt and pair
of overalls in the hammer oh yeah every
single woman and for me a turn-on
is a you know it sounds old-fashioned
you ever birth a woman who likes to look
make an effort to look after her man so
maybe like cooks a dinner or maybe like
wells dinner they know it's not the fact
that I don't think oh you're we moved
you to new place and all that but I
think it's nice to do something for
somebody that hasn't been asked for just
back out because you want it to do it
turn off they like what you say before
you don't like people who are too
prideful so too arrogant or too I'm
willing to look outside of their own
point of view please let's be honest
like and your other failure yeah and I
would have fell like I pushed myself
because I want to be the best that I can
be and I don't like to fail but fate is
a part of life don't afraid of rabid dog
I'm afraid oh oh I know I'm afraid up
when I swim and I feel something on my
foot that makes me scared last thing
that made you cry
