am finally doing the video about boys
and love a relationship I have been
meaning to do this for a really long
time I'm really sorry I haven't done it
yeah
I was literally overwhelmed at the
amount of questions that I got a victory
got like 700 questions so so many
questions from my email to my inbox to
my facebook literally everywhere and so
I was a bit like how am I gonna even
answer this I had no idea so what I've
done is I kind of grouped and categorize
the questions and I really want to
address them in like a really helpful
kind of fun way you know because some of
us are serious about finding that one or
the man or you know love relationship
goals I know it's not every day that you
have goals so I'm gonna try and be
helpful with this video so it's gonna be
maybe be long so get comfortable get a
cup of tea or coffee or a lot it
whatever you want okay because it's
about to get real so one of the many
questions I got was about being feeling
under appreciated in a relationship so
young man he isn't you know buying new
gears or taking you out or making feel
like a woman
you know when you just want your man to
make you feel like the lady in his life
and maybe he's got a little bit
comfortable with you maybe he's not as
romantic as he used to be or maybe he's
just a downright brute man who just
isn't being the guide you want him to be
and you're kind of unhappy with it so my
first piece of advice when it comes to
feeling underappreciated is cream unike
and communication is essential in any
relationship and when I say communicate
you have to set time aside like a
meeting let it be you know go for a
smoothie or something together somewhere
and have a talk and I always say don't
talk from a place of emotion I find with
guys if you're like extremely emotional
it like goes over their heads but if
you're quite logical you thought-out
they can't say oh you're just being a
girl you just being emotional hormonal
or whatever like that but if you take
your time to kind of build up and not an
argument or defense case but you know
the points you know write them down I
really
like I am slightly underappreciated and
I would really like if you could do this
for me more and where you communicate is
always important to do it in a super
loving way because men are a bit like
you know they get offended very very
easily so you have to do it in a way
that isn't like critical of them but
maybe it's highlighting the situation
that you're in and that you want it to
be improved
you need to drop some hints don't just
expect that a guy knows how to do that
like I don't think guys are the smartest
like there's sad to say they just don't
get certain things and they definitely
don't get women you need to drop some
hints and if hints ain't worked working
you need to make it absolutely clear
beat that you say that on Tuesday night
I want you to do something special for
me okay at least you've given him
something specific something definite
and a timeline for him to work toward I
know someone men like but I want him to
want to do something for me look don't
worry if he wants to or doesn't want to
he would do it because he loves you
sometimes guys just don't think about
being that extreme romantic so don't
worry about that if we need to write a
date in his diary special time with a
bail or something then you need to write
that into his diary and on Tuesday
morning just give it a little tap you
know say you're feeling under under
appreciated sometimes you need to show
appreciation you know what have you done
for him lately some relationships are
give-and-take and I know sometimes some
women get really worn out and really
tired of trying but you have to keep
going and I think the more you give a
guy love if he really loves you he'll
really try to learn and mold himself and
be a better man for a good woman like
yourself or good partner like yourself
finally this is the last result right
but you need to withhold the goodies
okay let somebody know what they're
missing I don't know what goodies you
are giving out but you know what I mean
about goodies sometimes you just need to
Blackwell no I'm not going to do that
for you well no I'm not going to go
there with you well no I'm not gonna you
know massage your feet tonight or
something I don't know sometimes you're
gonna withhold the goodies so they
really get to miss you and no really
that
have a good partner with them so the
next one is what do I do when I like a
guy who's no good for me girl we have
all been there before the bad boy he's
hot he's attractive he's got that little
bit of an edge with him leave the bad
boy alone and I'm not saying that bad
boys can't become good boy so I know
lots of bad boys who've become good boys
but realistically you really don't want
to mess with a bad boy but I know what
it's like I've been I've been the girl
who's liked a bad boy and I've had my
friends telling me oh no you can't like
him you can't like him and it literally
goes over my head until I'm like oh my
gosh I've realized you know that he was
so bad and all this kind of stuff for me
and I remember that my friend got so
tired of me after being like well why
are you with this guy when he treats you
this way why are you with this guy when
he does this and I remember being I
don't know every just you know sometimes
you're infatuated with someone but you
need to realize that dating a bad boy
can have a negative effect on your life
for me I was dating a guy who's quite a
difficult guy you know in my school days
and it really impacted on my grades I
really did make an impact on my grades
and I look back and I think damn it man
I really need to have kept focus so you
know for me to you that if you are
dating a bad boy and it's an important
time in your life you need to really
make sure that it's not going to impact
your future if you are going to date a
bad boy or you want to you know advise
someone who's dating a bad boy
understand that it is what it is don't
delude yourself and think that you can
change a guy you can't change a guy you
can't change men they choose to change
themselves you can kind of steer them in
a right direction but bad boys are
usually stubborn so if you decide to be
in that relationship or that situation
accept it for what it is okay and either
wrong with it or roll out of it and I
like the thought of hindsight
trust me think of that bad boy in five
years or in ten years and you're going
to have that look back situation like
gosh what was I doing with him trying to
think about that at this point in time
it's so funny when I like kind of look
back on maybe like guys who weren't that
nice to me because I was not treated
very nicely by like a
couple of particular guys and I'm just
like huh not hot but I'm in such a happy
place now so positive and I'm sure that
lots of these people would literally die
to be with me now which sounds really
arrogant but you know what I mean like
you know after they messed around for a
long time they're like I really wish I
had a good girl but they can't so think
of the hindsight of the time where that
person will eventually wish they could
have you you'll probably be in a lot
better place in your life the next
question is about being forever alone
never being on a date never having a
kiss never having a boyfriend never been
asked out honey don't worry about that
and I'm seeing girls write me this who
are actually quite young like you're
like sixteen or like thirteen or
something like that why who you kissing
where you kissing you need to kiss the
back of your hand about kissing I never
had like a proper boyfriend till I was
around probably around nineteen and
obviously I had maybe kissed guys before
them but nothing like extra serious
honestly it's never too late I know
girls who still single at 21 22 I'm very
focused on their career or themselves
and developing themselves from the
inside out you really do not have to
worry about being awkward or left out a
lot of people are talking the talk but
I'm not walking the walk and slower
steady wins the race you don't want to
be at 16 right 13 this has been your
boyfriend this is being a boyfriend this
has been your girlfriend you literally
have got a list as long as I don't know
this long of all the guys that you have
dated like you don't even want that so
take it slow you don't need to have 14
different boyfriends to realize what
makes a good partner for you trust me
and I think a lot of people end up
dating so much that they don't even know
how to like you know make a choice to be
with someone and stay with someone
because they're already moving on to the
next and I really think that's one of
the things that we've got modern-day
society kind of stress in it's like I
need today I need to try this one I need
to try like 18 different boys why like
that's a lot of penis like this
unnecessary now if you are worried about
you know having a lack of skill whatever
I wouldn't worry about it we are human
our biology works in a way
that there is like I don't know natural
muscle memory or something things will
do what they're meant to do when they're
meant to do it when you run the right
situation but if you're worried about
kissing and all that kind of stuff
YouTube has some great tutorials but
definitely if you are forever alone
don't worry you'll not be forever lone
and one thing is that if you feel like
you're ugly or you're unattractive then
you don't attract guys trust me the glow
up will happen if you guys know about
grow up grow up is really real I feel
like I'm a testament of Lytton Oh grow
up
if you guys watch my video and being the
ugly friend then you'll know where at
where I came from
No and I did a video about it and you
know what guys in France me but oh well
get on with it and focus on yourself
next question is how do I speak to my
crush so for those of you guys who feel
really shy and are very awkward when it
comes to speaking to guys
I completely understand it being a dweeb
or being a nerd or whatever or awkward
was totally my number one thing and I
went to a girls school as well so you
know I didn't know how to talk with guys
in that kind of like I like you kind of
way it just wasn't something I was able
to do like guys would have me as their
friends I'm definitely friends I was
friendzone Patricia like friendzone for
life and I didn't really know how to
like speak to guys like that sometimes
you need to just go in for the kill and
make that first approach I'm not saying
go up to him face-to-face like hi I
really like you like no don't be that
kind of crazy person but like you know
snapchat him send in a little sneaky
snap like oh there's some emoji on it
yeah those are a little ways that you
can start having a little bit of
flirting so that ends a great weight in
that let your crush know that you're
kind of into him snapchat is a great way
to do that I'll be honest with you
little text is here little tweets here
little subliminals
see if he catches on to it you know you
can know how to do it I contact in real
life is obviously a really great way for
a guy to know that you're into him kind
of given that stare and then that that
look away like stare and look away and
always smile as well if you've got
constant bitch phrase then it's going to
really be hard for guys
he can approach you and I know some of
us can't help our bitch face but you
know what sometimes you've got to
finally you guys guys latest you got to
feel the fear and do it anywhere no
matter how scared you feel you sometimes
got to just push yourself and put
yourself into that situation and it
might be the awkward hi I really like
you kind of thing and you never know the
worst thing that can happen is that he's
gonna say I'm not really into you but
guys shouldn't be that mean where
they're like idiot ugly whatever the
other but you know just you might say oh
that's so sweet
I ever be totally into you but you will
never know unless you try so my final
question is on can girls and guys be
friends and this is a really good one
and my answer is yes yes yes because a
lot of my closest friends are actually
guys and men that have been in my life
for quite a long time and however my
closest male friends like when I think
of them I see them kind of like brothers
any other thought other than being my
friend would feel a bit like incest so
this is a very awkward situation and I'm
not attracted up to any of my friends so
if there's a slight attraction or you
had a past relationship or he kind of
likes you it just doesn't work so my
male friends are usually uh-oh I think
most of them are in long-term
relationship and I don't got call my
girlfriend's like every night I like I'm
on the phone to let my guy friend I
think that's a little bit weird just
just in my opinion to really need to
rely on a guy so much your partner might
not feel comfortable with you you know
being set clothes or so needy to another
man when your partner's got you so you
have to respect your partner in that way
and only you will deep down truly know
if that friend is just a friend if
that's a friend that you fancy or there
could be feelings or something could
happen in that relationship dead guys
that is some of the questions that I've
answered from the Q&amp;amp;A that I put out my
Twitter will try to address some of the
other questions that a bit more specific
in another video because I realize this
video could end up being really really
long and because I like to give quite
extensive answers but I hope you guys
enjoyed that and it was a too long and
is useful if there's any other topics
you want me to talk about I'm gonna be
during these topical videos men much
much more I'm so excited and so
motivated you can clearly see look how
much I move like this hey thank you so
