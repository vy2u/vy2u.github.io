got to you hi guys welcome to my Channel
today I wanted to come to you a little
bit bare face a little bit transparent
because you know the thing I love to do
is to be as real as possible and one of
the things that I get asked the most
about is like basically having a youtube
channel
and I started it what I use as well and
how I make it all work so today we're
gonna get into it and a lot of people
don't necessarily want to share like the
ins and outs of what they use and how
they do it but today your girl she's got
to you and I'm gonna give you the realty
when it comes to shooting editing
filming and doing the YouTube video as
you can see my face is not done and a
lot of people think you know that a lot
of us have flawless skin no honey
a lot of us have amazing lighting an
amazing makeup I have two large lights
in front of me as you can see I've got
one big box like right here and one big
box like right here and I have my window
right here and I have a mic to the side
of me so I'll show you what it looks
like when the lights go off now
obviously the reason it looks this dark
is because my camera settings are quite
low because of the bright lights but
this is what it looks like when it's
brighter and without my lights so you
can see when I actually look like it
gives a bit of a different effect and
different this I do love daylight but
here in England is very difficult to
roll with that daylight because the
struggle is very real and it's very
inconsistent this is just an idea of
what it looks like without the right in
and let's get back into it all right so
next let's get into the makeup as you
can see my skin isn't flawlessly
flawless I have pores on my nose I am
shiny AF right now because I put my
sunscreen and everything on but the
power of makeup can transform me into a
real-life beauty guru first thing has
got to be the primer people necessary
when you are shiny and textured so 90%
of the time
I'm an oil slick so primer goes a long
way next up is the foundation and
honestly it can make or break your look
it's not even a joke and I'm not gonna
lie a lot of the times that my makeup is
a lot heavier because I was obviously
the lights and all that kind of stuff so
the right foundation is essential i am
using the mac clay skin and clarifying
foundation from the body shop i use this
i did some videos on their facebook page
use this foundation love it and find
that it looks great on camera as well as
in real life next up the concealer is
necessary thing of the dark circles are
dark i'm going in with my favorite full
coverage concealer it is from Kevyn
Aucoin once that's blended in with the
right brush it looks amazing I'm using
this n38 brush from the body shop as
well when I see a little of this bad boy
goes a long way okay setting my face is
so necessary because the shine comes
through this is not a time to be jewy
when the light is melt in your face so
I'm gonna use my Sacha powder and my
Laura Mercier I love both of these and
they work really well
I just set that go right in there so
next up it's my eyes and I'm using the
body shock I color sticks these are a
great base of a bit of shine and I find
that also when I put my eyeshadow colors
on they stick on more and pop more and
then with this brush also from the body
shop I'm not gonna lie I'm kind of lazy
when it comes to eye makeup but as long
as I've got a bit of pink or a red and a
bit of orange I'm good to go no light
false lashes are essential for some
reason you just don't pop without them
my favorite other hooter beauties and
then going to use at my bare minerals
foundation to contour and they actually
love this brush to contour with really
really good I'm gonna line my lips with
this liner from bite Beauty love this
shade and then gonna go in with this
matte liquid liquid Creek carnation love
the way this looks and feels and smells
okay so I'll be honest with you
the makeup takes the longest time and if
I haven't recorded normally because I
just can't be bothered it put a full
face or quote unquote YouTube makeup on
but when I'm in it I'm like yeah I'm
good to go
let me try and film one or two videos
okay next up cameras and equipment I get
asked a lot about this what camera do I
use what cameras do I recommend no I do
not think that the camera use matters
that that much but now that you know the
game is very elevated at this point in
time you probably do need a decent
camera I've always use a canon camera
because I find it the easiest to use and
that is what I taught myself on and I
also like my Canon for photography as
well my first recommendation is the
canon g7x - I believe this is and this
is about three to four hundred pounds it
might be up to 500 pounds and this is
quote-unquote entry-level but it's a
really good vlogging camera and it's a
nice small you know flip screen handheld
like this Here I am talking to the Canon
this is what it looks like on the Canon
and it's got really good lighting it's
even got an element of softening to it
and if you can notice that and there are
real afternoon but what you'll see is
that the colors aren't as true to life
or as vibrant but it's a great way to
start if you are struggling in the
camera department and you don't have
lots of money to spend on a camera and I
really like these to vlog and stuff on
after that it is the ATD again a great
camera this is what I feel my fashion
videos on it's great for you being able
to see yourself okay so this is what the
ATD looks like and what I really like
about the length I use is that it's
adjustable as well this is a really high
quality camera and it's actually quite
affordable it's a great way to start but
what I like is that you can go really
far out like this you can even see the
mess of that side of the room please
don't look at it and then you can also
bring it all the way back in as well
okay so this camera also has autofocus
in video which is really amazing which
my other camera does not ok so this is
my setup over here and this is my 5d
Mark 3 and this camera is just got a
full
Sensa basically picks up great color
it's really true to life very vibrant
and I can put my l-series lenses on
which are just fancy lenses that are
really good quality but it doesn't have
autofocus in video and I use it on a
tripod and then I also attach it to this
piece of software here so I'm able to
see myself but I also have a screen that
I sometimes use and then this is my desk
and I usually have a notepad if I have
something to say as well so yeah I think
that's a little insight into the whole
camera situation I would say stopped
cheap or start more affordable until you
know what you're gonna do
don't let not having 4000 pounds for a
camera stop you use a 300 pound camera
and see if you can be consistent with it
okay so you might have heard me mention
lenses I actually think lenses are more
important than the camera body you can
get a good quality lens then you are set
it's a lot of money they are new
investment and I've always been able to
sell my lenses on amazon or ebay because
lenses hold their value the lenses that
I recommend are the 50ml lens this is a
great lens for beauty close-up detail
again it's just beautiful this lens is
an L Series lens and I think this cost
like eight grand and a half but the
entry-level the entry-level fifty mil
lens it's a lot more affordable test it
out try it out see what you think and
50mm lens basically comes across tighter
okay so I have a good position I'm in
the same place this is what the 50mm
looks like and it's great again if you
want to show beauty detail it's great if
you just wanna be closer in but I prefer
using the 35 mil I just find that it
makes me look a little bit more
attractive so this is 35 mil this is my
preference and the fact that it's you
know slightly wider it makes you look a
little bit more trim and slim and not so
blow it so this is why it's my
preference and this is also an L Series
lens it's still slightly more affordable
than 50 mil lens but I love it and then
the final lens I use as you saw was my
wide angle which is a 10 to 20 to love
it for fashion because it gets lots in
it's basically a wide angle lens when it
comes to my lighting I have two big D
rights right in front of me which I
showed you I love these they make such a
big difference because listen the sky is
gray and the Sun comes in and out it's
an utter mess and these are diva lights
but initially I used an umbrella light
switch cover on Amazon you can get like
three or four lights for like a hundred
pounds and 200 pounds and they are a
great starting point so definitely go
for the umbrella lights to start off
with and see what you think lighting is
very essential it can make or break your
videos okay so when it comes to editing
I use Final Cut Pro X it is a piece of
software that I bought however you can
also use iMovie iMovie is free with Mac
I've learned everything I know about
editing and cutting and transitions I
learn it all by watching YouTube videos
so you know I'll see if there's a
playlist of how to edit out there and
you can check that out on what to do it
just takes time again I tell people I've
been doing this a long time I don't
think you need fancy editing or Francey
transitioning I think all you need is a
good and original idea and people will
watch what you're doing if you are doing
something that is great finally last bit
of tips when it comes to doing a youtube
video have your own idea comment with
something creative you don't necessarily
have to reinvent the wheel you might see
something that's out there you think you
know I could put my own twist on this I
could put my own personality on this I
can make this a little bit better I can
apply this to beauty I can apply this to
fashion I didn't apply this to something
else and just keep doing it consistently
you need to give people a reason to
watch your videos so looking at your
thumbnail and your title is essential
honestly give it a people a reason to
watch her and make them you know maybe
I'll have a look at
see that's interesting don't lie because
if you like that you're gonna affect
your video so if people click on your
video and then click off straightaway
that will actually like reduce how
reduce how many people see your video
because YouTube like looks out for that
and they know that if you use something
fake to grab people's attention they're
not doing the channel so just be aware
of that and the last three points are to
have passion and focus please get into
YouTube and creating content because you
feel like it for the right reasons I did
YouTube for four years and I didn't make
a single penny it was every weekend it
every Saturday every Sunday
it was my what I love doing it is still
what I love doing I loved sit in front
of this camera having a chat with you
guys being on Instagram being on
snapchat and just this is like my happy
place now I'm gonna like it's literally
my happy place so you really want to
genuine even passionate about making
videos and not trying to make a quick
buck and then focus so what it is that
you want to deliver why do they deliver
it just keep pushing at that that's all
it is really right guys that is the end
of this video I hope you found it useful
and we give you another man inspiration
if you're thinking of doing YouTube or
if you just want to know what's going on
behind the scenes there it is there
isn't much of rocket fighting to it but
this is just the reality of YouTube
lifestyle I hope you guys enjoyed that
video if you're not follow me on my
Instagram and my snapchat and my Twitter
