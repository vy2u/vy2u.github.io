done a video in over a week which to me
is like gasp I'm very sorry about that
but I took a little bit of a break I've
been on a girly holiday with my sister
and my besties we went to Valencia for
the weekend which basically inspired me
to do this video because Valencia was it
was literally torn up it was like
hardcore we had a really really good
time and I'm gonna tell you guys
something if you guys are looking for oz
bandya or you're looking for the bay you
might need to hit Valencia because over
there I'm a happily married woman by the
way but the men were on literally a
level 100 of hot now if you like a
little bit of a tan skin and a big gang
ye Hey look even my sister was a convert
the guys were super super hot and the
one thing I noticed which made me do
this video today was how much attention
I got maybe it's just cause Spanish men
are a little bit more forward than the
English men or the British men here but
yeah it was very very interesting and I
thought it was hilarious because growing
up I was always the ugly friend and even
now when I like stopped by guys in like
the street or gonna get chatted up I
just think ah like why are you talking
to me for not because I have like the
ugly friend mentality but it was almost
like guys just never liked me and it's
so funny to see what it's like today for
me again I'm not the hottest girl in the
world based on a benchmark of beauty but
you know what I'm kind of all right at
the end of the day but today I wanted to
do a video to give some of you guys who
are the ugly friend a little bit of hope
right and a little bit of direction
because a lot of people I know actually
started from being the ugly friend
including myself and trust me you don't
need to lose hope all you need to do is
get a level of understanding so number
one when you are the ugly friend you
don't get into any boy trouble because
nobody don't want your ass they ain't
fancying you they're not hollering at
you they're not trying to break you up
with your boyfriend because you
got a boyfriend your girlfriend's aren't
trying to pull your hair up because you
are not the one who's stealing them and
you are actually very safe from the
drama of boy trouble when you are the
ugly friend and I think the great thing
about not having a boy trouble is that
you get to focus on what really matters
like building your empire okay
building your future and your direction
you do not need to be worrying about
boys and what boys think about you the
one thing I realized about being the
ugly friend because I knew that they
weren't trying to move to me I was
always the girl that guys would come to
to tell me about the girl that they
liked or that they liked my friend and I
knew that they never liked me so I
became very very confident being around
guys and talking to guys because I he
don't like me anyway and I was very very
awkward when it came to relationships
iterations cuz I just wasn't used to
getting any form of attention from the
guys but at least I knew how to have
guys as my friends rather than like oh
my god he wants the end to me like
cringe when you're the ugly friend you
develop thicker skin you get to a point
of being like you know what I don't
really care what you have to say about
my physical appearance talking about
someone's physical appearance is like
the lowest common denominator or insult
or trying to make someone feel bad when
people used to call me lollipop head
because I had a big head and a small
body and buck-toothed and long foot and
dry dry foot dry and I was always dry so
I'm still kind of am they actually
sucked at but a after point is that that
really doesn't hurt me come with
something better because I know what I
look like and I know that I don't look
like you're standing up beautiful but
actually I feel like I'm alright looking
in my opinion bring up the ugly friend
you develop more Skills than just being
hot okay we know that you're not working
with much on the outside you work on the
inside you work on either being funny or
being creative or being smart or being
stupid or being really sporty and this
is one of the things that I know is that
I did a lot I really became someone who
was like loud and I've always been loud
as a person because I'm actually
relatively confident in myself and I
would just like to make people laugh
I'd like to make people feel good about
themselves because I felt good and in
so I even though I looked a bit crappy
on the outside but that ain't bother me
that didn't stop me and my husband who
now is mr. hot stuff mm-hmm he's tried
it Modell Mike he was they used to call
him football Cup head okay because he's
a big head and big ears okay
he's the palest of pale with really
blond really curly hair and freckles all
over his face he used to wear like a
head I shouldn't tell you this story but
I will he used to like a head sweatband
at night hoping that it would make his
ears go in sad times however if you meet
my husband he's literally the life and
soul because he's a super happy go get a
person super smart super motivated and
in the city he just developed other
schools and he's a mad sportsman why cuz
if he ain't gonna rely on his looks then
he's gonna work on other things that
make him better so doesn't matter what
you look like you just need to develop
other skills this is my favorite one
it's not peaking too soon now this is
great for me now that I'm mid-20s that I
look back on certain people who at 17
that was their heyday 17 18 was their
heyday I had not even begun I've not
even begun and it's so funny the way you
look at Facebook or Instagram you're
like oh what happened to you
this popularity is there and I don't
like the demise of other people but it's
very funny to see how the people who are
the popular goes the really hot girls
kind of are like at home crying they
don't like them and they're moaning
about their man but they're not changing
anything about it they hate their job
but they're not changing anything about
it because maybe everything came to them
so easily so they didn't try to change
anything in their life and actually
being that seventeen-year-old hot girl
in college was enough for them and
actually we're gonna live to win I quit
80 come on love let's get moving let's
do something but you will see that there
are certain people who peaked too soon
and I kind of love kind of sneaking
through Facebook to actually seeing that
you know what Patricia you kind of
turned out all right when a lot of
people looked at you thought you were
the dweeby s ugliest me kiss goal ever
and
look at me now the great thing about
being the ugly friend is you can work on
it okay you might not be working
genetically with much but the power of
wearing a bit of chapstick you know if
you have those ashy crusty lips you know
or know you need brow you can pluck the
unibrow you can wear a weave you can
wear some clothes and work on your body
and do stuff and do your nails and get
your teeth down and wear braces and do a
bunch of things actually become a little
bit better looking and when you realize
the power of actually just making a
little bit of an effort in the way you
look you can transform from the ugly
duck into the Swan of all swans
eventually I feel like everyone who was
the ugly friend eventually sworn into
being a beautiful person I know so many
people who were the ugly friend who were
not considered attractive and now
they're literally drop-dead gorgeous and
even if you are now a swan
somehow you continue to maintain the
ugly friend heart which is actually a
really good heart good mentality super
humble that will get you very far in
life and people will continue to like
you based on who you are as a person my
last piece of advice is especially for
you young girls you really don't need to
be worrying about what police think
about you right about now you ain't got
time for that drama especially if all
they care about is what you bloody look
like okay and finally we're all going to
get old ugly and wrinkly at some point
in time so you need to make sure that
you've got more than your looks to rely
on because there's always going to be
someone who's hotter than you skinnier
than you fatter than you lighter than
you duck the new blah blah blah all
kinds of nonsense so you better just
roll with it work with what you can make
changes where you can and just live your
life okay so thank you for watching guys
and I'll catch you later I'm probably
going to do a haul on Sunday thumbs up
