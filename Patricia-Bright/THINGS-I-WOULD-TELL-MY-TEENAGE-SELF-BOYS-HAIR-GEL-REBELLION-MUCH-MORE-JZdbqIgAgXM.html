yes we have another guest with us today
we have Shirley Shelley and I have been
YouTube friends and friends friends for
actually a long time but we don't really
long time he stops it usually started on
YouTube but we've never done a video
together we see each other quite
regularly and we always say we're gonna
film you never film you're not talking a
really long time and then yeah just
never getting we have talked for about
four hours already and will mentor
Thumbelina for else yeah like I got I
got it like a lemon Accord it is like to
say this is a sausage now we had a rice
so you don't mind
I cooked awesome mantle of Rome and it's
enjoying so anyway today we're going to
do I think kind of based a lot like
chats right but we're going to do the
things I'll tell my teenage self
well I was a bit of a geek so I would
always always want a geek or maybe have
hacked and I would probably to say -
just keep powering on and it's difficult
being that person that sticks out like a
sore thumb when everyone was to have fun
you're the one who's in the library and
you just want to like breathe and just
get on with your schoolwork that's cool
just I would say to myself that it's
okay
it's it's okay - yeah so I was a
completely opposite all right
I was like away with the fairies I was
quiet
I didn't concentrate a lot so I would
tell myself to concentrate and push
myself and I was actually really
academic um like I was smart I didn't
really try it hard I wish I tried harder
but like I was in like set five
initially and I got moved up to write
probably about setting one for most of
my topics besides maps other ones and
top six I came up there and I can't
leave yeah yeah I wasn't a teacher's pet
but then I was where are you I was at
you you guys all told I was it changes
because the teachers would pretend that
they're not allowed to laugh at me but
their lies to make joke to teach in fact
and just make them off and then sneak
around in their everyday
go sit down distracting that's what they
like no you like me like I - I told I
mention this before but I used to
collect the registers is how he was IQ
is he sounds so geeky but literally I
collected the registers when was I used
to like going into every class and like
warning beard running with the label
 in a row just like the top and
that sounds I was a prefect at school
because I used to be that girl with the
register
I was so cool dear and I was so coolly
but yeah I would tell myself to
concentrate more but yeah and like
embrace being smoked I feel like I
probably didn't embrace it I embraced it
Apple also say to get out more yeah be a
bit more sociable I went to a girls
school yes I did I even come on you just
don't think about you know what's funny
though I always this group of girls who
seemed to know a lot of boys we did know
a couple of boys outside of school
because right near our girls school
there was a body school yeah tightly
sales matter
we knew quite a few boys there they're
thinking about me is I didn't date
throughout my whole high school life I
just did that was like yeah my mom and
dad like you said tell me just to focus
on your books
don't bring any boy don't ladyboy it's
okay let's focus I hope we don't get
married when you are a grown woman I
wasn't too much into my appearance but
yeah I was like I would be a bit more
conscious about it I will tell my
teenage self most worried about that
yeah just to worry about you know being
a good person and being beautiful from
the inside in that way that would shine
that's this week so when it came to boys
no boys Mac to me right Oh Glee's yeah
no they just did night night like and
the thing is my friends were all really
really gorgeous like you know this
stereotypical gorgeous at that age so I
think mentally I was like I do really
care I was like the ugly friend am i I
had so many gorgeous one yeah yeah I was
the one with the caterpillar eyebrows
yeah yeah yeah Harry fee yeah big mouth
and the big teeth yeah yeah I'm sorry
the I by just not alright but I feel
like I kind of descends his house and I
didn't really care so much about boys
when I was there and a lot of my friends
were a bit what's the word hmm
a little bit free when it came to guys
and actually then because I was the ugly
friend I just didn't really go down that
street at all but I think deep down I
was like why don't guys like me but I
would just tell myself not to even worry
about that because there's only gonna be
one guy for me at the end of the day and
I'm going to meet him in about 10 to 15
years
I know but yet ten years ish and I'm
still waiting to meet my yeah exactly
he'll be there soon I don't got a couple
of years several years but yeah I tell
myself not to worry so much
and it probably realized that it's not
just about the way I look and the boys
that I was around the stupid but all of
those guys were silly and they didn't
care about anything besides being with a
really popular girl or a guy who was
willing to give it up so I I think they
almost knew that I wasn't gonna whether
god i doing up in when I was back in
high school as well I would say I would
say to myself it's okay just to be who
you are love yourself and not want to be
so quick into jumping into relationships
and you know doing things with boys
because I miss my boys interacting you
know I just wasn't gonna do yeah the
boys knew that I was not going to do any
of that either
so they would just be like okay yeah
it's like I had like a little sign on my
forehead that said virgin yes underneath
above the video is like you know what
was your old parent you money my
relationship my parents were really good
even till today I have a very good
relationship with my parents and I think
it's because everything was built on
respect yeah I respected my parents were
very engaged because I saw them respect
their parents and I always knew that my
parents had my best interests at heart
yeah whatever they said to me when I
agreed or disagreed I knew for a fact
that they not be enough because they
wanted me to have the best so I would to
say to myself that you should really
treasure your parents and like spend
time with them more for me my
relationship with my dad was really cool
and my dad's just a really chilled off
guard and fighted hedge with my
mom a lot and because we were very very
similar like the time I was like I hate
him well maybe I don't how did she wants
your mom not your mom
I should not be to you know know what
she did but I had a very and very
terminus relationship and I was a little
bit like troublesome at school so she
would be like you know you want to do
this affinity I've had I'm just naming
know slammed or I said to all of that by
yeah I know you could you can't go I
know my child would never be with you
like me no I was a difficult child and I
and I would tell my childhood self that
to understand that my relationship with
my mom doesn't have to be like that and
actually she's reasonable if I reasoned
with her and also that you can't always
have your own way you like trying to
fight an adult on stuff it's probably
not the best thing to do your mom cares
about you and probably wants the best of
you so try a little bit and also tell my
because I have a really good
relationship with my mom but just to
tell myself that you are going to get on
like a house on fire in the future
this is super quick me and my sister
have always been close and I just say
always be close with her do you know
what I tell my childhood self probably
give her a little bit more room stop
hanging around with her so much I had I
hung around my sister so much she was
like you know my best my best friend is
my best friend my sister's my best
friend yeah I had wrong with us still
too much I would say to my teenage self
that it's okay being the oldest because
I used to feel so pressured when I was
asked the oldest child because I had to
be responsible for everything I was
always getting blamed for everything
what this person is this is because you
taught them that I would say to my teen
yourself of not to worry that they would
actually end up appreciating you and
actually I would say to myself not to
convince Maureen to do bad things
I would like leave more and alone and
happy oh goody two-shoes right I got a
goody two-shoes stop making her cover
for you and you did something wrong okay
leave her alone
oh yeah I would definitely tell like
that oh as a teenager I can't actually
say to you that I've kept in contact
with in your one teenager Oh totally
agree I don't I don't really speak to
many of them even um even some of the
ones I was close with at the time there
and now I've later learned that some
friends come in for a season a reason
for a lifetime so when I was a teenager
I reckon I had those friends for that
time yeah and then as I grew older and I
became you know much wiser I guess and
we'll mature um I just picked out
friends that suited who you are and
lighter yeah and not that have anything
like wrong with them even though I had
some friends I would fall out with a lot
when I was in
school I'll promise a to my teen
yourself not to worry too much about it
that years and years from now it won't
even matter all that all the arguments
all the stress or the you know horrible
feelings and stuff but then also I say
to me to yourself to treasure the
moments because yeah you do get to this
this bit yeah I had friends but like I
never had deep friendships so I would
move around from different groups to
different groups and I think that's
because I never really felt settled with
any one group in particular so I knew a
lot of people but there was no one I
could ever go to and say this is my
friend who besides primary school
there's only like one girl was like my
best friend but I never felt like I ever
had that connection with anyone but I
think I would just tell myself that you
know your sister is your best friend and
it's okay she was my best friend
and I think I'd say develop deeper
relationships if you can but I think
with the people who are around me now
that I'm older I didn't want to develop
deep relationships with any of those
people anyway and I was a good friend to
like some people I told you the story
like a girl actually came to me like I
used to like me used to be really tight
friends and she used to get into a lot
of trouble and stuff like that but I
kind of always stood by her she got
bullied a lot but I just you know had
her back and about four three years ago
she sent me a message on Facebook she
converted to Islam and she was like you
know what Patricia I'm so embarrassed of
all the things that happened when we
were younger younger but I really
appreciate your friendship and how you
stuck by me so I'm just going to say
just keep being like that and stand up
for those friends who might be
criticized
and three okay so like I said I was
quite introverted for the majority of my
university life and I think for a very
long time because I was like that there
was a point in time where I thought I
hate being like this I want to run bail
yeah I want to be that extroverted
person I want to now go out so I would I
would I would try and be that rebellious
type yeah and try and be like rude to by
some of the teachers and that's what the
educator come in like mm-hmm
I would probably say no surely don't try
don't try it
sit sit stay the way you are it'd be
respectful you are respectful person to
stay in respectful don't try and get
rude in tried to prove a point and try
and repel the itraq a confession poof
I tried the cigarette one and I remember
coughing so badly and thinking or not
love doing this again but like I thought
like oh my god I felt so guilty you have
such huh I can't believe he said that
I'm gonna tell why still you know I
don't cry sometimes I pee because like I
was probably you know you don't you
thought smoking was such a grown-up the
area and like like no one around me
nobody in my family smokes so I thought
I'll be a little rebellious and I'll see
right yeah I wonder what money my lunch
money lunch did buy I go I went out said
okay I want to see what this thing is
like and I went and bought it in two and
I didn't have a lighter our sister later
like caught on so you went to the shop
by yourself by myself and I got
cigarettes by yourself yeah Marlboro at
the time yeah brave yeah brave this is
me trying to rebelled against this quite
shy person and I remember trying to
smoke it my future behind the woods
somewhere and I smoked it and I remember
I had such a bad coughing fit and sore
throat for day
and I told my mom because I felt so
guilty whether your mom say I'm also I
try that again
I would be too just to argue with my mom
too much like honestly if I would say
look don't bother arguing of your mom
just listen to her she knows what she's
talking about
just just just let it go my next thing
would be similar to Shelley which was
actually not to try lead yeah
Congo dijo shoes Patricia did funnily
enough it was move like the grungy group
like I would climb anything now I would
teenagers find one honestly some of
these girls especially like the girls
were into like you know rock bands and
stuff like I was calling them but their
parents would let them smoke in the
house and I think a lot of that parents
actually had weed and they would get it
from their moms I'm like Katie Katie is
like smoking they're not yeah we're just
going football mom grandma something
like that and I went with them foolishly
once like a mom I like a more okay and
then I like two cars and I remember just
thinking it was happy so let there yeah
I did it
I would advise myself to do it again I
did it when I was at university yeah as
well but so I did it once and I just
thought was smelled really bad like B oh
yeah that's disgusting
I don't know what I want to do that ya
know and Patricia only like sweet boys
that don't like bad boys like sweet boys
who buy you roses and chocolate hold
your hands and take you cinema okay I
would probably say that to money
teenage the eyes were bad boys or
whatever so not good because I remember
I've been loved I don't really say love
Canadian website you can think you're in
love again I also was in love and then
he just entered cheating yeah just now
probably say to myself don't worry about
it a good player good guys
yeah okay Oh dry sense dress at a
adherents what we did I would say man
just fix up a little bit just like
something oh my god my style when I was
back in high school I think it's because
majority of time we spent in school
uniform
if you don't know yes you know just up
in the UK you are in school uniform tote
and in some case to you're 18 yeah high
school yeah so like you didn't really
there was no room to express your
personal style and I would I would try
to express my personal style with my
school uniform by maybe having a shorter
tie than a longer time I think it he
hated her short fact I try time I like
the show I might open show me little
boss I had you're better than that one
day I would also tell myself oh my gosh
appearance don't put slashes in your
eyebrow you did but I did that yeah I
was good I see I was I did that like the
razor when I cut in there
oh one crazy like slash my eyebrows yeah
you know how I mentioned I had really
thick slug eyebrows let's believe one
day I find my mum's blade and I said let
me try and give myself I will shape this
one it got me thin so I was like hey let
me shave this one got a bit thinner but
not this one is still a bit thinner so
this much but the end of it I know I
know eyebrows long came in she looked at
