wake up okay open my mouth oh my god
Jess hi good hungry you have to be dolly
can take that finger out your mouth love
hey guys welcome to my channel
look who we have here it is Grace and
she is all grown up I mean I say all
grown up she's like four months old but
four months from you know being just
born is niala and I don't really show
her much on this channel just because
she's a mother of Channel much and but I
thought it'd be nice for me to come here
today and kind of give you guys an
insight into what it's like being a new
mama you know and I feel like I've now
learned so much at this stage and I just
really enjoyed it and yeah I thought
it'd be nice to see her because she's
four month in a day from now so it's
crazy to believe she's in good spirits
as of because my mom is white he's doing
it all posing and bacon here so I'm
gonna let grace go I'm gonna give you
guys lowdown on being a new mama so
first things first
I'm asked a lot about sleep and I'm
gonna be honest with you she is for the
week I thought that you know maybe I'd
get some rest by often my lack of sleep
during pregnancy no no no sleep is
something that is a memory it is a
complete and utter memory and as a new
mom especially with a newborn
they definitely and wake up every two
hours and you can be a walking zombie in
the first week and then now that grace
is around four months old she now only
wakes up once or twice a night which is
great but also you know it would be
beautiful to have a full night's sleep
for to be able to sleep for like 10 til
seven straight it's literally like a
bliss and there are times that my mom
you know takes my little one for a night
and helps me just to get a full night's
sleep and it feels like I'm in a luxury
resort just because I'm able to get a
full eight hours so point number two is
about breastfeeding and I'm sure if
you're a new
you probably know breast-feeding hurt
like no man's business it I feel like
like given birth was less painful than
the breastfeeding part of it like it's
crazy how much it hurts in the very
beginning and I know people talk about
you know that latch being wrong that's
the reason why it's painful blah blah
like no like it it does hurt in the very
beginning so basically I referred to the
breastfeeding like a shark attack and
what normally happens is that baby use
babies use their like initial centers
and they routes so they can kind of
Center smell your breast your breast
milk and they go like that I think like
snatch on Lucci like a shop and were the
first like two weeks it was like so
painful and then what I found
and when I say painful it was
toe-curling in every single moment that
grace is going to get on I would just
brace myself because I knew it was gonna
hurt but actually what happened that
like two weeks it just let the pain
disappeared like it just was gone and
then going forward it did not hurt but I
want to warn new mommies out there and I
know there are mamas out there who are
like why does it hurt you know what I
think it definitely has you know the
nipples are very sensitive and for
someone to be basically sucking on them
ten times a day it's going to get a
little bit so you know a little bit of
nipple balm is always helpful and always
useful as long as it's like safe for
baby
so my next point is when it comes to the
clothing number one you will receive a
ton of clothing from friends and family
and you'll have all these ideas of all
them amazing outfits you're going to put
your newborn in and all the pictures
you're going to take effort maybe that's
just me but all the pictures you're
going to take and how she's going to
look in everything and the first thing
you'll realize is that she's probably
gonna wear a baby girl 99.99999% of the
time
nobody's got time for trousers and
buttons and layers and coats and
pinafore just put her in a baby grow and
be done with it or you'll find that she
ends up growing out of the items so
quick like there was certain clothing
that she didn't even get sniff of and
sadly she does not fit into it already
and I'm like
why grace why I have enough clothes to
put her in a new outfit every single day
obviously she changes so much it's crazy
and sadly you might put her in an outfit
and within our 10 seconds it's dusty and
rusty already I found that I had a ton
of books like new baby books that were
given to me and stuff and I was reading
them like I was reading Bible and
scripture I think was like everything to
me and I'm sure there are lots of new
moms who feel that way and I mean it's
nice select local websites and read
books and learn different things like I
learned a lot about breastfeeding and
latching on the like and the good stuff
I learned a lot about sleep and sleep
routines and all kind of stuff and I
realized that I didn't uh good day like
that the information out there is
absolutely amazing there's so many good
things out there where you can learn a
lot but there's nothing like just
listening to how your baby works and
what she likes and I tried to put her on
like a sleep schedule in the middle of
the day and she just looked at me like
and now like no no mama it ain't
happening so and the books are like put
her down at nine o'clock after you wake
her up at seven o'clock meanwhile I'm
that snoring with good graces foot on my
face and I waking everybody up so take
all the books and the research with a
pinch of salt and make sure you trust
your own instance as well now this is
going to see absolutely crazy but I
never thought that I'd be fascinated by
bowel movements and I'm telling you if
my baby haven't done the poo in like two
or three days I'm like when's your poo
squeeze you need to do a poo and when
she does a poo the celebration I'll do
it is crazy I'm like girl feel that
nappy go ahead girl
enjoy it I know there's nuts like I've
actually even said pictures to hobby of
Gracie's poop
and I'm like she's not a good one I hope
like oh yeah good on you grace I don't
know it's not just me he does that where
you're like doing a song and dance or
your baby pees and this is probably when
she was a little bit younger because
when then you were they don't poo as
much and especially when they are
breastfeeding they don't poo
brokenly because of the way that they
that the milk doesn't have a lot of
waste but when she did poo I was like go
grace
so sterilization when you've got a new
baby you're like obsessed of sterilizing
everything wiping down everything
putting everything in the steamer and
the sterilizer and I was doing this like
before a feed after feel during feed
like constantly sterilizing and actually
now it's like I sterilized my balls once
a day I always give them a wash and
everything but I realized I was being a
little bit excessive and the whole thing
is about basically ensuring that there
is an old milk inside your bottles and
initially you're a bit like worried
about germs and stuff but when the
babies like you know sucking her hand
it's not sterile when she's sucking your
boob it's not sterile so there's lots of
encounters that she had that are not
sterile that aren't killing her and if
anything are gonna boost her immune
system so I found that I have literally
a million nicknames for grace and the
nicknames not even the nicest names and
I'm gonna break them down one of her
Nick's name is Eleni
and the reason why we call her lenny is
because in my first one that i was
pregnant she was the size of a lentil
and from then we called her lenny she's
got a name which is sir pasa tall which
is a horrible day to give a little girl
but it means something to me and
positing is basically when a baby throws
up and like but like you know the normal
throw up and I found that when she
posited on me I just decided to call her
a boss pass at all and then it became
surplus at all and then that's her
actual name and then she's got um gums
as well because when she smiles she's
very coming at she has no teeth in her
mouth and I've got a bunch of names for
her that aren't the nicest and I'm sure
loads of moms out there do that they
have like 10,000 nicknames depending on
what mood she's in
she's got gummy bear she's got smoothers
because she always does this
and that actually smoothness doesn't
actually do this mr. burns does this but
I mean there's a reason behind it she's
got fear of God which you guys knows
which is when her eyes basically but
bulge out over her head which is
hilarious now I was a kind of person
from the dawn of day to take forever to
in my house right but nev in my house
now you know it might not even happen
you might get ready to leave the house
and you might be like you know what it's
not I'm just gonna shut the door today
I'm telling you there have been times
I've been like getting ready to go back
pack everything you know bottles done
everything done as you're walking out of
the door or here is one kind of
squeezing out a number two number three
number three you know cuz it is number
three's exist and you just think now we
got to start all over again the whole
outfit is covered in poo and just
realize that you're 45 minutes late
after you're already an hour late like
it just happens and I have found that um
I have to live my life with military
like military precision if I want to get
anything done like it's not I have to do
everything well in advance or or wake up
really early to do anything for myself
but yeah please note scheduling is
essential you'll find that a baby can
have the coolest person looking like the
biggest fool trust me when I baby is
crying or is grumpy and want
entertainment you will be dancing around
like a chicken waving your arms singing
songs making faces just making a big old
fool of yourself
and you think it's just few cuz you're a
parent it's not even the case I swear
every time like maybe grace makes a
whimper I've seen grown men doing little
dance a little jig just to keep her
happy and I think it's hilarious so if
you're a serious person like a baby will
make you do the serious things for all
my mommies out there with little girls
yeah your girl unless you're lucky is
gonna be mistaken for a boy I get what's
his name how cute is he uh isn't he
beautiful and I'm like no it's a she and
you were still say she and someone would
still say he and I spent money on
headband
and everything just to show you know
this is a girl someone's still gonna
call her Bob at some point in time I
found my getting her ears pierced as
well hopefully that will help when it
comes to you and your body the reality
is that your body will never look the
same and this is a matter of fact now
whether it's better or worse is
subjective but it's not going to look
like would it look like prior to you
having a baby your boobs are going to be
a little bit larger or maybe a little
bit smaller skin is going to be a little
bit looser maybe a bit tighter your abs
are going to be a little bit shot your
thighs might be a little bit thicker and
I think it's really important for women
to realize that you're gonna look
different and it's up to you to work out
you know what you want to do about it
I've seen women who've had like you know
big pregnancies where they got massive
and then decided to become body builders
afterwards and get ripped and just
ridiculous and then petite women who've
got even more patita
or petite women who have bloomed up and
you know like their newfound curves and
stuff so it's all about you kind of
realizing that it's not gonna be the
same but you don't have to be like left
of whatever you don't want and you can
always do something about it and the
gravity is that you know pregnancy does
have its battle scars but you know what
you have at the end of it is absolutely
amazing and even when I look at my
lifetime I give it a little bit of a
jiggle and stuff and I'm gonna do
something about it you know I'm still
working on it intensely but I don't look
at it with disdain rather just like you
know it came with the journey and I'm
okay with that this one here the mummies
will no baby hands right these things
have got the strength of Hercules and I
can't tell you about the amount of hairs
that have been snatched out of my weave
it is not a joke once a baby decides to
clamp on something that's it I said you
know your your hair is gone if you're
not wearing a weave boy you might need
to wear your hair up in a ponytail or a
scarf because you will be bored by the
end of it it's not a joke baby hands are
the cutest but the strongest and
dangerous thing especially with their
nails you need to click those nails
every other day if not your
like one she'll be your baby will
probably end up scratching themselves
you know but blood everywhere or you
will have scars all over you frightening
I'm gonna make the point that babies can
waste your time but in the greatest way
you can find yourself literally staring
at your baby while she's asleep for
hours I'm the kind of person that
sometimes it opened the door just stare
through the gap at the door just to see
what she's up to while she's by herself
and you know you might end up just
playing with your baby for hours
watching tell you of her and just
letting the day just go by as you just
enjoy your baby and those moments are
littering the most amazing woman's ever
and I think every parent gets it where
you're just like I don't want to do
anything today let's just play let's
just enjoy each other and I think I
never prior to having a baby ever did
that just have moments of just doing
jackal and nowadays I have those
probably like once a week which is
amazing so guys those are some of the
things I've found out about having a new
baby and as I say it's been a beautiful
and wonderful experience and I love it
and hopefully that gave you guys know
bit insight until you know what I deal
with but also you know that ladies out
there who are going through that process
right now let's just get an amen and
high-five together so guys thank you for
watching and I'll see you later bye so
today I've got the 50 P a day phase
because I really like the look that I've
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
