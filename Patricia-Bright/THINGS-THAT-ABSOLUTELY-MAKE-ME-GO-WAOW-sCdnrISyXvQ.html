oh my bad my bad
oh my bad no beautiful people welcome
back to my channel
I hope you are doing well today I'm
about to share the things that I find to
be absolutely fantastic the things that
make me go wow the stuff that I really
really really like I feel like I'm kind
of known for like telling it how it is
you know being a little bit - I did know
a little bit too honest but sometimes it
can come across as like constructive
criticism I hope but there are stuff
that is amazing that I have to tell you
I'm sponsored unfiltered the stuff that
I think it's absolutely fantastic that
want you guys to know about so that is
exactly what we're gonna do in today's
video also it's oh wow it's really
around if you don't know that I have
launched my merch and everything and
what I've done is I've just done it
based on your requests so many of you
guys like Patricia put on a jumper put
on the t-shirt do something I've got a
limited amount of items a couple of
while t-shirts a couple of Shannon
Shannon t-shirts as well and some
hoodies and that kind of stuff and I've
done a short amount of designs and I'm
gonna just do this for like two or three
weeks I'm going to keep it open once
they're gone they're gone and then just
basing them on see if you guys want more
designs I know you look guys I've
mentioned rich in color rich in life you
guys don't know much a little more than
I know myself inside this is actually
crazy so let's see how it goes probably
for the next two or three weeks and then
people would do some more you know get
summertime fat so but yeah let's get
into this video so number one right so
it's been in this hat this hat it's
either hate it or love it
I've heard some people saying why does
it look like you have a trash bag on
your head
but this hat has absolutely been my like
favorite hats giving me 95 it's giving
me like Black Panther vibes and you know
that the beret was like really really
trendy right now sir
seen it like not there a needed like a
patricia version of a beret so I felt
like this bad boy was just you know a
patricia version of a very how cool is
it it's like it's given me like brush
print billionaires it's kind of various
but it's also kind of nineteen file and
I really like it especially when I have
a middle part and this was only twelve
pounds on Azoff and I've worn it all the
time when the days and the Wiggy is not
laid and the hair is looking all kinds
of this has been the thing that has
really really just made my look come
together you guys know I'm slightly
bougie especially when it comes to the
skincare department so there are some
skincare bits I'm like oh my gosh these
are absolutely fantastical and number
one it's this enormous superfood night
cream this is new so I was basically
using their illumise Pro collagen marine
oil fitness finish this was my bad
boyfriend every single night love it
love it love it I kind of swapped this
out and started using this and I love
how creamy and moisturizing and how
light it is and it's a prebiotic night
cream and it's just really good skincare
I'd rather put up my skincare video or
my skincare video is going to come out
and like you know I've got 18 steps I've
got a lot of layers which always
includes an either oil or moisturizing
luster this is now become part of my
last last step and it's really gentle as
well which I really really like I love
this smell kind of smells a bit soil
like but anything that smells kind of
natural I'm down this is really really
good this one you guys might have seen
that I had a partnership with Bobby
Brown but I genuinely wanted to just if
you guys don't know about the all-day
weightless foundation from Bobby Brown I
want you guys to know how amazing it is
my ad might have run in front of this
video because I did an ad campaign with
them in New York last year but I
honestly want to say that I love this
foundation I use it all the time and it
is in my everyday wear the long side
like one or two others that I wear that
maybe at nighttime or whatever on a day
where I'm just rushing to get ready I
just put this on it's so quick it's so
easy and it does last all day it's oil
free of shine control and I feel like
I use it I just look great in it's not
the most rich in color it's like more of
a very neutral shade on me but I prefer
that for like everyday wear because it
means that I don't have to do the most I
don't have to do extra highlighting
extra contouring I just literally brush
that is Shawn fill in my brows and I
appeal I'm gone not only that this is
another goodie I have from Bobbi Brown I
think I received this in PR or when they
sent me this as part of my campaign this
has now become a lifestyle for me if you
don't have that like perfect makeup bag
that right sets your life in order you
need one not that you need this one if
you can get like a proper makeup case
like this guy I don't know if they sell
these I don't know I don't think they do
so these action I basically have this
everyday routine where I just have this
I literally use this I get ready with
this every single day and just by having
like one selection of makeup to do my
face of everyday I look good but before
when I had so much makeup and I'm going
through my whole collection and I didn't
know what I was doing my life was chaos
it was literally chaos I don't know why
I feel like this is literally
transformed my getting ready process
like honestly look at my own is I'm like
telling you it's really a well it's
really a well it's made such a big
difference to me let's just do a
skincare thing right now I'm going to
show you two products number one is the
kills purifying foaming cleanser so I
swear I stumbled on this on accident
when I left my skincare bag at home when
I was traveling away if I don't have my
skincare I'm like listen if it's not
it's not working so I went to go pick up
a few pieces and I picked up this
cleanser because it seemed like a good
cleanser to me but it talked about
overall improvement in skin color
clarity and it just seemed like it was
gonna be a good cleanser not only is
this creamy its moisturizing so when I
like phone phone phone as much foam as
it rose on my face where I rinse it off
it feels like there's literally
moisturizer on my face it feels so good
on it's unbelievable and I generally
feel like it's kind of been making my
skin like underneath look a lot more
clearer and clarified and it's fabulous
and I don't know why I hadn't used this
before I don't think it's new my
stumbled on it
like life-changing life-changing it's
part of my everyday skincare regime
alongside my Clinique cleansing balm I
use that and then I use this CCL detail
skin scare it fancy-fancy
your fans huh finally our skincare right
this issue's good this ish is good as in
when I use it it burns
I'm not gonna like it but if it's like
oh let's get this you get in tingle so
it's basically a really pure form of
vitamin C it's not creamy it even feels
kind of gritty it feels gritty on the
skin so I feel like there's like a
soluble version of vitamin C inside the
product and if your skin is sensitive it
might take a while for you to get used
to it but girl I'm used to it now I even
like that tingle burning sensation it
makes me actually feel like it's working
it's doing extra work because it burns
but it's not actually burning it's just
like a very very active and I love it
and again since I just switched out my
skincare bits put this in I feel like my
skin looks more glowy and more radiant
and more even which I'm really really
excited about it's a pricey piece but I
don't care I like it actually go back
into some fashion okay
oh Lord I'm being bougie and fancy again
I'm sorry I am sorry I realized that
Valencia was basically my favorite
designer brand because I realized that
actually one of the first designer
pieces I ever bought was Balenciaga
which was a pair of sandals that I got
for like half price which is really
cheap for a design item and I said yes
and then I bought another bad which I
did definitely sell to someone in
Germany and I realized that my life
Valencia Unger collection makes me happy
and nowadays what I avoid doing is
buying like the really trendy designer
items but I by the designer items that I
feel will match my lifestyle or what's
important to me so I have this bag here
you know it's expensive but it's nowhere
near as expensive as all the other banks
that are out there right but I use it
all the time and use all the time I
carry it cute and then I also
carry it you know kind of Street I just
put it over my shoulder and I'm good you
know I can do whatever I want to do with
this back and I love it like it gets so
much used it doesn't feel like you know
some some designer bags you like oh
maybe a my bag I'm a bag but this bag
I'm right but I could just throw it and
I just feel comfortable they have always
looked epic it's become a favorite of
mine and then I feel like I didn't want
to show you guys these because you're
gonna laugh at me cuz they're slightly
spearmint oh I think they're very
spearmint oh but they care so these are
the Balenciaga stop boots so they have
like the ankle stop boots which I didn't
pick up but they had these ones that
were over the knee all the way to the
side there was something that just
called my name about these I think I
bought these back in January so I say
that I try and buy designer items once a
year to two times a year maybe three
times a year these are the kind of
basically spare shoes on god-being
people feel they are Spears but they
look mad cute on this so cute
I've been wearing them all the time okay
not all the time but I love wearing them
with like jogging problems or like loose
trousers and you know when I've got
volume in a really sleek shoe they look
phenomenal and it just makes you look
extra sexy like look how long it is love
it okay guys so I've already done a
video knees I did a comparison video
between these and the Urban Decay
concealers it's the makeup revolution
the 6-pound concealers and I just
realized what I just realized this is
where they're in this one video is that
these are so good if you're struggling
to find a good concealer you can take
any of these mix them and make a
concealer that is perfect for you
I find that they don't crease much I
don't find that they kind of gather
underneath here I feel like the colors
really rich once they're set they look
absolutely amazing they're just a great
bargain and they get every day used to
me and the combination
between Shay 12 and 13 but I also use
shade 11 on my eyelids to kind of create
a base for my eye look and I found that
since I started using those to do that
my eye look pops so much more and
they're just so good I'm wearing them
today I use them all the time and
they're just fantastic okay a few little
pieces
number one the benefit BADgal bang that
mascara I feel like people either like
this or hate this and I don't know why
would anyone take this for me with my
lashes that are just but they're just
thin that you're like there's just not
much there these have given my lashes
life they give my lashes life they lift
them up they stretch them out they give
them volume and they give them blend and
I found it I've been so comfortable with
my lashes when I wear this that I've
been wearing that my eyelash is a lot
less regularly I know some people think
it's a little bit clumpy or so but for
my lashes I find it phenomenal because I
don't have much lashes and it gives me a
lot of lashes I think this is great this
bad boy this I want to thank you guys I
want to thank you guys because I made it
advertently clear how much I did take a
look at Lubert steam
I made it overtly clear how much I
detest I am in I did test ironing I made
the decision not to buy certain items
based on how much they look like they
needed to be ironed and when I made that
point in my desire video you guys are
kind enough to tell me this and Patricia
get yourself a hand steamer but I have
so many messages and so many comments
about that and that evening I went on to
Amazon found myself this bad boy for
twenty pounds bought it and I feel like
it's changing my life I feel like a
whole water could be iron the ball
because I'm ready I can handle it
because I now have this amazing piece of
technology which is basically water and
heat steam
like these I mean I did know but I
didn't know they'd have a mini hands
dmoz it's so funny because when I used
to work in retail you had this big
steamer or like some machine that we
used to sting in the clothes with but
you know this like Shh something so good
like and I'm not gonna lie I've been
lazy enough that I've worn item being
like it's creased and I just go no no no
no no but you have to be very careful
because if it spurts water you get a
burn but my skin is like rhinos skin so
I never get bad like I'm fine
but so good like honestly like wow okay
guys that is it from me they saw all the
stuff that I'm making mean gum Wow
well I'm gonna like the stuff that I
really like at the moment as you can
tell when I'm excited my I just go so
extreme I have to try and turn myself
down sometimes but you know it's
honestly it's what I like so I wanted to
show those goodies of you so I hoped you
