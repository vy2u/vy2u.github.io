trends that needs to be buried in 2017
we gotta let them go hello lovely people
I hope you are doing well today we are
about to get into it we're gonna go into
the trends that need to be dead and
buried in 2017 the things I just like
you know what let it go leave it in
there and I'm a huge fan of Jackie I
mean you know I love her video that she
does I think she does it like every year
and then there's a few other videos I've
seen of the trends that people want to
leave in 2017 and I had to jump on the
bandwagon because I have my own things
that I gotta say okay and I'm a bit
concerned because I know that we're
living in a society where everybody is
triggered
so if you are to a good person I mean
this video might not be for you if you
want to send this and you want to
trigger this for all those that are
around you that are triggered feel free
to do that that's fine and I'm laughing
because hopefully it makes me laugh in
general and I put my hands up and I can
tell you right now I've done that night
tippers and other things that I'm about
to be in this video I am no saint and I
am no like you know perfect person and
I'm not the rule or anything I'm just
going to say the things that I'm like
you know what
Madonn with it I don't want to see that
anymore I'm over it okay so boy
subscribe if you're not already
subscribed subscribe before you trigger
for those who aren't true then you're
gonna be like yes girl stay to the end
and add your own two pets in the
comments I want to hear what you're
thinking and then also if you're not
following you on my social you can
follow me on my Instagram where
hopefully I'm not doing any of these
things on my snapchat and on my Twitter
as well
hold on TLC okay okay let's go number
one Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon this
pose has been opposing our lives for the
last couple of years and I'm over it
the reason being is that this is not
reality this pose is far from reality I
have attempted to do this pose but yeah
I'd like a baby trying to take a dump in
them happy
I look like I have dislocated a hip I
have broken bones and I look a hot mess
I do not look good in this pose and I
see it I'm like you are selling dreams I
feel like there are other ways that you
can show an outfit without having to get
on your all fours while you faceplant
into the ground get up an attempt to
look cool it just it just irks me
because in reality that poses hard a F
no I don't want to be up the PR list but
I'm gonna be honest I'm gonna say it I'm
over Gucci I'm just over excessive Gucci
I've seen good to your hair everywhere
and the big GG is just here for all eyes
to see and you know what I'm not
innocent here's my gorgeous beautiful
fantastic Gucci Mane walk bag which I
live for I love however I'm in the
position where I let you see about
18,000 of these bags I see 14 million
t-shirts jumpers and now we got cursory
headbands and Gucci belt which I have as
well and it's just I just think you know
what we're done well you start wearing
the Gucci had found the Gucci t-shirt
the Gucci bag the Gucci bow the gucci
flip-flop Gucci going what you're going
put your game goes you're going you're
going good you can once again miss your
game put your game
okay good you can couch again rather go
and Bob all man okay but you can't lose
your game good game good game good you
get I don't know what Gucci is paying
your mortgage let it go
nowadays we know what we have to show
like the designer like right here look
at me it's Gucci it's shut down it's
like we get it you spent some money on
stuff like we've heard like we know you
know I love design that as much as the
next person but when it is a top to toe
outfit I've got Gucci fatigue okay so
this next one is annoying and
impractical and it is perfect
shoes or should I just say clear plastic
shoes inspired by and I believe it was
like the first easy collection or maybe
the second easy collection of shoe so
we're in they make your feet sweat right
your feet will be sweating your toes
slip and slide and they're so
uncomfortable
let litchi clear plastic shoes are
uncomfortable shoes are not made to be
made of like this hard shiny plastic and
what you end up seeing is people's toes
just looking or depressed them or you
know let alone if they're tight and
he'll fit in your toes look like claws
let it go I've had perspective and when
I wore them I couldn't believe the level
of pain I was in perspecsys you're off
my list okay this trend here I say this
I'm gonna be honest I'm a hater and the
trend I'm done myth is under boobage on
the boobage because in a reality I've
got fake boobies if you guys don't know
my boobies are fake okay and even the
way my fake boobies are set up under
boob is not working for me
you can see milk ducts you can see
areola you see too much a lot of people
make it look so chic and classy I notice
I've even attempted it because I look at
that on the boob when I say well that's
the turn that isn't for me so I don't
want to see anymore under boobs because
I can't do it and I know a lot of
you're like sorry the way my breasts hi
listen okay so coming back to an
Instagram beauty trend telling you this
one hurts myself and it elsewhere so
because I'm a frugal girl I like to save
quite I don't like to waste it
and when I see people doing the dripping
makeup malarkey
and I just think that's a that's a lot
of products you know it's a lot of
product you use eight drips for what
takes one drip and I just think of the
coin being washed down the drain or
being rubbed into hands or even worse
being wiped off by a tissue and we just
stop doing that because it hurts product
as expensive as for Sally and some of
these other products are really good and
they don't need to be wasted they need
to be used with respect okay it's an
instant gun trend that I've done I've
done it and I and it's a lie you know I
don't want is people to lie on Instagram
in 2018 that's not like especially when
it is cold people might be getting
hypothermia their kidneys account let's
stop this now let's stop the lies and it
is wearing the jacket off the shoulder
you know where you see that hold up then
we just let me just let me just get it
for you it's three degrees centigrade
you have a bralette
and a puffer jacket on and you decided
that your shoulder needs to be out
selling dreams selling lies this stuff
here is gonna give you hypothermia wear
your coat properly okay coast needs to
be on it doesn't really cool not gonna
lie but it's a lie it's a lie you're
outside you're shivering I've done this
I've been shivering taking a photo but
yet you do for the ground this is this
this has got to be left in 2017 let's
tell people the truth when it's cold
wear your jacket put your hood on tell
the truth I love I love this app right
but I feel like it got used to overkill
in 2017 and it is the app code Kira Kira
is that that makes everything Twinkle
Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle shining SHINee
shut everything is listed right
basically it came in to people's
everyday Instagram
they just Shawn literally like a beaming
life and I even didn't lift a gun post
I'll drop it in I did it right I had
like this outfit that was beaded and
whatever I mean I turned to the side and
lit you even my eye glitter King the
highlight for the middle of my eye was
shining it's too much and the way you
end up you know looking at an outfit and
Instagram and you physically can't see
that outfit because all you can see is
these shine and you need glasses to
watch the Instagram post leave it leave
it in 2017 you need to go we're done
with you you know what we need to leave
Photoshop I just I just can't
I've seen some photoshop that I'm like
you do not even need to do this why are
you doing this you do not need to
Photoshop that image that makeup it
looks fantastic but you've made yourself
look like a robot and I've seen people
transform their normal their normal
state bodies into like something I've
never seen before and it's so fake and
it's so much you know catfish Photoshop
in moderation like you know artistic
improvement enhancement not
transformation you don't get to be a
whole new person on Photoshop alongside
that is the hip breaking angles we get
it we want to put our best foot forward
we want our body to look nice but do not
dislocate a hip in the process if you
break your back and you do all of this
yes you get to look like Kylie Jenner
but you also look constipated
be careful because you think you look
cute no you look like you've got
something stuck up your wrist and oh god
everybody hope you're not triggered I'm
really hope you're not triggered do you
know what we need to leave we need to
leave dangerous clickbait I don't want
to see anything that involves flames
fire blood knives and scissors all in
the name of our seeing a makeup tutorial
you're doing the most this was the year
on Instagram of a lot of click baked and
I have a problem cook bake like I get it
you want people to watch your content
but when it is dangerous
like why is there a flame New York
eyebrow that doesn't look like fun that
doesn't look like a joke that looks like
you ending up in the air
please let us let it go no more flames
no more knives no more scissors so
nothing dangerous okay I like my funny
faces I love it
nothing dangerous this is a personal
preference this is just my thing and I
think this actually being a perpetrator
but it is a wearing obnoxious contacts
some of these contacts you literally
look like a lizard I'm scared I'm
triggered I see you and I feel like I
can see into your soul I'm not saying
any particular tone or any particular
person or any particular race I just
feel like everyone is wearing these
literal ice white contacts I feel like
I'm looking into the soul of a Dementor
I don't know what it is I'm scared I
love contacts and I get the idea of you
know changing the way you look making
your makeup pop a little bit more and
it's more so a fashion look but I find
it scary I think it's nice to wait for
like Halloween or something but find the
contacts that are gonna shoot okay guys
I am done I am done I feel like I just
let off a little steam I don't get it
twisted I am a perpetrator of 90 billion
of the stuff on the air yeah I've done
it and I'm not even saying that I'm not
gonna do it anymore I'm even gonna say
that right but these are just some of
the things that would be nice to like
you know leave in the past and the one
thing I have said I noticed a lot on
Instagram recently that I've been seeing
a lot more beauty in variety and I feel
like you can always find something that
is to your taste
including style fashion makeup
everything you can find so if you are
tricking and if you don't like something
including myself there's something out
there for everyone I do not want anyone
to be attacked
I don't want anyone to feel like I was
talking about them probably I'm
definitely not I'm just talking about
myself and things I see I bet there are
some things that you wanna like get off
in the comments so feel free to do that
but in the meantime I will catch you
later
maybe tomorrow thanks for watching guys
bye
