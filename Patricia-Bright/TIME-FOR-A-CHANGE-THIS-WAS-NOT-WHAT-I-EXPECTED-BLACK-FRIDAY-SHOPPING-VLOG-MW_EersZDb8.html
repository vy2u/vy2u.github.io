doing welcome to another vlog I'm trying
to be good as per usual and blog
regularly I think for like brightness
vlogmas I'm gonna be doing a video so
you can be part of my everyday life
basically every single week today is
just a casual day I'll be honest with
you I feel like I say this all the time
I'm getting my ish in order like I'll
get my stuff in order I'll just clean up
the kitchen at my front room it's
finally it's basically been a storage
room I cleared out my closet go go I
want to take you into my garage in a
second because you're gonna see hold on
I need to make myself a tea and then
we'll have a proper chat I am currently
living for peanut butter but if you
don't know most peanut butter actually
has sugar in it
I buy this on phone wait Rose I don't
know if it's called whole earth or not
but this is crunchy peanut butter always
crunchy never smooth never smooth
property slice a chose peanut butter and
I am now I'm not even me though because
it's necessary it's pretty required this
one is from my vitamin not sponsored or
anything I just like good vitamins and
they're actually really affordable and
you can get them online I'm gonna even
try and buy some for Black Friday
because I bet they'll have offers bonds
so I'm saying I've been on a massive
like sorting out tip cleared out my
closet cleared up my front room which
basically has been a go-to room for all
the junk or all the parcels and all the
stuff it's not been nice because we
moved in in February like it's quite
hard to make a house at home especially
if you don't take the time to do it but
at least we have a bear front room I'm
still packing stuff into the garage but
if I show you guys how
stuff them is actually part of it's a
little bit embarrassing and I'll be
honest I'm so proud and I'm so happy to
you know be able to do what I do
sometimes it's a lot like it is a lot
but today is all about getting my ish on
all done when you see me with like a
headband or hats on it's because my hair
is not made and it just isn't it isn't
trying to listen to me so yeah guys we

called Korea food you can separate out
all your vegetables your parrots
whatever and I eat vegetables every
single day I love vegetables and I just
put a bit of lemon and a little bit of
salt to kind of just help with the
preservation but it doesn't go off or
anything it's actually fine last
probably about five days I mean we've
been eating plenty of these these this
week so have a look so these are already
done but basically I live my life eating
