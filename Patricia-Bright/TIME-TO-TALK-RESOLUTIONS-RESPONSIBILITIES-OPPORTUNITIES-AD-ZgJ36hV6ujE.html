Happy New Year
this is my first video of the year and I
wanted to make it a poignant one and one
that was quite truthful to where I
company and in my life and I've also
been challenged by booking.com
to make reservations and not resolutions
and when I heard that it genuinely made
me really reflect on myself and the new
challenges that I will be facing all the
new opportunities I'll be facing in the
new year and for those of you who don't
know I am with childhood I shall be
having a baby girl in the next three or
so months
ish and it is the most exciting thing
ever the most I mean it's something that
I have thought of but never could see
happening or when it's really happening
you're like oh gosh this is really about
to happen and I'm excited I'm ecstatic
I'm happy I'm so in love but in the same
breath I won't like that I have felt
fears and I have felt concerns I think
one of the biggest concerns that I felt
was like this is gonna change my life
and I used to be super adventurous and
spontaneous and that oh no there's
responsibility and I can't do that and I
realize I kind of had to check myself
reality is and if this applies to not
just having a baby but lots of different
things the reality is that having a
responsibility is not a limitation it's
an addition and it's a blessing and it's
a challenge and challenges make you grow
and be a better you and I rely really
realized that I had to change my mindset
and be that you know what having a baby
is the biggest blessing and amazing
change that's gonna happen in my life
and it's not gonna be something that's
going to limit me so you know I'm saying
at the beginning of the year I'm
declaring it at the beginning of the
year I'm going to go on a trip with my
husband with my baby it's gonna be the
best trip ever it's going to be
something that allows me to still be
myself to still be spontaneous but also
to be that mother who makes the choice
to be Who I am while being a loving
eternal person so I used the booking.com
person basically you type in your
resolutions and then it gives you a
suggestions of locations and beautiful
places to stay and for me it's just
great to get that inspiration and I've
decided that I will be having a trip of
a lifetime this year along with the
little one and along with my husband and
I'm going to have the mentality and the
thought and the desire and make the
effort make the step take the goal to do
something creative do something
spontaneous go somewhere beautiful and
enjoy the experience as a family that
has grown and I just kind of wanted to
inspire some of you guys whom it might
not be a baby it might be a new job it
might be going to school going to
college it might be a loss in the family
it might be lots of different things
that you think could stop you or could
limit you but I've come to thinking that
responsibility doesn't mean that you
lose yourself or it's a bad thing
responsibility is opportunity for growth
and development so those are my thoughts
at the beginning of the year guys and
I'm really excited and I'm gonna remain
me like that's one of the key things
that I really want to push out of this
is just remaining myself and I would
love to hear from other women out there
who maybe have had you know changes in
their life how they dealt with it any
suggestions of places to go that would
be really good as well so that's my
musings for today but I really hope you
enjoyed and have an amazing new year so
guys thanks for watching and I'll see
you later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
