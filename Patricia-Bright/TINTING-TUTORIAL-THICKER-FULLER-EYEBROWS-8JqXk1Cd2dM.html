to get darker eyebrows and get that
doing your own eyebrow dying or tinting
now I used to get it done at benefit and
I think I was paying 15 quid to do it
and get it works and everything but I
found this kit this kit in Boots for 8
pounds and it literally does exactly
what I was paying 15 pounds to do a
benefit and it's an eyelash so if you've
got a blonde eyelashes or quite light
eyelashes and you don't really want it
it's you can use it on your eyelashes
and you can use it in your brows to
darken them and when you darken your
brows it kind of frames your face a lot
more and gives you the illusion of that
I don't know it just makes your eyes
look more filled in and if you're
someone who feels in your eyebrows this
it and you feel it in regularly or your
very fine eyebrows this is a really good
technique so I've done my own if you can
tell they look a lot thicker and they
are filled in a little bit but not as
much so I would usually have to do it
because this really looks good so I hope
you enjoy this really you don't really
need any additional equipment this is
the kit once again which I bought from
Boop's always read your instructions
however I found that these extractions
well you are good in terms of the mixing
but in terms of anything else
yeah you told me to leave on my eyebrow
for two minutes and yeah I needed to
leave on for 10 so all you need to do is
take two centimeters worth two
centimeters
and it said and it start off with two
drops but that was three four five and
this thing is very annoying to turn so
you've got the one with the the pin one
and I'll just use that one so I added a
few more drops and it will start to
break up and it will never get into a
proper pace well that's what I think
anyway you can kind of whisk it like
you're whisking an egg I find that helps
so that seems mixed enough to me and it
will have a few bits in it but yeah
doesn't matter
so you guys this is early morning face
you can kind of see that this brow I did
last night so I'll show you what I just
know I used the stick as well really
thickly on trying to as neat as possible
the shape that you want your brow to be
just because it kind of dies the area
around you don't new mammoths Wow
so I'm gonna get a piece of tissue and
just wipe around and I'm gonna leave it
now for the next ten minutes we'll see
how those I mean it's been ten minutes
and I'm just going to use a cotton bud
and you to just wipe it off I might just
do the universe and see whether or not
the color speak so well i you can see my
eyebrows look a lot darker and it really
will frame my face I'm gonna go and
pluck my eyebrows now and yeah although
this one looks darker if I did this one
twice but yeah and I can do it you can
do it again if you want to I wouldn't
advise doing it all the time because
there is no upside in it like hair dye
and do do a skin test first and I look
gross so I'm going to get the camera hi
