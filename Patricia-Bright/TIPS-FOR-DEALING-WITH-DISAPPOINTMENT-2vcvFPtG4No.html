so today I thought I would do another
motivational moment and I want you guys
to know I'm very like it sounds really
bad but very emotionally driven and I
talk or I do my videos a lot from how
I'm feeling at that point in time and
like it just comes in my head and I'm
like you know I've got to record this
I've got to film this I really wanted to
talk today about dealing with
disappointment now and this is really
base for those and I think it's like
everyone because I'm someone who used to
deal with disappointment very bad and I
say used to like two weeks ago three
weeks ago and I realized that I would
get very very disappointed if things
didn't go the way that they went to go I
would get very frustrated I could get
very upset very emotional very anxious
as well as if things were going to plan
because I'm someone who's not I'm a
little bit like a rightness a tip - off
I plan everything meticulously and
sometimes in life you know things are
not going to go that way and I would be
you know with dread if things didn't go
the way I planned and I just got to this
point in what timewise I said you can't
deal with things in this way anymore
like you can't allow things not going to
plan affect you in such a negative way I
was like like how do you actually deal
with disappointment so got some tips
here which I hope are useful so number
one I think you need to have your moment
there's gonna be that moment where
you're going to want to scream like
you're gonna want to scream you're going
to be frustrated you might want to crime
have your moment there and except right
this is what has happened this is what I
wanted and this is what I got
there's a lot of people who repress that
moment just have that moment
don't let it extend but back have that
scream if that's what you really need to
do number two is assess that situation
and say it out so you know what saying
it out means saying this is what I
wanted but this is actually what I got I
wanted to pass my driving test but I
felt I wanted to get into that school
but I haven't got to
school I wanted that job but I didn't
get that job that just say the situation
sometimes I've been the kind of person
where I think of the worst case scenario
every time I can't think oh well maybe
it'll be okay I would be like this is
devastating and this is the worst thing
that could have happened but if I didn't
get a job it'll be like I'm never ever
ever gonna have a job I'm gonna be a bob
I'm gonna be homeless oh my god I'm
gonna be eating chips and that is how I
would think ravening or maybe their next
one's for me I got to this place where I
got you know what rather than you only
focusing on the negative and indulge
yourself for a moment Patricia think of
the negative and also think of it up the
scale so from the worst case scenario a
bad scenario a medium scenario a good
scenario an amazing scenario so the
amazing scenario saying that job example
is I get you know I didn't get that job
but Goldman Sachs call me as I could
true so we want you to start tomorrow
let's best scenarios I do another
interview I do really well and I get
that job I want you to scale it like
that it really makes you think actually
it makes you put things into perspective
and actually think the likelihood is
that the medium case scenario or even
you know the a good scenario is actually
what you could achieve so the next thing
is I say take a deep breath and make a
choice decide what scenario you're
actually going to allow to be your
destiny are you gonna allow the
worst-case scenario and sit into a pit
of despair and worry and frustration
that isn't going to get you anywhere or
you're going to stand up and just say
you know what maybe I'm gonna just try
for the medium scenario or do you know
what I'm gonna wait for the best
scenario to happen but you need to
decide there and then what is it that
you're going to do so once you've made
that decision it's time to pick yourself
up and it's time to make the move if you
determine the outcomes may say there's
five outcomes you pick outcome number
three or number four work for it know
that it's going
take your action and it's going to take
you standing up to actually get that
outcome and it will definitely happen
you need to recognize that
disappointments going to happen again
and that was the key thing that I've
learned is that in life
disappointments happen things will go
wrong not not everything's going to go
as you planned
sometimes that list you wrote we Eve
wrote in the air and say goodbye list
because that is just how life goes I
would finally say enjoy the process that
is life and you don't realize that
actually when you've been down and those
disappointments have actually set you up
for something better something that
improves your life something that even
if it doesn't improve your life it's
something that propels you to better if
even if it's that fear that stops you
from allowing yourself to be in that
situation again that disappointment is a
platform or springboard to something
better so guys that's my motivational
moment I was really like I go into like
preach remove it when I met speaking
from my heart I hope you guys don't mind
but you know I said I'm going to do
these more regularly so leave any
comments below and any other topics you
want me to talk about I don't want to do
a fun one next which is going to be like
how not to get approached by guys but I
don't know anything you want me to do
just leave it in the bottom and I'll do
that so thanks for watching guys and
I'll see you later bye
