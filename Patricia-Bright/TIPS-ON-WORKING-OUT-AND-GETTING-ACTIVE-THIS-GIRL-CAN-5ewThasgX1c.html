today's video has been entirely inspired
by the disco can campaign I'm not sure
if you guys have seen it but I
absolutely love that ad is the ad with
the Missy Elliott beat didn't dinner no
no no and it's got all the ladies who
are of different shapes and sizes and
ethnicities getting active is so
inspirational and I basically found out
that this came about because there was
research to show that 2 million less
women worked out than men based on the
fear of being judged or being worried
about their appearance and I'm sure
there were other factors that had an
impact but for someone like me who is
all about God power I thought that that
was you know quite a sad thing to hear
so I wanted to do a video today where I
basically you know it lightly tell you
guys about you know some of my
experiences and the tips that I would do
to make sure that I don't allow things
like that to be a barrier to me working
out or getting fit they also have this
really cool app where you can upload a
photo say after you've worked out or
something and they have these really
cool slogans that women have been using
and I use damn right I look hot and I
just think it's really cool to just
share and be part of the movement that's
happening I'll link the app in the
description bar below so you guys can
get your hands on it but in the meantime
I hope you enjoyed this video so my
first tip is not to worry about trying
something new I know what it's like when
you haven't done something before and
you're a bit worried about going to a
class or something because you don't
know who's going to be there you don't
know if you're gonna be any good it can
be really really scary I remember when I
wanted to start doing kickboxing when I
was in university and I basically knew
that you know I'm not gonna be that good
a lot of people said to me you know I
was very skinny back in the day and
people would say oh you're quite flimsy
Patricia why would you do kickboxing why
don't you go and do aerobics or
something you know a bit more girly and
I think no I'm gonna do kickboxing and I
remember
a bit worried about showing up or going
to the class and I almost didn't want to
go so I was really scared to go but I
ended up going and absolutely loving it
I was worried about being the only woman
in the class not being very good in the
class and I know it can be extra scary
if you're doing something on your own so
I went with my friend to the class and I
ended up having a really good time
another fear that people have is not
being good at something or not having
the stamina for something but everyone
has to start from somewhere you don't
just start off being great at you know
working out or lifting weights or
something like that so for me I'm not
that good at running say I go jogging
and all that kind of things because I
always get like burning a burning
sensation in my legs and stuff like that
and so I remember when I wanted to go to
like a spin class and being really
worried that oh my gosh I'm not gonna be
able to keep up with the class like that
but I remember that I ended up really
loving the spinning and actually when I
spin I didn't get in the burning it was
only when I ran outside or on a
treadmill something to do with the
movement or something don't let the fear
of what you look like
stopped you from doing something you
know I'm makeup and hair and all kinds
of stuff most of the time but this girl
can do it then any girl can definitely
do it people are working out they
couldn't care less about what the other
person next to him looks like they're
probably caring about holding their
position or their posture or doing that
next rep and that I understand that some
of us might be uncomfortable but usually
the more you exercise and the more you
work out with them or you go to the gym
the more you kind of get used to being
in that environment and being
comfortable with it finally if you do
want some tips for staying fresh and
looking good in the gym I'm gonna give
you a couple of my tips so a CC cream if
you might have bad skin or you don't
really like wearing no foundation I
understand a CC cream is nice and light
and it's great even if you're sweating
number two a lip balm because nobody
likes dry chapped lips at any point in
time okay number three is have those
eyebrows on fleek don't mess around with
them if you can brush them or fill them
in or make them neat they're not gonna
rub off if you're feeling a little bit
wedding and for your gym wear make sure
you feel good in it make sure you feel
comfortable in it
be it you know a pair of shorts awesome
yoga pants whatever you feel comfortable
in is gonna be a good look for you so
this was inspired by than this cocaine
campaign it was really enjoyable to find
out more about it and you guys should
definitely check it out I will link the
app and everything in the description
bar below so thank you for watching bye
guys
