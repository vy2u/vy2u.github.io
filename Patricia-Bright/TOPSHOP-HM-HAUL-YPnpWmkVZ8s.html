video is going to be another haul video
so that keep doing hauls I had a few
issues with my computer and stuff like
that so I was going to do the halls and
I like calls anyway so this is mainly
from Topshop and from H&amp;amp;M and yeah just
got a few bits extra bits for spring so
I'm loving shorts right now and I bought
these really cute like swingy shorts
which are really pretty and I'm in a
really nice white I've been running
white shorts or like really soft shorts
for a really really long time so I found
these these are 12 pounds I'm not sure I
wouldn't with it and but I'm working out
so continuing with the shorts but you
also bought a pair of denim cutoffs well
hot pants again
each these are not that sure but I
really like them because the way that
they were made if you have a look at the
back what it's done it fits my shape
perfectly because I have quite a small
waist and a bigger behind and it fits so
it's the gaping there's not as much
gaping as there is with other
high-waisted shorts these fit really
well and they're not to try either so I
bought this gorgeous suede and camel
skirt swaggy
camel skirt and you can see the panels
and I thought this is really nice
because people keep asking me to do this
whole color blocking trend and it's okay
but I don't like primary colors on me
90% of the time I'm in camel cream and
whites and pinks and stuff like that
because that's what I think suits me and
what I like but I thought this could be
really nice you know with a brighter
color topper from H&amp;amp;M I also picked up
some Blazers and I need to stop with the
Blazers like my collection is getting
massive but I love them I love them
so I got this gorgeous caramel-colored
blazer again just look up you won't see
the inside but look how smart the inside
looks and this is gorgeous it's really
smart so in the elegant it's very
European you know Italian and French
that's just my style and yeah let me
show you though this is actually a new
top as well so this is a really rocky
rocky kind of tassel top along with this
smart jacket but look it already that
you've kind of transformed
the low love this jacket is just so cute
and I don't know professional-looking
and like the sleeves as well so I also
got another blazer as well which is from
H&amp;amp;M still and I've wanted a white blazer
for ages and ages but then I tried some
white ones on and they just look so
sharp so no I don't like it and then I
have this like off peachy creamy blazer
which looks really expensive it was only
20 pounds and it's kind of cropped I
like the way the sleeves make at the
back and I said oh my gosh that is
amazing so that's really pretty as well
looks great with this outfit see it's
just really cute you know even with a
Rakhi t-shirt it works
wonderful so I've got a few extra bits
and bobs from Topshop I finally
succumbed to buying the scalloped top
and it's in a gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
like pinky peach color and love this
color
I'm not that impressed by the shape of
the top at all not impressed at all I
love the softness of the fabric but it's
it's so baggy it but it looks great when
you tuck it in the hole high-waisted
skirt or shorts and put a belt on it so
you really need a belt to transform the
shape of this outfit I also bought some
basics I bought a black vest and a white
vest and these are gorgeously fitting
vests they're nice soft soft cotton and
it's 2 4 10 pounds and you always need
these in your wardrobe
so continuing with the scallop turned I
bought one of these and tops is a
cropped pan up top and it's got you know
the scalloped detailing on the sleeves
and also on the Conner
hope you can see that and it's in the
gorgeous color and fabric it's not
really my user style it looks very
preppy however I want to rock it and see
what I think of it and finally I bought
this gorgeous rasca can you see that I
just love the fabric I love the way it
looks like it moves and finally I picked
up this gorgeous bag from Aldo
it's just amazing it's so pretty it
looks really expensive without looking
cheap at the same time you know I mean I
just love the color and you know the
whole kind of blocking trend some is
common in farming colors I don't really
wear them on my on my body but I will
definitely rock it in an accessory
inspiration accessing their looks as
good as this they have these in like
white and black with white and like
beige really really gorgeous but I think
of you know the wear if this gets a bit
dirty and stuff like that it's still
gonna look pretty it's still gonna look
elegant and I just love it I'll show you
this especially looking with this
teacher so guys that is the end of my
home video I have a boyfriend haul video
but I want you to request it if you want
me to see if you want to see what I've
got him then just say yeah we would like
to see cuz I don't see the point in me
putting up and that video if it's not
really gonna be helpful but I'll do what
my boyfriend or Michael's fashion sent
in another video he's gonna actually
cost me for doing this book yeah yes see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
