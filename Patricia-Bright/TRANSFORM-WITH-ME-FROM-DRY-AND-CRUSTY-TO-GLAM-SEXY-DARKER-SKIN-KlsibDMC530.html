channel I'm about to beat my face glam
because I feel like it please do not
look at my extremely overly moisturizer
lips I have been dealing with such dry
lips recently I don't know what's going
on I've got really dry scalp just I'm
dry from the inside out I'm seeing a
dermatologist at you have a doctor's
appointment as well like I don't know
what's going on it's not being great so
I'm just leaving myself open up I just
get a bit glam you can then we'll show
you my voice it also sounds dry just
everything party like what is this
but yeah don't worry which I will
survive I am going to moisturize recipe
firstly with the Illamasqua hydra veil a
really nice moisturizing partner I'm so
dry I need this it's a really good
moisturizing primer but stops you from
being oily my brows listen they have
been struggle it's okay I've got my
Loreal brow shaper to help them out and
think I'm getting their mic related
anyway but for now this pencil is the
bomb and I will keep using it also going
to use the anastasia dipbrow pomade just
too great a couple more nice natural
strokes they look kind of one right now
until that's what my concealer want them
and then they will be very nice I'm
going in with the pro HB long-wear this
is a really a fortunate concealer no
light it's sick
like it's actually that good I think
about four pounds can pick this up in
superdrug
my sister insults my eyebrows recently
and ever since then I have just been
making sure that they always look extra
freaky and they take me at least 10
minutes now going in with my foundation
if the land content the dull color
setting this foundation is everything
right literally is
thing I've been around since 2013 and it
hasn't ended right thing is I'm going to
man I'm going in with Mac's Sato car
it's actually the first time I've ever
used it I've been watching certainly
tutorials and I just love it
okay so some crazy reason I didn't
explain what I was doing here I
basically went in at my crease with a
dark brown and then I followed that up
with an orange and then I went in with
this color here which is from Max just
to give me a little bit more definition
and color I'm going to use this creamy
eyeliner from Kiko to give my eyes apart
I'm going to use the super liner from
L'Oreal and honestly I think my throat
was just so dry I just was like I'm
going to talk through this video so I
went ahead and lined my eyes and
followed up with I believe that is
another L'Oreal mascara a really good
one that I use quite regularly and then
my lashes are quite glam these are from
below lashes an oldie but a goodie next
I tried this gold eye pencil into my
inner crease and this is from Clarins
it's really creamy and warm and loved it
and then after that I went in with the
HD concealer and I just blended that
under my eyes and I did it quite heavy
because I just wanted to be extra glam
okay so I'm using the multi contour
sticks from Mac I use this all the time
this stick is so better I love it like
contouring so next I'm setting with my
Sascha powder as per usual and I decided
that I was going to just take a little
extra hard this time around because that
one it's a glam and yeah you can see
what I like to offer that baked set hard
and then I go in with my blush I think
this is matte fever but I write all the
product details in the description bar
below
and then I'm using this liner from
bareMinerals they've got they're kind of
neutrals collection and this is a really
nice pink that I use as a base
underneath and I went in with this gloss
also from bareMinerals I'm telling you
this gloss is so good and then I lie and
weave I think it's a bittersweet on the
outside I use the Ora highlight palette
from Anastasia and let people talking
down about this but honestly it is
gorgeous I love it okay guys glam look
all done I put myself on a little sexy
white dress my for very glam right about
now let me show you the dress con here
we go this is a little misguided Pete I
am working on the pooch it will get
better very soon but I love the
shoulders on this and literally all
dressed up and nowhere to go I don't
know if you guys ever do about that
you put your whole face bone your hair
down you're like am I actually going to
go so I'm just going to call a couple of
friends and maybe see if there's
anything we can do or I'm just going to
embrace and enjoy this look for myself
because actually I'm feeling a bit more
just before I put this face on and the
more makeup I was putting on anger I
feel alright now crazy our makeup can
just change from in front moment what I
do so like um one of those girls that I
don't change a lot with makeup like I
would love to have one of those faces a
transform and I've got so much makeup on
to look like I've transformed but I feel
like today at almost almost got there
what you guys think let me know in the
comments and in the meantime I will see
you later
