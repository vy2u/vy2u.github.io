video is going to be on accessories
trends and usually these are oversized
and I really feel like accessories or
the new way of kind of showing who you
are going to show you how I kind of
where a few different bits and bobs and
I hope you enjoy this video so the first
item we have is the oversized clutch and
I got this clutch from Topshop it's
actually from one of their concessions
and they're great for a night out
because you can actually fit more than a
lipstick in it and you can get loads of
different designs you can even make one
yourself I might do a video on how to
make it next an oversized clutch if you
want to and this one's kind of got a
patting one on the front I really cool
pattern on the front and kind of like
snakeskin on the back so guys this is
the next trend I'm loving it's all part
of the oversized accessories and it's
the oversized scarf / poncho and this is
from H&amp;amp;M and I give you a good look at
what it looks like it's literally a big
square with a hole cut out of it and I
love this and even for now so you know
at night you can kind of throw this on
over an outfit and even come winter this
is going to be my staple and you can
kind of twist it all around and wear it
in multiple different ways
polyvinyl wanted i'ma go with so guys
this is my all-time favorite accessory
piece and it's the jewelry grace all
kind of jewelry for your back now
accessories are really becoming this new
kind of statement and I really think
that this is one of these that make a
statement especially if you're into the
whole masculine trend as well kind of
you think I'm wearing a brace right now
it's a very strange kind of piece of
jewelry and then I turn around like this
piece here is from Topshop and it's a
great accessory that I think actually
encompasses a lot of different
accessories trends that are out there at
the moment one it's got the feathers
feathers we're loving right now or I'm
loving right now and it's just a really
really cool look it's also got the metal
bits as well that added a bit of hard
edge rockiness to it and it's also
oversized so this is like three trends
all in one which I really not so I've
wear this with you know a jump to or
something all black this will really
allow the piece to speak for itself of
its lovely accents that add to this
outfit
yeah but we're never gonna break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
