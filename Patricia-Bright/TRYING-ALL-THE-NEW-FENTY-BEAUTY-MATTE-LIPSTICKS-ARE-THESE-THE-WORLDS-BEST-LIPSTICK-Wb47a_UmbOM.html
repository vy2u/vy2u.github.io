I'm excited as I always am because I'm
about to try that new new hey I know I
know I'm here sitting with my lips that
look so an allergy right now I've not
just forgot my Vaseline there is a
reason to this I'm about to swap the new
lipsticks in from Fenty beauty these are
called the matte Mozilla's and I saw
them all of it Instagram and I was
really really excited I saw the ad I was
like oh my gosh I cannot wait to try
these out
I was literally so excited at the idea
of being able to try these out and I'm
not gonna lie I saw some shades that I
was like this isn't gonna work on me
like I too like this some greens some
oranges some bluey shades but in the
same time I'm like you know what it's
okay to have fun so I'm gonna have fun
and see what I look like with these on
but there's some great news and beiges
and pinky colors that are way more up my
street so I believe there are 15 shades
and these are priced at oh they're $18
ok $18 I think don't think that it's too
expensive for lippy so gonna open these
up and I'm gonna share with you and show
you what I think as you can see I have
all of the shades crazy by absolutely
not I've got all of the shade and I'm
just gonna go ahead and swatch and I'm

can we just say shout out to the
packaging how gorgeous is this gonna
look in the collection my oh I swear
nowadays they make makeup just so it
looks nice like this is so pretty right
the first shade that I'm gonna try out
is called one of the boys Oh
okay this shade here is called one of
the boys and I love the little detail
just on the tip just like that so it's a
matte but it feels quite creamy going on
I mean it's so interesting when Browns
come out with shades like this like
where do you think we're going it feels
really nice on it's a matte lip but it's
creamy it's it's smooth it is not drying
and I feel like it will come off like a
dream but Patricia we're like where
would you go with this this is great for
like Instagram take your Instagram photo
you know I'm an artiste with my kind of
past early baby sick purple lips what I
will say in barracks a matte lip it came
off with beautifully it isn't one of
those drying matte lips and that's so
important like we don't need to have
scaly lips and not a good look okay this
is called candy venom whoa it's a
vibrant it's a vibrant pink over here
this is candy venom really really pink
see what this looks like on honestly
sometimes I'm really scared of these
colors and I'm not using a lip liner
because I wanted to keep it as true as
possible oh that's kind of fresh you
know the level of payoff on this is so
real
hide your wife hide your kids and I'm
coming to town with this luminous pink
lippy this is your tree fluorescent you
need sunglasses to look at me do I like
it yes I just feel like it makes my
chocolate pop even more I'm really
excited for summer this is what this
makes me excited for but you know you
have your balance between African aunty
and you know cutting edge of fashion
think you might just be leaning -
cutting edge of fashion
okay the next street is called PMS all I
know that this is looking like a very
licked Brown look at the nub of beauty
on that shade just look at that yeah
it's a lot darker than I thought it
would be I'm free payoff yes now I look
expensive this is fantastic look at the
shade don't take the piss the is
beautiful can you imagine just one
little lip highlight right there I just
need a faux fur jacket I need a little
dog and I um there's back those this
should be called bougie Brown Eugene
brown you know I'm gonna do a lip shade
called bougie bones go take it from me
Rihanna don't take it from me I'm in
shock at how fantastic that shade is
okay what do we have next
Mar damn I love the naming okay Mar damn
this is looking like a kind of darker
red a darker red to stunner it's just
wrong with this one
oh I just caught myself in the
reflection my dad oh come on
I had this more than stunner ma damn
just crazy I haven't felt like I needed
a lipliner with any of these colors
which is rare for me ma damn girl
okay this shade is called spanked that's
a little racy fenty it's a little racy
this isn't really the kind of pink I'd
go for because it's like a pinky red but
let's see what it looks like on yeah
this looks on T on me and I look like
I've got a beard and the thing is a
certain shade that as soon as I see them
I like no they're not gonna be for me
Spanx you're not for me
I do look like the auntie who forgot her
liner got carried away went to like
LaMarcus Prentiss or Debenhams to buy
makeup and the lady at the till did her
makeup that is what this looks like on
me you got to know your shades you've
got to know your shade pinks that are
too dark no this is exciting
okay this shade is called me tonight
wasabi
and actually quite nervous cuz it's a
green it's not green you know it's kind
of a cute green though it's not like
green it's like this is what this looks
like up close if you know I'm saying
like it isn't the worst kind of green
nice green moss creams don't know if
this should be on lips though but let's
see
okay I can't decide I can't decide I
mean will I be getting on the London
Underground with this you know right but
it is a bad look no you guys you have to
tell me in the comments what you guys
think like if you like you okay maybe it
looks very cool there let's kind of arty
stick maybe in springtime when like the
leaves are forming again you might want
to not for me on an everyday basis but
what I've got to say is that I cannot
get over how are these matte lipsticks
feel so I'm down for that
the green right now you guys decide
I love love love the name of this shade
it is called clap back clap back look at
that gorgeous Navy no this is rude this
is so rude because it is so good and at
the point I have to make is that the
shape of these are really good in terms
of they're quite small and the angle is
great for just getting nice detail it's
a really really good shape and just look
at that color honestly it's so nice who
would have thought who would have
thought like look overall I could just
come up here do my video in my blue lips
and just be like hey clap back I'm
feeling this this is fabulous this is
called yadi yadi egg oh definitely a
blue but more like a violet kind of
shade of blue right about now my lips
are feeling it's hot sauce so I'm gonna
go over my dear lip glue just
just to give me a little bomb this is my
favorite band of all time good god no
this is similar to the first shade this
is a hundred a hundred percent it's a no
yes or no a blue shade like this is
gonna make your teeth look so yellow
this comes on my under my category of
baby sick
no this shade is called up to no good
and I feel like we're getting into the
territory of looks bad on Patricia it is
what I call just that kind of peachy
color which is great you know not every
economist for you but I could be proven
wrong
there were just some shades on the
spectrum that are not meant for me you
know not every shade is for us some
shades of Anil POIs zero points no yeah
the funny thing is basically this really
does give me k'kaw vibes
k'kaw beauty every shade was there which
is why it was such a fail okay a shade
it's not for me as it I take this off
and like I've got the worst case of dry
lips you've ever seen Oh God
we've got another dark brown shade here
this shade is called Griselda I love
that name
I love the name grows older I think I've
met one girl cooled that in my whole
life and I was like well that's such a
cool name but I like older name it's a
dark it's a sexy reminding me of the
shade PMS if we got Griselda up close
and personal
I'm excited about this shade the darker
the berry the sweeter the juice the dark
shades are fabulous did not disappoint
crews out
okay so Cassandra and PMS are very very
different
Griselda is absolutely gorgeous I feel
like I need to line the bow for some
reason I feel like it was just Messier
maybe because I've already swatch like
nine lipsticks and it's just gonna get a
little bit you know imperfect but the
shade is gorgeous so what I killed jaar
jaar jaar Red John at arts art like
blood red really really nice and the PMS
is more like a brown but this is hot
fire this is hot Freya and so next up is
this shape could freckle Fiesta we'll
just name and love it and it's an it's
an orangey but it's a weird orange it's
like an a real real orange but not like
an orange red it's just orange it's
actually pretty up then I thought it
would be because I did see this on some
of the advertising and I was like no
honey
okay okay okay Franco's for yes it is
again a weird one I like him I think I
think Elena would make this look better
but it doesn't look as awful as I
thought it was going to look on me this
would be really nice in the summer and
actually I think it makes my melanin
papas were hot I'm okay I'm turning I
like it I've got a special occasion and
I want to let people know I've arrived
and this is the kind of shade that I
would wear okay so I just thought that
the shade that I'll use was a true
orange not on that is more of a muted
Orange this shade here is called saucy
saucy love it this is a bright orange
look at the levels of orange on that I
wonder what I'm gonna look like with
that on saucy saucy I like that
that's a real orange I don't have up
this me why do I like this
I love / hate it it just really pops it
I love the way it pots there's so
pigmented I just love the weights
pigmented I really love that I'm Safi
turned into a tip-top see ya do you know
I like about these I feel like it makes
my color pop more like it doesn't wash
me out it just makes me look even more
like rich you know rich in color rich in
color rich in life you know that's
really important but I think that this
would suit so many skin tones I could
see someone look it was really pale and
this orange would just complement them I
amazingly I cannot wait for 2080 and I
feel like colors about to just come back
into our lives
I'm so excited okay the next shade oh it
is cool single single and ready to
mingle I am not single but if it was
maybe this shape would bring me a man is
that the principle I don't know I think
this is going to bring me old a
pensioner because I can tell it's a
shade that just might not look good on
me but you never know you know you may
never know this is this shade up close
as you can see it's that kind of kind of
that in the middle pink that doesn't
usually suit me it looks good on my
bottom lip
ittsan now I tell you there's this this
shade of pink I know that doesn't look
good on me if I was single and I was
looking for a man wearing this I would
be single for very long very very long
okay this is the final shade of all of
the shades of 14 shades and it's called
shortie with a W oh this is gonna be
cute I'm glad shorty looks like another
dark red let us roll go shorty it's your
birthday we're gonna party like it's
your birthday
mm I'm a bit taken aback by this because
it looks a bit like a poo Brown
or SMUD is that you have to find the
right tone for you this is the kind of
brown I don't even know how to call it
smarter orangey browny ready Ricky Ricky
ready brown and it looks more like a poo
brown on me doesn't suit me doesn't suit
me these I know these shades they don't
shoot me
well you know what we've got PMS and
we've got Griselda that are beautiful so
you know I don't need you shorty I don't
need you
you will not define me okay guys that is
it that is nice watching this video I
had to put on my favorite color at the
end just so you guys remember how
fantastic this shade was all in all I
believe they were 14 shades it might be
15 but I've got 14 in front of me and
I've got to say out of all 14 I thought
they were 1 2 3 4 5 that I really really
loved and right now need to be in my
permanent regular collection which no
surprise was the PMS the Grizelda clap
back this color which is Mademoiselle
and actually candy venom which was which
is the really bright pink and then I
have another product that are more or
less like on the bench so these are if I
was trying to be a little bit more
creative but I know they would look good
on me and then I have four that I would
just like it's a nail pot for me if zero
points we don't like you which include
that the toothpaste shade and the
lighter balloons could you dig so over
all right there are a great selection of
shades I did for like the darker ones
for my skin tone were more suitable for
like actual where I think all of them
would look amazing on Instagram in
videos and pictures but walking down on
nice treat you might scare people but
overall I must say fun and they're very
very good quality they feel great on my
lips and I know that I have lips watched
in the past or my lips feel red war and
they feel great they feel wonderful they
are not a drying formula so if you can
find at least
two to three shades I think you'll be
good it would be nice to have a lineup
just to make it be a bit easier to use
but the shape was really good to kind of
help with that but overall there's at
least five shades absolutely love $18 I
think is a great price because this is
really a higher-end Brandes be real when
it comes to Fanta beauty and I can't
wait to see what else is going to come
through from Fendi beauty because this
kid guys I'm quickly back because I
decided to do a word test it's Christmas
Day today hey everyone is upstairs and I
just want out quickly just drop this bit
in cuz i watch my videos that oh you
know actually tell you guys how i felt
about how it were how it wore so I worry
all of yesterday and I love the way the
color stayed in last really long very
very comfortable but what I will say is
it definitely transfer so it's not like
a matte lip where you touch your lips
and you know there isn't any transfer it
transfers what's giving my little kisses
and her face was like covered in the PEP
but you know the color still stays on
your lips ting you look gorgeous but yet
it's not a matte lip that doesn't
transfer but it feels really great a lot
of really good and I wore it enough
today
so yeah I will force I hope you're
having a lovely Christmas time and I
will see you probably tomorrow because I
might have another video thanks watching
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
