today I'm about to do a full face of a
zorse makeup isn't that random did you
guys even know that Jesus had makeup I
did not I did I got a press release
about it like a couple of months ago but
I hadn't really been in the market for
like going to look on to either so you
know what their makeup was saying but
now I feel like everyone is releasing
makeup fashion / have makeup pretty
little things have makeup every everyone
is literally selling makeup now it's
actually insane but yes I might I might
try them all out we'll see what I wanted
to do was see if I can create just a
full face of like the beginning middle
to end with Azoff so yeah that's what
I'm gonna do I've got some goodies right
in here I haven't seen them before
I remember why I ordered I basically
tried to order everything that I could
create a full face with you know I
realize makeups kind of expensive you
know is that if you wanted to buy that
got a whole collection but if you learn
about the mascara the moisturizer primer
they're set in spring on a time you buy
all of that you can easy spread a cool a
hundred-pound
you know you can buy a pallet off the
pallet that's fine like 30 pounds it
Betty pounds there or you stop writing
the full collection it will actually
cost you money I actually forgot trying
to get our whole set is a lot but yeah
we're all good we're all good
full face and let us see what we can
find in here today my knees you're not
subscribe subscribe if you want to and
also follow me on my social as I'll be
doing some amazing giveaways this
Christmas season i DM y'all so just be
interactive leave comments leave likes
and I pick people at random okay let's
get into this video okay so here's my
box of goodies
Christmas it comes in little packages
like this I've never bought beauty or
makeup on a verse before never I look
everything's in like these little hazel
pouches I've bought a lot hello I've got
something face month these are the mini
ones from L'Oreal how cute are these I'm
going to do this so all the stuff that
is ageless own brand makeup has come out
in these little parcels and stuff like
that whereas you know they've been a bit
cheeky and then all the other branded
stuff just comes in its normal packaging
that's alright I can understand what
they might do it but so is this the
basic deposit packaging for a zorse
makeup so whit okay we're gonna sing
start from the base I wanted to give
myself a little bit other treatments on
camera so I bought these these are the
L'Oreal multi-masking clays and this is
really cute I saw it because I always
use this clay here this is the charcoal
clay but I saw this like multi-masking
play kit and I thought oh this is cute
I'm gonna go for the red one on my chin
areas red algae which is known for like
brightening and down here this is what I
call my little bigger like loads of
women of color habit it's so normal
this air is just a little bit dark color
this bits a bit brighter but if we can
even it out why not now I looked you
look like I've got the opposite of a
beard black centre with a red beard but
next is the charcoal one this is my
favorite one I love charcoal for my
large pores it draws out impurities the
packaging it says it's like a magnet so
let's just go right and then I'm gonna
go in with a green mask oh this is so
smooth it's creamier there are all
different consistencies okay so it's got
eucalyptus in it is known for its
purifying properties feels bluesy when I
wear a mask you know I feel like I'm
taking care of myself that I matter I'm
worth famously these are the lorry or
pure clay masks and I'm loyal ambassador
which absolutely not being so once this
dries I'm gonna just write quite a lot
I'll be honest I've never used this
product before but I do like Alfa hey I
don't want to look great I want to be
able to walk out with my sunscreen and
moisturizer and still look beautiful
that to me is a sign of a good sunscreen
shiny but I'm not blue oh that's not bad
at all
hello alpha hey and I feel like it's got
good coverage it's really moisturizing
but that's just mattified really nicely
you might be a new favorite so I like to
try new stuff you know thank you a sauce
okay what did I get next in my beauty
raegene still are I don't get much from
Stila and what I did notice some as us
was that they have lots of other brands
that I don't normally see here in the UK
liners Beauty bakery still are they had
Lime Crime they had a bunch of different
makeup brands I was like okay fine Fred
no okay this is the Stila one step
correct right in serum and it's a primer
as well I saw this on the side and I see
a lot of people raving about you know
what let me try it is like a rainbow so
it's your multicolored rainbow how many
parts do I need okay it's meant to color
correct and prime and moisturize all at
the same time but it's just making me
look great I'll be honest that it feels
a really nice oh this is what I was
avoiding so supposedly this is color
correcting and priming at the same time
we'll see when I put on my foundation
because I look like a like a statue like
statue grace oh they had a few different
beauty tools on like they didn't have
like the Beauty Blender but they have
brushes so I found these oval brushes
from Pro Tools and they're like marble
effect which i thought was quite cute
but I'm not gonna lie the box looks so
cheap but it's cruelty free synthetic
and our goodness I do love a brush and
then I also saw this sponge that looked
particularly phallic and I thought it
was kind of cute because they had
sparkles on it oh okay oh it's like a
little a little bit like a buck Kylie
that's a bit much for my younger viewers
but some people like sticking things
like this into their nether regions it's
kind of soft though you know oh this is
cute I just saw it on the website and I
was like okay let me try this out but
you know it looks a lot smaller than I
thought it would could it was going to
be let me just show you guys up close
check out their little booklet so it's
actually a little sponge applicator
there's not much surface area so I'm
gonna use this to do my concealer I use
the brushes to do my foundation very
very very soft very soft look guys check
it out very very soft and as you can see
it's got that like marble effect there
so when it came to foundation like OCA
Zoe's own brand they don't have their
own foundation yet I'm sure they're
coming with it because everyone is but
they have all of them because the
ordinary foundation they've got nas
they've got L'Oreal Paris
one thing I was annoyed at is that they
had the other Massacre Skin Foundation
which is a really really amazing
foundation but they only had one shade
like one shade of the foundation I'm
like how are you gonna just give us one
shade when that foundation is so good so
I ended up picking up the NARS all day
luminous weightless foundation and I'm
actually a combination of two shades
Macau and New Orleans
I'm so good what I look like this and
can put too much Macau my instant
thoughts on this brush is that it's very
flimsy this is just doing back and forth
rocking like a boat like which isn't
good when you need a firm hand to blend
I need to hold it here I'm not gonna lie
the head feels really really really nice
thing cause meant to get the shade
Banaras I just had to put this do-rag
wrong because you know my hair was
lifting we will release it at the very
end foundation on overall thoughts of
this brand like it's giving me a really
nice smooth base and finish and I look
good but I realize I don't have any
brows on so I'm just gonna put on brows
just make up they don't have their own
brows but they had all my favorite brow
product got the goof proof brow pencil
from Benefit Cosmetics which is my
favorite at the moment like it's so so
good it's so quick and easy so I'm just
gonna roll in and just get my brows look
in three key okay so my base and
everything is done now we are going to
get on to the good bit the Azoth actual
makeup as you can see we have some of
the past although we are getting into
the actual azoth only makeup not only do
they have other brand stuff on the
website they've got their own band stuff
they've got many like eyeshadow items
I've got a couple of pal a open the
lipsticks as everybody does some glitter
parts and yeah I'm just gonna go ahead
and create a look and see what we can do
this is the eye shadow
it cool partay no I do like the way it
looks like check this out it's kind of
like off pinky color with this very cute
design on it these are the shades in
this palette they're looking very
glittery and a little bit old-school and
if this was the best one I actually saw
on the website and I saw that gold and I
thought you know that gold I could wear
and that brown guy could wear I'm not
gonna lie everything I saw looked a
little bit shimmer and even this palette
like up close
it's very shimmery that isn't bad that
could be a nice little lid color I was
excited about this gold everything just
looks a little bit dull let's go in
let's see what we can do with it so
firstly I'm gonna go in with this
brownie shade to create a little
transition I'm gonna go in with this
first because this for me is like the
start of every I look alright and now
I'm gonna go in with that brown spot
like glittery it's just a shimmery shade
like it's nice for like a nice smoky but
can you see there's like flecks of like
glittering out bad though you know I
feel like this is great for someone who
just isn't like a blender or someone who
doesn't do like all that extra makeup
kind of a bit like me you can just be
like we're gonna put it all over your
eye and go you know what I don't hate
that you know it's quite a smooth creamy
chocolatey Brown just going with that
purple then yeah we're getting glitter
now she's not smart I think it looks
very a lots makeup it looks very much
like what an easel skull would do with
her eyes a bit more like gentle not too
pigment here not too extra it's quite
simple it is quite simple and they're
all the same texture which is kind of a
glittery not gluey like shimmery
shimmers shimmer shimmer who got the
keys to rushing us what I do need is
something a little bit more like matte
in there something a little bit stronger
there's this gold shade right here in
the middle which is one of the reasons
why I picked it out I'm gonna see if I
can dab this right here get something
good going on not bad you know not bad
at all
given the fact that they're all the kind
of same formula I think that looks
really nice it's a gold that has a
slight green
tinge to it though like I did say that
instantly I felt like the palette was a
little bit dull not done it's more muted
isn't bad it isn't bad at all it is a
bit darker than I normally go for but I
don't hate it I'm gonna go in with that
purple shape I'm gonna go under my eye I
think that is pretty not over I'm not
mad at what's in here okay I'm gonna go
in with a black eyeliner pencil it's
roll up it's roll up roll up okay that's
good it's a nice little shape I feel
like every iron needs to be roll up
because I don't know who has a sharpener
anymore okay it's it's black very creamy
eyeliner is eyeliner actually sometimes
you can have eyeliner that Nick she
feels that gravel in your eye so that
didn't feel like that it's creamy it's
got my color payoff question is is does
it last
or does it run you know it's coming
together nicely okay and here there's a
liquid line I kept an eye with that I
don't feel like this could be quite good
hey okay okay let's do this let's be
careful let's be smart I find it to be a
little bit dry it is a little dry I'm
not gonna lie but it has pale off if
you're someone who's like messy or
you're not good at this you can actually
take your time it reminds me of a pencil
because it's not like really liquidy
liquidy that gave me a really nice
snatched nice tidy line no cuz it was so
gravely and dry I was like is this gonna
do anything but hmm not bad at all and
it made a little mistake on that eye but
you know what or I like about it is that
I have a lot of control with it some
liners when you make a mistake or if
you're not careful or listen it's over
it's over and done with before you begin
it's up is the mascara and it's called
bossy the scar is one of the things that
I feel like you either get it really
right or you either get it really wrong
you guys know I've got eyelash
extensions in which are hanging on by a
thread I do like the way they look with
mascara I don't feel like this mascara
is doing any favors to my lashes that
are hanging on by a thread I definitely
have a love-hate relationship with these
lashes I love that I can look quite good
without wearing any mascara or false
eyelashes but honestly sometimes they
can
a little bit tore down when when the
game is over the jig is up and they just
start looking like spiders just fingers
hanging on by a thread and then you add
mascara to and you just go be that oh
just find this one to be too big I mean
it looks relatively nice it looks
relatively nice don't hate how those
eyes look the mascara was ok that one
was just too big but like I want to add
a little more of the purpley shade
though it says shimmer it's not glittery
so I like it next up I saw this jewel
glitter pop don't know what that means I
don't know if I can just put a touch of
glitter just on my lid oh there's like a
bomb in the top of it I think is what
you'd put on before you put the glitter
I'm not gonna glitter right now we're
not gonna glitter okay right face
finishing off there is a translucent
finishing powder
I love the design I think it looks
really nice you know I've noticed
there's no brushes in this there's not
there's nothing as much as I don't use
the things that usually come in compact
it's like they should at least be like a
piece of paper and it'll poof there's
nothing with it and I noticed something
the eyeshadow pallete there isn't even a
brush with it for me that's a little bit
I don't know I feel like it should have
something even if I'm gonna dash it away
I don't know is it just me it's a white
translucent finishing powder so my
instant reaction is am I going to look a
hot mess not bad but I'm always a very
very very skeptical and I mean I'm
scared so I'm a I'm a just stick okay
let's just do a little just gonna set
under my eyes just a little bit okay I
mean it's not bad I'm always a bit
skeptical about white translucent powder
but I don't look great.you or anything
so I'm going to say I think it's okay
but nothing to write home about next up
I'm going to go in with the blusher this
is this blusher
it's very rosy very very very rosy which
is one of those with one
I have to be really careful what I let
you don't look like a clown it does look
very pretty I would not think that color
would look that nice sunny but I think
it's cuz of my hair as well cute you're
actually cute I actually really like you
very much
I'm feeling very map now there is a
highlighter stick I noticed it yeah
shining like a bald man's head look at
that
you're gonna shine like this on me it's
creamy and then it goes dry very subtle
very very subtle and slightly blends
into nada this is not a highlighter
stick if you want to glow like if you
want to be a light beam in life this is
not gonna be the stick it gives you a
very subtle blue shades really nice
though the shades called flaws it's for
the working woman the working woman who
isn't trying to blind anyone you know
she wants to have a little bit of a glow
but she's gonna be too much like this is
what you'd wear to work if you were
highlighted to work not as much oh it's
not doing anything for me like nothing a
doll snice for work but it's nothing to
write home about like if I'm gonna wear
a highlight I need you to be seeing me
lick okay now the good part the lips let
us see what we can do in here got quite
a few lip products they've got liquid
lipsticks they've got stain settings and
they've even got a lip pencil slip
pencils gonna do nothing for me besides
make my lips look more jaundice I mean
it's a great way to neutralize my lip
before putting a put a liner on but
Geordie thing so firstly I'm gonna go in
with a satin lipstick this packaging
will get so annoying so quickly but I
can't like look at that it's so good mmm
she goes crazy I've been wearing a lot
of Reds recently I'm really really
liking them even without a liner but
there's something about this red which
has given me Grand Marais
African aunty red you know it so even
the shade it's the fini I've worn some
way more attractive Reds recently where
this one is just know the kylie red is
nicer stunner is a lot nicer this red
gives me african aunty like no oh this
is duh this Brown looks phenomenal is
in matte lipstick and the shade is cool
tuned oh my gosh that is gorgeous
this is what I like the most out of
everything
look at this lipstick don't ask me any
questions when I'm wearing this don't
ask me anything cuz it's so hard to find
a dark lipstick for my skin right that
doesn't make me look just dusty like
sometimes it's like a dark brown but
it's like the same tone as my skin and
it just looks like my lips went missing
on my face was this one is like oh I'm
really happy if out of this I found just
one amazing lipstick it's worth it
next up other liquid lipsticks so like I
know where these are made this shade is
called immersed I can tell this is one
of the brands where I need a line arm
it's mine it's a really nice consistency
and I think it almost almost looks
wearable without a line on again in wet
liner on Mac chestnut will forever save
the day well I have it look like lizard
lips it's really really dry flowing like
you have to wear a bomb underneath and
then you need to not stretch your lips I
just did this and I'm gonna do it like
an old English yeah these need a
Vaseline on underneath but this shade is
wrong not bad at all
I'm gonna put my Dior these are my
favorite the NIP glows I'm gonna put
that on before ya feel so good there's
ever a bomb you need in your life these
the deal lips blows really really nice
feel really nice and they've got a
little bit of a tin I'm sorry but that
had to go on before I put on the next
one my lips were gravel they were
literally gravel okay one more this is a
shade called observer oh okay the two
shades are very similar didn't realize I
picked up two shades at all almost look
exactly the same
no although they look really similar
they're very they're two very different
shades I feel like this is the white GaN
you this is the black gone you can
combine the two and make like the
perfect like shape for my mix chick you
have to wear a bomb and I even though
use the bomb underneath it hasn't
affected the way the lips it however
we're gonna need to line this
it's looking crazy even lined this shady
just doesn't look right on me that
doesn't look right on me at all thank
God for that
lip balm underneath because it was I was
out having an ash crumbling lip queen
right I think I'm gonna actually put
this shade back on because I actually
think it looks nice okay guys I am done
that is my full face of beauty and
makeup from Azar's
overall I like the product I think
they're okay they're not right for like
heavy dramatic makeup fans but I do for
like if you're someone who's like I just
like my makeup a little bit more simple
a little bit more affordable I actually
think it's a really really nice as much
as I thought that the eyeshadow palette
was a little bit shimmery it works if
you combine it with like some at some
like Mac or from wherever you like or
from where else you like to get max form
but overall I'm not mad at it and I love
the way my finished look glows lipstick
it's the satin matte lipstick I was like
breathtaking vine wouldn't be open to
trying more shades but that's the thing
when you buy makeup online that you
never know if it's gonna be like your
ultimate shade another shitty shape that
looks good on you and you know here we
can't return makeup so if you crack it
open and you don't like it
well you're left with it the highlighter
stick was nothing to write home about
and I even feel like my blush is kind of
you're not seeing much on but I do think
that the eyeshadow kit and the matte
lipstick is not too bad at all would a
loss be a destination would like where I
would get you know more makeup from yes
but there are other sites I prefer for
like makeup like you look fantastic or
called Beauty those are the sites that I
really really commit to for my beauty
for my makeup but I wouldn't be mad at
having to use a loss plus it's next day
delivery it's free I love it and I mean
I might look for their products to you
know try myself I'm not mad I like my
finish look okay guys I think that is it
from me if you're not subscribed to
subscribe and in the meantime you can
catch me over my Twitter almost snapped
out on my Instagram and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
