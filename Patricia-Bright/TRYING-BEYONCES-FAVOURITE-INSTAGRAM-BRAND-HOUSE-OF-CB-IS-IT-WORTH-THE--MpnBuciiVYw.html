with you I'm one of those guys I feel
like glitchy I omit the least sexiest
vibes you've ever seen unfortunately I
just don't feel like I have that
character I don't know why I feel like
sex and sexiness is about personality
and I get caught that I'm goofy a lot
and you know what I've always been goofy
but you know what I can look sexy
it's we about to do that because we're
gonna review how to see me today but
little eNOS with you I don't shop there
regularly personally I haven't actually
made my own purchase from there ever
before
but I think I've had some stuff in PR I
was like this time I want to spend my
own coin I want to see working
front-of-house 2cb because from the some
of the items that I've got what they
were banging I thought okay but I do
know is that they're huge and Instagram
I haven't been on that Instagram for a
good while and I haven't really used the
website before so I wanted us to do a
review see what it's like shopping on
houses CB get some items and then when
they're here I'm gonna try them on for
you are before we get into this video if
you're not already subscribed you can
subscribe to notifications on if you
want to see more of me I've also got my
Instagram my Twitter all that good stuff
people it's all down below but let's get
into this video okay so I'm going to go
on to the house of CB website and
actually going to go into their
Instagram page because I haven't seen it
to see if I can get some inspiration for
what I want to pick up but oh oh I'm
seeing Yasmin Chanel's boobies hey girl
I know Yasmin and her boobs are looking
good juice okay okay well this is
different this isn't what I would
normally expect for how sassy be I quite
like that
I'm gonna see if I can find that on the
website boss ooh I'm gonna put that in
to my closet what I will say is that the
prices on the house to see me these are
not cheap that shirt is 69 pounds while
that is a lot for a shirt I love this
this is beautiful
inspired can I find that this is pretty
I'm gonna put it in my basket for now
please note that this size would be
delivered within the next six to seven
working days UK Next Day Delivery is not
available

dress for for Nia I feel like a lot of
the online brides that came out
basically copied house of CB oh this

available at the moment you can
pre-order now and that item will be
despatched around 19th of June that is
over a month away from LA I love this
this dress it's going in my bag it's
quite surprising a lot of the stuff on
the website is not available for like
another five to seven days have we got
into a world where it's so impatient
like if it isn't Next Day Delivery I
don't want it is that crazy
but that dress is gorgeous look at this
beauty 129 pounds well it's a lot but
I'm doing your debts I can be sexy my
waist looks like it can be snatched in
this actually very different is it like
you know boohoo that's got loads and
loads of clothing their campaign imagery
is just very campaigning and nice I'm
feeling a bit like oh my god am I gonna
look like what these guys look like
because they are all really flawless
Oh his body is doing smash and snatch
out I better look like this when I
purchase a dress okay I need to go in
and out okay guys I think I am done
shopping on houses CB I found like
there's so many amazing items that I
really wanted but they will did she like
will be dispatched in like three weeks
or a month enough I was actually quite
surprised I didn't get as much items as
I would have wanted to but to be honest
for the items that I did get my basket
was expensive it was over a thousand
pounds so yes some items are definitely
going to be going back it is free next
day delivery but anyway we're gonna wait
we're gonna see when these goodies come
and we're gonna try them on so guys my
good news from house with CB have
arrived this is so heavy why is this so
heavy I don't understand it's ridiculous
it's this heavy but the color thing
itself is heavy I got this relatively
quickly I think I made an order on a
Wednesday and by Friday and I think I
made an order on a Tuesday and by Friday
it was here so I was really happy with
that because I only paid maybe 399 or
$5.99 for that service I'm not mad
I'll take it yeah I think we should just
open up and see what we have from the
outside look this is a big oh jeez I
feel sorry for the postman who had to
deliver this this is man birth I love
the fact that is in this box like this
I'm not gonna lie I spent a lot of money
and how so CB isn't cheap it isn't cheap
and I'm gonna pay for the returns so
this is probably gonna cost me like 50
pounds to return but yeah let's see what
goodies we like in here what I'm seeing
is something bright and right-moving
oh there's a lot of material I'm about
to be a goddess I'm a goddess wow this
is a lot calm it's a lot of material it
is heavy okay this is this little red
number on is it cute I don't know I
thought it doesn't
me as well it should it's an amazing
dress I feel like I need an extra small
to really snatch in everything to really
give me that snatch snatch look but it's
nice like it's giving me red carpet
special occasion hello hello I will tell
you that the material and here is
fantastic this is a hundred and fifty
nine pounds
I feel heads pensive darling where's my
champagne
I feel expensive I think this is really
nice but I don't like the style I don't
like the style on me it's actually
perfect for the warning please just get
that one leg out show that leg a muscle
and you know tonight is that it's got
this underlay here so it's not just you
know vanish to the wind some of these
dresses they have a split all the way up
to here and there's nothing to hide your
lady bits but this is covering on any
bits very nicely okay this number oh my
god man being me I hope this Brown is
not too close to my skin tone Brown I
hope I look good in this I hope I look
good bits
dearly beloved we are gathered here
today to watch Patricia Mary addressed
very beloved the waist is snatched a
little waist has come together thanks to
this dress are you gonna start returning
to my mom this dress is so nice this
dress is so nice
um I love the color this is a great
Brown on me I feel like this is a great
brown on all the girls what I've got to
say is that like dearly beloved listen
I've got this this is called an illusion
people my even have pasta before I film
this video I had passed up mistake
numero uno right and I feel like it's
given me a small small waist
it's get a small table I'm not a crazy
bum but a little booty-booty coming out
I love anything that comes in and makes
here look good and then look we've got a
low V right
you know the trend low thee but can you
see my milk dance no you can't we have V
but it's a nice breeze
this battle up that's all I'm asking for
we need some support for the girls we
need some coverage I don't mind a little
bit this we have it all in the dress I'm
rocking this to the summer solo and in
season I love everything about this
dress it fits really well
oh this is going in my closet and for
all of you guys who likes and like you
know where black the clothes and return
them and wear them you can't do that
with how to C be because you well you're
not gonna go out in public with this are
you so I think that's actually super
cool because actually if you love it
then you really love it this dress is a
hundred and twenty nine pounds I think
it's worth it I definitely think it's
worth it even though it's not my size I
still feel like it still looks good I
think like slightly small it might even
see me even more which would be quite
nice
okay okay this is the only black thing I
think I picked up and this is nice you
guys know I always have an obsession
with mesh this isn't the same like
bandage material as this but it's really
nice very turn of Venus see you guys
throwback 90s because this is what this
jumpsuit is giving me I'm feeling myself
feeling myself a jumpsuit it's even
giving the girls lift how you lifting in
the jumpsuit my gosh I lifted from the
shadows they are happy they have risen
from the deck of death
and they just sit in such a nice job - I
cannot lie this no tell you can't tell
me anything
I'm a fan this jumpsuit is a hundred and
twenty-nine but this is the thing right
if you're going to be paying prices the
quality has to be up to it and I
definitely feel like this jumpsuit I
said if I have the items that I tried
are bangin and they're up to it it's
just giving listen with the red lipstick
Catwoman here
Patricia Patricia the cameraman my
armors like it's breaking well it's cute
though I love the mesh here and I love
the fact that there's a double mesh to
give you a little bit more coverage
listen guys I say these women every time
I do not have the flat stomach in the
world I do not have a waist or hips okay
tooth shape straight up and down I'm
proud we can't all be coca-cola and this
I can't afford to buy coca-cola right
about now so Homer just be honest I'm
straight up and down right but can you
see how this is giving me just a little
bit of shape is I'm slightly suffering
but it's giving me a little bit of waist
and I just feel really confident in it
I'm not taking this off okay guys oh
this is a number that is doing the most
we have really got dramatic drama going
on here
in the white simple dress I think the
one thing I'll say is that a lot of the
clothing is very the same they're all
made out of this kind of material and
then yeah they're all kind of like turn
a sexy dress where I'm not manning it
let's get this on
oh oh oh this might be a demagnetizer
this dress might get you got to monetize
cuz the cleavage game if real strap the
babies away this is this dress it's cute
I mean it's a bodycon dress it's doing a
lot of sucking this material is really
really tight like it's like like really
sucking in I'm not right about now but I
like the like salt shoulder thing we
have going on like the pattern over here
I feel I feel a little bit square more
than normal I don't know if this dress
is accentuating that but it's nice it's
still a nice dress you know still a nice
dress but you know what white body con
real fitted put dinner oh I mean it
could be a struggle it could be a
struggle but it's cute it's a bit like
Spanx material so I'm just like move and
the dress had like fake hips on it how
you gonna put hips on a dress before
anyone was wearing it so I feel like
it's trying to give me a little
something
it's a pretty dress I'm loving this
shoulder region the girls are one fell
swoop from feeding YouTube and I will
say like as I'm wearing the clothing I
feel
therefore I kinda like the models
because they're they look amazing but I
still feel like I look good and that's
really important I don't feel I have
been deceived I was also looking for
items that weren't just like bodycon
dress it all jumped is the stuff like
that and I couldn't find that loads of
note they did have some lingerie stuff
but I'm not gonna wear that and then I
found this like two-piece suit for some
reason I thought it was nice and right
let me pick this up I feel like a
luxurious pimp I don't know what it is
that I like I wish for like a shit I
just need a cigars and sunglasses and a
fur coat I mean you know that time when
I was on the Riviera me and G no G
George George Clooney yeah we go way
back darling you know I used to date him
actually but his was a little bit small
I don't know I feel like this is just
such a nice little holiday jumpsuit I
feel when you were last in it do we like
this or is this giving you more like
pajama vibes pyjama Riviera or fashion
my mom would love this love this so I
feel like that's saying a lot
I think the top was like 49 pounds in
the bottom of 69 pounds so as a to
pieces as much as most of the other
items as well darling next up is this
dress now I feel like this is one of the
dresses that launched House of CB into
literally favorite fully this was the
dress that everybody had and so many
websites copied oh god I feel it is too
exposed in this what we have is a pre-k
in all the right areas but I feel like
it makes me look like I just got like a
really wild Bush of hair around here or
is that in my head I don't know
something about the way it's like it's
giving me that kind of like 70s
overgrown it's in my head it's in my
head bearing in mind because I know that
I just draw a little bit naked in it I
love the top part is my prom covered by
this it's my prom is just about covered
by this it fits really nicely it's
really flattering on I feel like if
you're someone who doesn't mind a little
bit of nudity it's not new
it's not new to all but it feels a bit
new like I will not be wearing this to
any weddings obviously this is almost an
its to the ring dress without having any
nips to the wind maybe we can say rips
to the wind
I don't really know we've got ribs and
upper thigh but and then under boobage
you know guys I don't like show you
under blue ridge well here we are today
but it's covered by elegant lace hmm is
it for me but it isn't a bad dress okay
guys I am done let's sit down I'll give
you my final thoughts okay guys that is
it that is my take on house of C be an
Instagram Brad but I feel like it's not
like your typical Instagram brand
because it's been around a while I like
the quality of the items I feel like you
get what you pay for I know what you're
getting if you see a dress that you
liked on there it's a hundred fifty
pounds you're bit like oh that's a
little bit pricey trust me it will come
and it'll be quite nice I'm not mad at
it I'm mad that returns though because
I'm not gonna keep every item listen I
can't afford to be spending 1,500 pounds
on clothing today about what I do return
it's probably gonna cost me an arm and a
leg as well so that is a little bit of
caution from you guys to exercise but
trust me I think there's some cute items
on there it's really feel like I need to
just and I feel like I need to like go
for dinner somewhere I feel like I need
to that call the guards of like should
we go out should get dressed up
that is what houses in be make see bill
might but yeah guys if there's anything
else you want to see for me let me know
but in the meantime I'll catch you
beautiful people later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
