any foul move and all my organs are out
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well today
I'm firstly gonna address the elephant
in the room and it happens to be this
little baby right here to be honest for
some reason I've got an under the eye
spot like is that a thing I never knew
it was a thing and it was just so
distracting that I decided to do what I
did with other team and put a beautiful
beauty mark right there
I don't wanna rub it off but it's gonna
look a hot mess so we're just gonna act
like it's like there and we're gonna
move on with this video okay but today
we are going to review another online
store a request from you guys again and
it's Oh Polly I really is a site that I
have been seeing everywhere especially
in my comments and I don't know much
about it I've never bought from a Polly
before I've never been on the website
before or anything like that and
basically I've seen a few girls wearing
dresses from Oh Polly and I was like
right let me go check out this website
and see what it is about like Kimberly
doing a little online shop line I've
never shopped them openly before and it
looks alright you know the the stuff
isn't cheap most of the stuff is
literally just vagina and breasts
everywhere I just there's just a lot of
rest
there's just a lot of black but you know
big at the gym so maybe I can show you
in a little bit of flesh but there are
some goo pieces the question is just
what wears you've got wearing this - I
don't mind you know sharing
but this you guys know this is my
nemesis nemesis in life I mean that's is
that kind of cute kind of cute say that
I should be on a party you know I don't
knock it if you thought the body and you
liked it it won't look amazing on you
but boy so I wonder if these as well
well then lovely lady you are you are
doing the most my dear I did I can
actually see your timelines insider part
I feel like I feel like I'm watching a
cell phone let's be real let's be real
imagine go to a family-friendly breach
with this is this being held on my own
face like come on
so my shopping experience on the website
I mean I felt like I was slightly
watching a little bit of soft porn I
don't know if it was me I might that
reserve we have you know nips to the
wind all the time however I just felt
like some of the code was actually
written laughable because it was not
much beyond like fishing net I was like
what is this but that's just me maybe
that's just to do with my own personal
taste however there were a fair few nice
really sexy dressy bits you know if you
were looking for something in a sexy and
for a night out or you need to bag a man
or you need to show your old man but and
you still got it there are a lot of
those kind of dresses as well and
outfits like that as well also I know
this isn't something really really bad
but it kind of reminded me like a little
bit of a like a house of C B but I
almost like a knockoff house too sleepy
and I hate to say that because it sounds
really judgmental but it just seemed
that it was trying to do what house to
CB was doing but in a way that wasn't as
refined yet that's me being sweet people
all in all I have
the most tightly packed dense bag I've
ever seen and it came next day look at
this what can I say I need a big package
hmm
I actually really like this this is
quite different to most of the other
bags so that is it this is the good old
bag let us get in this and see what
we've got and then try some of the
goodies on okay guys outfit number one
is this burgundy jumpsuit I've been
doing now that the clothing is not just
another one of those stores this is
double layered it's actually a really
nice material and we're not gonna have
Nick to the win because what they have
here is you know this um I don't know
they call this the kind of rubber stick
that keeps it in place so you don't need
any booby tape because it already comes
fitted in its doubled layer I've also
got a little bit of a waist trainer one
but you can't necessarily see it and
this is what you're really keeping mean
it's kind of sexy but it isn't actually
a really cute jumpsuit this chopped suit
was thirty-five pounds this is going
straight into my will be wearing
regularly wardrobe 30 listen I thought
this was 17 pounds I just checked and it
was 35 pounds this isn't a bad jumpsuit
it's really nice material it's double
layered my body looks good I feel very
comfortable in there I mean obviously
you've got something you know but I feel
very comfortable I feel like it's a
really nice piece of material I'm down
okay another jumpsuit here it's a lip
it's a little bit open right about now
yes we have a lot of feeding the world
going on right about now it's a nice
jumpsuit it isn't great for my body
shape because it's just it's just doing
a lot for me here but if you're someone
with smaller boobies then I think this
could be really nice for you you can see
like my underwear and what my shorts and
stuff that wearing underneath is a
little bit thinner than the other
material and if either pair of knickers
on you definitely be able to see but
I've got shorts or what you can do is
see my shorts underneath here so yeah
it's definite
thinner material but it isn't bad I
really like the cultural region because
the crotchal region is not come off its
like lychee the Atwell is the leather
close it slightly come on but I feel
like it's the opposite of that so this
jumpsuit is say five pounds I do think
it's worth it I just don't think for me
or girls with big boobies you're not
gonna have any support in this
yeah it's there's not giving you much
hold surprisingly as you can see I seem
really to be uncomfortable and I'm just
like trying to cover it all right about
now so yeah hmm you know lucky for me I
have my little shorts on because this
number here is a bit of a you know leave
your hopes and dreams at the door and
just bring your nudity in because it's
so weird this split I mean maybe it's
also meant to be that high any foul move
and all my organs are out is this it's a
rap it's really a rap oh by the way I
picked up the call conservative items on
the website but this basically not own
we're nips
we're fanny wear everything well
everything is to the wind life is to the
wind it's honestly so significant I mean
I get the idea
I get the visuals of the dress it's kind
of this kind of grecian grecian
something or the other but maybe you
maybe if I could do it like that but I
don't feel very comfortable that it's
gonna stay put like that I mean like
this I can get it I can see it Oh
Grecian goddess and everything in her
pink but realistically it's all very
opened imagine to these run here no do
not don't imagine let's be holy
Christian Jenna I would need to have a
sewing degree to be able to actually
wear this because yeah this is actually
all the way it almost up to my
bellybutton
okay I can literally see the flares in
the reflection in the mirror and giving
myself John Travolta
these flags are real do you know what
I'm gonna review that the exact same
material of the house of CB once almost
almost they have a jumpsuit from the
house to CB which is really nice and
it's this exact material I don't like
the two items together they're not bad
though they're they're nice I feel like
my bum looks nice in it it's quite thick
material although we do have a slight
like you can tell there's a slight break
in the threading so it kind of looks
like there's a hole there
but no one would notice that and then
this chocolate brown top is really nice
it's really tight it's double layered
again double layered cotton and really
really stretchy and I love this square
net and it's like really like it's
really gathering me in and this will
look so nice with a pair of black
trousers this is a keeper this will be
in my wardrobe it's square it's in
chocolate jacket on chocolate you know
double double the chuckles Ness which I
really quite like but trousers I have a
jumpsuit that does the same thing so I'm
unhappy to say these are no but they are
not bad quality if you're not moving
little crop then look nice actually
they look nice just firstly I'm a cat
woman in this stage cat living with
breasts if you don't have breasts this
is gonna give you breast because it is
squish up squish up and it is heaving my
memory Gran's for the whole world to see
I feel sexy in it I'm not gonna lie I
feel sexy if I walked up here like in my
jumpsuit my catsuit breasts out and just
like you know just getting ready yeah
yeah of course I'm feel sexy but I feel
particularly uncomfortable to be honest
I think this isn't the kind of thing
that I personally would wear out but
there definitely goes who I know would
wear it and look good listen this is
going to give you sex appeal this is
such a 100 percent men listen oh I'm
being far too long I'm gonna wake the
baby and I waited
this bright little number isn't it this
is literally do you know what is nice
right it's nice it's not me but it's
nice
that's what I feel like openly it's not
necessarily me but there's some cute
items this is that breast is that more
breast that more breast you can see if
you're hungry I can feed the world with
the village leaders right right now
honestly but this would be a look if
this was my style that makes any sense
what do you think of my outfit I think
it would you let me go out wearing this
if you went out of my house I'd yeah
it's a fuzzy suede material so I don't
know how well this is gonna wash
I don't know how regularly you're gonna
wear it but you know if you were just
like you know what I just wanna be extra
you could do it in this you get what it
says on the tin what the dress looks
like on the website is what it looks
like on and I actually think I look
better than I thought I would look in it
I feel like I look almost a luminous
like like a halo glow should be coming
off of me yes there's a there's a lot of
breasticles there's a lot of boobage I
mean there seems to be a trend or no
poly a lot of boob Phyllis I need to
call my girlfriend but let's go to Miami
one night in Vegas I might just wear my
lemon dress you know I didn't hate okay
so this is this look here little crop
top again it's got the double layered
like a double layered cotton oh no this
isn't double layered this isn't double
layer but the material is actually
really really really really nice I'd
really like it okay so this is this
two-piece set I don't know what kind of
it is it's kind of coffee it's kind of
time it's weird and the package says
otter but it's a nice little set here
it's in that kind of slinky material
it's got this extra piece of fabric for
the top which I accidentally put around
my neck and I was so confused it looks
nice but two bins it was rolling back up
into the top so you can't really see
that separate look but overall it's nice
this is 40 pounds which i think is very
affordable for a two-piece set again it
is
it isn't the thick thick material like
the first jumpsuit it's nice though it's
nice material if you've got a look or
you saw this and the website you got all
does this look cute yeah this is what it
looks like on me as well I'm sucking in
for dear life I love the little ruching
detail here but like it's quite VPLS so
you need to be careful what you're
wearing underneath oh we've got we've
got look it's giving me slight contours
here isn't it look at that car door that
is on booty contour that isn't actually
they're not unique so I come in like
that but this again isn't my soul feel
like my Fanny's come out to greet you
it's not a bad outfit if this is what
you like you could I just saw like crap
in the reflection and it was really
internalized my crack is eating the
jumpsuit it's swallowing it swallowing
it Oh in public I would not dare oh yeah
and I feel like it's vodka the color is
so like nude I just saw Barry eat just
expose and again I feel like I picked up
the most conservative items I could find
I feel so weak spell I can imagine that
there's gonna be one goal he's gonna
kill this and look amazing this is it
for me I didn't even know this shoulders
going like this or if it goes like this
so that you could wear this lots of
different ways I like the fact that you
know you're not seeing as much boobage
as you've seen this um the other outfit
the color is this color is nude and just
just just have a look just just take a
knife all of that right now my crack is
eating the jumpsuit okay so I kind of
like this again I'm warming up to the
look the old Pony look which is a little
bit more you know out there but this is
really nice I could wear this this
square neck top is really nice I like
the burgundy color it is really thick I
love the cotton this bit is also double
layer but this
isn't double-layered but I'm not
bothered it is cropped but it's well
fitting and then there's this little
pencil skirt which is again is that kind
of really nice cotton and it's doubling
it as well and high-waisted and you know
would it be opening without giving us
some spleen almost having some spleen
we've got a very high thigh going on
right about now I could rock this look
if this was my style I could totally see
what someone would Rock this and feel
really cute in it it's kind of
instagramming it's kind of sexy
the top is a keeper I'm keeping the top
I love the top overall I think it's nice
that is my leg looks like a chicken
thigh it looks like a chicken thigh what
and what is this the lot of leg on show
from when the gap is basically almost
showing that other leg we might as well
just have the skirt like this the skirt
is nice quality double layered really
thick of you are on in the market for a
skirt that is pure like this then you
know this is okay we've got another
really nice top which obviously we can't
show in YouTube again because yeah it's
just ah cuz the lace on this is actually
really beautiful it's really really nice
and it's really well made it's also got
the rubber reverse on it as well but
it's just it's just so why cause it's
just so white I just feel very exposed
but this is obviously my own personal
preference you know I know there's some
girls who'd like to have it have their
boobs you know they look cute and nice
but for me my goal is just don't I don't
know they just they're just not ready
for this
you know they don't want the whole world
to see them just yet you know not not in
this way they need to be ready the
tables really really nice color is so
nice but guys this is fully and Ifill
and also it's strong and I hate when
tops are a thong I just think about no I
just think about yeast infections and
just you know stuff getting stuck in
there that really shouldn't be in there
only underwear and you know be commando
I'm not ready for all this additional
thick material to be just in there
gather
here's this dress which you know again
was an attempt at calm it was an attempt
at being conservative it's almost like
they give with one hand we have our
boobs covered up and take with the other
the bottom is particularly short and the
back is particularly particularly newt
as well I mean they tried there's a lot
of side boobage Michie coming up right
now and a lot of leg but this isn't bad
maybe if I got a bigger size I think get
more coverage on this as well get you
know the nipple that's about to fly out
you know get that situated effectively
and maybe get a little bit more length
in the body of the dress but I love the
color and I think that this style is
actually really really nice on this so
yeah this isn't too bad
or this is that when I favorite pieces
again though it is a bit short we do
have a bit of side boob but the material
is nice the quality is nice and if it is
okay okay guys said that is it from me
that was my review on some items from Oh
Polly as a website I think that if you
wouldn't looking for that kind of outfit
a hundred percent I'll be confident for
you to go there check it out and pick up
some goodies personally it's not my
personal style it's a little bit and a
bit watching for me you know but maybe
that yellow dress might get a little
wear one day when I'm trying to be you
know on my a-game or whatever but I love
the fact that some of the items have
this like double layers like it wasn't
really really thin material and it fit
really really well again it's not my
personal style some of the items on the
website were just a little bit you know
- gaping - holy too much brass too much
- just too many organs available for
everyone to have a piece off with dinner
for good donations in an outfit it was
doing a lot but for those of you guys
who do like Oh Polly and I've wanted to
try out some goodies from there why not
go on you know bring your sexy back one
or two days a year if you want to and
check out some pieces on there so guys I
think that's it
me of course I have my mud if you
haven't seen it either in the
description bar below where you can
check it out but in the meantime I will
catch you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
