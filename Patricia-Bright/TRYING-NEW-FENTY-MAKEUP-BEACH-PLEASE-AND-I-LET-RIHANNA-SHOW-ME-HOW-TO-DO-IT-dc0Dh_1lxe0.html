say he's hello there beautiful
people welcome back to my channel I hope
you are doing well I've missed you guys
I've taken like just a for a week
oh and I've been in China and I don't
like feels like I haven't been here but
it's nice to be back and be like hey
girls sorry I am slightly excited it so
it feels good to be here I have put on
weight so before anyone comes instead
you know poor judge are you pregnant now
okay let's not do it today the power of
contour is about to save these jowls
okay and the power of Rihanna is gonna
make me look extra cute today I'm gonna
follow her tutorial using her new
product as well and I saw this video and
Vogue and it was just so effortless you
know how people are just like I just see
this this is this a brand
they're like flawless like that was a
literally Rihanna I'm gonna pitch in
follow her then let's see if that is how
I'm gonna come out looking you know and
I feel like with similar in the fact
that like our application doesn't look
like perfect but when it's done at the
end it's like floor loose like actually
flawless but you know she's got a great
base to start off with oh and I'm gonna
go in with with the new girlies from
fancy beauty and I just got these in PR
and I'm like yes come on
I'm really excited like they're trying
out this color and this glamour darling
so yeah let's get into this video
Rihanna didn't start off with a base but
currently my skin is ashy so I'm going
to be going in with a base I feel like I
need it at the moment so I'm gonna go in
with my vitamin-enriched face base from
Bobbi Brown I love this it's more like a
cream and my face needs this okay next
she's going in with the foundation I'm
gonna go with my Fenty Pro filter
Foundation and sponge that on I sweat
for me I find it really strange to like
sponge on my foundation without doing my
brows I feel like I need brows before I
do foundation but you know Rihanna does
it this way I'm gonna do it this
way I can do my makeup in ten minutes we
was talking about doing my makeup in ten
minutes because I feel like it takes me
ten years to do my makeup guys I do feel
like doing like a little makeup
tutorials like a good way to like ease
myself back into doing YouTube videos
it's so crazy like if I haven't done a
video in like a week it just feels like
I don't even know what the hell I'm
doing I feel like that in life does
anyone else feel like that I'm like
whatever I what is going on what's
matter is I don't actually use this
foundation like regularly regularly I
think it's not my go-to foundation in
all honesty but when it's owned it is
kind of flawless it really does give you
that flawless finish very important to
contour your face for your face not the
way you see ah yes girl tutorial
contouring with the match sticks I'm
gonna go in with espresso which is
actually quite dark but really really
good and you know what I've been saying
recently I wish I had more forehead I've
got lit just a very small forehead and I
was like you know what big foreheads are
kind of cute and I just wish I had one
mine is like this big like relatively
I've just got a pea head if we just
gonna pretend we can contour our
forehead like we did crazy double chin I
felt that in my spirit girl we need to
hide that double chin it's not that bad
it's not that bad but you know what you
feel it you know you feel it in yourself
like you're like I've just you know I've
been indulging a little bit more and
there's nothing wrong with it there's
nothing I've decided I embrace my summer
weight gain I swear I put myself under
pressure I like to like look extra
snatch and then that stress makes me eat
more chocolate and then you know it's a
cycle I've accepted it I have accepted
it people I learned how to contour when
I gained weight believe it or not
that's when it comes in I'll come back
that weekend guards are okay we're just
gonna use this brush which is similar to
her foundation brush I do have mine but
it's kind of a bit crusty right now and
I'll be honest sometimes I definitely
have that kind of application I can look
a bit rough but I feel like when it
comes together it comes together well
oh and I feel like you know from talking
the whole thing you know she's puppet
triangle when you're doing a contour
under they give you that whole long now
he's giving us a license right over I
have no Lord oh I think I might need to
leave that alone I feel like the order
which we enough what some how many cup
is completely different to the order I
put wine on like there's no brows
I've got no under-eye highlight and I've
already got contour it just it just
seems you know this seems a bit who
could be piggledy but that's a powerful
thing right people do that makeup
differently like you don't have to do
make up the way everyone does it you can
do it the way that what here you
concealer this okay next so she's going
in with the max I'm gonna use the shade
latte she's warming it on our hands
first and maybe this is what I haven't
done before because I do find this to be
quite drying but you know what
strategy you know oh I just went ahead
and did one little swipe I'm just gonna
do two
oh we're getting a globe we're getting a
globe I always forget how these like are
magnetic I love that I love that every
time I see them like connecting right
lovers meeting it in the night it just
gives me life and we're gonna get it
right on the nose bridge just like I did
so reason next step was to mattify but
I've got quite dry skin and I feel I
feel hello.mat right now but I do not
feel like I need powder right now okay
these brows magically appeared I'm gonna
go ahead and do my brows as well look
really like fine and like like
individually done I feel like we
probably got micro braiding
I'm gonna use my benefit like my
ultimate brow combo I'm gonna use my
purse Eisley my brow and my gimme brow
at the same time I'm going to do one
line on the bottom just like that one
line on the top that just gives me like
fullness at the ends and I'm gonna throw
that in there
right that's what I do on the end and
then I'm gonna use precisely my brow to
basically almost draw the lines to give
me a much more gentle look I feel like
the best browser when you can get like
individual strokes I'm gonna tidy that
up with a little bit of NARS soft matte
complete concealer and then I could be
Rihanna's understudy bra darling I am
having fun I swear like dude this is
reminding me of the old school days like
when you used to just watch some random
girl do their makeup in the bathroom or
in their bedroom days it's changed so
much okay she wound up her eyes with a
bronzer I'm gonna go in with my
Anastasia
Maria palette there's a che called by a
letter which I think is gonna do just
that okay now I think it's time to get
into the good stuff here is the new
collection from fenty beauty huh what we
got here oh okay so these are the
kilowatt foils oh this is what Rihanna
just gave us a glimpse off in the vogue
video and I love the fact that even the
inside of the kilowatts are like a
different kind of effect that they're
kind of mirrored and they're just really
banging feel like I've got to swatch
them all for you so you can just see how
gorgeous they are is seven-day weekend
and poolside the shades are just fan o
do you know what they're not as crazy as
I thought they were gonna look this poor
side is such a gorgeous shade I just
wanna put it all over this one here is
sand castle and mint mojito Gorge
mm-hmm I wonder if that would look good
on me I don't know about that and this
bad boy here this is the one that we was
using in the vogue video it's dramatic
AF and looks gorgeous
this is sangria sunset and mimosa
sunrise
love drama okay bitches yes girl I see
the drama in this okay okay so I love
the way readers eye makeup she just goes
in like if she can do it like this I'm
doing it like this she just put on her
brush and just oh oh that is instant
that is instant fabulous payoff that was
easy that was easy
that was so easy as in that just goes
shoosh it's on your eyes there you go
this is what's important you know but
not out here trying to judge how you do
your makeup and your blending you just
want to you know look nice I love this
this is my kind of makeup okay so I'm
just gonna go in with a little bit more
from the Anastasia palette just to like
blend out my edges and transitions a
little bit more and also warm up under
my eyes okay right I'm use the same
palette okay right three is going in
with the same palette and is using this
shade as a blush but I think it's more
like a highlight are let's see a well
she is giving me a vibe with all of that
in all honesty if you guys haven't
picked up this brush all the foundation
brush genuinely hands up you do need it
it does work so well is the perfect
shape and it's so good this is I feel
like this is even too strong on me okay
now okay I'm telling you look at this I
feel like on my skin they just really
really show art do you guys remember
that first video I did that Fenty one
and it was like whoa it was a lot it was
really a lot
oh but auntie that just blend in so
nicely okay John I thought it would look
more like orangey but it doesn't it
looks really really nice just like this
my vibe for summer is
okay and then coming back in with is
more yes sunset and I think that as a
blush cuz the vibe is more is more okay
why there's more is more oh wow
sometimes I do prefer like really warm
brushes and that is quite a cool brush
on me but we can make this work try some
oh yes i layer highlighters all the time
well we are layering more highlighter
here darling he is not playing any games
the highlighter game is on level three
thousand right now she was talking about
layering highlighters so you know we're
just going to read us maybe that is
where is a completely different
consistency to the other ones this is a
lot more reflective like as you can see
it's a lot more reflective I feel a
little bit 80's disco like a little bit
80s disco right now okay we is using
this actually everywhere nose bridge the
same brush
maybe there's a trick to it because I
feel like my looks off-center now I'm
gonna use sandcastle to do the inner
corner of my eyes in the corner of my
eyes and she's right it makes such a
huge difference
oh he said he's popping you see popping
it's popping Oh lashes
once we put some lashes it's the game is
over
it's a transformation I'm gonna go in
with my bad girl bang mascara and then
find some like really like floaty like
natural blushes that's crazy
I feel cute even without my false lashes
on so then I feel cute without false
lashes on that is a testament to feeling
good like goes on they say usually feel
like I come together and I don't look
like a thumb when I've got lashes on but
you know I had them on and I feel like I
look all right
it's a feeling when you don't feel like
a thumb hashtag okay so Ruiz next step
was the lips and these are iridescent
lip Luminizer trio I don't know if it
comes in a box set like this where you
can buy the individuals what shade is
she use I don't feel like my shade looks
like hers but I do feel like this shade
looks exactly like their eyes so we're
gonna roll with this and make it work I
feel like I need to swatch these for you
oh that shade is called ready to mingle
and there's this Goldy shade which is
called bilingual Auvergne this like blue
shade which is strange but it isn't
actually blue it is called single her
look looks really gold so I'm gonna put
that on my lips
okay so I just watched the gaudy one I
looked on TS in all honesty I don't know
why so I'm gonna add a little bit of
this Bobby Brown it's when I can nude a
base just to give me cuz I've got quite
dark lips so it's nice having like a
nude base and then put those colors on
top once I've got a lip liner on I feel
like I can do any shade but without lip
liner no okay and they're gonna go in
with this a lip gasps okay oh I
definitely feel like I've just got a 95
but I'm shining I look healthy I look
natural darling
this is cute okay Brianna's last step
her last it of course a little body
lover and I actually do use the shade
who needs clothes which is the lightest
shade and I'm fine with it I love it on
me it just brings everything together
I'm smiling I'm smiling to myself
because I feel beautiful you're nice
you're like yeah it's a nice feeling
when you feel good about yourself you
know what you could enjoy it it's um I
like yourself cause you're cute that's
okay
it's okay and I feel cute I'm definitely
bloody loved' up if you can't tell okay
that is me done trying out the new
goodies from fancy Beauty and following
Rihanna herself showing me how to lay my
makeup it's different to how I did it
but I still feel like the finish results
are really really good I love it
I'm very shining though I am shining
there's a lot of reflection refraction
okay guys I am Janna what do you guys
think do you think that you know I've
got that Rihanna look going on it's nice
to try out the new collection it's quite
like shiny and glittery and like quite
feminine and girly and fun but I feel
like that is the vibe for summer and I'm

like it's really different it feels
