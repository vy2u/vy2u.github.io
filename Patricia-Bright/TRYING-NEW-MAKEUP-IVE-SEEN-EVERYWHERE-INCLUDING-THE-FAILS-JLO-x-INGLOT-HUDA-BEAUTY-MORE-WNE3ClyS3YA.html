coverage no no no no it's so beautiful
hello there beautiful people welcome
back to my channel I hope you are doing
away though alright I'm about to do a
full face of new makeup I wanted to do
products I've been seeing advertised
everywhere products that I've been
hearing about just all new makeup
because we might as well try out stuff
I've got the JLo collection with Engler
I've got some of the huda beauty so
we're just gonna get in there and like
put it all on our face and see what we
look like cuz I know it can sometimes be
a little bit overwhelming there's a lot
of makeup up there regularly so my face
is yours you can use mine to see whether
or not you want to try some of the
goodies that are out and about so if you
guys are not already subscribed to my
channel go ahead and subscribe you can
put your notifications on follow me on
my Instagram and my Twitter those are
the two that I'm using the most I feel
like I've given up on snapchat I'm not
gonna lie but you can't follow me on
snapchat for the moments where I do feel
like I might have a rant I might be on
there but yeah definitely my Instagram
and my Twitter and yeah let's get into
this video so I'm gonna go ahead and use
the Clooney beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer it's a two in one this
isn't new but there wasn't any new
foundations I wanted to try out I wanted
to put this on and it's gonna be
complementary to something else that is
new in this is one of the foundations
that gives you major coverage is very
very pigmented foundations can they be
pigmented I feel like this foundation is
pigmented it's very rich in color and
it's a little bit more on the red side
so if you're more red undertones this is
definitely gonna be a foundation for you
and you know I've realized I feel like
people don't want their exact color
foundation you want a foundation that
kind of makes you look like you but a
little bit better
and I feel like this foundation makes me
look like I've got a little bit more
color a little bit more richer and know
it might look a touch red on camera
right now but trust me
trust me it's a good one
blends in like a dream I've got full
coverage now we've got the base we're
ready to try it in some new goody ok so
next I'm gonna go in with the new new
from Clinique and these are the new
beyond perfecting super concealer these
are camouflage 24-hour concealer I love
it when you guys are out here making big
ol Claim and I've seen the ads
everywhere I feel like it plays it for
my videos as well as your like their
full coverage and they're gonna give a
lot of bang but I'm gonna put it on and
we're gonna see how good your go looks
so I'm gonna go ahead and use the shade
deep 24 under my eyes to give them that
highlight and that glow this is really
yellow which I love I love a yellow
under eye and it's extremely
moisturizing it's not a dry formula at
all which is great for our school to
perform wrinkles under our eyes you know
for me the concealer that I wear under
my eyes has become so so so important I
can't mess about if not it looks like
I've got a desert under my eyes because
I have quite bad wrinkling I don't know
why also cuz I have eczema as well
especially in the winter I find that if
I don't use the right concealer I look
like a hot dry sandy mess and it's not a
good look these are super moisturizing
these are really creamy so that is
giving me coverage but I could build
that up I actually end up putting it a
little bit more on and then it was quite
wet at first but then it dried down
really nicely like it I like it put a
little bit down my nose I feel like I
need a bit more on my forehead actually
we need a little clothes over here let's
just go all the way in laughing that
base is done I'm feeling cute I'm
feeling like it's now time to go in and
put some fun stuff on top okay so I got
this this is the Jennifer Lopez Inglot
collection I haven't seen very much
about this one you choose white being by
us right now I haven't seen a lot of
people talking about this collection I
don't if you saw the height everyone's
obviously coming up with new makeup
collections and Jennifer Lopez and
Inglot have come up with this package
here I'm having a feeling that some of
the items are gonna be a little bit
ghostly on me so I'm also gonna mix that
with probably some huda beauty which is
new as well this is the Kohl of
fashion palate let's see what we've got
in here Oh what is this I don't I don't
know what that means to be but great
okay oh okay
living the highlights are that looks
good living la vida hey later she makes
her think I'm close vengo dancing in the
Rick why am i singing Ricky Martin
I love Ricky Marty Raney oh that's a
nice little that's a nice little
highlighter right there go on a little
bit of an English
that's the mascara mascara that's kind
of banging now this to me this was
fantastic have a look at that and it's
magnetic I've been that super cool you
go like this let me go in with this
transition shade right here and see what
it looks like on me well getting much
kind of payoff
let me try putting in a little bit of
that concealer as a base to see if I can
get a little bit more of a pop coming
let's try again to be honest it's kind
of invisible I'm gonna go in with
something similar this is from this is
nice core obsession huda beauty I'm
gonna try it an alternative which is a
very similar shade but as you can see is
giving me more payoff there we go
this unfortunately just wasn't it just
wasn't showing up hmm no we're just
gonna go to the food obsession palette
I'm gonna go with this kind of orangey
shade here orange ecole pick up we're
just gonna dab that right on the outside
that's so pretty and I'm gonna go this
shade a little bit on there in a corner
and I always tell people like the
beginning of my makeup always looks a
little bit like what is going on it
looks like a nun blended mess what trust
me like we get there we get there okay
so I added just a hint of brown just to
like you know
look a little bit better I'm gonna go
ahead with this shade right here to
create a bit of a spotlight oh oh okay
well this wasn't giving me much but this
is giving me a ton oh I think I actually
put too much on it's actually quite a
cool tone champagne actually overwhelmed
the rest of the eye because it's
actually so bright I didn't expect that
to be whoa as pigmented as it is and
little really goes a long way with that
hmm interesting in to resting now I feel
like my eye is just it's not it's not
working because I never expected that to
look as cool tone gold as it does look
and I didn't expect it to be as strong
as it looks I feel like I got this wrong
I feel like I need to start again does
that ever happen is that ever just me
but I'm just like maybe we need to just
keep going let's put some mascara and
eyeliner one and see what we have no no
no no so guys that was a moment of
honesty and what sometimes happens when
I put on my makeup when I'm like no I
look like a hot mess
and I baby work that off and start again
sometimes you just got to keep it real I
was not I don't know I just the the
combo just wasn't quite working for me
we're gonna try and start again okay
okay right I'm gonna go back in with
this transition shade and I'm really
hoping and praying that we're just gonna
get some more from it and we're really
not so I'm gonna go in with spice which
is from my it's my rake palette which
unfortunately I dropped and a few pieces
have dropped out I'm gonna use this
shade here as a nice transition color
just so you can see what a transition
color should look like so I'm gonna try
the other one this is new this is the
gemstone of session palette and I feel
like I want to shape use this shade
right here in the outer area that's
actually beautiful oh you are beautiful
this is beautiful you see it's so
beautiful beautiful gorgeous
I don't know how soaked creamy and
pigmented I thought it would be really
chunky but it isn't this yeah I'm gonna
go back and use control freak in the Ray
palette just to add a little bit more of
a brown to give me a little bit more of
depth to my eye you know okay I'm gonna
go back in with this shade here
remembering how strong a shade it is use
that in my inner tear duct and just up
my eye a bit like that is really like
champagne E bright and really pigmented
okay I feel like we've got something I
feel like we've got something I'm gonna
try the mascara the Jennifer Lopez
mascara hmm not bad I love how tiny the
wand is the palette there wasn't giving
me much life in all honesty the mascara
is actually really nice I feel like it's
really picked up my lashes they're
looking bountiful and lovely and full
and I really like them gotta go some
whoo delicious actually Giselle I've not
been wearing these for a good while well
you know why not go back to an old favor
I'm gonna go in with this powder setting
powder from nip and fab I store this and
as I always yellow and it is drugstore
this is all just ticked it it's new
bearing in mind that I basically use the
same setting powder for the last like 45
years like it's doing the most because
some of them can kind of have been me
like a Ghostface Killah but as for this
one and was like oh this that's kind of
yellow okay it's gets give me yellow
coverage Oh Lord we're just getting it
everywhere now I have been looking for
the ultimate like drugstore powder I
think I just need to wipe that all off
though and see what I look like
oh it's really it really got in there
didn't it I feel like it's doing a great
job of setting I I look set I will
definitely be bringing this back I think
I'd look a little bit colder than normal
but when I spray this I think we're
gonna be good
okay okay okay we've got a new
highlighter in from Anastasia's Beverly
Hills this is a dream glow kit colors
are looking all kinds of Oh iridescent
and sparkly a little bit of glitter a
little bit too much glitter but sunshine
and regal are looking fantastic
I feel like regal is gonna back let's
try a little regal it's a little bit
chunky obviously you can tell you from
looking at them that they look a bit
chunky but not in a way that I hate I
love the color of this oh this is good
I'm gonna go back in that JLo palette
and I'm gonna probably try and use that
just to touch of it to highlight down my
nose these are really pigmented these
are really pigmented this ash dennah was
going on there but these ones is it just
me who has really stopped wearing blush
I don't wear blush as like a priority
anymore it's weird but I do have a new
brush whoa Tom far darker hey this is
new this is new from Tom Ford the so I
was doing a little dance I'm so sorry I
need to tone it down
I forget forget I'm being professional
dude dump this tell me how gorgeous that
looks
I'm so excited look at that I've used
this once a forum not gonna lie and it's
new and it just gives you a wash
I think people fail to see how good temp
tomforde makeup is it's ridiculously
amazing you see that it's just the wash
it's just the touch it's complementing
my highlighter and you know you might
look at this and think you know
especially for a chocolate guy like me
like what in the ashy hair but actually
it's really nice I could build it up if
I wanted to but I don't want to we don't
want to do that you girl doesn't want to
do that
okay I'm gonna 9 my lips with some Bobbi
Brown lip pencil in chocolate this is
such a buff color I'm gonna try the new
goodies from makeup Shayla it's color
pop I paid for like the whole collection
myself and I am obviously in the UK
color pop is in the u.s. it was doing
one kind of delay like it literally took
an additional month to come and then on
top of that I had a custom visa like 25
pounds it hurts
it's like customs pay I'm like leave me
alone I don't want to pay customs paid
the customs I'm really excited I think I
want to do a video on like youtuber
collaborations so I'm gonna try the
other stuff but we're gonna go in with
the nippy's I want to do a nude lip so
yeah
this new is looking this is called
quickie it's looking a little light but
I think with my liner mmm smells really
good
oh it's a pretty
it feels really nice on I'm gonna line a
little bit more with me and the shape of
my lips I always have to have a line I
look in if I don't have a line so now I
can't wear it like how everyone else
will is it well you know I tried mmm
that's a really that's a really nice
formula actually like the color I think
it might be a touch light for me only a
smidge and with my line art I think it
looks great okay and I'm gonna top that
up with the ultra grassy Nick this is
also a little bit glittery I think you
can wear this on its own but that has
taken it to another I'm feeling that
would you guys think of the lip this is
a beautiful new that gloss connection
this is really nice
that my base looks phenomenal if I do
say so myself

fresh really like really vibrant but

look let me know what you guys think I'm
feeling it you know me I am a makeup fan
I just want to look cute at the end of
the day and I feel like I have achieved
