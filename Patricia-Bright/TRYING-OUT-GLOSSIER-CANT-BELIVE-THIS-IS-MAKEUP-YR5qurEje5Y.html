evaporated I'm grumpy that just went in
like water rich in color rich in life
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well today
I am coming before you bare face that
feeling beautiful I tried to tell myself
that because you know you got to love
yourself even with your full face book
and today I respect some money and I'm
about to do a full face book impressions
of a brand that I've been literally
seeing everywhere yes they have been
paying for those Instagram ads because
they keep coming up on my feet they're
following me and I've been hearing
people talking about this brand quite a
lot and I do think that there's a very
distinctive look to them which I
appreciate and we're about to do a full
face of a glossier right gosh it is one
of those brands that I've been seeing it
I might not sure like you know honest
yeah I rate myself like you know at 6:00
in the morning and maybe like an eight
nine to attend no and I've got my full
face on and a little kick
right I'm not nice right and I see this
brand and I'm like it's like girls who
are wearing makeup but they just you
know they wake up and they just put a
blush on in there and they're beautiful
and I'm like no babes
I need cement on my face like where the
levels were the layers and then also
like they have this not a highlighter
glow it's all my cut almost like a lit
ellipse from within glow and almost on
the verge of oily greasy look wears you
know that looks really nice on models
but on me it may look like I've dipped
my head into a chip pan I don't know if
that's really gonna be something that's
gonna shoot me but today we're gonna do
a full face of cross yeah I spent some
money it's my first impressions it's
definitely an Instagram esque makeup
because that is where I keep seeing it I
went right you've got me you've got me
go see your branding it's work it makes
me feel like I can be beautiful without
doing the most so let's see if that's
true so if you're not subscribed to my
channel please subscribe and you can
find me on my Instagram my snapchat and
all that good stuff and
yeah let's get into it here's my goodies
from glossier I mean it's not the most
fancy packaging I can't remember what my
total is because I'm gonna mix it with
some of the samples that I got by also
use my own money to just get some other
bits and bobs oh it's you you look good
very similar to k'kaw beauty by like oh
it's got little stickers and stuff
inside of banks
oh thanks glossy yay that's so cute the
products come in this this is the
packaging I think everyone's going eco
but I'm not mad I'm not angry okay so
the brand is says beauty products
inspired by real life and you know as I
see naturally beautiful women just
they're looking naturally beautiful and
they even have like skincare and body
and makeup this is product number one
I'm gonna go in with this is a milk
jelly cleanser a conditioning face wash
let's try that I am someone I am dry
skin prone so I appreciate a jelly
cleanse on oh it's thicker than I
thought it would be okay and it's like
new fragrance
let me go add some more water because I
want to see if these like phones or
lathers okay so my face is fully wet and
there's no foaming and no Lovering which
I love this feels so nice on this is
what every wash should feel like every
wash that was a really nice cleanse up
my face feels super moist afterwards but
there's loads of glycerine in it which
really attracts moisture and it's a nice
creme but I think to take makeup off but
like if you have large pores or acne
like that kind of cleanser isn't gonna
do very much for you
AHA okay super bounce hyaluronic acid
and vitamin b5 you don't know how ironic
acid is amazing I use a hyaluronic acid
serum every day and I've got you know
one or two favorites so I know what I
like in a nice hyaluronic serum this is
quite a watery one as well okay
yeah it feels nice it's not as Suomi as
some of my other serums but it's nice I
wonder what the concentration is it's
not really clear on that but it's
hyaluronic acid which I think everyone
should have in their skincare regime so
this is the priming moisturizer let's
get this primer on because my face like
feels like sandpaper right now it's got
a slight essential oil unfilled smells
very similar and feels very similar to
my face base Bobby Brown could this be a
do this face cream is 29 pounds so it is
not a deep it is the same price I mean I
don't mind paying for good quality
products and that is really really nice
it's got really nice lip on it but yeah
it's 29 pounds so it's not a cheaper
product so one of the next product is
literally the most popular product and
it's called the boy brow grooming pomade
and I'm gonna be honest with you look at
my brows just look at my brows so using
a brow mascara just sounds like failed
to me so supposedly I am meant to you
know the the parched deserts which I
call my eyebrows I meant to be able to
fill them in with just this house way
house way how's that gonna happen
let's just see what my boy brow is
saying because I said well okay I saw
some Instagram videos of these girls
like doing it and
okay my brow looks literally glossy and
shiny and thick Oh God you've got
colored it brow going on Oh No I'm doing
it wrong this is a product that is for
those who are gifted in the brown
department and it's not really for those
who have eyebrows that are partial at
the desert like these probably aren't
for you but I'm just gonna try and tidy
your art with some concealer this is the
concealer it is called e stretch
concealer this is also quite famous look
at this I love the packaging everything
about this packaging gives me so much
life this is actually super rich this
might even be too dark so there's only
five different concealer shades but
there are actually three kind of darkish
ones which is very random nope you've
got more leading to the dark side then
to the light side which is very very
interesting but you know I'm not mad at
you go see a go ahead do your thing it's
actually very dark for me but let's just
roll with it
let's make it work I feel like it's
giving me red under brow and it's an
oily red into the brow but I totally see
that my brows do look like what the
brows on the girls look like so maybe
this is meant to the be the look okay
we're not gonna change anything we're
gonna just use the product I do not
understand why why the concealer so damn
shiny why is it glistening like the Sun
I'm gonna go in with the perfecting skin
Tim now this is the foundation what I'm
not getting is this shade is is no
problem it's too dark for me but the
model basically looks like my skin tone
and then the shade up the model looks
almost like mixed-race which is why I
didn't go for the shade that said deep
Oh
bitchy like okay maybe it's a skin tint
maybe maybe I shouldn't judge cuz that
just went in like water did you see that
let's just do this I'm just gonna rub it
with my hand
I'm not laughing someone if I spent
money on Foundation and I look like I
just woke up I'm gonna be pissed I think
though if you're someone he's got really
nice skin you love the Jimmy look do you
know what let me be honest with you
there aren't any lies told what the
imagery looks like is what the product
looks like on SHINee and lights coverage
for those who want to have more natural
beauty let's go in with that stretch
concealer under my eyes I'm grumpy and
grumpy because I just look wet the next
product then says do you affect
highlighter do I look like I need any
more jus right let us
let's power down because this is the Wow
der the weightless finishing powder we
all know you can put powder on and it
will hide a multitude of sins
since the powder nice dark really rich
it doesn't have a poof why don't poo and
again I think some of the powders oh
smart you're too dark I thought it would
be very dark but it actually isn't that
dark and that does definitely take back
their kind of shine and they like oil
look but not dramatically do not before
I continue my face looks far too flat so
I'm gonna go ahead and just conceal with
a lighter concealer and I'm just gonna
go in with my NARS soft matte complete
concealer because this isn't you know I
wouldn't ever wear makeup like this and
what I should have done is probably just
picked up the lighter shade but you know
it looked I was bird of it basically
based on the website and I'm just gonna
go back in with the powder and I just
feel like I need to power there
everywhere cuz I'm just very glowy the
foundations settled and it actually
doesn't look as oily
you can see it's an extremely light
coverage extremely light coverage and
it's not helping with the fact that you
know I've got different color skin tones
on my face which is relatively normal as
a black woman like it's quite normal
okay I like the powder I really really
like the powder because though it looks
dark it's actually it's not other
pigmented so it's taking back the shine
but without making me look orange which
sometimes my Laura Mercier can make me
look a bit orange and also Sasha has a
slight yellow tinge I'm not gonna lie
this isn't a bad powder though they
don't have any eye shadows or anything
so I'm gonna go with this NARS palette
it's just really gorgeous and actually I
felt like it did seem a touch glossy a
but obviously with the nods of that
model I check that out
oh I love this I'm just gonna give
myself a wash of the neutrals okay so
they also don't have a mascara so I'm
gonna go ahead with this : equus girl
which is super cool and I've used it a
few times and really loved it here why a
more natural in my natural beauty okay
what have I got this three different
highlighters here I must have got some
in PR okay let's open these all up this
isn't for me this is more stone at this
shade here is called topaz color looks
gorgeous and then there's a shade called
quartz this is more like a blue this is
just more like a light champagne and
this is more like as gold so for darker
skins I've got I'm really keen to see
that on me let's go okay take mine come
through buddy
it really does just blend into into a
gas because it's gone it's like oxygen
evaporated Wow
let's just let's go again because that
really did evaporate into thin air I
think I have to tap instead there we go
there we go and this product here this
is the blush it's called cloud pale and
the shade is called path oh okay this is
pink pink yeah I mean I'm getting it
it's definitely more like a tint and I'm
getting a hint of that tin it's not a
strong color it's not a strong pigment
it's a tint okay finally we've got some
lip products there is a lip gloss and a
lip paint let's just go in with it lip
pain and again it's a sheer sheer matte
lipsticks and the shade is called
like mm I'm hopeful because I'm seeing
richness in color rich in color rich in
life it's a tin this is something I put
in my bag right all other days where I
haven't got any makeup on or I've gone
out and then I'm not you know what I
need to not look so Ashley I would put
this on cuz I don't need to line it cuz
it's very similar to my it's almost like
a natural lip but just with a hint of
color it's a lip tint it is a lip tint
basically I don't hate that though I do
quite like that I mean it goes with a
look I feel like I've got the glossy
look which is I mean to what makeup
person it's a bit like but I can imagine
to like an everyday girl who wants to
look really natural and really young
actually it's really nice okay let's go
in with a lip gloss this is the clear
transparent lip gloss and I'd die at the
packaging I die
definitely a clear gloss definitely a
clear gloss I feel that I kind of like
that combo go so guys that is my full
face of glossy a maker
I was a little bit hasty I was a little
bit you know critical because obviously
I'm finding this to be very different
from my normal makeup very very very
different and everything here is
definitely like current coverage it is
an attempt it is a tint like I have
tinted makeup on like I look like I've
just been on holiday and my skin is a
little browner and a little bit more
even but not like I have more makeup on
but what I will say is that this is the
glossy a look in my opinion it's natural
it's light it's not overdone and at
least there was there was no selling
dreams on if you go onto the glossy
website and you look at what the models
look like and if you watch the
application videos what I have is what I
got like it is that so it's a very
specific look and I feel like there are
people who this kind of look it really
suits them usually they're very
beautiful with amazing skin and just
perfect features you know bite bite
everyone hasn't their own standard of
beauty so and if you feel like well
actually yeah I feel like I'm beautiful
and I just want to enhance my look
versus completely transform myself then
this is good for you also if you're not
any good at makeup and you look a patchy
hot mess that can be me at time this is
great because you're not gonna look like
a patchy hot mess because it's not over
pigmented so you can just rub it in with
your hands add a little shine here and
there you're gonna have a little
coverage you're gonna put on a little
gloss and you're gonna end up looking
like this I think if you are oily you
could end up looking like you put your
face in a fryer and just was like hey
like get grease is the word like
seriously but other than that when I the
finished look I feel like it looks okay
this is not my go-to makeup this isn't
how I do my makeup at all but you know I
might try it I might got when I go on
holiday I might wear this is my makeup
this is like bring in holiday before
being on holiday if you were to buy a
full bundle of grocery product it would
probably set you back about $200 which
actually isn't that expensive when you
are trying to buy a full
election of makeup because sometimes
makeup concussed into the thousands
so is it ridiculously expensive like the
lip gloss is 11 pounds the most
expensive element realistically is the
skin care which I completely appreciate
so that is my full face of glossy what
do you guys think
should this be my new look I don't know
it's not me but you know what maybe this
is the way makeup is going to be going
because I've been seeing so many girls
like taking these Instagram photos with
their faces just looking where I'm like
have you just got out the shower and
just put baby oil on and taking the
photo with your flawless skin like how
is this the future of makeup what do you
think maybe someone will be rocking the
kind of barely-there makeup look let me
know in the comments and give this a
thumbs up and I will do another full
face of something very soon let me know
what you like to see and I'll catch you
later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
