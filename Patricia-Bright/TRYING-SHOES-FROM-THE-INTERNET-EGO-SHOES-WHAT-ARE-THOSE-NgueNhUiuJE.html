ghetto Cinderella in life where is
anybody government these one of those
wanna know who oh my gosh oh my god
they're beautiful people welcome back to
my channel I hope you are doing well
today
I decided to go onto an online store but
I see all the time particularly in the
shoe department
and you know I'm not gonna lie I can
sometimes be you know considered a shoe
snob
not necessarily a shoe store but you
guys know I have the issue my feet are
on the largest side and you know I've
been called both feet or trap foot or
you know just platypus and it is it
great it isn't great I'm not gonna like
my feet kind of they're alright but you
know they don't get much love because
you know they're not my favorite part of
me because I'm actually only like 5 foot
5 foot 4 5 foot 5 but why are my feet so
extra-long I'm a UK size 8 which is like
a US size my 10 where does it add up
it's annoying but you know what we make
it work so I decided to scoop the
Internet and I have gone on to ego
official and bought a ton a ton of shoes
that I wanted to try we're gonna get
into it ok they had a lot and perspect
why did the stores have to kill me with
perspex
however for some reason I feel slightly
swayed like a almost like per spec
sheets right about now so I'm going to
share with you my shopping experience
and then we're going to try on some of
the goodies now before we get into this
video your girl has been sponsored by
audible so thank you very much
I feel like audible is about to be the
perfect summer time a companion you guys
know I love my fashion and my makeup and
clothing all that stuff but I'd like to
stay educated you know I like to keep my
brain filled just as well and audible is
amazing when it comes to being able to
multitask and do stuff on the go summer
is here a lot of us are gonna be getting
on planes on coaches sunbathing and you
can't always have a physical book I
personally love to listen to audiobooks
especially when it comes to night doing
the housework or doing other stuff
because I'm trying to do two things at
this
time and if you guys don't know what
audible is basically they have a huge
catalogue of books that are in an
audible form so if you don't want to
physically read or there's a title that
you like they probably got it in their
roster of books and you can literally
put your headphones in and listen to
those books
I am currently listening to the chimp
paradox which is all about mind
management and I love finding out the
science about why we do certain things
the way we do especially based on just
human biology and human psychology
versus environment as well so this is a
really really good book that I just
started listening to now as this is in
partnership with audible they have been
able to give me a little bit of an offer
for you guys you guys start a 30-day
trial you're able to get your first
audio book for free so you need to go to
audible.com forward slash patrícia
audible.com for slash Patricia my name
p8 CRI CIA and you can also text if
you're in the USA Patricia to 500 500 oh
it doesn't feel like a salesperson right
now and that way you'll be able to start
your 30-day trial and get your first
book for free
I love audible I think it's fantastic I
have one and it's so worth it so I'm
very glad that they're sponsoring my
video and I think we can now talk about
some shoes
okay different change because it's
actually the next day because I took a
look at my toes I was like no not today
Satan no one needs to see these
so I basically wouldn't have a pedicure
yesterday and then I'm reshooting right
now and I can actually unbox the goodies
that I have from ego this box is
actually insane yeah so this is the size
of the box
it's Mizzou Civ and it's really really
really heavy because I ordered a fair
few number of pairs oh there's so many
shoes in there
oh god oh gosh mm-hmm okay a little bit
of a gray mute I like the color and I
like the texture now they're kind of
giving me dagger but not like major
dagger like it's a respectable dagger
it's not too sharp your eyes will remain
in place but I can't like there's a
little bit of glue visible but okay
sometimes I find that the shoes from
these websites are kind of like that and
I really like the fabric I really like
this kind of soft weird texture
okay oh I love them you you know I love
a mule is it just me you know
I fit slightly I mean I feel like I
could go one size up but I feel like it
makes my feet look really cute the
sphere is it too much of a sphere but
what I've got a say in love is like this
bit it's not too big we don't need to
see the knuckle of the toe and we are
not showing the toe I like this I think
this is nice they're really comfortable
this like like what s material is nice
and soft I like this
oh my gosh so this is nude like crap who
knew there was like crack in a shoe they
had actually a flip-flop a heeled
flip-flop of the same material I wasn't
gonna come up here in a healed flip-flop
because the insults out of throwing
around have been absolutely terribly
real but let me know would any of you
guys he wearing a Hill flip-flop oh my
gosh and then the shoes
made out of lycra well it's a new dawn
in fashion please and no they look weird
but I have a feeling that they would
have looked good on so I need to get
these on it's weird it's like the shoe
looks ugly off but bonnet looks cute but
this is what I love in a shoe but I know
that certain shoes especially mules are
more I can love and hate but on they
look do you guys like these I feel like
there's definitely someone there he's
like movies of really ugly I get it but
I think they're really nice don't ask me
any questions in my life from you or
orthopedic shoes don't ask me any
questions I think these are great I
really don't hate them I think they look
these to me are a teapot these are a
hundred percent of people oh this looks
gorgeous mad SHINee I love the style I
hate the material literally looks like
PVC no it's actually rubber and it looks
rubber but you know what yes it's a
dagger Becca Becca Becca Becca is
definitely a dagger s shoe this looks
way more my size but I think these are
gonna look gorgeous on an actual
dictionary to put on a shoe yeah this is
that shoe you need a meeting in your
next our spreadsheet it's just confusing
so the rap isn't it to go in front of
your ankle how I thought it went this is
how it's meant to go but they're still
really cute do you know what's mad I
actually prefer it the way that I
thought it was meant to go because I
just feel like it's a little bit too
strappy like I would love a shoe that
look like that that's
that ooh we bought a booty oh this is
the nice one
this is nice this is very nice no no
what mustard it is but I like the style
of these these are giving me sex appeal
these are made out of a fabric I can't
wait to see what these look like on I
love the boot I love a boot that's open
we don't need to see too much toe in a
boot because it's been an oxymoron
how can you cover entire ankle but then
show basically to the kneecap like it
doesn't actually work I hate when this
bit is too big be dinky be small be fine
you don't need to see every knuckle on
my foot no I feel like this might be
knuckle exposing let's see what this
looks like oh okay you know what there
isn't too much toe knuckle on show
either
then there's quite a lot of to knuckle
but it's not unbearable it's like my
feet are wearing the Cape like super
shoes oh my gosh oh my gosh
I like these I really like me but if
there's no gap it could be a special
trouser yes okay there is a little bit
more toe knuckle than I would like to be
on show but I can live with it I think
nice oh I know I know I love this style
of shoe but it's in that same rubber
ducky material but it's nice I think in
the nude it looks way nicer I don't know
if you guys can see that I see that in
this new is a rubber duck fabric looks
cute will be go take an eye out with
this we can take an eye out oh my gosh I
feel like this is gonna be exposing far
too much toe okay this one's in a
different but it's my first soiree into
the past
I had to I just don't know how much
support you're gonna get in this but oh
dude I do like the hill I don't know
think I've been convinced enough
marketing will make you like a
perspective
oh shoot so I like I like heat you've
got light it's a belly they're here all
right that's basically what it is and
that actually relatively comfortable you
know I was a hater in 2017 today I've
got an actual pair or Baylor Hills and
I'm living for them now in all honesty
toes have to be looking fresh to rock
these find they're not perfect but I
tried I tried okay this must be some
boots there's such a big one the shoe is
it's like a brick it's so heavy so I've
been trying to get some really nice
wedges for like summertime Cesar and you
know little bit of time and I'd be for
coming up soon you don't need a heel but
you do need a wedge and I thought you
know perspect
but this you'll just sink into the sand
in this anyway let's get this heavy
brick shoe on it's so heavy
I'm so confused I like them you know why
do my feet not fit into any of these
shoes I feel like that's smaller than
normal or maybe my feet are getting
bigger I've seen the register of wedges
that actually nice if I'm gonna keep one
or the other and keeping the wedges
I'm keeping the wedges I've been these
are really nice but they actually feel
really nice on and I love the wedge
version I didn't expect the web version
to look so nice I'm gonna go and pick
these up in a larger size they look good
I love these I feel like these would
look really nice for a day I never
expected them to look as nice as they
look and even though they're heavy
they're quite comfortable who knew I'd
like a little purse back wet edge oh
these are nice and a bit concerned that
this part is a bit too chunky you don't
know these are basically an Alexander
Wang knockoff
usually I and I don't love knockoffs but
these are actually really nice let's try
this on
Oh so on some of the boots the tips are
a bit bit weird be odd or like that as
you can see it is a really weird limp
though this kind of shin length boo I'm
not used to but I think they look really
good on these are more like a winter
shoe though they're kind of a little bit
baggy here looking a little bit like a
trash bag so on yeah I wish they were
more skinny here I've got to tell you
right now these are not they're not
comfortable the arch is quite high but
you know choose I'm always for comfort
but they're really nicely
Oh sexy oh my gos these are like some
red faux suede studded plastic all in
the same a shoe this is a lot of sex
appeal of a shoe this is a sex appeal
shoot basically and I'm not mad at it I
like it I love the red this red is so
vibrant and then this is perfect here
and here I really hope these look good
on these are just giving me appeal I
mean these are a Vegas if I ever go to
Vegas I'm like I'll find myself a shoe
like this to wear somebody that seems a
bit I won't like about them that makes
no sense I know my descriptions never
make sense but there's something that
just makes me feel like Jack Sparrow in
the playroom so I like them there's like
a plate 7 ye toes for dinner no I'm not
enough yuge fan I don't hate but I don't
like love love love that's why you're
gonna wear this like clear like barely
there heel shoes that you really don't
me to see all of this cuz it's gonna be
really hard to wear this with an outfit
so these were the shoes that were
literally all over all over the website
and they look like one
they've knock off Cinderella these were
ever happens in yellow purple black
orange every single color lies that okay
let me try them on what is the height
what is it gasps on these what are those
what are those for some reason I feel
like they're actually gonna be cute on
is that in my head
have I been turned by the past back
lifestyle or is it gonna make my toes
with my claws in high-visibility pink
we're just gonna have to call these
ghetto Cinderella and how it hurts it's
like being each Lea heart to phrases
rights around here but the lycra version
of these shoes were so soft and supple
here is like daggers stabbing your foot
I'm gonna take these as a new pawn now
the plasmids continues in in a booth in
boot form boot form and clear heel this
is what you call trend in a shoe
again these are all over the website I
couldn't I couldn't get away love the
way that there's this like um faux
leather like seam right down now I could
try that the zips the zips are
ridiculous the zips are so ridiculous
for me as a shoe they're just not my
behind just not my vibe they look like a
Wellington boot but see-through and it
with a heel I mean it's very Chanel s
you know she now had their whole
perspective me but I was not going to
spend any of my coin on that no we're
not gonna talk about it we're just gonna
get these on these are this is actual
high visibility neon I think I have to
say Patricia why on earth did I pick
what what why did I pick these up what
are these for
in life where is anybody going
these are these glow-in-the-dark I think
they glow in the dark a glow-in-the-dark
boots
I'll glow-in-the-dark boot it's not that
deep maybe they don't but the way that
this is reflecting my eyes hurt
this is bits of glue bits of glue and
this is the side where I feel like it's
cooler in the dark and I feel like the
holes are required basically so you
don't sweat your feet to death because
you know wearing a plastic bag over your
foot it's probably not gonna be the most
option right let's get this on okay so
in all honesty this shoe is not going
out so I would suggest that you get it
in a bigger size physically can't get
these shoes to go up I mean yeah it's
the gram baggy
yeah but real-life mom no I mean if you
had a shoot and you wanted to do
something that was a little bit
different maybe this to me is not now
these are adorable oh yes okay so these
are basically a faux Balenciaga which I
think everyone's doing these are a
really nice color way if you didn't want
to buy like the actual Balenciaga Thurs
but if you wanted to try a chunky
multicolored trainer this is an option
this is actually really nice I like the
way this look okay
young Balenciaga not coffee do we hate
knock-offs I think a lot of people don't
hate knockoffs as long as they don't try
to be a version on the item they look so
good on I think they're really really
really nice oh my gosh I think their
sizes are a little bit smaller there was
a little bit smaller than the average I
need to go a size up Oh
oh oh they like bouncy they feel really
nice on yet you know these are really
really nice on
I know these are kind of shoe that is a
Louisville hey but I definitely love
these kind of shoes I think these are
better than rich oh how many of you guys
a sneak a gang and do you feel like you
have to wear did like has to be a D - or
Nike or Puma Fila it has to be divine
wha do you guys ever buy a high street
sneakers sneakers or trainers do you
know what if I can get these for 30
pounds 40 pounds why am i spending 90
pounds 400 pounds to a pair of Nikes and
at least you could switch art I think is
a banging okay
okay lovely people that isn't me trying
on ego shoes I don't know if it's called
ego shoes or it's called ego for sure
and then it's a I don't know that isn't
me trying on shoes from ego okay
and you know I feel like I had a lot of
requests to check out ego and another
place Cindy shoes as well and I will say
I was pleasantly surprised I have
avoided a lot of these online shoe
stores just because in all honesty they
kind of remind me of the shoes that used
to get the market and they still be 10
pounds 12 pounds and I really feel like
the shoes that you get in these websites
are really trendy so if you're after a
trend or a tooth of a shoe
listen come on let's hear everyone most
of the shoes allergy they are a dupe of
a designer pair of shoes so if you you
know saw a designer pair of shoes but
you couldn't afford them of course why
not pick up the Juke if you are really
really into it I thought that the
quality was okay there's a few bits of
glue here and there and the comfort left
a lot to be desired but do you know I've
got really expensive shoes that I'm not
comfortable so it's it all varies
I'm gonna probably keep the trainers the
mules I love those mules and probably
the perfect wedge is I know shock horror
that others normally they were oh they
were nice though they look good on I
just don't mean that many pair of shoes
and I feel like I wanna buy a few of its
from other place
i'ma just send it back save my money and
keep the ones that I would like yes I
really really like these would you guys
say where do you buy shoes from do you
go into ego and the other websites I'm
just worried about returning them now
because it's so big and bulky I might
have to keep all these shoes No so for
