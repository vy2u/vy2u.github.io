I'm going to show you my Bridal skincare
regime and it's not just my Bridal
skincare regime is more less than my
general regime with the kind of skin
that I have I'll definitely say I've
been Asian skin but airs on the dry side
and then I do get spots here and there
so this is my routine and a few of the
treatments that I do to combat my
ailment so I hope you enjoy this video
and it's helpful bye guys okay guys so
this is the weekly routine I've been
doing to just get my skin nice and clean
and perfect for my wedding I start off
with washing my face with warm water
sometimes I even do facial steams and
the really important thing that I've
started doing is incorporating a
cleanser which has glycolic acid in it
and this is basically an exfoliating
chemical but the important thing about
this is that it literally gets deep down
into my pores and clears them out like
no other spun your scrub could do and
this is what I really think has changed
the way my skin looks and has given me
that glow next up I use an exfoliating
facial brush which I purchased from the
body shop
and I use this again to get into my
pores having large pores has always been
my problem and now they've literally
almost gone and I just rub it in I am
gentle though I look like I'm being
extremely brutal right here but I use
this on my areas and most where there
lots of imperfections so next up I rinse
and then I apply a facial mask and I use
a moisturizing facial mask because of my
dry skin what I'm using now is a sample
which I got from the body shop and it's
their honey and oat it is amazing it
makes my skin feel so soft when I finish
using it I will be buying the full size
once I finish this one
and after I've applied that I just rinse
it off and stab my face with the towel
and make sure it's all laughs as Michael
decides to join next up I use my beloved
e45 I've come back to this year after
year after year this is my product for
life ever since I had eczema as a child
this is just so moisturizing and just
penetrates my skin so easily a lot of
people don't like it but I actually
swear by e45 it's got simple ingredients
and just those simple actions I love it
you also use a light oil if it's really
cold and that really helps much stops my
face when drying out and I just dot it
and rub it in and that is literally you
can see that I look like I'm glowing and
it's really been great in smoothing out
my skin and giving me a beautiful good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
