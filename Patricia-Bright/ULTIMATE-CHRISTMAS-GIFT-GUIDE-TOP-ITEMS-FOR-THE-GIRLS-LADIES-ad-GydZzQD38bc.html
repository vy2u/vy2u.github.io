have a Christmas gift guide for the
ladies I have changed my look egg eggs I
know this if you guys will notice what
do you think I've gotten long and wavy
I'm getting ready for like my father
days and the party season and I thought
it was time to change it out and that
obviously wanted to sport some of the
hairs from what my new collection but I
have all the info on her coming real
soon and there should be something in
the description box as well but today is
about all the gifts I genuinely and
liking for this season and I wanted to
keep it to like 7 8 maybe 9 items so
that it's not too overwhelming because
sometimes I can find Christmas gift guys
a little bit overwhelming it's almost
just loads of wings and loads of
products just being thrown at you so I
just wanted to give something a little
bit more concise and hopefully useful
and I'm really keeping everything in the
description bar below that I absolutely
love so get comfortable I've actually
got a cup of coffee in here just a small
cup of decaf coffee for anyone you know
it's crazy but yeah get comfortable get
your notepads out like I like to say I'm
going to show you some of my favorite
things so number one is the body shop
who I think are the kings / queen of
Christmas gifts 1 because you get such a
variety of price ranges you can get a
little gift for 6 pounds you can get an
amazing high-quality gift for 65 pounds
but they've got everything you know for
all different price ranges at really
good quality and I think you can't go
wrong with a beautiful bar set for the
woman in your life beat your mom your
sister your aunt in your cousin your
nieces anything like that I think is
amazing now the item that I brought
it has got to be the spa of the word set
and I did a video earlier on this year
using this bar of the word set but they
also have a Christmas set as well and
it's just so luxurious this is a
beautiful box this isn't like some light
rubbish box this isn't a most amazing
box set and inside this it has the body
cream it's got the African scrub it's
got the massage oil it's got a bath milk
as well as a massage stick and I believe
there's a little sticky thing that I've
kind of dropped somewhere that goes in
this set but if you just take a peek at
this this is super high quality and I
believe that they also have when you buy
something in store there's a donation
that is made to charity I think they do
it every year they definitely did it
last year how amazing is this if you
receive this or your mom received it
when your cousin received it would it
may feel like Cleopatra like a million
dollars it looks so expensive these are
glass jars these are really high quality
products and I've been a big fan of the
body shop they keep going above and
beyond with the quality of their product
this is 65 pounds but they also have
smaller sets you can find something for
13 pounds six pounds so many pricing
options but I really do trust them when
it comes to giving gifts at Christmas
time and all year round to be honest
they've got so many good things so I'm
gonna just link everything so you can
check it out but this is like my number
one gift to give a girl this year so
after that loving electronic Beauty as a
gift to give the ladies during the
Christmas time and nowadays we are
stepping up our Beauty regime I am
loving either a facial brush and there's
obviously the magnet tone there's a
Clarisonic I've got the Clinique sonic
system I find this
to be a little bit more gentle but
there's lots of options out there for
different skin types
I wouldn't them in a description bar
below and there are different price
ranges as well you can keep your eyes
peeled but I do feel it's really nice to
get beauty items that you know you can
plug in and use as part of maybe a
pamper routine it's not just an everyday
cream or lotion but something that's a
little bit more special and someone who
might be dealing with maybe different
skin care issues that are more than just
you know product phase something like
this might be really useful to give them
especially if they know that they've
been wanting something like this as well
so after that I've got this kit from no
no it's the hair pro 3 it's laser hair
removal treatment that you can do at
home if you don't know I was having
laser hair removal and I actually eaten
up the results I love these smooth as a
baby's bottom I love the fact that you
know I wasn't very hairy it's nice and
you can do it all over however it is
very expensive for some of the everyday
guards so you can either buy your by the
lady in your life a course of treatment
and use you mean about six to nine
treatments but they are expensive or
something that this is a great way to
start off especially if you have maybe
have on your face on the underarms or
hair in places that you don't want hair
to grow and also it's a little bit more
gentle than shaving and waxing and that
kind of thing but this is a really good
one just worth checking out and it's got
major neat good reviews and people who
have been using it so this is a great
tip option when it comes to beauty
so next up is your classic it's the
fragrances in my favorites I was talking
about the YSL black opium a favorite
fragrance of mine I'm going to share
with you two other fragrances that I
really like it's Giorgio Armani see it
is beautiful my sister put me onto this
it's like her favorite fragrance it's a
little bit pricey and I remember
actually bought a Jeep when I was in I
was in Valencia a couple of months ago
and there's a shop that basically made
fragrances that were based on you know
mainstream fragrances and they sold it
for make the tenth of the price but they
make a formulation but Giorgio Armani C
is a gorgeous gorgeous smelling perfume
the ladies love it the guys like it as
well who cares what guys think anyway as
long as you feel good when you're
wearing something then that's all that
matters but this is a really good option
and then after that it's airing this is
iris meadows I just love all things Erin
it's part of the whole Estee Lauder
group Erin or Erin was the daughter of
Estee Lauder or the granddaughter of
Estee Lauder and I mean the collection
is beautiful just everything looks
gorgeous but it's so feminine but these
perfumes smell divine and I've actually
got a little bit of a collection going
and if you've got maybe a daughter or a
sister or a mum who likes collecting
stuff then these bottles are super
gorgeous for collection because they
have these stones on the top and I've
got like the the brown one the peach one
I've got lots of different colors ones
and these are just such an excellent
just they're just beautiful so those are
some of my favorite fragrances at the
moment and sometimes it's like Christmas
is a great time to buy people fragrances
because I don't feel like people really
do buy fragrances for themselves very
regularly and I'm starting to become
like a fragrance lover I love all of
them right now so next up is scented
candles and I never seen the candles at
Christmas again it's not something I
normally buy for myself but when I
receive them I'd burn them I remember
who bought them for me the stennis make
my house smell amazing when my house
smells amazing I feel amazing
there's something about burning a candle
that can change the entire atmosphere
this is from Joan Malone this is the
wood sage and sea salt dome alone is
beautiful scented candles and I just
love the packaging and everything
most gorgeous Christmas gift and if you
were going to get someone Christmas gift
a girl I would love to receive a German
alone candle I don't actually have a lot
of them I think I only have one of these
so actually I received this as a present
and I was just like this is gorgeous I
don't even want to burn it because it's
just such nice packaging so after that's
got to be accessories I feel like every
girl knows bags shoes or wallets and
stuff for Christmas
and obviously everyone's price range is
very different so let me show you
something that's pricey I actually have
the smaller cubby bag and this one is
about eight hundred and ninety pounds
and this one is expensive but again I
only buy bags like this once in a while
but alternatively you can get things
like designer wallets so last year I
bought or two years ago I bought my
sister a mulberry wallet and she uses
that one in every single day and that
was around the 200 to 250 palmar and you
can also get the non designer wallet so
the French Connection do great wallets
Ted Baker do great wallet this what it
is from mango and it's a really good one
it because it's super large and it was
actually on sale and it's got like the
zip in the middle for coins as well as a
big card area and you could probably fit
your mobile phone on this and use it on
a night out so I saw this afoot you know
what I know who I would have this fall
so nut its tech and electronics and
again this can be a pricey category as
well so you need to look at what works
for you I was going to show two things
number one I was going to show a mobile
phone and I absolutely love the Samsung
edge this is actually my second phone
it's not actually on this is actually my
second phone it's the Samsung edge I
know there's that you know the debate
between team iPhone team Android but
they both have different benefits
and I do find I love the picture quality
on the Samsung but I don't like it so
much for snapchat I love how I'm able to
access my files and what come on I feel
like it's a bit more faster a bit more
powerful and I think if anyone's team
Android then the Samsung edge is amazing
and I'm willing to make the cross over I
think if you can afford to buy someone
new phone or they're looking for a new
phone this is a great option to go for
alternatively there are things like
headphones and other tech and I love my
lammie
headphones I don't know if you guys know
about them obviously people are beats
and stuff I love something a little bit
more girly a bit more feminine and they
do basically stitched stitch headphones
where it's made of fabric around the way
up amazing the sound quality is
excellent and they look really pretty
they also have a white set that go over
my head but these black stitched ones
are gorgeous and they're very very
unique as well
it's got matte black and gold on the
inside of the ear it's a nice little
gold detail so if you want some tech or
some have most difficult for someone
these are a great option so I do think
makeups a really hard thing to buy for
someone especially if you don't know
their color palette or their tones or
what they really like what they haven't
said something too very specific however
I sold this palette which is the Urban
Decay vice palette I think it's a new
palette and I was like I would love love
love love love to receive this for
Christmas it is absolutely amazing
number one you have to see it in the
front but how beautiful is that palette
like it's ridiculous how gorgeous is
that it's a piece of art and then when
you open it up the colors inside are
just gorgeous for anyone who wants to
try something it's a little bit more
vibrant it's great for the party season
but there's also some great Mac classics
or on this side and then some
tronic purples and browns a little bit
more fun but this is like this light is
perfect
every day this side is yes I'm about to
get turned up and I think that this is a
gorgeous makeup gift to get someone but
obviously you can go for lipstick sets
Mac do really great lipstick steps and
brushes are great as well for the
Christmas season but this is like my
best pick when it came to what gift to
get a goal this year joey is another
thing you can pick up a girl and I'm
going to say that I love jewelry from
Urban Outfitters it is cheap and
cheerful so I'm not saying about them
buy some in a Cartier what but I really
like the quality of the jewelry at Urban
Outfitters and wearing this gorgeous
bangle which is Urban Outfitters and
this necklace here and some of my
favorite joy pieces that I get out to
the most about always from Urban
Outfitters they don't rust and change
color
and actually they're between six and
twelve pounds and they're just a really
really nice designs so if you are
looking to get someone some nice pieces
I would Germany go there get yourself a
nice little box put it all together and
you can make something that looks
fabulous for the organizational freaks
like myself a diary is a way to never go
wrong I absolutely live for my diary my
diary is niching like my second child
mustard yeah my second child
specifically it is everything to me and
if I have a pretty diary that just makes
so much difference I think I mentioned a
Kate Spade I read last year as well
because I love Kate Spade Diaries
they're gorgeous and it's just something
about the design it's really feminine
but also really practical on the inside
I think the Kate Spade I always go for
about 35 pounds in the u.s. they're like
$35 so much cheaper so do check them out
they are my favorite but I think these
are an essential and practical gift to
give a girl this year so guys that is my
