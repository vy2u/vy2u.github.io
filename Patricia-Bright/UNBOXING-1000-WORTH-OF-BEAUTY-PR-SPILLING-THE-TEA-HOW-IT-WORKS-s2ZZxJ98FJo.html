it right what in the dildo how is this I
think I made the beer I think many hello
there beautiful people welcome back to
my channel I hope you are doing well
today I have a hell of a lot of stuff to
unbox like a hell of a lot of stuff but
I need to sit down get comfortable get a
cup of tea
I am currently having a green juice
because your goal is being healthy right
about now
that is why my tongue is green if you
are wondering but I wanted to do an epic
up box in there is so much and I kind of
wanted to share like the reality of
being a youtuber especially in the
beauty space I want to give you the
Realty and the lowdown because I don't
feel like everyone always wants to share
that side of things well if I'm gonna
show you all the goodies that I am
insanely you know ridiculously lucky to
receive I then also wanted to be able to
show you know show don't really you
know how you get involved how this
actually works and stuff like that and
also I've only got one face so I'm going
to do a giveaway of a lot of these items
and I'm gonna pick like 20 winners
because I did a giveaway is it in last
month and yet it was really hard to keep
track of so i'ma just make it short and
easy I'll be honest with you I was
really bad at manage I'm doing it on my
own I'm sorry but I'm gonna be really
specific specific in the way that I do
this which I have all the details in the
description bar below and I'll say at
the end of this video to keep it concise
and will keep it cute okay honey's okay
let's get started
let me show you all the stuff that I've
got you might see that I've now got
these massive I can't even pick it up
I've got these massive sacks from Royal
Mail basically because I received so
many packages and they've often got big
packaging so I've got someone who works
at my office who actually just helps me
to take out some stuff from the
packaging and just you know gives me
these massive Royal Mail bag but like
some of the dramatic packaging has got a
girl and that is probably one of my you
know pet peeves sometimes and you know
if
any brands watching I love you you're
amazing keep doing you're playing a
great but sometimes the packaging can be
a bit big a bit bulky I have noticed
that a significant number of brands are
actually doing smaller packages which I
really love that will still be
recyclable as well and at paper
cardboard and down foam and down so yeah
you'll see these are just huge Royal
Mail bags
Great Britain like Santa's Santa's bag
so let's go with Jam which was right
okay okay this is from BH Cosmetics bold
is beautiful brushes oh I love that the
brushes have come with this thing what
is this thing called I don't normally
have brushes that have this that is very
fancy look at that marble and elegant oh
this is a big old sexy brush thank you
so much be it for me I gotta just get
this one out there this is from Too

love really bright pink shape at this I
really hope you guys can see this and
then what are these bronzers and
highlighters I was actually saying this
recently that I don't wear a bronzer

a dark one here a dark chocolate okay
I don't wear bronzer I don't honestly I
think this was in matte eyeshadow

you guys some royalty Oh deal to your

the mascara pump and volume mascara pump

mascara deal with the pink mascara I've
been really loving like deals vibe of
late honestly they are stepping their
game they're getting colorful it's so
youthful now to me in the luxury market
do are the best they're really really
killing it Matt yellow liquid liner can
you see I'm wearing yellow today yellow
is about to be a thing in my life and
we've got a matte yellow liquid liner
deal no look at this
this has just made my life so much fun
so much fun look at this yeah you did
well do you did it really well
I am a fan so how does it work you guys
know I have been doing YouTube for broke
now eight years at this stage okay you
go was trash when she started out she
didn't know what she was doing and there
was there isn't really a broad to doing
this I always say if you want to start
if you want to start today start and a
lot of people message me and they're
like is it too late to start no are you
you if you're you start what do you want
to do what do you like you know what
makes you feel good what can you bring
to the table and they make other people
feel good that's some holographic
full-on plumping lip polish top pose
that's a hell of a long name I'm always
a bit iffy about top coats especially if
they're a little bit like glittery hmm I
like the way that looks I like the way
that feels
yeah this is nice so when it came to me
basically receiving items I'm not gonna
be I think it's a gallant one because
when I started people weren't really
sending people items I remember when I
had like the best collection I was like
so proud of my makeup collection I had
slowly built over time you know because
you couldn't buy every item like that
who's got 350 pounds just to go on
makeup and once it in nil nothing at me
and I remember I did a video when I lost
my makeup bag I was devastated
have any of you guys ever lost your
makeup bags a girl lost her makeup bag
like she was rich listen you can't be
doing this out here and then I remember
that it took me a fair few number of
months to then build those items back up
meanwhile I was still at youtuber out
here so I'm trying to think who sent me
my first-ever beauty item benefit
Benefit Cosmetics I was just really
happy to be invited to get free barracks
to be honest I like is that a brow wax
they still do brow wax services by the
way but you know get a brow rack so I
was like listen life has been made free
brow up and then at the end of me go
into like this talk in this event she
gave me a goodie bag of items from
benefit my mind was blown the garden has
to pay that was lychee by reality I baby
those items like listen listen like
benefit and there's some items that were
really good for me and there's some
items that were but I just you know you
know what it's free just put it on
anyways right in those slightly ashy I
got it's free you know when something's
free it's kind of cute huh so that was
me then let's I put some more stuff and
then we'll keep talking nothing nothing
champagne Oh what's this nail pink
champagne shine no polish do oh I find
that their nail polishes are actually
amazing they're really nice colors my
nails are trashed at the moment don't
even look at them I've vowed I'm not
wearing acrylics anymore I'm done I'm
done with acrylic so I'm gonna be where
I'm trying
not wear anything on my nails for a
little bit and then when they're like
healthy again I'll put something back on
it but ya know dink my favorite and then
this is how you do it you bring some
champagne charm boys I get shampoo this
is from k'kaw Bowie and I think I made
appeal I think I've made many the feel
this let me just drink my green juice I
think these are the new it's dinky
they're very dinky Kim I didn't unpack
these are basically the new lippies
slots it's almost exactly the same as
this I mean there's only a very Marg
marginal difference between the two of
those and what are these lip liners can
we didn't get it right did you get it
right I was saying that I have an issue
with most companies because they never
do a dark enough lip liner that I can
wear so I currently wear chestnut or
bittersweet from Mac those are the only
lip liners I wear but a girl got it
right so moving on as I continue to tell
y'all my stories so inevitably I think
that more and more beauty brand started
to send people stuff just you know
hopefully oh these are problem urban
decay think about what do you have these
I don't know if you guys have seen these
I've seen these in store everywhere when
I was in America these were everywhere
so I started to receive I started to
receive a few bits and bobs free here
and there you know not l'oreal but like
smaller brands so like Sedona lace BH
Cosmetics of the Asian brand started to
send us stuff and then I max became huge
and we all would go to the beauty
conventions and stuff and oh gorgeous
urban decay thank you so much love this
love this I'm gonna give these I'm gonna
give these ones away here so slight to
go to conventions and then
more and more and we would start to
receive freebies I feel like over the
last three years but it's got like
really really big well how do they
approach you the more they see your
content black opium from a wire sell
love this this is such a good classic
it's so amazing I probably already have
two of these when I run out where I
thought I would let you know but I'm
gonna give this away
this looks so exciting who'da beauty
textured shadows rose gold edition this
the new one I heard there was some drama
about like that coming out with the old
product again Oh rose gold palette
remastered oh this is just shining oh it
looks like fire
these are from L'Oreal what lipsticks
for these I haven't seen this oh can
this is beautiful person gorgeous pinky
nude
that's a buff red oh my gosh that is a
really nice way I wonder what the finish
is like on that and then mascara and
then this is so good lip scrub tinted
lip oil into the oil
I've got to try that fabulous and you
know what I think people who are you
know a little bit you know swift be like
something like this you can put on the
lips and also use on the eyes for like
an eyeglass by the way do you guys like
my yellow eyes I've decided what kind of
girl I am I'm gonna one eyeshadow go I
don't need to do several levels of
blending I just need once and I want to
go this is so nice I'm really I'm really
a fan of my own makeup quick tips I
wanted to give you guys for anyone who's
also maybe wanting to get into this
space or wanting to get sort of items
for free
sounds so bad but like if you wanted to
get some items because you're probably
spending a lot of money yourself I think
you just need to have some key brands
that you personally know inside and out
products that you love talk about them
regularly use them regularly be creative
with them and make sure that you are
writing the names of those products and
then writing those names if it's on
Twitter of its on Instagram if it's a
your videos if it's in your blog if it's
in your podcast write it down you have
to write it down somewhere on the
Internet the reason why you need to
write it down on the internet because
most brands use software that pics are
people who are writing the name of their
product it's called sentiment analysis
so what they try to do is analyze what
people think or fill so if they put
emoji happy face emoji sad face or if
they say love this product hashtag
amazing or they write this was crap then
they're trying to work out you know
what people might genuinely think out
there about their product the mere now
I'm actually really becoming a huge fan
of lumière I know it's a bit pricier but
I use the eye cream every night it's so
so good I love it so look at this oh I
don't know what collection this is
moisture the moisturizing cool gel cream
oh right on my street cooling gel cream
even a jar is cold the jar is cold I
don't know what kind of job this is the
last track feels so nice the
moisturizing soft cream a matte notion I
think these are like the sample sizes I
wonder if you can pick up sample sizes
in store that's another that's a trip so
if you guys can't necessarily afford
full product of everything every time
six their samples see if there's
competitions will give away what's this
the shower cap reinvented listen your
God loves the shower cap and a head
scarf this is from shower cap calm do we
really this is some CC yeah 1940 shower
cup is are we really at this point in
time we need our shower cap to be fancy
I'm just getting the mascara baby
this is cute that is actually really
cute I love a good old shower cap and
it's even got a rubber around the front
because you know when your edges just
wanna be going you know you need to keep
them protected this is great more
goodies from now sink oh my gosh this
foil in love and they put on one else
tonight
that is gorgeous for it boiling in the
foiling
love with you that's nice and space baby
he's a gorgeous the big box is here this
is from Karl Lagerfeld and the model
code I don't know what that is oh my
gosh
listen when I tell you that everyone is
coming out with makeup it's mad Karl
Lagerfeld and the model code the model
coat is actually a beauty brand I've
heard of but look at this collection
this is kind of epic you know look at
this brush darling this is a that's
synthetic AF sorry
these aren't good brushes what's this
meant to be useful it's smudged you
can't zoom on to it oh maybe under eye
you could smudge of that let's see this
alright oh my gosh oh wow it's like
lighting up and everything right oh my
gosh
bread's nice little Salo but nice it's
not even a bad red look at that can you
guys see that it's like illuminated oh
gosh okay this is creative this says
peel off why oh there's a mirror that
you actually tried this is really
creative really creative I've not seen
they cement my name is but a mission
well car like logging is basically
Chanel mister Chanel and they've got
some money to do stuff I love this you'd
want to be seen in public
using this okay okay no I'm hoping that
we've got some more power in the pigment
and then this is the eyeshadow palette
do you know what I feel like the Asian
market would love this like I'm not
talking like you know I'm not trying to
generalize I literally just went out to
like a beauty seminar and event and like
seeing that whole market is mad this I
feel like it has been made for them like
Hello Kitty and a lot of the stuff is a
bit more kit a lot of effort has gone
into the design of this what in the
dildo how is this what is this if
anybody knows what this is tell me in
the comments I think we have mascara
maybe that's a brush to brush the
mascara maybe that vibrates but it isn't
vibrating oh to liquid liners and a
stamp a little cat stamp at the end of
it
a liquid liner with a cat stamp at the
end just in case you want to put carl
log those logo on your face
this connection isn't it's not for me
he's not for me but i know someone's
gonna love it I know
bareMinerals released your best glows
bronzer and highlighter palette do you
know what I was looking forward to it oh
that red lips it's quite nice I was
hoping that they had done that I shall
deprive it I've not seen any eyeshadows
from bareMinerals and I'd love to see
what they do crystal ankle oh I love
Berman knows people Oh gorgeous look at
that that's like a rosy gold one that's
so nice this is very bare minimal Z
screen Queen from zoeva so we've got has
been putting out makeup a lot I love it
I am here for Zoe bar I'm a fan this
packaging is to die for it's so amazing
oh oh
crayon nice I'm not seeing this shape in
a lip product for a long time so there
might be some of you guys who want to
reach out to brands to maybe try some
items tests some items and I think
there's nothing wrong with doing that if
you really want to do that you can do
that
but I'm telling you need to have a
backlog of data of work like your own
images your own content something that
shows that you are creative and I think
it's really important to make do with
what you had when my first fight that
listen I was using one sleek one ebay
fake makeup I would I remember I've got
one bitch of me using one big pallet
that I bought on eBay I don't even know
if it was you know FDA approved because
I wanted the covers so you know I might
even advising you don't do that but
sometimes if the may can do and that way
you're able to almost like build up a
portfolio of work so that people can say
okay yeah I don't mind sending her free
stuff because she makes beautiful stuff
with beautiful images beautiful videos
creative videos and not that she just
wants free items and you really have to
be passionate about it as much as I'm
not a makeup artist like I love love
love you I'm not gonna sit here for
eight years talking about some crap that
look like yeah I'm in all obviously cool
no name of getting free products No
I love this edge as you see you like my
face and lights up opening the new
product like I genuine like this is so
fun and then the idea of being able to
get them away try new stuff it was
genuinely makes me really happy so yeah
we got one more bag of stuff to get
through let's do this oh I love this
Tarte this is so cool see the change I
know we cancel tart for a minute I want
to know how long does cancellation last
me this is the kind of shape I don't
count me have in my collection
I'm very excited at the idea of this
shape and then I also love I haven't got
any mason jars so imma still this mason
jar for my own juices

whisper guilt so quick other things just
so you guys know if we are doing PR well
me personally I can't speak for anyone
else if I'm ever doing a PR unboxing I'm
not paid I do not get any money to show
you this stuff the brand's obviously
love it but you know brands normally
want you know their own dedicated like
let me just show you my one new thing
that's what brands usually one and
normally for when I do that it's only
with brother in love love love I've had
a relationship with a long time like
could me or Lancome or Bare Minerals Mac
obviously love matte and then I will
also do stuff for some of the smaller
browser so we've our makeup addiction

advice I was just like willing to give
you guys maybe wanted to know a bit more
about like you know this bit of it like
if you want to work with brands or if
you want to get if you want to be more
in the beauty industry you know my
advice is make amazing content tag
brands and reach out if you want to but
make sure you've got evidence of quality
stuff if you want to really show people
how you might showcase what they have
and you don't have to be big but you do
need to be good and you do need to care
I think that's the most important thing
and I think that everyone recognizes
people
genuinely care about what they're doing
all right I'm going to try and help and
support and give away get goodies from

week so today and over the next week
