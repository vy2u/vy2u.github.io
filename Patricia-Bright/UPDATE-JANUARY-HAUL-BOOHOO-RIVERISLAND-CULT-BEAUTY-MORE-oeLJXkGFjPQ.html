babies are literally kicking like a
crazy person right now do you want to
chill out please hey guys welcome back
to my channel I hope you are well I
quickly want to address the elephant in
the room which is my beautiful cows that
is matching my outfit and basically I
have broken a bone in my hand I broke my
metacarpus metacarpal which is basically
the bone in my hand that connects to my
little finger I basically tripped up and
landed on my hand and then the bone
snapped and broke it was the most
agonizing thing that literally ever and
I've never broken a bone in my entire
life and then this is like the worst
time ever for me to break a bone I was
in the most pain I've ever been in they
were giving me gas and air I was in so
much pain and they're like the littlest
areas can hurt the most and it just
hurts so badly and then I ended up
having surgery on Wednesday to basically
realign the bone I've got pins that are
gonna be taken out so they're kind of
hanging out of my hand right now to hold
my bone in place and it was just
horrible I ended up getting really down
and I I'm not gonna lie to you I have
been on an emotional roller coaster
not really yeah roller coaster emotional
roller coaster
yeah I've basically been I'm sorry I
kinda just understand I have been on an
emotional roller coaster hurting my hand
really tipped me onto the really low low
low side and I'm getting a little bit
emotional about it cuz I was basically
very very down I'm not gonna lie to you
I was you know verging quite depressed
and I basically had a week of just just
falling into a hole of sorrow and pity
for myself and I'll be honest with you
that we all get there we all have those
times I know so many people see me here
that smiling and stuff which is like is
what I'm normally like but I just got so
so down and I've just got these hormones
just making me even worse but you know
what I'm trying and I tweeted as well
and then people were sending me so much
positivity I got so many messages and
everything and everybody around me has
been so supportive and last night that
this like this literally changed my
movement my hairdresser came around and
she's like don't worry darling
I'll do your hair and I've been
basically walking around with my afro
puffs to little afro puffs because I had
taken I'd straight and my natural hair
before I had done this accident so I and
I wasn't able to do my hair and by the
time I've you know gone out in the rain
it just was like we're going back to the
fro and I couldn't put my hair in a hair
band and my hair just was like a con man
I do your hair she did like a weave for
me we got some new hair there's more
hair in stock we sold out so quickly had
to buy some more there's more stock
that's coming hopefully everything
should be in although I think we might
have sold out of the longer lengths um
again already but double check I linked
everything in the description below my
sister painted my nails for me because I
had iodine which they used in surgery
all over this hand and I just looked
like just a crust person but all those
little things have really just helped me
to come out of how I was feeling so yeah
that is the Elephant Room and a little
bit of an update of them what's been
going on but I decided that I'm just
gonna you know let the next ten weeks
and before everything come it's gonna be
everything happened it's gonna be
amazing I'm not gonna let this get me
down at all and I'm feeling so much
better today you know what it's like
when you have a new date just can change
everything
so today I've got a whole video for you
I haven't bought too much stuff but I've
been trying to buy things that make me
feel comfortable I've been loving boohoo
because one they're affordable to them
lots of nice stretchy pieces I'm not
really wearing a maternity because I
haven't gained that much weight um so
far yes I'm carrying so much water and
probably like a full size 10 and before
I was like a size eight to ten and I'm a
full size 10 and I've gained about 14
and but I'm sure I'll gain some more
weight over the next ten weeks and stuff
but anyway I'm going to show you some
the bits I've got a number one I've got
this oversized jumper which is from new
look and I love it I'm loving
turtlenecks you can see I'm wearing them
I find them really flattering on me and
also it is relatively cold so I find
these to be literally perfect I love the
kind of gray and a white mottled detail
on it and it's like it's kind of got a
drape at the front and then I bought
this gorgeous gorgeous car key like car
key bomber jacket as well again I love
the fact that you look so affordable
bought it in a size 10 it's got gold
hardware details and I do like jackets
people who know me know that I keep my
outfits really simple but I love to
focus on having really nice out to wear
so after that I went to River Island and
when I say went to I mean I shopped
online shopping online is it you my
favorite thing in the world to do this
baby is very literally kicking like a
crazy person right now do you want to
chill out please
so I have this basically and buying
loads of jumpers because it's getting so
cold and I feel like I might coat
feeling like I need to be really cozy
so yeah this jumper here is from with
Ireland it's super thick and I find that
sometimes when you buy stuff online
you're always worried about the quality
you never have that with River with
River Island next I am having to give
into the flap as much as I'm a heels
girl but I have these amazing pink
they're not pink they were like a beige
and I'm loving beiges and Pink's at the
moment these are a really nice flat pair
of like Tim soles they're super
comfortable but they look nice and I've
been wanting to go to more lighter
colors now that we're coming into spring
because I wear so much black and I feel
like I don't have light shooter of all
that these are really nice and would
look really nice at the white jeans next
I have this pink jumper again I think
I'm loving the pastel colors right now
and camels and pinks and grays and this
is basically a roll neck jumper which
just shows off your shoulders that's
which looks really nice it's really cozy
it's really warm
I don't know I think for me I'm just
trying to lighten up my wardrobe and I'm
done with wearing black basically right
now so after that I've got this kind of
oversized poncho but it is sleeveless
and I thought it was a really nice piece
I can wear like my nether jackets and
stuff over and I'm loving anything
that's kind of water for style it's
super flattering in pregnancy and super
flattering if you might have like a
little bit of belly that you don't
necessarily want to be out for the whole
world to see all the time and I love the
color palette on this and I can
basically wear anything I want on the
inside which i think is really nice so
next I'm going to show some Beauty bits
I went on to cult Beauty I rarely go on
to cut Beauty but they have so many nice
things and the last time I did my
tutorial I was saying that my Anastasia
Beverly Hills eyebrow gel was too dark
and everyone recommended that I should
go for no more than too dark it's too
gray and everyone recommended that I
should go for the chocolate so I picked
up the dip brow pomade in the chocolate
which I totally agree that's so much
better thank you guys all your
recommendations I pick that up I also
picked up the contour cream palette in
the dark in the deep so I'm gonna try
this out and really excited I bought
loads of like skincare bits like you
know what I'm like skinca is really
important I'm gonna do like a clear skin
routine video for you guys at some point
in time as well oh I also picked up the
mini Paula's Choice
it's the BH a liquid I've been dealing
with my skin's really clear but I still
have large pores like on my nose and
stuff and if I don't manage it it goes
kind of crazy so I'm gonna show you how
I manage it but they have the sample
sizes on top beauty so if you don't want
to spend you know 30 pounds on the full
bottle as much as they voucher it then
you can drop by their $7.99 sample size
which I think will last you like six
months anyway to see what you think
about the product I think that's amazing
and they actually have other sample
sizes as well of different products so
it's worthwhile checking out I also have
the new way of self foundation
I heard Goss talking about this and I
know that makeups going to be looking a
lot more dewy for this year and I'm
loving it because I'm more of an oily
person anyway
you might be able to see and I have the
new foundation in chocolate and it's
literally like my perfect shade I'm
wearing it now and it is nice to kind of
change up your foundations here in there
I also have these new lip paints which
are from l'oreal paris so a nice
drugstore product but it's super
affordable and they've got an amazing I
wish I could open itself right here just
struggling they have an amazing
applicator like this and they're really
really pigmented and really matte and I
don't know if these are out because I
got these in my press samples but I
really wanted to show you guys these
they are beautiful and they look so so
good on this is a lipstick from
Illamasqua the color is called buff
right this color is but it is amazing
it's such a sexy nude that suits all
skin tones the color I'm wearing now
with a nice chocolate lip liner it
looked amazing and in love love love
this is like a literally a favorite so
so glad and loving this product so I've
got loads and loads of bits from boohoo
I kind of went crazy and again it's a
little bit like bit more fast fashion
and stuff but I feel like at the moment
I just want to get things that I've got
to just make me feel a little bit nicer
and I'm not getting any investment
pieces right now other one is sorry it's
gonna be so hard for me to show you I
think I'm just gonna have to show you
these on I have this camel waterfall
jacket and basically waterfall loose
comfortable jackets are definitely the
thing that I am completely and utterly
into right now Comfort is definitely
King it's got a little bit and it's made
of kind of like a fleecy material I
think these are about 20 quid and I
picked this up into camel and I also
picked it up in a white as well I think
my new uniform is probably going to be a
body con jumper dress and an oversized
waterfall jacket in multiple different
colors it's a body con jumper it is
cable knit all the way down it might be
a little bit short for me but I still
you know I'm still gonna rock it I still
think it's gonna look really really nice
and it's nice and body con and the good
thing is that anything that's body calm
but with some nice stretch I can still
wear very comfortably
and then picked up this blue oversized
jumper which can be worn as a dress or
as a jumper it's nice it's oversized and
it's knitted I am the kind of person I
totally developed likes mini obsessions
over things so clearly my obsession is
neat right now and then I bought three
of these dresses I bought this in camel
I bought it in black body con and I
brought it in gray
it's basically a tube polo neck dress
this is an oversized polo neck and I
find them very comfortable to just throw
on anytime you know and not feel like
I've got to put yank this here and yank
this here and I think they're super
super sexy without being too revealing
final piece of footwear I bought myself
some Tim's I was on my snapchat as I
don't know if I want to get Tim's or if
I want to get eggs but I opted for
Timberland in the black and I was really
worried about getting these because my
fear is that they're very heavy and I
don't need weight on my ankles right now
and no pregnant woman needs weight on
her ankles but these are the newer
version which are narrower and lights
are they're actually very very light and
these are more affordable than eggs and
I think eggs are ugly like on a genuine
note they're ugly but why they so
expensive somebody explain to me why I
know they're cozy but they're mad
expensive and I just felt like I was
going to get more value for money out of
these and I might get the eggs later but
right now these are definitely necessary
and they're really cute on like a really
really like how I look wearing it and
they're super comfortable so guys that
is my haul video for today I'm sorry if
it was a little bit more I'm going to
try it and work out how I'm going to
shoot actual videos that I might show
you my left-handed makeup tutorial and
you need to see how long it took me to
do my makeup but I'll probably do stuff
that's a little bit more chatty and a
little bit more fun but I wanted to be
doing videos on Tuesdays Thursdays and
Sundays so let's see if I'm able to
achieve that but you know put the
positive vibes in the air I am gonna be
having an amazing next couple of weeks
and I will be vlogging on my vlog
Channel and that y'all have a
like a roundup vlog on this channel but
once a month so keep your eyes peeled
for that and I'll catch you later bye
