the last minute comm video it is
actually 134 behind me on Sunday the 4th
so if you get this video today this
means that I have been working real hard
right now to get this out over to you
guys but I really have been wanting to
do this video for a while and kind of
just doing a little chit chat update and
stuff but today I'm going to do my
makeup collection tall my closet room
tour and maybe give you a quick peek at
my shoe collection as well and if you
guys have been watching me long enough
you know that I basically go through
these phases of just wanting to clear
everything out and getting quite like
changing things in life that's why my
hair changes like every other week and
I'm just that kind of person to be
completely honest with you and I won't
lie to you
recently I have felt over the past month
I have two spelt like my life's been a
little bit over indulgent and I do get
quite overwhelmed by having a lot of
things so I think this has happens like
the older you get and obviously doing
YouTube Miska you just get so much stuff
and then you just realize you just don't
need all of it and stuff and obviously I
love clothing and that kind of thing and
makeup and stuff but I was like how many
times I'm gonna say stuff sorry guys but
I wanted to have a massive clean-out and
I've been clearing out I've got
literally I can't tell you how many
stuff I've got winners give lots of
charity depop it will come it will can't
beYOU I know I said I was
but I'm just going through that process
now but I'm feeling really good my
makeup collection is literally one two
three drawers in which we will go
through and then my clothing still
relatively big and for those of you who
don't know obviously I'm from England
and even London and in London we don't
have big houses I care none of us have
special wild robes and Krawczyk rooms
but I live in a two and a half bedroom
house I mean my husband live here we
don't have any kids so I have a room
which I'm able to dedicate to like
filming and my clothing and my shoes and
I feel very you know lucky to have that
which is why I have this space you don't
have to do what I do or anything like
that but maybe it's just a bit of
inspiration because I went to Pinterest
a lot to get inspiration for what I
wanted to do and initially I had it made
all open all my shoes and stuff are on
show but I realized and even having my
clothes on show I feel like it makes me
feel like a big butt irritated not
irritated but a bit like uneasy I really
like everything to be hidden away behind
doors and that kind of thing and I don't
know this edit might be quite rushed
because I want to go to my mom's house
for Iceland say three o'clock but it's
140 so no it won't be three o'clock
it'll be probably five o'clock and I
want to edit this before then so let's
see because she's cooking a feast so I'm
gonna bring my Tupperware like hi mom
bye okay so number one my desk behind me
is from I care it is I think it's just a
top I bought the top for 15 pounds I
bought the two legs because I really
liked that shape less and then I bought
the the Castor's they're all from Ikea
and actually in those drawers I just
have my face products my hair my weaves
are in the bottom drawer and the other
two drawers are actually empty right now
because I've got I've cleared out so
much my picture friends are also from
Ikea and my prints are from glamour foil
prints so I really like the one that
says don't be pushed by your problems
but being led by your dreams I think
that's every
and I like the foil print I'll put a
link in the description bar below where
you can actually pick up these floral
prints and then the next about I have I
think it's a mouth but case which is
where I was keeping my shoes before but
I realized I just don't like having my
shoes on show so I now put my perfumes
there and I've got my lipsticks there
and I just have like a book my all my
book so I read it at the moment
and if you guys don't know I'm like an
avid avid reader and I kind of collect
books and then I just have a Chanel box
which has got my boy bag in there which
I really like you know that just to have
that one show then after that I have
this absolutely amazing
Casta is it cool to Caston and if it's
called cast or whatever I bought it from
night for 19 pounds from our goth was it
19 or 21 pounds and I basically wanted
to pull all my makeup in there so I'm
going to go through my makeup collection
so you can literally see it is that G of
my main makeup collection here as you
can see I've got about four foundations
which i think is a sufficient number of
foundations and just just to the right
of me I've got my Kevin a Kwan's I've
got my bed my powders and concealers
from Charlotte Tilbury Estee Lauder and
Bobbi Brown and then in this top here
I've got things like powders so
highlighters bronzers powders and things
value so contouring and my keep my
eyelashes in this corner here when I'm
done with them I've been them and then
after that I also have some palette and
then also my mascaras are Tom Ford NARS
and I think I have clinic here as well
again I don't need more than three
mascaras in rotation and then I have my
brow gel which is from that moving in
this is my final draw when it comes to
my makeup my eyeshadow palettes I have
actually about four Charlotte Tilbury
palettes here cuz I really really like
them I have another Sigma one I have a
Tarte one I have a Tom Ford one as well
so I've got about six pallets in here
then I also have my map warm neutrals
palette just over there as well Mac warm
neutral palette I have my kat von d
palette as well
my Urban Decay palette another Tarte
palette as well and another tomforde
palette so there is still quite a bit of
makeup but there's no need for it to be
excessive I only have one thing and then
over here I have the lipsticks and neck
products that I wear very regularly so I
obviously have make obviously have these
lipsticks here which are some my more
fancy ones are the ones that I really
like but I don't wear all the time and
these are like me literally everyday lip
product so it's doesn't look perfect
but I'll be honest with you it's really
easy for me to use and make my face I
basically just sit in this corner and
get ready each day and find it really
easy to do after that I basically have
hair products and brushes and combs and
all that kind of good stuff in here I
have new things so these are things that
I haven't you know I've been sent to me
or I bought it's called my are their
lashes I've got the new foundation from
Charlotte Tilbury I have some really
good stuff from Illamasqua
I always love their branding as well
it's really inspiring so I keep some of
this stuff in there just to look at
I've got nail polishes I've got stick on
now that I've got some new stuff from
Tarte as well so what I'm gonna do is
I'll go through this drawer and then
decide what's gonna go in my collection
and all that kind of good so that cast
the thing I feel like it's literally a
lifesaver it's only your's and I think I
think this is just the smartest idea to
just have something you can move around
and pull the trays out I can get ready
in other locations and everything is
very easy to see and I just don't want
to have any if my makeups not fitting in
there I don't need it I'm not gonna keep
buying new stuff although I do have some
newest stuff somewhere I think all that
new stuff I have is actually in there
I've been so so good and they have
another poof which has blow dryers they
look like three blow dryers other
straighteners and one about kind of
stuff I won't even dye hair products are
my vice and I've got the weaves all
witch y'all won't here to see because
it's overflowing right now
after that I have the pax collection of
wardrobes and it's basically two of the
larger ones and one of the narrow ones
and I put them together had these since
we moved here but I just changed the
doors and I've just taken off the doors
and I basically have two rails where I
just hang my jeans and my shot and I got
the other one where I keep all my
handbags and stuff like that and then
I've got my jewelry stored
I've got my underwear stored I've got my
house clothes stored and jumpers and
t-shirts as well and then I also have
this draw insert which I really like
because I keep my sunglasses in there
because you can see them it's got the
kind of glass glass chest and then I
keep all my jumpers folded and then wore
house wear and this section over here is
my absolutely newest and favorite
section I have this amazing chest of
drawers from Urban Outfitters I'm not
gonna lie to you I was a million percent
inspired by Viviana does makeup Claire
Marshall as well
and I love the kind of industrial look
and I think those girls they've used it
for their makeup but my advice is it may
cut my advices shoes I realized it had I
think it's gone
it's got 15 drawers and I probably have
about 30 to 40 pairs of shoes and I can
fit two pairs of shoes in each drawer
and I just had a massive shoe clear up
anyway and then I've got something I've
got three pairs in making their sandals
and stuff and then I've obviously got a
rail at the top which has got my higher
heels in there and then the bottom of my
closet I've also got a couple more shoes
so I realized my advice is genuine these
shoes and probably going to try and have
a less shoes and get rid of more shoes
yeah this chest of drawers is from Urban
Outfitters it's quite expensive but
honestly I feel like it's an amazing Buy
if you love your collector of something
be it stands shoes makeup beauty
products jewelry I just feel like it's
the perfect draw as well another shot
that I feel like is super slept on is
BHS I went to BHS which is British home
stores and not sure if all
you guys can get there cleaning for the
stage probably not gonna be able to get
to British home stores buy fake flowers
sometimes I have freshly knees and
everything but I don't always have fresh
flowers it's not necessary for me but
I'd like to have fake flowers that are
good quality because you can get really
crappy off-yellow fake phallus or
flowers or you can get really nice
really good ones
tomorrow on top of the cheese Michael is
making me cheese toasties right now it's
a quick snap before you get to mom's
house and yeah I think that pH has to do
excellent fake flowers and they have
come in the vod's and everything and
fake flowers can be a bit expensive
we're thinking about 25 pounds but they
really do make the room look better but
I have real plants I've got a really big
plan I've got cacti in here but I find
that flowers just die but I try to keep
the balance between fake flowers and
plants where her house is lychee like
plants everywhere has so many plants but
I quite like that and then I just have
these two pieces of lighting as well
which are also from VHS they're just in
this super cute and then I have all
these other little trinkets and storage
from Urban Outfitters if you don't know
about Urban Outfitters home where you
have to check it out it's so so good
they've got so many bits and bobs and
trim to do things that are just
perfectly done like it's so inspiring
when you go in so make sure you guys go
in and check that out but basically that
is my room slash closet tour for you
guys to see I hope that's like inspiring
and this is again I have a space and I
am a youtuber and I do do fashion and I
do do makeup but there's no need to be
excessive and I think one of my key
focuses for the future is being able to
live with less and have a more minimal
life because I genuinely feel like it
makes you feel better when your mind is
less cluttered so that's been like my
key focuses and I feel like I've
achieved it with this Zen space but
