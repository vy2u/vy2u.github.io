everyday makeup routine it's one I
haven't done for a really long time and
I've kind of been going back to the
classic YouTube videos and this is
basically it I know I sound really
bummed out I've got a horrible cold
right now and let me see if it's the
only thing that's like helping really so
apologies for that but yes this is like
my everyday makeup routine and I know
for some of you who might think oh why
should wearing red lipstick well and the
thing is is that when he is like winter
and autumn work they're like I feel that
sometimes my face looks quite dry and
quite shallow and actually the way that
I kind of bring up the way that I look
is basically by doing Brighton licks
that just add a bit of life and vibrancy
to my face and yeah I'm gonna list
everything in the description box below
so enjoyed the video which I'm going to
try and voice over because mmm girls and
boys so I hope you enjoyed this video
and do let me know what you guys want to
see next in the comments because that
would dictate what I do so guys thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you later but I'm currently using the
Makeup Forever HD foundation and my real
technique brushes is to apply so you can
see I kind of just splash it on and the
color I use is n 180 which I really love
because I find it's very rich and very
warm
I love to highlight with a lighter color
and I'm using the Kevin a corn and it's
in a color 12 and I just love the way it
kind of just brightens up underneath
your eyes and I use it to highlight as
well
so these brows of mine
I'm trying to grow them out that's why
they look a bit fishy and they've not
been plucked in a long while but I just
filled them in with a pencil and
concealed with the same concealer so to
basically set everything and blend it
all in I like to use a powder this is a
matte powder in an any w45 and I just
use that everywhere included on my
eyelids so I can add a bit of color and
avoid oily lids I hate that this is a
warm chocolatey Brown could embark from
Mac and I just use that in the crease
and again I use this every day it's not
very smoky but it just adds some depth
and for some reason I can't mine my eyes
as my eyes open so I always lime with
them close but it works in the end and I
always love love love a winged eyeliner
but I'm not an eyeshadow where winged
eyeliner is the way I like to go
so next it's my contour in you can see
my contour kit as well used
it's a sleek kit in the dark and I do
that in a c-shape to kind of help my you
know fat head and I also sometimes use a
little bit of it on my nose so have this
blushful NARS which I must say is
amazing limit list everything in the
description box but it adds a nice
little glow to me in embracing my lips
more but I realized the power of a lip
liner just to add a bit more shape
because I really don't have much of a
Cupid's bow and this color is called
Burgundy's but I added another Brown
just to make it a little bit darker and
this course here is called driven by
love I absolutely love this you guys see
me in this all the time it is definitely
my everyday lipstick color and it just
adds just that value to my look so guys
that is my everyday makeup look you guys
have been asking and I hope you enjoy
thumbs up if you want to take a couple
more Beauty tutorials or anything else
so thanks guys for watching and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
