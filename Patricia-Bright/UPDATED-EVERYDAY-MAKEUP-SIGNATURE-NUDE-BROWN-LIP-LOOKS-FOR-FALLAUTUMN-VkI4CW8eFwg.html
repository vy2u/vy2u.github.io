today I am going to do my everyday face
kind of for the fall and autumn season
now that we are coming into that time of
year so I'm going to show you my
foundation and just my normal facial
routine but I really wanted to show
share with you what I do for my dips
because I get ups on my snapchat on my
Instagram all the time what are you
wearing on your lips to Tricia and I'm
just going to tell you now it's a
combination of a lot of different things
because of the kind of lips I have
they're like big but they're not shapely
and I don't know if you guys know I mean
I have to create shape so I have to
create lots of layers and dimensions a
lots of different textures and stuff
like that and then looking a bit
actually right now but don't worry you
can sort that out and so I'm going to
show you what I like to do and for my
face and for my everyday look it's a
little bit heavier than most people but
you see because I do YouTube videos and
you know go out quite a bit
I wear a bit of a heavier makeup look
just as an FYI so I'm going to talk
through this video and hopefully you
find it useful also I'm working with
half the Fraser lot and their beauty
confidential events they have got 10
pounds of lots of beauty is between the
7th and the 22nd of September will be in
store and online so make sure you check
it out if you want to get from the
goodies that I put in my video or if
you're just trying to update your makeup
collection you should definitely have a
good look there because there's some
great discounts available and I'll link
everything in the description bar below
so you can find out more about it and
the products I'm using in this video
so get comfortable and enjoy so at the
moment my skin is just you know I have
to say it's kind of amazing right now
it's just got really clear and I'm kind
of glowing which I'm loving and I feel
like those and people have noticed that
about my skin recently so thank you guys
and but to be honest I've always had
relatively good skin besides my large
pores which I talk about all the time
which have definitely improved and I do
have quite a good skincare routine I'm
using the Laura Mercier primer and I
never used to really use
I genuinely noticed a difference and
I've started using the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer I
love the applicator with this chunky
applicator which can either put on the
back of your hand or just - in your face
like this if you so desire what I like
is I just think the colors really warm
and actually in the winter I can get
quite cool and and get a little bit dry
looking and I feel like this just gives
me that richness in color and clear you
have a really good color range it could
look a little bit red at first but
you'll see it just starts to blend in
perfectly this is the look I was wearing
in my most recent haul like everyone was
asking me about what I've done it's
basically just this after that I still
use my Double Wear concealer I can't go
wrong with it I love these applicators
they make my life so easy and I just do
basically line down my nose and then
just under my eyes as well kind of do it
like a star there as well oh okay which
is great for me because I'm going to
show you my lip look and just show you
how I create a Cooper's bow as well
under line bear and I'm just going to
use a flat foundation brush to tap that
all in
and then I contour with Estee Lauder's
double we're in a darker color as well
this is called mahogany and this is
actually the foundation and but I really
like it for contouring as well I try not
to contour too too much I just rip down
the side of my nose I just create a
little line to create like a little
button nose and then just like here and
around here to make a c-shape and I'm
applying it a little heavier just so you
can see it a bit more and because I know
sometimes my camera washes things out
then it's all about just blending it all
in because nobody wants any harsh lines
all over their face you know I can just
use my finger on my nose area right next
I'm going to do my brows but I'm taking
my brows for another video so keep your
eyes peeled for that and I'll show you
exactly what I do for my eyebrows and
then once they're done I'm just going to
get on with the rest of my face which is
really quick and really easy so my brows
are done and as you can see they do make
a big difference for my face it kind of
makes you look more human where you
actually have like respectable-looking
eyebrows don't know if you think they're
respectable but they look good oh my
eyes I like to keep it simple I'm using
the Mac palette I think these are the
warm neutrals but there's a corner
chosen everything and for me I love this
palette because you can just do one eye
look you can even create a whole face
with this if you really really wanted to
and it's quite expensive but it's a
worthwhile investment I would say and
I'm just going to use the nude kind of
brow brown on my lid and what I'd like
to do is just to patch that on again
it's a really neutral color kind of
almost looks like my eyelid color
then I'm going to go for the kind of
movi movi Brown up here but this comes
out more like a dark brown on me and
then I always use a swish of God we'll
go for the warmer gold I just kind of
put it in my tear duct and a little warm
eyelid and I'd use a much more kind of
pointy or smaller brush so nowadays I
don't really wear an eyeliner in my eyes
by always wear a winged eyeliner it's
just a thing it makes the eyelashes that
I wear look better and my eyes look
bigger so I have got quite small either
don't know if you guys notice that
sometimes I just add a little dot and
then I'm just going to add some mascara
which always makes some difference to my
eyelashes I've said this a lot of times
I actually have very curly eyelashes so
I'd like to brush it downwards and then
upwards I feel like it stretches those
out and I've never used an eyelash
curler I bought them but I've never used
them and then the blush that I'm using
is a max fever which is a really nice
warm blush warm warmish blush for I
think if you use this on any skin tone
but this one's not too cool not me which
is why I really really like it I can go
a bit overboard on it but oh wait you
know now I'm gonna get my eyelashes on
my eyelashes on I feel a little bit more
like normal and I'm not gonna lie to you
I do wear falsies like every day sadly
it is a habit but I really like the way
I don't put them on and yeah
sadly right so now that's basically my
face done I'm actually just gonna
highlight a little bit and I'm just
going to use a gold eye shadow if you
guys you know don't have highlighters
you can either watch my strobing video
to show what I do or you can just use
which is nice and quickly fee there's
something I enjoy doing so when it comes
to my lips
it's always about combining lots of
different things I don't ever just use
one lip product I use lots of different
liners and they all mix it up so I'm
going to start off by using the urban
decay ultimate zone it's a multi-purpose
primer pencil and I do quite like it on
my lips and I just put this on kind of
like a moisturizer and it really just
helped to make my lip products last
longer and then I usually go for either
a purple or a brown out behind my lips
I'm using Mac's chest mount it gets a
lot of use and I feel like it just
creates a nice Brown I bring it in or I
keep it slow I've also kind of further
it in and then I'm using Laura Mercier's
chestnut it's a pet a lip pencil which I
really like to create a really nice
nudey lip and I just love the way it
looks with pencils they do need a bit of
work
and if you can exfoliate your lips
before you do it so this is my new D
Brown look it's really matte look I just
used two pencils to create this look and
for me I find this the best way to wear
a brown because I feel like some other
browser just made me look quite sickly
or they don't work for my skintone but I
really like this look because it's not
like too full on start round by Ascot
look a bit objected to it so this is
this next I'm simply going to show you
how I move from from this kind of matte
like the satin I'm using the kicks
kiss-kiss lipstick from Guerlain and if
you know me I love a pink as well and I
love to like throw a pink like this on I
do this all the time if I get bored of
the matte lip and then I'll just go back
in with that Laura Mercier chestnut so
just by using that lipstick I've kind of
changed my look this is what I would do
maybe if I got a bit bored of the matte
lip or my lip side to get a little bit
dry I'd go in put this on it changes the
texture completely and the look as well
and this is very simple it's a bit more
pinky because I love a pink in it and
then finally I think my favorite has to
be gloss I'm going with the YSL lip
gloss here and this is kind of a
plumping ghost as well not that I need
the planting but I love the way go out
make my live feel and this is a really
nice nudey colors oh and I feel like it
just makes everything pop because of all
the layers underneath
see that my lips and I look really
luscious I'd probably put a little bit
more lip liner on it so it doesn't look
so you know crazy so guys that is
basically the look with a little bit
cloths on it and I think Goss is my
favorite I feel the most comfortable
wearing glass it's not the most trendy
thing in the world but it feels so good
oh no but that is my everyday makeup
guys it's maybe a little heavy for some
and probably a bit boring for others but
this is how I like to do my makeup quite
regularly and it's just some of my lip
looks as well that I wear on a very
regular basis if you're wondering why
I'm wearing my lips is probably a
combination of these things here so guys
