am doing a makeup tutorial I don't do
these regularly but I'd like to do them
seasonal and you guys know when I was in
the u.s. I bought loads of do bits I
would like the nod store I've got loads
of new bits from listing order a lot of
different things that made me just feel
like saying yes like I want to do my
makeup and I've never been a makeup Pro
or anything like that but more more I
feel like I'm getting a lot better at it
and I'm a lot more confident at it and I
enjoy it like I like putting my face on
and wear a makeup and try new things so
I was wanted to definitely do this
updated video for you and just showing
you what I use I love to use foundations
or creams to do my highlight and contour
routine I'm using Double Wear for like
my highlights and contour I have the new
NARS foundation as well I've heard so
much about this so I use the foundation
and I love it love it love it and then I
also use that the new NARS kabuki brush
which is insane I remember I don't if
you remember my haul video and I was
complaining about the price but you know
what it's worth it I really can see the
power and I'm using it to contour but
I'm also using it to highlight it's just
a really good all-around brush so guys
thank you for watching and I'll catch
you later bye so here I am with my bare
face as you can see I have areas that
are a little bit darker it doesn't
bother me so much this is part and
parcel of having a melanin I go ahead
and use the body shops into the blur
which is a really good primer for
smoothing out your skin and texture
before adding foundation now this is my
new foundation which is from NARS and it
is supposedly one pump I kind of need to
but I really like it because it's really
really pigmented and it's really good on
my darker regions it blends in very well
with my Beauty Blender and just smooth
everything out and I love the color of
this
so for my brows I just go ahead and
brush them as normal I use the dip down
gel from Mac it is fabulous
although mine's getting a little bit dry
right now it really does give me a nice
defined and natural looking brow and I
always like to use a really good hard
angle brush just to give me some gentle
strokes that look a lot more hair like
so to neaten them all up I'm just using
a creamy concealer I'm just - just
meeting all the areas around and then I
also like to use my fingers to do some
extra blending so moving on I am using
my Double Wear concealer from Estee
Lauder and if you guys haven't seen I
had an amazing chance to shoot a
campaign with them as well as my sister
and I was so excited to be brought along
because I've always been a fan of the
brand I will link that video below and
they gave me lots of the Double Wear
foundations to just try out and I love
it and I especially love this darker
color for my contour routine I do have
the normal color Foundation which I wear
from time to time but this is absolutely
amazing because it's just a touch darker
than my skin tone and I can use it to
just give myself lots of definition
along with my highlighting creamy
concealer and I just use my Beauty
Blender to blend that all in now I don't
do this all the time this is if I'm
going out or wanting to do something a
bit more dramatic but I really love the
finish results now to be honest lots of
time needs to be spent blending to make
sure it looks great and you don't have
any harsh lines but I do that and I'm
using my NARS it's a kabuki brush this
brush is ridiculously amazing if you
guys remember I complained about this
brush no no no no no more I complain
this is a miracle brush so I use it to
blend in all my harsh lines and then I
go ahead and use another brush to just
you know make sure everything's nice on
that and then go ahead and use my Mac
neutrals palette I love pilots like this
cuz I can use four colors and I'm done
and dusted sometimes I only use two I go
ahead and use come and I can light a
beige on my lid and then the darker
Brown in
crease it's so easy to do I mean I don't
really like wearing a lot of eyeshadow
but I also add an additional bridge
color and just blend it all in with this
fluffy Charlotte Toby brush and I just
added a little bit of a gold touch
directly on my lid and I go ahead and I
use my mascara and I hate lining my eyes
but I love the way it looks when it is
done as I do them closed I am just gonna
do a gentle wind liner because I'm
wearing lashes now these lashes are the
lower lashes and the mink lashes these
are ridiculous
okay so many people have noticed and
been asking me recently about what
lashes I'm wearing it's these they're
insane I love them I'm not just saying
them I feel so pretty in there and
they're very very light I'll link them
in the description bar below I go ahead
and add some gold in my crease and then
highlight with my Charlotte to avoid
cheek and pop sadly it's all crap so I
can't open it up but it's absolutely
gorgeous
and go line my lips with this gorgeous
line up from Barry M this is totally a
dupe of night moth and I'm going to use
one my favorite new lipsticks from nas
so this is a really good kind of bridge
transition because the color for me
really does need a liner but it's so out
of this world
ridiculous I'll link it in the
description bar below but it is the
prettiest nudey pink I've ever seen and
yeah I just put that on this color makes
it look a little bit weird but it is
absolutely flawless and it's my favorite
color right now so that is basically my
finished look I'm not even gonna bother
brushing my hair and but that is my
updated highlight and contour routine
and I hope you guys enjoy have a great
weekend and I'll catch you all later
thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
