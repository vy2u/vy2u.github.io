today's video is gonna be kind of a
little heart-to-heart a little bit of an
update I don't prepare my videos
beforehand but I kind of have an idea of
what I'm going to say in my head but I
kind of just wanted to you know come to
you via and kind of tell you what's been
going on in my life and stuff and I feel
like there are always opportunities to
give a testimony or to say of the good
things that happen in our lives as I
know that it's encouragement to other
people out there so you guys may not
even know well this is kind of a vlog so
anyone who's not into vlogs never bother
watching this video but I was actually
made redundant and if anyone knows what
that means is I was kind of sitting at
my desk in yakking tape and I'm called
and it's like you know we're gonna tell
you that right now the markets are then
I love that you guys kind of know where
I work the markets are bad and you know
we're needing to make operational cuts
that means people are going and the
company I worked for is cutting tens of
thousands of jobs at the moment and mine
was one to go and it was quite a bit of
a war okay I'm about to get married I'm
trying to buy a house I've already
booked a really expensive honeymoon and
oh my gosh what am I gonna do well the
feeling that kind of came over me at
that point in time just because I me and
my family we're covering our costs
ourselves like we're not we don't have
any credit cards or anything like that
so it was a really shocking period of
time and that was about two months ago
and I didn't mention it before because
I'm the type of person that I I always
like to remain positive I hope that you
can see on my channel like the only
invite I bring to my channel is
positivity and like a spirit of joy and
a spirit of peace and I feel like I
always want to exhibit that because
that's what I always want to embody and
even though sometimes you may be down or
you may be frustrated I may be down or
frustrated and unhappy like I like to
kind of go past that you know go past
that and actually you might YouTube in
anything
another opportunity for me to express
and give love in the form of like my
positivity and fashion and beauty that
is how I feel to give love and how I
feel to express myself in that way so it
was hard times got girls and boys you
know I was I was really you no doubt
about it but I will say actually I'm
somebody I like to keep a split of faith
and I have to you know thank God for I
knew I'd have a testimony to come and
say to those of you who've graduated
from university and don't have a job yet
and you're just sitting at home you're
like where's my job you know my sister
it took her a year to get a job she did
not lose faith though she she's got a
job now as of him about a month or so
ago in exactly what she wanted to do and
you know it can be really stressful at
times and you can get really really down
about it but sometimes you've got to
hold faith and you know I believe life
and death is in the power of the tongue
so speak life and even though I wasn't
as jobless I was on the armored guard
and jobless I'm a-thinkin oh no I don't
speak like that I speak positively and I
I remain firm that you know something
good is going to come my way in that
those who wait and trust will receive
and I hope that my story can be an
encouragement to anyone out there who
maybe its kind of looking for a job
right now they don't know what they're
doing they don't know which way to turn
you know the market looks crazy
sometimes you have to forget what's
going on forget what's going on on the
news and stand firm in some form of
faith stand firm that do you know what
whatever the world may say whatever is
going on out there does not apply to me
and that's the testimony that I have
today though that although you know
loads of people looking for jobs you
know it's really bad out there
whatever I've got one I was made
redundant I suffered for that period of
time and I'm here to tell the tale but I
survived and the rest of you guys out
there you will also be able to survive
so that is the first thing that I wanted
to let you guys know just
be a bit free and a bit easy just to let
you know where I have been in my kind of
life at the moment
what else did I want to tell you okay so
moving on I want to tell you just mix
it's random but I'm sick and tired of
wearing hair extensions it's just
actually irritating and I say that
because my sister just got the most
amazing pixie cut ever and I'm just like
draw like she just wakes up in the
morning like Shh
head done and I would just love love
love that so I'm gonna be getting my
real hair cut and for those of you who
don't know I have another hair channel
but I will be shutting that channel down
for anyone who watches it because I just
don't I don't upload and I don't you
care about this whole hair journey
anymore so - you're annoying and
irritating so yeah I'm starting off and
I might do maybe another hair channel
that is focus more or less on styling
but I will let you know thirdly webbing
up there it's a really really miniature
update but so I decided that I'm going
to get my makeup done by a professional
and I have some video footage of where I
went and had my bridal face done I'm
probably gonna change to the look but if
you would like to see that video leave a
comment below you could see I got it
done in Mac and I'm gonna get the guy
who did my makeup to do my makeup on my
wedding day hopefully and so I if you
want me to I can upload that video for
you guys to have a little look look like
as a bridal Queen what else is there to
tell you oh yes so I want to address you
know negativity on my channel and do you
know what the thing is when you put
yourself on a public forum like YouTube
or just anywhere there are good people
who are gonna have something to say and
I think I was I was watching a video by
style Dyer and it seemed that someone
else had been bullied off YouTube
because of a statements being made to
them no that can never happen to me now
I'm pulling it off but you know I will
make it very clear that I don't stand
for negativity I don't stand for racism
on my channel I don't stand for people
brushing or swearing at each other on my
channel I hate swearing I think it is
just foul and just a useless way of
communicating it's just the poor form of
speech and like there's a lot of you
know people and I love it when people
defend me and everything don't swear in
defending me okay god bless you but and
all those people all of a sudden there's
these bunch of crazy racists who they
always come and they just it's like they
come one after the other I block one
another one comes this crazy racists who
come
commenting on my video i'ma directly
their time they seem to me black males
American and I find it really really
strange but I'm not gonna stand for it
and it doesn't actually bother me in any
way shape or form so you're just wasting
your time behind your computer
leaving me negative and racist comments
I'm not affected and who all that know
let's keep it light let's keep it
positive let's keep it airy this video
is in the update oh and I also have do
you wanna see or haul video
I just watched some random bits and bobs
for my skin because I've been as I said
I have been quite stressed out about
what I've been going on I just fight
like oh my gosh I need a detox and
everything so obviously I go shopping
when I need the detox and I got some
other bits and bobs with child clothing
or like fashion II but there may be of
interest to you just random bits if you
would like to see that let me know and I
haven't load the videos but I would like
to do I have the vision or blows and
loads of videos in my head so should I
just do them and upload them every day
before the new year or should I just
leave them you let me know leave a
comment if you'd like to see those but
this is just an emotional randomest
update fo but I just felt like being
open and just you know spreading and
letting you know the good news of how I
feel I feel like I kind of owe it to you
and I owe it to God to just testify of
his goodness in my life I know guys I'm
done thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
