thought I'd do an updated what's in my
bag as I've got a new favorite bag which
is my zarbor got you guys seen we don't
always talk about and I'll just show you
what's in there again today the first of
all I have skin cleansing wipes for
those of you don't know I actually
rarely wear makeup like in the week and
like when I'm going to work I just can't
be bothered I'm really really lazy and
but if I want my face I feel kind of
fresh and renewed again I might use a
facial cleansing wash and facial
cleanser wash facial wipe and that just
kind of makes it feel less clunky and
crusty so I have one of these I'm
sticking with like skin care products I
always now carry sunblock with me and
it's Rick I've been reading some crazy
stuff on my clear skin and skin
brightening and like the essentials of
skin care I probably do a video on it if
you want me to but sunblock is now
literally even though I live in London
even though it's rainy it's an essential
for amazing skin and I'll talk about
that in another video so I have this
small mini Nivea one which is like the
factor 30 and some people may say you
don't need that to 30 I'll tell you all
about it later if you want me to and
then again if I feel kind of like dry or
just crusty in the face I have this elf
like it's a facial then if it's a facial
water or something like that it's all
rubbed off but this was like $1.99 from
ELF but it's really nice and if I'm
going to apply makeup I spray this first
like if after work I'm going out and I'm
gonna put makeup on I'd spray this on
first and then I start to prime my
makeup and it gives me like a really
nice chewy finish and rather than my
makeup going on really powdery and dry
um I carry a hair moisturizer with me
like rarely not this one is well this is
just a placeholder I'm not home so I
don't really have the majority of my
stuff with me but I usually use the
hello hydration leave-in serum which is
by
Herbal Essences
and I just like to spray it and then
just put it on the ends and it's really
really nice moisturising without being
greasy or oily hair pins just like to
carry them with me for my hair is
starting to annoy me
I might pin it back or something like
that just to make it look nice if I
don't like wearing my hair like up
because I don't like my head shake
because it's so fat
we're having a discussion about this in
another video but you guys now have a
complex ok these so when I go to the
station in the morning I go into like
either London Bridge or Victoria now
someone's always giving out freebies yes
I love freebies and Aveeno they're
giving out the skin relief sheer butter
moisturizing lotions and like Mitch I've
got like one two three four meant for
four in here but I have my ten it might
draw work and stuff so yeah these are
really good for my hands for my face if
I feel dry and I really really like it
out but I would actually buy the full
bottle of the Aveeno moisturizer because
it's really really good okay I carry a
paddle brush again for brushing my rocks
and this brush I've raved about it from
before
it's from boots it's a powder brush and
it's just so good at just getting
through any kind of tangles and it gives
you a really smooth finish without
pulling out hair I really really love
this brush I'd recommend it was about
ten pounds maybe but I think it's worth
it definitely some reason I have a
shower cap in my bag now this is
probably from when I was away and I just
let you picked up so a shower cap I
don't use it when I'm on the train or
anything like that that would be weird
but it's there okay so my cos watch I
don't actually wear watches I don't know
why but sometimes I like to put this on
just for decoration or to look a little
bit smarter but I keep it in my bag the
majority of the time so if I want to
throw it on I can so I always look at my
phone for the watch and but it's just
nice to have so that watch always is in
my bag nowadays a young person's
railcard I'm no longer a young person
and
but I still have one mine's gonna expire
shortly and this basically gives me
discounts on trains and day travel cards
if I'm not buying if I'm going to
McMahon chest or something like that so
I always carry this in my bag because if
I bought a day ticket and you don't have
one and you buy a young person's rail
cars you will be fined and these people
do not play London Transport I mean I've
got a Vaseline lip therapy now I was
using comics right but I started to find
that comics was making my lips peel
really really badly I've had been
suffering from desperately dry lips as I
bought the Vaseline one and to be honest
Vaseline has always been my resolution
for anything and I've been using this
one and I loved it and so far so this
isn't my bag I showed you this the last
time boys and girls it's manhandles it's
mine and those have another chicken I
sent me of these cards they're like
literally littered everywhere
and I always keep on with me and a
couple of receipts so I can get free
chicken yeah I'm a bit of friction ooh
what's this a caustic coffee card I
think this is a free coffee but I don't
even drink coffee I don't know I took it
maybe I would swap it for a tea a
hairbrush I never used to use these
brushes on brushes but I started using
them because I love the way their skin
is smooth silky smooth edges and a bit
of moisturizer just push those snaps
back you know some tissue you don't need
to see that it's not use it's just
crunched so what I would definitely call
would be my Bible which is my diary and
a pen I can't do anything without a
diary and a pen you just see it's like
field of notes filled your ideas
literally my day-to-day life is just in
this diary
well I love a bit of diary and me might
have matching Diaries is that weird
probably is what I don't mind and a pen
or this goes with the diary I don't know
how I lived without one of these it's
ridiculous
so I've also got my makeup bag again I'd
say I actually really don't wear much
make up like outside of YouTube I'm just
lazy but I can't be a makeup bag of me
just in case like if I've got them from
going to a meeting something else I
wanted a kind of human or I'm going out
after work I might just throw on some
makeup here but I don't keep a lot with
me I'll just have like my powder my Mac
powder it's the studio finish in the NW
45 or I have one mineralize and once I
spray that elf spray on literally
there's just over my face without being
drying really quick and like my savior
is my concealer where is it I can see
like it's in in NC 45 oh it's in an NC
45 and yeah it just literally brightens
up my under eyes and just makes me look
fresh in you again so yeah this is one I
definitely always have mascara always
makes my eyes look bigger and I always
keep a variety of lipsticks in here not
just one type of lipstick right I've got
favored a glam in there ive got this
vintage rose I've got loads of pinks and
stuff and this papaya punch by sleep and
a little blue tin which is more or less
Vaseline as well so that's what's in my
makeup bag that when I go out so it
isn't that much I just can't be bothered
to carry loads and other stuff I also
carry my mobile phone with me now this
isn't my mobile phone well it is for the
moment I actually have my iPhone stolen
out of my other bag yet when I was
coming back from the travels and I have
this temporary frame which is actually
really crap yeah really we old but you
know it does a job I can receive cause
that's what man is and I can make calls
on it so my mobile oh and I also have
this Mac quad with me which has some
colours which I definitely think are
just basics if you're going out and you
want to add a bit of sparkle to your eye
I've got um that's rice paper there some
formal gold think that's
down down I'm not sure and I don't even
know what that color is they're never
use that but yeah I keep that with me as
well and I blushed by sleek this is FN
berry which is acid dark flash but with
a hint of like weird and stuff to it so
this is nice and it kind of contours as
well and for some reason I have two
purses in my bag
I think this purse has got more like
I've got a macro card I've got a body
shop card nectar cards don't even shop
in Sainsbury's very much
oh that's it so I don't know I've got
two in there maybe there's like notes
and stuff in there and then I've got
this one here as well this one actually
just my mum gave it to me and I use that
on the travels it's very good for
putting coins and buzzes is it let's say
let's hit my bag next you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
