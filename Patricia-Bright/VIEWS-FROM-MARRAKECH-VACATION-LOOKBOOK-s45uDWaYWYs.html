is my absolute vice and I travel to
Marrakesh a couple of weeks back and
stayed at the most beautiful Four
Seasons Resort and I thought I'd do a
little bit of wind-up work that you guys
could watch and enjoy and hopefully get
some inspiration from so I must say that
the lobby was like all inspiring and I
had this two piece suit which is from
H&amp;amp;M and I really shop at H&amp;amp;M but saw
this and was like this is amazing I love
the vibrant colors and I thought it was
beautiful for kind of the desert vibe of
Marrakesh so I'm not gonna lie we didn't
get much done in the day because it was
so hot fifty degrees centigrade so we
had to be driven and we had the most
amazing driver who took lots of care
about yeah
most evenings we basically went out to
get food at the big square which is like
a traditional place where you can get
henna done you can buy things from the
street vendors and my biggest tip for
everyone is just to be careful and
ensure you ask about prices first but it
had a great vibe as you can see the
grounds of the resort are just beautiful
the four season Marrakesh is just a
place that always have a soft ball in my
heart but I've been an amazing stay and
I felt like I was central to everything
but it was my little oasis away from the
heat and the hustle and the bustle of
this city
going to the yl memorial was beautiful
as well just going into a place with 70
memories in history was just lovely so
much greenery and it just seemed really
peaceful especially knowing that this
was his home prior to passing away I was
truly inspired when my favorite outfits
while I was away was this white dress
from Zara it's really affordable and
really simple but I just bought so fun
and free in it it was gorgeous and I
just paired it with my Valentino's just
to add a touch of glamour
so when it came to walking through the
city I was always looking for the
nearest shade but I'm going to say
honestly on every corner there's a
picture-perfect location
I'm just wearing my Topshop top my
Levi's jeans and a waistcoat that's from
Topshop and just sandals from office so
most of the time and we stayed at the
hotel and then got ready in the evenings
to go out but probably I got dressed up
far too early because it was too hot at
this time but I love this jumpsuit which
is from misguided it's so simple but a
little bit risque as well I paired this
with my little Gucci purse which is a
favorite of mine and these are basically
the only heels I bought on holiday with
me
most evenings were always a great time
to go out and there's so many different
hotels and restaurants to go to
I loved going to the restaurants where
they had a belly dancing and dancing
because I always get involved so guys I
hope you enjoyed that video it's just a
little view of my time in Marrakesh that
was beautiful and I hope it gave you
guys some inspiration thanks for
watching and I will see you on Sunday
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
