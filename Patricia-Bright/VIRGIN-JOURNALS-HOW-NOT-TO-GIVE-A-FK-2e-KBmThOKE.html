have finally got a chatty video for you
and I'm starting a new series called the
virgin journals and it's not necessarily
in relation to sex some shall' which
lots of you guys are thinking but it's
in relation to one some of us who are
new to this thing called adult life and
to those of us who are kind of on that
edge between you know what I kind of
need to grow up now but I find it hard
and the things that I wish I knew and so
I wanted to share some of the insights
that I had while I feel like I'm
definitely you know a virgin to so many
things and also I'm just on that edge as
well and I've been really like holding
back on doing like talking videos
because I kind of went for a phase of
feeling like well I don't necessarily
know what I have to say I'm not an
expert in anything but you know what
everybody has something that they can
bring to the table be it maybe it's
somebody else and I wanted to bring my
salt and pepper to this earth I'm
hopefully gonna do these either weekly
or bi-weekly that kind of thing so keep
your eyes peeled but today we are
talking about how not to give a now I am
NOT someone who swears but I feel like
this was the word that had to be used
for this and I'm not going to use the
word throughout this video because it's
just not lame like for me personally but
I feel like it was something I really
wanted to talk about because I felt like
I was someone who started to care so
much and when you care so much about
what people are saying about you what
people think about you
who's doing what over there who's not
doing something you get to a place where
you can become very very stifled and I
found that I've had begun stifling
myself and I was so concerned with am I
making the right move and that I would I
made the choice to not do anything it's
like I just kind of got stuck and they
call it analysis paralysis where you
choose to not do anything because you
are worried about the next decision and
I found like because I was caring so
much I was giving far too many that I
was just like
I don't know what to do I'm not going to
do anything to avoid hurting myself
avoid you know being talked about avoid
it being criticized avoid being judged
and it just was like something that I
was like no this has got to stop and I
realized that it wasn't just me it was
speaking to so many people my cousins
and my friends and realizing that we're
living in a world where everyone's got
something to say there are so many
opinions flying around and not just if
you are you know on the internet or on
YouTube like I am it's all of us because
we all put ourselves out there now and
we're all prone to being kind of
second-guessing ourselves that when we
put something out is what is someone
going to think what are they gonna do
even for some of us who are dating it's
a case of you know what is he doing does
he really like me like you have these
concerns that just sit in the back of
your head
worrying away and kind of getting in the
way of you actually making the right
moves for yourself so today I was like
no we're not going to do that anymore
ladies are we so I wanted to give you my
tips on how not to care now not to feel
that fear and how to be able to kind of
move on and not be paralyzed by all
these concerns so my first step is to
accept and to acknowledge and when I say
that I don't mean that in a defeatist
way I mean in the realest way what you
have to do is be realistic about life
right there is good
there is bad there are going to be
people who are going to like you and
there are going to be people who are
going to love you there are going to be
people who think the Sun shines out of
your behind and there going to be people
who are like oh my gosh that girl is
absolutely awful or that guy is just
awful and know what this is part of life
right good and bad happens that
relationship you might have might have
been amazing on one relationship that
you might have might be awful there's so
many different situations that happen
and this is the yin and yang to life
once you realize that the beauty of the
world that we live in is that it is
black and it is white and it is red and
it is blue and it is purple and there's
variety
the more you are able to keep it moving
and actually not be concerned and you
can never expect your outcome to
constantly be great okay so what you
learn to do is to roll with the punches
so my next tip when it comes to not
caring so much is to affirm yourself as
human beings we love affirmation we are
told we are amazing by our parents and
we expect that throughout our entire
lives and there is nothing like kind
words that will lift a broken spirit
this is a matter of fact it will make
you feel good when someone says you look
beautiful it will make you feel good
when your boss says that piece of what
you did was amazing however if you're
going to sit back and wait for someone
else to constantly affirm you you might
be waiting a long time if you're wanting
that BAE to say girl your body looks
fine and you haven't got that BAE then
you might not think that much of
yourself and I say this all the time
speak to yourself affirm yourself
there's nothing like visualization and
saying those things that are not as
though they are like I'm amazing I'm
successful I am smart I am educated I
have aced that exam telling yourself all
these things will lift your spirits and
actually the more you say it the more
you'll genuinely see these things in
your life to generally take the time to
affirm yourself and it doesn't make you
crazy okay all the greats do this my
sister just said sidebar but you haven't
revised for the exam don't expect 100%
marks you okay let's be real with it
let's not just be delusional but it's
okay sometimes to be a little bit
delusional so my next tip is to expose
yourself expose yourself to the thing
that you're scared of to things that
you're concerned about even me sitting
here doing this video right now I got to
places like I really don't want to talk
too much or I don't want to share too
much because I felt like sometimes I
come across as being too opinionated and
know-it-all and these are things that I
think about myself and I've heard said
about me and
kind of made me kind of draw into myself
to say you know what maybe I'll just try
and be boring and maybe I'll just be
quiet and maybe I won't share an opinion
but the reality is I am opinionated okay
that okay that's who I am okay I do have
things that I might want to say to
people I do kind of say what I feel and
sometimes it comes out a little bit
awkward but that's okay to expose
yourself to the thing that scares you
and it might be that guy you know you're
worried about approaching that guy or
speak to him or you're worried about
applying for that job because you don't
think you qualify for it you're afraid
to speak up against something you don't
agree with expose yourself to do it I
talked about Susan Jeffords feel the
fear and do it anyway I talked about
don't sweat the small stuff there's so
many books out there on exposing
yourself having fearlessness is like a a
muscle the more you exercise it the
stronger you get at it right the more
you do things that scare you the more
fearless you become and when you'll feel
this you can do absolutely anything and
I'm smiling because I'm like Patricia
you know how about to become fearless
outlet are you lot ready I'm genuinely
true expose yourself to those things
that genuinely scare you and you'll
realize that they're not as worrying as
you really thought there were or you
might be better at dealing with those
things that you thought were going to
really break you and they don't it just
makes you stronger so don't worry about
being exposed to it
my next step to not being so concerned
is to focus outwardly we are living in a
world where we have and I put my hands
up and I'll say I have been self
centered self focused and selfish we
live in a world where we spend so much
time looking at ourselves analyzing
ourselves and we spend little time
focusing on others in a positive way how
can I help you how can I serve you how
can I make your life better how can you
do something for someone other than
yourself and there's nothing like you no
I'm not saying that you have to go and
do outreach on the streets and homeless
runs but you can do that
if you want to there are plenty of food
banks in this country that need
volunteers and there are loads of things
that you can do though it might be from
a case of babysitting for your friend it
might be bringing in a package of sweets
for your classmates it might be a case
of helping someone with their homework
or creating a study group but for the
people in your course do something
outside of yourself one because it is
invigorating and two because it
distracts you from being so concerned
about your own ish and you'll actually
realize that sometimes your own stuff
isn't as bad as what someone else might
be going through so genuinely take some
time to think outside of yourself my
final tip is to stay in your own lane
and to focus on your own race and me my
sister we're having this chat about the
analogy of a sprinter a sprinter
although there might be five people
there and five people there and they're
racing against each other but a lot of
the time sprinters how they're
successful is because they're trying to
beat their best time it's not about what
Jimmy did over there it's not what about
Mary did over there it's about me or you
doing it better than you've ever done
before and even if a person loses a race
but they've done ten seconds better than
they've ever done in the past that is a
massive win and it's very hard to be
focused and go ahead if you're looking
left or right or you're worried about
his shoelace or her shoelace while
you're tumbling over it doesn't matter
seyton your own lane and keep focused on
your own race and that will make a
genuine difference to your life you
don't need all the distraction you just
need to stop giving a so guys I hope you
enjoyed that video I get passionate in
these videos as I always do but I hope
you find it useful to really kind of
kind of shake your shoulders you know
that a weight of concern a weight of
what's Mary doing or maybe he's cheating
on me who cares like not I mean be free
let yourself live with
enjoy yourself so I hope you find that
useful and I will catch you in my next
