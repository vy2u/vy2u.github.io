video is gonna be the 10 amazing
alternative and standard gifts that you
can get a girl for Valentine's Day
and I did this for Christmas gifts and I
thought to myself that they're gonna be
a lot of guys out there who have no idea
what to get a girl their existing
girlfriend or gah they want to make
their girlfriend or something for
Valentine's Day and a lot of girls out
there want guys to have a clue as to
what we want now a funny thing about us
girls is it's a case of it's not what
you said it's how you said it and the
st. Valentine's Day guess it's almost
like it's not what you give it's like
did you think about it you know oh
that's nice or did you just pick it up
from the local train station like on
your way back from work you bought her a
box of flowers and chocolates no that
doesn't worry anymore
guys you need to be thinking about this
so hopefully this will give you guys
some alternative ideas in good
preparation for Valentine's Day as to
what to get the girl okay so let's start
off with the material things for the
guys who want to get their Valentine's
something they can wrap up and just give
them as a present those of you who don't
necessarily want to do some of the
alternative things can do this if she is
into fashion and beauty so the first
thing I would definitely say would be
makeup brushes for girls like me who
like ivory non brushes are essential
part of our daily routine and kit and
the thing is if you buy them
individually it takes a while to build
up a kit collection
and can be very very expensive so really
we love it and guys get us the makeup
brushes for those of you who don't know
what to get Sigma I have an amazing
professional vortex collection
then I have it I can vouch for it it's
super soft super cool and super
inexpensive for what you're getting so
they do say diamonds are a girl's best
friends but not all of you are gonna go
out there buying diamonds right however
jewelry is always lovely lovely lovely
we love to receive jewelry and luckily
enough there's lots of not fake gold
fake jewelry out there or forgery or
faux jewelry whatever they call it that
we love we love statement necklaces and
I think statement necklaces are gonna be
amazing for this year especially with
the whole androgynous style so a chunky
necklace she will think oh my gosh you
thought about me when you and percent
heard that you can either go for
something designer something of the more
expensive scale or you can go for
something that's still a statement but
you know inexpensive I found this lovely
piece from H&amp;amp;M and it costed me $8.99 so
yeah that's jewelry so you could also go
for a designer bag now the reason I say
designer bag which is not for everyone
not everyone wants to buy a designer bag
but we see these as investment pieces
guys may not see the reason that we like
these but they are investment pieces
because they will one day they will reap
the reward and we get to wear them all
the time and I have a really cool bag
I've got a brother bag which I love like
any girl would love to receive a
designer bag if you don't want to go
like Prada Chanel right now Moschino
have got some really nice bags that I've
seen recently are like oh my gosh I'd
get that mishima bag and and there are a
bit cheaper on the scale of designer
bags so if you've got the money go
designer a fashion trendy item that you
could get her would be a boyfriend
blazer jacket I love these jackets but
I've seen these jackets I love them
they're structured this straight they've
got lapels then and she's into fashion
she loved one of these and especially
cause it's quite quite
and February is quite cold February
March April if you're from the UK it's
still very cold so one of these jackets
will keep her warm at night you can also
go for the bath products and the beauty
products and all that kind of stuff and
lush always have amazing Valentine's
gift sets and products and bath bombs
and pink stuff and pretty stuff and
candles that really make our hearts melt
so let's move on to the stuff that's a
little different a little bit
alternative and really show that you
have made an effort or you've really
thought about it now number one on my
list is if you want to impress a girl if
you're a guy and you want to be like
yeah I want to show her and there yeah
that was awful wasn't it but a hot air
balloon ride okay I saw this in the
Metro and it was like thirty percent off
a balloon voyage you're not even a blue
ride voyage take your girlfriend or the
guy you've run impress on a voyage and
this is like it's 99 pounds so just
about 100 pounds to take her out and
there's champagne on landing she will
definitely be impressed when you unwrap
her blindfolds and show her hot air
below so if you want to come across as
being cultured and very artsy definitely
an eye out on the West End would be
amazing take her for dinner and go and
see a show I really want to see Cirque
de Soleil
and I think most girls would love to
watch this or anyone would love to watch
it and hopefully this is what I get to
see I love Sector Soleil or just seeing
the pictures and everything it just
looks like colors and brightness and
gorgeousness so yes this is if you want
to come across as culture and just do
something a bit don't if you're a guy
who's not that cringe-worthy you're not
the romantic or you just want to be
alternative you just live like different
an anti Valentine's Day you can take
your Valentine to the London dungeon yes
and I I thought this my sister was like
what the heck but I thought to myself if
a guy you know took me to the London
dungeons I think she's so daring if you
wanna come across that way do that but
make sure she's not like scared of blood
and like weird stuff and she's not
scared easily because it could end in
tears and you will not be taking your
Valentine's home that evening so another
thing that goes definitely love and it
really shows that you've made an effort
on mixtapes mix tapes I know some girls
will melt if a guy makes them and mix
him I had a friend who a guy made her a
mixtape she's like oh my god playing me
this like so long a lot songs and I'm
like I don't care I have no formal
sentiment to your love songs but it
really really does make a difference and
it really shows that you thought about
her in it I definitely have a
recommendation of a mixtape which is by
daily and it's just amazing his voice
will melt any girl's heart and finally I
think a night out dancing okay and my
tap dancing together is amazing you know
it shown him show her you know seducer
it show her that you know how to me and
break it down on the dance floor now I'm
not saying go bumping and grinding at a
rave there are some amazing styles of
cards I believe there's one in Hobart
and I've been to it's like a Brazilian
Club it is amazing and it's almost like
Cannavale every every Saturday night and
they've got dancers who coming that
outfit it's gorgeous there's finger food
and everything I would love to go there
with my fiance and just you know dance
the night away
that's what Valentine's is all about
love and just enjoying people's company
so guys I hope you enjoyed that videos
and girls if you agree with me you know
like look let the system know and guys I
hope that you share this with your
friends and understand it's not what you
said it's the way you said it and for
Valentine's it's not what you buy but
it's the way you present it basically
just make it out like you put an effort
in even if you haven't
but guys back to watching and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
