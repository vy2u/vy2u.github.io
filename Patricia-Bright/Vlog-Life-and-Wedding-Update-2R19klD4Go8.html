a quick update I've really not spoken to
you guys properly for a really long time
and just like Patricia talking and I
stuff like that so I thought let me just
do this there's I know there's plenty
that you guys want to know about I will
get to it then fast forward no don't do
that please
okay so just in general Oh loads loads
of stuff loads of stuff always happens
obviously if I don't have a conversation
with someone for like four months
lots and lots that's happened I've had
loads more subscribers thank you guys
for coming and I want to do one of those
questions and aren't circles again so if
you guys haven't like you don't know
much about me and there's any questions
you want to ask me go ahead and leave
those questions below I'm gonna do a
video where I address all of these
questions at some point really really
soon yeah like life's no has its ups and
downs you know how it is
there's been a lot of changes I'm not
going to talk about all of them yet
until alike but we'll see what happens
in the future you know and oh I just
want to like clear the air and stuff
because it seems that sometimes my
videos are being taken in all some of
the things that I say are being taken in
the wrong way by people and you know I
just wanna apologize no I don't
apologize that you I'm not doing
anything wrong but and I just want to
say that any time I do a video or any of
those like really sarcastic statements
I'm a they're not directed at any
individual it could be directed at a
stereotype if you fit the stereotype
then so it you'll probably be offended
by what I say but truly I don't know it
anything I say anybody I'm not that kind
of person and I hope you guys like my
true followers and subscribers you know
that I don't I don't mean any harm it's
just my form of like humor and also I'm
not on Twitter or on blackberry and then
just about on Facebook so I'm not the
kind of person who goes around on the
internet making statements so if you
know like I can't defend myself if there
are any times that statements are being
made about me or towards me but like my
advice people is don't do that no don't
don't no jacket I really won't but um
yeah just
like for me I'm really good not really
growing but I'm you know quite mature
and I'd really don't have time for
tweeting statements regarding other
people and I wouldn't want people to do
that um about me either
so it's really clear that I in no way do
I mean anything towards anybody I'm
feeling a bit it's good like it's
getting really cold now and my house I
live in a really big house and it's like
it's never one I don't get it doesn't
make any sense it's like it's just
breezy every time you walk into a room
it's like breathe everywhere over here
it's only October that's it really the
garden is looking gorgeous too and have
a look at it yeah yeah let's show you
the garden this is what the gardens
looking like right now it's lovely
lovely lovely this I think October is
the best time for my garden and I do a
lot I do a lot of filming in there and I
said I don't I'm scared of foxes there's
there's quite a few foxes I won't even
lie so I just kind of stay in the top
part of the garden don't go down the
other end
but that's right and um you don't need
to see that first and wise you know I'm
switching it up I think I'm trying to be
a bit more grown-up and stuff like that
and maybe gone are the days that I can
wear cutoff shorts and ripped t-shirts
that stuff probably won't and it's
really hard for me because a guy in the
industry that I work in like I don't
what you see more on YouTube like is not
what I look like at work no way like I
am very professional like I wear a suit
and like it's very like very like
structure and stuff I just about can
wear like a coloured bangle or something
and they probably don't really enjoy it
but yeah I do want to just a bit more
mature I've been looking at some amazing
blogs amazing books recently and I'm
like ah like I now must be late but I
really like the blonde salad look at the
kind of swedishness it's so amazing oh
my god and then
okay I'm blabbing about all this stuff
buns in general ice-cold life's always
good God is always good to me so yeah I
have no complaints and I'm not somebody
I don't matter mom I don't like to
complain no matter what's going on in my
life because it will always work out
good for me personally oh and I know
that and I really believe that
so wedding update I know you guys want
to hear about this we get it a married
five months getting very fact looks good
and very yeah and get married in five
months shock horror I've got a date and
everything ready I have a venue so like
okay let's a ring that's a really lock
well I'll tell you what it's been like
from he recently well not recently
previously I was literally bridezilla I
was like crying all the time so I
couldn't find a venue and my guests are
like 350 like my guests are now 250
guests um
because I couldn't find a venue to see
all those people like I had a quote of
you know call this beautiful venue
bottlee mansion it's exactly what I want
too it's like my ideal wedding venue you
can google it and stuff and you know
pull them up and they were like oh no
how many guests um I was like all 250 or
350 and then she's no that was 250 right
she said to her I said okay let me just
tell you that up that'll be 48 thousand
pounds for those of you who don't know
how to use Google converter that is
about sixty eight thousand dollars maybe
more than that $70,000 I don't have
seventy thousand dollars to spend on a
wedding so it was really hard and I was
getting well I was getting quite higher
quotes which is fair enough not like
forty eight thousand pounds was the
highest quote I ever heard I thought you
guys are insane but um like I was going
to quite a few hotels and I hate hotel
venues anyway I wanted like a country
mansion that's what I wanted for my
wedding and you know it was just not
nice and you don't even get exclusive
use of the proper the venue
what is this and so no I mean it's got
money and my kaya Roni was a lot of
money yeah so but I found a lovely venue
and I'll show it to you
actually I'll show to you that that's
the venue I don't need to know where it
is so don't when you look just turning
up on my wedding day you know so that's
it from the front I'll show you all the
details as well but before I found this
for you I was so stressed out I was
crying all the time I like you know
helping me more like Maureen's maid of
honor huh yeah but where was your venue
hunt going on
where was your venue hunting and I know
I'm difficult so maybe that was an issue
Michael my god let's just we love him
but we just go sit down go sit down baby
go sit on the bench because some of the
venues that he suggested I was like are
you well I think he would have literally
just done it in like a local church hall
that's already with that but it's before
the camera stops but that's not me my
beautiful I'll give you some close-ups
as well this is the hole where we'll
cross the room that we get married in it
is beautiful there's a lake there's
peacocks that live on the ground they're
like white peacocks though let's go cute
like the grounds are gorgeous and
everything and it's got private gates
nice and I'll get to stay that the whole
venue is mine for the day private no one
else there beautiful grounds beautiful
drive up it's like you're going to the
South of France it is gorgeous
it's absolutely gorgeous and I think for
me that I want this is the thing the
vision I had when makeup made that
people will come and it's like a retreat
for them they can come that can enjoy
they can walk around that can eat just
like breathing like really nice country
air get out of this city because all of
us are our city city lovers and stuff
and it's like have a bit of countryside
you know and I love that like
authenticity of
of country houses and stuff like that so
that's my venue I'll show it to you to
yourself as well so that is the venue
from the front don't know I'm doing
I hope the lights not too bright on it
that's gorgeous
and this is the ceremony room it's all
marble flooring and just everything is
gorgeous it's got gold leaf everywhere
just all that gold leaf is like so
fabulous and look at the happy bride and
groom that could be me I look better
than that though and that's the
everybody have been on the grounds like
if only I don't know one day you can't
see it or but you can get an idea
basically okay so really I'm really
excited about the whole thing I've even
got like the wedding book now no you're
gonna see it inside it says well mine
doesn't even say wedding book it says
wedding planning Mike and butchy which
is my own Nigerian name and we just
refer to me as Butchie but the thing is
I'm like a you know don't know me that
well I'm like a really boring person I'm
like Excel spreadsheets
I've got spreadsheets for days like
they've got formulas in their deck
calculating profit lost revenue and
extras like I've got our budget is on
point and another thing we're still
thinking about is like honeymoon
destinations and I'm gonna toss up
between the Caribbean because everyone
goes to the Caribbean you all see those
sandals adverts like I've had the time
of my life
you know you see those adverts you're
like oh my god I want to go there
wherever it is but then I'm like I could
go to like Asia but I've already been to
Asia but I don't know or South America
South America is a real big option and
then Africa's been an option but
recently it's been quite dangerous in
both South America and Africa so it's
like where'd you go any suggestion there
amazing honeymoon
tenacious i love and i'm just still
having a few issues with right I don't
have a photographer yeah and I'm not
gonna spend a thousand two thousand
pounds on a photographer so if anyone
got some wedding photography ability you
not want to hook me up hook up
I do have caterers I do have staff so
we're gonna have all lovely waiters like
dressed up in maybe I'll put them in
traditional ware or something I don't
know haven't decided yet we've got our
waiters and stuff what don't we have
what else don't we have what we haven't
picked out a place if anyone knows what
that means we haven't picked I like
color-coordinated fabrics yeah so I'm
gonna do that in the next few weeks I
don't have a wedding dress yet no
wedding dress but there's loads and
loads to do but I'm really really
excited about the whole thing in it it's
it's an experience really and it's five
months but the main thing that I'm
really excited about is we've now
started our um we're having premarital
counseling and I think anybody who you
know what to get married by bla bla I
need to go for counseling okay you need
to prepare yourself a bit a wife and a
husband obviously and our pastors
literally are specialists in marriage
and they really are called to cook so
yeah we've started Meritor cancelling
and like preparation and everything and
it's really given us great insight more
insight into each other we know most of
this stuff but like what it's actually
like and getting advice from wise
counsel makes big difference in in the
lives of the young and I really am glad
that I kind of found these people to do
well not found then God found them for
us and we want to build our marriage on
like the strongest foundation you could
ever build it on cuz after the wedding
and all that jazz you got a live
together you know I got a look at his
smelly sucks
no his smoke stops nice well he's
actually very very neat so ya went in
preparation and building that strong
foundation is amazing right now we went
to like our first session oh we both
left like oh my god it was such nerds
anywho that is my update as it
there's been ages hits like we lost
tolls okay if you want to ask me any
other questions leave a comment below
