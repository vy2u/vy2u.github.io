me video just to give you a quick idea
of what I'm like in the mornings and I'm
getting ready to go out become queen of
snooze I can get you turn my phone off
with my eyes closed but I kind of set
earth snooze probably about four times
and then I finally arrive I always make
my bed when I wake up cuz it's just a
lot easier and I've always put slippers
on because my house is so cold in the
morning I always listen to something
uplifting in the morning because I love
music that starts me off in the right
way of course I go to the bathroom brush
my teeth have a shower to freshen up for
the day so after I shower
obviously I moisturize I use be 45 as
I've suffered from eczema in the past
and I find it to be quite moisturizing
areas use an eye cream as recently I
kind of started getting quite dry skin
around my eyes I think it's the hard
water where I live
on my face I use a product that has
glycolic acid in it as it's a great way
to keep skin smooth and clear and that
always top up with a sunscreen this is
from water your skin calm and it's
probably the best sunscreen I've found
as it's really not very greasy and if
you've ever had crack lips
nipple balm is the best solution
honestly I do my clothes hunt in the
morning I wish it was this easy as in
pulling an outfit here and there but it
probably isn't but I do finally find
something and of course I scope myself
out in the mirror and see what I think
of my outfit
I don't usually have time to mess about
with makeup in the morning I keep it all
in the same place in easy reach and I'm
more or less put the same makeup on
every day
so I keep my hair products in my
electric case on the opposite side of
the room but honestly I don't do much to
my hair in the morning it's literally
just a quick brush and if a few cars
have dropped I will just put those back
in
I've gotten a little accessories corner
and I'll pick a few things to put on if
I feel like it that day I'd also go to
my easy access rail and pick a jacket
for the day I'll pick and my shoes for
the day for my shoe cupboard and a bag
which is my JustFab pick for April I
never eat breakfast I just grab some
fruit and that's me ready to go for the
day so guys let me know if you liked
that video I know it's a bit different
for me but I'm trying new stuff and if
you want more great really with me video
then leave a comment below and leave a
thumbs up
these days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
