video is going to be a little bit
different and what I'm gonna do is show
you wardrobe essentials this is
something I get asked about all the time
so I thought okay let me show you what I
think in my opinion are the basics that
you need to kind of just build and
develop wardrobe and then on top of
these basics you can go ahead and build
in your colors or stars and just
customize it to yourself so let's get
started so the first item I think you're
going to need are your denim or sew or
something for your bottom because the
denim I think you need a black pair
plain black pair there's kind of
standard washed denim and also a dark
indigo denim okay and you don't
necessarily need an indigo dinner if you
have the two so maybe these two are more
or less the essential kind of denims
that you you probably need a pair of
high-waisted jeans as well because they
look quite fashionable and make an
outfit look dressed up especially with a
pair of heels and as I always say jeans
should always be skinny
so the next thing you're gonna need are
going to be your trousers okay or as you
guys in America say your pants and I
think that you need a pair and black I
don't think you need pair in a color or
the color that suits you so what you
like so me I love tans Browns and camels
and my accent colors are always going to
be those colors or even beiges and stuff
like that so you know you get your black
pants and these can have pockets on them
if you want them to
there could be high-waisted so these are
a pair of high-waisted Jewish rich pants
from H&amp;amp;M which are more or less ones
that I kind of like and what we need to
really smart pants I like them to be a
bit slouchy but very fitted on the waist
and also here another pair of pants I
had I love them because they've got the
pleat on the front that makes any pair
of pants or trousers look really really
smart these are high waisted and these
are vintage pair so I got four pound and
they're gorgeous gorgeous on and also
pants you can also go for a nice skinny
leg it's sticking with the bottom half
you're gonna need a pair of leggings
okay and if you are gonna get leggings
try and get a kind of a thick pair not
really thin flimsy
prymaat leggings go on invest in some 20
quid thicker leggings this is the pair I
had but these are really thick and they
actually have suede on the inside if you
can see that I hope you can see that and
they've got pockets as well but these
are leggings because you can throw this
on with anything
so sticking with the bottom half you're
gonna need your shorts as well okay so I
think you need a pair of denim shorts
preferentially high-waisted that's my
opinion
but if you need your denim shorts you
need your black shorts these are a
vintage pair of culottes black shorts
but it still counts
and also I think you need once again an
accent color pair so these are a car key
pair of shorts these look great on
holiday and differently a nice my not
all high-waisted and that's I think
about just got have a thing about
high-waisted and things to a bottom up
skirt I only think you need two kinds of
skirts a nice fitted back skirt and then
you know a patterns girl you know
they're not movement or stuff like that
so I've got a quick example my two
skirts so my standard black skirt fitted
let's go quite sure I like short skirts
and then my nice they could Aurora Oscar
that's from Bershka polka dot so
something that's got a bit of color and
a bit of flair as well
okay so the next item I'm going to go
onto is the white shirt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
