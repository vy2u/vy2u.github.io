video is going to be a little bit
different and what I'm gonna do is show
you wardrobe essentials this is
something I get arcs about all the time
so I thought okay let me show you what I
think in my opinion are the basics that
you need to kind of just build and
develop a wardrobe and then on top of
these basics you can go ahead and build
in your colors or stars and just
customize it to yourself so let's get
started so the first item I think you're
going to need are your denim or so or
something for your bottom because the
denim I think you need a black pair
plain black pair this kind of standard
wash denim and also a dark indigo denim
okay and you don't necessarily need an
indigo dinner if you have the two so
maybe these two are more or less the
essential kind of dylan's that you you
probably need a pair of high-waisted
jeans as well because they look quite
fashionable and make an outfit look
dressed up especially with a pair of
hills and as I always say jeans should
always be skinny
so the next thing you're going to need
are going to be your trousers okay or
add um you guys in America say your
pants and I think that you need a pair
in black and I think you need a pair in
a color or color that suits you so what
you like so me I love tans Browns and
camels and my accent colors are always
going to be those colors or even beiges
and stuff like that so you know you get
your black pants and these can have
pockets on them if you want them to they
can be high waisted so these are a pair
of high-waisted and drawers stretch
pants from H&amp;amp;M which are more or less
ones that I kind of like i'm not willing
to really smart pants i like them to be
a bit slouchy but very fitted on the
waist and also hear another pair of
pants i had i love them because they've
got the plate on the front that makes
any pair of pants or trousers look
really really smart these are high
waisted and these are a vintage pair I
got four pound and then gorgeous
gorgeous on and also pants you can also
go for a nice skinny leg it's sticking
with the bottom half you're gonna need a
pair of leggings okay and if you are
going to get leggings try and get a kind
of a thick pair not really thin flimsy
prymaat leggings going to invest in some
20 quid thicker leggings and this is the
pair i had but these are really thick
and they actually have swayed on the
inside if you can see that hope you can
see that and they've got pockets as well
but these are leggings because you can
throw this on with anything
so sticking with the bottom half you're
gonna need your shorts as well okay so I
think you need a pair of denim shorts
preferentially high-waisted that's my
opinion but if you need your denim
shorts you need your black short these
are a vintage pair of culotte black
shorts but it still counts and also I
think you need once again an accent
color pair so these are a car key pair
of shorts these look great on holiday
and differently a nice my not all
high-waisted and that's I think I just
got have a thing about high-waisted and
things to the bottom up skirt and I only
think you need two kinds of skirts a
nice fitted back skirt and then you know
a patterns girl you know the lot of
movement or stuff like that so I've got
a quick example my two skirts so my
standard black skirt fitted let's go
quite sure I like short skirts and then
my nice they call it Aurora Oscar that's
from birch car polka dot so something
that's got a bit of color and a bit of
flair as well
ok so the next item i'm going to go onto
is the white shirt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
