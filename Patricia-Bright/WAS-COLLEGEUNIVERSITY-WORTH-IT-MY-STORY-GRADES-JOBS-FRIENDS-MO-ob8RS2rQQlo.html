know you're probably looking and
thinking of where the world is Patricia
I am currently in the amazing city of
Istanbul I'll probably be home now but
I've been on an amazing press trip with
Harrods but I'll tell you guys all about
it we'll check out my snapchat I'll be
on my blog but I know that I've been
wanting to do this video for a really
long time and it's about my college and
university story and kind of at the
start of my career story and some of the
learnings that I've had along the way
and I feel like this story's been really
important for me to tell because so many
people asked me about it and so many of
you guys are a bit younger or you're in
university or you're planning to go to
university and so I'm going to use it
University and college interchangeably
interchangeably because half of my
viewers are from the US just to mess
that up but you know I'm British so I'm
not going to say that so when I say
College people anyway so I wanted to
share this story just to give you guys
you know just my experience what I did
and I will hopefully progress to share
with you my career story as well so I
worked in industry but I'll get to that
and then hopefully I should be
interviewing some amazing people to
share with you their story in their
journeys as well so guys that cop the
ball you might need notepad I haven't
written notes or anything beforehand so
I'm just kind of thinking off the top of
my head and I'm actually waiting for
room service I'm hoping they don't come
like in the middle of this filming
number one so prior to going to
university I actually studied biology
chemistry psychology and Business
Studies so I was a science girl before
and I had gone to university and I loved
the sciences I absolutely loved science
but I found chemistry quite hard and so
I ended up dropping that and I felt like
University was a time for me to you know
do whatever I wanted to do and so I
decided to pick international fashion
marketing to be my course because I was
like I love fashion and so without much
thinking without much planning to bernis
I didn't have that much insight prior to
go into university all I knew is that I
could be successful in whatever
I wanted to do and I've always believed
that and I thought that K if I do a
fashion course it means that I get to
break away from these boring courses
that I didn't want to see I couldn't see
myself as a career doing I couldn't see
myself in a lab I couldn't see myself as
a lawyer but I had a passion for fashion
that sounds really cool corny so went to
university and you know got on the
course and worked I actually hated I
hated my first unit year of the
University and I was very very depressed
I cried so much my mom and my sister
came to stay with me for the first two
weeks because I just didn't want to be
there I didn't want to be alone and I
didn't know anyone in the city I went to
besides one guy who I wasn't that tight
with in college but he really did take
me under his wing and we became really
good friends at university but I didn't
enjoy my course I barely went to
lectures and because it was actually
more of a business he fashion course and
I thought it was going to be more of a
fashion course to be honest I didn't
even have any expectations which has
probably lacked my lack of research so I
would always suggest do your research
and what is your expectation and then
the more I was in the course the more I
found out what people and what was the
long-term trajectory for people who had
done the fashion course and like that
you know it was you're an assistant or
you work to address or you work to all
these different places
and it's like fifteen thousand pounds a
year and the one thing I knew is I
didn't want to be broke and I knew that
I didn't want to be that starving girl
you know did the fact I didn't want that
I wanted to have money I wanted to have
a steady job and I wanted to earn so in
on my course we had an accounting module
and for some reason I was excellent at
accounting but I got very good grades in
that module that was my out on my
fashion course that was my best module
was the accounting and finance module so
then I was like accountants make money
could I be an accountant could I work at
different companies and be an accountant
for a fashion company yes I could so
then I decided I'm changing my course
because I couldn't see the long-term
financial potential of working in
fashion and I realized I didn't even
enjoy it that much as well
I liked clothes I don't
she care that much about fashion like I
went to museums and stuff about the
history of fashion I was like yawn
whatever I like I'm of money and I'm a
numbers person and so I did the
accounting course so then I moved on to
do my accounting course learn the world
who didn't like the cause and who didn't
want a beat want to be an accountant
Patricia and so I realized that the
problem was probably maybe me where I
didn't like my courses maybe my attitude
towards it and the way I perceive the
future but I stayed on the course and I
did very well I got a 2:1 and I
graduated and again the key things that
I found was that loneliness was a really
big issue for me on my course I didn't
talk to people on my course and that
really hindered me when it came to exam
time or having to have those
conversations and needing help I had no
one to talk to
so she in the first two years and I
remember the first guy who spoke to me
was a guy who tapped on my shoulder when
I fell asleep in a lecture and then he
became my friend but then in my last
year I made really good friends like a
dealer and Jeremy they became a really
good friends and like that they became
my study group but I found that the
accounting course was something that I
wanted to do because I thought that I'd
make longer term earnings it was much
more of a professional job and my
parents would be happier as an African
child
your arriving accountant a lawyer a
doctor pharmacist or something like that
some really boring generic job so that
they can tell their friends and family
and I'm sure this isn't other cultures
and you know what I did international
fashion marketing my family dropped
fashion they're like marketing she was
in marketing when I was like a
counseling they're like oh she's a
accountant like they love love love that
for me I feel like the accounting course
was a good cause and I feel like I
learned a lot but I feel like nothing
prepares you like when you just actually
stopped working but but regarding my
social life in university actually it
was really good so I was the president
of the afro-caribbean Society for one or
so years I had a really good social
group had a group of girls who well the
in the first year I had like a really
big social group girls who looked off
me I hated living in my halls of
residence I hated living alone no two
girls who basically let me squat in
their their rooms for the whole of the
year like I would live with one girl we
would share a single bed then I'd you
know when she got tired of me I go to
the other guards room which has single
bed for like months at a time and I
would just live between both of their
rooms and that was what I did for the
whole year because I was very very
lonely where I was based and they were
really supportive they were like sisters
to me then the second year things got
quite messy for me from a friendship
perspective and I ended up being very
very alone so a lot of the people I was
close to didn't really talk to me that
much we can kind of had a falling out
but I can't really pinpoint it to
anything it's like we distance ourselves
and then it seemed that the girls all
were friends and I was left out of the
group and I remember being very very
down
I used to cries so much about it because
they just all like left me and actually
one of the girls that lived in the house
and then the other girls would come and
pick up her and then all go out together
and I'd just be sitting there like noni
local of a tear rolling down my eye like
lonely pet and and so what at that point
in time my sister was at university and
my sisters Apple is / was a party animal
and her and her friend would come up and
party and stay with me and so that
really made my life better and obviously
I met Michael who then became you know
my boyfriend and he was such a strong
support at me at the time when I felt so
alone and then also my course I didn't
know anyone either so those were also
quite difficult times where they felt
right after you know the second year
that which was my heart is it got a lot
better for me you know I ran the ACS I
had a social group and I felt like more
confident and I met made other friends
and newer friends which is always really
really good and a really important thing
to do so realistically after University
I had no clue what I actually wanted to
do
however I'm the kind of person I asked
him round did I get advice from people
and so the guy who I came to who I knew
from my college days he was telling me
about a guy on his course who got a job
at Barclays bank he was on 35,000 pounds
a year that he was interviewing at
Merrill Lynch and I should make sure I
do an application to them and he intro'd
me to let the recruitment team from
Merrill Lynch and so then and there I
just heard dollar signs I by dollar
signs dollar don'ting ming-ming ding
dollars Apple you know University
graduate who was on 41 grand a year I
was like I'm ready for them yes and so
you know that's what I ended up doing so
I really focused on getting the grades
that I needed doing that extra work and
all that stuff to get that job but I'll
talk about the job later so for those of
you who are at university bits of advice
that I have for you number one your
course is not going to be what you end
up doing University is a is a place
where you learn how to become
independent where you learn to research
where you learn to educate yourself
because you can't rely on somebody to
tell you you have to start doing that
research yourself it also teaches you to
be comprehensive and to be analytical
and critical and I think that those are
some of the skill sets that you take
into the career so the University course
you might do might not necessarily be
the exact thing you're going to do as a
job or relate at all but the skill sets
you you pick heart is really really good
number two your university degree alone
is not going to be good enough you need
to be looking at what else are you doing
because we're living in an age where
there's loads of people with lots of
different experience what are you doing
outside of your course so I was
president of the ACS I mentored children
I was second place in the Young
Enterprise Business Scheme where we
created a business to sell locally and
we won some funding to do it so you have
to do stuff that and I also worked so I
worked a lot for out universe
tea and I also ran my own hair
extensions company I used to walk
company I said my own client and I would
let do people's hair and I would sell
weaves as well I would do all kinds of
things and I'll put that on my CV like I
have my own hair hair company I'll write
that on my CV standing the young
enterprise I had there I had mentoring
children on my CV it's not just the
degree alone that's going to take you
there so it's important to build your
skillset outside of your course number
three friendships will come and go and
they will definitely change you might
meet people at university who you feel
like they're your Cody's for life and
then you you completely like you know
dissipate and don't see each other or
they end up being your long-term partner
and you know eight years and eight I'm
still with my my husband who I met while
I was at university but you have to
realise that the friendships coming and
going are a part of the cycle and people
come into your life for a season for a
reason and for something else I can't
remember the sentence and so they'll
come into your life and based on
different things so you have to try not
allow the friendships and the problems
with the friendship to impact what
you're doing on your course make sure
you seek help when you need it you know
what iron sharpens iron and I realized
that I wish I had known say a dealer and
Jeremy these two people that I knew in
my last year I wish I knew them in my
first year because I would have been
better then because we would ask each
other questions would have study groups
would push each other and I was like man
I just wish I knew these guys then
because I would have done better in my
first year and a sad really really
really sad story because I didn't really
speak to anyone on my course I actually
missed an exam I came at the end of the
exam rather than the beginning of the
exam for some reason I read the exam
sheet wrong and I saw the end time and
not the beginning time missed that exam
that was my best exam had to resit the
exam I got 82% in my recent exam but
guess what happens it gets capped at 40%
because it was a reset that was in my
second year and I was so upset that I
couldn't believe that something as silly
as that happened but something like that
wouldn't have happened
if I had a network or group of people to
talk to
University might not be for everybody
and I know lots of people are trying to
debate whether or not to go whether or
not to go because of the cost don't
worry about the cost life is very very
long you don't pay back that month that
much money and if you don't make any
money you have to pay it back right I
honestly don't worry about a long-term
investment in your long term life it's
not for everyone but don't let the cost
stop and if the thing it's not just
about the course it's about what you
learn and it's about what you pick up
and it's about who me and how they
impact your life but if you don't see
that as being a benefit benefit to you
then that's something you're going to
question yourself on but I'm going to be
honest with you I do see a big
difference a huge difference between the
people who do go to university and the
people who don't go to university and
it's probably because they haven't had
that experience unless they've got years
of work experience so years of work
experience can combat just university
experience but just thinking because
you've got going to university means
that you're going to make it does not
mean that you need to get some
experience behind you and to support you
finally enjoy it while it lasts because
life is real I know lots of you guys
that in a rush to go off you're going to
be working for the next 50 years so
three years or four years studying is
really just an experience that you'll
get to have and that's what I think I
don't think it's a waste of time but I
know there are people who say is I don't
think it's a waste of time I'm very glad
I went I would definitely go again
there's times I wish I was still at
university and it's times I think you
know what I could go back because
learning in that way you'll never get to
learn like that again where you can sit
down and focus on just being able to
learn because life is so guns blazing
you can't just sit back and just read a
book about something and write it down
and take in that thought process you
don't really get that opportunity in
your everyday life so savor it enjoy it
and party hard I won't lie to you I
partied two to three times a week I have
the stamina of an ox you'll fight me on
the
for 3 a.m. 4 a.m. 5 a.m. but I was never
one of those girls who went out without
a coat I used to see girls in Manchester
with short skirts and and single it oh
so we're getting strap and no coat the
cloakroom is only 1 pound it's not worth
dying of hypothermia please let's not do
that let us wear jacket ok it's not
every day freezing your butt off to look
nice that is my University and College
experience and some of the advice that
I'd like to give to some of you guys who
might be going but I really hope you
enjoy that and you found it useful so
