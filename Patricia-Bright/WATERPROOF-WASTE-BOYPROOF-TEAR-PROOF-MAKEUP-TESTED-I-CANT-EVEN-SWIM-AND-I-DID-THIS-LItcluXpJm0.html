not to you I lit like a little boy the
tears you cry that's it no beautiful
people welcome to my channel I hope you
are doing well today I'm coming to you
giving you some I think of vibes
what do you guys think do you like it I
feel a little bit different but I'm
enjoying some sun sea and sand so I was
like you know I need to do something a
little bit different but you know what
I've got you guys I know Valentine's is
coming so I wanted to try some water
food and water resistant makeup to keep
you protected protected from the guys
who might want to give you tears might
want to get you hot and sweaty or you
know you still want to look good if
you've been left in the lurch crying in
the rain like I wasn't left cuz know
what every day at me but you know what I
mean
I've got a pool and the Sun and the sea
in front of me so we're gonna we're
gonna test that out we're gonna see am I
gonna stay as strong as cement and just
be perfect or am I gonna melt like a
soggy chocolate bar on a hot day or a
chocolate bar that's been in your
waistbands back pocket that he attempted
to give you for Valentine's Day
really and the free rose that he stole
from someone's garden anyway we're gonna
test that out okay so I'm gonna fill out
my brows now and I'm going to use the
goof proof ball pencil phone with
Benefit Cosmetics I use this one all the
time and it is definitely it stays in
place I think it'll be good in the water
you know the worst thing you want is you
know you're leaning on your man you're
getting comfortable and half of your
eyebrow disappears on his shirt
no honey stay in place don't expose me
okay I'm gonna set that in place with
the gimme brow and that's just gonna
give me that extra you know hold next
I'm gonna go around my brows and I'm
gonna go in with the Dior forever this
is the undercover it's a new concealer
and it is a waterproof I actually like
that
perfect eyebrow shades I really want to
set this in place my tears will not
embarrass me you know the water will not
effort my makeup so I'm gonna spray with
fixed-price before I put the rest of my
face on you know I think this might be a
secret to success okay next up and going
in with the all ours foundation from YSL
this foundation it doesn't say that it's
waterproof but it is kind of meant to be
like just damage proof it's meant to be
really long wearing the things they're
like the marketing with a 24 hour long
wearing or like 16 hours something
ridiculous and like it's meant a really
really hold in place so you know to me
that sounds good enough to be waterproof
this is shade B 80
oh give me some extra yellow I've got a
little bit of a tan you know I can get a
tan in like 6 seconds we're not really
matching like we should be but you know
what that's the power of blending so I
cannot wait to just test this out it
needs to stay in place I'm just thinking
of all the scenarios that might require
water so there's tears of joy tears of
sadness a jealous girlfriend a drink
over your face got no none of that okay
so next I'm going to go in with the
Urban Decay all nighter concealer you
guys have already probably seen my
review of this and yet it's good you
know I feel like it is it's almost like
a tea or a pillow so even if you're for
tear or what up sites but in life I feel
like we all need a tear repeller the one
thing I found with this though is that
you have to move quickly because it
dries so and quickly I'm not gonna lie
you could look like a patchy hot mess
with this if you're not careful do any
of you guys already have dates I'd love
to know any excited are you nervous
is it gonna be hot and sweaty or is it
gonna be a teary-eyed event I want to
know I'm also gonna go in with the
darker one to contour this is super dark
so I'm gonna be really light handed with
it I never had a Valentine's people and
never had
I was not used he was giving me about
the times I lit like a little boy and I
went to a girls school so yes so on
Valentine's Day
I basically cognate so Cicely I actually
like wrote myself my own Valentine's
card like okay girl you gotta love
yourself you know if someone doesn't
love you love yourself
add some stuff but I am gonna go in with
the novice palate this is so gorgeous
and also this I feel like these are the
perfect combo but yeah I feel like these
pallets they give me the shine and I
think is what if you're going on a date
or something or meeting new people or
something you should go with what you
feel the most comfortable in and for me
that's like moves and golds do you know
what we're gonna need to do I'm gonna
fix plus six blast the brush fix plus
the press so that the shine is very real
and stays in place because I'm gonna go
in with a little guitar
imagine if you could fix plus your life
that would be so good just put it all in
there and just get your life set you
guys know I don't really wear loads and
loads of eyeshadow but not for
valentines you should do the most but
you need to do the most about looking
that you're putting too much effort in
you don't look like you're thirsty even
though you might be you know
okay next I'm gonna go in with Bobby
Brown this is a long wear waterproof
eyeliner I don't know do people still
like wearing eyeliner I do sometimes I
feel like it really makes my eyes pop
okay so next I'm gonna go get in with
the bad gal bang at mascara from benefit
cosmetics this mascara is new the launch
has been a ridiculously epic around this
and I haven't tried it yet
and supposedly it is gravity defying
your lashes should be lifted from the
shadows darling your eyes should be open
to see if your man is real fake right in
front of you it isn't waterproof but
it's water-resistant and it's much proof
and come proof and should just have your
lashes looking you know kind of thick so
you know they've got NASA technology and
all sorts in this not Swanson or
anything but you know I read the press
release and I'm like okay let's go in
with this mascara specially because I
have curly lashes
do you like the brush though very light
wow that's really just done a lot to the
lashes and little goes a long way it
feels very light on though it actually
looks sick you guys know I have
literally non-existent struggle lashes
this is just giving me a little
something-something this is Brian I feel
like I don't even have to put on lashes
but do you know what C is I'm really
gonna test it out we're gonna put on
some lashes anyway I'm gonna go in with
my who the beauty and I'm gonna go in
this Samantha okay next up I'm gonna go
in with two these are lip paints they're
from Sephora love these they're not
waterproof but they don't move and I
feel like most lip paints don't move so
we're good with this I like to wear two
shades to give me you know extra
kissable ombre lip
okay obviously we're gonna set
everything in place I think any powder
will do I am still loving and using
regularly my map patrick star peridot
listen it's literally perfect so we're
just gonna set how they're realistically
is life-changing let's be real and I
feel like powders are what like
waterproof and make everything even more
fantastical you know okay and I'm also
gonna go in with my Wilder from glossier
I know that it was weird after I did
that video there's some products I just
generally ended up really liking from
glossier that have made their way into
my mainstream collection which is always
a good sign this just does it off just
gonna let that sit for a bit ladies okay
let's add back some clothes recently
I've been using the iconic London
illuminating drops they're actually six
while I've been here I've been using
this and it's given me one reflection
that is just Charlotte average Shannon I
mean Shannon this is the pinky of one I
don't know where my golden one is but
what I do is I use this as I tap it in
tap it on and then I go in this palette
here from NARS oh my gosh I just you
know stroke down the middle because it's
a little bit sexual with just choke down
for middle cross and then I just put
that on top and it gives me a rose
a ridiculous pop that's a ridiculous pop
notice like rude the pop is rude
the prop is rude ah okay I think that's
my makeup done but you know we've got to
finish it off with some fixed glass we
need to lock it all in so I spray all
the demons away like get out of my life
spray it all on kick your face unlock be
flawless no matter what happens on
Valentine's so guys that is my
waterproof waste matte proof joy proof
tear proof makeup look done it's not
time to test it

got you let's go test this out I think I
might have shown you my pool and my
views mister second if you haven't seen

cheap earrings because they will end up
going green I'm yeah Sun is shinin let's

last we've lost the lunch man down man

gonna cry man down

look kind of flawless you know it's not
that bad yeah my eyeshadows definitely
washed away but some washed away into
the distance do you know what the face
actually looks quite good and we've got
a little mascara leakage but I think
that that was after I like pulled off
the lashes and that the lashes getting
in my eye and I was like I think that's
what that is because the rest of my
eyelashes got really nice oh my gosh and
