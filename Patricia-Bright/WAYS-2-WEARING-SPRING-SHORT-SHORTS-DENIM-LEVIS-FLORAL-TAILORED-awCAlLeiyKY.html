video is going to be on spring shorts
and kind of short style basically I was
gonna do leather shorts so I thought
they're bit they're bit overdone and I'm
not really a fan of them but I'll just
show you some different shorts that I
have and kind of how I would wear them
and what I think would look quite nice
and it's just ways to wear shorts not
how to it okay guys I'll enjoy the video
so that's the first thing I'm going to
show you is the whole denim shorts look
I like the denim shorts they're really
really casual you can kind of wear them
anytime anywhere any place and
everyone's got these like I've got the
Levi's ones which literally these are
from urban offers but you can get them
in any vintage shop you know most on pay
for pedal cars is 15 pounds which
literally you could just find em and
just find this shape that suits you the
most I really do like the ones that are
kind of more high-waisted as well if you
can't find and whatever those of any
matter the way I wear them I always wear
them with tights cause any short side
where I always wear ties I don't write
showing like extreme amounts of leg
anyway so I'm kind of wearing it with
this casual cut off cut sleeve shirt
from Topshop and this is kind of how I
would like to just wear it as a standard
really really easy I'll show you how I
would dress it up for a night out cuz I
would wear these and
so guys here's how I would dress up the
shorts literally I love crop tops at the
moment not everyone likes crop tops I
don't want to show my belly button but I
just like to show a little bit they're
just a little bit
we don't want it all the way up here no
no black blaze are obviously just to
keep it kind of elegant
some nice ankle boots on which you guys
have seen and I'm going to keep wearing
at the time some jewelry and you know
and they're all cute really smart bags
so from something that looks really kind
of dirty and rough you can like that
make yourself look really elegant and
chic and very London no Fashion Week you
know darlings hi guys so this look is
floral or pattern shorts and these are
kind of a loose chiffon almost Kulak
type style shorts these are actually
hearts uh-huh you get the idea
I would wear they usually like a really
casual hippie top which I'm wearing so
where's everything from these are from
Primark from naxi a but there's you
always find these anywhere
okay floral shorts anyway the top is a
slab top from H&amp;amp;M buy no no Martha but
the Topshop and I would just wear these
women like nice pair of flat shoes these
are my top shop shoes that I've had for
ages like these are just my go-to
like floppy shoes so this is
a really casual outfit that I would just
wear okay guys so this look here is a
tailored shorts look so people usually
get these in black or navy but yeah I
decided to get them in peach and that
nice kind of loose shorts with pockets
and creases longing I would wear that
with mechanized solution I'm sure that
sure these are from Urban Outfitters as
well the shirt is from h-naught hm the
shirt is from new look and I love this
shirt look at this shirt it's like
see-through
we've got button inside okay look at the
cool it's looking a bit horse let's
let's just not go into doubt darlings so
yeah yeah so I would wear this you know
with something casual once again these
can be dressed up for my output blazer
on it and some high heels and you are
good to go so guys that is the end of my
shorts video I hope you liked it and I
would say if you want to see I've got
like spring skirts and stuff like that
so if you liked this video and it gets
enough like them all
