me for long enough and if I absolutely
love leather it can be faux leather it
can be rollerball I wear it a lot and it
doesn't just have to be a jacket it
could be worn in so many ways and I'm
going to show you how I love to wear it
so first things that it's the accessory
many of us wear leather type shoes and
bags and this is the easiest way to get
it into your wardrobe here I'm wearing a
coated leather bag which is functional
and I absolutely love it with like a
really simple outfit like this so if
you're not looking to go all out
leathery you can go for the trimming
like this skirt here which I bought from
Topshop years ago I just love the way
it's just got little details of leather
versus being all over
and I've just paired this with basically
my husband shot so next is a really
alternative way but this is wearing
leather on the top so I found this
really cool top which is from Urban
Outfitters and I just love the texture
the coating and how easy it looks in
casual as you can see I've just prepared
that with a pair of skinny jeans and a
tackle bag
the next is the all-time classic it's
got to be the leather jacket again I
have had this jacket for ages it's from
H&amp;amp;M and basically if you want to look
hard and you just want to dress anything
girly down and leather jacket is the way
to go
it always looks cool no matter how you
wear me
finally it's my absolute favorite which
is the nether bottom
I love limit rousers leather leggins
sucks or whatever you name it I wear it
on the bottom half and here's a pair of
high-waisted ones that I have from
Topshop but I've got a selection
basically so guys I hope you enjoyed
that video did you have a favorite look
from that lookbook and if you want to
see more you can find it on my blog
that's its moments of style calm and in
the meantime I will see you later and
I'm on Facebook and Twitter if you are
the friendly see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
