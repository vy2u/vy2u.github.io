just gonna call him angry camel oh I
think this is really keep on when I wear
something like out I mean business
darlings yes darling hello beautiful
people welcome to my channel I hope you
are doing well I feel like it has been a
hot minute since I actually sat down and
did a video I don't know why it's been
just over a week which actually isn't
that long but for me it kind of is and I
feel like I'm coming to you all
sophisticated I'm wearing a wat hem we
London darlings they've got a
two-for-one offer which I'll have in my
description box but I was feeling like I
had to be a little bit more elegant
nowadays because girls let me tell you
my last I spent a video got D monetized
by YouTube yes guys don't want me to
tell the truth they don't want me to say
a nipple to the wind they don't want me
to talk about penis belt you know they
don't want me to talk about any of that
guys and how does that excuse me I am
telling you guys the truth you know we
are all experiencing this will me go and
we try own clothing
I mean like one I think it's going to
look one way and why does it look
another way why are so things you know
visible when they shouldn't be
however it's okay guys we're gonna be
elegant and classy you know we're gonna
be a sophisticated Sally and we're not
gonna let that stop us so today guys I
have another video for you we got a
review and online brand and I decided I
want to switch up my reviews just a
little bit we're gonna take you out on
the road guys they're gonna wear the
outfits so guys today we're gonna review
the style is in a while or is it a wall
if you guys don't know about in the
style I don't quite know where you have
been I feel like in the style has popped
up out of nowhere in the last year and a
half it's all over my feet I see a lot
of celebrities wearing it I mean
celebrities say like reality TV stars
and so I was like listen you guys have
been you guys have been advertising to
me constantly so I was gonna spend
little bit of money and then went on to
the website and it was relatively easy
it worked really well what I said that I
thought that there was no rhyme or
reason to the Kovan it was just clothing
and also it just looked a little bit
just Instagram trendy like it's very
different to say like classic brands
they're very much like you know spring
is in so spring colors spring styles or
coats as in and they've all got the same
kind of coats coming through it was just
clothing and then also was organized by
different collaborations so I decided to
pick up a couple of pieces from some
collection so Tammy hem bro I picked up
I think at one or two pieces from Sarah
Ashcroft who I dunno and then I also
picked some other stuff from the new in
here comes the drama shipping and
delivery so because of the size of my
order I wanted to get free Next Day
Delivery you know I spent my coin I want
to receive my item so let's assume that
I made my order on like a Monday right
shoes they came that's that you know
what you excited you're waiting by the
door waiting for the postman there was
no delivery Wednesday no delivery
Thursday Friday Saturday came and I
still hadn't received my delivery I was
like what is going on where's my
delivery there was no email those no
anything there was no update and there
was no I know because there was a
tracking code so I could check my
tracking code and it had I think it said
that my my order had left the dispatch
and that was it my order dispatched
where did you dispatch to space I was
like where is this order so I am not
emailing customer service who actually
to be honest they did get back to me
quite quickly and they said to me your
order was lost where how where did you
lose my order to my order weren't
missing so how am i order went missing
where it went missing as long as my
money isn't missing
I don't really care and it's so annoying
because imagine if you're buying items I
was actually buying items to go on
holiday with and so they were like oh we
can give you back a refund or you can
reorder we can reorder the order for you
so I said okay Fran reorder my order for
me so reordered my order and it didn't
come the next day I don't know if it
came the day after but I flew out and
went away the holiday right and then I
came back to find my parcel with
raindrops keep falling on my head there
are raindrops on my parcel it was at
least worth the tub it was dashed onto
my porch
yeah it was dashed off my foot it was
just sitting there lying with the
raindrops and mud on the outside of the
packet it was a WoW it's really a while
the delivery man actually just dropped
it there and the thing is this like you
know I do have a gate but I didn't close
my gate when we went away sometimes I
don't close it and it was just there
anybody could have just walked in and
snatched my in the spout or Dido edit
you know it's just it was left in the
dirt right not that he didn't even try
and hide it he didn't put it like at a
corner or behind the port or under
something so there we go my order is
here we're gonna try some of these
goodies on we're going to test drive
some of these and take them out as well
and let's get into this video so guys
this is the first little number from in
the style and I think we're getting off
to a good start
I wanted this jumpsuit for my holiday
you know in Dubai a little bit more
conservative and this would have been an
absolutely really cute number I love the
fact that the bottom of these trousers
are actually extra long like this is my
normal height this is my like tippy-toe
height and as you can see like it's
relatively long but I think it's
actually a really cute colorful job 234
pounds 99 I think the price is actually
quite good and the fabric isn't bad at
all it's like kind of like a silky
Shivani
but it's quite thick it isn't like
then I'm silky material it's actually
quite nice it's got like a crate to it
but I've had to put a little bit of her
I am also going like a little hairpin
there because we were doing a bit of gay
page and you know I'm a bit worried
about gay pigeon nowadays you know we're
not gonna show too much gaming look we
parked all the way open it isn't too bad
there aren't any pockets or anything on
this I think it's genuinely a really
cute little okay guy so here we have
this little asymmetric number going on
it's it's a little bit a little bit you
know cat suit II is doing Oh calm
we've got shoulder cleavage we pop have
a cool clean baby you've got cleavage
cleavage and and some extra craps here I
get it I feel like it's a nice little
unique piece but hey Here I am I'm doing
something different I don't think it's
bad what I will say is I really feel
like the fit is quite really don me
because I have a short torso so I think
the middle of this is really long it's
really really long like this is where my
my YouTube don't censor me region is and
then the bottom of the trousers is a lot
no I sent all the way down here and my
region is like around here it's like
what what is that extra gap for but
again I have a naturally shorter torso
and I notice that makes a difference
but even if I pull this up it's gonna be
I'm looking to have that gap I don't
know this pitifully fit but it is still
cute I totally get why someone would get
something like this for this quite
unique so I kind of katsu element and oh
I think we so can you guys see that
warning warning
oh Lord we have a hole right down the
middle of this 39 pound 99 John sue um
yes I don't know why that has happened
because it's not like I put my toe from
that and that is unfortunate I do feel
like this would be nice for someone who
it
more suitable for their body type but
instead it looks like I'm trying to hide
like a missing penis and now we have a
hole in the back so I'm not gonna be
wearing this number okay so next time I
picked up this jumper
how cute is this jumper I feel for me
this is gonna be amazing
so I'm gonna wear this out in the week
of me I think it's nice I think it's
like the cute little blue jumper and
it's wearable out on the actual streets
of life so a picture of these wide leg
pants they're super cute I'm really into
wide leg pants I thought they look
really nice and then I picked up this
lace little bodies because I was
thinking that this could look really
cute like a blaze on top of it okay guys
so this is this look right here not bad
these trousers they fit very very very
well I actually love the crotch on
reason we need a name crotch should we
call it crotchal region
yeah the crotchal region looks good the
trousers are size 8 and actually the
crotch or weak region is perfect to
unknown me and I'm very happy of that I
actually think they're quite nice
they're not exactly like that the
thickest material but they are like
blind so there is no there it you yes we
don't have any mm let me Nicolai yes I'm
good on you good on you a good trouser
you doing well the thing I must say that
I've noticed from trying on for the
clothing that I tried on so far there's
something wrong with the zips the zips
are really really harsh I met hard to
pull up the zips are really bad should I
say hold on oh I'll do it when I put my
legs together we have we're just gonna
call in angry camel angry camel but
let's just put our legs apart with cute
no camel and it's cute together
angry camel but to Venus you don't meet
Wow Wow you don't really need to do this
so you're just gonna you're just gonna
do this we're just gonna stand like this
so the trousers cost $24.99 in terms of
this like mesh
it was a pain to get on it was so tight
so so tired
this piece of this piece of doily this
piece of duty is $14.99 and it doesn't
even fit you at better off just buying a
cup of actual piece of underwear for the
same price that's going to give you more
coverage and actually fit more because
this is so small so tight and it's like
it's nice enough quality to cost that
much not at all Oh oh yeah okay not this
okay so this is another one I picked up
this is another lace little body yes
this is actually nice I love the fact
that it is smooth and I can see it's got
the lace detail and little I mean it's
kind of giving me little bo-peep but I
don't know where that's the minute like
on I think that this should get test
driven for the week I'm gonna wear this
we're gonna see how it looks have to say
this jumpsuit I love the color of it
rich and Carl are rich in life I feel
like I'm turning into a girl who looks
good in blue what have you bought well
people this is not nipple to the wind
it's not really to the wind its life
life to the wind people this is all the
ways open at my office why why is it
doing this this is also a size eight
jump too so I don't understand where the
other one was a size 8 jumpsuit and fit
like a dream this is also a size 8
jumpsuit and we've literally got ribs my
ribs out on show why are my ribs out and
show what is going on right here
loans life ribs hot everything is out
it's actually if it's really good right
here right here fits really nicely the
color is gorgeous I love the pattern Lee
it's so nice and then he is beyond
tightly
give any movement or anything right here
on this band it was a pain to get on I
just I just I don't know what to tell it
comes and sits comfortably just by my
armpit so I'm very confident
who made this who made this but it is it
had such good visions I love the idea
how does the model look this bottom part
right here is snatching snatching for
dear life oh I'm so annoyed people have
been don't you know how she got to try
and hit this off my god Oh see what what
had happened was what had happened was I
wanted to pull all the TVs this is a
cute little two-piece and weaknesses
from the tummy hem bro collection you
know it's got these shiny pairs that
Shannon and I already record them shiny
I've called them always Sheen yeah
they're shiny and shilling and they're
active relative clearly I've got a thing
around pants at the moment and the wider
the cure for me however the top is
literally a pamphlet a wipe your hands
on a paper napkin it's if the top is
smaller than my bra literally smaller
than my bra so we're not really gonna be
able to cover very much and I cannot see
this a top like this to me personally
making it out into the public triangle
is this big I don't feel like my boobs
that that big I just feel like it super
small the trousers however the
individual trousers are cute I think I'm
gonna rock these this week I think I can
make them work and wear them out at some
point in time it's got this lovely
little like Bowie detail right there and
the Bowie detail right here which i
think is cute and what I like about
these is that the high waist is really
really high it's like well above my
belly button high which I love the
Shriners cue please beneath the pamphlet
top is 24 pounds 99 I just got I just
can't find
me look at the amount of material the
wide leg trousers are 29.99 which i
think is relatively good and I think
never nice fit is well lots of material
here just let me know tell me how this
is $29.99 and this is $24.99 this piece
has got a bit of shine going on - it is
39 pounds in 99 I mean it isn't bad it
just seems a little bit scratchy I think
I have something I can wear on the
inside so let me put that on okay
honey's look at this this is the shiny
little number isn't it oh it's it's a
little bit cheeky as well I try to wear
it like I saw on the website and I think
it's quite nice and love the way the
kind of shininess the shininess I love
the way the fabric looks like against
the skin and stop when I wear this on a
night out um yeah with a pair of high
heels if I wanted to be extra and come
up into the building of like hair
darlings you know give them a little bit
of side chic as well I don't hate I
think it actually looked quite nice not
that I think it's quite nice um sexy
darlings but I wouldn't go out with just
a body underneath personally I'll put
miniskirt underneath that's just me that
is just me you know um I'm not mad at
that
I also picked up this very casual piece
jeez it's lolis smaller than the dress
is it really that long who knows what
right okay this one I'm gonna wear this
out as well so keep watching I'm gonna
give you my final thoughts and also take
you out and about in somebody's outfits
okay so today the first day wearing in
the style and I thought that I would
wear this jumper slightly cropped
baby-blue I really hope that my belly is
not going to be on show when I'm wearing
this
oh I think this that's really cute on I
think this looks super cute on I mean I
do slightly look like a baby I've been
the next a little bit big Oh God
okay actually I thought it looked cute
on but I don't know it's giving me
slight mushroom heads oh oh never jacket
on top it's slightly decreased the
squareness I was given I was given
cuboid and not very square but the
jacket on top has made it work so by the
way I have paired this with my favorite
watch this is my square watch which is
upside down from Henry London they I
have a discount I can get you guys yes
this is a little bit of a sponsor just
the little one but it's definitely worth
it I have the details in their
description bar below if you want to get
your hands on a heavy London watch I
love these watches of work with them in
the past they're super cute they've got
so many different styles make sure you
check them out because they cute so
annoying thing number one look my makeup
has already got all over this jumper
look at that
can you see it I cannot imagine what its
gonna be like for an entire day oh my
gosh okay off for a spin honestly all I
keep thinking about is the just the
makeup going in their jumper I'm really
upset like that not that I buy let's go
the first no what do you believe your
output - they're good I like it not
gonna lie this crop top the breeze is
coming in and
is cold is so cold but it looks cute but
this is more of a jumper that's like for
design versus action because yet no no
honey
so she levels Shan levels are high but I
think the trousers fit amazing but the
the top and covering and covering it all
with my head so I think what I'm gonna
do is I'll keep the pants on but I'll
wear the other top I like the pants
pensive perhaps a nice actually think
that they they're shiny but they're
actually cute I'm not mad at them and
they fit nicely and my poop is poppin I
still really like this top I just find
that it doesn't fit amazingly like it's
a bit gay pee and I put on a nude bra on
underneath because I just felt like it
was just doing the most but my sad in
Chaucer's do look kind of cute so yeah
being all boos in fancy in the carpark
guys how shiny and how reflective are
these I feel like they are but I feel
like they look kind of cute like I'm
gonna walk in like I mean bit
I mean business darlings yes darling I
don't want anyone to see what I think
I'm really weird to be honest the top is
not and it's not nice it's not enjoyable
like it looks a nice I'm far but
practically this doesn't duck it doesn't
make any sense
you know everything flying out and I
feel very uncomfortable I'm pulling
myself
I don't like cloven that becomes a bit
of a bother which is what this feels
like that let's go another day in in the
star today is a slightly hobo esque day
going to the office today it's actually
snowing it's cold as a mofo and yet the
other items I have from in the style
aren't necessarily gonna cut it so this
is one of the tops that I bought there
was also a t-shirt is this like
like overlord it's kind of like
dressing-gown material I love the fact
that the sleeves are really long as well
I love extra long sleeves and I actually
love the length of this oh and it's got
a pocket region oh my gosh it's really
long this like Lewis up to my knees I
didn't realize it was that long it does
make me kind of look a bit just frumpy
wearing my hoodie yeah what do you think
of it I think it's super cute I like the
color
yeah I think it's a tad long I do think
that it's kind of giving me jump for
just vibes but I think it's actually
meant to be kind of worn like that
did you would diffic my jumper but it's
not like Ruffolo it's like kind of the
law I don't explain it like I mean short
pile little guys okay guys so now time
for my final thoughts especially when it
came to actually wearing the items out
and about I mean I didn't do they
clothing as clothing but I do feel like
you can tell the difference between good
climbing and just you know get on cheap
building and I think that you know there
was a balance and a bit of variation
between some of the items I found from
in the style so the fit in like oh we're
gonna have to mark down we're gonna to
give you a 2 out of 5 when it comes to
some of the fittings some of the stuff
fit beautifully like that first jump
suit fit absolutely stunningly like what
on earth might be if we made I don't
know what that was miles apart from the
other item that other job to site why
was once so good at once so bad
price-wise and it's definitely not cheap
cheap it's not like five pounds around
that tough whatever that kind of things
not everything for a pounds but it's not
ridiculously expensive but again I feel
like if I'm gonna be 40 pounds for a
jumpsuit or something it shouldn't be
getting a hole in it on the first
encounter and blue Trump are actually
gorgeous loved it would wear again it's
in my closet for life and
just you know some of the other pieces
were nice but it's like and this is what
happens do you ever get buyers regret
that you buy something you wear it and
you're like oh I've got to keep that now
I've worn it and you don't really like
it that much and that's kind of how I
feel like about that lace top because
every time I was wearing it I just felt
like I could just feel the breeze the
breeze was anywhere blowing on me
and then finally returning the other
items are fine but you know you have to
do it within 14 days I will say that I
have got a ton of mailers now like I got
I get a mailer from in the style every
single day I've got a different inbox
that I use when I make my own personal
purchases or clothing purchases so it's
not like my Patricia price email so
people don't know who I am when I make
an order online and litchi the inbox is
like in style in the style they do have
discount if you download their app they
do have 50% off ID so that was an offer
I get text is about 20% off 30% off
every other day there's one kind of
offer from in the style they are on I am
on speed dial for them for some other
reason so that's something else that I
know is from these guys but overall I
mean if you see a look that you're after
or you saw something that you really
like wearing something like they created
something and you'd liked it I would
have a problem in trying it out but I
wouldn't go there for like oh yeah I'm
gonna start chopping up my wardrobe with
clothing from in the style no not it's
not this enough for me and but I will
give it a I was gonna say 3 out of 5 but
I feel like that's coming on it's a two
point four out of five two point five
out of five I heard if that's a good
rating or a bad rating rating I think
it's an average it's an average rating
personally no tea no shade no nothing
because those two pieces there that
looked absolutely cute so guys that is
it for me I know that video was a little
bit more detailed because that is what I
wanted to do I wanted to bring you some
more detailed information actually where
the clothing right outside of my house
and show you you know how I actually
feel when it's like ma'am I spent my
money on this and I gotta keep it so
