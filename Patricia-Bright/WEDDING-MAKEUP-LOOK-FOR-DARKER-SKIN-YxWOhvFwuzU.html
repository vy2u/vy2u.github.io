I have loving jeong-ja laryngitis I'm
just recovering but I've got Esther here
and some of you guys might try to wonder
why do you whether s the from and to say
who you are and where they might leave
them and I start and I did Patricia's
makeup for her wedding and some of you
might know me as the Queen had asked
that was I have my own YouTube channel
on YouTube self yeah but you didn't have
a youtube when you did my Manor and I
have a long braids yeah different yeah
but we're gonna recreate my bridal look
just because you know it's been a year
now and I thought I want to be a
predicate no it's not true and but a lot
of people ask for you know how did you
do your makeup and you guys know I'm not
very good at doing makeup on this
channel so I thought I'd get an expert
to do my makeup on here and just show
you how I did it and hopefully it's
helpful and you guys can check out her
channel where we'll have another look as
well so I'm just going to start off and
do this and then hopefully it goes well
I'll just start by brushing through the
eyebrow is that a spite it's done start
yes oh is that so that's just
nw14 and foundation and this is eight
point five which is matchmaster the
foundation at you and now we're going to
be more MC 45 foundation I'm going to
dip it a little bit into the 8.5 so it's
not too light underneath your elf
it's cousin to all of the IRS that will
help keep - no one as well
really yeah the foundation and for my
foundation I'm using now but you could
use both your concealer on your eyes and
that will out the eyeshadow layer
I still go ahead and put a base yeah nah
mmm mmm yes so this is a look for the
word every time now now I'm going to
just apply an eyeshadow base what was
the base this one is called vintage
section it's a pro longwear pay pot from
Mac so I'm going to go in the crease on
the day we actually decided to keep it
more natural so instead of going to
smoky eye I just went move this cutter
here just called sketch
now I'm gonna go tan pig run but you put
all over the eyelid
the Nets like a war it's like a really I
don't really have to explain it's like a
warm silvery gold a touch of copper got
so flattering though on all women yeah
underneath the eyebrow I'm gonna go over
a bit of vanilla pigman got everything
in little pots make it vanilla yeah I've
had it for tonight
it's right mmm let's see and you use
this one remedy day yeah so just put up
underneath Trish's eyebrow Ridge I
remembered II think and I was
concentrating I don't have any beautiful
they care that day was fun so you've
come in a bit just so you guys can see
what I'm just putting that crease color
back in a little bit so as you can see
you like it still just very kind of bare
when the eyes we didn't go for too much
detail in the eyes really simple and
then put lashes on as well but then the
focus was really the skin nail down some
doing a flick first just going to line
underneath the eyes of a graphic liner
from Mac I'm using this eyeliner cuz it
doesn't smudge and it really stays / I'm
going back in a sketch I'm also going to
mix it with a little bit of purple
some good outfit Mustafa before putting
me lashes yeah beautiful
I so what's that a natural radiance
primer have tried it for is it good it's
good
NW for a pro longwear concealer from
foundations or I'm going to use this to
actually conceal right and highlight all
the other places I'm going to use a
little bit of your energy point farther
to out with it
so we're just gonna leave it like this
yeah I noticed you know I'm gonna need
this again a bit later but for now I'm
going to go straighten the 8.59 look
clearly so this is MC 45 reduce powder
is that good yeah I'm just going to put
news that underneath just to set with a
lighter areas they're still really
natural you know you don't have too much
on you have like three products it's
pretty much kind of normally no not
actually I'm going to do some contouring
and face so on the cheekbones and use
the purple and then on the inside I used
a warm Brown I've heard oh yeah let's
see do you remember that was a
concentrated like it's rock because when
you add the blush it were you at second
that's one grading then I'm going to go
this warm brown here which is Swiss
chocolate and fresh that into the brows
a little bit
I'm going cook pencil fat which is like
a brownish
