video is going to be on like wedding
planning essentials and I've kind of got
this because you guys have been asking
me for like wedding off day wedding of
day and to be honest I really think it's
a really big thing to try and accomplish
and try to organize and stuff like that
so I've kind of done this video self
issue for me in terms of the outlining
you know what I'm gonna do in for anyone
else who's getting married or thinking
about getting married which we've
probably order well not everyone and
sort of know what's involved this video
should be for you so what I'm going to
give you on nine essential points that I
think that you need for wedding planning
and if I've missed anything just please
let me know and leave a comment below
because I don't miss out anything from
right away in doing so let's get started
first thing that you're gonna need to be
honest is money so I'm average the
weddings in the UK are twenty thousand
pounds which is probably about thirty
three thousand dollars and I'm quite
young so oh it's a lot of money to try
and find now if you're working then
obviously what you could do is start
saving and put you some money aside and
for your wedding which is what I'm doing
and what I've got some money that I've
been putting this off ages and so as my
partner as well and all of you don't
have anything then at least a kind of a
future stream of money coming into the
pipeline
I really wouldn't jump into starting a
wedding well you ain't got no money
the second essential you're going to
need is going to be your guest list and
I think that guess this is the the most
thing because well the second most
important thing because you kind of
gives you a good estimation of what kind
of end you're gonna need I mean
invitation here but after send how much
money you're going to spend how many
going to educate for it's essential now
initially I said yeah it's gonna be 500
people and they're gonna be flying in
from Nigeria Liberia Algeria you know
wherever they're gonna be frightening
for for my wedding
and I realize that kind of trying to
cater for the wedding of that size is
gonna be extremely extremely expensive
and so I kind of know it my number still
at 350 but there's still a lot of people
and you know when you have an idea of
your guest list you can kind of see plan
your wedding all around your people -
the third thing you're gonna need is
your venue and one you know depends on
how many people you're getting and you
also need a venue that the worth unless
you're doing in the church that is
licensed for civil civil ceremonies and
where you can get you know a priest or a
registrar to come in and perform illegal
wedding in that venue not all venues are
registered to hold a ceremony in this
that's very important to consider and
your venue is kind of all depending on
what you want me I know what the color
castle manor house kind of thing some
people like you eat in hotels modern
location okay so your venue it is all
about what you want for your wedding so
the fourth thing you're going to need is
your registrar is only the person that
you have to do can legally marry you not
everyone can neatly marry you just for
they say I pronounce you husband and
wife
they must be registered I think on the
registers registrar's I don't own
membership lists or something like that
and you usually have to pay for one of
these in the UK I think it's between 400
350 to 400 pounds to pay for someone to
so you get married wowie so once you've
got all that parts for two that what you
want to do is organize your idea your
theme
what atmosphere is that that you want to
create for your wedding that'll be your
colors and your decorations and just you
know I don't know how you want your
wedding to appeal to you and to love the
youth invited I'm not going to tell you
guys my theme it's not you know it's not
a real thing but what kind of effect I'm
going to create for my wedding I do know
what it is now they yeah yeah maybe
nearer to the date then I'll tell you
all about that but yeah you start
thinking about that what kind of color
schemes you want what you want people to
be wearing and stuff like that and being
in my Geryon we did things quite
elaborately and we get you know chains
at three times and there's usually like
a uniform so you know what color is
everyone going to be wearing you ever
tell your guests to buy you know this
there's a particular lace that it will
be wearing haven't got my lace decision
yet but girl when I give my ladies let
me excited so actually I shouldn't have
put this sixth in the nest but this
should really be like thirty minutes and
what you want is your peoples and your
peoples are you know the people who are
going to be there by your side through
thick and thin organizing your wedding
really is quite stressful and it's not
the easiest thing to do in the world
you're gonna have your you know your
maid of honor
you're gonna have your bridesmaids you
don't know what to have the people who
gonna be there when you're crying and
something's gone wrong
who's going to support you and even
those you can even support you
financially which if they can but you
may not be everywhere that could be your
parents or something like that but
really know who those key people were
they know
conversation then can I trust you to be
there for me it's number seven and you
can now start getting all the good stuff
you're like food and your clothing and
what should put food and clothing in the
same category but you know all that
stuff makeup and clothing and stuff so
getting an idea of what you're gonna be
wearing what everybody else is gonna be
when your bridesmaid is your groom the
groom side of the things your parents
and all that kind of jazz and that is
wolf painful and it's stressful to think
about I'm not even started looking at
wedding dresses yet but you know you
probably need to set aside at least a
month to really find your dream yes if
you're not going to get it made
I may get mine made sometimes such a
cheaper to get it custom-made all some
people do rent so if you wanted a Vera
Wade will you rent a Vera Wang if you
wanted to and you know that's something
I could potentially think about I'm not
entirely sure not really fast about
designers that much but yeah you get
that stuff ready your makeup you really
need to have your makeup done at least a
month in advance and take a few pictures
because you don't want to end up looking
cakey and unnatural and not like
yourself in your wedding day because you
won't prepare your hair as well is a
great thing to get done beforehand you
know when they get it done in the day
and then you end up looking like a
poodle because they did something Sheree
coil your hair you don't want that you
don't want that so get this stuff
prepared in advance in terms of the food
you should probably do so get some
tasting done get some you know potential
menus done if you're getting a buffet
you know try out what they've got there
see the quality attend other weddings
where this caterer is there or just so
you can get a sample the food you don't
want to organize your transport so if
you're gonna come in on a horse and
carriage do you couldn't coming in a
Bentley a limo a tractor
how are you going to be coming in for
your wedding and also you know if I'm
think about my perspective I've got
people come in from
male in the South of England and
international is there any way that I
can make it easier for them in terms of
hiring coaches especially for the older
members of the family get their coach
down to the venue if you can afford to I
really love love to do that just to make
sure you are all at my wedding and even
providing transport for you
so on the day you're going to need to
have a checklist really you shouldn't be
checking your checklist well people
should be checking your checklist but
you know just know what should be on the
checklist just to know what's going on
the flowers here check is my hair done
yeah my makeup done yet is the
photographer here yet all that kind of
starts does check it off so you feel
calm and collected before the wedding
day so you don't think that you're
missing anything
a checklist is essential and finally
you're gonna need a man yeah so what is
a wedding planning he ever got a man
yeah that it's not gonna work
although you know speak those things
that I'm not I said they were he ain't
got a man stop laughing he might get him
back and he might be you a new bit crazy
but it's fine it doesn't matter Crazy's
alright
so guys I hope you enjoyed my video
