you are doing well today we're gonna get
into it we're gonna talk about careers
and jobs and fan on the job and know
what to do and some of you guys know my
background like I what as a city girl
for a very long time and then you know I
broke out of that and Here I am making
YouTube videos as well as doing other
things on this side as well so I wanted
to do something that would give you guys
a little bit of you know a raw life
perspective in my perspective and just
give me some advice I want to give a
quick shout out to my sponsors day coat
I partnered with them as part of the
diet coke break series we've got videos
over on Facebook I have them linked in
the description bar below so you can
check them out especially this one
because I've done some career girl
outfits with a twist
so I know what it's like up there ladies
and gentlemen I know if you are fresh
out of uni or if you don't really know
what you want to do when you're going to
uni if you are wanting a career change I
do know how difficult it can be because
I put my hands up I have been there so a
little bit about my journey is that you
know I firstly went to uni to study
international fashion marketing if you
didn't know I actually dropped out in
the first year and changed to accounting
because there's an accounting module I
liked it and I heard accountants make
more money so I was quick to jump ship
because I didn't like my fashion course
and I realized the reason I didn't
necessarily like my fashion course
because I didn't necessarily like I was
connecting I think we'd have any friends
and of course I didn't have any one's a
dog and I was just I was very shy I
didn't we know how to interact with new
people so I found it very difficult to
just connect when I was on that course
and then I ended up moving to accountant
and I kind of accepted that I was gonna
be a low not on my accounting course but
actually did end up making more friends
on my accounting course and actually
enjoyed that and then after I finished
University I ended up on an internship
program that I didn't missus any other
qualifications to be on but is that a
really top investment bank it was a
really good firm and I did the
internship summer interns
and got the rope but I did have a year
in between whereas in limbo where I
wasn't actually doing anything besides
working um in a hospital for a
consultant
it was the most random job ever but it
was a job because I wanted to make you
know some money cuz that year I was
broke and then after I started on a
graduate program I was working I was in
that city girl lifestyle I was about
that life as you guys can see me now you
can kind of see me in my mind quite fun
happy-go-lucky kinda crazy random person
but when you're working in the city and
especially in that kind of corporate
financial environment there was not very
much time for all of this okay I wore a
shirt and a jacket and I was just very
serious and I worked at that place for
two years ish and then I was made
redundant and then I ended up continuing
working in the industry and I ended up
working in consulting which was
literally the hardest job of my life I
mentioned this to you guys many of times
that I used to you know get into the
office at 7:00 sometimes leave that 12
hour eat dinner breakfast lunch snack
everything was all at that desk in my
office because when you're working on
proposals and bids there is no sleep
okay you need to be doing FaceTime needs
working partners need to be seeing you
the grind is very very River like you
actually live that life and then I ended
up moving back into banking working at
really nice banking firm loved this
company it was actually amazing but what
I was doing on the side was taking over
and then you find me where I am today so
yeah I wanted to give you guys a little
bit of tips and advice when it comes to
but doing your own thing if you decide
to do it alone but also if you want to
kind of follow the career path and I ask
you guys questions on snapchat so I'm
going to answer those for you guys as
well today so number one if you are
thinking about going it alone make a
calculated decisions darlings I didn't
make my decision to do my own thing
lightly so I was working a good job on a
good
like I'm say I should be honest my
salary you know that I was on and I'm
not trying to show off or anything and
obviously when you work in the financial
industry it's a lot of money's you know
it isn't it's a big way it's a big hurry
and for me to just jump out of that was
because I could see something more
beneficial financially but also more
from what I wanted to do for my life and
I made like a five year plan I was like
listen we need to do some kind of
calculation but I had a spreadsheet and
I had everything to help me make a
decision when it had come to moving out
of my job so yeah if you ever plan to
just go it alone it's okay to like just
not necessarily jump it's okay to
do that but do take some thinking and
some planning beforehand so mine exit is
obviously to be patient everything takes
time nothing just happens I always tell
people listen I've been on YouTube for
look seven eight years right four years
till I made a penny on here and it took
I worked the entire time while I was at
uni and then I worked my jobs and I
shared my job career while I was on on
YouTube and you know i put continue to
do it and you know grow my platform grow
what I do look at whatever options I had
outside of it and that all takes time a
lot of the time people see like a finish
and shiny product and think yeah they
made it but the reality is about
anything that can come quickly can
disappear just as quickly and that's
saying of slow and steady wins the race
I think it's absolutely true for me I've
loved the fact that I've taken my time
with everything that I've done more
stuff coming soon keep your eyes peeled
ladies and gentlemen but I love the fact
that I've taken my time and actually
what I try to do is enjoy the process
and I think that if you are you know
worried right now about anything that
you're doing obviously just take a step
back and look at the process and just
enjoy the right the moment that you're
currently in and every single little
thing that you work on is actually a
stepping stone and when you are just
looking at
here eventually you'll realize that
you've got you know ten steps up and you
wouldn't have realized how you got there
because you were focused on what you
were doing in here and now that's really
really important one of the big
questions that I get is I don't know
what to do I don't know what career path
I should take I'm gonna give you a
confession people most people don't have
a clue what they're doing what parts
they're gonna take they just keep
grinding if you see an opportunity
before you right now kind of take that
and then you know if you see another one
take that take that take that every
opportunity lead you to somewhere don't
get caught up in that I don't know the
specifics of right now instead just
think right right now here's an
opportunity I'll take that I'll try that
and I'll see how it goes when it comes
to CV writing or anything like that for
those of you who are about that career
ladder life I've got a lot of people who
are asking me about working in
accounting mergers in that positions
financial market the number one thing I
think is important is to have a CV with
experience and so many who will say how
do you get experienced when you can't
get a job I know it is a catch-22 I know
how annoying that is however what I
think and I know it's a balance because
I know we don't all have money to work
for free
but try and see what non-paid work you
can get even if it's a case of you hound
a company down and say I just want to
shut it for one day a week I just want
to have a meeting and watch what the
manager does one day a week I will just
get his coffee one days a week I'll just
watch over shoulder and do some typing
for him one day a week now no one's
saying that you were there five days a
week nine to five every hour of every
day for the last three years no one's
saying that
but matter if you did one day a week
even if it's three hours a week
shadowing a senior manager in an
industry that you want to work in right
and you're there for six months you're
gonna learn something and whatever
you're able to learn from you're able to
put onto a CV and you can use that as an
example and I also say
come to CBS did you have to give real
life practical examples so I had a bunch
of things that I would do so I was doing
mentoring I worked in the young
entrepreneurship but I was present on
the afro-caribbean Society and I had
also done something where me and a group
of guys we came second place in like
this entrepreneurship idea we came up
with a cleaning business we did a
proposal I had all that stuff to say
that I was doing something you know to
put it on my CV you know be persistent
in actually getting that experience it
might not be paid for it might not be a
full-time gig but I think that everybody
can commit to an hour or two hours to
sit on someone's shoulders and not
necessarily pester them but ask them
questions a couple of questions learn a
bit more off of your time and your
services for free no saying permanently
you might still need to do a little
night job or a side job we do what we've
got to do but that is a way to get that
CV experience on there how do I make
myself stand out trying to get a grand
job in finance for next year the biggest
piece of advice is to brush up on your
knowledge if you know anyone in that
industry go down some questions find out
what's going on relay that information
to your interviewer again when I got my
internship the reason I kind of got my
internship is because I had slightly
been involved before so I attended the
Women in Technology dinner and I was the
girl he was at Kean keenbean I had gone
there with a notepad and pen I had
preset out questions for all the women
there there was a senior manager there
senior man I was like so where do you
see the financial markets in the next
few years I've heard that this will be
happening with regulatory changes what
are you gonna do to hedge yourself
against the risk of doubt market risk oh
I don't know say I was saying all sorts
personally I didn't actually know I was
talking about
however I've done a little research I'd
spoken to my friends and he's like she
talks this question how do I get a job
in fashion marketing if I haven't
studied at university okay so studying
something university doesn't necessary
that is the only way to get a role or
learn how to do that thing University is
a step up but most people don't
necessarily use that course for what
they do as a career if you have a
passion for creativity that's step one
not everyone is creative right and I
think that everything can be learned
online you I'm looking at going into
creating my own fashion line coming real
soon and I am doing this by myself
I don't necessarily know much but I'm
gonna teach myself everything I need to
know there are online tutorials there
are websites there with YouTube videos
there are other people who have founded
businesses and I just listen and I learn
and I like what did they do
what's the step that they did I will
take any little snippet and I'm gonna
apply that to whatever I do what do I do
if my college course doesn't call it
correlate with the industry and what to
go into in the future I mean if your
current course is Chemical Engineering
and you want to go into veterinary
science then I can understand why that
would be difficult but a lot of the time
courses and the university is really to
help build with people's minds when it
comes to learning to learn because you
have to keep learning how no matter how
old you are and I'm not gonna like I
kind of missed that concept of doing my
research
writing a thesis do my research do an
exam do like and that is life anybody
who decides that they don't want to
learn any more you're missing out don't
think that education is over once you
leave school because that's when you're
just you know feeling won't be
successful anymore but if your course
doesn't correlate it doesn't matter if
there's an industry that you want to be
in apply the principles of learning that
you're picking up on your course into
learning about that industry and if you
can change course then do that hi
Patricia
when and what made you decide to quit
your job and be your own boss
as I mentioned me leaving my job was a
calculated decision
I was not unhappy and I was earning good
money right and you know the firm
housing was amazing and shout out to
every when you worked at that company
cuz they know how much like I had a good
time and it's probably the best way that
it worked and I wish that I got there
earlier on in my career because it's
such a great place but what I could see
was that I had a lot of
potential lot of opportunities coming
and I could have balance working with
her with the opportunities as I mention
I don't know if I mentioned this but I
never had weekends for probably four
years I did YouTube on the weekends I
did YouTube on the evenings I worked
late at night I'll be out my house early
in the morning and all I did was YouTube
and all that kind of stuff and you know
on my days off I was going to do shoots
and I would you know take a cheese out
for Wednesday off and I'll go shoot here
and I'll shoot there come to month to
work on Monday and nobody knows that I
will be shooting a campaign for a
magazine or I'd be shooting with a
really nice really amazing brand nobody
would know but eventually I couldn't
match the number of days I would have to
take off and I couldn't do it
so I kind of came up with the plan I was
like right Trisha I'm gonna make that
move how can you find a job within your
passion and create a business with your
passion I think when it comes to
creating anything it's all about adding
value where can you add value to
something that's already existing can
you make it better can you make it
easier for people can you create
something unique and then can you add
money to it so even if you find a job in
an industry that you want to be in what
is it that you think you can bring to
the table that is gonna make that job or
that industry or that office better than
it currently is if you have a business
idea based on something you're
passionate about
look at what's already out there how can
you make it better for people healthier
and it's all about people
and whenever you make something you
wanna make a video I'm like how is this
useful for the person who's watching it
what value am i providing it's important
to be passionate but it's also be to be
packed it's also to be passionate about
creating value for the person who's
gonna receive or use or touch or watch
or eat your product and that's what's
important to think about okay the last
question is Patricia what advice can you
give to young women who wants to start a
company but is afraid to take action
because they're afraid of failure how
can you be fearless and just jump in
you're just doing it there was nothing
wrong feeling we all feel fear we're
meant to feel
it's natural but despite the fear you
feeling you do it like you literally
just push us up and you're like I'm just
gonna do it sometimes you do it like
through gritted teeth you just do that
thing try it if you're gonna lose some
money lose it and another thing I say I
learnt this from mentor which is you're
gonna fail fail fast don't spent five
years trying to fail spend five minutes
failing spending five hours
failing spend five months failing those
were your lifestyle failing fatal if it
fails at least you know it fell because
I think it's worse to feel guilty that
you didn't try to do something and the
more you kind of challenge your fear the
less be you feel so yeah that's my
advice so guys and that is the end of
this video I really hope it gave you a
little bit of inspiration a little bit
of insight into my story and I find that
I do get us a lot about careers and jobs
and do my own thing I mean it's really
important that people have what they
need someone's going to give them some
advice some insight it isn't that scary
but at the same breath I understand that
it is so if I'm able to help one person
out there my life is made leave a
comment below if you've got any thoughts
on this topic or if you wanna share
something off you have inquiries and
hopefully I'll do it in another video as
well but in the meantime make sure you
check out the Facebook page where I've
got my other videos as part of the diet
coke break series and I've got one to
come from this one which is about
twisting up the classic work wear
outfits and yeah I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
