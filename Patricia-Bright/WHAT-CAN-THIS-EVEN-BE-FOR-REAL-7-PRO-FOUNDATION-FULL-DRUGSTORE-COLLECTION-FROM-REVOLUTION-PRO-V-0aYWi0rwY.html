oh yeah that is what I'm talking about
hello beautiful people welcome back to
my channel I hope you are doing well
today I'm coming to you birth face and
beautiful because I want to do a full
face of something a bit new yes we've
got some new goodies out here and like
I'm sitting here I'm looking at my nose
and they actually look like stumps I've
basically had acrylics for ages and boy
my nails are just doing all kinds of
suffering and that is another story for
another day but today I wanted to get
into a full face of a revolution pro
revolution Pro is basically a new brand
but it's part of revolution Beauty
revolution Beauty owes makeup revolution
and revolution Pro and I'm sure that you
guys have seen makeup revolution have
literally been popping up everywhere
with the 6-pound concealer to the
5-pound foundation sticks to the Sophie
palette like it's one of the most
popular drugstore brands but it's really
really affordable and so revolution Pro
is a new brand under that group and it's
you know more cater towards Pro makeup
this is not the same price as makeup
revolution but some urinates is still
it's still negative it's like 7 pounds
50 for the foundation I don't think this
video is not sponsored I've not been
asked by makeup revolution or revolution
Pro to make this video I went to the
launch party I saw the stuff I had a
goodie bag I took a couple of extras and
so I just put them in my goodie bag and
so I've got enough hair to do a full
face so let's get into it let's see how
well these stop perform ok so there are
two different foundations there is the
full cover camouflage foundation and
then these are these foundation drops
and then they have two different
formulas so I'm going to put one on one
side and one on the other and see what I
think of the foundation but first thing
I'm gonna start off with the matte
primer koechli before I go with the
matte primer I'm gonna go with glossy a
super balance because my skin is really
really really dry at the moment I don't
know why but listen I need I need all
the hyaluronic in the world right so I'm
gonna go in with
Matt's primer and this is a
silicon-based matte primer my shine just
went down I mean it's done the job
it's definitely done the drop and I like
the way it feels on my face as well so
I've got shades 18 to 12 in the
foundation drops and I've got 12 to 18
in the full-coverage camo foundation so
let's swatch 12 13 14
oh that 14 is nicer than the makeup
revolution 14 I had the makeup
revolution 14 and it was a little bit
too gray on me it was a bit too ashy but
actually the 14 and knees is really good
15 I don't have 16 but I've got 17 which
is nice and dark 18 super rich 18 the
formula is actually quite thick quite
full coverage over here we're going to
start at 18 fill that the colours are
very very similar 1716 yeah red 15 can
you see how red that 16 is I usually mix
the 16 and the 14 oh this is 13 I don't
have 14 okay so this seems to be a more
hydrating or juhi formula and this is a
much more matte formula so these ones
seem a bit richer in a bit warmer than
these one I actually quite liked the
idea of mixing number 13 and number 15
together to get a really nice shade but
you can see none of these are like a
perfect match for me and none of these
here are a perfect match for me all
right let's just get 13 on and you know
what I know it slightly like oh I love
the warmth in this where anything is oh
I was thinking how do you want to apply
this and it's obviously a pipette and a
dropper there we go that's a bit
different
I've not really seen people do pipettes
in foundation skincare yes not
necessarily a foundation that's 13 and
I'm gonna mix a little bit of 15 of it
this is definitely a Julie floor formula
your girl is looking moost that really
sunk in really beautifully and looks
really skin light like it's just giving
me like in enhance glow and I feel like
I can use that 13 just by itself I feel
like it's full coverage on me because
obviously my skin is quite even it looks
quite nice I don't know if you're
someone who's got like you know lots of
hyperpigmentation or like quite major
skin issues I don't know how much
coverage it's going to give you because
can you see how it's given me a really
natural just even glow but it isn't like
your girls be but I don't think this is
what this hash foundation is for so I'm
going to go over here and try the
camouflage foundation I really really
I'm gonna use 13 it's a bit like oh it's
a because it's a bit night girl and a
touch of 14 as well
do you know I really like the name it oh
yeah this is full coverage this is full
for the coverage either little a little
goes a long way wow it's pretty well
oh there oh wow okay I didn't realize
how full coverage that was okay wasn't
ready but I liked it
you see what there is where I am a full
coverage girl I like a full coverage
look oh I like that it was it she won
one pump and it was like doosh
yes we're happy we like this because um
as I mentioned that I used the makeup
revolutions foundation stick and it was
it wasn't ideal it was a little bit oily
this is matte this foundation is 7
pounds darling it is 7 pounds and it is
giving me you know it's like a five
pound coverage but even this side this
is like you wear this in the day you had
this okay so they've also got the
camouflage concealer and there's lots of
different shades
I've got shade C 13 that's the darkest
shade I have I don't think that's gonna
be dark enough it's a little bit on the
like pinky side as well let's go in with
C 13 anyway I think to be honest I would
have prefered ac-12 just to give me that
really light
look but I didn't pick one up the girl
couldn't find it it's reminding me of it
cosmetics I can't lie it's real thick it
genuinely reminds me of bye bye
under-eye which is actually really good
concealer
bye-bye under-eye so you can see is
quite uh I will say a little bit of an
oily concealer but the coverage is
really real oh yes we like all of this
okay I feel like I definitely need to
set like I will need to set this but I'm
impressed I'm impressed
I'm just going to use my Setia Buttercup
to to set under my eyes and I'm gonna
use it this zoeva brush and you know
I've gone past the days of like baking
out it when you bake any more the powder
really sticks to the concealer so it's
gonna be important to you know move of
caution I was gonna use c---seventeen to
contour but I think it's too dark so I'm
gonna use c16 okay I recently had my
eyebrows micro braided as in like just
under a week ago so you're not meant to
put anything on your eyebrows for 10
days but you know don't don't do what I
do because I'm about to put a little bit
brow product on okay so yeah I had micro
bleeding done I just really did it at
the ends where I was just really patchy
and I basically have no hair here now so
I will definitely still need brow
products but I feel like it's made a
world of difference I'm gonna try the
revolution brow pomade oh okay there's
an eyebrow definer there's a brow pomade
and an eyebrow definer let's use the
definer I wonder if this is kind of like
the cushion so I'm gonna just use an
angle brush I think that the little
mirror on this is so perfect
because really when you're doing your
eyebrows you need to be able to see them
up close me okay we filled out nicely
really really soft really really gentle
not too dark I like the color it's
giving me like fullness without the kind
of really darkness I'll be honest I
don't usually use that creamy definers
like this this is kind of wet this isn't
a pomade it's not a gel don't know what
you call this but I like it so that's
that brow it's more like a shader it
doesn't give it didn't give me like
individual strokes like Africa Joe will
give me but it just filled it in and
made
look a little bit more luscious and I
really like the color it's not too red
it's more like a very sore skin grayish
Brown fYI this camouflage concealer is 5
pounds it's excellent excellent quality
right so gonna come in I'm gonna go
ahead and use a combo of these two
palettes and come up with something
pretty this palette is eight pounds
Hispanic new sixth power oh great it's
really great oh look at that marbling
though that's cool that's a really
really nice I remember my mind's eye
really like that okay what we gonna do
so I always like to use MC 11 actually
from makeup revolution under my eyes
like before I put my eyeshadow on cuz it
just kind of makes the colors pop a lot
more me but it'd be crazy if I did like
a blue I feel like doing a blue eye
which is really unlike me I'm gonna go
with parameter and I'm gonna use that
just right here that actually looks
darker on my eye than I thought it would
but it would look more ashy and gray but
it doesn't I'm gonna go ahead and use
all but all that's a real friend really
unexpected actually it's kind of like a
burnt red I'm gonna add some more of
this shade here called terrine yeah very
different there they look similar
they're very different and then on my
lid I'm gonna just add a little bit more
concealer and I'm gonna do this trick
right watch this this helps you to carve
out a really good halo
we're going with Mars this nice kind of
marbling effect
it's the shimmer with that being a
bitter it's not a good I thought it
would be more of like a glittery effect
but it's not but it's a really good and
well pigmented shimmer I'm gonna go in
with this one here I feel like it would
be nice just to add just I don't know
something like this like oh just to add
another dimension to it and to be honest
what this palette is lacking is like a
nice Brown like that so I'm just gonna
steal some from here eyes are done
I think they look super cute I've got
some long ass dramatic lashes that is
what I can find in my pot oh yeah I
don't normally wear dramatic lashes like
this but this I look still looks cute
really pigmented I love the way the
color has come out the last goodies I
have in the collection are the pro
supreme matte lip pigment
let's just run with one of these okay
this is called shade illusion which is a
nice nude so maybe it topped orangey I'm
gonna go in with my chestnut cuz what
would I do without my chestnut and might
say it's a little bit orange e for this
look so I'm gonna try this shade called
assemblage was it set semblance I don't
know oh yeah that is what I'm talking
about super creamy that seven blonde
shade is beautiful absolutely beautiful
it's super creamy it doesn't feel like a
matte lip on it's not right dry it's not
dried matte on the lip and actually
doesn't look that matte on camera but it
looks gorgeous I like the way that looks
okay and this is that revolution Pro 4k
highlighter palette well giving me who
the Buddha teeth oh but the Gold's are
all fantastic on this well strong a
little bit glittery
but the gold is a really nice you are
gold this is a really nice gold almost
on the verge of the kind of trophy wife
greeny gold that once and might go with
that one that's what that looks like
it's quite a gaudy gold because of the
gold I pick on this one I picked less of
that
I prefer this version of the goat but
it's still nice it's really pigmented
it's a little bit on the chunky glitter
side a little bit chunky glitter some
people like you know a chunky boo-booed
or whatever so yeah but basically this
is the full face of revolution Pro in
total you're looking like about a 5 10 8
pounds 13 pounds listen this is about a
30 pound face this is a I feel like I
look really good for how much this
actually cost really surprised really
impressed obviously to burnish I've been
really impressed with makeup revolution
in regards tonight just the
affordability side of it and obviously
the concealers are amazing I really like
the way this foundation went on and look
this is their like the carpet the
camouflage foundation but this one's
still gorgeous and fantastic anyway the
pigments popping off on that I like
popping off like come on the matte lip
this is a magnet it doesn't it's not
going matte and dry but does it look
like a matte lip yeah it looks like a
matte lip but it isn't it's not dry it's
not dry like a matte lip at all
I don't know how that's gonna work out
up when it comes to wearing it but I'm
really impressed with the way that you
know and look right now how it's come
out revolution Pro and down and the
thing is is I do
I love expensive Beauty I love you know
a little bit of a Gucci moment and when
my Tom Ford and all that good stuff but
of course I like a bra key as well you
know if we can look like we were a
million dollars for 35 pounds then we
should do it yeah so that's it that is a
full face of revolution Pro it's new I
think can definitely buy it in
drugstores you may be able to purchase
online as well if you can I will link
down below let me know what you think
would you buy some revolution Pro or are
you more like I've got expensive taste
when it comes to makeup so guys that is
it from me I hope you enjoyed and I'll
