darlings jeez this box is heavy zoeva
well they're beautiful people work into
my channel I hope you are doing well I
just want to caveat today's hairstyle is
what I'm gonna call like a transition
hair start but because I kind of not
made a mistake but I decided to like cut
a fringe have any of you guys ever done
that and like we've gritted it entirely
so I've kind of got this thing slightly
long slightly not sure if it's the
middle bang side bag and kind of thing
going on this is my transitional hair
style so we're just we're just gonna
work with it until you go can get
herself a new Wiggy
but yeah what do you guys think have you
ever done that were you like oh I want a
different look cut a fringe and then
been like oh my gosh like honestly and
today we are doing an unboxing right I'm
gonna share with you some of the goodies
that I've received in my PR but what I
also wanted to do was kind of try and
build out and do a full face if I can
with some of the goodies that I'd get in
my PR I like to say this all the time
whenever I do these like massive
unboxings I'm you know lucky enough to
be a youtuber I am so privileged to
receive items like this I did a huge
giveaway in February and I've picked six
winners who have opened the EM so that
has already happened and as much as I
can try and get back I do but the whole
point in these kind of unboxings is to
kind of show you what's new I find
myself I find out what's new because to
be honest I don't really stay in the
loop like that like what comes in my PR
I'm like oh that's cute but I know lots
of people can do unboxings and then not
actually show if they use the stuff or
if it looks any good on them so that's
what we're gonna do today darlings if
you're not subscribed subscribe and yeah
let's just get into this video
well okay then to face this is a bit
dramatic isn't it I had to pick this one
up first because it obviously looked the
most dramatic it has a little bat but my
daughter's taken the bat already so
we don't know where the bat is right
about now but it is a pinata now they
may I don't know what happened so why
was you beat the pinata and then sweets
fall out but how does it break because
this is quite sturdy so here's the PR
info and this is from like the festival
collection there's all rainbow and
unicorn esque in unicorn tears
iridescent mystical bronzer lipstick lip
tapa jeez let's get a lot in here
alongside that came a strobing brush
this must be the palette is this the
eyeshadow palette it's so cute that is
so cute I do think this palette is cute
there's lots of colors in here I am not
likely to use but there are definitely
some I think are quite cute and I
actually would use they're all shimmers
but the giving me pigment they've got
good payoff let's have a look at that
rainbow live sunset dreams Fun in the
Sun and fireflies cute this is actually
really nice I wonder if I could use this
no way you instantly open something and
it's weird it's blue but can you see
it's not blue so that could look nice on
top to be honest I don't like the whole
like the training that when makeup isn't
what you think it's gonna be or it like
changes but no people like that because
you know my initial reaction is like
what is this my back is already up but
that looks like that will look really
nice on top actually I wonder what the
green ones gonna look like on ah it's
got actually it does look kind of green
there okay okay the the whole collection
is really good the whole collection is
weird
these are lipsticks in a blue and a
yellow maybe only I haven't seen these
before
check these out the blue is looking
pretty blue the blue is looking pretty
blue I'm just putting this on but it's
making me look slightly ill this is the
blue which is meant to change to your
body chemistry I've just read the PR the
packaging is so cute this is a bronzer
smells so good it smells so good oh this
is the highlight art I mean I can't lie
this packaging is adorable I think it
might be broken
you guys just saw about the parents
empty guys you saw that there's no cuts
this the slight residues that are left
of the empty pan look like they would
have been cute you know the residues are
available how strange
overall that collection is looking
fierce and fiery and fun and if you like
glitter and sparkle and unicorns then
yeah there's a lot of that I just feel
like I've got reflective dust on me
everyone's just like glistening and
shining we've got in here uh-huh
these are from l'oréal okay these are
the new foundation sticks okay so these
are the new foundation sticks this is
espresso this is 210 I think this is
probably too light for my skin but this
is a really nice contouring color for me
there are other shades but they've only
sent me these two so there's a primer
there's the foundations and then there
are the strobing highlighting sticks as
well
Thank You L'Oreal well we got here
finally foundations oh my gosh these are
from YSL Touche claw all-in-one glow
foundation that looks quite dark for me
but this looks beautiful
I could probably combine the two
all-in-one glow foundation so this is
gonna give me a glow and please check
these out look at this hello prime are
another blur primer pink and blue and
orange primers okay I think we can
finally get into it I'm gonna go in with
the foundations
oh it's this if it was a squeeze tube
but it's got a press button
nice that is probably a bit light but
I'm gonna add one pump of that and one
pump of the other one oh and of course
I'll use the primer I'm going to use the
pink primer because I mean I've never
used the pink primer before it's
literally so cute
look how candyfloss pink that is how
gorgeous is that
well it feels really really nice it
reminds me a benefit Porefessional but a
bit creamier Wow
it's a really nice primer okay let's go
in with the foundation I'm
with my Fenty foundation brush what
weight is short I think about that
foundation it didn't go on very very
full coverage but actually it is
relatively full coverage okay not too
bad not too bad at all two pumps and
I've got full coverage I had to mix both
with the shades because the first shade
was a bit light for me and actually I'll
go in with that foundation stick from
L'Oreal to conceal nice nice and yellow
I love it so that is super light
coverage I feel like would be excellent
for every day and I love how yellow it
is the question is how well does it last
but so far I actually feel like it
lifted my face and looks really nice
personally I love when there's makeup
tools that are handy this is handy this
is dandy I'm not gonna lie to you
sometimes my girls they open up my stuff
before I've seen it that's I heart the
packages up at Uwharrie open this isn't
makeup guys this isn't makeup this is
from Freya ah they did actually what my
bra size was recently oh well thank you
very much Freya you got some panties I
can always do more panties any season oh
I don't mind that thank you this is so
pretty oh my gosh I was looking for
something just like this like a long in
the body bra that I could wear at the
top although there might be nips to the
wind in this but you know maybe we can
make this work this is nice really nice
thank you guys and the panties are keep
warning hot AF that is so cute right
okay
the girls have opening what is it what
is in here some glasses people she they
look kind of cute I was gonna say that
they look kind of ugly but then ugly to
look pro-life looks horrible through red
sunglasses but I think they look alright
on it is it just me always is from the
grass is the way it's the Urban Decay
Naked Heat
poteete yes now we can do a little
island oh it's really small
damnit small but it's good I'll finally
oh I'm so excited for this
I have seen I saw everyone they are
doing videos of Nicole coming by name
and everyone was doing like videos that
sponsored videos I hate you know I'm not
jealous I'm not jealous yeah when was
this once of videos in this days you
know we always get left high and dry
over here but not gonna like it entice
me to want it to try it out so we're
going to do that right now I wonder if I
can combine this with this let's do
something let's get a little wild thing
and my old Charlotte told me brush
actually quite powdery but the pigment
is definitely coming through me you know
I really like about this is that it's
all mattes I feel like I hate pallets
and loads of shimmers I like more matte
and then a shimmer this is some really
nice mattes and what I feel like I've
been needing in my life I'm gonna go in
with this strike shade a little bit
darker and just create a little shape
I'm just carving out a little bit of a
cut crease because I'm gonna go in with
some shimmers from the Too Faced palette
so from this life is the festival
palette I'm gonna go in with this shade
here sunset dream Wow
okay it's not shimmery don't know what
made me think it would be it's not matte
but it hasn't got that like shimmer
shine I thought it would have ah right
we're gonna keep going maybe some
mascara or something will turn up we'll
see what we can get let's like do a
couple more boxes on the top this says
Lancome Paradis oh oh it's perfect oh
it's nice and mothers just I've just
given my secret Mother's Day is coming
mommy you got a pro that cover it for
you I hope you're not watching this oh
nice I love this perfume and it says
thank you on it does it I say thank you
on it Thank You Lancome this is what is
this but it's not that it's a cheap box
way looks like it's been relatively
youth unless my girls put it in this
maybe they did okay what's this glam
glow water burst hydrating moisturizer
love it oh no that is so cool that is so
cool
do you know what I love it when
Brande send me things like water bottles
or chargers or mirrors things like that
that are really useful
I saw someone receive something that was
like a coffee maker I was like listen I
want to be on that PR list this is
really cool though I do love water
bottles usually use of glass ones so I'm
talk about the water bottle we should be
talk about the product oh it's very blue
this is reminding me of Moisture Surge
from a Clinique which I love got makeup
on my face already so we're just gonna
you're just gonna use it on the neck and
the pickle ons you know you know you
gotta look after this region you know
it's important it's very watery but in a
nice way I love formulas like that
honestly more from more from Too Faced
geez you guys are on it Too Faced white
peach palette
I'm loving this I would have loved to
use that oh I might actually put that
glistening peach on top this is what I'm
after
this is what I was looking for we are we
are glistening in it or more not much
much more but it's not like really
really glittery but I feel like I need
like obviously like some kind of like
press clear or something okay Too Faced
Oh cleansing gel II can never go wrong
with the cleansing journey as honey and
a primal ash of use it on before that is
cute I have not received anything from
origins for quite a while so appreciate
that thank you

DHL there been fancy oh what's this this

palette loose powder okay it's matte
they've sent me everything I'm so like
shocked because I never see this much

now now we're doing the most over here
in my opinion but I know there are gonna
be people who love this volume one
highlighting palette volume two
highlighting palette I like this one a
bit more and then there is a ton of
pigments so they've been so generous I
want to share some of this with you guys

DM two of you guys to give you half of
my load because there's a lot here but

was a blueberry pigment this palette is
ridiculous

lot it's actually a lot it's way more
than I thought it would be little goes a
long way people okay we have something
else in here zoeva that was an ugly face
and a very ugly move but I'm very
excited the 10 piece brush set and
clutch soberness I think I already have
this I loves I love love love so either

well I don't have this because this is
new this is fancy this is new hello
hello new colors what is this
you've got new coloring from zoeva this
is new I don't have this like color
pouch and their brushes are fantastic so
bring it on that we've out bring it on
so I have a question for you guys do you
guys buy new brushes or do you just wash
your old ones
I wash like my favorite front ones and
then some of my brushes I do get rid of
but I actually this is my main brush
collection at the moment and then when I
get new ones I put them on the side and
then when these die I will replace them
oh gosh another set of Krag brushes and
a clock a Risto set I think I think they
need the bougie search darlings the
bougie sets darling if gold and black I
wonder what the difference is between
the brush sheds
it also comes with a brush pouch thank
you guys honestly okay I'm telling you
this is the unboxing of palettes
Joe Weaver so this is the Aristo palette
I think that this must be the palette
that goes with the Aristo brushes it's
got that kind of art deco feel and then
this palette is opulent oh okay that
right everything goes together the
brushes go with the palette and the
makeup bag oh this is a blush palette so
the Arista blush palette as well and I'm
presuming that this is also the opulence
blush palette Oh strobing gel strobing
gel strobing Joe it looks quite gross
I'm not gonna like the inside that's
really gross okay it feels great on it's
very light yeah I feel like you could
layer this like put this on and then put
a highlight on but it's a gorgeous gel
like feeling that evaporates but as you
can see them there just isn't very much
there
Lancome again we have some lip lacquers
colors pretty colors pretty cut this so
pretty oh it's just the almost like a
tin very Lancome very Lancome honestly
it feels really really nice very Lancome
it's literally just a tin I wonder what
this one's like mm they feel beautiful
autumn this is nice if you're just
trying to do a light look obviously I
need an it lighten up I just wanted to
see what it felt like on
kind of feels like not gel light but
kind of gel right not greasy and it's
almost like dried in weird formula but I
like it and I like that it's just a tin
so I've lost hope for an eyeliner
mascara so I'm gonna quickly put some on
okay lashes on we're looking good
