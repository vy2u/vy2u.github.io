on the front for me sighs welcome to my
channel today where my kitchen because I
felt like I needed a little bit of room
and there's going to be a lot of boxes
but today I wanted to do a PR on boxing
just to give you guys an insight into a
lot of the stuff that I receive now I've
been loving watching these videos a lot
of the guards in the states of being
kind of sharing the kind of stuff that
they receive in PR it's one of those
things that is a little bit
controversial because the reality is
that as a youtuber we are so lucky
enough one to be gifted so much so a lot
of opportunities and I mean I don't take
it for granted I really do not take it
for granted
I completely appreciate every this
everything I received I mean we just
have a lot of opportunity to try and
test and look at stuff I will also say
that we are not paid to show PR items or
anything like that a lot of the times PR
send you items in the hope that you
might try it and you might like it and
that you might share it that is normally
how it works for PR and the funny thing
is that like I might receive something
and then when I have a clear out I in
maybe six months later oh my gosh I love
that and I'm really linked to a lot of
stuff and a lot of us a little bit
worried about sharing the truth of what
we receive but you know what I think it
is important you know to share it and I
think some of you guys are like girl
once you got in there what you've got I
want to see and so yeah for those of you
who are like gift girl what you've got
honey what you're going to share them
that's what I'm going to do today is
well obviously I can't bear all other
makeup I can't keep all the makeup
so of course giveaways at hand I do
giveaway for a lot of friends family
women shout oh I get all subdued so I
don't just keep all of this stuff and
just hold it to myself that would be
crazy busy guys for mark it will be a
long one so I don't
having and it's going to go but yeah so
this is from bareMinerals it says make
up secure you can sleep in it oh and I
think what's gonna be quite funny like a
lot of the times when I use these PR
samples and this is no shade but a lot
of the times they send me somethings
that are for white gold like lychee it's
beige or like really really oh but
they're minerals they were bad they sent
me in neutral deep oh this is that
powder foundation
and they place it clear then if you guys
can see that they have extended their
range it is huge and they darker colors
in different types of tones you guys
know I'm a huge fan minerals fan so
thank you guys it also comes with this
brush the beauty finish brush but I've
never tried mineral powder I don't
really wear my powder foundation but
I'll be interested to see that I have
this big box of anastagi of Beverly
Hills and they send me stuff all the
ways on the state so let's not kill the
table now I'm not going to lie these
guys are so generous yeah look get rid
of the book look at this
I a police love it yo ah how
sweet it is colic is that you've got a
brush trio and I've got different colors
of these Austrians that come and look at
one or two okay
pool party very adore peachy love pink
passion cocktail party I didn't even
know Anasazi Indians rushes let's open
up the barrier door smells like a kid at
Christmas like mama what's inside oh
that is one hulking floor for the
chocolate girls okay we'll see what's
inside here it's just an envelope and it
looks like it's just one item so not too
much packaging right is going to have it
still dangerously
urban decay this is the all-night
setting spray long-lasting makeup
setting spray I think I already have
this in my collection or maybe this is
new I might try that another time I
don't know who this is from
aha from look fantastic
Oh normally it will say like look
fantastic so I get a monthly and beauty
box from look fantastic really really
good it comes with a magazine and it
also comes with Elle and they've got
Victoria Beckham on the front goals I
love her
this is a globe you look I had an early
access coming out actually partner with
them but they didn't tell me about this
like hello what's going on body scrub
coconut body's gone oh yeah system

James Reid this is a gap gradual tan I
don't have much need for that the 3

okay this has got handwriting on the
front a little front of it I don't know
if this is a key from a brand okay
alright this is from I Roja oh my gosh I
have heard about big a hearted it's a
little bit different these are the team
of the cops mark these are being sold in
Boots in the UK variety what other
products for you to try tissue must have
a splash effect you can see results in
15 minute a hyaluronic acid serum place
provides 10 times more hydration then
day/night cream oh okay
I like that how this best came at the
front look at my big smile
Jimmy oh thank you guys
oh my gosh and it's personalized so this
is the UK's number one cleansing balm
this is take the day off
oh it's very clear sometimes I don't
like cleansing on sometimes I find them
a bit too oily for my skin but it's
going to be worth the try how come I got
a mini one as well ah perfect for when I
go away take the day off and it says PBO
you guys can see Hamelin I've heard so
much about this and they also came with
a cleansing cloth which is easy to
surprise in front of it
that is gorgeous thank you thank you so
much sometimes it's really hard through
this oh yeah Kat Von D up in the booth
Vince can I get excited this better
rather get really excited all because
one previously we weren't able to get
this stuff in the UK and we see everyone
in the US and we're like this struggle
life or when we go on a holiday we'll go
to France and get to go to Sephora but
now we can buy stuff from Sephora though
it isn't cheap for delivery and also Kat
Von D isn't debenhams so are like
everybody's been telling me to get the
Kat Von D foundation this is the locket
foundation yeah okay I have to watch I
like I am took like today life as
remains perfectly okay okay to be or
nodule
oh and the issue is that you don't I
don't know who said this to me right and
that I want to thank them because
sometimes people send me the color and
it's just all wrong but this is so right
and I would have been like improv knees
Irene Irene Irene if you send it for me
thank you thank you I'm going to try to
anything I think they're the same color
there's no different than the same in
each one
same I think I might need one shade down
but this is one follow toilet coverage
full coverage on with us I want to turn
it out there's a press release of it I
really know if it comes to a car so this
is talking about the fact that there
were different shades at 13 can shade
and it's nice and rich and saturated and
that's what I really nice all right so
I've got the Kat Von D alpha miss
holographic palette but looking at this
I don't know how I'm meant to wear this
although I said the same thing about the
anastacio palette and it looked really
good on me
okay what's this everlasting liquid
lipstick okay oh yeah crucifix I'm not
gonna lie sometimes some of these names
on the Kat Von D are just giving me a
bit of funny side I just relaxed it's
okay color hmm whoever picked this knows
me mostly well okay let's do this this
big one here oh so my beloved local Mac
shakers my Lancome you know what you
don't want to ruin the box my mom is so
funny right if she comes to my house
house I I will see her sneaking
packaging I said I oh you think I will
give somebody present to me I'm like mom
just chill like go just smoke she would
save this like it was the best thing
ever oh wow wow look at that Mac shake
of the business is amazing that is
amazing now if you know about their
juicy shaker's they're really
moisturizing philosophy these are a
matte shaker and a lip liner the only
thing is is that I don't really wear
like pink or red in this - I always wear
Mike a dark brown or a Mose look at
these liners they also have a lipstick
brush at the end which is very cool this
Rose is a very nice color very creamy
clearly that's what these juicy shaker's
look like I'm very interested to see how
their maps that look quite glossy to me
but I think it's going to drive really
nice and matte the purple envelope ahaha
hurry up you guys know I'm a loyal and
battered up team a lore'l squad very
nice to be a part of it
and I think I don't know why they've
just sent me some more tree matches
which is nice I'm a huge fan of the too
much foundation
oh oh oh oh I knew this was coming
these are the new brow artist expert you
guys know that I'm a huge huge fan of
the L'Oreal Paris brow artist shape art
but this is the new one basically got
this angled end it's a twisty art and
down just like this and it has a spoolie
at the end that has been made I wear
which this is called cool brunette oh oh
so smooth so creamy you can like let you
do really light hair strokes as well
this is fully my color by magic and dark
brunette or warm brunette and I'm also
ever neat as well
look at this look at the chocolate mess
in the middle I can usually wear like 3
different colors from L'Oreal so I
really like that I don't know about the
true match foundation to me it's the
best on the high street for their
variation I think it's really really
good quality and big fan can we put
another anestachio box and it's a via I
love the way Anna's budges does the
Anastasio Anastasia Anastasia I'm sorry
right because that beautiful beautiful
deals ok how do I open it I've just had
a moment good thank you Jesus oh no no
no I'm so happy really appreciate that
because one of my favorite palettes is
actually the what the Maria Callas the
the
one what an earth is the other planet
called anyways right in my lovely friend
and start without my Luckies makeup she
is a makeup artist she borrowed it and
she still has it and I told her she can
have it it's fine
but yeah but I haven't been able scare
anyone yet but that is just going to
make my grey look at this let me swatch
a little I'm going to be a hundred
percent honest review some anastacio
formulas of the lip product I'm actually
allergic to I don't know which ones it
is sometimes it's usually if it's a
matte lip product there's something in
matte lip products that causes my lips
to kind of break out and then just be
really bad for like three weeks so I'm
really really careful and sometimes I
kind of fire die if it's a matte or
something because happen when I use
smashbox happens when i use a Nastasia
it didn't happen when i use two dot and
it didn't happen when i use top it's
hitting me okay these are glosses though
so we're okay I got those glasses okay
okay oh my gosh
just look at the cream look at the cream
look at the pigments that was amber this
is toffee just to just do a toffee
although I prefer amber hey let's try a
bevel it kind of like metallic a
metallic Brown Oh parfait parse a
beautiful name Peter ketchup on this I
know it's rude it's actually rude and
then this color here I'm just watching
with the foam height I neither saw stops
watching in different directions okay
well a Nastasia ever chewable hair
vitamins of I'll go just literally rip
these open and eat one right about now
so quick update actually requested these
from a company called hair that the
whole concept is just a multivitamin but
it contains a high amount of biotin and
some of the other victim ins are really
good for hair growth I'm all for taking
supplements I think it's a good idea but
when I bought
sugarbear hair and i guess obviously i'm
sponsored once and i was buying it as
well but you kind of have to pay quite a
lot of money I'm not gonna live it's a
cheaper and it's just as good the
reviews are really good so I'm going to
be taking these since I had that scalp
condition if you guys follow my blogs
you might know about it I just got one
big patch here is it great and I had I
cut my hair
so we will see I might share with you my
hair journey I don't know might be a bit
too embarrassed but I like taking
pictures and I am tracking also yes well
these are too tasty let me take it for
three months let's see if it accelerates
my hair growth this is what Estee Lauder
I love I love this body cream oh this is
a bit different okay
I'm feeling it giving me a bit more of a
mature life signing this is a perfume
never had a perfume from Estee Lauder
sweet Therese million Wow not a deep
dark smell but a sweet and fresh smells
that's what that smells like and love
this bronze goddess and body cream I've
used it many times all nauseous thank
you guys we have another shiny envelope
oh this is from Clinique Moisture Surge
hydrating supercharged concentrate wow
that looks like it's full of hydration
just look like it right now all I'm
seeing everywhere is hyaluronic active
everywhere and I bet that contains
hyaluronic acid if you are looking for
something that's going to give you
moisture from within high of hyaluronic
acid is the one what's in here
it's the USB so this is not only what
brands send if they want to give you
more information about a product so if
they don't wanna give you paper they'll
give you a USB stick and it will
probably have record little video all
about the Moisture Surge this is a
beauty blog Patricia please find a
parcel in clothes love look fantastic

the detox one if you have large pores or
like texturing your skin really really

this was in 2014 before anybody was
doing that kind of collaboration and
they were on it beforehand I was in it
