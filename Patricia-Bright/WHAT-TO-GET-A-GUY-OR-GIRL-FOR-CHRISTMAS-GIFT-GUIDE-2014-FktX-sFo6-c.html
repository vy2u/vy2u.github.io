today it is Michael hello Michael
coming onto my channel welcome you are
welcome to how'd you feel so excited to
be here today
oh my gosh it doesn't come on this
channel very regularly but so many
people have been asking about Christmas
gift guides yeah it is Christmas time as
you can see we're feeling very
Christmassy in here Michael
is wearing his Christmas Christmas
Christmas jumper and I've been waiting
to wear this oh yeah really has he
really
last year I never wore it so I don't
have one I just got one one it's all
good it's all good yeah today we wanted
to do a Christmas gift pie but I thought
that Michael would be a great person to
have and we basically got a load of item
that we want to share with you guys Oh
big thing as well by the way guys we are
gonna be doing a huge giveaway yes yeah
so loads of the items that we've got up
here are going to be given away and stay
watching to the end yeah yeah you're
doing it perfectly based a watching
right to the end guys and we're gonna
give you all the details of how you can
win some of these lovely items Christmas
yay in my flow sorry
first things first I'm gonna start off
with beauty products that I really
really like especially for the Christmas
season and I love receiving gifts as my
favorite place for the Christmas time
gift set has got to be body shop and the
body shop is amazing and just putting
gifts in the perfect packaging you can
get stuff for your mom you can get stuff
for your sister right now the two things
that I absolutely love from the body
shop are the sheer ultimate gift set and
I love Hsieh butter full stop anyway
I've actually got the collection myself
but I love this gift set number one
because it comes in a box and if you
know anything about me I love storing
boxes because you can actually have them
forever you know
you can never have enough boxes anywhere
even if you can't put anything in your
cupboards because your cupboards are
full of empty boxes boxes you never know
when a box is going to come in handy and
sure many of you will agree with me so
it comes in a really nice box but within
the box you get the the sheer body
butter you also get the body scrub and I
love love love a body scrub because it
makes me feel like I'm at a spa for me
this is just a really nice gift set to
receive from someone and baby if you've
got this something I'd be a very happy
woman and we can jump in the bath
together
infants hey hey after that my second
favorite set is the vanilla brulee I
think this is a new set I wasn't
entirely sure and it comes in a tin tins
are just as good as boxes to meet people
they're just as good as boxes it comes
in this gorgeous tin you can smell it
yeah it smells so so good
it's vanilla brulee it comes in the body
butter it comes with the vanilla brulee
shower gel the body polish and there's
also a sponge in there okay and for the
gents I've also got from the body shop
the modern gents fragrant kits inside
there is a hair and body wash here which
if you like me and you're a bit lazy and
you just like to use one product of
Michael dozen shampoo okay
he doesn't need shampoo he doesn't look
conditioner so this is good for him
there's also a white musk body spray in
there that smells amazing mm-hmm that
one don't you and the final thing is an
aftershave balm so if you're anything
like me and when you shave you sometimes
get like irritation and rough skin after
shaving something like that's gonna come
in handy your other options to get guys
are hand care kits I'm not very good
looking after my hands but I'm getting
better now due to requests from certain
somebody and they'll be like having
rough hands and sort of you know cry dry
custom crusty calloused hands after all
that heavy manual labor that we've been
doing so you can get a hand care kit
I've got two here these are the almond
ones from the body shop and the small
one which is like
a portable one can carry around with a
nice hand cream in or you can get
another one which comes in a nice metal
tin inside with all the things you
really need to look after your hand
there's a nice hand cream just for guys
it's for women is like a nice mess but
now another great thing I love about the
body shop is actually during the
Christmas they donate to charities this
year they are supporting War Child and
basically it is a charity that gives to
children's education in war-torn areas
so for special kits that are bought for
the Christmas season you are actually
giving back to children in these
situations and supporting their cartas
and for me I think that you know if I'm
gonna go and buy something it is really
nice to be able to give back so I'm
gonna link everything in the description
bar below so you can check those out
next I am moving on to makeup and I have
got the Charlotte Tilbury super model in
a box people this is maybe a product of
the year potentially even I know you
yeah you know about Charlotte Tilbury
Michael nevermind Charlotte Amarillo and
he always says it like I think he makes
it a mockery of me about how much I love
Charlotte Tilbury
but what I love is the fact that this is
called the supermodel in the box and for
guys who don't know what to get girls or
you don't really know you know how to
put a look together it does it for you
let alone that it has a video player on
the inside where it shows you how to
apply you get basically everything to
create the supermodel look so an
alternative beauty product I think our
makeup brushes I recently got into zoeva
I showed it in my last haul video but I
think for Christmas of the rose gold
options are amazing and this is like I
think it's like the basic brush it like
the basics that you need to start off
with and this isn't a gorgeous rose
guard as you can see they're not open
because the way you guys can win these
mm-hmm but you also get a makeup brush
case a gift option for guys men don't
really wear makeup and have so many
things at that but I've got here a beard
trimmer or beard
styling trimmer that you could get
beards and facial hair is really big at
the moment yeah Michael had a massive
ginger beer I did have it I was really
trying to grow it with it start to get
really kind of wild and unkempt and I
wish I'd just I don't know pruned it or
trimmed it or styled a bit but anyway
you can get something like this it's got
washable heads you can sort of trim and
shake your beard
look I'm going for it you can see how
you can't really tell if you can see it
on there but anyway yeah trimmer next is
obviously a classic to get people and
it's said that basically most of the
time that's what people get people at
Christmas yeah it's quite a common
present but I don't think you can never
go wrong with a goose well okay my
favorite at the moment is Tom Ford and
again it's another brand that I just
like that I like the aesthetic of it and
I mainly bought this because the bottle
looks amazing but I'm very excited that
it smells adjust as of good it's a
really nice velvet orchid I love the
dark bottle and it's just got a nice
warm smell which red makes you think of
Christmas so much I've got the girl in
Paris and scent here which was a
specially selected by sin somebody know
so good you know I think I always went
growing up I would used to get deodorant
to just quit I don't know if that's a
little bit kind of indicate you don't
keep keep yourself clean but yeah get
myself a nice scent a nice fragrance
especially for a guy you're gonna be
close and you know you smell good so
you'll never sort of be disappointed
with a good fragrance so our next guests
are kind of like electronic and techie
gifts but they're not too taking me it
is a power bank charger this product is
amazing blaze dies my phone dies all the
time like everyone oh surely always says
this is reset Patricia your phone is
always dying and it always dies they go
speak to your voice message more than
using exactly it's so annoying this here
is a portable charger now I had one that
you can put on your phone but you know
this is much much better one because
it's so slick in design but it's got a
mirror in it so it looks like an all
Beauty case oh I can just slip it in my
bag but you can charge for phones on
you can file charge iPhone you can
charge Samsung you can charge LG so I
think that for those of you who know
people who like you know what more than
a mirror for Christmas and maybe want a
portable practical charger like this
this is a really good option
there's nothing worse when you've been
out and about all day long and you
really need to use your phone but your
battery's dead on that red little sliver
and you're just stressed shit
so for a guy you could get them a good
quality pair of headphones I've got
these Bowers and Wilkins ones and
they've got absolutely fantastic sound
quality on them and another thing guys
don't end up as many accessories I don't
think most of the time but a good pair
of headphones well you know it's the
kind of thing that would last you've
used it for ages
on your mobile phone and you can speak
hands-free on it great nice little
leather design as well so yeah good pair
of headphones for a guy definitely a
good option now my next gift is because
I'm a sucker for infomercials I don't
like the worst one worse I sort kept
seeing this information emotions come on
I'm like no I like step away from the
television future but this is a good one
this I need okay so so there's this ad
from cuisine are and they've got the
soup maker I was like oh that looks like
a really nice fancy safe makeup you got
so now I have got a seat because I went
on the website and I saw that they had
really nice like blenders and all these
nice stuff but kitchen things and now
that I'm becoming a domestic goddess but
oh and then they had their you know
items of war items and it is the waffle
maker now sorry you guys have fought for
makers I've never had a waffle maker in
my life and this was a really nice
waffle maker and I think that anyone who
wanted to get a lady who was into
cooking or into baking and wanting to
try something different then I think a
waffle makers a really nice idea
my suggestion is the nutribullet if any
of you guys know me I have been
absolutely loving our nutribullet and
rinsing it day in and day out I was
really skeptical about getting it
initially but yeah it's grateful stop
making yourself healthy drinks juices
I'm really trying to get myself back
into shape you see how skinny
now ya know I'm trying to get myself
back in shape going to the gym take it
healthy snacks and having something like
this is really handy it's what these
nice lock containers you can put a lid
on if you want to add protein or sort of
supplements and stuff to it you can
so my next thing that I think is really
cool is the LG pocket
photo now for those of you who live that
selfie life like a lot of us do and I
think it's just super cool you're able
to print the images that you have on
your phone on the spot you like printing
paper and you can connect this to your
phone kind of those old-school Polaroids
yeah and I think it's just so so cool
and I think that sometimes there are
photos and moments you just want to
physically keep and like keep looking it
on one Taj wall if you know a girl who
likes really like taking loads of photos
or you have loads of photos of her on
your phone and you want to send her all
the printed versions I think that this
is absolutely amazing you can use it on
absolutely any phone as well obviously
it's from LG they're the ones who have
created it but you can definitely use it
on anything my next suggestion is
something like a Nike FuelBand which
I've got here this is a great present I
think for somebody who's kind of into
exercise or fitness that you are right
now yeah yeah but basically it's just a
nice way if you're on a sort of to
health or fitness journey or you're
trying to get into something like that
and you want to be able to kind of set
goals or targets or track how you're
getting on you can check your steps or
your exercise or calorie consumption
thinking with your phone computer stuff
like that it's really efficient option
the next suggestion which are kind of
focus him and her they like the same
thing but I think that Diaries are a
really good idea
Michael's laughing like he doesn't know
I do I do like a part of me feels like
this is like a bit of an old-school
granddad type of type suggestions mate
but it's actually in practical terms my
dad is like my my baby okay I think a
nice diary is always a good option this
one is from not--let's
and I love a week to view week to views
this is corny gotta be able to see what
you're doing
I manage my entire week right and that's
when we sit down and we get our Diaries
together we have a little chitchat about
what we're planning on doing and then I
would also like to have you know pages
at the back to write my notes and stuff
yeah a similar option to that is cement
of Filofax which i think is a bit of
throwback out there Firefox has been
around for ages this is a bit like a
diary but you can talk I don't know you
can take things out but I could ring
binder in there as well just a handy lot
of things to carry around with you also
wanted to recommend some cookbooks the
first book I wanted to recommend it was
the Great British Bake Off Christmas
edition everybody at my work talks about
yeah yeah yeah Great British Bake Off it
is famous and I think during the
Christmas time it is really nice to look
at like baking ideas and I think anyone
would appreciate that if you are someone
who's really into cooking and stuff then
getting these so my Egyptian Pro
cookbook is yota mottling is plenty more
this book has got loads of vegetable
based dishes which is great if like me
of trying to be a bit more healthy and
kind of switch up your diet a little bit
but there's loads of cookbooks out there
that are gonna be a good idea I've
really been getting into cooking
recently which is kind of a new thing
for me yeah and I know you've been
appreciating it and it's common things
where when you get into it I've been
really enjoying it's good to have ideas
and kind of new things to make and when
you can make a dish for someone right
sounds weird when you can make a dish
and kind of give it to someone that
you've made it's just like I don't know
I've been really enjoying that so guys
