you doing I'm not talking to you I'm
talking to my camera so that weird
Maxon is just gonna stop hello good one
but don't do that creepy stop please not
on camera
good bye ready this is my first vlog of
the year and Michael really wants to get
involved so I'm just gonna cut them out
now and it's just me you what a time to
be alive
Will Smith is vlogging welcome to 2080
this is my basically my monthly vlog so
today I've got a really big shirt I'm
really excited because my look can be
very different so yeah I came to regular
box this is first one let's do this I'm
trying to be good when it comes to my
health and fitness I should get a little
bit of that trust me it is really harder
to just stay snatched and you know I'm
not gonna lie now I'm in this space and
I take pictures regularly and I will not
say that I'm not self-conscious about
the way I look I am sometimes it just
doesn't hold me back like okay right now
I look like I've got a beer belly oh
well it you know it oh well I'm doing
the whole ketogenic diet um I was so far
so good I've really liked it and then
I've been trying to work out a little
bit more again I'm finding that really
good but I'm so excited to just get on
it I'm even taking like you know my
multivitamins and I detest swallowing
pills secondly is well for 2018 I am
doing something I'm so excited about
well there's lots of things but this is
one I want to show you now I'm going to
be developing a course for women who
want to be bosses in business base
and the reason being is that you know I
don't talk about it as much on my
channel anymore just because I actually
am over worker than a talker and about
what I do so you know I have my own
business I'm doing relatively well and I
wanted to do something that could help
women just give them the fundamental
steps of developing your own business
how to do it because a lot of times a
lot of people don't want to share that
information and for those who know me in
real life and I hope that some people
who know me will speak up I'm a sharer I
share everything I'll tell you exactly
how to do it I'll write you a roadmap
and so I wanted to take what I love
doing I love sharing information because
I'm always like we can all be great
together I was I had I make a course out
of this and give it to loads of people
not just people who I know or people who
are already in the industry what about
people who want to develop their own
digital business is social media
businesses and yeah it's not gonna be
ready until probably April and but it's
like it's like my challenge that I've
given myself for 2018 it's like my
biggest the biggest thing I'm creating
and I'm putting all my heart and soul
into it while doing everything else I
just can't wait right I'm gonna hurry up
and get ready I have a shoot today we've
got a magazine so let's go
just get in shoot many macomb at all
right yes maybe just had a baby three
weeks yes and I have to come off a
butcher shop and you can make me do this
I love it thank you got any hair as well
we're gonna have a big protest look but
do something different so first look
it's a bit big so yeah we're going big
or go home
behavior

met Emanuel before I don't know but
because I don't see you so they're not
going to see you Emanuel yes

of the year and it's only 10 yummy

face wearing earrings your door has been
slow and steady getting back into

some kind of GI Joe lot going on I have
to show you these shoes these are little
Balenciaga is that go all the way up to
my side you can even see that there
anyway irrelevant it is time for dinner
good morning I can't remember why I left
off last night I think we had dinner
good morning from China the view is
amazing
check out the view so sick so ridiculous
this was a surreal to be here I'm very
excited just been to the gym I'm feeling
very weird because like I've woken up at
the time that I wouldn't normally go to
bed so I don't know how I'm gonna handle
the day I've got these goodies in from
Dior we're going to be doing some Tai
Chi so this is my like outfit we're
going to a tea ceremony ki imagine
Patricia Lee going to a tea ceremony
it's a hundred percent me didn't know
there was tea ceremonies but now that I
do it might be a way of life I've
decided to run myself a bar how nice is
this bar size and then look there are
bath salts here bath salts yes
we are off to go I'm never going for a
traditional tea tasting ceremony yeah oh
good you're like literally lit from
within right now it feels very surreal
to be here very thorough
the leaf just finish our tea ceremony
and Taichi
I'm feeling very ready to start the day
I mean is like so
today but it was a very good morning
going out to dinner this evening sunny
sitting in my room I'd know if you were
going to do anything but go to a bar but
like a premier bar in Shanghai so I got
this pantsuit on like off-the-shoulder
feeling really cute I haven't had much
of a chance to sit down and chat what I
try and do that later on
okay there's a straw coming out of the
dump later so yeah that's why I'm gonna
try
no justice how are you I feel like I've
not had a moment to even sit down and
speak to you on camera Shanghai has been
a bit full well when it's been amazing
obviously I'm here with Dior and it's
just a press trip which has been so good
like the team have been absolutely
amazing as you can tell I'm exhausted
I keep basically dropping off and just
having naps and then sleeping till 11
o'clock and it's been kind of intense
hold on I want to really show you the
product look at the goodies that I've
got so these are the new youth capture
products they really want you guys to
kind of know what I'm here what I'm
looking at and I've been using the lifts
copter at night because boy do I feel
like I need to keep my jowls in place
and so far so good I feel like I've got
to do a full-blown nighttime routine
video for you so you can actually see
why hat we do but you know my skincare
series today is kind of a chill day I'm
going to probably go for lunch with
Akash he's from oh it's amazing building
my eyes have just caught it look at this
can you see that this is amazing so
today I'm hoping and actually going to
go get some Chinese food and then I'm
also going to Canada
so yeah this week is gonna be quite an
intense week of January but I'm down I'm
feeling it I'm happy I'm confident I can
do this
and in this one think that's very
tiffany blue right now and I just drank
my water which I had a really big thing
there when you okay so we've just
finished this is a catch by the way guy
he works at the Albany seriously like an
instagramer and stuff and he really got
on on this trip we just had lunch but
we're going to the deal offices now yeah
which I'm super excited about I'm
crashing I wasn't meant to be coming but
hey here we go just to get a taxi
yeah then yeah yeah honestly they just
like human like they had green lights on
and everything and they just it was the
blank stare
one guy virtually accelerated faster
even though he was part unique I feel
like I'm touching the ground
I feel really low you know we're in the
car on the way yeah
and they're like nope nope yeah just
gonna walk through Shanghai and just use
my google map so like walk me back to
the hotel in these high heels over no
taxi stopping for me actually been a bit
of a blessing because I've been able to
walk and might enjoy and see couple of
things I've installed a couple of purses
or they've attempted to sell me a couple
of passes of which I've been like now
I'm alright for a foley Vuitton purse
for the moment this is all good
the breeze is in my it's feeling good
feeling good all the way back was really
nice already in my car it was ready and
way for me to go to the airport

Oh Canada
listen went out last night I called
tried to devastate me
I thought I confirmed me I said I know
how to handle cold I've got a pipeline I
think within about eight seconds I went
mmm maybe I should have rethought my
decision-making process to leave the
hotel it's cold
I've got but the views cute it's like
snowy and white and I see everywhere and
I don't know why it looks blue but there

Cosmetics we've got something very
special brewing I don't know if I can

lipstick coming out with Mac it's insane

this is and last night I woke up to 2
million followers like it's all been
very it's open for me in life I'm gonna
need to sit down and have like a little
gratitude chat because it's really hard
for me to take it in because I don't
really like I don't know I can't explain
it but I'm so grateful and it's just
it's just mad it's just mad but yeah I'm
here with Mac and look I've got my lab
coat I've got this planet own book yeah

done it to me but it's necessary because
