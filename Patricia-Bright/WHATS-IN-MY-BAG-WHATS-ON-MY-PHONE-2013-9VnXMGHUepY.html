to a YouTube classic which is going to
be what's in my bag and I've just added
a bit of modern-day technology and I'm
going to do what's on my mobile phone as
well couple more details on my bag
because lots of people have asked here
is a good view of it and it's a
Chanel and bag and it's in the newer
style flap which is I think it's only a
seasonal style bag but it's in the
lambskin and this is in a large slice
have a lot more details of it on my blog
if you check out my blog moment of
Starcom it has the vintage Chanel clasp
all you do is push that down and it
opens up and it's very very nice and
that's what the inside looks like and
it's got a lovely kind of aubergine oops
leather interior and the chain is a gold
chain and it's in a loop style and they
have these really cool little and
crosses on them that you'd never be able
to see like from far away but up close
you get to see that detail and at the
back and this is how the chain is
attached so let's move on to what's
inside this lovely bag so first things
first is my hand cream I can get quite
ashy and I hate it when you know that
bit there what's that bit called that
bit when it gets a bit crusty no you
never want that so I always carry hand
cream with me because my hands can get
very dry and this is from Neutrogena and
I'm sorry if I sound really weird I have
a bit of a cold you know and sticking
with and not wanting to be a she is I
always carry a little lip balm on me
especially for my like lipstick wears
off I kind of rebar and then real
lipstick and this I bought in the US and
it's year so it's a sheer butter one and
it's really really really good I'm very
glad I have this now to be honest with
you I usually carry about two or three
lipsticks because I always feel that it
doesn't matter what the rest of your
face looks like but if your lips don't
aren't like bright or shiny or if they
just look ashy that's what's really
gonna make your face not look as best as
it could so I always carry around my Mac
lip gloss which is what I'm
and it's called driven by love and oh
this is a color here called sangria a
pill by by Terry and it's kind of like a
a dark red but it's like a yeah very
dark red but it's very lovely very
moisturizing and it just always pulls my
face up so next I always carry a wallet
with me and this is my Michael Kors
wallet I think I got this last year now
flicker got this for my birthday for my
husband but all it contains is a little
bit of cash I try to carry like at least
the fiber with me all the time and my
debit card
that's all it contains in there actually
but if I don't want to carry like a
massive wallet like that with me I have
a little pouch which she was actually a
it's by bagger and it was in my Birchbox
selection I think in September and it
was amazing it's the most beautiful real
leather pouch that I literally just put
some money in it and I also put my keys
in there to avoid scratching the inside
of my bag I always have headphones in my
bag oh yeah these look crazy but
basically if I wanted to listen to music
on the train or something I'm not going
to be one of those people who play my
stuff on loudspeaker but yeah I always
always have these in my bag and I get
very upset if I don't have them in there
I do carry a little brush like this
little comb like this the tibialis it's
not really good to get through much but
if you know these naps right here are
getting a bit coarse or this bits a bit
crazy then I just carry this coat with
me and I probably need a smaller one but
because it's nice and flat it just does
the trick anyway and I have this really
cool mirror
it's a bimodal mirror while I think it's
Union Jack on the outside like that but
Helmer OHE I don't know if you can see
but it actually lights up lights off
that's on and it's really it's a really
good light mirror like if you will have
it look at me finally if I am getting a
bit oily I just carry around a
mineralized skinfinish with me because
this will give me a light coverage
without me looking
sometimes people do their makeup on the
go and then they end up putting way too
much on and just looking crazy so this
is light enough that you know I can just
touch up and look decent and I have a
little Real Techniques brush but I just
carry it along in my bag would be so
moving on to my mobile phone
as mentioned previously this case gets
an absolute lot of love but I only
bought it on the eBay for like 239 I
will link it in the description bar and
I loved it because it was like that case
for worst case what was the case from oh
that looks dangerous I know Roy I always
say the same joke its plastic like I
always do that because sometimes you put
the guilt it's a bit like a knuckle
duster but I find that it's just a great
way to kind of hold your phone
especially when taking selfies and it's
just kind of cool so let's move on to my
phone and the apps that I have on my
phone so you guys should definitely
check out the o2 TV channel on YouTube
I'll link it in the description box and
I actually did a day out doing a
shopping competition with some bloggers
and this guy who we had like a major
competition but he used some sneaky apps
and I use couple of apps that I had on
my iPhone to basically do the style
competition and actually ended up
winning in the end hey-oh
so yeah I'll link that below but one of
the style apps that I have on here is
the Zara app so the Zara app is
absolutely amazing you're able to shop
the stuff that I would store and it can
also tell you what store is nearest that
has the item in stock amazing I love
this app so next is Instagram you all
probably have Instagram and it's nothing
new but the key other apps around
Instagram I really like are things like
pic fix I use pic fits I use photo
Wonder and I use milligram these are
three different apps that basically
allow you to refill to your images and
your pictures and one I like pic fix
because it has amazing like lights and
other features and lens flares that you
can add and I like photo wonder because
that's what I used to make my collar
and milligram because it allows you to
mirror your images so I always have to
Patricia's in one photo so I also got
the blog loving app that I have on my
phone because it means that I can follow
and read all my favorite blogs on the go
and see who's posted something new and
to be totally honest of you I'm not a
game player I never played any games
like temple one or anything like that
but I'll read blogs again I just
mentioned that I love reading and I love
reading things that kind of inspire and
encourage and entrepreneur is a really
really amazing app as well which has
articles and reading and I just love
reading it you know it kind of gives me
inspiration and it gives me motivation
and I always show it's really important
to fill yourself with stuff that to you
this is taking away for those of you who
use whatsapp whatsapp is my favorite and
app as well because I get to keep in
touch with my lovely people I've got
rayon here me and Ray always talk on
whatsapp I've got Mike I've got the
girls and lots of other people and it's
just a way to incident it's instant
messaging basically kind of like bbm but
not bbm and I've also got the eye hop
Casey and I love it they have like live
sessions are going on throughout the
night and there's teachings and words
and worship and things that I I do to
relax oh right and then play a game I
will listen to a sermon but I know it
sounds weird but that will relax me that
makes me feel good or I'll listen to
some worship music that just keeps me
really nice and peaceful
and finally that app that I do have as
well is the bit strip app which is quite
fun you know it's a bit of fun there so
yeah I do have some fun things I have
designed an avatar look I've put it out
