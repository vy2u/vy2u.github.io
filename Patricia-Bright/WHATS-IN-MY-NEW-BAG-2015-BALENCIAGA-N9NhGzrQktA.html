have a what's in my bag video
honestly I've not had a what's in my bag
video for three years I literally had
one just after I got married I might
have had another one since I don't know
but I've been married for three years
now hey hey anniversary just came up hey
hey hey
but yeah I was like you know what I want
to do what's in my bag I have a new bag
okay which is one of the reasons
obviously what I'm doing this you can
see that I'm very very happy it is a
designer bag is a spring kind of colored
bag and I basically buy a designer bag
only once a year I do a lot of saving I
saved up a lot for this bag it is the
Balenciaga lydic scott ball leather bag
and this color is like a khaki color I
have been saving and I've worked a long
time and I really do put thought into
when I buy a designer bag but I really
wanted to get myself a really spring and
fun bag and I've really been liking
Balenciaga I think it's a really chic
brand and I love bags that are really
understated it's got gold gold and
silver hardware and it's also got gold
and silver hardware at the top and then
it can also be worn as a strappy bag as
well so I love it and I wanted a nice
springtime bag anyway let's go inside my
bag and see what we have in it and
obviously my bag is never normally this
neat this is a new bag and I moved
everything over the neatest way possible
okay now this is how I wish my bag was
all the time
I wish okay number one I have a diary it
says with freedombox flowers and the
moon who could not be happy and this is
actually just a Kate Spade kind of diary
notepad now the reason I carry a notepad
is that I am someone who can get a
nitwit stressed out if you guys don't
know I have a lot of thoughts in my head
like I'm always thinking and so I found
that having a diary or a pen and paper
always to hand means that I'm always
able to kind of write stuff down and I
literally travel on the train all the
time and I'm always always writing stuff
down
have one of these Rolly pencils and the
reason I have a pencil because I'm
always scared about losing my pen nibs
and they always end up drawing on the
inside of my bag so I hate that so this
is one of those like Swiss cheese swishy
whatever it just breaks off and I love
them I feel that my writing looks extra
pretty when I have a pencil like this so
after that I have my wallet now because
this is a smaller bag I have a much
bigger Michael cause wallet that I put
my bigger bag but for a smaller bag I
just have this little card case and it
is a Liberty of London car case I think
I got this free I think I got this free
from somewhere and I basically have my
debit card I also have my driving
license my folder you guys don't need to
see my name but I've got my driving
license my pictures actually pretty I
remember that that day Esther did my
makeup and I thought oh let's go take a
picture and I look really nice on that
day and inside it I also have it is
purities I have allergies and sometimes
all of a sudden I might go somewhere I'd
be like I'm allergic to something in the
air and I can feel like the back of my
throat itch in or my ship they always
have an allergy tablets with me because
I don't know why I'm like hitch in that
film and then he just passed up like
that fence to me and my Waitrose card
now if you are from the UK you need to
get yourself a Waitrose card the reason
being is obviously you get points when
you shop but every time you go in you
can get a free tea or coffee with your
Waitrose card so I would definitely
advise anyone and everyone to do that if
you like fruit tea and coffee I also
have a perfume this is the Tom Ford
Mandarin D Amalfi it's only really small
one it's 13 millimeters which is why it
is in my bag this is the most gorgeous
like oh it smells so like fresh it's
just got a really fresh floral smell and
I don't usually like like smells good
it's just got just the freshness and I
don't usually like fresh smells I
usually like quite sweet smells but this
is delicious like it smells so so so
good and the bottle er is so pretty is
this
not like the most gorgeous bottle ever
like yes so after that I have my phone
charger extra charger thing here it's a
bit crusty sorry guys and to be honest I
really raved about this over the
Christmas time it's not the best it has
so many little loose bits that like end
up falling and flying out that's a
little bit annoying but it does have a
good mirror in it which is great because
I don't have a makeup bag in here
because it is a smaller bag and I
basically just plug this into my phone
or into my laptop and it basically keeps
it charged when my battery is running
down but the worst thing is you have to
remember to charge this thing if you
don't you have two dead batteries in
your bag and that has happened to me so
many times and it gets so so so annoying
after that I have some hand cream I
always have a Sheehan's you can probably
tell now you'll probably Patricia your
hands already ashy I don't know why my
hands are just they've I've worked hard
I was worked hard as a child and that is
why I have tough hands that this is from
hotel chocolate and it's the tea Jardine
conditioning body butter with cocoa
butter and argan oil I just have to have
a hand cream in my bag to help me during
those times where my hands might just be
crushed in you know after that I have my
iPhone 6 in my bag I literally have only
just got this but to be honest I don't
really like the iPhone 6 that much if
I'd be really really honest with you I
find it a little bit slippery and a bit
annoying and stuff like that but and the
camera quality is really good they also
like to carry a little comb with me
because this is a smaller bag this isn't
a full sized bag so I don't have a brush
but I just have like this mini comb I
don't even know where this is from I
think it's from the pharmacy and it's
just like when my hair is looking a
little bit peppercorn II and I just
scrape out this peppercorns and just
neaten up my hair as well majority of
what's left in my bag is actually lip
product because I basically hold on let
me just organize if there's so many lip
product it's crazy basically I'm not
fast about reapplying makeup when I go
out and but I'm always gonna reapply any
lips
Cornie lip balm because the worst thing
you can have is a she'd lips when you're
out in public so I have the Giorgio
Armani it is the lip tip this is a color
500 this is in my everyday makeup look I
love this love love love is but it does
need a lip liner I'm gonna link that
video so you can look at my like
everyday face kind of look my Kiko lip
liner in five one five I always put
these two together a lot of the times I
wear hats out and sunglasses because I
think I'm Angelina Jolie not because a
lot of the time I just haven't put any
makeup on and I always always get seen
by you guys I feel like I scare you you
like pictures I'm like yeah yeah it's me
I'm sorry I know crazy right now I've
got no makeup on I'm always giving some
excuses I always wear like glasses and
like do my lips and like maybe my brows
so I always have these two as a
combination we also have the Urban Decay
lip glosses this is a color called beso
I've had these for ages but they're
really really nice to just fling on
naturally you don't need a NIC liner on
anything and that's why this is always
in my bag after that I also have plum
full from Mac I love to go for strong
dark colors because they do make you
look quite vibrant but I'm plan for is a
really nice natural purpley color from
Mac that I like to wear all the time and
I also have a mini lipstick from
Charlotte Tilbury this color is called
Penelope pink and it's really really
nice nude I have three different ones of
these I've got those over the Christmas
time and finally I've got the most
humanoid set of keys in here as well but
basically my trick is to put all my keys
in one location because I found that I
kept losing my keys because I used to
like my little house keys and had a
little car key whatever
I just put every key on here I've got my
little Mercedes key ring on there home
keys and I also have my weight right
like this is I important getting my free
tea and coffee is to me have a mini
Waitrose card and just in case I don't
have my witches card with me car keys
and then I have this little aspinall
keyring thingamabob here I don't know
it's just another thing to have on
peas and I find the video kilo the less
likely you are to lose them I don't know
why but it's really really worked for me
by putting every key into like one big
branch there so guys basically that is
my bag it is fully empty now now it's
not the biggest bag it's more like a
mini bag as you can see there but I
really do quite like the thought of not
having to carry so much around with me
and if I'm good I should be able to
carry a little bag like this around with
me all the time so guys I just wanted to
mention if you didn't watch my last
video or a few of my last videos I
mentioned the fact that I worked with
the charity Childline on a campaign
called FA PZ fats which is all about
porn and how it can impact children and
young people and how it can affect their
lives and relationships they basically
have a set of cartoons
I actually voice one of the characters
in the cartoons and it was a really cool
and interesting day and I just think
it's a really important thing to kind of
educate young people on this kind of
stuff so I would definitely recommend
that you guys check it out I will link
it in the description bar below also if
you yourself are young person and it
might be something you want to share
with a young person you might know then
definitely do it's a really fun really
cool really alternative set of cartoons
that tackles a real issue so make sure
you guys check that out but that is
today's video done what's in my bag it's
been a long time I hoped you enjoyed and
I will catch you guys later thank you
for watching bye so guys today we are
going to slow it down and I'm going to
share the my relaxing evening routine
lots of you asked about this so I hope
you enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
