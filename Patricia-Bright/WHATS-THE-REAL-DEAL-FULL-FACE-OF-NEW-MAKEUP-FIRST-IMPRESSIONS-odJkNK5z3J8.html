it
Wow hi guys welcome to my channel
we got a new read people we got a new
weave I feel like my edges needed and
the old time to breathe
there's my edges are coming up there we
need to move into the textured
Department because my edges are not
smooth and silky but with a little bit
of Gorillaz lot and you know what
they're kind of not looking too much
like pepper bond which is my permanent
issue but it's go good I don't know what
you guys think of me the textured hair I
will just like I look very young when I
wear textured hair but now that lip SETI
I don't know that's a bad thing you know
it's alright it's good you know
I see me I don't have a problem with
that everything yeah I'm going to do a
full face of new in a product eval kind
of products that I have recently got new
in some I have use of it so mad at you
if you guys watched my unboxing video
then it's some product from there as
well so I got a bunch of new things I'm
going to do my space you've got some Kat
Von D it got some tasks so there's a -
Talia we got some L'Oreal Paris
you got some hood up these are bit of
everything and I'm going to do this tour
except I'm going to chat ok so first
things first and I'm going to call this
new it is new it's a brow artist expert
from lawyer Paris you guys know I always
use the brow artist shaper so it is in
like new new new to me but I'm I love a
rolly eyebrow pencil and I'm actually
using the color enemy now I'd really
like to call it every knee what I really
like about this brow pencil is that it's
just quick and it's just easy it's got
the spoolie and the way this thing is
set up right now
means that you're going to get really
good application
Jona think this will be lovely just
browse and then nothing out looks like a
little bit of concealer
although the dark circles are a real
ting so I'm not sure if that's a reality
to me whereas up now but yeah that's why
concealers amazing I am going to use the
new Tarte clay stick and if you watch my
unboxing I'm a bit confused as to what
this whether this is a concealer is
their foundation what is it like I
wasn't really sure however I have used
it a few times and I do like it as a
concealer so I must accept it as a
concealer plus the way the shades are
working right about now really the
darkest and Asian shade I can't really
do it's a bit red I've got it here for
me although it comes to the suckit it's
kind of right but it's a bit too red for
me so I'm going to sit in for others but
I don't know but this color here is key
see it's more yellow even though the
lighter shade but it's a more yellow
shade and I feel like for me my skin is
a bit better of the yellow so I'm going
to just go in with this and I think the
biggest thing when it comes to me trying
new makeup is shave like it isn't a joke
there's so many different nuances to I
think with this all skin tones but I
feel like with dark skin tone and with a
more cool with war-worn and will paint
them all yellow and more red we're more
like is different and you just need that
variety you know but I'm going in with
the clay stick and this color is called
tan deep honey and I'm just need my
anger washed and with a cinema brown
now actually looking at that from
eyebrows I actually find that to be a
bit too cool I'm just going to mix these
two together
you know what I'm going to give it
another chance the other color because
it isn't awful and I actually think for
my brows it's actually better than the
shade that I was just resting
okay so next I'm using the Kat Von D
locate foundation the color I'm using is
deep warm 74 now the thing is the color
numbering is a little bit all cozy warm
76 and there's also deep neutral 78 but
they're not necessarily lot up like your
darker they're just different element
which is a plus but for me this shade
this very foundation was attached to
light for me as i'm swatching it but I
don't care I'm just going to quote my
body shop shade adjusting drops in them
and I actually just made foundations a
little bit darker but the consistency or
next foundation has got me too excited
to not try it try me
now this foundation is full full full
coverage Wow like you guys can't see
this I don't know how much you can see
right but I'm telling you this look
almost look like a moss I can't believe
it's this matte as well very matte it's
not I don't even feel like it - to life
this is not great I'm impressed by that
coverage and how it looks in person okay
okay let's go and conceal I'm using the
top plate stick sander and I asked you
know I'm going to keep going on but I
like how like
without looking drive that mechanism and
i'm going to go back in with the clay
stick and i'm going to use the tan d
honey to highlight just add one more of
the other color just to add a little bit
of warmth to it and this is really
creamy and really smooth and under my
eyes at the moment has been so eager i I
don't know what's going on I think I'm
just a dry person but my skin is
sometimes oily and sometimes I get xml
my like i leave them on to my eyes i
come and just need to take a leak off
for makeup i think i'm going to do that
when i go away I love this clip stick I
think it's really really good and the
fact that it's got no Nazis in it I'm
feeling that the contour I'm just going
to go in with my normal this is my map
Diane K this is called a quick trick
stick really good next I'm going in with
a 2 WT textured shadows palette this is
kind of new not new it's new to me
because I didn't have it in my
collection this is like no I'm just
going to buy it because I've seen it a
lot love the colors in it and I just
wanted to I wanted to try it I wanted to
be in with the in crowd
okay okay then here it is and the colors
are all me like fully or me I'm going to
go in with man-eater actually do you
know what I'm not going to go over many
- I'm going to go in with henna sure is
red that's sure regret well I do not can
we talk about how pretty this palette is
for a minute and I love these textured
shadows up here I think that's so cool
you guys know me and I'm a simple girl
and a gomez today that's a really wife
but I didn't even put the paper on
underneath my eyes for the win yeah I
definitely think that this is a very
pigmented palette and usually what comes
of the same dark skin I would have to
put like a paper on as a base like the
paper placed on to really get the color
to pop in
show but for me this is shown way more
than it normally would Cal Cal we've
been trying to do a traumatic I look
chemical lock is quite dramatic what
you're trying to put my phone with
another cert no not to mark and then
there's this color vehicle 24k I'm going
to go in and I'm going to just put that
in my inner tear duct that is so pretty
I love it love it
I'm going to go in with my mascara I'm
still using the false lash you start x-5
up or Molly out if this isn't one of the
best mascaras of all time I'm a liar
because this is so good and I'm just
going to set my under eyes in my Sascha
which is actually at the end to the new
I have never finished the powder before
my life but this one finished I'm going
to pop on my lashes these are the Gisele
from blue the beauty okay so next I'm
going to use that anastasiya or palette
this is new ish but I use it as soon as
I see because I thought it was gorgeous
and I feel like people are always asking
me what I'm using and it is good and the
color that I'm using is called spectra
it's like this shiny purple and I know
someone who's ever kind of where they're
you know I have a tried to ride in yet
but look at this right one I use that
brush look at this this to me is so
beautiful
every time I wear it someone's like what
highlight are you wearing that looks
awesome and it's this I just think it's
ridiculous I think it's beautiful and
the little goes a long long way
okay so next I'm going to use this from
the skin illuminator it is from Tom Ford
they did send this to me I didn't buy it
and but I had one that I had I bought a
maybe like two years ago and I loved it
maybe I'm just going to
on top of my highlight there it's more
of a creamy highlight and then it is for
so many words a bit more than a natural
highlight look quite a wet product okay
but I also received this in my PR this
is also from Tom Ford
this looks so stunning the packaging is
to Johnny like this is the packaging big
mirror like what am i expensive yes I
yeah oh my gosh I love it I'm just going
to put this bright pink and bright pink
is actually so much so much I just went
on and that is gorgeous
yeah for you pink could go pretty in
pink the soft soft feminine is beautiful
wonder what this colors like actually I
call it a really nice bumper to be on
this issue but I can sweep honor to pass
on it quite nice mmm okay so some of you
might have seen that I receive this
absolutely epic
lip gloss kit from a moscovia I am going
to go in and use one but go as amber and
then I've got there was one person it
I'm going to go in I actually just put
them on but it was a little like I'm
going to go in with my bittersweet Lima
I'm going to go in with amber which is
really creamy and it's really pigmented
I feel like a little goes a long way
that is so so look at when I say so so
so it's so pretty my lips look luscious
okay so we do that in the mirror you're
feeling ago very much now I'm going to
go with rum I'm a darker lip clip I
don't need line as much
so it's really creamy and like really
nourishing you guys are not acting very
rarely wear darker colors like this
I'm not even magic is my gosh I feel
like I might layer it with another color
for in here this is critical pave looks
really good
okay guys so overall that is my school
face of a new and makeup I like it I
feel like this most makeup you can work
it the real question is how does it
laughs this is the first time I've tried
the market foundation so I mean you know
how it goes and going out all day today
so I might just like check back in and
show you I look like this highlight I
love it and the eyes as well like
obvious I said pigmented I'm really glad
that I've got this palette I've been
wanting to try it I think it's expensive
Simeone fizzes and it's similar to
Marcel VI one but I mean if you love
youí I think it's one that you've got
to have eyebrow pencil love it yeah and
it's me and dark really as well Wow

glossy and creamy that's what I like and
super super light pigmented as well like
