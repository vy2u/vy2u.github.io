easier then somebody was in charge of
pressing record and she forgot to press

we more potatoes tastes like crap you

you're getting very awkward Michael so
guys I think that is it from us that was
actually just a little bit of fun
Kanye's for playing in the background
they're just another fun but kind of
bored I wanted you to do a midweek video
hopefully I edit this and get this out
to you guys our people did have a cubed
a to ask on
let's do this real quickly what's the
most embarrassing thing one of you did
in public that's a good one there's many
I know my most embarrassing thing yet
marker does embarrassing things
constantly I don't think they're
embarrassing noticing at normal yeah
that's because you have literal know you
get Tina gets embarrassed by me
literally every day but I'm a very
embarrassed person however I happen to
be myself and what know when well not
that happened in public but when I went
to the village
when I first attended the video you a
baby no I was like 14 okay so that's not
a baby and the toilet was outside and I
did I was not used to using outside
bathrooms and I really needed to do a
number two and I didn't want to do a
number two until we could get to the
hotel so I could do a number two and so
I did a number two in a plastic bag and
my mum told everyone and everyone knew
that I did a permanent blasted bags
embarrassed how did they say did you poo
oh she didn't have to tie legs she
was d-bag my mother's no cheese she just
told everyone
oh she had to use the bag yeah but know
about you very quickly we're taking it
okay most embarrassing but I think thing
I did when I used to work as a waiter
and we were really short staffed I was
rushing around and I had a bowl of hot
soup in my hand and I poured it all over
a woman completely by accident but she
had like a really fancy dress on in a
posh restaurant somewhere and I must
have completely ruined a night and I
poured tomato soup all over a hair and
and I bet you tried to desperately wipe
it down around I'll just put the flat
and I don't know what it's like when you
try to brush my hair it's itchy like
tearing right so up it someone said have
you afford our holidays we've actually
been invited out to this holiday and by
ComEd hotels which is absolutely amazing
however we work a lot we saved a lot and
I think travelling is all about money on
is our vice that's where we spend our
money we're too young people with no
responsibilities no no no dependent
really no children as such I have a
house you know people who some people
spend their money on other stuff we
speak
Johnson rock community rock roll we just
spend on travelling so easy
all these snapchat questions are good
thanks guys if you're not following me
on snapchat is the Patricia bright and
you advice for anyone starting YouTube
do you I think though the question you
ask yourself is why I think nowadays a
lot of people start YouTube to be famous
to be famous or to start a business or
something or to make money where you
have to realize that the gut me starting
out on YouTube I started when there
wasn't a single penny I did it for four
years at all three years without making
a penny I did it while I was at
university I did it while I was at work
I would come home every night and edit
that enjoyed it so ask yourself why you
want to start YouTube because there was
no fame when I started YouTube and like
even like blogs and stuff like that for
us it was we do our vlogs for fun
in fact we actually get as much fun
watching them back wait exactly our
blogs are very much self indulgent which
is why they're not always the most
entertaining because we put things in
there that we enjoy watching so why are
you doing it like make sure you start
YouTube for the right reasons where do
you and Michael see yourself in one
three and five years I like that
question in one year probably doing a
little bit more travel and love
conversion in the house Nigeria F&amp;amp;E
wanna see in the family seeing our
sisters more three years definitely with
two kitty win cause little patrie oh my
kitty Winkle in three years babe how
many how why do you think I'm gonna have
babies one a year one two three oh oh
how do I get my buddy back you just like
work train at the same time no you can't
train me apparently
Pilates look at this guy here hydro 30
days hydrotherapy five years I see
myself sisters legs head bombs and tums
Wow five years I see myself with three
kids in a nice beautiful house in the
cellar years more travel more love more
passion and well possibly moving out to
Vegas and just living that rock oh you
owe me how is the weather where we are
right now it is gorgeous it is basically
seven o'clock at night like literally
it's so hot in the day you just can't do
anything and so we like hanging you
everything I don't say it like you've
been dripping and you've been looking
really crispy fry
I okay oh when is your hairline coming
out will you ship to the USA hopefully
end of this month early September yes
I'll be shipping to the USA I have a
hairline coming out if you guys don't
know I'm not really big on like pushing
pushing but we did a really gorgeous
campaign shoot of these gorgeous guards
models in Paris so all that beautiful
stuff will be coming out real soon
favorite vacation you guys have ever
taken together for me
favorite vacation I loved our honeymoon
because the first time we've ever been
away together
Mauritius we went to which was beautiful
and although parties because I almost
died Mike almost killed me when we just
got married I'd never ridden a scooter
before and I took my newly beloved wife
on the back of a scooter insurance
rubber core from the storm and crashed
on a four hour journey and got lost
so yeah in a town where you've never
been where they don't speak English and
your French is abysmal
yeah and he stands out like a sore thumb
but I don't know it's fun being the
white people there Mauritius
I love Barcelona actually said well I
love but and also obviously you know
what let me tell you quickly about
Barcelona Michael was so drunk I had to
carry him home I get heels so long
meeting his lightish drinking sangria at
like 9 o'clock thinking it was you know
you know good night that's angry there
was no joke
Michael was confused I thought come I
think I'd like come on honey come on I
took him all the way home I had to carry
this guy
oh so you never let me forget that story
nervous and only time that's happened
and also one place we always go on about
Thailand Thailand is just that place for
us how do you guys say so happy and
positive and that's so nice yeah is
Jesus I mean I am too much how else do
you stay so positive babe we're not I
know in all truth and fairness I think
sometimes social media gives you a
little bit of a like a highlighted
sugar-coated rose-tinted version of life
we do not always you have an idiot I'm
always laughing and smiling and joking
but I do think that we do laughs laughs
Milan joke and dance more than most
people yeah how do we do it then I have
a special game so basically because of
you
otherwise I'd be a bishop bored grumpy
old bastard not honestly my honest
answer to that is just just make effort
don't give up make effort and trusted I
don't constantly make as much effort
trying well try to keep making as much
effort now as you did in the beginning I
don't get comfortable but we are
genuinely best friends although he does
get minor sometimes but we are genuinely
great my best friend about yeah really
nobody's over here mates cause before
time today what are you doing call me
lightly mark was at work he goes out why
are you calling me again because I'm
making sure you're okay because you need
me to is it so wrong better flipping
husband my guy's wife oh okay I see that
it's lunch break between just you right
right yes I'm fine because you're always
moaning on to me oh my god this is not
work in my video didn't come out right
I'm sure my inbox is full my issue
everywhere and I'm cold I cut you call
me up and say I can't find my hairband
really know what a damn hairpin looks
like you're ringing this how what the
hell friend leave Elena yes how did you
know Michael was the one take one look
that's how he didn't look like this
Michael has really developed thanks to
lots of hard work and stuff what was the
conversation
how does na is the one now Michael was
that genuinely someone who we were were
exactly the same
morally Oh God this is a good one I just
watched her snap it zigboo ik God I have
a video about that okay know what it's
like you guys who have graduated and
you're in that in-between stage had this
situation not personally but with my
sister I want to do a whole I keep
saying this I'm going to do a whole
education series of finances what a
question was her question was how what
wouldn't the advice I would give to a 23
year old who's just graduation
graduated and in the transition period
I'm gonna have a whole series on it
because it's something that's really
important to me for those young people
young girls out there to see it's not
all fun and games I know every
looks like it's all gluten earring and
gold being out there snot so don't worry
it's coming now what was your favorite
part of your vacation laughs OH
last night we saw a manta ray oh that
was pretty sick you smuggling was good
something was what's Mike's job I think
you've been asked this about ten million
times yeah physio physiotherapist what
part of London do you live in safe Oh
key to success um well what's the
definition of success Babs
I mean success what area exactly what
would you see success as if you mean to
me success just means living a life that
kind of true to yourself yeah doesn't
necessarily mean oh it's the kind of
cliche thing it doesn't mean having
money and it doesn't mean having where
you were but it just means it doesn't
know honestly it just means that living
the life you want to live and probably
just I don't know having a positive
impact somewhere and I also think I'm a
big or small making your own rules and
living by your own kind of benchmark
yeah that's the success to me because in
fulfilling living trying to live and
compete with the rest of the world is a
recipe to be constantly feeling like I
don't know like a failure because I'll
always be something bigger or something
better so this question is how many
vacations you take in a year do you have
a goal each year to take a certain
number of vacations is it just for for
rejuvenation I would say we have a goal
I just say we do go a lot as we said
before that's just kind of one of the
things that we really enjoy traveling
yeah so we try and go away as much as
possible yeah and I got the goal we just
do what we can really three times a year
would be a minimum for me to go away
yeah all right guys
that is enough questions it's getting
super super dark right now I have to do
a proper Q&amp;amp;A again I get so many
questions they haven't read like a
continent video would be back an
hour-long night you know be like three
hours long these are like just some of
the questions I just can't get through
all of them feel guilty should we show
them quickly what the view is okay do
you want to see our view quickly so I'll
just quickly turn the camera around so
you guys can see what is around us oh if
I can do this without bulldoze in the
whole camera okay is the evenings view
as you can see it's getting quite
now we've got a big fat rain cloud
that's making its way in but it's
actually quite nice if it rains here
that's been hot all day so that's
basically it this video is so random
like it's like a mishmash of lots of
different videos getting wrong so here
hopefully it turns out alright once in a
while you gotta have a random video and
it's a Thursday anyway so yeah now wise
guys
