it is a big one okay
it is a big one it usually is but I'm
really happy with some of the items that
I've got here I can't wait to share and
I'm gonna make this more like a whole
lookbook I've noticed that you guys
really enjoy it when I show the items on
so let's call this like a whole lookbook
and I always say get comfortable get a
cup of tea because it's going to be a
long one but to make it a little bit
short I'm also going to I'm going to
separate out my fashion and graving and
home wear and I'm gonna put Beauty as an
unlisted video so it like the second
part so you can link it you can have a
look at the beauty video in the link in
the description below so let's start off
with Primark I have found myself in
Primark multiple times and you know the
reason you go into Primark initially is
for one thing however you end up with
completely other things so initially I
went in there to find some gym where
I've been working out a lot I can't wait
to show you guys my perfected body when
it's ready
but I went in there to get some nice
right slouchy trousers and all that kind
of stuff and I'm probably not even going
to show you because they're in the wash
now but I ended up writing some other
bits and I think when you're in the
right mood for Primark you can get some
really really good things so first
things first is I bought this really
cool like chunky cardi it's getting
cooler and stuff and I just wanted make
a cardi that I could throw over and this
was I think it was 14 pounds and it's
long and it's slouchy and it's got these
really cool buttons down the middle it's
kind of retro so next I bought this
really amazing denim dress which I saw
on the hangar and I thought this is so
me and the great thing about it is that
you can write with tights
woody jacket and you're good to go I've
actually got a blog post on my blog
wearing this dress because it is just so
so cute I love this and this was 12
pounds I also bought my little Santa
dress from there however it has ripped
on the side so I'm a bit
like that but I did buy that and I think
it was like um eight pounds or not very
expensive but I thought it was really
cute the one good thing I love about
Primark is that you can basically get
lots of home wear and there is actually
really really nice home wearing gym wear
loungewear and they've got their range
called love to lounge so I bought
something a bit more Christmassy I
haven't worn II yes I'm very excited and
it's got like all the Christmassy
decorations on it like the pies and
sparkles and stuff and it's really
really warm and I bought one of these in
last year so I think I buy one of these
every year how much he got if I being
honest in the okay one right now yeah
the secret's out I have my jammy buttons
with all of this but then yeah I bought
a new set and I think this was it was
eight pounds as well but this is that
the little gym top that I bought
it's a nice little grey stretchy fabric
and I bought some bottoms as well but I
don't really need to show you that and I
don't know if you guys remember the
shirt guy Mike was wearing in our video
together but it had Rudolph on it that
was also from Primark it's so so cute
but then I bought myself this little
Christmas jumper as well I like the
color blue and I like his that his eyes
are like boggling movie and I thought
how cute is that I don't have any
Christmas jumper so that was a key one
that I had to have I've been seeing
surely quite a bit recently and she told
her a little secret and she told me the
secret of shapewear mmm-hmm I cannot
tell you where I've been I didn't know
this was the secret right but now I know
the secret secret is out and okay I'll
show you the first thing she recommended
to me was she has some shapewear from
Marks and Spencers and girls this is our
secret I don't want any guys watching
this video basically it's the amazing
power of shapewear and basically this
sucks your stomach in lifts up that bum
and just keeps everything in the right
places them thighs looking tan smooth
and sexy I love this right she was like
yeah she got her
Marks and Spencers literally we were out
I think aware to watch the Spencer's now
went out there and bought this I bought
it in the size 10 I might should have
potentially got a size 8 but you're not
meant to go to small but it really does
hold your body and your shape in and I
loved it so much so I thought I'm going
to primal and I saw that they had their
own version of shapewear theirs is six
pounds this was 35 pounds so I wanted to
compare the quality of the shapewear
maybe I'll do a video on it if you guys
sitting out to the idea then leave a
thumbs up in the comment below but this
is the primal one which is 6 pounds so
next is she inside you guys know that I
like love she inside there's so much
stuff on there and it's so such good
prices like the prices you can't mess
about and people who aren't some you're
actually inside their delivery takes a
very long time right their delivery is
about two or three weeks because it's
coming from Asia so I got I usually
order in advance like at least a month
in a month so I know that I want it and
the sides that often quite small as well
because people always ask me a couple of
details about that but I have to get
myself and Jack here and you guys know I
love my liver and I'm not my black and I
bought this new black jacket and it's
better to see it fun but I just loved
the fact that it's got the quilted
leather sleeves and it's kind of a nice
mortal texture as well and it's just
going to keep me really warm over the
winter period and I also bought a jacket
in bright blue my only thing is that
it's really not very thick this isn't
all of a jacket that looks nice versus
keeps you warm that other jacket will
keep you warm this just looks nice so
this dress I saw on again another go on
like a blog and it looks so so pretty on
but when it came out at all okay but
then I put it on and it just looks so
gorgeous and I'm going away like I'm
always going away anyway but I thought
what kind of dress don't want that's
kind of cute really modern it's got the
drop waist and you know just a bit
better than just wearing a plain black
dress or play whatever dress and that's
what this was very fashionable and
very trendy and it's very flattering if
you've got like bit of a tummy as well
so there was also this dress here that
you guys are trying things that are a
little bit different right and when I
saw this I was like wow this is really
nice it's just got a beautiful shape but
I love the shape of it I love the
pattern on it and again when I saw up on
a couple of dolls and I was just like
yeah I think this dress is going to look
really nice on me and it really does but
then I also picked up this aubergine
jumper which is so retro so cute and
really really smugly as well but then I
also bought this jumper which I
absolutely love because it's like but
really loose and flowy but smug at the
same time look at that look at the
bottom and it's two-tone it's like ombre
and then find the knee I just picked up
this long black dress fit down the side
I've been looking for something like
this for ages and it's just in a jersey
material as well it's nothing that I
would potentially wear out to somewhere
really fancy but if I wanted like that
look I could easily wear this and it's
really cute so for my JustFab pick for
the month I picked up this bag I love it
it's so big it just fits everything you
need in it so big so deep it zips it's
got multiple sips and pockets in it and
I just love the monthly subscription
it's a great way to just get something
nice you pick what you want every month
and that's what I got and I could have
got it in another color but I thought
the black look really classy also went
to Zara and I only bought two things
number one it is the tartan trousers and
I really hope I get some more wear out
of tartan but this these tartan trousers
are amazing they make the bum look like
and they fit really well like they just
fit really well they're really really
flattering and then I bought this jumper
I saw a girl wearing this I was like
this is amazing it's just like a crochet
is it crochet
it's kinda jumper but it's really cute
and what I loved was there never
shoulder pads on it
so I'm part of a little group on YouTube
who are doing a secret Center and it's
all about books so and the kind of
campaigns called books are my bag so I'm
doing it for another guy on YouTube or
her channel below but this book I love
this book it's called the 4-hour
workweek and it's about basically
escaping the night if I live in any
anywhere and during the new rich the
principle of this is about changing your
mindset like changing your mindset and
how you approach life and work and how
you do it and it's not about being rich
it's about living a lifestyle which
makes you feel like you're rich in terms
of how much time that you had and how
much time you spend on things that
mattered that to you a lot of people
spend using years trying to accumulate
money and hope that maybe when they're
70 they'll be able to retire and then
spend all that money but why don't you
have little retirements for your life
and enjoy your life while you can now I
love this book and she is london-based
in this book is called tired of London
pride of life and it's one thing a day
to do in London which I thought is
really cool she did that she recently
did a like an London flat talk I don't
think she is from London but I'm I
bought these with my national and book
tokens as well so next I went to new
look and I bought these now these aren't
everyone's cup of tea but I absolutely
love them I saw them on a wolf-whistle
Amy from wolf-whistle and I just like
where are your shoes from they look so
amazing on her she paired it with like
this little shift dress and she looked
so cute she was like they're from new
look and they're 30 quid and I was like
I went there like two days later and
bought them I love them so I have become
a river island theme like everything in
there something's changed about River
Island something is definitely changed
and I'm not sure what it is about River
Island there's change but it's amazing
like there's so much good stuff in there
right now
I bought this bodycon skirt it's just so
cute so those of you who don't have hips
you don't have five this
is going to give you the illusion of
having what you don't have because of
the pattern on it it's like a little
pencil skirt and it's party season and
stuff now so I just thought I really
liked that
if you guys follow my blog you would
have seen me in this card it is from the
rounded collection it's quite expensive
50 pounds but it's such good quality
it's got like an expose it at the back
it's just very very sexy and it just
does the most for the body paired with
the the secret under where this and that
skirt amazing most of you check out my
blog momento Starcom I've got like me
wearing this stuff in there and I also
bought this sequin top I'm really in
preparation for like party season so I
love this sequin top it's a little crop
top and it's just so sexy and such good
quality and you also bought another pair
of boots and these were 40 pounds
they're the hanging boots really really
nice it's got this really nice exposed
detail at the side and I just need some
stuff that I can wear while it gets a
bit cold and I'm a fan of bits so also
went to Topshop and I've become a big
fan over oh my love and their baby nice
they've got some really good stuff it's
a concession and I bought this are the
crop top it's like a sequin cop top I
think you guys have seen it in another
video of mine but I just thought it was
so cute again would look really good for
the party season and it has a pair of
matching shorts has a pair of matching
shorts that look like that and I haven't
completely decided if I'm going to keep
these because I really can't see me
wearing shorts at this time of year of
the year but yeah they're cute and of
the fact that it's like matching oh and
actually what I was really and she made
me pick this up basically I saw the
picture I was like that's so cute girl
