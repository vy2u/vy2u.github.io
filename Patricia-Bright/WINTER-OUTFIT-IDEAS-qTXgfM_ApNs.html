lookbook that I did while it was snowing

I'd still show you some of the outfits

jeans but I'm absolutely in love with
them at the moment and I've just paired
it with a chiffon and black back when we
share as well as a top on the inside
just to keep me nice and warm I'm
wearing it with a cozy jacket which is
from motel

perfect for the snow but if you're going
out and you've got a car I love this
look my jacket is from forever 21 my
leggings are from love clothing calm and
my shoes are my January kit from JustFab
I absolutely love them I love the color
and they're actually really cozy for
those of you who are gonna say this is
not a winter look trust me I've put a
jacket on top if you're going out for
dinner even if it's cold you should
