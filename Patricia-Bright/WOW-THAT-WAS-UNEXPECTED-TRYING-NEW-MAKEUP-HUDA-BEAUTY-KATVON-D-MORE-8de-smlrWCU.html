beautiful people welcome to my channel I
hope you are doing well I'm excited as I
always am because today we're about to
try some new new some new makeup I
wanted to just have a little play makeup
I feel like I'm not gonna make a video
in at least two or three weeks it feels
like you know too too long I wanted to
try it new in makeup I'm very concerned
that I'm about to mess up this top so
please watch me pray for me that I don't
because it's in the beige category and
I'm applying makeup and it's a potent
egg and it it could be messy or not we
can't afford for it to be messy so we
won't let that happen but yeah we're
gonna try some new makeup and of course
it's gonna include the hooter beauty new
faux filter foundation I've seen a
couple of reviews on here and I was like
you know what I wanted to try it out I
bought it from cult beauty and I didn't
get it sent and I realized I didn't buy
the primer but listen I've got primers
and I'd feel like it's not good to have
a product where you can only use the
partner product with it like come on
not all of us could buy everything and
it actually ended up costing me like 63
pounds I think that's actually a lot for
like foundation you stuff but anyway
irrelevant my lips are really dry so
we're just gonna get into this video and
that got some other stuff from like
models own Kat Von D the new incredible
makeup as well and none of this is
sponsored I just wanted to try in some
new goodies also if you must subscribed
already please subscribe and also you
can follow me on my social and yeah
let's get into it so I wasn't quite sure
what shade to buy so I bought mocha and
I bought a nutmeg there's a lovely lady
whose channel I'm obsessed if her name
is Jocelyn or Jacqueline I can't quite
remember our link I down below
love her makeup videos she's just so
cute and she layers it on but she looks
fabulous and I believe that she used
nutmeg and I thought we were quite
similar in our shades but I've heard
some other people also using the other
shade which is mocha oh I do think I
can't lie that packaging does look
fantastic okay this is nutmeg poopoo
nutmeg nutmeg looks good and ya know for
me I'm I think I'm more of a nutmeg
again my head it came with the brush but
I have brushes and then II won't have to
buy a new brush if I be honest with you
you don't have to buy everything when it
comes out and its new house like now I
don't need that
so I'm just gonna use my cleaning brush
and yeah let's just go in okay see what
the 500 looks like I mean you know
what's crazy I could probably use both
shades but and I'll go with this one
that's nice I suppose I could perfume
like completely smells like a perfume
which I have heard people say I'm
surprised because a lot of people are
allergic to fragrance in skincare so I
find that quite interesting that there
is a smell to it but oh it's full
coverage Wow
oh yes it is beautiful I'm not going to
mind that it looks gorgeous
yes oh just get up here so she goes
right here I've had a little scar that a
little spot that turned into a little
hyperpigmentation spot but you can't see
that at all now I do feel like you have
to blend it quite quickly though rise
down oh and it dries down Matt oh I love
that it almost has like a powder finish
effect yeah it does get calm that's fine
cool if we'll be fine what make it work
that is full coverage I didn't have to
use a lot of product and yes like I'm
feeling that I know you know in the face
just looks monotone okay so next up this
is slightly new I feel like I haven't
really heard people talking about it but
this came in my PR like a couple of
weeks back and I picked it out and I
started using it it is called the
instant full coverage concealer this
concealer oMG when they say full
coverage it is
so full coverage I can't call this a
first impressions because I just started
using this two or three weeks ago and I
haven't showed you guys it's just
amazing so it's new and you guys have to
see it
I love the applicator of it and the
shades that I really like are amber and
golden you see like honestly the level
of coverage is a lot golden I use if I
really want that high light dramatic
look and Amber's more every day so I'll
show you golden and you know what you
can't get carried away with it's because
it's levels is real no it's not amber
that's golden the other one is so-called
almond and I love it seeing as the faux
filter is so full coverage we need to
just cover the under eyes if you guys
don't know I've been as sick as a dog
this is like my first time you know
getting back out to real life like it's
crazy so yeah I need the concealer to
cover the dark circles now next up I'm
gonna go in with these new foundation
sticks these come fall models own I was
sent these I'm not paid or anything to
review them and I thought it was very
interesting because when I saw the
leaflet it had like like roads and loads
of shades which was really really nice
and they came up with lead uh and I
think models Oh was actually in nail
polish brand and they've gone into
beauty and I've noticed that people are
doing that a lot now which is super
interesting so these are the foundation
sticks and they've got this bit in the
middle which I don't quite understand
why it's there but I did think it looked
really cool when I was excited to see
that the dark actually looks like it
could go down dark because sometimes
it's like dark and it's like literally
my my base foundation color kind of I've
given me that like iconic London vibes
that's what it's kind of reminding me
off but it's fine let's go in let's try
I'm gonna go in with this shade which is
55 whew might even be too dark that's
really really dark that's potentially
too dark for me Wow
okay that's nice okay let's try this
see this is more my actual shades right
we're going to govern with the deep dark
then to contour but I'll be honest these
are foundation sticks so you're just
gonna we're just gonna go in then it's
it's very dark it's very very made up I
wonder if they've got another shade I'm
going to see because I'm gonna end up
having to blend really really hard
rarely do I have the problem of
something being too dark for me I'm
gonna see if they have other shades
that's crazy is that I couldn't find but
a slightly lighter shade but I found a
darker shade also this is this is the
marketing sheet that came which is super
cute and look at that it looks like
they've got loads of different shades
which that's really really nice and it's
only $9.99 I don't know I'm telling you
all this information you don't need to
know this we're just gonna blend it real
hard because yeah it's quite a dark
contour shade I mean I could just match
my nose like have it snatched okay next
this is something else that came in my
PR this is the Kat Von D saints and
sinners and I shadow palette I love it I
feel like going oh it's pretty let's
just take a moment to look at that it's
very nice very very very very nice I
will say I do slightly feel like Kat Von
D's alrighty jumping off not gonna lie
ah I'm gonna use this pink lit up we're
gonna use pink later people sorry
I'm excited oh I hate the names oh I'm
so close like not using the palette
because of the names we've got a shade
that I'd really like the shade of which
is an orange and it's called devil why
am I gonna put that on my eyes crucifix
exorcism relic rapture ashes I don't
like the names it's just it's just a
little bit dark for me and I know it
might sound really petty and stuff but
why am I gonna put a shade called devil
on my eyes
never if my mom saw this planet should
start praying fast you don't need to do
this I've got to use Marta because it's
nice little you know this is more of a
like base lid shade
yeah well thing is my atonement to be
honest why would you have such nice
shades and such dead names ah
the church will have a name on there
called dead or death murder you don't
need this chill that's a nice little
shade for letting me in at my lids I'm
just looking at this palette sad I'm
gonna get I'm gonna get another palette
so I'm gonna get some shades on my zoeva
nude spectrum palette I cannot believe
I'm not like no I'm not about to start
using devil or my eyelid just just
doesn't make no sense so yeah we're
going to come back to some of the other
colors there that's fine then I go in
with a brown shade from there's a weaver
palette oh and I'm actually using a
zoeva brush to do that nice that's just
a nice little matte Brown then I'm gonna
go back in with to the saints and
sinners palette and I'm gonna go back in
with the martyr which is like the
mustard II color just to add a little
warmth to that I will say with the Kat
Von D eyeshadows they're super super
pigmented not too powdery so even like
they're great for novices or people who
aren't like major makeup people like
myself and then on my lid I'm going to
go with the shade out of the kat von d
palette playlist
let's try rosary which is more like a
purple color Hey oh it's it's pretty and
again really nice really pigmented it's
like a purpley pink as well and then
there's this beautiful shade here could
rapture ah beautiful which is glitter
and I'm just like yes really really nice
and it doesn't even have any fallout and
I feel like I'm just gonna go in with a
little bit more Brown to just blend
you know what that palette that saints
and sinners palette though some of the
colors are pretty I don't really know
how wearable they are and the names are
just off-putting so we're going back
into zoeva oh just to give me a little
bit of a gold on my inner you know i
okay we need to set because you girls
look as shiny right I'm going to go
ahead and just set with my sash about ah
I know I need to change powders like
people have been telling me I need to
I love Sascha
I finished like three tons of it and I
will say with this concealer it doesn't
it doesn't really need a lot of setting
to be honest of you and the one thing
I've noticed is that it moves so it
moves if you put too much on and if
you're too rough with it and if you
apply it if you apply powder that's
straight after it will move why I'm just
adding some mascara I'm gonna go in with
the low lashes these bad boys are super
pretty
okay these dramatic earth lashes are on
oh my god
I feel like I'm about to fly away and
I'm going to go in with the huda beauty
winter highlight palette the I'm gonna
write the picture on the front is Lee
with you I don't know if these shades oh
okay that's cute actually winter Rose
looks kind of to you I feel like they
might be slightly ashy for me not really
sure but look at that that's what those
look like
plus the frosted kisses verge is just
white Northern Lights I thought would be
really ashy but it isn't I cannot get
enough of this Wendy brush on this Lou
okay that's cute my try winter rose on
this side oh that is pretty
I thought it would look a lot at even
map but it doesn't
what is frosted kiss oh it's a cream
in highlight with a pink iridescent I
love makeup wear it it's not what you
think it is that is the way to go that
is beautiful I can keep piling that on
there so I've got these bag of lip
products which are from incredible which
is a new makeup brand by nails ink so
now zinc and nothing nail polishes and
they've created lip products it's a
jelly shot okay this is a oh yes
well that just broke was it that just
broke that broke where there's a little
rose in it I don't know why that just
broke it's a little bit let me see if
there's any more of those it's actually
probably a bit too soft of a bomb or
maybe that one's defective and I don't
have another jelly in there to show you
but at least my lips still got some of
the moisturization check that out
that's a shit iridescent sheer gloss is
also mattes
here's another jelly shot which it is
pretty not gonna lie it is pretty
I've got of like a rose in it or little
flower in it that is so pretty
oh nice this lip paint here this is a
nice like brownie beige lip liquid lip
pain pretty okay it's literally exactly
the same color as my skin gonna go in
with another lip pain that colors a lot
nicer and goes really well with the eye
look I mean as a lip paint it's not as
full full full coverage as some of the
other lip paints I normally wear but it
feels really nice on finished look gonna
just set it cuz I feel like I look quite
matte but overall I like it feel very
pinky in pretty well okay so that is my
finished look of a new in goodies what
is it my stand out hero product it's got
to be the hooter Beatty foundation it's
flawless it's actually flawless and I'm
surprised at the highlight are the
winter white light palette which I
thought was gonna be ash looks amazing
the Capaldi saints and sinners palette
their names are off-putting I feel like
I need to just pray and watch myself
with like holy water now there's some
great
great great individual shades as I all
my gosh that's great that's great that's
great I just didn't feel like I could
layer them together based on the one
pallet and then oh the models own
foundation stick surprising creamy full
coverage dark and they had dark huh I'm
not mad at that
and then finally we have the incredible
ER I mean there's a lot of lip products
probably a little too many and but maybe
that's because I heard the whole bag of
them but they look nice and they felt
they feel nice so we'll see how that
wears but that is my full face of purse
