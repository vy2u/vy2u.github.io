from the Reebok +16 oh these are cute
these are so cute well classics high-top
Reebok trainers thank you I don't know
it's so fluffy that is that which cycled
envelope I'm not mad I like the idea of
recycling so I'm all good with that ok
this box is I can tell because the logo
on the outside is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills okay what we got in here I don't
know what we've got in here
we got unmov'd office address so a lot
of items that I was being sent from
Anastasia it was actually being sent
back to them they message me said all
your items are being sent back so I
missed out on certain things like the
subculture speaking of the devil
like the subculture palate I mean we all
kind of know the drama around the
subculture palliate is it too late to
review it's just too late to review but
to be honest I still wanted the palette
I saw all the drama on it and I still
wanted it oh god why this packaging
looks so nice though it just looks it
looks
oh my office for those of you who don't
know basically this product had a lot of
criticism for being subpar and it wasn't
due to people's application
just that there was something dodgy
about the palette I mean I think you
have to try it to really know for
yourself and from what I've seen is that
you have to just be extremely careful
with it but I'm still gonna try it
anyway look at this this is gorgeous I
didn't see anyone else show this maybe
this is a new version hope it is this is
some shoes
hello okay what's this - Patricia so
sorry couldn't make the breakfast we
hope you love these ego shoes okay I
think either from ego official although
you know what's crazy there's literally
no branding anywhere these shoes could
be from anywhere just that I know that
it's from ego but there's nothing to say
these are ego shoes not even on the box
that is really strange have you guys
ever ordered from ego before is that
usual I don't know yeah these look kind
of satiny strap sandal which is Q quite
simple
I'm not mad at them and I know the fact
that there's some have another satin
shoe for quite a while or maybe we'll
review ego okay
oh body shop again they've sent me and
that's clay foundations in all the white
shades be strange we hope you enjoy
these goodies from the body shop
these are all shades I can't wear
however they have given me Santa comb or
not which is a shade I do wear and this
foundation is amazing I love this
foundation it's really really good but
they've given me really beach getaway no
it's a good it's a good foundation I
really like this foundation but this is
what you get in PR it's like there are
literally eight shades here makeup okay
there's six shades here I can't wear and
then my actual shade so I appreciate
that probably shouldn't shake the box it
says let the countdown begin to clear a
skin emergency so

would be doing the most look at this
case it's got beaded it's a mirror with
Charlotte Tilbury on the front of it and
