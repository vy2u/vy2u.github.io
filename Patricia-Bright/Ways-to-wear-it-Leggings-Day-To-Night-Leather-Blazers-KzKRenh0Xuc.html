going to be a look that includes
leggings and I thought to myself some
people may you know I see different ways
they can wear all daytime to evening now
I really really love wearing leggings
just a bit such an easy thing to kind of
throw on and my preference sister from
like a really long kind of card your
best or a t-shirt like this one here and
these these leggings are from Zara and
this is from Zara as well I think a
casualty with the pair of leggings can
always look really really nice as long
as you cover your crack people don't
need to see crack well sadly sometimes I
don't anything that it depends on one
wearing with that and you know this is
kind of casual and everything you can
throw it away the jacket with leather
jacket it's kind of kind of hard but
kind of like I've not really made much
effort just a nice pair of that right
you know she's on right now third
totally immersive fro like a braised art
and this is my heritage blazer from
acecomm and it's just you know the
leggings always look really cool and
with a pair of heels as well they're
always
an example of how I would wear leggings
in the evening I would go for a more
kind of high shine legging or like
leather leggins or leggings with designs
on them but you know you don't want to
be too cheap or too tacky and this is an
example also where I would wear it
without a long top I would never work
with a tight top I wear the top that has
brought you in it and I'm not I felt
quite comfortable it gives you an
amazing silhoue it's all dependent on
what your body looks like though so if I
don't like showing too much dye or
something that I wouldn't do this but
you know you can kind of fix it up and
sort it out and the high shine ones just
make me look so smooth and silky yeah
and I was thinking about all black and
like some really nice killer killer
heels I think a great thing that you
kind of put on with an outfit like this
now because it's all black which is kind
of me I would then put something right
on top like a bright blade this is my
gold blazer which is actually from H&amp;amp;M
and it's got some lovely lovely
detailing on it and this is how I would
definitely wear this in the evening
it kind of be like you know all black
understated jewelry and a gold blazer on
top to kind of keep it looking really
chic and really really classy that's
what I tried to do so how you do that
video that's watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
