video is going to be all about wearing
see-through clothing there are two types
of seafood clothing that you could kind
of get away with one is kind of a mesh
see-through so this is literally a case
of the way that the fabric has been put
together as you can see this fabric has
holes in it this is the top of try and
bought from Primark the second type of
see if we can get is literally it's a
case of the fabric is entirely sheer and
it is really really see through this is
a top which I purchased a batwing shirt
which was supplied to me by stars of
Sofia calm and this is the item that I'm
going to focus on on today so with a
mesh see-through top I think you can get
away with loads because really there's
not that much flesh on show you can wear
a bra underneath or you know whatever
you want to wear underneath what nothing
tell me nothing but yeah you can get
away with a lot more and it really
doesn't matter what you earn the bottom
off I think though main thing to
consider if you've got a lot of fresh on
the top on show you want to minimize
what you're showing on the bottom
so in the top of shimmers this it gets
really really complicated in the way in
which you can wear it my advice kind of
is the case of you don't want more than
three inches of midriff ash on show at
any time if you were to go ahead and
wear this with a pair of jeans my advice
would not be to wear a bra and don't go
without bra my advice would be to go
ahead and wear like a vest or a bandeau
top underneath this is example the
bandeau top that I really really like
these are from Urban Outfitters we can
pick them up in I thinking of the
Primark you can get them in H&amp;amp;M and it's
literally like a really cube bender with
lace detailing as well and that just
adds to what's underneath the shirt as
well and it means that you've not got
all this bit and show that bits covered
up and if you've got your belly button
or show then fair enough
so the second way you can go ahead and
wear the show is really you can work
with the bra so you are going around
with just a bra you need to go
high-waisted this is my opinion but I
entirely think you shouldn't wear a bra
and then I like a short club you want
your brand all this bit on showing your
vent no no no go high-waisted and keep
it in a good I was the short so tired
high waisted jeans
high-waisted skirt anything that's going
to cut me your belly button ensure that
you have no more than two or three
inches on show in the middle
so guys that's the different ways that I
enjoy wearing see-through thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
