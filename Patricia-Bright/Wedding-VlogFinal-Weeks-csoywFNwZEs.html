video is gonna be a wedding update but I
can't call it what it update cuz I've
already said I've done my final wedding
update but I thought you guys may want
to know like where I am with things as
the final few days from a few weeks till
I get married I'll be married in at the
end of March the final week of March so
it's coming up really really quickly on
us and stuff so I've been getting so
many questions and how is in what's it
like and you can kind of tell I'm weird
I'm weary I'm weary I'm gonna do another
video actually like a vlogging video
I've got some stuff that I'll have ready
for you while I'm away
you know me guys I'm just far too
proactive for my liking and but more you
know this isn't a this is just gonna be
a vlog okay so we'll talk about wedding
and I'll just talk about life in general
because it's been really really
difficult over the past few weeks and
past few days okay so in terms of the
wedding everything is prepared I had a
few issues with you know having a DJ and
a videographer and stuff like that but
hopefully that sorted out I have paid a
DJ who has become recommended and I have
a VIP meeting up with her videographer
tomorrow so I will be filming the
wedding and you guys will get to see my
wedding I will probably either do a
little 10-minute video with all the
footage from my wedding because I want
you guys to see it's an amazing joyful
event and I'm oh you know me I like
sharing things that are going on in my
life and yeah what else so that's done
dresses are done I didn't have to have
too many adjustments done to my dress
when it came back and all the girls got
their bridesmaids dresses I'll show you
a quick sneak peek so you can see that
everything's just looking good we got
some decorators
who do all the decorations for us and
we're guessing like really big
candelabras on the tables and we may do
a few bits here and there I'm gonna do
the flowers myself or I have people who
are going to do them for me so we'll go
to the buffalo market and just pick our
flowers on the Friday before the wedding
and then they'll kind of put them into
lovely jars of water and stuff like that
cuz all this stuff and you can actually
do yourself and I'm not gonna pay for
800 pounds of flowers and it has been
it's been expensive and I think you know
most people go over their budget we've
gone over my chair hopefully not too
much we pay for it all of our ourselves
and you know it we've had some input
from our parents here and there but
really we've covered this ourselves
we've not done anything on credit it's
just not the way we do so you can
imagine you know it's an investment and
it's an investment for like a huge party
basically the biggest party of our lives
so you might as well spend on the a so
that's all done you know to be honest I
just want to go away you can tell how
worried I am I just want to go to on
honeymoon and be done with her thing so
much drama but my sister I have an older
sister that you guys have probably never
mentioned her an older sister who lives
in Nigeria who read that the last time I
saw her was about 10 years ago and she
will be coming when she's three sons so
I'm really excited about that she'll be
coming down to London for the wedding I
had the girls coming from New York who I
interned well who we worked on the same
graduate program when I worked at the
bank and they'll be coming down so I'm
so happy just the opportunity just to
see everyone and just have a good good
time
the girls will new to you I've invited
whoever wanted to down and I can't wait
so I come like a little YouTube came
like a girl's never be there were there
cover good stuff like that yeah what is
else is there and you know wedding shoes
is one thing that's been irritating me
you probably saw my home video and I was
like do I even need wedding shoes
wedding shoes that you'll never see I
don't like sparkles I don't like shining
like shoes what is the point in spending
on
50 pounds of shoes that I've never wear
again and who note don't even see so
whatever so no being think about that
and like catering and everything we're
having a part sit-down dinner and what
will be a set a set menu and we will
have a buffet as well so we basically
got the best of both worlds for the
people who like the order of table
service and then the people who like the
buffet and the chicken at the end so
we've got that going down what is it
Mike Mike's cool white always cool so
he's good to go really and other than
that everything's planned it's an issue
of my living arrangements you know
living at home with my parents and you
might haven't had any where we haven't
found anywhere to live so there's a
question of where do we live we have
nowhere to live right now and after the
wedding where do we live so it looks
like I'm actually gonna be moving to
where he lives so he lives in Mike
another poor sorry on campus like on
hospital campus and it's like one room
so we're gonna start off on married life
in one room yeah and that's just because
we don't have enough time to one find
somewhere to buy which is our aim but
you know if you're gonna buy a house you
need to have time you don't just rush
into buying a house so but we still
haven't got time to find somewhere to
rent so hopefully we're just gonna move
in there and sort that out and I think
I've been under huge amounts of
absolutely huge amounts of pressure you
know my job yeah just you know starting
a new job new environment you uh you
know wedding planning I having somewhere
to near that home lots of lots of lots
of pressure and you know everyone has
their demands I think you should do it
like this you should do like that and
the planner person that I know my way
I don't want to do that will fight I'm
not doing what you're telling me I'm not
gonna do it like and I feel like I've
been battling battling I I don't want to
do these silly things that I just see is
just protocol for the sake of protocol
like in my mind having millions and
millions of guests as ridiculous in my
mom's
- like no way to dispense me have to do
these no I don't have to do anything I
could elope if I wanted to elope so yeah
I've been dealing with all of that and
I'm not gonna complain it's all good
there are like two weeks to go and I
just can't wait to be married to my
husband and that's it I don't give two
hoots about weddings I don't give two
hoots that's what I've realized oh who
needs a wedding well yeah you do if you
wanna get married so that is it but you
know I'm excited I'm happy I'm joyful
I've got the best husband in the world
as you guys know where else is that I
feel like there's something I was meant
to tell you I haven't told you yet I
don't know what it is but you know guys
I'm telling you because you know I like
looking and I will like while I'm gone I
have stuff lined up for you some very
special stuff so keeping the loop you
know I'm gonna have is the FRA while I'm
away for the girls because I care and
I'm not sure how soon I have the wedding
video it just depends on how soon I get
it and yeah and oh well I'm not I'm not
gonna say I'm not even gonna say I have
such a big mouth I really want to be I
hope I meet guys but I'm not gonna say
we'll just see till after the wedding
anyway wedding vlog over and done with
