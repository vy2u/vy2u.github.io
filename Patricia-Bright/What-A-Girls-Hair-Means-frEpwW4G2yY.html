all the questions that I've had finally
about hair it has taken me a really long
time to come and do this video and it's
just because this is basically the most
asked question on my channel about my
hair yeah let us start from the top
start from the beginning and apologies
to those who this doesn't necessarily
rent to relate to but you know it might
be interesting if you want to know about
hair extensions we use and afros and all
that kind of stuff
now this is the person you want to ask
which it will you all Arts is like what
hair extensions do I wear and like how
do I install it so let's get to it
know I've probably mentioned this last
year is that basically I get my own hair
extensions I do not go to the shops and
buy them I get my own hair extensions
from a suppliers I do think they're
fairly unique I like hair that looks
like it could be mine
so this hair is basically what they call
a light yucky texture so it looks like
relaxed hair so it's long but it's got
texture in it it might not look so
textured on the camera but like hey like
in real life it basically looks textured
to blend with my own hair and admit and
it means that I don't have to basically
straighten my hair all the time to get
it to blend and stuff like that and I
just like the texture gives it a lot
more volume so I don't have to wear like
20 million packs or weave on my hair I
only use two packs maybe two and a half
if I'm looking if I've got longer hair
and that's it so there is a website
there is a facebook page there was a
website in the process of being
developed it will be coming guys it will
be coming just follow the Facebook page
which are linked below and then they
will like then updates there the thing
is is that I can't maintain it myself so
by God's grace I will be employing
people so people who are looking for
jobs all right I want to be an employer
and be able to help people so it's all
coming it's all
in the process okay guys it's all in the
process time nine okay they've got stop
now and we have girls who basically
order 20 packs at time and that's why I
don't advertise it I don't talk about it
because we can't like the stock goes but
just way too quickly for me to basically
say oh we've got stopped and then it
just goes just like that so we get a lot
of repeat orders and people calling my
phone they know who they are like do you
have any hair means it's like crack with
some people but that's fine I really
like that and there will be more and
there'll be more textures and more
colors and everything like that really
really soon so just keep your eyes and
ears peeled on that page so how do I
install it or well basically it is my
clips clips in in a new part direction
okay but I might click them onto a cat
or sew them onto a cat and then click
that around my head I should show you I
might do a tutorial basically because
I've got these combs that you can
literally just kind of slide it in slide
it in all the way around and basically
there's a u-shape so for my own hair
- come on the top so what you'll be able
to see that well you won't be able to
see because this hair blends seamlessly
with my own hair like this that um this
is my hair basically that is my hair on
top I really don't have a lot of hair on
top anyway don't know if it's messed up
right yep so my own hair is all out on
the top I do not like those closures
that people grow glue on i fin they look
like helmets but I'm not one to say but
I just hates them so I've never and well
one I probably straighten my own hair
once a week over the top but that's why
you might see me change my part so I
might wear part you know that week one
day there one day one there so that
means that I'm only really straightening
the same
area every other and every other week or
every three weeks so that's the best way
for me to maintain my hair so you
sometimes see me wearing my hair up in a
bun
that's because basically I'm wearing my
own hair as well as if you want to ask
the kind of lengths I wear in my sorry
that I'm touching it so much um I
usually wear twelve on the top that
gives you a more layered effects and
those are the shorter layers come from
and I won't wear a 14 in the middle and
then I'd wear an 18 at the bottom for
leather might use a whole pack of 18 at
the bottom a half a pack of sixteen in
the middle and then half a pack of 12 of
16 or 14 in the middle and a half a pack
of 12 at the top or something like that
so I end up using two paths and you'll
find that there's longer lengths you
have less hair in a pack and then in 12
inches you'll have right loads I think
that's thick
I washed this hair peppery probably once
a week or once every two weeks from the
family meal once a month because the
thing is I don't wear hair extensions
all the time I do when I'm on YouTube
but I don't really wear them to work
very regularly maybe I put my hair up in
a bun and have maybe like run extensions
on the end but like I wear them a week
and then don't with them week when we're
done with them a week or something
that's what choleric comments which is
actually more or less a dark brown it's
not jet black but you can color it I
might ombre this part this kind of
luscious right now so it might not cover
it but it can be colored
I've had it people color it jet black
before I've had people call it brown
before I think someone knows she colored
it red it can be colored it's fine
how long does it last well I can tell
you that for my wedding I the hair that
I wore for my wedding which was the same
hair
I had a litter I stopped throwing it
like Tilly
so like three months four months and I
still have it so if I want to kind of
think about a few tracks of that in
there but that here was a bit of a
silkier texture
I'll talk about that later and I put a
few clips in here of that and it's fine
really
yeah why do I wear hair extensions um I
like them I like the long I like the
long hair my hair itself is naturally
fine not because of hair extensions not
because of I'm relaxed when they're even
that's natural
by the time you straighten that hair it
just looked like Shh
my hair is fairly fine and I think it
looks boring like just Aboriginal pet I
do wear average hemp I just think he
looks at average so I'd like a birth
average to be on it yeah and a big
question is what does Mike think about
my hair edges and as long as he doesn't
have to see them because he thinks they
look like basically a drowning cat he
doesn't care but because honestly I
don't wear them a lot like at home or
you know on a day-to-day basis so how
much you provide my own hair but if I
look nice and glamorous when they're
with him but I don't
I shouldn't depend on him I don't depend
on them at all like you might see that
if you watch I feel my Instagram and
Facebook and stuff I might we one day a
weaver the other day and I like that I
like the flexibility of where my own
hair hearing there but for YouTube you
want to keep the glamour glamour
glamorous so yes for those who are - my
hair is chemically relaxed I have
relaxed hair I've had relaxed hair for
the past two years so those of you who
say to me you know you should go natural
blah blah blah all that kind of stuff
and actually was natural for three years
I transitioned had the afro and
everything the natural hair and I just
felt like a change I found that my hair
was a bit difficult to manage and you
know I do the twist outs and the braid
outs and cohosh in the blah blah blah
like and I found I just didn't feel like
I don't know I just the maintenance and
they're like focus that I
had to have on my head when I was
natural was more than I was winning to
put in there said you know what I'm
gonna slap over like so in it and I
since I've done that I found my hair
much more maintainable and to Venice
more healthy and I'm not saying that
relaxers are the healthiest way to go
for your hair but I used to suffer from
like that it ends of my hair always used
to get tangled cuz I've got really
really coarse hair and I couldn't really
hope my hair was that hurting when I
came to I was actually no I'm not gonna
do this anymore so and the next day and
since then I've been able to kind of
maintain me then I try to grow it out
and I grew it down but I just was like
this is more effort than I'm winning so
then I got caught in December and since
then I've maintained that and I go to
the hairdresser's so I wash my hair once
a week and I always do a deep
conditioning treatment there I use a
sulfate-free shampoo every other week
and then I use a sulfate shampoo every
week so honestly I don't use that many
products on my hair I realize what I do
use I use care for cares like it's a
moisturizing balm and then I use a
natural oil so the ones I like using are
sesame not sesame sweet almond oil I
love that grapeseed oil I love and at
the moment castor oil if you have like
really greasy hair or hair that's fairly
fine
I wouldn't use castor oil but for me I
love castor oil
it really makes sure that my hair does
not dry out and like you only need to
use it once a week or twice a week and
that is perfect for me and my has a
really good condition
I do not blow-dry or use heat on my hair
maybe once a month or once every two
months or something but I will
straighten the hair that I wear on my
lever how regularly do I relax my hair
I aim to relax my hair every 12 weeks so
I have enough like regrowth to just
touch up and I never overlap at all and
that's why I go to a professional to do
it I did do it myself
in the past but was just under
processing my hair so ended up being
really frizzy on the ends so I'm at the
point of truth still trying to chop
those ends off but now it's all growing
in fairly nicely I really like at the
moment what relaxer do I use I use
Amazon you relaxer and I use it in this
the light strength that's it that is it
