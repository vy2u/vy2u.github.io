today's weed is going to be a quick
outfit of the day
it's summer and wedding season is here
and some of you may want a few outfit
ideas for wedding so this is one my
recent noodles to wedding I intended
so for weddings I think it's really
important to wear some bright colors
it's just adds to the sense of occasion
here I'm wearing a bright lime green top
with some extra detailing on the bottom
I think we're in colors of black and
white as well adds a great bit of
contrast I've played this with my Prada
bag for wearing this maxi skirt which I
bought from Oasis I love
maxi's and pleats and a little bit of
leg it's just perfect for the wedding
season in my opinion and finally I just
added some floral wedges just to add to
color and this that summer feeling so
hope you enjoyed that quick video if you
do want to see more quick outfit of the
day so make sure you remember to like
and to subscribe thanks watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
