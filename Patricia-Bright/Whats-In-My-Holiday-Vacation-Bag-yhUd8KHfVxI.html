what's in my holiday bag I'm off on
holiday today i'm off to Thailand and
obviously I've got so much time for
recording when I should be on my way to
the airport but yeah i'm recording
instead none it's fine i've got plenty
that was like four hours to go so this
is the bag that I'm taking and it's my
JustFab pick for februari and I picked
this venue is huge and I knew that I
we're really basics to the airport so
wanted to get something that was quite
bright and like large as well and it's
so sturdy because this thing is rammed
packed right now but all I will carry on
to the play with me will be this and I
need to fit everything in there so first
of all it's my product so not
necessarily makeup but beauty product so
things like face wipes I have
antibacterial wipes so wet ones and
purchase my hands i also have a cleanser
so if i fall asleep or something and I
want to take my makeup off I can go to
the bathroom and use the water and take
the makeup off and it's quite a
moisturizing one so it's not too bad and
I departed basically a lot of my main
products that I've got in my room and
put them on to all little tiny tubs and
you're being really surprised but my
best moisturizer is actually II 45 and I
find it's the best thing for my skin in
terms of hydration and I've just wrote
me 45 on the back and this is what I'll
be taking on holiday with me and that's
what I use on my face so if I wash our
moisturizer this got a nail polish
remover in there that's it really so
that's what I've got in terms of beauty
products and I don't know nan makeup
stuff I do have a few makeup products in
here just because they couldn't fit into
my clear bag but and that's fine so I've
got a brush palette and a quality r for
mac which has got a couple of different
kind of a nutshell what's in there but
this is all the makeup in terms of
different brushes and different
eyeshadows i'm taking away with me this
might not seem a lot these are the only
brushes that i'll be taking away with me
spoolie brush an angle brush blush and
contour brush and a stifling brush and
just two eyeshadow brushes so that's all
I need in my collection on holiday they
also have these puffs applicators
because i really like these actually for
my foundation and that's it i also have
a toothbrush in here because you don't
want spendy breath and just little
sample perfume so this is a Chloe one
here and I've got a bad leg to yoga one
as well and the reason being is just
that I don't want to get there and
they're like oh your perfume bottles too
big and then they take it from me i also
have an avin I cream because I get
really dry eyes like underneath here
it's been a recent thing so I'm trying
to work on it so I've got this with me i
paid about 10 pounds of this and i just
use it at night and just to keep my lips
nice and moist I've got burt's bees
beeswax lip balm so I also carry my vlog
camera as well this is the vlog camera
that I use if anyone wanted to know and
I will be vlogging my whole holiday like
every single day overall my vlog channel
so i'll put the link below and you guys
can hopefully watches having fun in
thailand and i'm also carrying my 550d
with me i do have a 6th ed i won't be
bringing that with me to thailand just
in case something happens but this is
what my main camera and it's much
lighter cuz i've got a massive lens on
my new camera as well so so you've got
to have some have some tic tacs although
it's kind of empty but just tastes good
and keeps my breath fresh and sunglasses
are an absolute must because when i wake
up and do buy it and I'm like Haggard I
just celebrity oh who is that is it
Beyonce no but uh I just like these if
I'm sleeping and I just looked Haggard
when I wake up was at bright lipstick
you look a lot better so I carry these
in here and these are from a zose I also
carry headphones of course listening to
music on my phone and then I carry some
flat shoes with me because I'm actually
wearing heels to the airport and the
only reason why I did that is because I
wanted my suitcase to be lighter
wearing make sure you can't see that my
chunky wedge is instead and then I'm
carrying a Marie Claire with me just for
entertainment I always carry a diary and
a couple of pins as well just because I
love taking notes and having mine dumps
the novel that I'm Tate and I'm not a
massive reader like I only read for
education but rather than entertainment
but um I heard about this book the woman
who went to bed for a year so that will
be coming along with me and I'll start
my reading on the plane I carry some
deodorant with me and then it's really
weird i don't i'm wearing jeans what i
had she not very comfortable and planes
and jeans so I've brought my own pleated
maxi skirt and I didn't want to wear the
maxi skirt and there because it can be a
bit you know when you're walking up and
down stairs maxi skirts aren't the best
things and carrying suitcases but I just
roll it up into like a really tight ball
and then I will take off my jeans and
wear this on the plane being the person
that I am I basically got my passport
and travel money in one folder so I'm
bit worried my battery's a little low
but hopefully it doesn't die but I also
carry a headscarf with me because when
I'm like asleep on the plane I just
don't like my hair like rubbing on the
back of the plane seats because you
never know I know they've got these new
sheets and stuff that they put on but
it's a bit rippy and not very nice so I
carry a scarf with me to wrap around my
head I know it might be a little bit
ghetto but you got to do what you got to
do and finally this is my makeup bag and
this is actually the only make up I'm
taking with me and two on the holiday
but key things in here a pair of
eyelashes and the pair that I'm wearing
I've got loads of lipsticks with me
probably about four lipsticks but who
knows if I'd wear them and then I've
also got my Maybelline falsies volume
lashes I've got my Mac match masters in
the 8.5 but this isn't I've now got a
new favorite which is what I'm wearing
which is the bobby brown in a believe
it's a walnut m7 something or the other
he always carry my concealer and a
darker eyeshadow and this is embarked
the rest of it is a plethora of lip
glosses and lipsticks so guys that is my
what's in my holiday bag and it does zip
up it does the part this bag is massive
and it really does get everything in it
so I'm very glad that I pick this for
februari and I will definitely let you
guys see how it does over the holiday
and hopefully it's not too heavy for me
so guys I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
