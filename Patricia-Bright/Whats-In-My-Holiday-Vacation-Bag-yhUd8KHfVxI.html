what's in my holiday bag I'm off on
holiday today I'm off to Thailand and
obviously I've got so much time for
recording when I should be on my way to
the airport but yeah I'm recording
instead no it's fine I've got plenty
about I was like four hours to go so
this is the bag that I'm taking and it's
my JustFab pick for February and I
picked this cuz I knew as huge and I
knew that I wear really basics to the
airport so I wanted to get something
that was quite bright and like large as
well and it's so sturdy because this
thing is ramped packed right now but all
I walk carry on to the plane with me
will be this and I need to fit
everything in there so first of all it's
my product so not necessarily makeup but
Beauty product so things like face wipes
I have a bacterial wipes so wet ones and
for just my hands I also have a cleanser
so if I fall asleep or something and I
want to take my makeup off I can go to
the bathroom and use the water and take
the makeup off and it's quite a
moisturizing one so it's not too bad and
I've departed basically a lot of my main
products that I've got in my room and
put them onto all little tiny tubs and
you're being really surprised but my
best moisturizer is actually e45 and I
find it's the best thing for my skin in
terms of hydration and I've just written
e45 on the back and this is what I'll be
taking on holiday with me and that's
what I use on my face so if I wash our
moisturizer this got a nail polish
remover in there that's it really so
that's what I've got in terms of beauty
products and that no non makeup stuff I
do have a few makeup products in here
just because they couldn't fit into my
clear bag but and that's fine so I've
got a brush palette and a quarter for
Mac which has got a couple of different
colors of mushroom what's in there but
this is all the makeup in terms of
different brushes and different
eyeshadows I'm taking away with me this
might not seem a lot these are the only
brushes that I'll be taking away with me
spooley brush an angle brush blush and
contour brush and a stifling brush and
just two eyeshadow brushes so that's all
I need in my collection on holiday and
they also have these puff applicators
because I really like these actually for
my foundation and that's it you also
have a toothbrush in here because you
don't want spend your breath and just a
little sample perfume so this is a Chloe
one here and I've got a balance the
other one as well and the reason being
is just that I don't want to get there
and they're like oh your perfume bottles
too big and then they take it from me I
also have an avian eye cream because I
get really dry eyes like underneath here
it's been a recent thing so I'm trying
to work on it so I've got this with me I
paid about ten pounds of this and I just
use it at night and just to keep my lips
nice and moist
I've got Burt's Bees bees wax lips mom
so I also carry my vlog camera as well
this is the vlog camera that I use if
anyone wanted to know and I will be
vlogging my whole holiday like every
single day over on my vlog channel so
I'll put the link below and you guys can
hopefully watch us having fun in
Thailand and I'm also carrying my 550d
with me I do have a 60d but I won't be
bringing that with me to Thailand just
in case something happens but this is
what my main camera and it's much
lighter cuz I've got a massive lens of
my new camera as well so so you've got
to have some have some tic-tacs although
it's kind of empty but just tastes good
and keeps my breath fresh and sunglasses
are an absolute must because when I wake
up in Dubai and I'm like Haggard I just
celebrity oh who is that the Beyonce no
but I just like these if I'm sleeping
and I just looked Haggard when I wake up
was like bright lipstick you look a lot
better so I carry these in here and
these are from ASOS I also carry
headphones of course listening to music
on my phone and then I carry some flat
shoes with me because I'm actually
wearing heels to the airport and the
only reason why I did that is because I
wanted my suitcase to be lighter so I
you can't see them my chunky wedges
instead and then I'm carrying a Marie
Claire with me just for entertainment I
always carry a diary and a couple of
pens as well just cuz I love taking
notes and having mine dumps the novel
that I'm Kate and I'm not a massive
reader like I only read for education
but rather than entertainment but um I
heard about this book the woman who went
to bed for a year so that would be
coming along with me and I'll start my
reading on the plane I carry some
deodorant with me and then it's really
weird I don't I'm wearing jeans what had
she not very comfortable on planes and
jeans so I've bought my completed maxi
skirt and I didn't want to wear the maxi
skirt and because it can be a bit you
know when you're walking up and down
stairs maxi skirts aren't the best
things and carrying suitcases but I just
roll it up into like a really tight ball
and then I will take off my jeans and
wear this on the plane being the person
that I am I'd basically got my passport
and travel money in one folder so I'm
bit worried my battery's a little low
but hopefully it doesn't die but I also
carry a head scarf with me because when
I'm like asleep on the plane I just
don't like my hair like rubbing on the
back of the plane seats because you
never know I know they've got these new
sheets and stuff that they put on but
it's a bit Rippey and not very nice so I
carry a scarf with me to wrap around my
head I know it might be a little bit
ghetto but you got to do what you got to
do and finally this is my makeup bag
then this is actually the only makeup
I'm taking with me to on the holiday but
key things in here a pair of eyelashes
and the pair that I'm wearing I've got
loads of lipsticks with me probably
about four lipsticks but who knows if
I'd wear them and then I've also got my
Maybelline falsies volume lashes I've
got my mac matchmaster than the 8.5 but
this isn't I've now got a new favorite
which is what I'm wearing which is the
Bobbi Brown in I believe it's a walnut
m7 something or the other
they always carry my concealer and a
darker eyeshadow and this is embark the
rest of it is a plethora of lip glosses
and lipsticks so guys that is my what's
in my holiday bag and it does zip up it
does the pup this bag is massive and it
really does get everything in it so I'm
very glad that I picked this for
February and I will definitely leave you
guys see how it does over the holiday
and hopefully it's not too heavy for me
so guys I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
