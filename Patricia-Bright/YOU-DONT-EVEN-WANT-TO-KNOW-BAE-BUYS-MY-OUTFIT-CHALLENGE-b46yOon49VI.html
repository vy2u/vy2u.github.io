this business that we needed it I like
it I actually like it
hello beautiful people welcomes in my
channel look so we happy not only am i
blonde we have a blondie with us as well
Michael is here hey wait ok I'm not
screaming anything here is this mental
more tonnage anyway Mike was here hey
how you been doing oh you have been
great thank you very much having fun
living life living in verse 9 and things
like that Michael has elements of stuff
happens that you don't understand what
he's saying if you think about that he's
really happy on the inside how is it
broken anyway so today we wanted to have
a little bit of a style of why are you
lovely basically I've always it styles
and fashions always in a strong point of
mine in third pitches adhere of Michael
to occur in urban religion listen
although having said that to be fair his
being with this one it has kind of
picked up a little bit improved your
Instagram I said I hate you just got
myself and I'll describe you said okay
off the top of my head I would say your
spiral words that come to mind would be
a little bit Street a little bit edgy
and fun grateful fun playful okay cool
yeah I mean you can add girly I'm quite
going in terms of my style
I collect arrested and I like stuff yeah
you are anything yes I'll describe my
style either novel I will describe my
style as non-existent
not that you don't house now but Michael
is not fast about these things so I I
kind of like to think of myself as like
Bruce Lee I don't really have the style
but I'm just like water I just mold and
flexible and just like kind of drop in
change now
well did I tell you what is there
something big like every time I go
shopping and then you do everything yeah
everybody goes up Michael empty without
additional style or care about these
things he would be quite quite sporty
because Mike was a very sporty guy and
so you know he likes you know some jeans
attracted that kind of thing you are a
sporty girl would that be correct yes I
guess so today I wanted us to do a
little style of challenge okay you guys
can decide who the winner of the photo
challenge all right we're going to go
for one garment outfit and one everyday
outfit yeah going to go we're going to
pick them up I'm going to get into her
he's going to get two for me well yeah
we're not going to see them until we
actually try them on
yeah and you guys can judge who makes an
extra bit above the door I would like to
know what tile is a bit on the other
side a second okay your size size RIT
anyway we're going to get to the shops
now and take you with us
okay we are in the car on route for the
shot rain engine ticking away like what
am I going to pick what kind of style

excited I'm gonna just going to pick you
up I'm going to make you look really
good and they make you look fresh all of
the likes of a complaining when I finish
this job watch this is my stomping
ground like the shop so good luck there
we're going to separate right right now
I've actually picked up quad are things
still a little bit confusing I'll be
honest I'm not quite sure how it's all
going to go together that's any problem
just pick random items so I don't know
how it's going to go together but this
is hope it works out Michael Jefferson
I'm going to get me one hate really
skinny and I wanted to prepare white
skinny TV so all the guys in the island
their whites imaging so yeah Michael's
actual genuine outfit along with the
crude perfect but one so that's how you
wear your trousers
oh my god Wow so we are finished the
shop now how was it for you so easy I
cannot wait to see what my dad for me
you ready I'm ready
bye guys so we are back from the shop
and in fact be the next day because
after shopping we were tired you know we
got a baby you might feel itchy
frightening things I had done I went the
top man if you can be top man elected
top shot job so i think opee's and heard
in Topshop and yeah I feel like I got
the really 19 think I wasn't nice big
lot I cannot wait to see what you've got
me yeah how much he did that spending
oh I heard about 250 pounds I probably
bought more than I would have done but I
wasn't quite sure set but let me get you
extra bit just in case yeah probably ran
through six pounds to be honest I spent
more I spent three hundred and forty
seven pounds but that's because I bought
three pairs of jeans so that wasn't
quite sure about Michaels jean side so
let's do this okay let's try it let me
try it on let's do a try
on hey you ready look at it straight on
okay so the first thing I got Michael
was skinny jeans and he hates skinny
jeans because he thinks he's got six
sides
I like to me I can do look okay I just
don't really suit me but yeah let's get
them in I thought on the side of 32
let's see they are tight okay this is
how far my leg can go yeah but what are
you doing kicking a ball yet in your
neighborhood you never going to be doing
squat a golden brown eye on but where
are you panting you need to be able to
move right just in life action yes I
can't squat that's about as low as I can
squat close enough stop the tire back
India alright
you're not playing football and then I
might not feel like they're being
squeezed in a vice
I think either an excellent pair of jean
michel over there excellent
I love them I like them but I won't be
keeping you in the next pair she bought
for me that's skinny but that 34 inch
waist is a little bit wider they don't
feel quite as tight quite as crushing
and actually don't mind these I don't
like them I don't want one initially
played there good cop stronger when I
make this kind why they just bring
though be hopeful I don't like this I
like another guy I got them here but
here I don't mind then bootcut next up I
got Michael just a plain white muscle
tee like this I small I wanted it to be
always bit of cute yeah I don't really
like this it's very thin
just doesn't look very good it feels
very cheap E and it wasn't cheap about
15 pounds for what plain white tea for
it's a big crap material expensive
you're not impressed my breasts even it
so I got in this Jackie it camel like
it's just got a little bit of man's work
to it it's a bit hot but what do you
think this yeah this is a lot about the
judges the seconds very nice good to do
a little very high no no babe no I don't
need to do that no
I know I did look spitting at the back
not my father but body of a Greek
cooking goddess chiseled out yeah a
wonderful project yeah fat jack ups on
ER
hi my name's Michael Adama it this
jacket fits really well okay okay okay
so the jacket was sixty pounds I like
the jacket think it looks nice he looks
good with this kind of outfit the
quality it feels decent the fit I
certainly feel like I could with one
size up but I don't think I've forgotten
sidewalk will agree to disagree on that
one my next look I got Michael another
pair of skinny jeans but these are
really light and then I got him a
t-shirt and I love the t-shirt because
it's got for a warning do you like it
anything you like you oh I can't hold
this get up let's get it on this is the
t-shirt kind of like very fitted quite
hugging to the what I love that I like
the flowery bits here and here and it's
quite cool but it was a nice I have to
jam tight these are taking two again I
normally foodtubers diva oh we did break
halfway through was he hard work these
are Tom I'm not wearing jeans at a five
on they're not that bad I basically
broke out into a sweat putting this
marriages they're very nice though
they're very nice but I actually quite
like the emoji but they look quite good
quite trendy little cut in the middle
can I move
actually these are kind of stretches I
can do my nice what oh it's uh huh
I like it right I've got this top of my
says I feel like I prefer this because
it's a bit looser I'm going to get
colorful I feel like think there's a
color that'll suit you let's find out
[Laughter]
Michael looks pretty with the look of
death like I feel like I'm wearing some
sort of push up or up my arms are about
to explode now we accept this is a bit
small okay that one is a bit
it's like me here I'm a medium I'm my
slim fit guy
what are you better pie all right my
turn now here's what I got the
petitioner first of all I got this
Cadillac and they shorts or skirts I'm
looking quite sure denim skirt I know
she likes to kind of like get him sure
his skirt acting and I quite liked it
because like these flowers on so try
these on I'm wearing six year old girl
I'm not gonna lie it isn't that bad it
isn't actually that bad I wouldn't have
picked this for myself but it actually
looks cute oh it does it's nicely but
good shape to it but nice colors on
these flowers I like it I actually like
it I was hating it out of the bag but he
didn't know what y'all next I got you
this t-shirt just indeed it which is
quite cool while I do this just classic
to reach drive again I like cooking a
bit more color and she doesn't usually
wear that much closer so I wanted to try
this on and see how it looked I mean
yeah it's nice it's an abbey bag t-shirt
yeah and garnishes color looks nice on
you very bright I get this in little
yellow hair and the red top you're never
gonna miss me I mean it's a nice t-shirt
did you have a plan for the outfit
Michael it's basically the result I want
to need to wear that we'd like to have a
parallel jogging pants pair that grey
sweats or black sweats or maybe some
leggings and just some casual trainers
I'll be honest with you I don't hate it
I love the little casual Andy that
earlier I like you in color but Center
base what we were in a minute this is a
good one this is the one program like
this season basically I like pink I
think you have good in this color it's
why I picked it it's like a whole body
piece do you think it was going to look
like this no I'm wait a minute I think
is that he's super cute I want to wear
like this I would put on some white
leggings or some form of trousers or
something like it
it's not addressed so maybe it's a
t-shirt well yeah you understand that
it's a t-shirt I understand it it looks
good that's why I think I got this as
well because I thought it would be quite
cool that you like this glow again it
says females of the future at this point
in time I suppose bought me for tuition
how did you found me try this
hold that
Wow also works about a t-shirt with a
nice baby powder blue kind of dress
that's good look dress that's good thing
oh okay come over you know what the
skirt is kind of cute is it me or does
it actually look all right together
anyway I think so subscribe I think I've
just on my new secret talent as a
stylist oh yeah it's got so super cute I
need it in the size up but I actually
really like the skirt I will ask you why
this not way yeah
all right that's two bits we got were I
know that you will put you that floral I
wasn't quite sure thing with the floral
thing is I saw to you and they all look
quite grand marriage so I do have a
feeling that these could be a bit grand
marriage but I wanted to give it a try
you know crazy I saw someone wearing
this dress at family wedding and I
thought it'd look really really nice if
I could cross over jumpsuit this isn't
my style man
this definitely isn't my normal style
but I do like this I do like though like
John sooner I like the back I like the
crisscross at the back thank you
I mean I would wear this to a wedding
I've actually seen this being one hour
wedding before and I thought that the
god really nice in it but I feel at
least now this one I think maybe in the
sale the pic oh yeah okay great we know
another table called maternal what do
you do like memory my husband maternal
and when are you due you know it's my
fate i I kind of like it I kind of like
it again I feel like II just wanna let
people know super casual see for LA I'm
feeling it babe I think it's cute
I'll just bring out a leg okay we're now
done oh ho I'm shocked by how well
Michael did be honest with you I'll do
it was quite lucky I think I did get
quite lucky but it's not just pure food
because I picked colors that I know you
90 I think brighter colors which you do
look good it but you're just sometimes a
bit too quite aware and I'm just dumb
when it comes to styling so I'll give
you credit where credit's due because
you actually created a look better
actually where and I actually like this
dress and the funny thing is that he
picks up I wouldn't normally pick but
when I wore it and that will improve in
this I like it so good job and also must
fail yeah what I feel about Topshop and
it's all very comfortable in terms of
the quality of the clothing you know
what you're going to get with Topshop
with always radiate apart from the one
t-shirt that we pick that was not okay
but yeah the part night was good you
know what I like most of the looks you
pick for me I just think the fit of them
was a bit too tight you've got things as
tight-fitting clothes and I'm not
comfortable in that it crushes it
constricts it makes me feel again so I
like your looks I just feel like I'd
probably return it in exchange it for
one size up okay guys I hope you enjoyed
that video I know we've never done
anything like this before but I probably
nice to bring Michael in show a bit men
styling as well and did you intervene
here I enjoyed it I post good fun well
until next time we'll see they are
comments below who do you think did this
better job when it came to styling I
have everything linked in the
description bar below if any of you guys
are looking for items plus some other
favorites from Topshop because they're
actually really good and yeah we'll see
you later bye oh my god what have we
done I've been ten thousand thousand of
