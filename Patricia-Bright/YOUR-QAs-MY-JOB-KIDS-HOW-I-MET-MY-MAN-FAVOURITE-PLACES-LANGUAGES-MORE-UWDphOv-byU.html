really excited to have and kids Gillette
my lips boo-boos my feet you just said
hey guys welcome to my channel today I'm
gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A it is about time I've
done a Q&amp;amp;A I think that every single
youtuber needs to do Q&amp;amp;A like every
quarter or like at least once a year I
think in my last few videos I said I was
going to do a Q&amp;amp;A but I out people on
Twitter and Facebook and this is like
the last day of August this is probably
going up the last day of August and I
want to start afresh for September
September is going to be completely like
fashion focused and style focused on my
channel so make sure you tune in but I
thought before that you know what Q&amp;amp;A
for this one girls and boys you know
what it's like
mm-hmm you need a cup of tea get your
cup of tea let's get comfortable I got a
lot of questions about me and my boy
work of her boyfriend who's now my
husband like when we met and stuff so
actually when did you know Mike was the
one and I did not really know that
Michael was the one till I don't know I
think there was a summer that we spent
apart and I think sorry nice he's over
there commenting but the summer that we
spent apart I think that was when I felt
that right okay you know what
this is yeah he's definitely the one and
actually we broke up like yeah I'm gonna
shed so we broke up for like six months
ish maybe longer and I saw someone else
for a period of time not a long bit like
three weeks or something right and I
think at that point in time I was like
no like I want my man back and I think
that was definitely something that
showed me that Mike was the one what
countries have I traveled to I have been
to going to real it off I have been to
Singapore Malaysia barley Nigeria Italy
Spain Malta um North America Hong Kong
Thailand Portugal I love it I have been
to France I finally been to France and
that's it and then my next trip is
actually going to be to Greece I'm going
to Santorini finally
wait what's my ideal day I'm lazy
sitting at home food being cooked for me
and you know watching you know Breaking
Bad right now I'm watching Breaking Bad
now no I'm really really weird we're
watching it together though and that's
it really and some white chocolate
perfect day so the next question is from
I should say say everyone's name I'm
really sorry that a similar four day
says what do you Mike do work wise and
do you guys see yourself doing the same
things ten years time if not what would
you like to be doing so this is a
question that I've been asked quite a
lot of all the questions is basically
what am i doing now so I am full-time
working for myself in the world or kind
of YouTube and advertising media and all
that kind of stuff so for some of you
guys who don't know when I came on here
I was actually interning and at a bank
and I used to work in investment banking
I used to work at Merrill Lynch I can
say where I worked now I used to work at
Merrill Lynch I also worked at Deloitte
Consulting as well like I was still you
know uploading and all that kind of
stuff but I think that you know
sometimes you have to be there's an
opportunity before me and I've got my
career like kind of under my belt that
you know what sometimes you have to like
follow your passions and what you really
love to do but so I am you know full
time YouTube blog in again I work with
brands and I do some advisory stuff and
some more consulting stuff in that sense
but that's what I do people ask a lot
about what Michael does he is a
physiotherapist and he works at a
hospital full-time yeah he did and then
he works with outpatient so could be
from stroke people who've had a stroke
to people who've broken bones to people
who need just rehabilitation after
something has happened to their physical
bodies and do I see myself doing the
same thing in 10 years time hopefully I
love being able to be self-employed and
doing what I do here and the other stuff
I do are able to work more in the
creative space and I do wish I could do
this forever do you plan on having kids
and how many's this is the question this
is the question I don't if you guys are
following me on my vlog channel everyone
asked that all the time like when you
have kids help you
key where are you having kids kids be
pregnant I'm not pregnant guys yes I
want kids I want three kids I want two
girls and a boy
like that's my dream I really really
want three kids oh I really want three
kids and I plan on a we plan on having
them I don't know to be honest with you
when we're ready like right now I love
traveling I love being quite quite free
at the moment and I think you know if
you have kids it's like okay it's that
stage of life I don't feel like we're at
that stage of life just yet but I'm
really excited to have kids what would
you name your children and I'm gonna be
honest with you I like traditional names
I'm so Nigerian that I love really
traditional English names I like my
sister's name's Maureen you guys know
that but I like Victoria and I like
grace grace grace my daughter's name
would definitely be grace my son's name
well fingers crossed so you don't know
my son's oh I don't know what my son's
name would be my hair that's crazy so
guys my son's name would be I think I
was Jeremiah or something like that as
Joseph I think was Joseph was the name
that I liked for son but who knows that
I might change change on the Dame and
then call my child Rose how did you
break into the fashion career world what
would it really say that I'm in the
fashion career world as it stands I do
fashion and beauty but YouTube and
blogging is a great outlet to be noticed
by people within the fashion industry
when I went to university my first like
I went in to do international fashion
marketing as a degree and I literally
hated the course and I found out like
what people earn in fashion and as I I
don't want to work in fashion and that's
when I did accounting and Finance so I
like being an outsider in in this
industry Anna Cristina Cardozo says you
love to read what are your favorite
inspirational motivational books seven
Habits of Highly Effective People I've
mentioned this many many times I have
read Rich Dad Poor Dad I really like it
what other books that I've been reading
I've really enjoyed recently I read lean
in by Sheryl Sandberg we sit
me there is a really good book you know
when I remember it I put in the
description bar below T joe says
Patricia please will you answer my
question about blogging what inspired
you to blog and how long did it take you
to build a decent following well what
inspired me to blog was other people I
was a student at uni and I was really
bored and I think I used to go out a lot
like I was a full blown raver three
times a week
oh yeah how cool right well that's I
stayed slim and I remember I was trying
to look for like a beauty look was it a
beauty look all's I know I was really
into hair I was really really into like
hair and hair growth and that kind of
thing and then I used to learn this
forum where people talked about hair and
then some of the girls will post on
YouTube and then I found more more
people on YouTube and then as I said I
fell in love and I had to do YouTube I
literally had to do YouTube and I was
just hooked ever since and I was just
inspired by all these other people doing
it it made me really want to do it it
has taken me I've been doing blogging
for over three years so I think I'm like
year four year five now of how long I've
been doing YouTube I've only been doing
blogging for about one year but YouTube
about four years and in regards to
following I have no idea
that when I started I thought I was
getting views the views are me view my
own video like I was getting four or
five users like wow who are these people
it was me
okay but I think just more and more it
grew I know it's really hard in our days
but I would my key piece of advice for
anyone who wants to do it is actually to
try and do videos with other people who
are at the same level or that you share
a similar interest with what's your most
sexiest thing my class about you that's
quite a creepy question Mostafa and
what's the sexiest thing Mike loves
about me I think it would probably be my
lips G Laghman lips people do like my
lips my feet he's just said aquatic
range what's the most embarrassing thing
that has ever happened to you the most
embarrassing thing I probably wouldn't
want to share it with you but okay okay
okay let's get like right Akane right
we're getting serious I'm putting the
cup of tea down Giggsy
okay that's from Emma Alexandra I can
take two stories I talked one of them
before what it was very embarrassing
the first story was when I was at uni
and I was like revising for like finals
and like I was in the library you know
when it's like when everyone's in the
library like Shh everyone get really
quiet and everyone's really serious I
was really really serious but I like
listening to music really really loud
like I put my headphones in and there's
this song by Jay but the beginning of
the son goes oh when they get freaky I
wanna get freaky and I was like I
plugged it in and I was like why can't I
hear this my turn the volume up really
really loud right why can't I hear this
and I just realized everybody in the
library was looking at me because my
headphones were not plugged in and they
could all hear that I wanted to get
freaky while we were all studying for
our finals so that was very embarrassing
and my second embarrassing story I think
is in regards to when I first visited
Nigeria as a child and I was young so
you guys can let me just let this one go
but I really needed to use the loo and
like number two in the loo and we were
in a village and I'm like I don't want
to use the long drop like it was genuine
long drop days like you know if you know
what long draw is it's like hole in the
ground toilet and I like I can't use I
was one of those snobby kids
there's British kids you come to Africa
is like oh my god is it and then I had
to let it out and yeah that was really
embarrassing and it was okay put it in
her bestie and Charlie says if you have
to wear one color for the rest of your
life what color would it be and why that
color would be black and because I find
black to be really flattering like I
don't know I find it just makes me look
nice it contrasts really nicely with
like my brown skin and I feel sexy in
black so I'll definitely wear black and
that's question is who is your
photographer yes it is Mike Mike is my
photographer that is from Samar Alamosa
hi Pat I'd like to know where you find
the inspiration for your fashion looks
for blog posts and vids that's a really
good question and I
get a lot of inspiration from other
bloggers my favorites are Ken's our
Angelica Blake Shirley Sammy who else
the way like glitz &amp;amp; glam
there's Melissa's wardrobe there's so
many girls that I just like to look at
and it just gives me ideas for styles
and sometimes I don't believe that
there's anything new Under the Sun and I
don't think people copy I think they can
draw inspiration and so you know what I
like the way that worked on her I'm
gonna make that work on myself but you
know make sure you follow me on
instagram guys I try to post a lot on
there and my Facebook and my Twitter Oh
Carrie Bradshaw which perfume do I'm
actually hot guys I'm not a perfume girl
I'm really not a perfume girl I just
used whatever perfume is to reach but I
think it's Marc Jacobs Daisy
I love the bottle that's what's
currently in my room a question from a
sorry me says how did you meet Mike and
what was your first date with him like
okay and I have told this story before
but Mike used to be a bouncer and he
used to be a doorway doorman at subway
subway they're like restaurant chains
because it used to be next to a club so
we me and my friend were like staggering
ah we were walking out of the club and
we saw a guy inside Subway that we knew
I know your waiters into subway when I
carry on another chatting you know what
it's like after after a club night
you're a little bit happy and they were
in there like well why don't you wait
for us we'll be done real soon and we'll
take you home so I'd like again I didn't
know who what Mike was at the time and
my friend knew the other guy who was
with him and then we got into Mike's car
and Mike drove us all home and is that
all thanks a lot my form like dropping
us home and he lived with he lived with
my best friend's brother and then
that was it and then finally like the
trance encounter with the numbers
exchanging and stuff was that we were
all out a club together we left the club
and like there's a whole bunch of guys
who try to write chat up the Gaza after
words and they might came out grabbed me
from the middle of this crowd fine man
lifted me over his shoulder I went
running down the street my friend fell
out my pocket and then he caught it and
he said if you want your phone back you
have to give me your phone number and
that's how it all began and that was
quite a that was quite a major move
coming from this guy but yeah and what
was your first day why am i smiling okay
what was your first date with him like
um it was really cool we went to go play
pool I was rubbish I think know what I
was doing and he was wearing remember he
was wearing a yellow t-shirt a khaki
jacket khaki trousers and like some
shell trailers like it wasn't the best
dresses yet fashions it's like his
fashion sense wasn't all that then but
law was mine I look back on it and it
was really good I was really shy at the
time but yeah Jessica how well says what
are your favorite jeans to wear and
tostÃ£o high-waisted skinny jeans like
that's such an easy question to ask I'm
actually going to do a style video with
M&amp;amp;S which is high-waisted skinny jeans
they are my favorite they're really
flattering for every single goal of
every single shape Camilla Osbourne says
how do you manage inactive YouTube
channel work again I've mentioned that
now I am full-time doing this well I've
been balancing this for like four or
five years it's like second nature to me
but the key thing is that I work on the
weekend so I shoot on Saturdays I don't
do anything on Sunday but I do shoots on
Saturdays I wake up earlier I do stuff
after work you know depending on what I
doing I just fit it into my whole
lifestyle neo says what do you do to
make sure you wake up in good time on a
morning when you're knackered or
overworked any tips no I need tips I
need tips on this right I am the worst
when it comes to rolling out of bed like
I've got worse I don't know why I like
my bed just feels like there's so so
good Mademoiselle Gloria says say some
words in french bonjour je m'appelle
Petrus
how'd I say I love you should ten that's
it guys the blue honey says what hair
color would you dye your hair I really
want to dye my hair like red my
extensions red or like pink at the ends
but because of my skin tone I've come a
bit funny when it comes to colors cuz
they can look a little bit on me but
I've seen gods do it really really well
is it possible that you do a tag video
with your mum that's a very good idea I
might see if I can get mummy on here
she's a lot she's worse than me so I
don't know like she's just so
embarrassing sometimes but I love my mum
she's amazing okay one last question how
do you stay so fabulous all the time
like you're always on point you guys see
me when I am like on video right you
guys probably don't watch my vlog
channel where I look crazy right at the
time like I think 70% of the time I look
like a madwoman and like 30% of the time
I film and I take pictures I look good
and I'm okay with that it's alright it's
out good what is your biggest dream my
biggest dream is that I'm able to impact
people in a positive way like all the
time with my words and my deeds and help
them transform their lives it's a big
dream but that you know dream world
peace like obviously that's a good dream
tag this says who would be your dream
collabo be with it will probably be with
like a celebrity it'd probably be like
Oprah or I thought of that not probably
not allowed to say this I'm not big
Beyonce fan right I know you all love
her and their loads of people be her
don't come for me but I still respect
her so I would love to have like Beyonce
I have a chat with her and because I
like there's something about her talent
that is ridiculous and that's it really
crosses up to me what is your favorite
sneakers comment anything on my keys
growing up I just never wore sneakers
when my parents were not buying them for
me but - I had huge huge feet and I just
look like stupid but now I've not had to
make it work for me so I love them okay
chichi asks how did you know what you
wanted to do at you
I'll be honest with you I didn't make an
informed decision about what I wanted to
do at uni I was like I like fashion
let me find what fashion courses I'm
available and I chose international
fashion marketing because it seemed to
be the only one that had a sense of
business and fashion do I regret it yes
because I think I didn't do enough for
research but I changed afterwards and I
did accounting and Finance the reason
why the only reason why I did it counted
in finance because when I had was on the
fashion course there was an accounting
module and I was really good at it I was
just really good at yeah I know I
shouldn't pose but I got like 80%
without even trying I thought maybe I do
accounting then and I thought there's
more money in accounting let's go into
accounting if you weren't doing what
you're doing now what do you think you
would be doing I would be working in a
really cool bank with like a really cool
fun bank with like a fun team and doing
business analysis going to lots of
meetings I love doing what I was don't
get me wrong I love doing what I was
doing um and I like in my last job I
have like the best team and the I was in
the best company and yeah I was with an
amazing team doing some great great work
and I'm a geek I don't if you guys don't
know this I love Excel I love
spreadsheets I like documentation I like
the process so I will probably still be
doing that as well but I think how to
always have something to do a fashion on
the side noisy said what are some of
your favorite things about the fall
season wearing moves like this wearing
black wearing jackets layering fur curly
hair boot food tea pies leaves red
orange just love it like I was so
excited about fall like make sure you
check out my blog as well Patricia right

everything like I'm already in full

want to do when you retire you're
retired well I'm probably going to be
about 90 whether it's how I retired so
in a 90 I'd like not to be in a
wheelchair I'd like to have a lot of my
eyesight doesn't need to be all there

great-grandchildren that's what I'll do

girl Celine arts put Patricia what
inspires you people places book films

oh I'm inspired so many things I'm
inspired mainly by people I'm inspired
by travel a lot like glittery that's why
I think I travel so much because I love
and that's why I go to Asia a lot but
then I love the culture when you go to
somewhere that's kind of completely out
of your own culture Bureau arts what
would you say the best way to kickstart
your own blog take some pictures like
then this is what I advise anyone who
wants to get into YouTube or anything
like that just do it like literally you
don't even need like big big cameras and
stuff like that well maybe nowadays you
do but talk about what you're passionate
about right and just do a passion from
your heart share with your friends and
family and you might just get the ball
rolling like that okay guys so those are
a lot of the questions that I can get
through for now I probably will do
another Q&amp;amp;A so leave any other questions
that you have but I really hope that you
