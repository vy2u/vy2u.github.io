video answered yes video questions
answered and this is gonna be jobs
career and university related so what
course did you study and what area that
you work in
I studied accounting and finance for
three years I also did study accounting
accounting international fashion
marketing for a year however I did not
complete that course but I did finish
the first year whatever do you work in I
work for an investment bank and I'm a
business analyst what do I do for a
living I work I'm a business analyst so
I analyze business needs and stuff like
that um um did I enjoy uni do I think
it's worth going yes I loved uni I loved
what you learned you grow up so much you
get out of what you're used to you see
the world you meet people from all over
the world and I would advise anyone even
if you don't like studying yeah you need
to go because you build up so many
networks it's just such an amazing
experience what subjects that I did is
do in school well I did bio biology
chemistry Business Studies and
psychology I dropped chemistry because I
didn't like it but I did love biology I
was quite good as well what was I doing
in New York were you working
I was the company I work for sent us out
to New York to Train train so I think
it's one of their ways of kind of
wrapping us in showing us the good life
making us work for our money now though
when I finished my degree did take me
long to get a job no it didn't take me
long because I had already applied for
my internship I done an internship
previously and I had gotten offer so I
knew that I had that offer my advice for
anyone if you were in your first year
your second year apply for summer
programs apply for internships get as
much experience under your belt as you
can because it's really going to help
you what have you got that someone else
doesn't have do I mean who you got a
first and where's your experience what
have you done show you're tenacious and
I think that's really really important
how did I get into the industry I work
in I did
internship I applied on to the graduate
program I went to networking events my
advice for others trying to get into
Investment Banking Network know people
find out names send out emails begi
okay it's as simple as that what you
needed I goat I went to Manchester
Metropolitan University would I
recommend it I would recommend going up
north to Manchester for University
Manchester is a very good one Manchester
Met is you know it's alright
is it multicultural City yes but it's
not as multicultural as London but it's
good to get out you know I mean mixed up
with people do I have any advice for
recent graduates getting into the job
market and my advice would be be
tenacious and don't give up send out an
email to everyone get some work on your
CV volunteer call count companies and
say hi I'm looking for some experience I
will come and work for a day can I do
some shadowing I just want to help out
go and do that and at least you could
put on your CV you know I spent a day at
this company if you even contact you
know CEOs or heads of companies they'll
be they'll give you the time of day
because these people love talking okay
so you know do that and just don't give
up my friend just got a job with one of
the top five law firms in the world she
applied four times and was rejected but
she got a job now so just don't give up
guys and you know it's hard out there
but you'll be alright so guys that is my
jobs and career questions answered hope
