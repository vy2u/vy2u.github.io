am doing a Q &amp;amp; A I feel like it's been
like almost a year since I lost on the
Q&amp;amp;A and I feel like it's about time that
I do one for you or I have lots of new
subscribers and nonsubscribers and I'm
sure there's lots of questions that lots
of people have and the Sun is going in
and out but I'm not even gonna stress
about that for those of you guys who
film and especially those of you who use
natural light you will understand the
aggro of using a window and then clouds
but this is England I tried to film this
makeup look and it would just rip from
grey to black to whack as I said you
know what forget it
I'm gonna use my life another day and
redo this tutorial but yeah now I'm
gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A
stop complaining Patricia it has lots of
people on Instagram on on Twitter and
I'm actually like it's Sunday right now
it's Sunday morning I'm gonna edit it
and upload it and get it out to you
right now and this is how you know this
is fresh this is not one of those who
recorded four weeks ago kind of videos
so I'm just gonna go straight through my
Instagram account and just read all your
questions that you've got there's like
literally about 400 over here and then
there's a bunch over or my Twitter as
well they can Vita EXO has asked me how
do you deal with overprotective parents
growing up my parents are super
overprotective I'll be honest with you
I'm Nigerian I've components I'm very
very protective kind of roll with it you
kind of count your hours till you're out
of the house be respectful to your
parents and yeah you can kind of sneak
out here and there but be careful
because if you get catch out will hurt
you don't want that happening NAIOP ups
are you more of a starter and a mains
person or a mains and a dessert person
that is such a good question because you
know I love my food and I'm definitely a
starter and amazed I don't really have a
sweet tooth it's been growing but you
know give me some chicken any day or a
salad any day and that will always be my
favorite option joke ro - Oscar ups me
who is my Stine inspiration I don't
currently have a specific style
inspiration
I love bloggers and my favorite bloggers
probably like Angela
blick right now she's just amazing and
flawless and I really like a blog local
Gary pepper as well and I mean all of
the girls from the UK I feel like
everyone's got their own sense of style
that it's really really unique and
interesting and I just like people who
play with their style don't get caught
up in everything countdown for ask me is
social media my full-time job and do I
have a 9 to 5 so I said this in my last
Q&amp;amp;A I do not have a 9 to 5 per se but I
probably work from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.
nowadays I have my own businesses that I
run and I also do the YouTube channel as
well so I have the flexibility to shoot
videos on a regular basis but I have
multiple streams of income one day I'm
gonna do a series on that maybe over my
blog to be honest where I get super
serious Patricia serious so that I can
help you guys to like really maximize
your earnings and how you live your life
so I do do YouTube I have a lot of other
things that you also do Abigail this
snares ask me what is my hair care
routine I'm gonna do a full hair clay
routine if you guys don't know I wear
you parts where I wear weaves and my
hair is natural but I blow-dry my hair
because I have very coarse hair and it
just gets really tangled and I like wear
my hair in like a little bun a lot of
the time and maybe I'll show you you
like my bun head at some point in time
I've done it on my snapchat a couple of
times and I wash in condition probably
once a week happy girl said what makeup
should I wear for secondary school or
college none
our vaseline vaseline was my only makeup
but I realized what nowadays you got
Kylie Jenner to look up to look at this
girl she's 17 she's older than me so I
feel like it's hard out here if you're
young because the benchmark is so high
but honestly you don't have to do that
don't start aging your skin when you're
16 like relax yourself
just put some moisturizer on come and
Vaseline okay live your life a little
bit be young it's okay
babban Jurek arts are you am i thinking
about having a baby this is the most
popular question of course all my social
media and the
say that is none of your business and
I'm Jackie and I'm Jacob and I
definitely want children I'm not in a
rush to have children if I'd be
completely honest with you because we
want to travel more we're going to the
movies and all that kind of good stuff
like and I love my life right now and it
sounds really selfish it's like driving
to bring a child in right now the way my
life is and I work to be more stable and
not not traveling so much before I have
a baby but yeah I definitely want to
have children I can't wait to look a
little boy look girl twins I want lots
of children so yes we are happy Marvel
asked me is the struggle real yes Abby
the struggle is always real and he's my
friend by the way
that's strong yet soft woman actually
what are my dues and doze of date in
like no kissing holding hands cuddling
and it calls off the ten o'clock and I
thought this is really interesting and I
think because I'm in a comfortable
relationship all of that stuff goes out
the window like you don't care you could
kiss your card oh yeah your call
whenever you feel like it you call at
2:00 p.m. you wake the person up if you
feel like it and that's what happens
when you're in a comfortable
relationship but I know that when you're
like starting out you have to kind of be
careful because you kind of have to
protect your own self however I don't
think it's too good to over strategize
and I think you should really do
anything that you know that you're gonna
feel comfortable with yourself in the
long run the guy's gonna be a douche a
guy's gonna be a douche and I don't
think it's gonna be based on all the
little things you do or don't do so as
long as you feel comfortable in the
decisions that you're making so if you
don't feel like kissing him anytime soon
that is your prerogative and if he
disappears off but you feel comfortable
in where you stand that's what's the
most important thing is I can't see the
point in strategizing if you want to
answer his call answer it's cool like as
simple as that grated and crazy blob
asked me when did I start wearing makeup
and genuinely I started wearing makeup
when I was probably about 20 and I was
not a big makeup person and when I was
younger I've made it very clear Vaseline
was my makeup and actually it was only
when I got into YouTube that I really
I'd wear makeup even when I was unit at
uni I never wore foundation I never
owned a foundation and I just wore like
mascara I've had just the worst looking
brows and then when I got into like yet
got into YouTube I started doing all the
concealer and just looking like some
flipping camera I just feel terrible but
it was never a big big makeup wearer
because I just had really good skin but
back in the day I think makeup plays a
part but yeah when I was about 19 20
their vocabulary actually what is my
life goal like Beyonce said to be happy
and what do you do to make it come true
I think that's so interesting to expand
on that I think and I think it's really
important to make an impact one of my
life goals is to make impact in a
positive way and I think one of the
things I really want to do is to
encourage gods and women that there are
alternative routes to success and being
the best them without having to
necessarily be like that what's
considered cool consider popular
especially for the alternative gods who
aren't necessarily the most perfect
according to you know the world and the
media but that doesn't stop you you're
not invisible and I feel like that's
where my heart really really is and what
I want to do and I think that life is
great when you're giving back life is
not about what you can get when it's
also about what you can give and you're
finally said anyone who's successful
it's all about how much they can give
back so I always really give back in my
life and what can I do to make it come
true well being oh the ultimate true to
myself it's how I do that and by if I
feel something and I'm pushed by
something then I do it one thing I know
about me is that you can't stop me
I do what I feel like doing when I feel
like doing - like doing it and I think
the more true I am to myself the more
I'm able to achieve my life goals cecily
said how does it feel to have someone in
your life for so long and to think
they're talking about my partner who
we've now been together almost eight
going on nine years so we met when we're
quite
and and it feels good it feels like it
feels like breathing it feels like
natural and I think there's nothing like
the comfort of having someone who's like
your flesh and your blood to like be
there at any moment you know you get to
share a burden we share a thought with
and I thats why I think love is such a
beautiful thing and relationship it's
such a beautiful thing and I think you
continue to make the choice to make it
work and I think it's really important
to do that mrs. sherry said Patricia how
to keep the flames going on in a
marriage that is so funny you know not
getting into too much detail the flames
of passion do need to continue burning
they're not as hot and as flame me as
they were you know when you're 19
however I think that I'm spending a lot
of time with each other communicating
with each other being honest with each
other and setting time aside and to
connect is really really important
because you can get so carried away
we're doing everything else and that is
it being a very comfortable relationship
but you don't get the opportunity to
watch the flame be that very
conversation or going out and eating or
be it you know you know intimately and
all that good stuff but setting time is
ecent sure okay
I'm connecting spiritually I think
that's really important hair dear arts
me how do I keep my hair so flexible how
am I able to wear my extensions in a
flexible way I might do a video where I
show that my hair pattern and stuff like
that but basically I have a track that
goes all across that way and a closure
and they do it like that which means I
can flip it back flip it forward flip it
in the middle because I do a track
straight across and it means that when I
have all my like edges and stuff out I
can flip it back easily and you don't
have to see it on my trucks some days
you can but I don't really care that
much to be honest with you Pera not Caro
asked me any good cheap makeup brands I
can recommend
I don't believe in cheap products but I
love the super drug beat B range and I
love to be even Foundation and I've
sleek it was a great starter for me when
I first started out with makeup and all
Jordana there's that's amazing Rae gave
me a bunch of stuff when I was in the
you
and the lipsticks are on point Patricia
what are your tips are great skin I
really believe that having a skin care
routine is essential I feel like you
know once I got a bit older my skin
definitely requires work back in the day
I could let you just use Vaseline that
seems clearly my favorite thing right
Vaseline and I look good I look smooth
as a baby's bottom my skin was even
everything but the older that I got it's
not been the same kind I know that I
wear more makeup as well and I think
that genuinely has a big impact on skin
if I'd be truly truly honest with you
and keeping your face nice and
moisturized and always taking your
makeup off I'm gonna do a whole skincare
routine really really soon so grant
actually what made me start doing and
YouTube videos and I was basically an
accountant find that student who was
bored and I used to go out a lot and I
used to be into haircare that's why so I
had a haircut channel age ago I used to
be like obsessed I used to read forums
on hair
I see reforms on skin like I was very
very obsessed so lots of girls on these
forums would post their videos onto
YouTube and then I found the videos and
I found my country's choice and I found
Michelle Phan and I just say what is
this I want to be part of this and then
I just got involved like I was Ritchie
in awe of everything that I saw and it
just really inspired me just to get
connected I did YouTube for three years
about a penny and but I was so
passionate about it I loved it so yeah
where do I see myself in ten years
in ten years I see myself with three
baby for my husband still slim and trim
and sexy and like a house in in Surrey
of that land and cows Ewok 76 said if I
could only live in one place for the
rest of my life where would it be it
would be London I am in London girl
through and through the only thing I
wish was that the weather was better I
feel like London is like just the most
diverse and beautiful place where if you
can work hard you can actually do very
very well I do not feel like I mean
there's prejudice any everywhere but I
really feel like here
you can overcome that Gabriela monkey
asked me about my job and my career
story will I ever talk about it of
course I will
I could tell you all about what I've
done where I've done in stuff like that
so maybe I'll do it a proper video in
this I think it's a really good idea
because I'm I'm really a geek and a
professional at heart but I talk about
that when they feel as also how do you
stay real after you go big well what's
the definition of big right and then
what's the definition of real I think
now and I think this person was really
nice to say that I come across as really
down-to-earth and really the same the
reality is that you are who you are and
you know it's rude I'm not someone who
can fake things very much it's just not
my my cup of tea and I think that
honesty is is the way tip to success to
bonus and I think that some people say
like nice guys finish last but I don't
believe that I've met so many people
I've met millionaires and people who
sold companies and people who are
extremely successful and the one thing
I've noticed in the like the trend and
people who are extremely successful a
really good and genuine heart a genuine
joy and a genuine happiness and a desire
to help others so I've had people who've
been wanting to help me you know get
better doing things to me on the side
and these are people who are extremely
successful people who are considered to
be Mentors
and I'm just like wow and I think it's
so important to stay grounded in
anything that you do because you've got
to pay it forward you know because
that's what people do to you so I think
it's really important to be really real
to Brenes I don't know any other way to
be so yeah was Michael supportive of me
when I first started doing YouTube and
yes he thought it was a bit weird but he
was always like wow for sure you're
doing amazing it and he's literally my
number one fan so he's always been very
supportive della mill vein said if I had
to choose a bad breath or head lice for
the rest of my life
what would I choose head lice because
you can always get you know
get those that comb and get the
headlights out or just well wig however
if you've got bad breath or halitosis
you're just gonna be having people
flying left right and centre away from
you and nobody wants that
was I ever every child I was cheeky I
was never rude because I would have got
scrapped into 1974 but I was cheeky yeah
and a little bit strong-willed my mum
never called me bad she never called me
rude she just said I'm a strong-willed
child namaste
hang out ask me do I ever feel pressure
from other social media attention that I
get definitely I would be lying if I
said that this world doesn't have an
impact on the way you feel about
yourself and makes you feel so
self-conscious that when I go out and
about nowadays and when people see me
and actually a horrible situation happen
I was having a really emotional phone
call something had happened and my I was
in the station like I was virtually like
on on the verge of tears I was having
quite an intense conversation and at
that point in time lo and behold someone
spotted me I was like no no I'm so sorry
no like crying like some idiot and it's
like you have to be on but I just
couldn't be on because I'm tendineae I'm
a human and I have situations that I
have to deal with like everybody else in
the world and it is it is a lot of
pressure I mean I love it and I
appreciate it but I really like people
to understand that we are all human
beings
Nancy asked me what was my teenage life
like did I have strict parents growing
up so no sleepovers and all that good
stuff
yes my parents were strict for sure but
that's when it's like when your Nigerian
and there was definitely no sleep overs
my mom's they sleep over where you have
your own bed why are you sleeping in
somebody else's bed no and and it did
have one sleepover and it happened at my
house and that was it so but I really
appreciate the fact that my parents are
strict I feel like it really kept me out
of a lot of problems that could have
befell me but didn't mean and love this
question would you rather be a man or
stay a woman I would love to try being a
man for a day I think being a man would
be like really good fun and I want to
see the difference in the way
that men are treated then women in life
and maybe I want to see what it's like
with the different hormones and not
having female hormones and not being as
emotional as I am and I feel like my
emotions are because I'm a woman or
because I'm crazy and it's my hair
extensions like coming out for those of
you who don't know I do have a line of
hair extensions going out we are
actually shooting the campaign shots
this week it's going to be amazing it
should be coming out hopefully by the
end of July but I'll keep you all in the
loop I'm so so so excited about it it's
been a long time coming but I just
wanted to do it the right way so yeah
what am I can I ever visit my jira of
course one day I hope to go this
December finally it's been a long time
my old assistant lives up there if you
guys don't know that so I literally
cannot wait to go Solomon asked me is
being a youtuber always so glam and did
you change your job because it
the pay was better well yes I'm glad
right now because I'm sitting in front
of the camera with my makeup on right if
you ever saw what I'd look like prior to
this then no right when you're editing
at one o'clock in the morning then no
however do I absolutely love doing this
the answer to that is yes do I get to go
to really cool places definitely I do do
I get said some really cool things to
try out definitely for sure and so it's
a really good balance but it's hard work
because you do work for yourself and you
have to be self-motivated and you need
to get the balance really really right
did it fit when I left my job no it
didn't pay better than my job and
however I could see so much opportunity
and what I was doing that I was like
well you know I'm gonna make this work
what was my first job I mean so I like
this question and I think about when I
was younger and stuff okay my first job
I used to do I mean I'm working since I
was like three but my first first job I
think it was when I was delivering
better wear catalogs this was like child
labor okay my neighbor he used to like
run this catalog thing he would get like
all the kids on the estate or in the
area they basically put all these
catalogs through people's doors then
dropping off the goods that people
ordered that was my first rest job
and then after that I got a job in Coast
in House of Fraser when I was 16 and I
was a sales assistant and then I worked
at post and Oasis for years and all
throughout school and university until I
kind of was able to find myself more
until I got my actual final job job I
never talked about my dad I have a
lovely lovely amazing dad who but I
don't want to show my dad and on camera
that much because I just don't feel like
showing my dad you guys see my mom she's
crazy she likes to be in front of the
camera my mom and dad are still together
they're very nice he's very very funny
but it's not about putting my dad on the
internet that'd be really real of you
somebody asked me hardly of get a
mortgage at such a young age I got a
mortgage when I was 24 um literally
gonna do it like when I read these
questions I feel like I have to do
something like really really serious for
you guys if you want to see kind of
money series life series go go get what
you want series that makes no sense and
let me know in the comments it's about
to go down I think I'm gonna create a
new channel anyway where I do all that
kind of good really gritty stuff to
really help you guys have been empower
you guys I think is so important what is
my faith I am a practicing Christian
somebody asked me do my husband pray
together read the Bible of course we do
the family that prays together stays
together stand by that and for sure I do
go to church not all the time not every
week and but I did I love I hop Kansas
City I will share the link I mean
they've got the most awesome prayer room
and love the ethos of the church some
people don't like it but I know
everyone's always got something to say
but if you are ever trying to get a you
know build a relationship with God or
just get some understanding they've got
some really good sermons and articles
that I like anything that is practical
and I feel like if you want to learn
about prayer as suffering that they've
got things and articles and steps to
help you with pray like oh my faith is a
big part of my life and I tried to walk
in the way that really connects in my
faith if I could tell my 18 year old
self something it would be
don't worry things are gonna get amazing
and don't think about boy so much about
actually what is my favorite summer
snack and it's a blue berries I try to
eat lots and lots of fruit because I'm
starting to develop a sweet tooth but
yeah blueberries are delicious and I
find them they just make me feel good
when I have them how do I deal with
people disapproving with interracial
relationships I do not get disapproval
unless it's on the internet it's so
weird that in real life nobody seems to
care but on the internet and and I think
that's because it's just a global
audience people care a lot and to be
honest the internet doesn't define my
real life so it doesn't really make any
difference to me whatsoever did I go to
university and what did I do
yes I went to university I studied
accounting and finance if I could eat
only one food item for the rest of my
life what it would be it would be rice
oh my gosh there's so many questions
yeah I feel like I need to do a Q&amp;amp;A
right series like once a month because
I've got more questions here than I can
actually answer I've really been doing
this almost an hour right now I'm gonna
edit it down to like 20 minutes or
something so we're gonna stop the Q&amp;amp;A
right here right there and if you have
any more questions I'm gonna make you
and these a regular thing so guys thank
you so much for watching and I'll catch
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
