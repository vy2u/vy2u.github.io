Happy New Year yay welcome to 2014 where
all your dreams will be made I hope you
guys had an amazing festive season and
stuff like that I literally have been
off line well kind of offline and I've
been addicted to Game of Thrones which
literally I bought the box set and I
couldn't stop watching it like you just
kept going and going going but I don't
want her from has been another video but
yes welcome to 2014
so today the last video I said I wanted
to do a Q&amp;amp;A and I wanted to do arts path
because the thing that I truly enjoyed
the most when I do these videos is
basically having the chance to just chat
with you guys and deal the topical stuff
like lots of people say they're like
auntie Patricia like I thought they were
like old but you're not about taking me
so I'm gonna do an arts pack today
mostly what she sent me messages on
facebook which is really cool
but I'm gonna answer the Twitter
questions first I do my hair myself
basically I wear a weaves I sometimes
wear wigs I sometimes wear clip-ins
I just wear what works for me and I know
a lot of people asked about how it looks
so natural rich I think it's all about
the way that you do it I always leave
like most the majority of the front of
my hair and stuff so it doesn't look
like Wiggy and I just leave my leave out
out and like just straighten on top of
it once a week so for those of you of
state sides are from other countries
GCC's and the ones that you take when
you're 15 16 you take those before you
finish secondary school and I did I
can't remember light-up double science
history math English Spanish I was
really bad sociology and that's
I can't remember them so I got two A's
six B's and to seize my Caesar in math
and Spanish which is very surprising
because I never went into the world of
finance even though my mathematics at
that age wasn't that good so you know
Greg don't mean everything so if you're
a bit like me I hope you persistent and
be like you're not responding get that I
don't know but you don't to be crazy but
either you approach them is a I think
you see my message I message you were
you able to get back to me or if you
kind of like Fox it off whatever then
hard-to-get is always a good way and not
necessarily hard to get basically just
go about your business do whatever you
want to do elsewhere you know get catch
the attention of other guys who may be
interested and have fun and all of a
sudden you might be a bit more
interested in you but yeah we have all
been there okay don't worry about that
I say if you guys only just broke up you
should give yourself some time to mourn
cry those tears scream those screams get
it out of yourself okay and then you
need to wipe those tears and then you
need to look at yourself and work out
exactly how amazing you are there's lots
of opportunity for you in the future I
would definitely say preoccupy yourself
with other things that might be other
guys that might be other girls that
might be doing some stuff that you've
never done before and literally just
spending your time not thinking about
him
and get on and the more you keep doing
other stuff and surrounding yourself
with other people you'll realize that
there are things that you're probably
missing out on when you're in a
relationship and then something else may
come along or he may decide that he
wants you back so who knows
when so number one I would definitely
take a guy back off the cheating because
people make mistakes if someone cheats
what this is my personal opinion is so
much heats one time I will let that one
slide because I'm a forgiving person if
someone cheats twice or three times at
that point in time they have a problem
and they can't be trusted now in the
circumstance you're talking about this
person cheated on you with your friend
oh hell no oh hey did you get it you
could forget stuff in taking your sorry
ass back and your friend yeah that one
is well you're serious you can't be
having a bunch of vipers in your in your
circle so no way well my dear you are in
my club exactly I always found it very
hard fitting in in certain environments
because I'm not a massive drinker and
I'm not myself but yeah I love clubbing
I did love courage enough to show a
couple of dance moves dance hello so if
you are really not into it
you can either if I say fake it till you
make it and sometimes the best way to
get on with people is actually to ask
them about themselves and I'm sorry that
I say ask really wrong ask ask them
about themselves and the best
conversation is in the world
and the best people who have best
relationships are the people who listen
to other people what you should do is
ask them a lot of questions about
themselves and stop and listen and take
their responses and people love people
who listen to them
I was definitely a mummy's girl but I
think what the way I grew up you know
I'm Nigerian so in your household you do
everything right children are like this
tiny is like Butchie gonna gets me gonna
gets me
trust me you're always cold you're
always cooking you're always cleaning so
getting out of the home was like go
ahead freedom freedom like I couldn't
wipe the get out of home but funnily
enough like I thought that all that
stuff kind of prepared me for you know
moving out and being mature I think as
long as you have a schedule so the key
things that you need like from food to
cleaning to your bills just organize
everything as much as you possibly can
I think how can you bring any guy home
to your traditional parents is how I
like to see things now I'm gonna bring
any guy home ever until I was like 19 20
and the key thing is my parents are very
traditional as well and they don't want
me with riffraff or anyone who behaves
nonsense and doesn't have respect so I
think it's all about the kind of guy
you're seeing where he white black
Martian or Chinese it's here a decent
respectable guy I think if your parents
can see a guy who's decent and
respectable
they'll be happy for you to be with him
I remember when Mike first met my mom
you know he knew the levels you don't
refer to my mom by the first name you
called her aunty aunty you had simple
eyes and actually when he he was already
at my house and my mum came to my house
and visit me today who is a
strange-looking chap
she gave him that kind of but I thought
Mathis it's Michael
Michael's been helping us with business
in this niche and when she realized that
he was giving himself for me and for
even some things that she doesn't north
he was really helping she really saw
that he was a responsible individual he
should be happy
to leave her child live again right
Black Martian Chinese don't go and try
and show your parents a guy who's going
to be a douche because that's not going
to work with any parent no matter what
culture they're from this is a really
serious topic that I don't think I can
interest in one simple video in this way
and it's a problem that one I think a
lot of people go through so my number
one tip would be sounds really strange
that would be to change your diet make a
choice to love yourself and loving
yourself is feeding yourself with good
food try and fill yourself with some
fresh food cook for yourself get some
salads in there get some fruit get some
green juices get things that will raise
your spirit
honestly the time do I feel worse or
when I'm eating crap don't deal with
that on your own you need to speak to
someone or communicate even if it's a
people on YouTube even if it's with your
friends or a neighbor or community don't
face this on your own because there's so
many who go from it
I don't currently have any tattoos and I
am NOT adversity getting one I think
that because it's so permanent that
anything I get would have some really
really strong meaning and the only thing
that I feel really strongly about is
love and I think it's I think it's kind
of cliche to get like love for yourself
so maybe I need to find a symbol for
love yes I think everyone was bullied at
school if I'd be totally honest with you
yes people were very you know people who
were critical of me
oh you're ugly you're skinny your hair's
messy your this or that that kind of
thing but I was quite delusional I've
always been delusional thank God from
her delusions so and I
and really happy the way I grew up cuz
my mom always told me that I was amazing
and would always lift me up and
encouraged me and she's the singer sound
good some people Jill knows me but she
said don't worry they're just jealous so
and even if they weren't jealous at all
but I always had that kind of confident
that I don't really care what you say
but I didn't really care what anybody
had to say about me and for in in that
sense I was quite unique and quite
independent I can say that things did
bother me obviously and I would get
upset and I would look at myself and
yeah could I not be any better but you
know I never really dwelled on those
thoughts for much longer and because
what's the point I can't change it so
I'm gonna enjoy it so guys I hope you
enjoyed that ta Wow but then I will
definitely do another one I really
enjoyed it and actually on my blog I'm
gonna go into a lot of these topics in
more detail so I have videos or I will
be having videos on my blog which are
you know nothing you do they're special
you're on video so make sure you're
following me on my blog over there where
I talk about more life stuff so guys
thank you for watching and I'll see you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
