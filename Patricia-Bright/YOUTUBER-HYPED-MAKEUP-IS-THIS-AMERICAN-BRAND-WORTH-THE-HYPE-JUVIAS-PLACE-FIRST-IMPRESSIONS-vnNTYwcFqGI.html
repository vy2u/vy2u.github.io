dramatic you guys will ever see me oh my
gosh Wow Wow
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well today
I'm coming to you bare face I'm feeling
like I look a little bit red like I'm a
little bit on the like terracotta plump
pop side but it's okay I use the
different foundation and we're gonna
work through this but today I'm about to
try out brands that youtubers have
recommended to me and I'm obviously in
America right about now we couldn't call
it America I don't know what we're just
calling it that all right and I've been
wanting to get my hand on a brand called
Julius place for the longest and I've
seen lots of big youtubers talk about
this brand nikkietutorials did like a
video calling it the most pigmented
plate in the world I seen James Charles
using on his Instagram page I've seen
loads of people amazing people using
this brand now I think it's just about
available in the UK on the beautybay but
I'm here I'm here right about now so I
picked up a few goodies and asked the PR
team for some extras as well because I
wanted to try everything and I'm about
to be dramatic with a little bit of
Julius place so this palette is new this
is the Saharan 2 by Julius let's go and
let's go and I'm excited oh my god whoa
okay whoa there we've got your classic
neutrals but then look at the blues
you guys don't know but I'm scared I'm
scared of balloon I'm scared of blue
this is a whole lot of dramatic and you
guys know I'm not used to a dramatic but
I'm gonna see what I can do and then
this is the nubian 200 a quite similar
but this is a deeper deeper blue and
there is another like burnt red in here
but this is a little dark shade here
called Jezebel this I'm gonna mix it
let's work with these together I don't
do too dramatic but we're gonna do that
I'm gonna go in with this Aharon 2 by
julius and i'm gonna go in with this
shade here tazza
in at my crease what I've seen the
pigment is very very real so I feel like
I need to just
you like chill this is like my classic
shade that I always wear I feel like I
can build it up it's not as like
extremely scary as I thought it would be
there's pigment there's good pigment
look at my brush right but without it
being like insane
I'm very minimal fallout okay I feel
like I gotta do a swatch before I keep
going I feel like I just need to swatch
everything so you guys can see oh my
goodness look at that that is a blue oh
my gosh I'm actually excited now I'm
actually excited oh my gosh do you know
what it's mad
I feel like swatching has to be done
before I start look at that my swatches
are pitiful but still you can see
they're fabulous shades based on this
what I thought they were going to look
like isn't what they're gonna look like
we're gonna wing a look let's go some
face
yeah first is like warm that up nicely
oh my gosh there's a lot of Pikmin I'm
having to actually be more careful
because it's easy to go slightly
overkill now I'm gonna go with a little
makeup revolution on my lid this
concealer I love it just to kind of mute
out my lid and then ideally like looking
up trick help me with my little cup
crease you know this is the most
dramatic you guys will ever see me drama
okay so yes I'm gonna go with bball on
my lid oh that's more like a like cobalt
II blue wow wow it's more like a
turquoise II blue I'm gonna add some a
Cleopatra from the Julius 2 palette and
just mix that that might be a blue I'm
more like I'm more for that turquoise
one it's nice but it's a lot but now
I've got like two tone blues oh my gosh
she went from I don't do dramatic
makeups having like eight colors on her
eyes yes I did
it's beautiful this is actually scary I
never do makeup like these guys I love
it though I love it
I feel like I need to like mute the
orange of it because it's just giving me
a bit too like orange that looks
beautiful
I swear that I said this is the most
color I've worn like in about a million
years
that Bieber looks beautiful just there
you've got nice the blends we need to
fill in some more bits we here with the
jump to the drama I'm gonna go in with
this Ozora and just do that under my eye
I've actually almost used all the colors
in this palette it's a lot it's really a
lot okay that shade is a lot for under
there the eyebrow because it is
two-toned
okay we're gonna add some concealer some
lashes so line up and see how everything
comes together
so I had to change cuz that yellow top
was giving me
classy Carmelita I was actually clashing
so hard but I feel like I put a little
look together and I'm feeling it
intensely this is very different for me
like I don't another color girl however
I am living for this I would I add a few
last final touches I feel like this is
these are two-tone situation would look
really nice in my tear duct do people
still do tear duct I feel like it's a
little bit like 90s ice oh okay well we
need to just settle down on the tear
duct okay it's looking a little bit like
sleep in the eye it's gonna use this
little angle brush just to get that like
real real sharp bit of power the honey's
cuz I'm shiny AF these are lights Wow
you know let me tell you in all honesty
on this channel I back in the day I used
to just avoid doing makeup stuff just
cuz I find I'm not very good at it I
don't really know much about it but you
know I persist it and I feel like a
Timberland I can blend okay and that's
that's good enough for me darling but
those of you who doubted my blending
ability we tried we tried today okay I'm
gonna go with the Sahara and blush
volume two now actually I think I might
have bought this on beautybay but in my
return this so I'm actually quite
excited whoa okay different this is a
different brush palette for me I've
gotta be on interview I think I'm gonna
use B this looks kind of muted but also
kind of movi or towel I feel like for
this look I need be it's weird how many
blush colors can you actually wear is
this gonna look Oh
should you like it might work I'm giving
myself doll like us weird it looks nice
though I'm just not used to wearing like
a muted move but actually it works it
actually works unexpected because I
would never never never ever picked that
for myself but I rock this and it looks
alright on me because I usually go for
like the dark reds and the Burgundy's
but I like I'm gonna go over my Becca
highlight because I don't know if they
have a highlight palette I might do but
I don't have it so I've been using this
highlight I feel like you guys have been
seeing me wearing this a lot and yeah it
pops
it's a while oh my gosh this Lucas Wow
excuse the lips they're so Ashley but
we're gonna we're gonna solve that right
now fYI I've I've done a video like
wearing doing my makeup in Sephora or
it's coming out listen you have to be
cautious I effed up my lips
don't know how because I use the alcohol
and everything my lips are like lizard
lips
the day after I woke up and my lips are
sweating aren't your lips wet someone
tell me about lip sweating how does it
happen and then it was like all like
bumpy and raschi but I've had an
allergic reaction to like that on my
lips before and it's usually to
something that's in certain lip products
and I have to get a steroid cream and
it's just started settling down like
literally just okay so this is new this
is the Empress minute collection my
devious place mats and a metallic liquid
lipstick oh it's a duo how do they rock
this metallic member put in just a
little bit but this shade this shade
works for me I'm down and I think it
might work for this look and I can't
line my lips are not in the best shape
right now
really not
it's kind of orangey but it doesn't cut
with the eye is it may well have that
brought everything together yes this is
German AF I feel extra 8f right now
people whip up the Herbert okay guys
that is my finished look this isn't me
but I actually love it the pigment is so
real in the palette it's like it's crazy
it is crazy and back in the day I never
wore blues because they just look kind
of like a she'll they went like dark
grey on me but look at the level of that
shine now Shannon Shannon it looks so so
good very different for me I love it but
I can see what youtubers and creators
and instagramers are hyping about the
brand because it's killed it even this
blush that I was like ah look at it I
think it looks fabulous the lip shade is
actually relatively just nice and
neutral it's not something that I want
to write home about or anything like
that
but it's nice and I didn't try do not
now you put the metallic on top it's
nice I can just do it like as a little
highlight in the middle very much in my
mind it's a kind of currently textured
but yeah that's still really really nice
what do you guys think is this kind of
different for me would you
I think I thought I feel like a you - I
feel like nikkietutorials I feel like I
need to go to do this did you live
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo I feel like
I need that I feel like I need to come
up close to the camera like without
looking like a broken a bone or I'm
constipated okay guys that is it for me
I've turned out one of these are really
height brands and I had a hundred
percent loved it I feel sad and tabulous
darlings other than any other height
brands when it comes to beauty or makeup
but you want me to try out also make
sure you're following me on my Instagram
and my Twitter cuz that is where I
usually DM and announce giveaway winners
so guys thank you for watching I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
