one of the first of my series and I'm
just gonna call this one by the way I
don't rehearse or practice anything that
I say so if I talk to your British
whatever but I'm gonna call this never
be afraid to use your talents and you
know sometimes we feel that you know all
that person is way more talented than me
or that person does that so good blah
blah blah you know and we get caught up
in sometimes what other people are doing
but sometimes you can't even see the
amazing talents that we have been given
and that we only have and I really feel
it's important not to waste your talents
not to hide your talents sometimes you
know we're looking for the big things
they're looking for something great or
flamboyant that the whole world will see
as a talent but often you know our
talents are little things for me I feel
like my talent may be cheering people up
I like to cheer people up I like to make
them feel good about themselves
now I'm not Oprah Winfrey you know
sitting on some TV show doing that it
might little way I can do that and I can
use my talent I use my gear and some of
you guys may be like you know singers or
or dancers or have you know gifts of
just amazing ability to retain
information and you never see these
things is as gifts but really they are
gifts and they are talents and I do feel
that a life is wasted until you've used
those talents like you're meant to use
them and sometimes you don't you know
it's hard to identify what's your gift
and you got to sit down and look at
yourself a victim myself I'm done I'm
amazing because of this this and this
and this these are gifts that only I
have there is a gift that make me
special and make me stand out and then
work out how are you going to use that
gift to you know to make an impact to
make an impact on others to make an
impact on yourself
whatever they are trust me there are so
many talents that
a lot of people have and you may feel
like oh no I don't want anyone to know
that I I can do that you know even if
it's wiggling your ears do you know how
much entertainment you can be bring
wiggling your ears in my table it you
know embarrassed about it
there's a guy at work well hi Aaron I'm
gonna talk about you right now
who does something extremely strange he
Wiggles his eyes but you know it's
talent all the same and will be like oh
Aaron wiggle your eyes
and he will do it and we get
entertainment from that so guys I really
think it's really important to just to
use your talents and don't be scared and
don't feel embarrassed and never feel
that your talent is not as good as
somebody else's so it's not amazing or
it's not you know big or obvious because
it is is to you and it is on the few
people all the millions of people that
you're going to impact with your talents
don't let anybody ever say to you you
know your talent is not talent because
it is okay as long as you see it as it
is it definitely is so I hoped you liked
my words of encouragement and I will
talk about something else later thanks
