today I am filming a get ready with me
tonight I am off to a Maybelline party
to celebrate the launch of the new
Maybelline and Gigi Hadid collection
make sure you are following me on my
socials cuz I'm sure I would have posted
some good pictures and snaps and stuff
because I feel like Gigi Hadid was meant
to be there so if she was maybe old and
said something
yes I've literally just got myself ready
and I'm literally about to go out the
door I'm gonna take this off to then put
it back on but yeah I'm is actually
about to head out the door to the event
so if you want to see the process of me
getting ready which includes my tanning
routine this hair stop with a receding
hairline hack trick whatever this makeup
look and what I've used and obviously my
full outfit then give this video a
massive thumbs up before you continue
watching before tonight always prep my
skin using it the loving tan exfoliating
mitt and the ascent Moretz kind of
shower x-foliator and then it's a
moisturizer I love this from fake big
it's like a dry oil and I just spray it
in all the dry areas and for tan
especially before going out I love the
etcetra it's fast responsible tanning
mitt and I my tanning mitt tanning mist
and then I spray it onto the mitt and
then my leg and then rub it in I love
this because like I said it's fast
response so perfect before an event and
it gives an amazing color and this is my
favorite the back applicator from Sultan
oh my god I've linked it down below
literally a tanning dream so this is
before and this is after and now we can
move on to makeup so I'm just gonna get
to me hair out me face and then I love
this moisturizer from L'Oreal it's their
Extra Ordinary oil and lightweight
moisturizer and I'm going to be using
the Mac prep and prime at natural
radiance yellow as my primer today
because we are going in with kind of
like a thick full coverage foundation so
I love my skin to feel super nourished
underneath speaking of which I'm using
the Maybelline at superstate 24-hour
coverage foundation yes it looks
ridiculously dark as I think well as you
can see but remember my tan is
developing and I promise you it does
match it's just kind of like a big
transformation you know but moving on
I'm gonna be using it B at heart shape
tape concealer in the shade a medium and
just applying that underneath my eyes
honest to god guys this is the best full
coverage concealer ever and I'm just
blending that away with my Beauty
Blender and this does
to light my foundation as well then for
kind of like a cream at bronzer I'm
taking this foundation from a benefit
I've linked it down below I love this it
gives the most gorgeous color and it's
super super creamy and easy to blend so
I'm just applying that to kind of like
my cheeks my forehead and my neck area
as well then I'm gonna take the cap 1dt
shade and light palette and mix these
two it shades together to kind of it set
my under eye initially I am gonna go in
with a translucent powder but this just
gives me a little bit more brightness
and coverage so I'm just applying that
to kind of all the places I want to
sharpen up and speaking of sharpening up
I'm just gonna enhance that kind of
crema contour we did with via powder
shade from the same kat von d palette
this is correct the middle shade and
yeah super nice a cool tone color but as
I said I'm just gonna bake underneath my
eyes and then to sharpen up my contour
underneath there as well and I am gonna
leave the powder there just because I'm
scared for any fallout of the eyeshadow
so just went ahead and did my brows
using it the Urban Decay a micro brow
pencil and the benefit gimme brow in the
shade 3 and now we can move on to eyes
on my god I've been dying to use this
eyeshadow palette it is the dare to
create I shadow palette from morphe and
I'm just gonna take this a big initial
transition color here and I blend that
in up to my crease with a big fluffy
brush we're gonna be doing a norm that
by today and then I'm just gonna further
deepen up the crease using a darker and
darker eyeshadows sticking with the
warmer Brown theme as you guys know but
this is gonna tie in with kind of like
the lips up we're going with later on so
yeah just buffing at these colors back
and forth and then taking this a big eye
shadow on a flat brush and just packing
it on this is when I was scared for
Fallout so that's why I kept the powder
so we could just wipe it away if needs
be but there wasn't actually a huge
amount of Fallout so I'm pretty it
trapped with that and then to further
deepen up the crease I'm just gonna take
this dark brown again sticking with the
map theme and just to enhance the crease
deepen the crease and create that
transition that we all love so yeah
going back in with my previous brushes
not picking up any excess product or
anything but just making sure it all
blends away it seamlessly but then I'm
just gonna take this warm brown shade
again and run it underneath my eye to
tie everything together and then it
taking like a flat brush again on that
same dark brown color I'm gonna press
this into my upper lash line and lower
lash line just to kind of create
the illusion of I don't know I just feel
like it ties the look together and adds
a bit more depth to the look and then
going in with a fluffy brush just to
make sure it's all abundant together
then I'm just taking the highlighter
that I plan to use on a pencil brush to
highlight my inner corner and then it
using this amazing eyeliner from L'Oreal
it's called like super Cooper and these
lashes you guys have been asking so much
about these there are links down below
but now I am gonna brush away the powder
on my face and further bronze the skin
using the mineralized skinfinish from
Mac in a dark golden I love this one for
more like a subtle bronze because I
didn't really need to add any more
bronzer as the cream bronzer had warmed
up my skin quite a lot but this would
not be a look if I didn't use my Mac
mineralized skinfinish in global glow
this literally gives the most gorgeous
glow to the ginn what glow to the gun
I'm thinking about Jen anyways oh just
glow it to the skin and I'm obsessed
with it but moving on I'm gonna use this
blusher from the master chrome a palette
from Maybelline just to give a subtle
flush to the skin and these are Beauty
pie strobing drops have been my go-to
you guys know I say this every time love
a liquid highlighter because it gives it
such a gorgeous base in my heart I just
cling to and it literally makes anything
I put on the top pop on it and that's
why I feel like a lot of people have
been asking me how I get that glow and I
literally dab it all over my skin so I
think that's why but using it the
Maybelline master chrome highlight in
Multan glow montgo more gold something
like that to give it the final highlight
and Phillips I'm taking it this L'Oreal
infallible lip liner in the color
tangerine ver to go to line at my lips
because we were feeling in the orange
vibes as you'll see it from when I wear
my outfit there is a reason behind the
bright lip today and at the bright lip
today is huda beauty at mamacita I've
linked it down below cuz I did actually
think it was limited edition so I wasn't
gonna use it and then I found it online
so I've linked it down below for you
guys it's the most perfect orange ever
but this is the finished makeup look
I'm obsessed that lash line is killing
me I should have gone over it with
eyeliner but anyways what can you do
let's move on to hair so I've been doing
this hairstyle a lot recently and it's
just like an up do it slicked-back
ponytail so I'm just going over my kind
of little baby hairs with my
straightness because I know they'll come
it to haunt me if I don't and we want it
to go at slicked back so I do
gotta straighten their baby hairs a
little bit I've been at loving this like
hair oil it's from easy locks but it's
also a heat protectant so I've been at
loving using that cuz it really
nourishes the hair kind of flattens the
hair and it smells amazing so once I've
done that I mean it she's just gonna go
ahead and type my hair up into a
ponytail just kind of brushing back all
the wispy bits and getting all a little
like dangly it's straggly bit and then
tying it up and then any of the baby
hairs I'm just gonna take like a little
hair grip and tie them back so nothing's
gonna be it popping out later but we
will obviously go over it with hairspray
and stuff so it's all locked in place
but does anyone get those little baby
hairs at the back because they're so so
annoying it so I just have to make sure
that they're all clipped away and
they're not gonna undo any later
now I'm taking my hair wonder this one
is from cloud 9 I believe and you could
have curled your hair before and then
tied it up in a ponytail but I didn't
want it them to be like too too tight
curls and like too many curls so I
always just kind of tie my hair up first
and then just go over a few of bits with
the curler because I do kind of brush it
out and run my fingers through it so
they become a bit more loose and beachy
but that is the finished ponytail but
this kind of receding hairline I've got
going on is not OK and I've got this in
the mail like ages ago and I've only
really just used it it's like a hair I
shadow especially for this to get rid of
any kind of patches that you've got
literally look at the difference it's
been a game changer for me and I have my
crew bonded extensions too and if I dab
the eyeshadow over them they become a
lot more subtle when I've got my hair up
and in hairstyles like this so I've been
really loving that and I've linked it
below but now to finalize the hair I'm
just gonna spray it with hairspray make
sure all the kind of like curls are in
place and all the wispy bits but now
outfit so as you can see I've tried to
incorporate some color I've matched my
lipstick to this kind of I don't know
it's like a blazer and shorts suit and
I've left everything links down below so
that was the finish it get ready with me
I really hope you guys enjoyed it and
got a little bit of a different vibe for
me I feel like you might not know that I
like dress like this or my makeup like
this sometimes because most the time it
is always a nude lip I thought I have to
incorporate some sort of light orange
Ness to go with the outfit and then yet
you got inside my tanning routine and
all that good stuff and
see this hairstyle which I've been
loving at the moment so give it a
massive thumbs up if you've enjoyed
everything make sure to hit that
subscribe button before you leave I'm
sure I would have posted other pictures
from the event so make sure you follow
me on my social for them until next
video I will see you soon bye guys
