today I'm gonna do a sunny more fun
video to kind of round off the year
today I'm gonna be showing you my top
ten beauty trends of 2017 that need to
die basically it's a roundup of the
trends that kind of happened or blew up
over the past year that I really really
hope don't follow us into 2018 because
one they were either weird - I just
didn't like them at all and three yeah
they just need to stop this video is
meant to be kind of light-hearted and
fun everyone's gonna have different
opinions but I would love it if you guys
leave amiri your beauty trends that you
hated over the year in the comments
section down below I would love to know
and see if there was any that I missed
oh let me know if you actually loved
some of the trends I'm gonna be talking
about let's just as sound off in the
comments section down below make sure to
give this video a thumbs up subscribe
but before you continue and make sure
the notification belt is on without
further ado let's have some fun and I'm
gonna start with number 10 so this I
feel might be the most kind of
controversial or I feel maybe some
people did like this trend and it's
holographic makeup I just never got on
board with it whether it was on the lips
highlight whatever I just I don't know
I'm just maybe it's cuz I'm not that
much of a creative person or whatever I
just feel like it's not very wearable I
suppose makeup is a form of art and
people used it more of the artistic
purpose but I just kind of hope people
are over it by now and ya never know I
just thought it just looked kind of
weird especially when it was more like
greeny kind of colors it just kind of
looks alien II number 9 is body glitter
now fair enough for the festival season
having some glitter on your face maybe
even in the roots of your hair but over
the past year people were wearing
glitter on them but on their boobs and I
was just thinking how uncomfortable or
how impractical imagine taking that off
later let's say you are at first one
you've got glitter all over your ass and
then you're absolutely smashed and you
come home and trying to take the glitter
off and it's like oh you've got glitter
and you craft Plus you can't even sit
down and just glitter on your tip so I'm
just imagining trying to really like
scrub it off and it just being a little
bit painful you know so I'm just kind of
maybe if we just give the body glitter a
bit of a rest and let your titties be in
peace you know number eight is actually
a trench that I did try and then after I
try that I did kind of think like what
the and that's lollipop lips now
they do look kind of cool but fast and
then you kind of really look at it and
it it kind of does just look like you've
been like kissing someone or doing
something for a while and then you've
just kind of stopped and looked to
yourself in the mirror and it's gone
everywhere well I said it did kind of
look cool and reminded me kind of like
zombie ish and I think I kind of did it
around Halloween time but again it's
just not wearable I'm kind of over it
yeah I just kind of hope that stays in
2017 and we just stick to the normal
lipid now number seven is a tag and that
was the a hundred layers tag
I actually think people hurt themselves
doing it there was like the a hundred
layers of foundation lashes wigs nail
varnish highlighter lipstick I just like
what a waste of product you know I mean
100 layers of lipstick I feel like your
lips
afterwards must had wanted to remove
themselves from your body and the a
hundred layers of nail varnish again
like what a waste and imagine trying to
like take that off I just think it was
it was fun but like let's just keep that
in 2017 I mean it was pretty ridiculous
and number six is 3d nails sorry but I
just think that absolutely ideas fair
enough along now whatever fair enough a
bit of glitter but people were taking it
far this year sticking on actual 3d
objects or having things like dangling
from them sorry but whenever I see nouns
like that I just think like how do you
wipe your arse or like how do you like
to just like scratch your nose you know
I mean maybe I'm just gross and I just
like to use my fingers to do whatever I
want and be comfortable doing it but
really I just think like oh they just
like a bit impractical and I feel like
after a day I'd be like get this
off my fingers powerfully sure okay
another trend is for browse crown
again I get make up is a form of ah who
the hell came up with this one Brow's is
such an important part of your face so I
feel like it was quite a fun way to kind
of go a viral was with all these at
Broward trends because I got another one
coming up but really like crown brows I
don't know I mean I get that they're
pretty but keep the germs on your face
just for festivals and keep your brows
down because if you really walking
around with like the crown brows I don't
know who you think you are
and another brow friend at number four
was the twisted brow now this was kind
of cool at first until you kind of
really looked at the pictures and it's
pretty impossible to really attract your
eyebrow unless you have like the longest
of longest eyebrow hairs and if your
eyes are long enough to plat then I
really recommend you go and get them
maybe like something but it was all
Photoshop anyway pretty much so it was
kind of defeated the object I guess this
goes to show that that was more like an
art form in the makeup world but really
like parted brows what's gonna be next
like plaited pubes number three was one
that I feel completely blew up because
there was so many kind of options for
this and it's applying a foundation with
weird objects I swear I swore some of
the weirdest weirdest like objects being
used to apply foundation
there were people using talons and
condoms I likes really that important to
just be like smacking these lines across
your face didn't even work
I felt like actually the condom led to
those kind of like silicone sponges that
were meant to be very good so maybe that
was actually kind of a benefit I don't
know that was just some weird weird
stuff being smacked across people's
faces to use to apply as foundation and
I just wasn't here for it at number two
it's another weird objects one I hope
people stop using weird objects to
contour like do you really have to put
yourself in danger to get your contour
looking a shot I feel like no wasn't
that a girl that kind of cut up a
Louboutin shoe just to do that or people
are actually insane and as Kylie said
this year was the year of realizing
stuff and I realized some people are
insane and will do a lot further user
likes but I suppose if you really want
to slice your cheek open to get that
contour looking sharp
then be my guest and finally the number
one trend that I hope stays in 2017 is
nostril hair extensions now I don't even
know this was a thing and then I saw the
pictures which I'll insert here and oh
wow are you really gonna walk out the
house like that what is the purpose but
imagine if you like snorted hard while
you were doing it and then oops
you snore dilash but thought of nostril
hairs anyway is kind of gross to me and
should probably like sort out so the
fact that you'd want to extend them
emphasize them and make it a beauty
trend
baffles me like a baffles me and I just
hope that it doesn't suddenly move on to
my ear extensions or something else that
is completely bizarre next year so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video

10 trends I hope are left in 2017
