for this video I recreated a recent look
I put on my Instagram this is literally
my go-to around look it honestly only
takes me about 10 minutes there is no
eyeshadow involved or anything like that
it's literally making your skin focus
with everybody got 10 minutes starts the
one thing I want to focus on so if you
come with me and you know give this do
your thumbs up yeah this is definitely
being a skin focus video throughout a
supernatural kind of wisdom pair of
lashes and a simple nude lip and other
products as well but I think a well
suited to everyone so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video definitely make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you did
subscribe if you haven't already for
more videos Alecto and yes let's go
ahead and show you how to get this 10
minute go to gram obviously we are going
to be starting with a completely bare
face and the quickest way I find to
hydrate my skin is using mac's fix+ it's
like a water moisturizer almost though I
just spritz my skin with that and then
for primer I love The Hangover ex primer
from Too Faced it absorbs super quickly
and leaves my skin feeling instantly
hydrated and moisturized as well so
foundation I've been absolutely loving
the hourglass vanished it found Asian at
the moment I use the shade light beige
when I'm slightly paler which is now and
then I use golden tan and I'm slightly
more tan but I just feel like this gives
you the most flawless finish and I find
stick foundations quite quick to apply
also so I can see that I'm going to take
the Maybelline fit me concealer and
apply this underneath my eyes kind of
down the center of my face so on my chin
and on my forehead and then using a damp
Beauty Blender I just blend that out and
making sure I use the kind of tapered
side underneath my eyes and then those
kind of rounded side when I'm blending
the other bits just because I find that
way it gives me the best blend ability
is that even a word for powder I am been
loving it be a wire sell loose powder it
has a slight pinky undertone to it I
feel that that really brightens up
underneath my eyes and then it is
amazing to set the rest of the face as
well
a quick bronze isle of it via benefit
hoola bronzer I feel like it has the
perfect balance between cool and warm
undertone so it's almost like a contour
and a bronzer likes to warm up my skin
in one for absolutely a love it there
and then for blush recently I've been
absolutely
the of soap and glory peach Party Russia
as you can see it gives the most
gorgeous glow to your skin so if you're
not a massive fan of highlighter and
that's enough then you could a hundred
percent stop there but you know me and I
love a good glow so for that I'm going
to take the global glow a mineralized
skinfinish this just gives a gorgeous
bronzy glow to the skin and I'm all
about that look in the summer but then
for that added extra highlight I'm going
to take the Ofra Rodeo Drive highlighter
on a see if they go to this kind of
shade the pilot of the go to like that
pale gold so like laura geller gilded
honey and the Anastasia Beverly Hills so
Hollywood one they're all along the
similar lines I love this kind of color
then I'm just going to go ahead and
spray my face with fix+ again and that
is the skin that completed now on to
brows I'm going to take the a benefit
precisely my brow pencil in the shade 3
and then I like to set it in place with
the benefit gimme brow in the shade one
just because I like to have a little
more like tonal more tones to my
eyebrows so I use a darker pencil and a
lighter browser and beep on my favorite
one so mascara I'm going to take the
maybelline at bigshot colossal mascara
and actually just look at this mascara
on a thief or someone that never likes
to just run mascara I could easily it's
just wear this mascara on its own but
you guys need me and I love a pair of
lashes and my go-to lashes at the moment
have been via new ones from valor they
are in the it style whisper a real good
and you can use a code Rachael Larry for
15% off and then finally to complete the
look I'm just going to go for an easy
and nude lip I always like to line my
lips no matter kind of what the occasion
just because of my lip shape it is
softly uneven so I always just like to
make sure that I balance it out using a
lip liner and this shade is like a go-to
nude for me and then I've been loving
this product at the moment this is
Leonardo velvet glide kind of lip slide
now if that makes sense in the shade
stripped so it's not a matte liquid
lipstick it's not a lip gloss is almost
like a hybrid between the two is super
super comfortable on the lip and I feel
like the color isn't too a nude and it
has a really nice kind of pinky
undertone to it and if you guys haven't
checked this out and you're in the
market for like a new nude I highly
recommend this formula but this is it's
in that finished look so I thought it
was pretty simple enough so I really
hope you guys enjoyed so that was the
finished look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it I know it's not super minimal
planned but then I do feel like this is
too extra either so for me this is super
easy to achieve in ten minutes and I
feel confident enough to walk out for
our kind of look presentable but it
didn't take you that long at all the
Japanese majors give this video a thumbs
up if you enjoyed the whole mineral glam
look and it subscribe if you haven't
already because I would love to see you
in my next video but until then I'll see
you soon
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
