hey guys welcome back to my channel so
i'm in a booty well not really different
setting but i'm a different setting than
I usually were just because I kind of
wanted to break up be a bit less re no
not like less professional but this
video as you can see is the 15 weird
questions tagged so I didn't really feel
like sitting in front of my leg history
background I kinda wanted to be a bit
more relaxed bit more chatty and a bit
more so real so I thought I would just
feel this is in my sister's bedroom so
if you're watching Ellen sorry I you've
got the best natural lighting let me
know if you kind of prefer this natural
lighting just because I might begin to
film in mine in more natural lighting
just because I might rearrange my
filming room and stuff like that so let
me know if you prefer this lighting to
the studio lighting the studio lighting
does give sort of a bit more of a
professional feel like I said but yeah
I'm rambling let's go on with the
questions and let me know in the
comments below so i just googled like
random youtube taxes because i wanted to
do something different other than a
makeup tutorial fellow I've been doing
loads of makeup tutorials recently and i
came across the 15 weird questions
tagged so i'm just going to go through
them and ask them so you guys can kind
of get to know me a bit better i know
you guys like these kind of videos so
yeah let's answer the questions number
one what's a nickname only your family
calls you and I think it might just be
like family and close friends but I get
called Cheech chi Chi and Peach I really
don't know how it came from rachel i
think it was Rachel then rage then it
was like Richie Chi and then it was just
chi Chi then Cheech and then page number
two what's a weird habit of yours it's
not necessarily weird and its really
annoying by always always always pick my
eyelashes I pick my eyelashes well so I
do it so we'd have it by do accents all
the time oh I go like a lot sometimes
for its peak like smack my lips together
that's so annoying especially when I
pointing it out to other people or like
I realize that I'm doing it then ever
it's like the ice breaks and everyone
realizes how much I do it and it is
severely annoying and weird do you have
any weird phobias
um I said previously I'm scared of death
updating that's really weird when I
think that's quite a like a popular
phobia but I feel like quite a lot of
people have that I'm really kind I'm
scared of food that smells it not like
terrifies me but like if it's got really
like eight beans tuna all that sort of
stuff like oh actually I'd be scared one
day Jack she eat them because the smell
of that makes me feel seriously ill is
that a thing I don't Reno I feel like I
just made up around a month for that one
what song do you secretly love to blast
and fell out when you're alone I really
like listening him listening to Ariana
Grande and Demi Lovato's like live
performances that they've done just
because they're so good at seeing like I
know Demi Lovato did a few I think it
was like a private session or something
and she's seeing like quite how old
songs like skyscraper and stuff like
that but it literally brings me to tears
and I've always liked my belong to and I
pretend it's me and everyone thinks
amazing it singing attend them on a
stage or something yeah I guess that
that counts one of your biggest pet
peeves and burping really gets to me
especially if it's like a wet loud but
like my friends do them all the time
that just may see fit it just really
gets to me boys that have really short
nails like really really short like dirt
under them I really really don't like
that or like anyone that's got nails
like that oh when people like doing a
blend their eye shadow like a fair
enough if you're doing like a cut crease
and I thought that's it this is kind of
like a classic arts for some like me but
when you're not doing companies and
y'all just trying to a smoker but you've
it's like lines between each color Oh
actually it's when people put sparkly
eye shadows in their crease wow that
really gets to me because it just
emphasizes my lines and doesn't look as
good as it can I know you had potential
there that smokey eye she's the matte
shades made the matte shades what's one
of your nervous habits um I ramble if
I'm really nervous I'll just touch it oh
I'll go like
or just like my face will go yeah i'll
say i'm going to change it now well and
when i get you just ramble if I'm really
nervous or I feel unprepared or
something I just start talking a lot
maybe quite quickly really random stuff
just because I i feel like i've got a
further silence or i've i've just got so
much my mind like it's all just coming
out as I word vomit so I think that's
probably my worst nervous have it what
side of the bed do you sleep on more
recent I ok every don't know I know some
rights right so my bed is that way and I
sleep on that side and that is the right
so I sleep mainly on the right by sea
but like an angle because I problem I
cushions up in the corner and like sleep
on them like that so I think more on the
right but it did for ages ages ages i
was on the left always what was your
first stuff animal and its name i had so
many beanie babies as a child like we
had a beanie baby shocked on the end of
our road and we had so so many so i
think it might have been one of them but
the stuffed animal that I've got and
like I've still got and it's always been
at the thing that I sleep with is a
dolphin called flip that my auntie cathy
got me when I was like really small
what's the drink you always order at
starbucks i really go to starbucks just
because there's more Koster's near me if
I have if I'm getting a warm drink it's
normally a skinny vanilla latte ah as it
gets warmer stuff I always see Americans
on snapchat with like this Roz bring a
pomegranate tea with added syrup and i
really i really want to try that it
looks so good those kind of like fruity
ice tea time I steers one of my favorite
drinks ever like peach ice tea is
definitely up there with my favorite
drink so something like that I want to
start to get now it's starting to get a
bit warmer what's a beauty Rowley preach
but never actually practice a decent
skincare routine I had such a good one
for ages and then I just got so lazy and
I always use
wipes take my makeup off and I feel when
I watch everyone else is extensive
makeup removing routine where it's like
toning cleansing but I feel really
guilty that I don't have that sort of
nighttime routine I've got quite a few
products I could do it with I just never
do so I that's something I really want
to get into so really really decent
thora religious nighttime routine with
my skin I do use like I've got like
early moisturizers and stuff at that by
use regularly but not all the time so I
feel like that like i should like I feel
like a lot of beauty gurus not putting
myself in them but you know I mean they
preach like a really extensive sorry if
that angle and lighting is just change
my camera just died but yeah I feel like
a lot of people pre-check a really
extensive thorough skin care routine and
think that to have a really like
flawless skin you've got use like 800
products I feel like that's something I
should preach by really don't I could I
just well I just use works and it's
pretty really bad which way do you face
in the shower and I don't think there's
one way i'm mostly face i think away
from the shower front of it because i
have to like talk my head back and wash
my hair like that i think both I mix up
there's not one that I think it's more
distinctive than the other I don't know
why that's like a question does that
mean Lee thing if you face one way does
it mean you're a certain type of person
or something weird and random like that
I'm not sure do you have any weird body
skills and I think why used to be able
to identify can anymore used to be able
to turn my hand like all the way around
if I was on a table I can do that thing
with my tongue that like it goes like a
flower like I might insert a clip if
it's not too ugly yeah like that with
your tongue I can twist my tongue to the
side and I used to be able to do I have
quite like a flexible back so i can do
like the crap things and like
move my spine I really don't know if
that's so random honesty I don't know
most things I can do is just like with
my tongue I guess what's your favorite
comfort food that's bad but you love to
eat it anyways popcorn I think I've
really really like a popcorn salted
popcorn or like I guess by Chinese foods
always a good one like a comfort when
you're feeling low everyone's always
thought I'll just get chinese and watch
a movie like I feel like everyone loves
Chinese so probably those two what's a
phrase or exclamation you always say I
swear a lot and I really I think that's
bad oh wait does it mean like oh I'm
really not sure specific phrases if
there's anything you guys notice that I
say comment down below because I can't
think of any I feel like it's something
other people notice you say rather than
you notice that you say yourself I feel
like I say and I say like a lot but
that's not afraid or anything like on my
swear I swear a lot I think I say and
stuff like that a lot I've noticed when
I'm editing my videos I say that a lot
I'll it's you want to slam my head
against the wall because it's so
annoying and yeah so if there's anything
that you guys notice I say let me know
or if my friends are watching they can
tell me and i'll probably leave it in a
comment or something like that see
something like that stuff like that i
say that a lot okay this and the last
question time to sleep were you actually
wearing I mix up i tend to it i I really
cannot sleep naked I've really gone
because I just feel too exposed my I
still live at home with my parents and
they sometimes bring you like tea in the
morning so imagine I was just lying
hours like stock make it like yeah
cheers thanks for the tea I sleep in
like joggers or um normally like
dropping a t-shirt or just like pajama
bottoms and a t-shirt sometimes it's
really hot just like a baggy t-shirt and
pants I think that's like a pretty
comfortable thing none of those
