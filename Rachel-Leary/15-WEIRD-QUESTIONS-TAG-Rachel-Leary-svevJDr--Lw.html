I'm in a pretty well not really
different setting but I'm in a different
setting than I usually would just
because I kind of wanted to break up be
a bit less re no not like less
professional but this video as you can
see is the 15 weird questions tag so I
didn't really feel like sitting in front
of my like glittery background I kinda
wanted to be a bit more relaxed a bit
more chatty and a bit more so real so I
thought I would just feel this is in my
sister's bedroom so if you're watching
hurlan sorry you've got the best natural
lighting let me know if you kind of
prefer this natural lighting just
because I might begin to film in my in
more natural lighting just because I
might rearrange my filming room and
stuff like that so let me know if you'd
prefer this lighting to the studio
lighting the studio lighting does give
sup a bit more of a professional feel
like I said but yeah I'm rambling let's
go on with the questions and let me know
in the comments below so I just googled
like random YouTube tag just because I
wanted to do something different other
than a makeup tutorial fellow I've been
doing loads of makeup tutorials recently
and I came across the 15 weird questions
tag so I'm just gonna go through them
and answer them so you guys can kind of
get to know me a bit better I know you
guys like these kind of videos so yeah
let's answer the questions number one
what's a nickname only your family calls
you I think it might just be like family
and close friends but I get called
Cheech chichi and Peach I really don't
know how it came from Rachel I think it
was Rachel then rage then it was like
Richichi and then it was just chichi
then Cheech and then peach number two
what's a weird habit of yours it's not
necessarily weird and its really
annoying but I always always always pick
my eyelashes I pick my eyelashes well so
I do it so we'd have it by do accents
all the time oh I go like a lot
sometimes for us to speak like smack my
lips together and that's so annoying
especially when I point it out to other
people or like I realize that I'm doing
it then ever it was like the ice breaks
and everyone realizes how much
and it is sevillio annoying and weird do
you have any weird phobias um I said
previously I'm scared of death okay
that's really like weird when I think
that's quite a no I got popular phobia
but I feel like quite a lot of people
have that I'm really kind of I'm scared
of food that smells it not like
terrifies me but like it's got a really
like baked beans tuna all that sort of
stuff like I've actually I'd be scared
one day taxi eat them because the smell
of them makes me feel seriously oh is
that a thing I don't Reno I feel like I
just made up around months for that one
what song do you secretly love to
blossom bail out when you're alone I
really like listening listening to
ariana grande and Demi Lovato's like
live performances that they've done just
because they're so good at seeing like I
know Demi Lovato did a few I think it
was like a private session or something
and she's seen like quite how old songs
like skyscraper and stuff like that but
it literally brings me to tears and I've
always liked my malong turn I pretend
it's me and everyone thinks you're
amazing at singing pretend I'm on a
stage or something yeah I guess that
that counts one of your biggest pet
peeves um burping really gets to me
especially if it's like a wet loud but
like my friends do more at the time that
they see fit it just really gets to me
boys that have really short nails like
really really short like under them I
really really don't like that or like
anyone that's got nails like that oh
when people like doing a blend their
eyeshadow like a fair enough you're
doing like a cut crease and I thought
that said this is kind of a good classic
answer for someone like me but when
you're not doing companies and you're
just trying to just make out but you
it's like lines between each color Oh
actually it's when people put sparkly
eyeshadows in their crease wow that
really gets to me because it just
emphasizes my lines and doesn't look as
good as it can I know you had potential
there that smokey eye she's a nut shades
made the matte shades
what's one of your nervous habits I
ramble if I'm really nervous I'll just
touch it oh I'll go like
or just like my face will go yeah I'll
say I'm going to change it well and when
I get you just ramble if I'm really
nervous so I feel I'm prepared or
something I just start talking a lot
maybe quite quickly really random stuff
just because I feel like I've got a
further silence or I've just got so much
in my mind like it's all just coming out
as I work on it so I think that's
probably my worst now let's have it what
side of the bed do you sleep on more
recent I okay every don't know I know
some rights right so my bed is that way
and I sleep on that side and that is the
right so I sleep mainly on the right by
sea but like an angle because I propyl
my cushions up in the corner and like
sleep on them like that so I think more
on the right but it did for ages ages
ages I was on the left always what was
your first stuffed animal and its name I
had so many beanie babies as a child
like we had a beanie baby shocked on the
end of our road and we had so so many so
I think it might have been one of them
but the stuffed animal that I've got and
like I've still got and it's always been
the thing that I sleep with is a dolphin
called flip that my auntie Cathy got me
when I was like really small what's the
drink you always order at Starbucks I
rarely go to Starbucks just because
there's more Koster's near me if I have
if I'm getting a warm drink it's
normally a skinny vanilla latte ah as it
gets warmer and stuff I always see
Americans on snapchat with like this
rasping of pomegranate tea with added
syrup and I really I really want to try
that it looks so good those kind of like
fruity iced tea time iced tea is one of
my favorite drinks ever like peach iced
tea is definitely up there one of my
favorite drinks so something like that I
want to start to get now it's starting
to get a bit warmer what's a beauty rule
you preach but never actually practice a
decent skincare routine I had such a
good one for ages and then I just got so
lazy and I always use
wipes take my makeup off and I feel when
I watch everyone else is extensive
makeup removing routine where it's like
tightening cleansing but I feel really
guilty that I don't have that sort of
night time routine I've got quite a few
products I could do it with I just never
do so I that's something I really want
to get into so really really decent
thorough religious nighttime routine
with my skin I do use like I've got like
only moisturizers and stuff at that but
I use regularly but not all the time so
I feel like that like I should I think
feel like a lot of beauty gurus not
putting myself into them but you know I
mean they preach like a really extensive
sorry if that angle and light who's just
changed my camera just died but yeah I
feel like a lot of people pre-check a
really extensive thorough skincare
routine and think that to have a really
like flawless skin you've got use like
800 products I feel like that's
something I should preach by really
don't I could I just well I I just use
wipes and it's pretty really bad which
way do you face in the shower and I
don't think there's one way I'm mostly
face I think away from the shower front
of it cuz I have to like took my head
back and wash my hair like that I think
both I mix up there's not one that I
think it's more distinctive than the
other I don't know why that's like a
question does that mean Lee thing if you
face one way does it mean you're a
certain type of person or something
weird and random like that I'm not sure
do you have any weird body skills um I
think Y used to be able to I don't know
if I can anymore used to be able to turn
my hand like all the way around if I was
on a table I can do that thing with my
tongue like it goes like a flower like I
might insert a clip if it's not too ugly
yeah like that with your tongue I can
twist my tongue to the side I used to be
able to do I have quite like a flexible
back so I can do like the crap things
and like move my spine I really don't
know that's so rad I want to see I don't
know makes things I can do is just like
with my tongue I guess what's your
favorite comfort food that's bad but you
love to eat it anyways popcorn I think I
really really like popcorn
salted popcorn or like I guess like
Chinese food it's always a good one I
could comfort when you're feeling low
everyone's always thought I'll just get
Chinese and watch a movie like I feel
like everyone that's Chinese so probably
those two what's a phrase or exclamation
you always say I swear a lot and I
really I think that's bad
oh wait does it mean like uh I'm really
not sure specific phrases if there's
anything you guys notice that I say
comment down below because I can't think
of any I feel like it's something other
people notice you say rather than you
notice that you say yo Sal I feel like I
say I say like a lot but that's not a
phrase or anything like on my swear I
swear a lot I think I say and stuff like
that a lot I've noticed when I'm editing
my videos I say that a lot and it's you
wanna slam my head against the wall
because it's so annoying and yeah so if
there's anything that you guys notice I
say let me know or if my friends are
watching they can tell me and I'll
probably leave it in a comment or
something like that see something like
that stuff like that I say that a lot
okay next and the last question time to
sleep were you actually wearing I mix up
I tend to I really cannot keep naked
I really can't because I just feel too
exposed my I still live at home with my
parents and then sometimes bring me like
tea in the morning so imagine I was just
lying outside stock make it like yeah
cheers thanks for the tea I sleep in
like joggers or snow me like dropping a
t-shirt or just like pajama bottoms and

pretty comfortable thing none of those
