today we're doing something a little bit
different in the sense that I've created
this full look using all drugstore
products but even better than that it
cost me under 20 pounds I've definitely
been multi using products and really
trying to when I was ordering this stuff
prioritizing what I thought was most
important make sure you're not spending
unnecessary money and you can still
create like a glamour on a budget I feel
like I love the 20 pound makeup
challenge tag really minimal eyes makeup
and think you have to be really natural
and not like boring but calm be
adventuresome so I did try and be quite
glam and stick to kind of more me but
yeah using all products that came to a
total of under 20 pounds so this is
specially good towards the end of summer
we've all spent our money on like ice
creams and holidays yeah I really hope
you guys enjoy this video give it a
thumbs up if you did and if you like
look at this makeup look then please
give up James
okay so to start up with I feel like
everyone thinks if the fact that you're
spending 20 pounds or under it's going
to be a really not glam look so I
thought let's try something different
and try and make this as glam as
possible with the 20 pounds that we had
to spend so I don't know this counts is
cheating but I'm assuming people might
have tape at home so you don't have to
spend that 20 pounds on tape or gave her
something winged I mean this could
basically with all this makeup you could
do something a lot more natural and more
like appropriate for like back-to-school
that especially go on a budget or
something I'm just gonna try and make
this as glam as I can for 20 pounds so
you could wear this one night out and
really not have to break the bank so I'm
going to apply some tape to size of my
face
okay once we've done that I'm going to
use my concealer as a primer and then
set it in place with the same powder I'm
going to use on my face as well let me
just open this because yes we can see
like I'm using this from anyway and it
was one pound fifty so let's see how
this works I got mine in the color fair
because I knew I wanted to be
highlighting underneath my eyes but like
I said I'm going to use this for
piranhas as well
so just applied that concealer as a base
and now I'm going to set that in place
with powder this is the Nu a translucent
pressed powder and this was only one
pound everything I use I'll have listed
in the description bar down below and
like along with the prices and stuff I
got it all from Superdrug because that's
like our UK drugstore so if you're from
America I don't know if you might have
some of these brands or product but it
just gives you an idea so they are
sufficiently set in place I'm now just
going to go ahead and do one eye off
camera because I have actually no idea
how it's going to turn out so I'm gonna
do one eye and then I'll come back and
show you two how to do okay so I came up
with a little something and I'm like
it's not actually you know not too bad I
mean one of the colors that I
anticipated for my eyebrow as you can
see is a lot warmer and I wanted it to
be so what you're gonna do but okay to
start with I'm going to take the bronze
that I plan to use on my face which
again is from mua and was one pound and
we're going to use that as our initial
transition color actually a really nice
color through the crease when I got it I
was like oh my god that's gonna be so
dark when it goes in my skin so I'm yet
to see what that will look like but for
a crease color it almost could be like I
try an eye shadow it's really nice and
the tapes just going to help us make
sure that we get a nice straight line as
well then I shadows I'm using all one's
from this little Tanya burr palette this
one is the
here is it the Hollywood eyeshadow
palette and it is $5.99
so this and the foundation are the most
expensive things and the same parts I'm
then going to go in with this shade here
which is called bookworm and just use
that to further deepen up the socket
this is the color that I thought was
matte and it has a tiny bit of Sheen to
it but it is what is going to be in our
eyebrows so maybe if you have a few
pennies to spare you can invest in an
eyebrow pencil then I'm going to go in
the shade gold coin for our lid color
just press the bonds actually a really
pretty color
and we're also going to use this is our
cheekbone highlight as well it's a
really nice champagne color all about
that and multitask
what up I'm just going back into the
same brush that we put but grime on and
I haven't picked up any more I'm just
using it to diffuse those two together
then I'm going to take this gorgeous
color here which is called enchantment
it's like a really shimmery coppery
bronze color and on an angled brush
we're going to use that to create almost
like a winged liner but with shadow and
it's going to be spotty - so I thought
that's going to be pretty and that's
another reason why
let's take there as well because that
makes it so so so much easier for you
but just start kind of at the base of
the tape and drag it upwards and then
drive it and create that wing you do
have to apply like a bit of pressure
with this one to get the pigment that
you want just because it is so sparkly
but then once you do that it is so
pretty I don't want it to be like super
prominent it's kind of like a daytime
bande type look then nothing in the eye
is like too intense then I'm going to
take the color nude delight as our inner
corner highlight then we're going to
apply mascara this is from Miss sporty I
was obsessed with Miss Botti mascaras
back in the day and this one only cost
$1.99
now for my eyebrows just a bit I kind of
got wrong because I was under the
impression that this but Guertin color
was Matt and Matt Brown but it has the
tiny bit of shimmer but that is what
I've left been left with to do my brows
just taking that shade on angled brush
look how we Myers right if anything is
to come from this it is saved
I've noticed with a lot of drugstore
eyebrow products they're very warm like
then I've come yet to come across like a
cool tone brow pencil or anything when I
was younger my eyebrows used to be so
warm I don't know what it is so if you
have to ever ever ever invest your money
into anything I would say decent eyebrow
products unless you have warm heaven
lucky god don't like orange with
eyebrows done I'm going to take off the
tape I think that could have gone a lot
worse and that makes super easy and
every day you don't need to go all out
but now let's go onto skin let's clear
our hair out ball way right the
foundation I'm gonna use the Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless in the shade
220 you guys know I'm obsessed of this
foundation anyway I didn't realize it is
only $5.99 so this and the palette are
both the same price and kind of the most
expensive products that we've used in
this tutorial
just busting I thought because as you
can see like I haven't applied a primer
anything so I didn't want to wear a
foundation that I thought would have
like a luminous dewy finish because then
that is more likely not to stay on the
skin try to all get something that is of
a matte finish so it will last a lot
longer but this is probably one of my
favorite foundations anyways and the
fact that I can use it in this video and
it's so affordable is a bonus as such a
nice like coverage and finish to the
skin
and it's actually one of my favorite
ones too were on a night out anyways
like I said it's manner okay once that's
done we are going to go back to the
concealer that we use so like I said
this one I think was only one pound
fifty you sucked her knee and up oh I
shadow as well get it super sharp I can
already feel this like so watery but you
pay for what you guys suppose I'm just
getting a little brush and use that to
just really touch me go up and sharpen
up our eyeshadow and then I'm just
taking a sponge and blending that all in
okay this is definitely a concealer that
you have to work really fast with okay
so once you have applied all those
creams to your face I'm going back in
with the emulate Press Pass that we used
to set that on our consider on the eyes
earlier and this one was only this
almost only a parent so we're gonna and
it's in the kind of translucent because
I don't want to get like a specific
color in it be too warm or whatever he's
going to press that underneath the eye
actually really nice I feel like this is
a perfect powder to bring out like in
your collection and I out definitely
made the concealer look a lot nicer then
now that's set in place I'm going to go
in with the bronzer but first of all I
am going to just run this along our
lower lash line and then apply mascara
to the bottom lashes as well just to
finish off the island so this bronzer
again was only
a pound if you've got blue eyes like me
that that bronzer is make a nun pop I'm
gonna go in with a duo fiber brushes
because I don't want to apply too much
cuz it looks freaky and I don't want to
look like a brick a good way to make
sure it doesn't look too much okay we're
going to stop there with the bronzer and
we're going to go back in with that eye
shadow palette and mix the two lightest
colors together so new delight and gold
coin as our highlight I didn't get any
blusher because I'm a hundred percent
more of a blunder person I was kind of
running out of money I mean doubt um
there are palettes that have like our
shadows bronzers blushes and stuff in I
kind of want it to be I don't know it
just kind of didn't occur to me at the
time but if you're more of a blusher
person then invest more in the blushes
and bronzer if you're like me and wear
the bronzer I thought because I can use
that bronzer in my eyes as well all did
they've got not too bad I'm going to go
a bit more with the just apply bit more
of the gold coin color
okay onto let's does anybody know what
to pick I wasn't sure what kind of look
I was going for so I went for like a
whipped velvet lip color this is from
anyway and it's in the color Rocco I
think really nice light pink color and
it is only one pound fifty I think it's
originally three pounds but it was on
sale so do you like the look at this get
it now before it's not on sale I'm not
sure if the pigment of this either but
we'll just go with it okay so how God
smells really good though I kind of
thought this is going to be like their
NYX soft matte lip creams
but it's definitely not they did a few
other colors as well so and last but not
least from makeup revolution I got a
clear gloss but this really spoke to me
because it has like reflux of pink
through it and this was only one pound
and it is called their amazing lip gloss
in the shade crystal you guys know I
love a pop in glossy lips so I wasn't
not gonna get a glow oh god I hook it's
just picking mouth get to it smells it
refreshes like refresher sweet it
realistic came pretty sure that just
took off the other lip product I had on
underneath I think it looks really
pretty
so this is a closer
so this is the finished makeup look I
hope you liked it it definitely turned
out a lot better than I thought it would
in terms of like the finish and the
colors of some things definitely if I
was to go back and buy those things
again I wouldn't get the lip gloss and I
would invest in an eyebrow pencil
because my eyebrows I'm wondering that's
stressing out about this look fat I
think this is a really nice kind of even
though it's got that sharp cut thing I
think this is a really nice everyday
glam look and it cost me I think in
total 19 pounds 97 I mean there are some
things I missed out for example blusher
and a face primer so we'll see how this
lasts but other than that I think Ashley
if you're going back to school and like
you've spent all your money over summer
and you've got like a little bit of
pocket money left or whether definitely
check out some of these products they're
definitely a lot better than I thought
and it's making me see things in a
different light and making me definitely
be a lot more versatile with products
and multi-use things so really hope you

everyday glam look under 20 pounds make
