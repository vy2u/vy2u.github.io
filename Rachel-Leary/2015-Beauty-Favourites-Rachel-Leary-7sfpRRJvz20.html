today's video is kind of an all-round
favorites video of the year of 2015 for
beauty products and this is basically
just the products in 2015 that really
stood out to me and a favorites and I
used all year round and I would really
recommend that if you didn't try in 2015
you should definitely try in 2016 so
I'll try and put it in order kind of of
the face so I'm going to start off with
primers so I kind of based on like
products that I've repurchase the most
and just once that I feel if I didn't
have in my life I would really miss the
most so the 2 i've got two primers so
the first one is the l'oreal lumi
magique primer so i love about this one
is the fact that it kind of combines my
two like two favorite products of mine
and one so just obviously like a regular
primer and then Mac strobe cream if
you've heard of that it's a really
pearlescent moisturizer that looks
gorgeous under foundation and stuff like
that especially you've got quite dry
skin it gives a really nice glow but
obviously that on its own is just a
moisturizer so this gives a similar
finish to that moisturizer but it's got
priming qualities to it so obviously
your makeups and a last look longer and
give a really flawless of base so i love
this primer and the best thing is as
from l'oreal so it's super affordable as
well if you haven't tried this or you've
got quite dry skin and you're looking
for a really do it base i definitely
recommend this and this has been one of
my favorites the other primer is a
slightly different primer which is the
smashbox primer water so as you can see
I've nearly finished it and I can't
remember if I already bought one and
this is my second one but what I love
about this is like it's like a lazy girl
primer if you can't be bothered to I
know it's not even that much of a step
but if you really cut a bother to just
rub something into your face and stuff
like that this is amazing and just kind
of refreshing you waking you up and also
you know it's going to be doing good
because you're going to be priming a
skin at the same time as it being like
quite a refreshing mist so this has kind
of been a favorite for ages I also love
this before going to school just because
as soon as you wake up and you've got to
get ready if you took that extra 10
minutes to Lyon you've gotta speedily
get ready this is a real
really good primer just to really wake
you up and refresh you and then
obviously it's gonna leave a bit of a
tacky finish to the skin so anything
that you put on top it's going to help
last as well if you didn't try this or
you're quite lazy when it comes to your
skin care stuff like that I definitely
recommend this one and that is why it is
a favorite moving on to foundations are
there was definitely this has probably
definitely been the hardest category and
I narrowed it down from kind of one
high-end one-to-one drugstore ship drug
boots but over there once and i think i
just had to go off which 1i have the
most of and which one is my go-to always
know that it's going to look pretty nice
on my skin when i wear it and that is
the giorgio armani luminous silk
foundation i think over the course of
2015 i bought this in full shades i
bought it in the shade for 6 6.5 and
seven so 6 + 6.5 are kind of like my
daytime colors if I'm if I'm faked hand
which I normally am for is obviously
more of my paler shade and 77 has a
slightly different undertone 6 + 6.5 are
quite olive tone which I prefer 7 has
slept more warmth to the skin but kind
of mixing them together I found to get
like the perfect color but it is like my
absolute favorite foundation I was torn
between this and the Make Up For Ever HD
stick will the ultra HD stick because I
love that one as well but I've seen the
loads of people talk about their
favorite so I thought I'd do something a
little bit different I know this
foundations been around for ages and the
ultra HD stick came out in 2015 but I
think if I'm just collectively going off
my favorite foundations from a more
high-end perspective this one I know I'm
going to get a really flawless finish
you barely need any of it and it goes
such a long way on the skin so I found
they've really lost me I've not had to
repurchase a shade as of yet but I know
that I will this will always be a
favorite of mine and this and a damp
Beauty Blender just give the best face
ever i found and i love it so much it's
such a shame that it is quite an
expensive foundation and then i'm a
slightly cheaper end of the scale but
still i found to be one of like the best
found
nations anyway is l'oreal true match
recently they change the bottle to be
slightly more thinner which I really
appreciate in terms of storage and stuff
like that but what I love about this
foundation is it gives such a gorgeous
finish to the skin it's almost like a
satin finish it's not to do but it's not
super matte or anything like that so for
me when I have second what I think I
have kind of like more normal skin it's
never boilie but i do get shiny
sometimes depending on what I'm wearing
but it's not dry like I don't really
feel really dehydrated I feel like it
lasts a really long time on the skin and
like the giorgio armani when you barely
need any of it and it goes such a long
way and i know that they do such an
amazing color range in this foundation
as well which i can really appreciate in
terms of everyone being able to try it
if you've not tried the l'oreal true
match foundation and you're looking for
a more affordable foundation that still
gives you like a really expensive
foundation look to the skin I definitely
recommend this one too dry moving on to
concealer there was only one really
stand out once me and I think it came
out in 2015 and it is the urban decay
naked skin concealer so what I love
about this one is the coverage you get
such an amazing coverage but when it
goes onto the skin if you've tried it
you'll kind of know I'm talking about
but as it goes on to the skin it feels
really really lightweight and really
share but when you're buffing it into
your skin you're getting that color
payoff the coverage that you want I
wouldn't necessarily use this for like
spot treatment or anything like that but
like underneath your eyes and forehead
and chin and wherever you like to put it
I just finally get such a good coverage
the finish is not to do it I've not
found it to crease but I do normally
blend it out the damp Beauty Blender so
that does help to absorb any excess
product anyway but I've repurchased this
a few times to see a time absolutely in
love with it I'm quite tempted to get it
in like quite like a dark shade and try
it for cream contouring and stuff like
that because the formula of it is like I
said one of my favorites / consider and
I normally contour with darker shades of
concealer anyway so yeah this has
definitely been my standout concealer
for 2015 moving on to face powder again
I only have one product for this just
because nothing compared to it as soon
as I got inside using it I don't think
I've not used it since and there so I'm
deliberately trying to change up my
products and stuff for a video on a day
to day basis I wear this all the time
and it is the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in the shade diffused light so if
you've used any sort of products an
hourglass you know they give such a
gorgeous glow to the skin of really
airbrushed finish and kind of effortless
look this one underneath the eyes for me
it's been like a game changer I feel
like it brightens it looks so soft in
pictures and has not like glitter to it
or anything like that but it has like a
really iridescent finish and looks
absolutely like stunning over concealer
and stuff like that sometimes I'll set
it set my under eyes with just a regular
powder like a translucent powder or
something like that and then pressing
this over the top I find that lot I'm
getting the longevity of the powder and
stuff like that from the translucent one
underneath I'm getting there like most
amazing finish and like appearance to
the skin when I have this on the top so
for me this has been like the number one
powder for 2015 and probably will be for
ever and ever and ever moving on to
bronzer there wasn't one bronzer that
really specifically stood out to me just
because I worse like I get quite a few
quite often I try out loads so like Matt
give me some stuff like that all the
ones that you see me using my videos
they're all my favorites there's not
like one that specifically be like oh
that's the only bronze I would ever use
ever again like that kind of thing but I
did pick a bronzing product that I'm
absolutely in love with and at the
beginning of the year never put it down
and never not wear it just because it
gives such an amazing look to the skin
and that's the becca shimmering skin
Perfector and topaz so as you can see
I've completely hit pan on it and that's
kind of how I knew that was my favorite
bronzing product I would always and most
probably wear a matte bronzer underneath
so something like Matt give me son or
and like the NYC bronzer and stuff like
that but this just gives such a gorgeous
bronze glow to the skin on minimal
make-up days just using this to bronze
your skin and like the tops of your
forehead and stuff like that just looks
so stunning the formula of the back
shimmering skin Perfector zar incredible
like all of them have been standout
products me I do have one more down
there as well I'm sure you can probably
guess which one it is but this is well
over your like deck latasha area and let
your chest and stuff like that um it's
amazing on holiday I think this is when
I hit pan on it the most just because it
just looks so gorgeous over the skin and
if you know about these you know that
they're quite pigmented so if you are
slightly more than the fair aside topaz
is quite dark I'd be really quite
sparing you with it if you did want to
try it but like I said this is just such
a gorgeous bronzing kind of product it
is a bronzer like you can buy on its own
and I have done but to get kind of the
most out of it it looks stunning like
bronzer like your regular matte bronzer
this on top and a highlighter so moving
on to highlighters I've got two one I
think you all if you haven't tried it's
actually become a lot more accessible
now it was really like when it first
came out it was like gold dust it was
really hard to get hold of but now
because of the popularity of it you can
get it on called beauty and stuff like
that and that is the better shimmering
skin Perfector and Jaclyn hill
collaboration of champagne pop I think
Jaclyn did such an amazing job with this
one in the sense that the highlighted
will complement most skin tones it's
nothing too pearly and pearlescent that
only kind of Taylor's towards the more
fair our skins and stuff like that it's
got that golden undertone to it which is
going to complement all skin tones the
film the formula of it obviously as
always is so creamy and so pigmented on
the skin you barely need any of it and
you're going to be a beaming up from the
high heavens it's also really nice as
like a lid Shane it's of really nice
obviously champagne gold color which you
know is right up my street with some
warm colors in the crease and stuff like
that so I kind of get the most out this
product this has just definitely been a
standard product I love products that
are collaborations with people from
social media when you're on social media
doing Beauty you know what people are
looking for because you're looking for
the same thing so for her to come out
with like this theming gold highlighter
that's going to make you look like
you're okay
just radiating light she hit the nail on
the head with this one and that is why
it's one of my favorites but something
slightly more affordable the sleek
highlighting palette in saliste it comes
with 3 powder highlighting shades and
one cream highlighting shade the powder
highlighting shades are some of the like
one of the most pigmented highlighters
I've seen from like superdrug or boots
or like a drugstore brand they are so
let me switch so there's a really light
power one that's honestly once watch but
that's crazy it kind of reminds me of
opal from Becca it's that kind of color
or like mary-lou manizer by the bomb and
stuff like that the quality for a brand
that is so affordable is amazing as well
so that has definitely been one of my
favorites in terms of slightly more
affordable highlighter and convenience
are just pigmentation and I just
absolutely love this palette moving on
to I products going on too I shadows I
think two brands kind of stood out for
me over the course of 2015 and that has
been more fee and makeup geek in
particular from morphe the 350 palette I
think this just blew up for the brand in
the sense that it was for them I know
not everyone loves warm tones and stuff
like that but I feel most people do it's
their preferred choice of socket colors
and cruise colors and lid colors and
stuff like that it's something with a
warmer tone so this palette just kind of
was what everyone was looking for i
think the time that it came out in the
sub i think it was like the autumn time
was bang on in the sense that these are
all such all terminal colors and
obviously if you know me you know i'm
obsessed with warm colors so this
palette was literally a dream come true
and i'm pretty sure considering every
time that it's available it sells out in
like minutes that everyone else feels
the same as me and i feel for the the
price the pigmentation is phenomenal
they are some of the best I shadows I've
ever used I have quite a few more people
it's obviously this one is my favorite
in terms of color choice and all the
pigmentation is amazed
even through the matte shades and the
shimmery ones you're still getting
amazing pigmentation because i know
sometimes with more affordable brands
the matte shade stone the color payoff
isn't great but with these your game so
so so much for your money it has been a
super standout palette for me and i'm
absolutely in love with it and if you
managed to get it anything like that you
guys all know that it is amazing so
palette wise for eyes this has been my
favorite I think overall quality of
eyeshadows and just range of our shows
and stuff like that has to be makeup
geek this is my kind of custom-made look
everyday palette I'll do a close up for
you in here I've got like some matte
shade some of their foiled shadows and
stuff like that definitely some of their
foiled shadows I've been my favorite
like in the spotlight and whimsical
they're just so so so incredibly
pigmented for the price they're like six
dollars or something like that but they
are now available on cult beauty so
people from England or the UK or anyone
that has access to cult beauty they
stock all of their products on there and
even some of their new ones that they've
just come out within twenty sixteen or
it was even at the end of 2015 like the
new matte shadows the foiled shadows
like I said their pigments and they're
even their sparkless they've come out
with I think for 2015 I product wise I'm
out of their whole range have just been
stand out from makeup geek they're so
pigmented so affordable and a lot more
accessible now which I love a bit more
so it makes you feel a bit less guilty
for using them because otherwise they
you used to just be able to get them
from marlenas website but no for me
eyeshadows makeup geek hands down some
of the best like almost the best out
there some others stand out I products
me have been the Mac reflex glitters and
I know they haven't come out in just in
2015 they've been around forever but in
2015 I kind of got the kind of grips on
how to use them and they just look
phenomenal to finish off your eyeshadow
if you love glitter but not that kind of
really heavy I'm gonna need lash glue or
glitter adhesive glue to pack this on
glitter these
are amazing so these are just two of the
ones i have this is reflex bronze which
I'll see as you can see is like a pretty
sparkly golden coppery color and this
one is reflex gold so so you kind of
apply them by just pressing your brush
and your brush into the product you can
either spray the brush I find if you
spray your like kind of this little
distance your eyelids shut with mac fix+
and then press them on to the top you
just get that really gorgeous nothing
too heavy sparkle and to me I love
sparkly eyelids I love spicy smoky eyes
I love glitter in general these are like
the perfect products and I time and I
kind of fell in love of them in 2015 and
that's why they're my favorites and so
if you haven't already tried a Mac
reflex they do come out in holiday
collections it's like if you saw the
christmas collection there was like a
mini mac reflex bronze in one of them if
you do get the chance I definitely pick
up either one of the lighter ones like
reflex gold because this kind of goes
with any sort of warm look and just have
when the light hits it gives that kind
of gold glitter on top of anything that
you've already put down there's reflex
pearl as well which is kind of a staple
in the sense that pearl doesn't really
have like a specific color and kind of
goes with everything so yeah I
definitely recommend trying them if you
haven't already they would definitely
like favorite glittery I finishing
products for me 2015 even though
recently I've been tending towards gel
liner my stand out eyeliner for 2015
obviously is my NYC liquid 1 i'm pretty
sure there was a stage where in like
every tutorial that i did a winged liner
i was using this one and i even said you
guys like help me like i need to find a
new one that is just as good just
because I feel like I'm boring you got
us at the same eyeliner but NYC is such
an affordable brand from like your local
drugstore soup drug boots whatever the
formula of it doesn't crust or break the
brush is really good as well it's not
too thick it's not too flimsy it's just
the perfect eyeliner I find and really
really easy to use so if you struggle
with eyeliner I'd probably
probably recommend picking up this one
to begin with that this is definitely my
favorite and if you can watch my videos
for a while you know this is one of my
favorites and I basically used it
throughout the whole of 10 to 15 2015 i
think was like the year of the eyebrows
like so many brands came out with
eyebrow products like sets or just
general products it's such a competitive
market but for me there is to that just
a hands-down the best eyebrow products
that I've used obviously the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in medium brown
anastasia beverly hills is obviously the
queen of eyebrows that's how her kind of
cosmetics company launched and what
she's most famous for and the dip brows
and the brow Wiz is obviously are my
favorites and they've just cut there and
they've just come out with brow define
us as well which I've been loving I'm
wearing this soft brown one today so as
a company at a whole anastasia beverly
hills it's like the queen of brows but
obviously the brow / made is like quite
a unique product and i think has been
definitely like a brow game changer over
2015 and my other favorite product is
the brow archery pencil from soap and
glory in the shade hot chocolate this is
such an affordable dupe for the browse
by anastasia beverly hills formula of it
is so natural and so easy it's one of
those twisty up ones but with this when
you can twist it down so you don't waste
it I always bang on about how much I
love this product and I think for the
price of it it's such such an incredible
product which is definitely why it's one
of my favorites not to mention that i
friggin love the brand anyway for
eyelashes there's two brands that stood
out for me the most which are the lower
lashes and lily lashes the lower lashes
I am absolutely in love with them as a
brand and just the quality of them is
phenomenal this style of them like all
the different styles that they have as
well they accommodate for kind of every
kind of I look if you put your like
regular is it like synthetic lashes or
whatever is the ones that you can get
from like super drunk and stuff like
that and then you try a pair of matches
I swear you'll never want to use them
again there's no
then I use like our dells and stuff at
that all the time but just the
appearance of them is just so much more
natural and so much more just flattering
and stunning and I just absolutely i'm
in love of these throughout 2015 are
they made me one of their affiliates
with them and I've just their they're my
favorites for so many reasons and if you
haven't tried them yet definitely
definitely give them a go and the other
one that I said was Lily lashes I think
it's just because if this is kind of
blown up on social media all the kind of
celebrity makeup artists I they always
seem to be using lily lashes and they're
just so extra like they're just so full
and voluminous and so glam and I think
that just is Lilly ghalichi in like a
cosmetics product if that makes sense I
love the Miami stars and the Doha and
the recent pitch that I put on Twitter
I'm wearing the Miami lashes for the
people that were asking but yeah they
are just as good I love them moving on
to the final category of lips I've got a
few that i wanted to mention i think one
is just like liquid lipsticks as a whole
like the product of 2015 so so so many
brands came out with liquid lipsticks of
me there was kind of only one anastasia
beverly hills liquid lipsticks I think
pure Hollywood for me it's been one crap
is I'm gonna keep keep keep buying that
as long as they're making it um she sent
me one and then I brought my own one
like you can buy them from the Anastasia
Beverly Hills website via are from the
UK this shipping wasn't even that bad if
you want to try them I definitely
recommend them they are so creamy and so
pigmented and they last like the longest
time they're not drying at all on the
lips I know I've tried a few dat good
lipsticks where you put them on and then
you start to feel and kind of crust off
these don't do that after all like I
said they lost the longest time she has
so many colors these are only just a few
I've got like a whole tub of ones i
don't necessarily reach for the most
over there but yeah if you've not tried
an Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipstick that is what you need to do in
2016 because these I think what a lot of
people say
it's over 2015 and slightly more other
brand for lips that I became a fan of in
2015 and that is nick's cosmetics
obviously you guys know if you've been
watching my videos the nyx soft matte
lip cream in Cairo was is and it still
is a go to product for me for saying
that I can just work on really quickly
and I know it's going to really look
nice and they smell delicious as well so
that's specific shade of that matte lip
cream so if you're wanting to try if
you're kind of more scared to try like a
liquid lipstick but you want that kind
of effect these are really really nice
products and that Cairo is my fav their
butter glosses as well smell phenomenal
I don't know if it's just because all
the butter glosses are named after like
specific puddings so they're gonna smell
really sweet but fortune cookie and
creme brulee have been at some of my
favorites creme brulee off so you can
see a second more Pinker and a fortune
key is more of a nude super creamy super
buttery as kind of a butter gloss
implies and yet they're like a really
good everyday gloss also the lip pencil
in the shade nude beige has been stand
up for 2015 it kind of goes with all my
nudes and it's really good if you wanna
like overlong your lip as well because
it's quite cool in tone so it actually
looks more like a shadow and more
natural and I feel like that's
definitely pinner 2015 trend baby 2015
I've loved most of the stuff that they
have and it's so affordable as well and
it's become a lot more accessible like
they sell it in Selfridges &amp;amp; boots or
sea and stuff like that so if you've not
tried anything from nicks I definitely
recommend trying their lip products the
final makeup lip product anything of
2015 that was kind of more of the end of
2015 for me as you guys know was the
Kylie lip kits I'm not sure if she said
it's like I got sent them because every
order I put through it like never
actually went through or it did actually
go through and I got them I'm not sure
all I know is that I never expected to
ever have them ever in my life and the
fact i have them lose my mind and i am
so so happy that I do because I'm more
of a fan of the pencils that I am the
liquid lipsticks and liquid lipsticks
are a bit
I in for me the pencils though the
shades she's got them bang on Dolce K
pencil is like my favorite lip pencil
now of all time so I'm trying to use
this sparingly as i can so no i'm
probably never ever going to be able to
repurchase it ever again possess quite
hard to get hold of so I'm 26 I think in
2016 hopefully maybe it'll probably be
towards the end or like the middle
because right now these are so popular
you'll be able to get your hands on them
too but the colors and they smell
incredible as well they smell like
chocolate and sweets and stuff like that
so if you can in 2016 definitely try and
get your hands on these they are
phenomenal product I think just for the
colors the packaging the smell and stuff
like that these have been even though
there are more towards the end some of
my favorite lip products of 2015 as well
so that is all my beauty makeup
favorites for 2015 I thought just at the
end I would throw in my favorite
fragrance which for me has been Jimmy
Choo blossom of everything I have I
think this one is always a go to one
that I know that I always get
compliments on what I wear and people
say like oh you smell really like candy
and stuff like that and it tends to be
this that I'm wearing when people say
that it's really really quite sweet if
you're more like a floral natural clean
scent you'll probably find this is way
too intense because like I said it is
really sweet but that is the kind of
smell that I'd go for and just
absolutely longer that this is the
smaller one they do a big one as well
and I think when I run out of this I'm
going to invest in the big one just
because I wear it so often but feels
really handy to carry around in your
like handbagging this has been my
standout favorite fragrance of 2015 so
as the end of this video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and I are inspired
me to try some new products in 2016 that
you hadn't tried as well I be guys found
it interesting the kind of products that
I've been loving over the year and I
can't wait to see what kind of new
products i'm gonna fall in love with
over twenty sixteen sorry that this
didn't go up yesterday instead of today
yesterday i just ran out of trauma the
