today's video is kind of an all round
favourites video of the year of 2015 for
beauty products and this is basically
just the products in 2015 that really
stood out to me and a favorites and I
used all year round and I would really
recommend that if you didn't try in 2015
you should definitely try in 2016 so
I'll try and put it in order kind of of
the face so I'm gonna start off with
primers so I kind of based on like
products that I've repurchase the most
and just ones that I feel if I didn't
have in my life I would really miss the
most
so the two I've got two appointments so
the first one is the L'Oreal Lumi
magique primer so what I love about this
one is the fact that it kind of combines
my two like two favorite products of
mine and one so just obviously like a
regular primer and then Mac strobe cream
if you've heard of that it's a really
pearlescent moisturizer that looks
gorgeous under foundation and stuff like
that especially you've got quite dry
skin it gives a really nice glow but
obviously that on its own is just a
moisturizer so this gives a similar
finish to that moisturizer but it's got
priming qualities to it so obviously
your makeups on a last look longer and
give a really flawless of base so I love
this primer and the best thing is that's
from L'Oreal so it's super affordable as
well if you haven't tried this or you've
got quite dry skin and you're looking
for a really dewy at base I definitely
recommend this and this has been one of
my favorites the other primer is a
slightly different primer which is the
Smashbox primer water so as you can see
I've nearly finished it and I can't
remember if I already bought one and
this is my second one but what I love
about this is like it's like a lazy girl
primer if you can't be bothered to I
know it's not even that much of a step
but if you really can't bother to just
rub something into your face and stuff
like that this is amazing I just kind of
refreshing you waking you up and also
you know it's gonna be doing good
because you're gonna be priming your
skin at the same time as it being like
quite a refreshing mist so if this has
kind of been a favorite for ages I still
love this before going to school just
because as soon as you wake up and
you've got to get ready if you took that
extra 10 minutes to lie in you've got a
speedily get ready this is a
really good primer just to really wake
you up and refresh you and then
obviously it's gonna leave a bit of a
tacky finish to the skin so with
anything that you put on top it's gonna
help last as well if you didn't try this
or you're quite lazy when it comes to
your skincare and stuff like that I
definitely recommend this one and that
is why it is moving on to foundations
are there was definitely this has
probably definitely been at the hardest
category and I narrowed it down from
kind of one high-end one to one
drugstore zip drive boots remember there
once and I think I just had to go off
which one I have the most of and which
one is my go-to always know that it's
gonna look pretty nice on my skin when I
wear it and that is the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I think over
the course of 2015
I bought this in four shades I bought it
in the shade four six six point five and
seven so six and six point five are kind
of like my daytime colors if I'm if I'm
fake tan which I normally and four is
obviously more of my paler shade and 7/7
has a slightly different undertone
six and six point five are quite olive
toned which I prefer seven has like more
warmth to the skin but kind of mixing
them together I found to get like the
perfect color but it is like my absolute
favorite foundation I was torn between
this and the Make Up For Ever HD stick
all the ultra HD stick because I love
that one as well but I've seen those
people talk about that in a favorite so
I thought I'd do something a little bit
different I know this foundations been
around for ages and the ultra HD stick
came out in 2015 but I think if I'm just
collectively going off my favorite
foundations from a more high-end
perspective this one I know I'm gonna
get a really flawless finish you barely
need any of it and it goes such a long
way on the skin so I found they've
really lost me I've not had to
repurchase a shade as of yet but I know
that I will this will always be a
favorite of mine and this and a damp
Beauty Blender just give the best face
ever I found and I love it so much
it's such a shame that it is quite an
expensive foundation and then I'm a
slightly cheaper end of the scale but
still I found to be one of like the best
anyway is l'oreal true match recently
they changed the bottle to be slightly
more thinner which i really appreciate
in terms of storage and stuff like that
but what I love about this foundation is
it gives such a gorgeous finish to the
skin it's almost like a satin finish
it's not to do but it's not super matte
or anything like that so for me when I
have slightly more I think I have kind
of like more normal skin it's never oily
but I do get shiny sometimes depending
on what I'm wearing but it's not dry
like I don't really feel really
dehydrated
I feel like it lasts a really long time
on the skin and like the Giorgio Armani
one you barely need any of it and it
goes such a long way and I know that
they do such an amazing color range in
this foundation as well which I can
really appreciate in terms of everyone
being able to try it so if you've not
tried the L'Oreal true match foundation
and you're looking for a more affordable
foundation that still gives you like a
pretty expensive foundation look to the
skin
I definitely recommend this one to dry
moving on to concealer there was only
one really stand out one for me and I
think it came out in 2015 and it is the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer so what
I love about this one is the coverage
you get such an amazing coverage but on
when it goes onto the skin if you've
tried it you're kind of know I'm talking
about as it goes on to the skin it feels
really really lightweight and really
share but when you're buffing it into
your skin you're getting that color
payoff the coverage that you want
I wouldn't necessarily use this for like
spot treatment or anything like that but
like underneath your eyes and forehead
and chin and wherever you like to put it
I just finally get such a good coverage
the finish is not to do it I've not
found it to crease but I do normally
blend it out with a damp Beauty Blender
so that does help to absorb any excess
product anyway but I've repurchased this
a few times this year I'm absolutely in
love with it I'm quite tempted to get it
in like quite like a dark shade and try
it for cream contouring and stuff like
that because the formula of it is like I
said one of my favorites for concealer
and I normally contour with darker
shades of concealer anyway so yeah this
is definitely been at my stand out
concealer for 2015 moving on to face
powder again I only have one product for
this just because nothing compared to it
as soon as I've got inside using it I
don't think
not used it since unless I'm
deliberately trying to change up my
products and stuff for a video but on a
day to day basis I wear this all the
time and it is the hourglass ambient
lighting powder in the shade diffused
light so if you've used any sort of
products an hourglass you know they give
such a gorgeous glow to the skin of
really airbrushed finish and kind of
effortless look this one underneath the
eyes for me it's been like a
game-changer I feel like it brightens it
looks so soft in pictures and has not
like glitter to it or anything like that
but it has like a really iridescent
finish and looks absolutely like
stunning over concealer and stuff like
that sometimes I'll set it set my under
eyes with just a regular powder like a
translucent powder or something like
that and then pressing this over the top
I find that lot I'm getting the
longevity of the powder and stuff like
that from the translucent one underneath
but I'm getting there like the most
amazing finish and like appearance to
the skin when I have this on the top so
for me this has been like the number one
powder for 2015 and probably will be
forever and ever and ever
moving on to bronzer there wasn't one
bronzer that really specifically stood
out to me just because I Wes like I'm
get quite a few quite often I try out
those so like matte give me Sun and
stuff like that all the ones that you
see me using my videos they're all my
favorites there's not like one that
specifically be like oh that's the only
bronzer I would ever use ever again like
that kind of thing but I did pick a
bronzing product that I'm absolutely in
love with and at the beginning of the
year never put it down and never not
wear it just because it gives such an
amazing look to the skin and that's the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector and
topaz so as you can see I've completely
hit pan on it and that's kind of how I
knew that was my favorite bronzing
product I would always and most probably
wear a matte bronzer underneath so
something like matte give me Sun or like
the NYC bronzer and stuff like that but
this just gives such a gorgeous bronze
glow to the skin on minimal makeup days
just using this to bronze your skin and
like the tops of your forehead and stuff
like that just looks so stunning the
formula of the
the shimmering skin perfecter czar
incredible like all of them have been
standout products me I do have one more
down there as well I'm sure you can
probably guess which one it is but this
is well over your like decolletage area
and let your chest and stuff like that
it's amazing on holiday I think this is
when I hit pan on it the most just
because it just looks so gorgeous over
the skin if you know about these you
know that they're quite pigmented so if
you ask slightly more on the fair aside
topaz is quite dark I'd be really quite
sparing you with it if you did want to
try it but like I said this is just such
a gorgeous bronzing kind of product it
is a bronzer like you can buy on its own
and I have done but to get kind of the
most out of it it looks stunning
like bronzer like your regular matte
bronzer this on top and a highlighter so
moving on to highlighters I've got two
one I think you all if you haven't tried
it's actually become a lot more
accessible now it was really like when
it first came out it was like gold dust
it was really hard to get hold of but
now because of the popularity of it you
can get it on court beauty and stuff
like that and that is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector and Jaclyn
hill collaboration of champagne pop I
think Jaclyn did such an amazing job
with this one in the sense that the
highlighter will complement most skin
tones it's nothing too pearly and
pearlescent that only kind of Taylor's
towards the more fairest skins and stuff
like that it's got that golden undertone
to it which is gonna complement all skin
tones the film the formula of it
obviously as always is so creamy and so
pigmented on the skin you barely need
any of it and you're gonna be a beaming
up from the high heavens it's also
really nice it's like a lid shade it's a
pretty nice obviously champagne gold
color which you know is right up my
street with some warm colors in the
crease and stuff like that so I kind of
get the most out of this product this
has just definitely been a standard
product I love products that are
collaborations with people from social
media when you're on social media doing
Beauty you know what people are looking
for because you're looking for the same
thing so hard to come out with like this
themeing bold highlighter
that's gonna make you look like you're
thank you
just radiating light she hit the nail on
the head with this one and that is why
it's one of my favorites but something
slightly more affordable
the sleek highlighting palette in
saliste it comes with three powder
highlighting shades and one cream
highlighting shade the powder
highlighting shades are some of the like
one of the most pigmented highlighters
I've seen from like superdrug or boots
or like a drugstore brand they are so
let me swatch so there's a really light
power one that's honestly one swatch but
that's crazy it kind of reminds me of
opal from Becca it's that kind of color
or like mary lou manizer by the balm and
stuff like that the quality for a brand
that is so affordable is amazing as well
so that has definitely been one of my
favorites in terms of slightly more
affordable highlighter and convenience
are just pigmentation and I just
absolutely love this palette moving on
to eye products going onto eyeshadows I
think two brands kind of stood out for
me over the course of 2015 and that has
been morphe and makeup geek in
particular from morphe the 35o palette I
think this just blew up for the brand in
the sense that it was I know not
everyone loves warm tones and stuff like
that but I feel most people do it's
their preferred choice of socket colors
and cruise colors and live colors and
stuff like that is something with a
warmer tone so this palette just kind of
was what everyone was looking for I
think the time that it came out in the
store I think it was like the autumn
time was bang on in the sense that these
are all such all terminal colors and
obviously if you know me you know I'm
obsessed with warm colors so this
palette was literally a dream come true
and I'm pretty sure considering every
time that it's available it sells out in
like minutes
that everyone else feels the same as me
and I feel for the the price the
pigmentation is phenomenal they are some
of the best eyeshadows I've ever used I
have quite a few more few pallets
obviously this one is my favorite in
terms of color choice and all the
pigmentation is amazing evening
the matte shades and the shimmery ones
you're still getting amazing
pigmentation because I know sometimes
with more affordable brands the matte
shade stone the color payoff isn't great
but with these you're getting so so so
much for your money it has been a super
standout palette for me and I'm
absolutely in love with it and if you
managed together anything like that you
guys will know that it is amazing so
palette wise for eyes this has been my
favorite I think overall quality of
eyeshadows and just range of our shows
and stuff like that has to be makeup
geek this is my kind of custom-made look
everyday palette I'll do a close-up for
you in here I've got like some matte
shades some of their foiled shadows and
stuff like that
definitely some of their foiled shadows
I've been my favorite like in the
spotlight and whimsical they're just so
so so incredibly pigmented for the price
they're like six dollars or something
like that but they are now available on
cult Beauty so people from England or
the UK or anyone that has access to cult
Beauty they stock all of their products
on there and even some of their new ones
that they've just come out with in 2016
or it was even at the end of 2015
like their new matte shadows the foiled
shadow is like I said their pigments and
their even their sparklers they've come
out with I think for 2015 I product wise
out of their whole range have just been
stand out from makeup geek they're so
pigmented so affordable and a lot more
accessible now which I love a bit more
so it makes you feel a bit less guilty
for using them because otherwise they
you you used to just be able to get them
from marlenas website but you know for
me I shadows makeup geek hands down some
of the best like almost the best out
there some others stand out by products
me have been the Mac reflex glitters and
I know they haven't come out in just in
2015 they've been around forever but in
2015 I kind of got the kind of grips on
how to use them and they just look
phenomenal to finish off your eyeshadow
if you love glitter but not that kind of
really heavy I'm gonna need lash glue or
glitter adhesive glue to pack this on
glitter these are amazing
so these are just two of the ones I have
this is reflex bronze which I'll see as
you can see is like a pretty sparkly
golden capri color and this one is
reflex gold so so you kind of apply them
by just pressing your brush and your
brush into the product you can either
spray the brush I find if you spray your
like kind of this little distance your
eyelids shut with mac fix+ and then
press them onto the top you just get
that really gorgeous nothing too heavy
Sparkle and to me I love sparkly eyelids
I love spicy smoky eyes I love glitter
in general these are like the perfect
products and items and I kind of fell in
love of them in 2015 and that's why
they're my favorites and so if you
haven't already tried a Mac reflex they
do come out in holiday collections it's
like if you saw the Christmas collection
there was like a mini Mac reflex bronze
in one of them if you do get the chance
I definitely pick up either one of the
lighter ones like reflex gold because
this kind of goes with any sort of warm
look and just have when the light hits
it gives that kind of gold glitter on
top of anything that you've already put
down
there's reflex pearl as well which is
kind of a staple in the sense that pearl
doesn't really have like a specific
color and kind of go through everything
so yeah I definitely recommend trying
them if you haven't already they would
definitely like favorite glittery eye
finishing products for me of 2015
even though recently I've been tending
towards gel liner my stand out eyeliner
for 2015 obviously is my NYC liquid one
I'm pretty sure there was a stage where
in like every tutorial that I did a
winged liner I was using this one and I
even said you guys like helped me like I
need to find a new one that is just as
good just because I feel like I'm boring
you guys at the same eyeliner but NYC is
such an affordable brand from like your
local drugstore soup jug boots whatever
the formula of it doesn't crust or break
the brush is really good as well it's
not too thick it's not too flimsy it's
just the perfect eyeliner I find and
really really easy to use so if you
struggle with eyeliner
I'd probably definitely recommend
picking up this one so
this is definitely my favorite and if
you watch my videos for a while you know
this is one of my favorites and I
basically used it throughout the whole
of 2015 2015 I think was like the year
of the eyebrows like so many brands came
out with eyebrow products like sets or
just general products it's such a
competitive market but for me there is
two that just are hands down the best
eyebrow products that I've used
obviously the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow in medium brown anastasia
beverly hills is obviously the queen of
eyebrows that's how her kind of
cosmetics company launched and what
she's most famous for and the dip brows
and the brow wiz is obviously are my
favorites and they've just cut this and
they've just come out with brow defined
this as well which I've been loving I'm
wearing the soft brown one today so as a
company and a whole Anastasia Beverly
Hills it's like the queen of brows but
I've seen the brow pomade is like quite
a unique product and I think has been
definitely a brow game changer over 2015
and my other favorite product is the
brow archery pencil from soap &amp;amp; Glory in
the shade hot chocolate this is such an
affordable dupe for the brows by
Anastasia Beverly Hills formula of it is
so natural and so easy it's one of those
twisty up ones but with this one you can
twist it down so you don't waste it
I always bang on about how much I love
this product and I think for the price
of it it's such such an incredible
product which is definitely why it's one
of my favorites not to mention that I
freaking love the brand anyway for
eyelashes there's two brands that stood
out for me the most which are the lower
lashes and Lily lashes the lower lashes
I am absolutely in love with them as a
brand and just the quality of them is
phenomenal
this style of them like all the
different styles that they have as well
they accommodate for kind of every kind
of ilyich if you put your like regular
is it like synthetic lashes or whatever
is the ones that you can get from like
super dragon stuff like that and then
you try a pair of matches I swear you'll
never want to use them again there's
nothing wrong with them I use like our
Dells and stuff at that all the time but
just the EPI
some of them it's just so much more
natural and so much more just flattering
and stunning and I just absolutely I'm
in love with these throughout 2015
are they made me one of their affiliates
with them and I've just they're I mean
they're my favorites for so many reasons
and if you haven't tried them yet
definitely definitely give them a go and
the other one that I said was Lily
lashes I think it's just because if this
is kind of blown up on social media all
the kind of celebrity makeup artists and
they always seem to be using Lily lashes
and they're just so extra like they're
just so full and voluminous and so glam
and I think that just is Lilly ghalichi
in like a cosmetics product did that
make sense
I love the Miami stars and the Doha and
the recent pitch that I put on Twitter
I'm wearing the Miami lashes for the
people that were asking but yeah they
are just as good I mean none of them
moving on to the final category of lips
I've got a few that I wanted to mention
I think one is just like me liquid
lipsticks as a whole like the product of
2015 so so so at many brands came out
with liquid lipsticks of me there was
kind of only one Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipsticks I think pure Hollywood
for me has been one prop is I'm gonna
keep keep keep buying that as long as
they're making it she sent me one and
then I brought my own one like you can
buy them from the Anastasia Beverly
Hills website if you are from the UK
this shipping wasn't even that bad so if
you want to try them I definitely
recommend them they are so creamy and so
pigmented and they last like the longest
time they're not drying at all on the
lips I know I've tried a few dat good
lipsticks where you put them on and then
you start to feel them kind of crust off
these don't do that at all
like I said they lost the longest time
she has so many colors these are only
just a few I've got like a whole tub of
ones that I don't necessarily reach for
the most over there but yeah if you've
not tried an Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick that is what you need to
do in 2016 because these I think what a
lot of people's favorite
it's over 2015 it's slightly more of a
brand for lips that I became a fan of in
2015 and that is NYX Cosmetics obviously
you guys know if you've been watching my
videos the NYX soft matte lip cream in
Cairo was is and it still is a go-to
product for me for saying that I can
just work on really quickly and I know
it's gonna really look nice and they
smell delicious as well so that's
specific shade of that matte lip cream
so if you're wanting to try if you're
kind of more scared to try like a liquid
lipstick but you want that kind of
effect these are really and brilliant
nice products and that cairo is my fave
their butter glosses as well smell
phenomenal i don't know if it's just
because all the butter glosses are named
after like specific puddings so they're
gonna smell really sweet but fortune
cookie and creme brulee have been at
some of my favorites creme brulee off so
you can see a slightly more Pinker and a
fortune cookie is more of a nude super
creamy super buttery as kind of a butter
gloss implies and yet they're like of
really good everyday gloss also the lip
pencil in the shade nude beige has been
stand up for 2015 it kind of goes with
all my nudes and it's really good if you
wanna like over line your lip as well
because it's quite cool in tone so it
actually looks more like a shadow and
more natural and I feel like that's
definitely been in 2015 trend maybe 2015
I've loved most of the stuff that they
have and it's so affordable as well and
it's become a lot more accessible like
they sell it in Selfridges and Boots
obviously and stuff like that so if
you've not tried anything from NYX I
definitely recommend that trying their
lip products the final makeup lip
product anything of 2015 that was kind
of more of the end of 2015 for me as you
guys know was the Kylie lip kit I'm not
sure if she said oh it's like I got sent
them because every order I put through
it like never actually went through or
it didn't actually go through and I got
them I'm not sure all I know is that I
never expected to ever have them ever in
my life and the fact I have them lose my
mind and I am so so happy that I do
because I'm more of a fan of the pencils
that I am the liquid lipsticks and
liquid lipsticks are a bit dry
for me the pencils though the shades
she's got them bang on Dolce K pencil is
like my favorite lip pencil now of all
time so I'm trying to use this as
sparingly as I can so no I'm probably
never ever gonna be able to repurchase
it ever again
cuz that's quite hard to get hold of so
I'm 26 I think in 2016
hopefully maybe it'll probably be
towards the end or at the middle cuz
right now these are so popular you'll be
able to get your hands on them too but
the colors and they smell incredible as
well they smell like chocolate and
sweets and stuff like that so if you can
in 2016
definitely try and get your hands on
these they are phenomenal product I
think just for the colors the packaging
the smell and stuff like that these have
been even though they were more towards
the end some of my favorite lip products
of 2015 as well so that is all my beauty
makeup favorites for 2015 I thought just
at the end I would throw in my favorite
fragrance which for me has been Jimmy
Choo blossom of everything I have I
think this one is always a go-to one
that I know that I always get
compliments on what I wear and people
say like oh you smell really like candy
and stuff like that and it tends to be
this that I'm wearing when people say
that it's really really quite sweet if
you're more like a floral natural clean
scent you'll probably find this is way
too intense because like I said it is
really sweet but that is the kind of
smell that I'd go for and just
absolutely loving it this is the smaller
one they do a big one as well and I
think when I run out of this I'm gonna
invest in the big one just cuz I wear it
so often but it sounds really handy to
carry around in your like ham bagging
this has been my standout favorite
fragrance of 2015 so as the end of this
video I really hope you guys enjoyed it
and are inspired me to try some new
products in 2016 that you haven't tried
as well I hope you guys found it
interesting the kind of products that
I've been loving over the year and I
can't wait to see what kind of new
products I'm gonna fall in love with
over 2016 sorry that this didn't go up
