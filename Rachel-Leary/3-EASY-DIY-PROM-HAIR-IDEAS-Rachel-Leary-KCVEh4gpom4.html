you
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
that so many of you guys asked me to do
this and I'm so excited to be doing this
for you today because this video is in
collaboration with whether shockwave and
I have teamed up with damn it to show
you these three DIY prom attire
tutorials and like ideas if you're doing
your hair yourself for your prom so I'm
going to be showing you how to achieve
the three half of LeSueur in the intro
and it'd be a perfect fit styling
products to be using them all from
weather shock waves with the nude size
down don't you have to remain that way
all the day not in place the style hold
and just flip the best I can and I feel
like you're going to achieve that with
all the products that I've used I've
listed them all it down below if you
guys if you want to check them out
obviously don't necessarily use the
products just a problem if you have baby
head like me all the time some of these
products in here are perfect for that on
a day to day basis so yes if you like
the look of this video then definitely
make sure to give a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already done
yet if you want to see how to achieve
the hair felt that you saw in the
beginning and what products I used to do
so then please keep watching okay so the
first pallet that we're going to do is
this one right here so I'm kind of
typical smaller sized cutting box I want
the curls to be quite tight we're going
to kind of make the middle bit like a
looser and more kind of feature with the
products that we're going to use so
first of all we're going to separate our
hair give it a little brush through I
always end up doing like three or four
layers of hacks that way I feel like
you're getting the most out of it and
you're getting a more Calvin so I
personally always like to curl away from
my face as you guys have probably
noticed I'm going to live I'm going to
be taking like a medium sized chunks and
then you as I said just kind of curling
away from my face and holding each curl
there for like so I just tend they're
good because I've got on quite a high
heat like that and just making our way
around
you got one like that if you want to
kind of more beachy r-wave I would kind
of alternate the way that I was doing it
so I'd do one away from my face and then
one towards my face Matt when you're
going to get a lot more volume
so again just repeating the process on
the other side with medium sized chunks
and just curling away
then at once you've kind of done your
first layer and you're going to do this
on every layer I need me taking the away
no shockwave ultra strong power hold
hairspray I don't think what this is
going to do it's going to hold all the
cards in place so I'm only going to be
spraying lightly this is such an amazing
hairspray in the sense it going to hold
everything in place but I do want to
brush it all out I don't want them to
drop kind of while what curling is that
makes sense so I'm just going to let you
spray them now and what's good about
that hair braids is keep it easy to
brush out as well so it's not like so so
so strong that gives you that kind of
crunchy feel it's like strong but I can
easily brush through someone's you've
done that there we can just throw it
back I do actually kind of like to tie
it back so it I know like that but those
bits are curled and done I'm not going
to curl them again so now I'm just going
to create a another layer with my hair
kind of middle sections if you will and
we're just going to repeat the process
again
little song to show you so I'm just
finishing up the kind of last bit on the
last layer I always like to make sure
that the kind of bits that frame my face
are a hundred percent curl away and I'm
just going to lightly spray there's
something about just having your hair
cut that always feels so damn so now one
can do is actually just lightly a brush
through them or through the curls with a
comb they all kind of stayed really well
in place you get sprayed each layer but
now what I'm going to do is actually
kind of take the front portion about
this much and just braid it back because
I think braids are just realist and
pretty flat for more occasions I'm just
gonna not like a French plat or anything
you got one like that and I'm going to
take a little bobby pin just to hold
that in place kind of like that and do
the same on this side so just taking a
medium chunk of that could be the front
part of your hair sliding it backwards
I'm going to make sure that I leave like
some of the curls at the end because
it's not staying in the clip forever on
the sides I'm going to do is take a thin
hair band and then just take the clip
out and then we're just gonna use here
the back here just tie it back so you
could bring like a little bit down
I feel like this just creates a super
pretty kind of effortless look perfect
for prom but just to make sure that
everything is kind of all a lot and give
it a bit more of an undone textured look
I need to be taking the weather shock
waves textured gum which is literally a
little cream like this and like I said
what this is going to do it's going on a
lot the kind of style that you've got
going on but make it still kind of
remould herbal and give you more like an
undone and tousled look if that's a kind
of a bit going with and then I'm also
doing it just in the front of my hair to
make sure everything is kind of locked
down in place because even little baby
have liked me but don't want it to look
like a gel look this is perfect so I'm
just going to take a little bit on my
fingers and kind of rub it through then
just run my fingers through it and kind
of scrunch them up getting like a bit
more like a volume and lift you can see
it's just kind of made it locked in
place that's still looking really like
I've not got like a lot of Proctor and
then just taking a little bit through
the front and just like on the tops of
my hair to get rid of any kind of
flyaways or maybe has you guys know like
in the humidity day like that yeah
if you're not wanting less completely
slicked back look then a product like
this is going to look everything down
but without feeling or looking like that
gel effect you know so this is the first
look finish using it the ultra sonic
power hold hairspray Andy at Extra gum
the texture gum is going to make sure
that these curls kind of stay in place
but without feeling too kind of covered
in product and give a more undone look
also taming those flyaways and this is
going to make sure that everything was
locked in place but not feeling super
sticky and stiff literally obsessed with
this episode is so easy and
so as that list but looks really put
together and you want your head down
then this is the way you can do that
okay so the next list that we're going
to do is this one my hair so a brilliant
super pretty up do you want loads of
volume for this look and also we want it
to look in place so our hair kind of
already curled I probably will get back
in a retail fun bit like I said it first
things first we won't load a lot of
volume in our hair so that I'm going to
take via curls and waves mousse
now this I find you can use on a dry and
damp hair if you wanted loads and loads
and loads of volume definitely use this
on like towel dried hair I try it while
it's still wet and then when you blow
dry your hair will be left with a super
really minute hair kind of ready to go
I'm actually gonna be taking a little
bit and applying it onto dry hair that
way I find the powder bit more crunchy
easy to mold with still getting loads of
volume like at the root which is what we
want to this updo so this is going to be
a perfect for this look like I said just
kind of taking a little bit like this
rubbing it on my fingers I'm just kind
of like applying it through and like
mainly I like the roots of my hair
you're going to add a bit more
definition to the curls in it as well
but she's going to give us a really good
kind of body of hair to work with oh
okay so now they're going to take the
curved front fringe bit but not the kind
of big as before we were doing the plat
which is kind of like medium sized and
that's like this then I also I'm just
going to take a little bit down gonna
hair as well you know we're just gonna
tie the rest of our hair back up into a
super high ponytail on the top of our
head like so
now this is where it gets super DIY you
could use a hair bun I'm going to take a
sock because I didn't ever have one I've
kind of put a sock inside a sock bend it
around and kind of put it back inside
itself that make sense if I make my own
sock I mean to make my own hair bun and
I'm going to put this just around like
the top you can just leave the Halleck
this but I'm just going to kind of mold
my hair like a rounder if that makes
sense the full roll out and then kind of
just wrap everything around you
obviously make sure that you can't see
the silk and just take a pin and pin
that in place so this is kind of like
unmasked updo so I am going to kind of
pull a little bit out I almost obviously
like a Messier the better which is why
that makes pretty house I am just going
to recover with the front there
just kind of I kind of want this to look
more like a the messy but put together
was like we just signed Carl to the
front but once you're happy with
everything went to lock in at place now
you could just use regular hairspray but
because we've got like an actual item in
my hair I literally want it to look and
stay all day so I'm actually going to
spray my hair with the shockwave ultra
strong at power hold gel spray so I
don't want MC as gels like stick
everything back but I want the same
power as that gel but what this is going
to do is literally just kind of add
structure and like hold your style and
because you've got a lot going on it's
going to be the perfect product so
obviously this is the finished hairstyle
again I still think that was super easy
I mean you just curl your hair grab a
couple of socks what do you got the
right styling products as well so Tom do
you want a good base for this kind of
voluminous look so using the curls and
waves mousse is perfect value adding
that volume at the root but also
defining our curls at the same time and
we've locked everything in place now
with the ultra strong power hold gel
spray because we've got a lot going on
and we've got a lot of structure and
we'll hold this style that I'll make
sure that you're using the right stuff
yeah I feel like different a super kind
of effortless everything so I suppose
have you noticed the super pretty kind
of messy updo but now I will show you
how to a bit more of a Slick Rick updo
so for the final look I'm going to show
you how to get this look right here
again another updo but this time a
little bit more of a formal look more of
a Slick Rick look and this is actually
the look that I wore one of my prom
makeup tutorials and those of you are
asking me about doing hair tutorials so
I definitely wanted to include it in
this one so again this one is super easy
what we're going to do is tie our hair
up into a really high ponytail
like so and now because we want that
slick look I'm going to go in with a gel
and this is B but when a shockwave is
ultra strong at power hold gel but ultra
stronger formula of this is going to
really help kids like structure to other
and it's going to really hold and lock
everything down in in place but it's not
going to give a greasy look it's just
going to look styled and slip back not
greasy and what I actually like to do is
drizzle like the time flag it just
across a comb pull like so we're going
to work it into the kind of an order
kind of spent to the front of our house
and just close up and then you can use
your hands kind of like the rest of the
path not a baby hair inside then I am
going to backcomb kind of the root of
the ponytail and then once you've a
background that you just want to twirl
it around like so and then just tie it
and sleep like that and then just going
to spray the burner with the ultra
strong hairspray as well so his eyes
look in place up here this is like a
super kind of slicked back look but it's
all it's full-on exactly not to fall
because the bottom the top is kind of
messy but everything else is slicked
back and we know it's missing tape
because it using a gel like this it is
super long-lasting so perfect kind of
product for Chrome you're going for a
slick fabulous and especially if you
have a baby house like me this works a
dream so that is how I achieved those
three DIYs from hairstyle using those
