slightly different video today today I'm
showing you my tips and tricks for what
products I use it to create these three
curves summer and beachy inspired hair
looks that we'll see you saw in the
intro and what makes this view even more
summer and be inspired and appropriate
is that this video is in collaboration
with runners shock waves as they have
partnered with the new at Baywatch
really in cinemas on a mayor 29th 2017
they have bought out three and
limited-edition kind of packaging
versions of their top or best selling
hero products which you can get from
Superdrug from the beginning of May at
to the end of July so if you like a
limited edition at packaging Budhan
definitely make sure it take to get your
hands on them from co-driver just links
to them down below let me show you how
they came
how cool is that when I'm on holiday I
might just bring that box with me and
kind of lift up and care and just run in
slow mode the environments so excited to
be working with relish upgrades on their
sails literally are some of the best
styling products and literally a product
to perfect any hair look or like any
look that you wanted to achieve they are
a brand that don't test their products
on animals which i think is amazing so
who is just an excited me to go and see
Baywatch the movie Zac Efron topless
running down the beach
hello May 29th I'll see you there but if
you're loving the look of these three
hairstyles and trying to go and see
Baywatch smooth even definitely make
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already so it's
out further ado if you like to see how
and what I use it to create three
beaches summer inspired DIY hammocks
then please keep watching
so let's start with the easiest style
the classic beachy waves so I'm going to
be starting off by sectioning off my
hair and using a large sized curling
iron with smaller sized sections of hair
than I usually would
and I'm alternating the direction I curl
them each time as this is going to add
like more volume and dimension to our
hair and I'm literally going to repeat
this process taking small sections
having one outward and one inward and
once I'm done with each layer I'm going
to be at tying it back so it's out of
the way like I said once I'm done with
each layer I'm going to be tying it back
so it's out of the way and then I can
really see what kind of bits I need to
curl next and I do about three or four
layers in total so we've got plenty of
curls to play with so just brushing it
through each layer and just preparing it
to curl I always like to make sure that
the curl closer to my face is going away
from my face because I said I've got
kind of a round face and I don't want to
emphasise that so this way everything is
kind of going away from my face so if
you're like me and have a round face it
definitely a try that trick out we have
just repeating the process of curling in
and out on each layer to get the desired
curls and you can see I'm taking really
small bits for the curls are quite tight
because we are going to be brushing it
them out then we can take all of the
layers down and run our fingers through
it and give it a little bit of as usual
we can move on it to styling I'm just
going to be brushing out via curls
likely to give them a bit of a looser
effect before applying the product so
the product we are using for this look
is a deal Wella shockwaves of volume
mousse as the name suggests it's going
to add a volume it also protects your
hair from the heat and can be used on
its damp hair as well if you want to
blow-dry your hair and get that instant
of volume I'm just going to be taking a
a little sized amount and rubbing it
into my hand now applying this on a dry
hair because I want to have
was like a crunchy BG of volumous vibe
I'm going to be writing this all through
my roots and really is scrunching up the
curls to get that beachy hair effect
like so so the second look is this super
cute boho braid and getting really a
festival of vibes from there so I'm
going to be changing up the parting I'm
going to be creating like a big side
parting and then I'm gonna be section
off to fringy bits one big and then the
feminine side but a lot smaller and then
bringing the rest of my hair around on
at the side of the big side of the
fringe time that fringe abit out the way
so it doesn't get in the way and then we
can go ahead and cut our hair so taking
it three evenly sized a medium sized
chunks of hair is it going down and a
braiding after that and then tying it up
at the end before we can apply some
product but I do it like to pull the
plat out slightly so it doesn't feel it
so it's height for the product I'm going
to be using the ultra strong power hold
hairspray this is going to give our
curls a long and lasting hold and also
it has an honest sticky finish which I
can really appreciate and it's super
easy to brush out so I'm going to be
creating a a big curl on the fringe by
literally wrapping it all the way around
the wand and you can see there it kind
of just creates a lot more of a
sophisticated look and again it's just
tightening up the curl on the other side
as well just because it dropped a little
bit and I kind of wanted to have a bit
more lift
speaking of lift I'm going to be a back
combing the root of the big fringe so
it's upright and then we're going to be
as spraying that strong hairspray at the
root and all over so everything is held
and locked in place and it's going to
last all day so this is the finish
hairstyle and definitely getting like
effortless a beachy of vibes with this I
think it's so pretty
on it to the final hairstyle is the
super fun at space funds so I'm going to
be a section off the front bits of my
hair and taking quite a large section of
the front and just combing it back and
tying it up into a ponytail you are
going to need kind of for hair ties for
this and again I'm going to be repeating
it the process on the other side just
taking a large front chunk of my hair
and tying it back
like so then I'm going to be a
backcombing at seeds kind of ponytail
fits to give our buns a bit of volume
and I'm just going to be spraying them
with hairspray just to make sure that
that fat comb it stays in place and has
a bit of stick to it then I'm going to
be roughing it around my finger twirling
it around and then it's huiying it up
filling out at the root and at the bun
that so you get a bit more of a of
volumous and messy upset because I kind
of want to do some looks fun hence why
using colored hair ties as well I just
want to see a of fun and look put these
baby hair that can't be staying in there
I wanted them to look slicked back so
I'm taking the ultra strong tough cut
tough stuff gel and this is going to
really hold everything in place and keep
it slick and stuck down but it doesn't
have a greasy finish to it which I
really like so I'm just taking a
pea-sized amount and using that to press
down all of my little baby hairs and
flyaways if you suffer from that problem
like me especially in at the heat then
this is going to be the hero product for
you so this is da finished hair look I
think it's so fun and easy to do to
summer and especially on the beaches tie
back your hair I think this is the
perfect fun alternative so those were
the three kind of obviously is some are
beachy first of all whatever you want to
