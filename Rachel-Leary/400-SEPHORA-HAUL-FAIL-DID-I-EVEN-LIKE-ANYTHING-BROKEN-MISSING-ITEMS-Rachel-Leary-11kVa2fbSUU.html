today we are doing a big support hold as
you can tell obviously by my voice and
if you follow me or whatever I'm from
the UK so it's always been a little bit
of a taboo like ordering up from Sephora
so I thought I would show you everything
that I got and just kind of initially
tell you the pricing of the shipping the
taxes basically just whether or not I
thought it was worth it cuz I did spend
around like over $400 on stuff so yeah
some of the stuff actually came broken
some stuff wasn't like the picture that
I thought I was gonna spill the tea a
little bit on Sephora delivery but other
than that I got a bunch of stuff I'm so
excited to try it and hopefully this
gives you guys inspiration if you guys
are going to the US or anywhere that has
a Sephora sometime soon or just on
products that you didn't know whether or
not you wanted to buy hopefully this
helps you if you're excited for this
video in a whole pls already give it a
thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't
already but let's just jump into the
whole I feel like I haven't done a haul
in ages but like I said I am gonna first
of all just talk to you about the
shipping how long it took the pricing
etc so I placed my order on October the
10th it was on express shipping on
October the 11th and the shipping and
handling only cost six pounds which is
like a really good did I look on my
diary the 10th was a Tuesday and I
remember I definitely I think had it by
Friday or was it Saturday one or the
other I basically had it by the end of
the week so it's only like four or five
days that it took to come which is
incredible I was so shocked that how
quickly came cuz like I get a lot of DHL
parcels and that's who that it came with
and I got like an email being like your
DN child parcel is coming today and I
was thinking one day this is from I cuz
I yeah like I said I get like a lot and
I wasn't expecting it to be my Sephora
one and it for it to come so quickly so
I was so so happy with how quickly that
came so if you want like makeup from
Sephora and but you don't think you're
gonna get it's like weeks on make some
weeks don't worry it comes quickly so
massive thumbs up for that however the
taxes and duties if I look at my bear 87
pounds 59 just for the tax
and like yeah when I saw that I was like
oh my god really like I'm spending like
three hundred and something dollars on
like my basket and then you can
basically check on like another make-ups
basket worth of staff just the taxes and
juji's i assume it's just because it's
makeup its liquids it's a little bit
like when you're like importing that in
from another country but that i think is
the biggest like why people don't want
to order from their view from the u.k so
on that no and then after looking at the
products I got and I'm actually ther I'm
thinking the taxes and duties go up the
more stuff that you buy but in my head
I'm thinking if I'm gonna be ordered
from Sephora I'm gonna just order a lot
because you don't do it often it's like
a regular thing but maybe if you are
ordering just like a small amount of
stuff your taxes wouldn't be that high I
think it's just cuz it's like a heavy
box that it's like that so I think
that's why it was so high but then after
kind of opening the box and obviously I
wanted to have a look at the stuff
inside it cuz I was a kid in a candy
shop and I just learned to see two of my
items came smashed and two eyeshadow
palettes that I ordered one what I saw
oh my god I just realized there's
something missing
I want my god wait I'm gonna have to
look in that box going to see that
actually is missing but we'll see we'll
see we'll see I just don't remember
seeing it in there okay anyways yes so
do my items came smashed which I'll go
through in a minute but yeah so do I
think it was worth after getting all my
products it was kind of worth it because
I got some of brands that we don't get
here in the UK but I don't know like I
was a I like I'm stoked cuz a lot the
stuff I ordered was Sephora collection
stuff which don't see a brand that you
can't get anywhere other than there and
yeah I'm a little bit disappointed
because it wasn't as what the pictures
kind of showed me but maybe that sounds
like my own fault I had my hopes too
high but then we'll see but yes anyway
with that done it does give me a little
insight into the shipping and the timing
and the pricing and all that kind of
good stuff
so now let's get on with the whole okay
so first of all
like I said I ordered a lot of staff
it's kind of off-the-books now but I've
got a lot of it in front of me and a lot
of it was at the Sephora collection
products because like I said you can't
office to get Sephora collection stuff
anywhere other than Sephora and I've
heard really good stuff about it like
every time I've been to the u.s. life
the quality of it is really really
really good so I definitely wanted to
get my hands on a few bits so the first
thing I picked up is the Sephora gel gel
mask hydrating and quenching now
anything that is hydrating in quenching
you guys know I'm obsessed with if I
just so it's essentially like that wet
cream gel feeling and I think it's just
like a little mask yeah use one or two
times a week and leave on for five to
ten minutes
anything you guys know that's like a
really wet moisturizer or really wet
mask I'm obsessed with cuz I have kind
of like dehydrated to dry a skin so I'm
so excited to use that and it smells
really like spa II I know I should have
probably checked the milliliters I was
ordering but I thought it was a lot
bigger so I was a little bit like oh
it's like I didn't obviously check what
it was and all the Sephora collection
stuff it's actually quite reasonably
priced so yeah I'm excited to use this
I'll let you know how I get on but if
you're in the market for maybe some kind
of slightly cheaper skin care that's of
a good quality I think this is a good
shout I actually smells really really
good like really a spa okay so here's
the next product I ordered three of the
same and is the Sephora golden hours of
powders now these are all kind of meant
to be at different shades of like
illuminating face powders more of a
summer more bronzy tones blush tones you
guys know I love like products on the
face that make me glow like shimmery
bronzers again like highlighters and
blushes all of that kind of like texture
so I'm so excited to get these else like
yes like there's like a bronze one a
blush one an highlight one I'm gonna get
all three so three colors like got with
dusk dawn and high noon dawn is this one
here as you can see it's literally the
most gorgeous illuminating gold color
said this one's kind of more like your
classic highlighted that you'd put on
your cheeks the pur formula of these is
so a battery and so smooth I was so
excited to try them
yes the shimmery bronzer the shimmering
blusher said the blusher shade is in the
shade 0-1 dust and the bronzer shade is
in the shade high noon
how the hell but one survived and these
two really really did not you guys see
literally completely smashed I'm so
upset they let you like so smashed to
smithereens that I can't even try and
use them without obviously it would they
would place so much product onto my face
it's literally gonna have you out all
over my desk but the good thing is I did
DM Sephora and I was like till my items
came smashed like can you help me and
they have offered me a complete refund
which is good but now I'm just the
ensign because I've got I wrote down the
list of all the products I've got and
I've realized ones not even in here I
ordered the Sephora outrageous effect
volume lip gloss in to XXL lives that's
not in that so and now I'm on the
website and I'm looking at it and it's
out of stock so it's one of those things
where it's like if it's out of stock
don't tell me that it's in stock and
like not tell me that I can't get it
because like you've charged me for it
you've charged me for two broken items
and one that's not even there so answer
me that's the pleura moving on this is
what I was so excited for so I've got my
hands on the Sephora pro warm palette
but in the intro you would have had me
say about the two eyeshadow palettes I
ordered I'm really kind of disappointed
it's like not as warm as I thought and
like five of the shades look exactly the
same
so there was so much hype about this cuz
it looks like a really cool a complete
mixture of shades of like loads of warm
tones perfect for autumn and when I got
it I was thinking yes yes yes opened up
I am quite disappointed like you tell me
hold on is that what you thought it was
gonna be I don't know like I thought
these were a lot more like orange e red
like that one that like one two three
four colors they look exactly the same
and like the shimmers like one two three
they all look exactly the same
I don't know just on the website they
just looked a lot more difference I
thought I'm getting like a brand new
it's my favorite new warmed shade
palette but I have to say the pigment is
crazy good and it's like the support
it's obviously Sephora own it's
obviously Sephora own so it's like
normally one of those like high-end
brands I don't even think I paid two too
much for this it was okay translates it
into GBP this was like about 50 pounds
so yeah it's slightly disappointed
because I thought it was a bit more
diverse but the pigment is great so if
you want me to do looks with this let me
know not the palette of dreams that I
thought it was gonna be it but the
pigment is still great nonetheless okay
this eyeshadow palette I was really
excited for as well it says it has an
150 weight 145 dollar value but I'm
guessing I obviously didn't pay that
much this is what it looks like really
really pretty on the website I actually
thought it was gonna be a lot bigger
than it was
so I'm actually kind of happy that it's
smaller because big palettes of such a
paint like but in your drawers all that
kind of stuff now just have the picture
of it on the back and it's a bit small
basically I thought this was gonna be a
lot warmer tone then it is and I thought
the shadows were gonna be a lot bigger
if I give you like reference to like I
don't know what would you know the size
of like an eyeshadow pikmin the
eyeshadows are pretty small and really
like not warm toned at all if you click
the link down below to see what this
palette is like advertised as on the
website can you see I thought it was
gonna be like I don't know I thought I
thought 22 was a matte and I thought it
was a lot warmer but let's swatch
again the pic I'm sure you can see again
the pigment is really really great even
I just watched a shimmer shade and that
one came off really really nicely but I
if I could have seen this in person I
probably wouldn't have got it if that
makes sense because it's not a palette
that I'm instantly gonna go to but the
shimmers are really really pretty
again if this is kind of more of a
putter up your street let me know if you
want to see
with it yeah you do get loads and loads
of eyeshadows in this really good for
traveling what something there in that
yeah big mirror in that and actually
there's like looks that you can do like
demonstrated in it a little disappointed
I feel like I should name this like a
Sephora haul fail some of its just not
great not great this I'm excited to try
this is from a this before collection as
well as part of their like skincare type
thing it is a moisturizing shower oil
I'm all about like body oils making
myself feel super silky and smooth and
stuff so I thought this would be it
really like good to get for the shower
smells a little like grasper but
essentially it says this is the most
surprising of the shower oils this
authentic shower oil gently cleanses the
skin instantly moisturizing it perfectly
clean that the skin is supple super soft
and it feels great so it's a fragrant
oil texture and it becomes milky in
contact with water so you apply onto
damp skin then massage it in it will
transform into a milk that rinses off
easily with water so I'm excited to try
this
I'd like I said I love anything that's
like shower oil I'm sure you can get
shower oils here in the UK but I thought
I would try this one since I'm adding
things into my basket I'll let you know
how I got on with this and if I feel
like super baby but smooth after I use
it but yeah I'll probably use this in
conjunction with a normal shower gel
because this says it cleanses not
necessarily like clean so I probably
want to clean myself with like an actual
antibacterial shower gel to start with
and then go in with DES afterwards so
I'm excited to try this and smell like a
field and finally I am a big fan of sort
of Sephora brushes I got the number
forty one brush which looks like this I
think I've got this for like a
foundation or cream products it's just a
big really firm being I say big again
big stiffening a brush but yeah I've got
it for like cream products I'm a massive
fan of Sephora brushes I always make
sure to pick one up every time I go or
every time I do an order this one says
that it is a domed stippling brush so
again gonna be amazing
for cream products whether it be
foundation I might actually use this as
my primer apply the curse you like now
I'm a ride-or-die for my real techniques
and multitask brush but it's kind of
like had its day so maybe this one feels
that I'm not sure but that's kind of
what I'd be using it for is like cream
products because duo fiber brushes are
really good at blending them in so yes
I'm excited to try that one but that is
everything that I got from the Sephora
collection at side of things so now we
can move on to other products so I
picked up an old favorite which I
obviously haven't tried before is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz in a
medium brown this is like my perfect
shade and I haven't been using like
other dupes of it like the NYX micro
brow pencil Maybelline did a micro brow
pencil as well benefit precisely my brow
pencil they're all really really similar
so I hadn't actually used this one in
ages and then I gave it a little bit
like a swatch the other day on my hand
and I was like you know what this is
ryuk Anastasia is like obviously the og
of brows just applies it so nicely
obviously when you get into brand new
brow pencil you get like the most
precision that you can get out of it I
love this color it's perfectly kind of
like a mix of warm and cool tones I
think that's what they advertise on the
website that this was quite good for
people with cool tone brown hair and I
do have like ashy bits running through
my hair as you guys know so this is kind
of like the perfect balance it's not too
dark it's not too light formula this
just applies amazingly we still have
never tried an Anastasia Beverly Hills
brow product this is like a really good
at first like beginners brow pencil now
these are two items and brand I was so
excited to try these are both from Pat
McGrath and I don't think you can get
these anywhere in the UK so I picked up
a ultra glide eye pencil in the color
brown the lips I think it comes with
like a little sharpener which is always
handy sup at that in there but yeah so
this is the Pat McGrath solarz perma gel
ultra glide eye pencil in blitz Brown so
I'll give you a little swatch huh oh my
god sorry
creamy sorry
creamy but that is the color of that I'm
not sure if you're gonna be able to like
pick up on it but essentially this was
advertised as like a brown with a little
bit of like a gold glycerin through it
but a really gorgeous warm brown those
the kind of colors I love to wear on my
waterline so I definitely wanted to pick
this up plus I hear like the best things
about Pat McGrath makeup like she's just
the queen so yeah I definitely wanted to
pick up a few items from her and this
was one of the ones I think it was new
and like at the top of my list and the
other thing I picked up was a palma gel
ultra lip pencil again it comes with
another sharpener and this one is in the
color contour which is like the most
gorgeous if you want to make your lips
look bigger this is the perfect nude new
as you can see it looks like that these
are like my favorite colors to use
because again it gives you the most kind
of natural kind of shading if you want
your lips lip bigger as you guys know I
always ever like my lips so those kind
of colors are perfect cuz they're not
too warm they're just kind of like that
shadow color and give the most natural
look and they go with my every color
nude so I was so excited to pick that up
and the color definitely just the look
didn't disappoint and even to the
formula literally it's so creamy glide
on amazingly finally a product I
actually loved in my haul oh so I was
actually pretty excited to get my hands
on these two as well these are both from
tart I got the Attar 'test paint which I
actually have loads up I think they came
up with like new colors or just like
updated colors and this one's in the
color pillow-talk is that not like me
and a nude color it was described just
like a white nude which is like what I
love let me like the top if you never
try to talk that paint that formula is
that really like buildable and they dry
it super super quick so I'm obsessed
like that is like my kind of nude a
hundred percent I had been using the
target artists lip paint in a salty way
if I could
come tap some so this is the one that I
have been like going to as you can see
this one is salty it's just slightly
more like womb toned a little bit darker
so there is like a difference so I was
so excited to get that because tops and
I'm kind of hard to get hold of in the
UK so I was obviously gonna pick up a
few bits from there and this bit and
this as well as so me I've been dying to
get this to look at the packaging for
one it's so extra
so glitz it is the hottest lip bling top
coat which lips you were screaming at my
name I think I saw this one amy snapshot
like ages ago so it's been out for ages
but I just hadn't been able to get my
hands on it
it's literally yeah like a clear topcoat
just adds a little bit of glitter a
little bit of bling a little bit of dsl
realness on your face but yeah sorry I
just I almost just got it for like the
packaging being completely honest it's
absolutely gorgeous I can't wait to wear
this so again this was another one that
I am like happy that I got so this is
something that I was super excited to
try is the rubber hydration make rubber
mask hydration lover from a doctor jaw
I've heard such good things about that
brand and so it says after cleansing
massage step one on to the skin to
nourish open step two which I assume is
this carefully remove the film and place
the mask onto your face and gently press
okay so you applied this all over your
skin I'm gonna press this on the top and
you leave it for 30 to 40 minutes so I'm
assuming that gives your skin like it
smells like forced to absorb this
hydration so I am so excited to try this
anything that was like a rubber mask was
really interesting to me let me know if
you want to see like a cool Instagram
video on this I didn't think of doing
that but like if I'm gonna look
something like this guy then maybe I
should do it but anything like I said
bill the skin care anything that's gonna
be hydrating and make my skin feel super
soft I am down for so I'm excited to try
this and I thought amazing things about
this skincare brand in general so
another kind of like con moisturizing
skincare thing I've got is this fizzy
body
sculpting and Musa from the brand too
cool for school and I think you can get
them on cult beauty because I got that
coconut milky it's spray from now which
I love so I saw the brand on here now am
I going to know what I'm gonna get
something from there again and like it's
a it's a fizzy body sculpting mousse
listen to it ready I'm not even sure
what like fizzy popping whatever
essentially it is like it says the
sparkling air bubble spray containing
make tea extract and skin turning patent
ingredients slim light provides
intensive hydrating a care for the
appearance of healthy and toned skin
specialized skin care provides the
powerful cooling effect which instantly
reduces the look of cellulite reduces
puffiness and improves the skin and
firmness while offering a freshman
soothing care for the skin basically can
use this all over your body I know these
things are a little bit if I could they
don't really work kind of thing but I've
never heard of like a fizzy body
sculpting mousse I've only ever heard of
like the moisturizers that meant to be
like tightening or anything so I'm
excited to give this a go and I'll keep
you guys updated if it actually works
and finally I didn't actually order
these they were sent to me but you can
get them from Sephora now so I thought I
might as well just include it in the
whole it's the new huda beauty kind of
foundation and primer and stuff so this
is the huda beauty complexion pre a
makeup base so essentially the primer to
go with that foundation it just comes in
like a little pump like this I have
actually got the foundation and the
primer on today excuse me do you let me
know if you want me to do like a full
review on it and like a proper proper
first impressions because and knowing me
I just kind of put it on so so excited
but like I am gonna have to take this
makeup off because I've got my thing
later and a little bit so it's not like
a real first impression so let me know
need actually like to see overview on
there but yeah and it's like so far it
applied and whatever really really good
so super excited to keep trying this and
wearing it it literally is like a full
coverage dream yes as well so including
that I've got two shades of the
foundation I got the shade latte and the
shade pray polish
I don't know that's French or not but
it's 310 and 320 G now as I'm on the
Hoonah Beauty PR they do actually ask
you like what two colors do you think
that you might be and if and I love it
when brands do that because then I'm
like obviously guaranteed to wear it
because I have picked the shades that I
think that I am they've done that so
many swatches online and stuff and what
I like to do is if I get to or if I
think the shade rate and just like I'm
not gonna get one that's exactly my
color I always like to get a neutral
shade and a golden shade and some
together because that for me makes like
my perfect color I definitely like to
think I'm a lot more warm toned then I
actually am as in like the golden yellow
change kind of thing I'm definitely not
I'm definitely like a pale girl at heart
that has like red and like paint
undertones but no one needs to know
there but I'll swatch them both for you
like the tiniest of pumps so this one oh
my god you can see how like thick that
is so this one was the last a shade and
that one was the paler shade shade so
the slightly more golden one side it
more neutral one as you can see oh my
god I need to like wipe my hands cuz
this will go everywhere from applying it
I could tell les was definitely more
they've said this as well literally you
barely need any of that product to get
still achieve a full coverage look and
the formula and the consistency of it is
definitely definitely of the full
coverage like spectrum there's no doubt
about it so if you're in the market for
a new full coverage foundation
definitely give this one a go do your
research from the shades before unlike
the Fendi one I don't think this really
oxidizes much the color just literally
it stays the same yeah I'm liking it so
far but I've had it on for about an hour
yeah so that's not a true test cuz all
I've been doing is sat here in front of
the lights but it's called the fo filter
finished foundation and I'm feeling like
you can't even see any imperfections on
my face so that's pretty cool
so that was the end of my Sephora I
really hope you guys enjoyed it it was a
bit of a Sephora haul fail considering
some of the items were my I thought one
didn't come to broke so I'll leave your
opinions up to you let me know in the
