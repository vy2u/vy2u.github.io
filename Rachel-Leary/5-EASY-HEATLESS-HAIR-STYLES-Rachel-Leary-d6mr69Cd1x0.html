so today I am obviously you can tell by
the title I say that's every time I'm
doing five easy heatless hairstyles
they're super quick super easy to do you
guys really liked the last hair tutorial
that I did so I thought I would kind of
keep up the trend and throw another hair
tutorial in there for you guys I think
of perfect like school or just anytime
that you need kind of like a quick
hairstyle I want to just look put
together make sure to give this video a
thumbs up for more kind of hair
tutorials or make sure to leave
suggestions in the comments down below
also make sure to subscribe if you
haven't already and let's get started so
just time off with my normal hair I'm
just gonna brush through it and make
sure to get rid of any knots so we have
obviously a fresh set of hair before we
start styling it the first look is kind
of like an ariana grande inspired almost
that half-up half-down look so I'm just
taking kind of the topmost part of my
hair and using a comb it makes it easier
to kind of brush back as much as you
want and then it's just tying it up with
a hair tie and then tightening it and
adjusting it to however you want it to
look
super easy super kind of minimal and I
think it looks so good it's especially
when you've got those greasy hair days
as a go-to hairstyle the second look we
are going for you're gonna need
hairspray a brush a few Clips and hair
ties so first of all I am just kind of
doing the same motion as we did before
picking up kind of the top part of my
hair and then in that top part I'm
separating that into two parts that make
sense you can kind of see what I'm doing
as I'm doing it and then the bottom part
of the top part I am just gonna brush
and a back comb because we're going to
be creating that kind of quiff style
look and back combing it makes sure to
give it a lot of volume and obviously a
lot of lift so I'm just going to pin
that back and then it repeat the same
motion with the top part of the top part
if that makes sense again so just
brushing it forward and then a back
combing I like to separate it into two
parts just because I think that's how
you can get the most volume and the most
lift from this look like I said just
back combing it back and then it's just
kind of spreading it apart over the kind
of one that we just already did and then
again pinning that back as well
just applying some hairspray to look it
all in place and you could just leave
that there but I wanted to tie it up
into a ponytail to kind of give more of
a different look
so yeah just picking up the excess hair
and using a hair tie to tie it all
together so that is the second hairstyle
again really easy and no heat and I
think this would look really cool if you
pet it was like some hoops or something
onto the third look this one I got so
many requests on how I do it on my
Instagram first of all I'm gonna take
two little fringy bits to start with and
then the rest of the hair I'm just gonna
brush back and tie it into a messy bun
hence saying messy so you can literally
obviously be as messy as you want I just
brush it all back and then kind of twirl
it around my finger while it round and
tie it with a hair tie and then I just
pull out any bits of hair that I need to
then obviously when I did it on my
Instagram I did use a curling Tong but I
found this to be a really quick and easy
way to get a curl I twist it around my
finger and then twist it in into a
circle and then pin it and then again
obviously do the same with the other one
as well so kind of creating like two
flat bun shapes on the top of my head
this is going to kind of tell your hair
that it's gonna be curly if that makes
sense and what I like to do is once I've
obviously curls it all like so I then
pin it back and then I just leave it for
a while so obviously depending on how
much time you've got they're kind of
stronger the curl is going to be and I
also find it helps to spray them with
hairspray as well this kind of helps to
look in that shape
then like I said just leave it for a
while and then just take out the pins to
kind of release the curl this is
honestly one of my favorite hairstyles
to do it's so easy and it's super chic
and like I said I love it onto the
fourth one you're just gonna need four
hair ties it's kind of the same process
as we did it with the two front Brits of
Fringe basically just tying up your hair
into four buns I always like to separate
the front two just because I feel that
they curl differently and they need
slightly more of like a tighter curl or
like a tighter bun
so yeah just tying them up instead of
four buns obviously you could leave a
hurt the two like this because if you
like that kind of hair but after doing
that just creating it to a bigger buns
at the back as well and this like I said
before is just gonna curl your hair so
obviously you could sleep in it I always
find sleeping in buns creates the best
curls but obviously if you don't have
time just leave them for a while and it
spray them up with hairspray it just to
it create that beachy it loose curl
so there is the fourth look just kind of
loose beachy curls without any heat and
the final look I think is probably one
of the easiest ones but kind of looks
the most put together and pretty just
taking the front to bits of your hair
again and then just braiding them back
braids are such a kind of big trend at
the moment I've just done a regular plat
but of so you could French plat or
fishtail plat or whatever clap you can
do even if you can't plat if you just
take two bits of hair and kind of weave
them in and out of each other and pin
them back and hairspray them I think
that looks super pretty as well but like
I said I'm just doing a regular braid
and pinning them back and that is the
final look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to give it
a thumbs up if you did and I will see
you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
