so here are my five top tips on how to
get those big-ass juicy poppin lips
you've always wanted give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't
already now let's get started
first of all with nothing on the lips
you're going to exfoliate this gets
blood pumping into the lips and makes
them appear fuller and also gets rid of
any dead skin so lipstick applies
smoother now to over line I'm taking two
colors going in with a slightly lighter
color of the two this is addiction from
Rimmel I'm just using this to over line
the my lips and fill them in slightly
where you want to concentrate over
lining is on your Cupid's bow and kind
of just past it you want to stick
towards your natural lip line when
you're going towards the edge of your
mouth because if you over line all the
way down that's when it starts to look
really unnatural and it's really obvious
that you've drawn your lips on and then
again same at the bottom keeping to your
natural lip line on the edge of your
mouth and then concentrating over lining
along the bottom and a tiny bit further
up but yet mainly concentrating it along
the bottom then like I said I'm just
feathering this product in slightly so
if any of the lip products were to come
off you're not left with a super harsh
line so it saves you in the future then
it going in with a slightly dark one and
it's sharpening it this is matte spice
still a similar undertone but just a
slightly darker shade we're just using
this to kind of emphasize the areas that
we read over line to add dimension and
let we want to make them appear fuller
step three time to fill in the lips I
think a liquid lipstick is the perfect
thing to fill in your lips especially
when you're over lining because they
apply it like a gloss so you can really
blend it in with the liner that you've
drawn and get really precise and really
up close and then what's best is that
they dry matte so they last a really
really long time the lip so hopefully
where you've over lined is going to stay
at for as long as possible then an extra
tip you can either take a lighter
lipstick this is fleshpot from mac or
even your concealer just concentrating
that in the center of your lip and
dabbing it out with your finger gives
the illusion of fuller lips as like when
you highlight in contour the things that
you lighten you bring forward and it
thinks a darker sink back so the your
the center of your lip appears a lot
more plump and more cushion like which
is what we want now time to highlight in
contour I swear then you can never
escape this trend will ever feature
you're focusing on we're going to
contour underneath the lip using a
fluffy brush and I'm going in with my
benefit hoola bronzer this just makes
the bottom lip appear more cushioned and
more forward and then highlighting your
Cupid's bow just makes your top lip
appear more forward as well the light on
the top brings it forward and I am just
using mary-lou manizer by the balm and
just placing that using my finger on my
Cupid's bow and blending it out
finally applying a gloss this one is the
duo clip venom in pink shimmer which is
actually a lip plumping gloss if you
have one of those amazing that's gonna
obviously help plump up your lips anyway
but just applying a gloss makes your
lips appear more 3d and more full anyway
when the light hits them they'll look
super juicy so that is the end of the
video and that is my before and after
these are just tips that I find to look
the most natural so if you guys enjoyed
this video give it a thumbs up and I
will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
