today I am doing a it's mainly an eye
makeup tutorial but I do include kind of
the finishing skin products and the lip
the yeah I am doing a makeup tutorial
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette it is literally me
in a palette when you guys saw that I
got hold of this so so so many of you
requested a tutorial so you could do so
many look to this I try to do something
a bit different then I would naturally
want to do which is probably like a
winged smokey eye on a nude lip or
something but yeah so I decided to kind
of go with more of the pink colors in
this palette and do something a little
bit different from each but I didn't
show you inside the palette but yeah if
you like the look of this makeup look
make sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already and
let's get started
so I've already done my base and my
eyebrows all products will be linked
down below as normal going straight onto
the eyes I am using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills modern venison's palette
is gorgeous his a close-up as you can
see is everything I'm obsessed with warm
color wise and I'm going in with the
color raw sienna on the brush that it
came with I actually really love the
brushes that come with the anastasia
beverly hills palettes but this look
today is going to be rounded hence why I
did my base first and I'm just buffing
that into the crease as the initial
transition color then I'm going in with
burnt orange which is just a slightly
warmer deeper Brown just using that to
further deepen up the socket and I'm
using a Mac two one seven to do this
using the same windscreen wiper motions
backwards and forth and keeping it
rounded leoch I said just using that
color to deepen up the crease and then
going in with red ochre the same type of
motion but just concentrating this
mainly on the outer kind of quarter of
the eye you guys know the drill just to
really create a smokey gradient effect
then going back in with the original
fluffy brush that we use just to blend
everything out for the lid color I'm
mixing these two shimmery shades
together and just pressing that onto the
lid using a flat brush I am obsessed
with the pigmentation of this palette it
is the best quality ever I'm not even
kidding the shimmery shades sometimes
they don't have a really strong color
payoff but this one did and then I'm
going in with I think this was am I
going to can't remember the name but I
have linked it below and it's a really
nice pink color because I did want to
incorporate mainly pinks in this
tutorial and this one had a bit of
shimmer to it so I'm just using this to
transition between the light shimmery
color and then the red ochre or yeah the
red ochre crease color and yeah it just
creates a nice transition on the lid
then going back in with a fluffy brush
like always and just making sure
everything is blended out seamlessly
then I'm just going back in with the
fluffy brush again and just kind of
perfecting everything almost just making
sure the pigmentation is how I want it
to look and yeah just making sure it's
exactly how I want it to be then going
in with love-letter on the lower lash
line just on a pencil brush and really
it's smoking and buffing out I decided
to go for a kind of bright colorful
waterline or lower lash line just as
something a bit different and to add a
pop of color for the summertime because
this is such a summertime palette then
going in with the lightest shimmery
palest color I'm using that to highlight
my inner corner and my brow bone this is
going to really help open up our eyes
and also it lifts our brow bone as well
then using this NYX lip liner in bloom
it's also called hot pink as well using
that in the waterline I'm not sure how
safe that is so if you have a pink
eyeliner I'd use that then it using my
favorite rounded lashes these are the
lure flash it lashes from their new
naked collection and I do have a
discount code below for money off so
make sure you check that out then going
back to the skin I'm using Mac
mineralize skinfinish in give me son on
a duo fiber brush I'm obsessed with
using a duo fiber brush at the moment
just with bronzes and for contouring and
stuff just because it doesn't allow you
to apply it too much product and it
really it blends everything out
then using the contour pan from makeup
geek in bad habit on my real techniques
I think this is the contour brush just
using that in the hollows of my cheek
bones as you can see the difference
gives a lot more definition I really
like this one I think it might be one of
the lightest ones that they do because
it's so subtle and it doesn't look muddy
at all I'm obsessed using that on my
nose as well just for a soft contour and
then I'm using this new blusher from
Becca in Tiger Lily oh my god these
luminous blushes are to die for they
give the most gorgeous glow to the skin
this one has a bit more of a peachy
pinky orange undertone so it really
brings out the color in my eyes and I
love it and then this sticking with the
pink theme is that peach glow
highlighter from laura geller again it's
a new product I was doing like a
snapchat unboxing so if you follow me on
snapchat you'd have seen and oh my god
it is beautiful it's a really really
soft pink it's not really intensely pink
or peach but it's a bit softer than
normal and I'm just dusting that
basically all over my skin but since I
was using the new Anastasia palette I
decided to use the new at glow kit as
well and mixing the two lightest colors
and just tapping that on top of the
Laura Geller highlighter just to really
intensify it
then for the lip I'm using right
favorite bright color from Anastasia
Beverly Hills this is Rio just to tie in
with the bright pink lower lash line and
kind of complete the summer look I'm
obsessed this color for summer and that
is the finished look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you did and leave
it future requests in the comments down
below I'm going on holiday soon so I'd
really appreciate some suggestions but
yeah like I said I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see you
in the next one bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
