you see that
like it just clever comes off I think
put it on and it just came off wherever
how's the shimmer I apply really weirdly
it's just weird tonight welcome back to
my channel so today we're going to be
reviewing the controversial
subculture palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills that they've recently come
out with there has been so much kind of
like hype about this palette but not
necessarily in the best way I'm sure you
all know what I'm talking about so if
you want to see how I kind of create
this look with this palette
however on in my general thoughts on it
then make sure to give this video thumbs
up subscribe if you haven't already and
please keep watching ok so I've already
completed on my skin because this is
going to be of C an eye makeup palette
feature focus if I make sense if you
want the details of what's on the rest
of my face I'm sure I will have picked
an Instagram by now so I've left a link
to that down below so let's talk about
the palette itself when I first of all
saw it on social media I actually wasn't
a massive fan what the colors I thought
looked like that make sense I kind of
don't make sense Cape I mean says it's
kind of sort of pilot outside I wasn't a
fan of the colors they didn't scream to
me because I'm such as a wall turned
palette lover to the modern renaissance
palette was like my dream palette so I
didn't instantly look at it and think
this is going to be at my new favorite
but when you actually open it up I
really like the colors though they are
actually a lot warmer then I sorted that
for thinking okay like I actually really
like this palette and I can't wait to
give it a go and then I started seeing
everyone switching it and from what I
can see it's super super powdery but
then everyone was saying that they saw
that maybe there was adult bat or
whatever so I waited till now to see in
mind is part of that like crap batch
reminds actually okay but what I will
say is there is absolutely no denying
the pigmentation of these products like
the pigmentation of these shadows like
let me do a swatch like that's
ridiculous especially for like a matte
shade if I do it this shimmery shade as
well you can see that that's like insane
a pigmentation there is no denying the
people
our show is incredible all anastasia
beverly hills i shadows are if you've
had some of their talents before or
they're single shadows you'd know like
just pigmentation them is amazing so i'm
going to zoom you in to the palette now
and i'm just going to take the brush
that it comes with and just initially
just get my brush in like that was just
like a few times and you can see the
amount of powder that's been produced so
i thought this is what a lot of people
were complaining about in the sense of
the fat day was so powdery it's so
pigmented so why isn't it like blending
well I thought that's what everyone's
problem was but I feel like I saw a
little bit of controversy not that long
ago of the fact that this palette got
leaked before anyone from anastasia
beverly hills by novena or anyone could
actually initially talk about it so i'm
feeling maybe they felt like they had to
rush the production of it and get it out
quick so nothing else could be leaked
and then they could have final
confirmation on this brand new product
that was coming out because everyone
hikes for anastasia beverly hills
palettes let's be honest they're like
always the best of the best so i feel
like maybe it was slightly rushed and
the next batch of d they feel like
fingers crossed will be better I'm
saying is my haven't even tried it
myself so we'll see but just from what
I've seen from everyone else everyone's
a little bit let down but they can't win
it got leaked so you want to get this
out to you quicker but then it just it
wasn't up their quality of previous and
in life you just always compare things
so we're always going to compare it to a
modern renaissance or the other ones and
we know that they're absolutely
incredible but not just Claire's like my
initial thoughts and the whole thing I
don't hate the brand now because they've
got one does Pilate you know I mean like
we're gonna try it we're going to test
it I'm going to create a look for you
guys I'm getting like a halo kind of I
inspired maybe one with the color of my
jumper I'm not sure but let's just go
ahead and create a look so because I'm
aware that these eyeshadows are super
super powdery I'm going to go ahead and
take some solution powder and just leave
it underneath my eye in case we get any
fallout that way I can just brush it
away and it's not going to be a problem
okay I'm also now going to go ahead and
pry my eye on just going to use the
concealer I use on my face to do that
which in this case is via knit and fat
concealer in the shade number five I'm
just gonna put it a little bit on my
eyes and just blend
pulp as organ just gonna set my
eyeshadow base in place just with the
same translucent powder I've got
underneath my eyes that way any I shall
I put on the top hopefully should blend
a lot easier okay like so now you can go
ahead and start I kind of want to use as
many colors as possible to just kind of
test the palette to its full potential
so I'm going to go ahead and use the
shade NuWave as my initial transition
color and I'm going to use it a sigma
diffused crease e38 brush it's like a
small dome fluffy brush which actually
has kind of like a hard it's quite
precise it's still super fluffy so I'm
just going to go ahead and put that hold
on onions in a bit closer okay so now I
can totally kind of see why people think
that they're hard to blend because I
just kind of put my brush down and it
did cling straightaway to wherever I
just put it but with a bit of work I
feel that blend it out do you not think
I mean yet I've got a little bit of
fallout here but that's okay right okay
but I will show you that's what my pan
looks like right now so I kind of want
to just try and pick up that product
without taking up any more but they will
produce like a big pile of dust on my
palate so I'm just taking the brush
again and I'm really lightly like
pressing this and now blending
we'll see the color is really nice it's
not as yellow as I thought it's
definitely a lot more orange as you
apply er but like they're blending I am
running in a lot more work than I
usually word I normally wouldn't even
use this kind of brush I would use
something a lot fluffier and a little
bigger okay that's not too bad to start
with I'm now just like I'm scared to try
and blend it in with other I showed but
later we're going to try I'm going to
take the shade Roxy which is like a
peachy brown color this one don't
actually have as much fallout as the
other one so maybe this one's going to
be better but we're going to do a halo I
think today is I'm going to be
concentrating on that outer part and
like the inner part I think that I think
maybe it's just because I'm like patting
it on it's applying a lot like nicer I
think that it's okay right I feel like
the problem isn't almost like too much
pigmentation it's too like yeah too
pigmented there's like too much eye
shadow being picked up at once but I'll
go ahead and apply it on the upside as
well again just contouring it like on
the inner most part just taking it a
little bit across I actually might pick
up a little bit more of that new wave
color like I always do like I always
like to go back and with my initial
crease color girl that has gone all in
my palette if I did like if I tap it off
it's all going to come off my brush but
in just buffing it back room for to make
sure it's all blended out as much as I
can I'm going to go in with this also
color on a slightly it's in a tapered
brush this is a Mac two to one and I'm
just going to dab my brush in there that
one again actually not
as much fallout at that initial new wave
color again just all apply this on the
outer most part the eye and then again
on the inner most part and I'm just
going to go back in with my previous
brush to try and blend that out
you see it's like not really planned
like Clumber I put my brush banishes but
not staying just per bit more in the
darker colors really yeah they're not so
easy to load it stay on my I keep
putting product there stay bitch stay
it's like a need to be really gentle
where they're to like not apply too much
and then apply loads of pressure for it
to like wow I don't know it's Reese
bizarre we'll try again on this side so
again on the outermost part and then
like on our inner most part but what I
will say is in the pan doesn't that look
so much like lighter it looks like a lot
more red little pink and then on my eye
it's like a really really dark purple
and I noticed that when I applied that
orange color to start with it looks
really yellow in the pan and then I put
it on it's actually kind of like a dark
then orange so can you see that like it
just cleared look comes off I think put
it on and it just came off I'll put it
back on then Charlie and go back and
with this brush to trim blend it
together oh my god it's in the third
well I won't down why I yeah if I don't
want to just you've got to get it right
the first time because you actually just
like con blender I'm going to go back in
with that Roxy color and just like tap
it a little bit more
on my eyes service like the transitions
there oh my god this is really difficult
I even like even okay I feel like that's
the best but it's going to get I'm now
going to take the adorne shade which is
the metallic bronze but I am also glaze
this one is like the center Center
highlight as well but you have to start
with I'm going to take that adorned
color and just use a little gingy brush
from that I think this is called they're
two for two and I'm just going to use
this to place it in the center oh my oh
not as much pigmentation as I thought
okay maybe it's the brush I'm using so
I'm just going to go ahead and use my
fingernail okay that's better
considering I normally use that 242
brush with like that spoiled shadows in
the past a little bit upset but really I
do real work and I want that Roxy color
to like be shown they feel like it's not
oh my god it's all just like staying on
top of each other okay and again
somewhere I don't know like suddenly
move and it all like F up but it's taken
so long to get to this point okay but I
do like that now I take my finger again
with that metallic bronze shade oh my
god I just wanted there's like a lot of
going back and forth the desert where
the house does shimmer
do you know i mean i swatched that on my
arm and like there was shimmer there's
just none it just hasn't come on just
not I don't want you to keep rubbing my
fingers and like pressing on my own it's
doing okay what I will do is if now take
that really gorgeous electric color
which is like a reflex green almost it
looks really really pretty bright yellow
green
kind of like a greeny gold running
through it and I'm going to take on a
little two to eight brush format which
is a really small precise shader brush
and just kind of try to press that in
the middle again where is it I don't
like to rub it on my eye this one really
isn't getting a huge amount of Fallout
but it's almost like there was a layer
on the top and now I'm rubbing my brush
in it and it's kind of like compressing
down and not really picking up any
product at all it's all kind of like
solidifying on my brush and it's not
even tough like I'm not picking anything
up but yeah I really do feel like that
the best I'm gonna get and that the cube
shade from that palette is like a white
but it's got like a reflex of pink to it
and I really don't want that to be my
inner corner highlight so I'm going to
take the heart I use my face which is
the Tarte exposed highlighter and just
take that on my pencil brush and just
highlight my inner corner
okay now I've done that I'm going to go
ahead and wipe away the power of Mundy's
my eye and the fallout because as you
can see there is a lot of fallout it's
not like stained in my face or anything
so we good I'm such a perfectionist when
it comes to eyeshadows I'm really like
wanting this to look better I'm now I'm
just going to take a small pencil brush
and I'm going to take the Roxy shade and
just run that along the inner part my
lower lashline away the outer part of my
lower lashline and the inner part my
lower lashline and leave the gap and
again on that side
I will say that is a really like
gorgeous color from me personally like
on my lower lash line because I've got
blue eyes and it's such a local vibrant
orange just making sure to keep that gap
in the middle because you want to like
mirror the halo eye effect a little I
will say though I thought it's like
pretty coming down low here longer than
punched an eye and then just on a flat
shader brush I'm going to take that dark
purple all style color and just press
that in to my lashline where I just
placed that Roxy shade oh and then just
go back in with the pencil brush I
haven't picked up any additional product
and we've got it to gone and look what
it look like when I applied and I'm just
trying to blend that out and it's gone
and actually it's gone down here onto my
face when I was like trying to show you
how they blend like where's that just
gone it's like I actually never even put
it there I'm not really sure how this is
going to work but I'm going to try and
put that lime green electric shade on
the middle part of my lower lash line
obviously to try and mimic air
where is it where's the color how do I
get the color to come out it's gone
really funny in my pan like look at that
that's when I used it with a brush like
you can see there's like texture to it
this is one like two completely flat and
barely like picks up anything on and it
might look like a lot but it's really
not okay a little bit is working and I
like shove it on with my finger it's
just messy I can't see what I'm doing
like I said we look at like you know
it's just like it just looks messy now
but I think that's like the best I'm
going to get so this is like what the
eye shadow looks like blended like the
best that I could and applied to the
best I could I don't know it's not like
this not act is not awful the blending
is not awful I'm just upset like the
pigmentation is so great when you swatch
it on your fingers it was at first on
your finger and like on your arm and so
all the pictures that you see that the
swatches i 100% believe that that is
like applied left hand like that's the
pigmentation but just do you not like do
try the palette before you like send it
out or like on the test shoots that they
did for it did they not did the makeup
artists not say anything to be like ah
there's a taking way too long because
the eyeshadows just won't blend I mean
it's not like that it's so hard it's not
like big didn't learn because that you
can see that they have I just feel like
they apply really weirdly it's just
weird but anyway I'm going to finish off
this look by applying mascara and lashes
and then just like a nude lips again all
the details like the lip option and
stuff will be on my Instagram but the
lashes I am going to use are the
populist lashes by Lily lashes just
because they're super fluttery and not
going to take any attention away from
the eyes in there maybe we might want to
yeah I'm just going to go ahead and
apply them and then I'll be back to show
you the finished lip and my final
thought okay so this is the finished
look I just quickly paired it with a
nude blush yes as you do because it's me
you know so I'm trying
and mixed feelings I love I love the
colors and I think that they're super
super pretty
they are so pigmented but the problem is
I feel like they're just too pigmented
so much so that they just can't even
cling on relief like your eye the maps I
think are actually workable you just
have to be patient and blend either
firmer blending brush specimens luckily
there's only like three and then I did
use two of them I can't use the white
ones but I mean the atom one applies
better with a finger hundred percent
maybe it just works but it was warm the
electric shade the formula of this one I
think actually might be different I
don't know why just because this one can
crumble and like it actually is kind of
workable this one you take a swatch and
it's now like compressed and I can't
really even pick up any you saw when I
put it underneath my eye really like
there wasn't any pigmentation at all and
you're obviously see in the close-up
stirred like what the makeup looks like
and that is me like actually really
trying to blend it as best as I can so
overall I would just say that this is a
weird palette I am disappointed in the
sense that you know and it's just it's
such a prestige brand you'd think that
they would just take the time and make
sure that there's none but there is
always room for mistakes like no matter
how good you are at anything you can
apply that to everything in line I'm not
one to bash a brand or a product you'll
never really see me talk that negatively
about things because I feel like just
because they don't work for me doesn't
mean they won't work for anyone if
you've gotten Anastasia Beverly Hills
Instagram you've seen the looks people
created with it like it's workable you
just have to be patient
it's a massive shame that so much
product is wasted because it can all
fall out as you saw in some of the clips
and from other people's reviews as well
but I'm sure this will just be like a
learning point for them they will take
the time make it better and they'll
probably come out with like the best
Anastasia Beverly Hills time all-time
and we'll all love it so I really hope
you guys like the look that I create
with this and enjoyed my kind of like
