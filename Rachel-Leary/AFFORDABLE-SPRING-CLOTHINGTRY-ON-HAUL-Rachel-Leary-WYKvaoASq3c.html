it's not a makeup tutorial I said I
wanted to kind of mix it up a little bit
more because I've been doing so many
makeup tutorials at the moment and so
many of you guys loved my previous year
it was more like makeup hair and outfit
so I thought I would do a bit of a
clothing haul and all of it is from
reliable websites some of those bits I
got or a bit more I'd be like expensive
item from this little website but it's
pretty much an avoidable coding haul
it's from Cosette misguided real saying
all that good stuff and some of it's
quite exciting because I got some stuff
for some event so I'm going to kind of
show you a little s innocence and all
that good stuff and I've left all the
links and the names of everything it's
down below so yeah let's go ahead and
jump straight into weird I feel like
I've been a coding all in a
brother okay so the first log close I
got off from misguided so the first
thing that I got and this is kind of
like with it will make sense it's for an
event I'm going to next week and it is
just a satin blazer and it's black it
puts slightly ruffled Michael bunched up
sleeves and I want it to kind of be more
of an oversized sit on your shoulder
type blazer so I'll show you the outfit
I plan to wear that I'll insert capes if
like the outfit that I wanted to wear
through all kinds yeah I just I had an
outfit idea in mind and I've been really
loving and satin at the moment and I do
have a good day so you know like they're
like a really nice jacket to wear you
don't want to wear like a full-on coat
or like a really long coat or something
I think they're like in spring you don't
want to be wearing any kind of thing too
thick and heavy especially event because
I think you get really hot so yeah I got
this black sat in a blazer colander how
much was well she had left links to it
down below and then the next thing I got
is actually to wear with that blazer at
the event like you said I'll show you
everything when it all comes together it
is a lightweight white chiffon shirt and
perfect for this time of year again just
like it because it's a lot of fever to
you slightly warm but as we're going
into spring and it's sunny like today as
such and I say this is going to be like
something really nice to throw on with a
pair two pair jeans or boots or
something probably wear this kind of
thing to like meetings or if I'm like
going out and you want to be like
smartcash this is such a good smart
casual outfit top off if that makes
sense cause it kind of
plunges quite low which I quite like
sometimes if you haven't already guessed
but no yeah it's very nice but I got
this to wear with the satin blazer and a
few other bits I've got here for the
event
so I'll put the full outfit on to show
you I keep saying that but yes that is
this white shirt I hate the next thing I
got from mascara was a bomber jacket and
I think I must have liked bomber jackets
every color but I've got this one in
Burgundy I smell like burgundy bit of a
trend at the moment and my red is my
favorite color so it's just a different
shade of red some of feeling like it and
this one's actually an oversized one but
it literally looked massive I got this
in a size I think like twelve or
something that I wanted to be a besides
and I didn't realize that it was already
oversized and so it's like super big but
I felt like this weekend I always like
to wear like an oversized jacket and
like bang my hair in a bun is like hoop
earrings and that kind of be like smart
casual to the eye radio like the feeling
additional it's really like a
lightweight as well I really hate like
oversized jackets a heavy and
uncomfortable because I mean literally
feel like you look just as dry and I'm
now walking a heavy mess code so I get I
got this one and like I said it's like
five candies like a bit of a trend at
the moment of wearing like different
shades even shades like baggy clothes
and I didn't have a kind of oversized
burgundy form attractive so yes that I
got that from the side too and then the
final clothing item i got from misguided
you guys have seen it in my get ready
with me just that I literally posted my
last video and it is this t-shirt it's
got a little bit of tan on except for to
the concert but is one of those a
plunging v-neck with a bit of a choker
in plain grey and these are really good
I find on like a Friday night house it
like on Fridays where I live it's never
like glam when you go out it's like
jeans and a nice top and boots and I
never family wait I've got so many
clothes but like I never can find a top
to wear so I thought this would be like
a good one you could wear maybe like a
long dangly necklace to kind of like
fill the gap that's been cut up your top
or something I didn't have it in gray
and I've got that just like black
trouser and like all that stuff and I
have so many black t-shirt so I thought
I'd get a different color pretty sure
they do other colors in this but
obviously I have linked it down below
now the final thing is that I got from
the sky actually a pair of shoes now I
feel like some people are going to think
what the or they're like not going
to be everyone's comes to you they're a
pair of boots so now only you know I
showed you that black satin bonnet what
that black satin blazer and the white
satin
sure so I envisioned wearing like an
oversized leave there like I showed you
the white shell I've got some black
satin shorts as well which is not
release guided that I'll show you that
in a sec and I thought it was such a
boring outfit I had one like this
statement shoes and then I saw these
from and misguided tadelakt thigh high
boots just like agree I really liked the
part in their black and white it almost
like a marbled effect and I thought what
a statement shoe like my outfit so like
plain I really needed a statement shoe
and I didn't want to go for like a
bright high heeled shoe and I did I
didn't want to wear bright side high
boots I thought I'd never wear them
again so I saw these and I was like
they're sick like I really like them
I'll show you the whole outfit put
together obviously I'll insert it here
with other clips of the other things I'm
wearing but yeah so I really like Lee
and I think they were slightly more
expensive but I have like a my sister's
that you need so I sometimes do I you
need a discount and I'm sure like the
loads of you guys the students as well
sufficient so you can get some discount
on them I'm sure but yeah I thought they
were just so different so cool I love a
good size idea so yeah I actually got
another pair of shoes and smiles and
they put patting on as well so along
with me I'm going to like the pattern
shoe right at the moment so that is
everything I got for misguided now I'll
show you I got from little things so
literally as I was just saying to go
with that outfit with the boots I got
some black cycling shorts literally just
to go with the Blazer and the shirt and
the boots of the event also I quite like
starting short because they're so much
more comfortable like between your legs
you don't pay for anything and they're
just really comfortable as well and I
thought we'd like to spring and summer
and stuff coming up I thought these
república summer as well and they just
go with glitter like anything it's did
you just a plain pair of black satin
shorts love that so I'll show you the
other pair of shoes I got a body from
pre-loading as well and they're like a
pair of snakeskin boots they're like
socks boots I think that they don't
really look at that and I've been seeing
loads of people wearing snakeskin boots
the moment I thought statement shoes
maybe that's like the way together or
you have this like white t-shirts and
black jeans there's like why I'm black
on her and they're reinstall
the moment and I'm side six in single
and a five six and shoes by the way
yeah I thought that they were like
really kind of just like unknown a nice
accessory for the springtime pretty sure
I saw a picture of Kim Kardashian she
was just wearing like a gray top and
like some ripped boyfriend jeans and
with these Lisa that's so effortless and
kind of right up my street I like
effortless but like stylish clothing
just something that's easy to wear so
yeah I got these boots pump real saying
again everything is linked down below
and then I thought these were called
these are sort of also from real things
the final thing these are some like
scream joggers I literally live in
joggers at the moment like give me any
different style of strawberries and I
love them and these ones are kind of
like laced up at the front which I
thought was really kind of in style in
the moment and really nice to just like
a cool designer just like the jogger so
it kind of makes them a bit more
acceptable to wear them out maybe if you
wanted to get these are their kind of
cream not wipe their cream and yet a
superb really like fluffy and warm as
well and yeah I just really liked a
little extra detail I can't wait to win
and they'll I can't member where I saw
someone talking about them but like tip
them enough yeah I just would like a
bloody sue or something like that I
thought these are really cool
and I feel like a lot of you guys
wouldn't think it'd be like this sure
some of the Styles you guys keep
treating you saying let me do and that's
why you guys want to see these clothing
also yeah I'll leave the link to these
down below too so the next few bits I
got was from Missy Empire now listen to
reason why I didn't film at this the
other day because this I would even
expect it really didn't come in here it
came yesterday so it's here now but this
is what I wanted to wear to the weekend
concert the other day by the way which
was incredible if you didn't see my
snapchats
I've got classic saying when you're like
singing in the background if you
snapchat but you don't realize at the
time so I was paying about the next day
as you see in the background being like
yeah yeah anyway so I got this black and
red checkered shirt like designed to be
oversized I think I think I got it in
like a sign I think they had it in like
small to medium medium to large large
extra large I think I just got the
medium to large self I want it to be a
decisive yeah it looks pretty big so
yeah I got this I kind of got this just
to wear maybe with like jeans or you
know you just tie around your waist
or you don't even like do up
whereas I can layer so you're not
wearing having to wear a coat and I've
been really loving a black and red at
the moment and yes so that is from mithy
empire source you might got bundle up
the sides going to roll up the sleeves
or pocket did you try to kind of capture
but it's not I really kind of recite the
pattern of this one rather than like
this smaller check for like the proper
like lucky check so I thought this one
that was a little less out there but I
mean there's only so much left out that
you can get many back of my texture but
yes that is a lot again then the next
thing I got was actually attracts you
and it is a navy blue like velvet valor
type track sea thing these are the
druggers and like this is the top I
wasn't a massive fan of the velvet trend
especially when it was like silver
velvet and like baby pink velvet and
like I feel like it was more like the
bright Velvets I was like I was like no
if you really can't get boarded that but
I really like the burgundy and the Navy
Velvets I think actually look quite like
luxurious but I think you can wear them
a bit more subtly and I prefer that 100%
so I just got this just kind of like
around around the house and all like
maybe just wear the top with like jeans
can move quite like a fitted top it's
not like baggy it's quite like a fitted
top so I would actually probably wear
this like on a day to day if I out and
about I think I tried this on last night
just to try it on and I put like
somebody engine and had like some jeans
on am I having by actually like Jen
didn't end up wearing it when I was
going but I really liked it did it look
to you casual I mean I probably wouldn't
wear the joggers like Albert or like the
whole matching thing together our outfit
just got this is something to kind of
like lounge around in because I land
around a lot so I need lounge about
clothes
so yeah I got these I know they did
loads of other colors as well so
definitely you're interested in one have
a look and the final thing I got was a
sheep I just doing it is a wool it is
just a white jacket now I have a navy
blue one of these and I love it but I've
been seeing those in pictures of people
just kind of obviously wearing it just
kind of over the shoulder I draped over
the shoulder and when everybody turns
wearing a white one just like brought
out the color in their eyes and just
kind of was a bit more which is kind of
a bit more subtle as I make sense even
though it's like bright white but I just
always wanted one and I saw that
had one I think it's kind of a slightly
more a pricier item but for what
compared to like other fur coats this is
faux fur obviously but compared to
others I feel like it's quite a good
price yeah I basically just kind of got
this manual to wears like events and
stuff maybe to just cuddle at night time
is super soft I just kind of got this
coat over your shoulder maybe to kind of
just dress up a more casual outfit could
literally wear this with like jeans and
boots and just wrap look waxes are the
top and I feel like it would dress it up
a lot more so yeah that is the final
item that I got from this empire and
then the one last clothing item I got
was just from boohoo and it is a
bodysuit
and this is just like a red can you tell
another in a black yarn ad this is just
like a red and black lace bodysuit
literally just got this - obviously
website black jeans maybe or even
microscope you wants like dress up but I
kind of envision me wearing this is like
black jeans black boots black bummer and
then maybe just like a red lipstick but
it kind of got that belted you can't
pretty see that kind of belted across
detailing which can kind of like
you in a little bit but yeah it's just
like a lace bodysuit don't we think you
can wear about it be honest just got to
cover up them lips and where I never
wear bra with bodies used to be honest I
just can't be arsed and always it's an
option to not wear a bar as I'm not
wearing it yeah it's a sipper like
comfortable and lace material it feels
like super stretchy as well so I haven't
actually tried it on yet but it should
be super come so you can see everything
sort of label amongst I've been waiting
to try on few guys this haul but yeah I
really really like it and it's like not
to like underwear II that you'd be like
girl why the hell are you wearing that
out I really like this one and it ran
black which is my favorite colors as
well and that is the final item so I
