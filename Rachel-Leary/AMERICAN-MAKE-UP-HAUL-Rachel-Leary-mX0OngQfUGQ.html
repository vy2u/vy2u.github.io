as you guys know if you follow me on my
social medias like Instagram Twitter or
snapchat last week I was in America
visiting my sister
and I promised you guys and told you
guys that I was going to be doing a bit
of makeup shopping and I hope I haven't
disappointed I went to Sephora I think
every day and I was only there for like
four days it's not that bad but I think
I went to support everyday I went to an
altar and I got like a few little bits
from Bath and Body Works and it's not
makeup but I got a couple of perfumes so
I thought if I show you guys the kind of
perfumes I got it kind of gives you an
insight into the kind of sense I'm into
and yeah get to know me a bit better so
let's start with what I got ah altar so
the main reason I wanted to go to altar
was to look at lorac just because I've
always wanted to get one of their
palettes and I wasn't sure which one I
wanted to get I know that oldest ring is
the only place that gets them but I know
they also do other kind of High Street I
street like Superdrug boots drugstore
that kind of stuff so the lorac palette
I decided to go for which I am wearing
on my eyes right now is the lorac
unzipped palette which basically looks
like this so it's loads of really nice
like rose gold movie kind of tones I was
going now with the intention of getting
the lorac Pro palette the number one
when I start was actually gonna
disappointed outside it's not as nice as
these and I think I would wear these
colors a lot more like I really liked
all this shimmery shades in this one so
so excited about that and it comes with
a little primer so I think that for my
desk but yeah so I got the lorac
unzipped palette I also got two things
from the Kardashian beauty range I got
two of their joy sticks this one is in
the shade modern mode and this one and
this one's in the shade love hangover so
that's the modern move and that's the
love hangover so basically that's just
kind of like creamy
let pencils pretty nice formula actually
never really like I said pretty creamy
really nourishing on the lip and
obviously I got there to nude runs
because that's the kind of color I would
like to wear the most and I just thought
for like an everyday let that these two
would be a really nice and I think you
can get Kardashian beauty on you can get
them on a UK website and I just told you
for one it's called if I remember I will
insert it there also from also I got
this lip pencil by NYX in the shade pale
pink so it looks like that and I just
thought I could wear that with some of
my NYX lip cream like in the shade Cairo
and it's kind of like a cool tawny pink
pencil so I thought that was a bit
different from some of the other ones I
had yeah that was the only thing I got
from NYX just because you can get NYX in
the UK so I didn't want to get loads of
NIC stuff but they had so much stuff in
stock of NYX in the alter rather than
like their target that I went to I could
get a few bits from Target so I'll show
you then but yeah so I thought I would
get this one and two other things I got
from altar which I haven't seen in the
UK but I haven't actually been into a
Superdrug or boots in a long time so
excuse me if these are actually in stock
in the UK I just haven't seen them yet
are these things they are the Maybelline
and Baby Lips and moisturizing lip
glosses so I have si got the two paler
nude ones
let me see they actually have names so I
don't know if you can see it but this
one is called taupe with me and this one
is called like a peach ah there's no
police watching these because they're
not really very pigmented in color like
they'll just look really clear on my
hand but yeah like I said I just thought
they were really interesting I've not
actually seen them before so I don't
know if they've not just come out here
yet or I just haven't been introduced
with super drugs in a while but yeah I
thought these are really interesting
just as like it says a moisturizing lip
gloss on days when can't really bothered
to wear anything but want your lips to
look like they've got something on I
think these would be really pretty and
they're really cute as well just like
school and let my name is Ed everyday so
two other things that I got kind of and
the drugstore is
I got from Target so I got this blush
from ELF in the shade tickled pink and
it said new so I was really interested
because it was like a new shade that
they'd come outwards
it looks like that so it's a really soft
pink like you guys know I'm not a
massive blush wearer I do like the paler
pink shades so this one really called
out to me sorry for the middle finger
yeah so like I said it's like a really
pale pink shade I'm wearing it today but
it's quite a subtle blush but that is
why I like it but yeah elf is so so
cheap and I think they definitely have a
UK website but I'm not actually owned
anything from them before so I thought I
would pick this up to try it out I
really like it so far and that's the elf
blush in tickled pink and another thing
I was super excited about in target Wars
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation I'd seen desi Perkins
literally rave about this and I thought
I have to give it a go I got it in the
shade to to a soft tan so it is kind of
more like my tan color but I tried it on
for the airport this is the foundation I
watched the earth war and I really liked
it it's really really mad and that's not
normally something that I go for but I
think for like nights and stuff like
that this is a really good drugstore
like cheaper foundation to get and not
sure if it's in the UK yet but if it
does I definitely recommend picking it
up so I'm moving on aha what I got at
Sephora oh I've been like holding back
using all this stuff before filming this
video so I think because part of me are
there today everything basically that's
on my face is new I took out the
packaging to say throw up the packaging
it's but unnecessary okay so let's stop
with something that's a bit more on the
boring side I just hope to get a Sephora
mask this is the honey mask so it is the
nourishing and balancing one I
definitely just wanted to get a mask
from Sephora own brand stuff just
because you definitely definitely can't
get support own brand stuff in the UK I
got one of these and I can't wait
out my sister got the map one that
multiplies your skin and she tried it
out while I was out there and then ended
up buying it again when we went again so
I think obviously that one's really good
so I have high hopes for this while I'm
speaking of masks I got the I don't know
how to pronounce Brown I think it's
Oscar luminizing a black mask if you
guys follow me on snapchat you saw me
trying that out while I was out there
just because this was a free gift
because of the points that I had and
yeah this is what I decided to pick as
my free gift and I really liked oh boy I
got the next day on my skin it felt baby
but smooth so liked this one and the
other mask that I got just because it
was travel size in the little bit way
you're queuing up in Sephora I swear the
minis always get me is the the glam glow
hydrating mud mask I've got a little
tester of the black one as well but
anything that says hydrating I'm really
interested in because my skin is quite
dry so I'm really excited to try this
out I've heard mixed reviews about grime
go glam glow I've tried it before and
I've quite liked it but I've seen a few
reviews of people that like really don't
like it but yeah I'm excited to try this
one then I kind of had a bit crazy with
the face products just because I've
really wanted to make the most of it
being slightly cheaper out there and
trying other brands so I got the Kat Von
D look it's a tooth Foundation and if
you guys watched some of my other videos
you guys know that I've actually tried
this before this time I just got a
different shape so this time I got
medium 57 which is slightly more of a
golden yellow undertone whereas the one
I had before was I think medium 54 and
that just had slightly rosier undertones
to it and I definitely prefer having
something with slightly more golden
undertone especially when I'm turning
and stuff like that this foundation is
really full-coverage matte finish I
literally love it I'm so glad I got
another one because this is kind of a
really good one for nights out as well
just obviously it was a bit more
expensive but yeah I literally know if
this foundation and you definitely can't
get Kat Von D in the UK which is such a
shame but I definitely recommend if you
want to do a Sephora order because they
do ship see
okay the shipping is just a bitch in
terms of pricing so when I ever used to
order from Sephora I'd get like a bulb
load of stuff so the shipping seemed
worth it I definitely recommend picking
up this foundation and the foundation I
got because of our easy if you follow
her on snapchat or Instagram or like
anything her face looks flawless all the
time and you think it's a filter and
then you watch like snapshots of people
that I've met her before and they say
like she looks exactly the same in
person he could add that she does in her
photo so it's like not a filter and she
always says that she uses the hover
effects cream foundation so it looks
like that and it's like in a compact you
can see I've just tried it out a little
bit I'm still figuring out the best way
to apply this I've kind of just been
tapping my brush into it and like
brushing onto my face I don't know if
any of you guys have tried it let me
know how you guys apply it but it's full
coverage and she says that she mixes it
where's the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation so I picked this one up I
already have it in the shade six and 6.5
but they're both quite olivey all of
these shades my friend Alma told me to
get the shade seven because one that's
one amory's he uses and two it's not
that much darker then like just cuz it's
the next shade down it's not just gonna
be a dog or if it's actually much nicer
on to turn to her and she was right so
I've mixed these two and I'm wearing
them on my face right now and I'm really
impressed with them I love them both I
already loved this foundation I just
really wanted to try this one
and I got this one in the shade at g50
and like I said this one is in the shade
7 some more face products that I've got
I've already had it before and you can't
get it in the UK's these can all get so
you can get these all in the UK I'm just
telling you what I got
so I restocked on my Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer in the shade like warm
this hands-down is literally the best
concealer ever like definitely in my top
3 it's so light weight but it's gives
amazing coverage at the same time and if
you guys still haven't tried it out I
definitely
doing it I only just finished my old one
and I've got it like months months ago
and I wear concealer every day so it
lasts a really long time as well like
you barely need any for it to go a long
way so I picked up another one of them
and then like I said the minis in the
check out of Sephora alike
they've just call my name they're so
cute because they're so small and they
do minis of really really good products
so I got two little mini NARS radiant
concealers and you can like see how
small they are
so like this cuz I only picked them up
because they were English I knew I was
kind of nearly running out of mine and
the two shades that they had as their
testers were custard and vanilla
I've tried custard before love custard
sauce I definitely wanna get a mini one
of them and the only other shade of that
can see that I've tried is Chantilly
which is the lightest one because I
really like that on for highlighting
like having really bright under eyes so
I thought I'll try out the shape Anila
and see how that one works and I'm
wearing it today and I think it's a bit
more subtle in terms of its still
highlighting under my eyes but it's not
as bright as Chantilly so I'm really
glad I picked these two up and they are
so small and so cute I love it then I
got a couple of bits from Too Faced I
picked up the Too Faced glitter or the
shadow insurance clear - clear
I've been dying for like a glitter glue
I've always used like eyelash glue which
is really good in terms of like the
glitter sticks like because it's eyelash
glue but this one is a bit more of a
more comfortable product and the glitter
really does stay I breathe like it I
wore it then the day I did like a
glitter liner and use this as my glue
and it was really good it just stuck
straight away but it's almost like
creamier it's not really really sticky
it's a good creamy formula and it works
really well and everyone always told me
to get it so finally it picked up while
I was out there and if you're wondering
what's on my lips it is the Too Faced
melted lipstick in the shade
I think this is one of the newer colors
that they came out with I don't know if
you can get it in the UK yet I'd never
looked
only when I was there looking at the
stand before I was like oh my god yeah
they came out with new shades like let
me get one and this one reminds me of
flash pop from Mac so it's like really
light let me show you it is this shade
here it's a really nice nude
I am currently wearing it with oak lip
pencil and a lip gloss on the top which
I will show you in a second but yeah
I really like the formula with these
they have a matte finish just on their
own
I obviously put a Glossip that's up with
them now there yeah really like this
color I can tell it's gonna be one of my
go-to nude shades from now on so like I
said I have a gloss on at the moment the
gloss I am wearing is the buxom full-on
lip cream in the shade White Russian
which looks like this it kind of looks
clear but it does have like a baby pink
like tint to it and I thought this was
just a lip gloss but it's like a
plumping lip whilst as well so it gives
your lips that tingly feeling which I
wasn't aware of but I like my lips look
bigger anyway so I really like this I
wanted to get definitely something from
either bite Beauty or buxom just because
that's a lip or like a cosmetic company
they you definitely
I don't think store like anywhere in the
UK sells it so I definitely wanted to
pick this up and I love the color spray
on its own right on the top of anything
it's just one of those really nice soft
paint colors that looks really
flattering on the lip so that is the
buxom full-on lip cream in White Russian
coming up towards at the end now I
picked Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper
I am so so so excited to try it I kind
of debated on getting it on like the
first day and I thought no like I
recently just found the liner that I
liked like I don't need another one and
then came to the last day and I was like
I know I'm gonna really regret it if I
don't get it and try out so I'm so
excited to try it I'm not normally a fan
of felt-tip liners but this one let me
show you the end is like super thin so
you're gonna get really really sharp
point to this so you guys know I love my
winged liner so I definitely
have to get this one and try it out and
I'll probably use in a tutorial and I
will let you know what I think about it
the final kind of makeup item I got from
Sephora I saw on the very last day I was
leaving I totally forgot about this
product I always always always really
wanted it and then I know I just like
forgot it existed and then I saw it
while I was there and I was like oh my
god I have to get it so it is the Make
Up For Ever sculpting do a look in the
shade too so it looks like this I
definitely got it more for this shade
but this is a really nice bronzer as
well have you forgot that this existed
and I've always wanted to try it like
I'm kind of like late on the bandwagon
with this one just because I think
people raved about this like a couple
months ago and that's when I was really
wanting to get it in there and I never
did so yeah that makeup
ever sculpting a duo in number two I'm
the highlight just not as pigmented as I
saw it's really similar to all the
shades that have come out recently like
Mac oh darling laura geller gilded honey
estate over Hills so Hollywood there
it's that kind of color it's still
really subtle and really pretty so I
really like that one oh my god Kate said
that's all the makeup that I got in
America and I hate and love myself at
the same time for but yeah so that was
all the makeup that I got in America now
I'm just going to show you a few little
bits I got from Bath and Body Works I
know it's not kind of like as exciting
but to give you an idea of the kind of
accents and stuff I'm into so I picked
up three of their body sprays one in
warm vanilla sugar one in a thousand
wishes and one in a velvet sugar which
is my all-time favorite scents and Bath
and Body Works I think you can get these
off of Amazon I'm pretty sure because
I've definitely had this one before and
I ordered it from Amazon off a whim and
oh my god if you know the sin you know
how sweet this is and how like sugary
and oh my god it's like my dream scent
and I got the corresponding moisturizer
as well so I can constantly smell
beautiful
all the time it's literally smells
incredible then I breathe wanted to get
like a big candle but I thought
realistically kinda in my suitcase give
me a freaking nightmare so I got two
mini ones oh my god
cinnamon caramel swirl I got Christmassy
Ron and Mary cookie can't wait to start
fighting damn but I can feel like a real
girl with perfect body wax candles yay I
definitely wanna get more there was this
peach one and a just plain salted
caramel one but I really wanted to get
they didn't do many ones and they just
did these massive ones they thought
they're not gonna fit in my suitcase oh
I'll stick with these two so that is the
end of my massive makeup haul I really
