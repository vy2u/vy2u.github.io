as you guys know if you follow me on my
social medias like Instagram Twitter or
snapchat last week I was in America
visiting my sister and I promised you
guys and told you guys that I was going
to be doing a bit of makeup shopping and
I hope I haven't disappointed i went to
sephora i think every day and I was only
there for like four days it's not that
bad but i think i went to a support
every day i went to an altar and they
got like a few little bits from Bath and
Body Works I know that's not makeup but
I got a couple of perfume so I thought
if I show you guys the kind of perfumes
I got it kind of gives you an insight
into the kind of sense i'm into and yeah
get to know me a bit better so let's
start with what I got at Ulta so the
main reason I wanted to go to alter was
to look at the rack just because i've
always wanted to get one of their
palates and i wasn't sure which one I
wanted to get I know that oldest ring is
that only post it gets in but I know
they also do other kind of high street I
street like superdrug boots drugstore
that kind of stuff so the lorac palette
I decided to go for which I am wearing
on my eyes right now is the lorac
unzipped palette which basically looks
like this so it's loads of really nice
like rose gold movie kind of tones I was
going now with the intention of getting
the lorac Pro palette the number one
when I start was actually disappointed
on so it's not as nice as these and I
think I would wear these colors a lot
more like I really liked all the
shimmery shades in this one so so
excited about that and it comes with a
little primers are basing that on my
desk but yeah so I got the lorac
unzipped palette I've also got two
things from the Kardashian beauty range
I got two of their joysticks this one is
in the shade modern move and this one
and this one's in the shade love
hangover so that's the modern move and
that's the love hangover so basically
that's just kind of like creamy
lip pencils pretty nice formula actually
never really like I said really creamy
really nourishing on the lip and
obviously I got there too nude ones
because that's the kind of color i would
like to wear the most and I just thought
for like an everyday lip that these two
would be a really nice and I think you
can get Kardashian beauty on you can get
them on a UK website and I'm just Tony
for one it's called if i remember i will
insert it they're also from also i got
this lip pencil by necks in the shade
pale pink so it looks like that and i
just thought i could wear that with some
of my NYX lip cream like in the shade
Cairo and it's kind of like a cool Tony
pink pencil so I thought that was a bit
different from some of the other ones i
had see how that was the only thing I
got from NYX just because you can get
nicks in the UK so I didn't want to get
loads of Nick stuff but they had so much
stuff in stock of Nick's in the altar
rather than like the target that i went
to i could get a few bits from target
i'll show you then but um yeah so I
thought I would get this one and two
other things that i got from altar which
I hadn't seen in the UK but I haven't
actually been into a super drug or boots
in a long time so excuse me if these are
actually in stock in the UK I just
haven't seen them yet are these things
they are the Maybelline at baby lips
moisturizing lip glosses so I obviously
got the two paler nude ones let me see
they actually have names so i don't know
if you can see it but this one is called
um taupe with me and this one is called
life's a peach ah there's no police
watching these because they're not
really very pigmented in color like
they'll just look really clear on my
hand but yeah like I said I just thought
they were really interesting I'd not
actually see them before so I don't know
they've not just come out here yet or I
just hadn't been introduced for
superdrug in a while but yeah I thought
these really interesting just as like it
says a moisturizing lip gloss on days
when not really bothered to anything but
want your lips to look like they've got
something on I think these would be
really pretty and there any cute as well
just like school and like I said every
day so two other things I got kind of in
the drugstore is
I got from Target so i got this blush
from elf in the shade tickled pink and
it said new so i was really interested
because it was like a new shade that
they'd come out words it looks like
that's what's a really soft pink like
you guys know I'm not a massive blush
wearer I do like the paler pink shades
so this one really called out to me
sorry for the middle finger but yeah so
like I said it's like a really pale pink
shade I'm wearing it today but it's
quite a subtle flush but that is why I
like it but yeah elf is so so cheap and
I think they definitely have a UK
website but i'm not actually owned
anything from them before so i thought i
would pick this up to try it out and i
really like it so far and that's the elf
blush in tickled pink and another thing
I was super excited about in target wars
maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation I'd seen it desi Perkins
literally rave about this and I thought
I have to give it a go I got it in the
shade to to a soft tan so it is kind of
more like my tan color but I tried on
for the airport this is the foundation
ever watched the airport and I really
liked it it's really really mad that's
not normally something that I go for but
I think for like nights out and stuff
like that this is a really good
drugstore um like cheaper foundation to
get and not sure if it's in the UK yet
but if it does i definitely recommend
picking it up so I'm moving on Oh what I
got at Sephora oh I've been like holding
back using all this stuff and before
filming this video so I hope you guys
proud of me are there today everything
basically that's on my face is new I
took out the packaging just a thought up
the packaging it's but unnecessary okay
so let's start with something that's a
bit more on the boring side I just hope
to get a Sephora mask this is the honey
mask so it is the nourishing and
balancing one I definitely just wanted
to get a mask from Sephora own brand
stuff just because you definitely
definitely can't get support own brand
stuff in the UK I got one of these and I
can't wait to try out my sister got the
map one that multiplies your skin
and she tried it out while I was out
there and then ended up buying it again
when we went again so I think obviously
that one's really good so I have high
hopes for this one I'm speaking of masks
I got the I don't know how to pronounce
brown I think it's Oscar luminizing a
black mask if you guys follow me on
snapchat you saw me trying that out
while I was out there just because this
was a free gift because of the points I
had and yeah this is what I decided to
pick as my free gift and I really liked
oh we got the next day and my skin felt
baby butt smooth so liked this one and
the other mask that I got just because
it was travel size in the little bit
where you're queuing up in sephora i
swear the minis always get me is the
glam glow hydrating mud mask I've got a
little tester of the black one as well
but anything that says hydrating and I'm
really interested in because my skin is
quite dry so I'm really excited to try
this out I've heard mixed reviews about
Graham go glam glow I've tried it before
and I've quite liked it but I've seen a
few of use of people that like really
don't like it but yeah I'm excited to
try this long then I kind of had a bit
crazy with the face products just
because I really wanted to make the most
of it being slightly cheaper out there
and trying other brands so I got the kat
von d look it's a tooth foundation and
if you guys watched some of my other
videos you guys know that I've actually
tried this before this time I just got a
different shape so this time I got me
Liam 57 which is slightly more of a
golden yellow undertone whereas the one
I had before was I think medium 54 and
that just had slightly Rosie undertones
to it and I definitely prefer having
something with slightly more golden
undertone especially when I'm fake
tanning and stuff like that this
foundation is really full-coverage matte
finish I literally love it i'm so glad i
got another one because this is kind of
a really good one for nights out as well
just obviously it was a bit more
expensive but yeah I literally live this
foundation and you definitely can't get
Kat Von D in the UK which is such a
shame but i definitely recommend if you
want to do asif or order because they do
ships the UK the shipping is just a
bitch in terms of pricing so when I ever
used to order from Sephora I'd get like
a bulb load of stuff so the shipping
seemed worth it I definitely recommend
picking up this foundation and the
foundation I got because of a breezy if
you follow how on snapchat or Instagram
or like anything her face looks flawless
all the time and you think it's a filter
and then you watch like snapshots of
people that have met her before and they
say like she looks exactly the same in
person it odd that she does in her photo
so it's like not a filter and she always
says that she uses the hover effects
cream foundation so it looks like that
and it's like in a compact you can see
I've just tried it out a little bit I'm
still figuring out the best way to apply
this I've kind of just been tapping my
brush into it and like brush it onto my
face I don't know give any of you guys
have tried it let me know how you guys
apply it but it's full coverage and she
says that she mixes it where's the
giorgio armani nameless silt foundation
so i picked this one up I already have
it in the shade six and six point five
but they're both quite olivi all of
these shades my friend Alma told me to
get the shade seven because one that's
one Amory's he uses and two it's not
that much darker then like just because
it's the next shade down it's not just
gonna be a dog all of its actual much
nicer one to turn to and she was right
so I've mixed these two and i'm wearing
them on my face right now and i'm really
impressed with them i love them both I
already loved this foundation I just
really wanted to try this one and I got
this one in the shade g50 and like I
said this one is in the shade seven some
more face products that I've got I've
already had it before and you can't get
in the UK's then you can all get you can
get these all in the UK and just telling
you what I got so i restocked on my
urban decay naked skin concealer in the
shade like warm this hands down is
literally the best concealer ever like
definitely in my top three it's so
lightweight but it gives amazing
coverage at the same time and you guys
still haven't tried it out i definitely
recommend doing it i only just finished
my old one and i've got it like months
months ago and i wear concealer every
day
a so it lasts a really long time as well
like you barely need any for it to go a
long way so I picked up another one of
them and then like I said the minis in
the check out of sephora alike they've
just call my name they're so cute
because they're so small and they do
minis of really really good products so
I got two little mini NARS radiant
concealers if you can like see how small
they are that like this cuz I only
picked them up because they were English
I knew I was kind of nearly running out
of mine and the two shades that they had
as their testers were custard and
vanilla I've tried custard before love
custard sauce I definitely want to get
em any one of them and the only other
shade of that concealer I've tried is
Chantilly which is the lightest one
because I really like that one for
highlighting like having really bright
under eyes so I thought I'll try out the
shape and I'll and see how that one
works and I'm wearing it today and I
think it's a bit more subtle in terms of
its still highlighting under my eyes but
it's not as bright as Chantilly so I'm
really glad I picked these two up and
they are so small and so cute i love it
then i got a couple of bits from Too
Faced i picked up the two-faced glitter
or the shadow insurance critically I've
been dying for like a glitter glue I've
always used like eyelash glue which is
really good in terms of like the glitter
sticks like because it's eyelash glue
and but this one is a bit more of a more
comfortable product and the Glitter
really does stay i really like it i wore
it then the day i did like a glitter
liner and use this as my glue and it was
really good it just stuck straight away
but it's almost like creamy it's not
really really sticky it's like a creamy
formula and it works really well and
everyone always told me to get it so
finally picked up while i was out there
and if you're wondering what on my lips
it is he to face melted lipstick in the
shade melted sugar i think this is one
of the newer colors that they came out
with I don't know you can get it in the
UK yet I'd never looked on it's only
when i was there looking at the stand
that's for i was like oh my god yeah
they came out with new shades like let
me go on and this one reminds me of
flash pot from mac so it's like really
light let me
it is this shade here it's a really nice
nude I am currently wearing it with oak
lip pencil and a lip gloss on the top
which I will show you in a second but
yeah I really like the formula at these
they have a matte finish just on their
own I obviously put a Glossop that's up
there now but yeah really like this
color I can tell it's give any one of my
go-to nude shades from now on so like I
said I have a gloss on at the moment the
gloss I am wearing is the buxom full-on
lip cream in the shade White Russian
which looks like this it kind of looks
clear but it does have like a baby pink
light tint to it I thought this was just
a lip gloss but it's like a plumping lip
whilst as well so it gives your lips
that tingly feeling which I wasn't aware
of but I like my lips look bigger anyway
so I really like this I wanted to get
definitely something from either bite
beauty or bug them just because that's a
lip or like a cosmetic company they you
definitely I don't think store like
anywhere in the UK sells it so I
definitely wanted to pick this up and I
love the color spray on its own right on
the top of anything it's just one of
those really nice soft paint colors that
looks really flattering on the lips oh
that is the buxom for long lip cream in
white russian coming up towards at the
end now I picked up Kat Von D tattoo
liner in trooper I am so so so excited
to try it I kind of debated on gang it
on like the first day and I thought no
like I recently just found the line as I
like like I don't like need another one
and then came to the last day and I was
like I know I'm gonna really regret it
if I don't get it and try out so I'm so
excited to try I'm not normally a fan of
felt tip liners but this one let me show
you the end is like super thin um so
you're going to get really really sharp
point to this so you guys know I love my
winged liner so I definitely have to get
this one and try it out and I'll
probably use in a tutorial at now will
let you know what I think about it the
final kind of makeup item that i got
from sephora i saw on the very last day
I was leaving I totally forgot about
this product
I always always always really wanted it
and then I I know I just like forgot
existed and then I saw it while I was
there and I was like oh my god I have to
get it so it is the Make Up For Ever
sculpting do that in the shade too so it
looks like this I definitely got it more
for this shade but this is a really nice
bronzer as well how'd you forgot that
this existed and I've always wanted to
try it like it I'm kind of like late on
the bandwagon with this one just because
I think people raved about this like a
couple months ago and that's when i was
really wanting to get it and then I
never did so yeah the makeup ever
sculpting a duo in number two I the
highlight is not as pigmented as I saw
it's really similar to all the shades
that have come out recently like Mac oh
darling laura geller gilded honey I
station over the hill so Hollywood
brother it's that kind of color it's
still really subtle and really pretty so
I really like that one oh my god Kate
said that's all the makeup that I got in
America and uh huh I hate and love
myself at the same time for but yeah so
that was all the makeup that I got in
America now I'm just going to show you a
few little bits i got from bob &amp;amp; Body
Works I know it's not kind of like as
exciting but i'm screaming idea of the
kind of accents and stuff i'm into so i
picked up three of their body sprays one
in warm vanilla sugar one in a thousand
wishes and one in a velvet sugar which
is my all-time at favorite scent from
bath and body works i think you can get
these off amazon i'm pretty sure because
I've definitely had this one before and
I ordered it from amazon off a whim and
oh my god if you know the sin you know
how sweet this is and how like sugary
and oh my god it's like my dream sent
and I got the corresponding moisturizer
as well so I can constantly smell
beautiful all the time it's literally
smells incredible and then I really
wanted to get like a big candle by
thought realistically kinda in my
suitcase give me a freaking nightmare so
I got two mini ones oh my god
cinnamon caramel swirl I got Christmas
Iran and Mary cookie can't wait to stop
burning damn but I can feel like a real
girl with perfect body wax candles yeah
I definitely want to get more there was
this peach one and a just plain salted
caramel one but I really wanted to get
they didn't do mini ones and they just
did these massive ones i thought they're
not gonna fit in my suitcase so i'll
stick with these two so that is the end
of my massive makeup pull i really hope
