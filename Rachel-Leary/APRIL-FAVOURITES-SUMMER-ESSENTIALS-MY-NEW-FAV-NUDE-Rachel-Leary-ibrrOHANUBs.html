to my channel so better late than never
but you guys seem to love my favourites
videos and they're actually one of my
favorite videos to watch over other
peoples and to also film cuz I love
sharing a new product with you guys that
I have been loving over the past month
so this kind of food roots video
includes lots of summer essentials my
favorite nude lip combination at the
moment which I'm wearing right now and
also some skin care and just other
exciting stuff so give this video a
thumbs up if you're excited already
but before we get started make sure to
eight that subscribe button and the
notification bell and let me know in the
comment section down below when you have
it so you can be in trance before I
shout out and this week's post
notification bell shout-out goes to Jen
Walters that says notification bell is
definitely on you're my absolute
favorite youtuber I love you girl oh
thank you so much I love you too I love
reading - or your comments your support
doesn't go unnoticed so have your moment
so that further do let's go ahead and it
gets started
so the first two products I've been
loving at the moment are kind of more
skin care based I've been loving the
doctor Dennis gross hyaluronic marine
oil-free moisture cushion I feel like I
use this in every video recently it's
what I used to prep my skin it's such a
wet feel moisturized which you guys know
I'm obsessed with but sometimes wet free
moisturizers can be a little bit oily
and like just a little bit too wet and
they're not so great unless you're gonna
be using a primer afterwards I feel like
this I don't really need a primer
afterwards every pro makeup artist that
I've ever really spoken to says that
they don't really believe in primers
they don't use primers especially if
you're taking your makeup off a lot and
redoing it so if you're a pro makeup
artist I feel like this would be a
really great moisturizer to have in your
kit it really hydrates the skin but
doesn't leave any oily residue so makeup
really stays on but I have been using
this product also in combination with it
this is the I'm very useful makeup
boomer buy it touch insole both of these
are actually available on a cult beauty
and I think it's how I got introduced to
them they were like kinda new in
products I got send them to try and I
have been loving them a touch and saw is
a Korean makeup brand and I love their
stuff I've always had a really great
thing about Asian skin care and how it's
like the best and I need to try and I've
been really loving this it almost acts
like Mac strobe cream like it's got that
pearlescent finish I think this does
have priming qualities to it and it's
got that kind of like spatula applicator
so I love kind of moisturizing and
priming my skin with this but also
making my skin glow and priming my skin
with this so I've been loving using
these two together now kind of more on
to the makeup side of things I've been
using these in pretty much every video I
wonder if you guys can guess what they
are before I say but they are the
stealer glitter and glow liquid
eyeshadows like I love these so much
they do such an amazing at color range
as well my two favorites are like kitten
karma I have this shade kitten karma but
there is a shade called kitten so are
they like different cuz obviously this
one's a competing mini one I got in a
set but let me know if you one of you
guys out there has
kitten and kitten karma like I'll be the
same I don't know and I also love rose
gold retro they are my favorite thing to
wear I've got kitten karma on right now
they literally just relied on with a
little applicator if you're like me and
just like to look glam but really
quickly this is so good just like couple
of crease colors whack this on the lid a
little bit of a blend looks like you put
so much effort into it and they do so
many amazing like nude everyday colors
but like I said they also do really fun
colors like paint green blue all sorts
so I've been loving these just to add
like a little bit of sparkle to every
look and kind of to be thrown on the
floor
no but seriously these are just amazing
like they just glide on so easily adds
the perfect like pop of sparkle to your
makeup look
I've just been reaching loving and
obsessing over them over the past month
I feel like the glitter trend is coming
back so I love these another kind of
makeup product that I've been loving at
the moment is the mac fix+ but in the
gold light edition I feel like this just
gives your skin the most gorgeous glow
don't get me wrong I love the iconic
London ones I literally like I'm
obsessed with them but one of them is
kind of more of like a party normal glow
type finish and the other one is gifts
more like a bronzy glow type finish this
one is like a golden glow type finish so
I've been loving this I literally use it
kind of before my makeup during my
makeup after my makeup just like the
iconic London ones I've just been
reaching for this one a little bit more
because I like the gold nurse too it's
like during the day but I like my iconic
London the bronze one for like the
nighttime and I want that kind of
bronzed glow but yet this you can use it
all over your body like face everything
so I thought perfect kind of makeup
essential for the summertime or holidays
you want to play it right now I feel
like who doesn't love fix+ it's one of
those like must-have products and if
your intellect the golden glow a vibe
like me you definitely have to get your
hands on this one since this is kind of
what it looks like in the bottle like I
am obsessed another spray I have been
loving
is definitely more for your body but
also your hair and is scented now this
isn't a new product this month but I've
definitely been reaching for a lot more
is the wire sell black opium dry oil for
body and hair now if you know the smell
of black Bochum is literally like such a
rich luxuriously indulging scent I love
love love the perfume it's really like
sexy matured dark dangerous kind of vibe
so imagine it in like a body oil that
you can like rub all over your body this
is literally like I love this stuff I
love it all of my chest legs didn't even
realize you could spray it in your hair
but now I'm going to honestly the smell
of this is just incredible and a body
oils really do kind of let linger on
your body I like things really just you
can rub it in but like it it's still
like stays you know I mean oil takes a
while to absorb not that that's a bad
thing but it just means like the scent
like it lasts forever like that's why I
love it I love this scent so much so if
you kind of want that to last on you all
night give you a gorgeous glow in your
skin this is amazing now next up are a
couple of more kind of like glowy body
products and the first one is from NARS
it is their bronzing a body oil like I
said I love oils I feel like they're
super nourishing on the skin and
especially a bronzing ones that are
going to give you that like gorgeous
color I'll pour a little bit on me and
show you what that looks like that's
just kind of like rub that in real quick
yes for the bronze and yes for oily
vibes I love that again same kind of
concept as the YSL one the YSL one just
adds a little bit of like a glow because
it's just oil but it's more the scent
that I'm obsessed with this I'm obsessed
with the kind of like a bronzing reflex
of it I want this one over mine
eggs especially this is like a summer
summer must have any bed need any of it
and it goes such a long way it's so
definitely get your hands on this if
you're into that kind of like summer
bronzing glow oily look if you're not so
much of a body oil fan but you still
want that glow
Melanie Mills has to be hands down some
of the best body gleaming cream she does
like so many different colors there's
one that I've got it's just the kind of
gold color it's called disco gold I am
obsessed with her bronzing ones they're
so so gorgeous I'll show you what the
gold one looks like like oh sweet baby
Jesus honestly I have been reaching for
these before I go out I am known for
just being always glittery always kind
of like shimmering and these just blend
amazingly I feel like they don't really
transfer too much the colors are insane
they're real like yellow gold or like
golden golds do you know I mean they're
not too like pink gold but pink bronze
have you know I mean when I say golden
golds actually I mean like golden bronze
like golden bronze color like all of
thee like ah just like every color you
could think of I think that perfect
perfect perfect for summer I feel you
can even mix a little bit until your
foundation or something like that and I
know that she does like a travel-size of
all maybe her best-selling runs or maybe
all of them I'm not sure if that's all
the colors that she does but there was
like five so we don't want to invest in
just kind of one big one she definitely
does a travel sized one which I feel
like is perfect for like traveling or on
holiday definitely definitely a some
essential I'm gonna be like bathing in
probably like a mixture of all those
products all summer long and finally
maybe what you've all been waiting for
or maybe not my new favorite nude
combination I'm obsessed with this so
one thing I like to do is to line my
lips and then go to lip liners that I
wear are kind of Mac Oak stripped down
spiceworld that kind of vibe so I lined
my lips with that and then I you
the kind of new it's not new it's old
but they bought it back lipstick from
Mac it is in the color Shrimpton now if
you have a lot of empty Mac products and
go back to Mac and ask for this lipstick
it is literally my go-to nude right now
it's kind of like honey love vibes mixed
with velvet teddy vibes but like that
color
in between I have been loving this so
much and I love to put on top is the
NARS lip gloss in sweet dreams
I love NARS lip glosses the a pewter
this is like my fav this color is so
perfect for summer let me like do a
little close-up
it's like rose gold vibes like rose gold
nude vibes the color doesn't translate
to to like thickly or sticky that's what
I love about these they are not sticky
at all they're so comfortable and this
just gives it's like a gorgeous lip top
but it's nothing too sparkly or too
light that is going to get rid of that
color it just adds such a gorgeous gold
shimmery shine it to your nude or like
basically any color that you want but on
to of this it just makes your lips look
so nude and we're not so nude but like
just so juicy and kissable
and that is always the vibe that I go
for and it's so comfortable I feel like
I could always keep reapplying it
without it like moving everywhere and
all sorts I know you guys are obsessed
with nude combinations like I am this
needs to go straight in your basket so
they are all my April favorites I hope
