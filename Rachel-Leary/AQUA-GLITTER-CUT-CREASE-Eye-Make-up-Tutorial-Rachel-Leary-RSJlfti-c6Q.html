asked you guys what you wanted to see
next and in my previous video it loads
of you said that you wanted something
really warm and fiery and then on
Twitter those of you said that you
wanted to make it super colorful so I
kind of combined it together and did
this kind of awkward glitter cut crease
and normally I stay away from blue ties
just because my eyes are blue and you
mix colors that are the same color as
your eye it kind of doesn't enhance them
it almost just kind of takes the
attention away so I paired it with
really intense complementary colors in
the crease to kind of bring it all
together so if you've got green eyes you
could totally switch out the out with
the green and then use purples in your
crease or something like that and you
kind of get the gist of what I mean yeah
and this is just an eye tutorial so I do
skip through skin and lips but I kept
the skin and lips as you can see it
really really super minimal so if you
like the look of this makeup look make
sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already birth
let's go into the tutorials
so starting off I'm priming my I using
the Urban Decay primer potion in Eden
just something really a flesh tone and
just buffing that all over my lid with a
synthetic brush you want to really prep
your eye and we are going to do the eyes
first because there's potential for
fallout and we want to clean up the
edges now because this is a eye tutorial
I thought I would include for once how I
do my eyebrows so I'm taking the medium
brown anastasia dipbrow from oh yeah
anastasia and i am just filling them in
kind of starting a quarter of the way in
where I'm the most sparse and using this
to kind of fill in as you can see my
eyebrows are actually quite short so I
do have to extend them which is why I
use kind of more of a darker color and I
use loads of little strokes just to kind
of fill them in and mimic the appearance
of brow hairs because I feel that's what
looks the most natural and I kind of
start from the bottom and work my way to
the top of the brow if that makes sense
then once I'm kind of happy with the
shape and the color intensity I then
kind of feather it lightly through and
then I take a lighter dip brow this is a
blonde and use that through the front of
my brow just because everyone's eyebrow
has a natural gradient weds it goes from
light to dark and then I just brush that
through they're kind of fun and then I
turn my brush to the side and go upwards
because everyone's hairs also naturally
go upwards at the front so like I said
that's just kind of the way I find it
looks the most natural now onto the eye
makeup I am taking chickadee from makeup
geek we are going to be using mostly
makeup geek eyeshadows today just
because I love the colors and they're
definitely a lot more accessible these
days so I'm just going in with a fluffy
brush and I find it easy when doing a
cut crease to look down into a mirror so
I can really see my socket and just kind
of concentrate this color in my crease
and taking it quite high up because we
want a gradient effect and we're gonna
be applying a few other crease colors as
well the next one we're gonna be taking
is puppy also from makeup geek on the
same fluffy brush concentrating this in
the same kind of place but not taking it
as high up into the socket just because
like I said we want to create that
gradient so we still want to be able to
see that chickadee color but then also
it kind of
and into this more intense fiery orange
and then just going back and I think I
picked up a bit more chickadee just to
kind of blend it out and soften it then
going in with poppy from makeup geek on
a smaller fluffy brush I'm using this to
really define the crease this is why we
always do eye makeup first as you can
see I had a bit of fallout and this way
we can always clean it up and then I'm
going in with Coco bear from makeup geek
as well but first just blending the
crease to make sure everything is really
seamless and smoky and it all like I
said blend is a blended and diffused
together but then yep going in aware
that Coco bear which is a really dark
warm at Brown taking a pencil brush and
this is what we're really gonna start to
kind of cut the crease you want it to be
a harsh line at first but then we are as
always gonna blend it out because we
don't want no harsh lines just yet
anyways to really carve out our crease
I'm taking this white rabbit gel liner
from Oprah and using a synthetic brush
and using this essentially as an
eyeshadow base cuz I'm going in with a
bright turquoise on the lid using a
white underneath it's gonna really make
that color pop and because this is a
cream also you can like you can see use
it to clean up any mess that you had on
your lid and really carve out your
crease
then taking the color aqua this is from
the mayor Mayor palette from Anastasia
but they do sell it individually I'm
just taking it on a synthetic flat brush
and just pressing it onto essentially
where we just placed all the white of
see if you're not using aqua this is
just where you would place your lid to
color and yeah just pressing it on and
making sure it is super intense and
applying more if it needs to be to get
the color intensity that you want then
taking it deep Brown from the same
palette they also do this individually
on angle brush using this to really cut
and carve out the crease
then on the pencil brush that we use to
apply Coco bear just going in and using
that do a buff out there's a crease kind
of harsh line but still keeping it
visible just because like I said this is
a crease a cut crease tutorial so you do
want the crease to kind of be harsh but
all the colors above it to be really
soft and blended
now for glitter this is Mac reflex
transparent teal it's quite a subtle
glitter but as you can see I'm just I
just braid my brush with fix+ when it
has the product on it and then just
pressing that on top of the Aqua
eyeshadow now I'm just taking a makeup
wipe and cleaning up all of the mess and
really creating that wing this is why I
love doing my eye makeup first because
it looks kind of crappy at the crease
and then you wipe it all the way and bam
now I'm using the NYC liquid liner to
create a wing eye I'm gonna do an
eyeliner tutorial next week so stay
tuned for that and apply lashes these
are House of lashes ikonics I love them
all so you can just leave it with
mascara but you know I'm obsessed and
then I just went ahead and did my face
makeup but because this is an eye
tutorial I'm just gonna skip through
that I have loads of tutorials with the
same kind of skin but I'm just going in
with the Makeup Forever aqua excel
pencil in the shut from the shower in
the color m26 in the waterline to match
the lid and then going in with Monaco
eyeshadow to choose a buff that out
underneath basically mimicking what we
did on the top along the bottom and I
love the way how this turned out then
just went ahead and applied a bottom
lash mascara and that is the finished
eye look I really hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial give it a thumbs up if you
did and subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in the next one bye
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
