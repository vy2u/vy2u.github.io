doing another inspired look this one is
the Ariana Grande side-to-side music
video and it is a hair and makeup
tutorial when I saw the video I was
obsessed with her pink eyeshadow look
it's kind of the one where yeah like her
hair's all like this I just think she
looks incredible it was like a pink
glittery winged out kind of smoky eye
and quite like a brown tone nude lip so
again quite different for me but yeah I
absolutely love how this came out and I
love the makeup that she was wearing she
looked incredible in the video so make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you like
look at this makeup and hair tutorial
and yeah so let's go ahead and get
started
okay so starting off completely at fresh
face I'm gonna get my hair way because
we will do that after and we are going
to go straight on to the eyes to prime
our eyes we're going to use the Mac
painterly paint-pot
and then going in with this Too Faced
bonbon chop chocolate bonbon palette and
taking this light brown color to start
off our kind of transition from light to
dark you guys know the drill I'm using
my Mac two to four it's become my
all-time favorite and the short kind of
transition color blending brush as well
as obviously my Sigma e-40 but yes I am
just blending that into my socket going
in with this color here called maca to
further deepen up the crease on a
slightly smaller crease brush I believe
that this is a Mac or maybe it's Sigma
I'm not sure either one of those
probably an e25 from sigma and just yeah
blending that into the crease and
applying as much of the product as you
want to build up the color intensity
that you want it was definitely a pink
focus on the lid and I didn't really get
a good enough picture to see what kind
of crease colors she was going with but
the Too Faced BAAAM BAAAM palette that
pink shade that's in its called to me so
I'm just using the colors that are in
there and then I'm mixing these two
purple shades from the morphe 35 B
palette because she definitely had a
really dark purple crease going on so
I'm taking an even smaller crease brush
and just taking that from inner corner
to outer caller caller corner and making
sure it is blended seamlessly by going
back in with the brushes that we used
previously
it was this color that inspired me to do
this whole look this is from the
two-faced bonbon palette like I said and
it's this pink shade and I'm just
pressing that all over the lid it wasn't
as pigmented as I wanted it to be so I
did have to dip my brush in a few times
but I think if you probably use mac fix+
you would have got a lot more pigment
from it but just pressing that all over
the lid and obviously building up the
color intensity that you want and then
going back in with those two purple
colors again just blending the crease
and the lid shades together so it's all
one big fat gradient across your eye her
crease didn't look too intense I'm just
taking this dark brown from the same
palette on a fruity small defined fluffy
crease brush and yet just concentrating
on the outer part of our eye and kind of
taking it into the purple shades you
guys know just blendy blendy blendy you
can see I'm mixing up all the brushes
again just to make sure it's all
seamless now it's time for the glitter
yazz taking the two-faced glitter glue
and I'm just pressing that on it to the
lid or kind of just basically where I
want the glitter to go and then I'm
taking the Sigma bewitched glitter which
I'm pretty sure is out of stock or
discontinued but Mac reflex pink is
exactly the same as this so I will leave
that link down below if you want to get
that instead I'm just pressing that on
top of the glue I'm obsessed and then
I'm going back in with the brush that we
used to apply the lid color just to make
sure that the pink still shines through
and everything is blended for the inner
corner highlight I'm taking this really
a light iridescent pink and mixing it
with the highlight shade and yeah just
pressing that into my inner corner as
intensely as I wanted it to be I also
took that on my brow bone as well this
is my favorite part you guys know I'm
just cleaning up the mess underneath my
eye and creating that sharp sharp wing
to also give us a really good base for
when we do liquid eyeliner speaking of
which I'm taking the ico flat liquid
eyeliner pen and applying these Ardell
double whispies and I did put
individuals on the end to make them a
bit more winged out I couldn't tell she
was wearing false lashes and if she did
that was super wispy and natural so
these are perfect for that she had
really dark and defined brows as well so
I'm obviously going to be using my
anastasia dipbrow in medium brown for
that
now onto the skin I'm using in the next
angel veil I never known anyone to be so
excited for skin I'm using the NYX angel
veil a primer and just buffing that all
over my skin to make sure we have a
really nice base I used to think this
was really like illuminating but it's
actually not it's more sort of smoothing
but it does have a slightly do a finish
to it the foundation I'm using the Mac
Studio Fix fluid I've noticed her makeup
artist uses a lot of Mac and she
obviously is a Viva Glam ambassador for
Mac so I just took a guess and assumed
she might use this foundation because
her skin looked super flawless and quite
full coverage so speaking of that we are
going in with the a Maybelline
okay about a mind blank the Maybelline
Lumi touch magic concealer pen something
like that basically it has a really cool
brush and I love it for defining the
winged liner because it allows you to
get super close and then I went a bit
extra and kind of define my eyebrows as
well and I literally and never do that
didn't notice much of a difference but I
kind of liked it but I'm then just
blending it out with my Beauty Blender
as always because I feel like I put
quite a lot on but I did want it to be
quite bright and full coverage so this
is just going to absorb any of the
excess product you guys know I've
explained the way a Beauty Blender works
many time and that is why it is
brilliant to set underneath my eyes and
bake with I'm not just using my RCM a
powder this time but oh my god there's a
tiny Real Techniques sponge made this so
so easy I'm obsessed with this now like
I'm never going to use a brush again
that this sponge is so so cute and it
allows me to get super super close and
it be really comfortable as well but
yeah I mixed my RC ma no color powder
with the bare minerals well rested
powder which i think is actually a
powder concealer so this gave me maximum
coverage and really really brightened up
underneath my eyes as you can see
I swear this is literally like airbrush
in a powder it's magic but it didn't
look like she had lots going on
underneath her eye so I just took the
lightest transition color and applied
mascara and that is the eyes finished I
never like to just leave the under eye
completely bare I think it looks nice
when you tie all together so using a
really light color worked well for there
but bronzer I'm taking the Mac care
blends look the studio care blend powder
in dark on a duo fiber brush and just
using that term bronze and kind of
define my cheekbones and everything a
bit more not necessary to contour with
because it's quite a warm product but
just placing it in other places that
Officer want to reduce and look I
literally just went from pale to like a
bronze gada
oh my god I just no no not a bronze
goddess just looking super bronze
speaking of which I'm taking the NARS
luster blusher cuz she never really
wears anything noticeably pink on her
cheeks I find and this one is just a
really really nice at bronze rose gold
color and has a bit of shimmer the
tiniest flush of pink so I thought it
was perfect this look for the highlight
I am at taking the one from the
chocolate bar bonbon oh my god I can't
talk today from the bonbon palette and
just applying that to the tops of my
cheekbones it was such a nice formula
I'm not even sure is this an eyeshadow
or is it a face highlight but whatever
is I really really like it I'm just
taking this morphe brush and just a
placement on the tops of my cheekbones
and my nose and on my Cupid's bow as
well I swear this voiceover I've
actually just chatted like the most
random stuff ever
anyway it's peaking over oh my god noise
and speaking of onto the lips I'm lining
them with Spice from Mac and then
applying this over a liquid lipstick in
Bellaire and you can use the code
Rachael Larry for 30% off I believe all
my discount codes are always in the
description down below but yeah just
apply that onto my lip she's definitely
had more of a brown warmer tone nude
going on so this color is perfect and
I'm obsessed with how it came out it
looks like a proper Kylie Jenner lip if
I do say so myself
anyone else find that weirdly satisfying
to watch anyways on to gloss I'm
applying this Kiko super dazzle gloss
it's either in 1 month 3 or 1 month 2 I
got remember but I've definitely linked
it down below along with all the other
products that I've used and that is the
finished makeup look like I said I'm
obsessed with the way this came out pink
glitter and me a just meant to be and I
love her glossy nude lip as you know now
onto the hair I'm just taking it to
front bits this is kind of like the
shortest layer of my hair so you guys
have layers in your hair just take two
of the shortest layers at the front and
then I kind of pinned them together so
they weren't in the way or like flapping
about or distracting me and then with my
hair brush I'm just taking it back all
my hair kind of from the above my ear
and back but in like a half up half down
so not like my whole head just the kind
of top half of my hair that makes sense
you can kind of see what I'm doing from
the video and then just brushing it back
and then with all of that taking the
middle part of that section and bringing
it forward because we're going to give
that bit serious volume but yeah just
tying that one back in a ponytail so
it's out the way and not distracting us
yeah like I said with that bit that we
just pulled forward we're gonna really a
backcomb it and then I'm taking this
Bardot like dry shampoo to give it loads
of noise and volume because Harry had so
much volume in her hair and just praying
that at the roots and then kind of
letting it fall down and then I'm
molding it to the top of my head
definitely make sure you've background
it enough so it stays upright and then I
am just pinning it back on top of the
ponytail that we kind of tied back with
that makes sense so you've got a little
quiff going on
super easy and it's super put together
but she definitely had a bit of a curl
to her hair so I'm just taking up my
Bellamy at 6 in-1 curling wand and the
largest barrel and just kind of holding
them for like a really short amount of
time because there weren't really tight
curls they were quite loose and it beat
you which is my absolute favorite and
then at the front I'm only really
concentrating the curl at the bottom of
the hair if that makes sense
because they weren't ringlets they were
just kind of had a little curl at that
end and yet then I'm going back in with
the dry shampoo that I used earlier to
give it lots and lots of extra volume
and then I'm going in with the Bardot
finishing spray as kind of like to give
my hair a bit of shine and to make sure
everything is locked in place I'm
obsessed this hair literally is so so so
easy but looks really formal and put
together which is definitely why I
wanted to include it so that is the
finished look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it make sure to give it a thumbs
up if you did like I say always
I love inspired looks so let me know in
the comments down below any one's
anything else that you want to see and
I'll see you in the next one
