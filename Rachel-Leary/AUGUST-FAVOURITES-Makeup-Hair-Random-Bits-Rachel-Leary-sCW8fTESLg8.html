today i am bringing you my August
favorites which is basically a bunch of
stuff that I have been loving over the
past month I know I'm a little bit late
with this as well a couple weeks into
September now but I thought I'd get up
anyway because loads of you always asked
my favorite products at the moment and
stuff that I've been loving so I thought
I would do a kind of run up of makeup
there's a bit of hair and then there's
just like random lip in there as well I
feel like this time of year it's quite a
popular time for people's birthdays I
know it's someone's birthday every day
but like loads of people I know suddenly
it's suddenly their birthday so there
might be some gift ideas in here and
some of them are quite new releases that
have become like instant favorites for
me so get them while you can
so go ahead and get started with makeup
obviously that's why I have the monster
now the first one I think people gonna
be a little bit annoyed but just because
you can't get your hands on it anymore
but it is the Kylie popping floss out
she kept tweeting saying that it was
still in stock and I was very surprised
I really thought this would sell out
really quickly but I am in love with
this it's like a golden nut gloss it's
really really pigmented smells just like
her liquid lipsticks which if you
haven't tried they're like a vanilla
scented so it smells so so so good I am
in love with this to go on top of a bit
more like pinky nudes just because this
makes it a lot more like a brownie new
because it's like as gold color and not
to mention if the name that suggests it
literally makes your lips pop I love it
when your lips just flip really juicy
and full and this defo makes your lips
it like that I actually might put this
on now why literally obsessed with this
I know there's loads of companies that
do like metallic finish glosses like the
L'Oreal gloss in disco ball it's really
similar
like the skinny dip lip topper from
jouer that kind of thing this is
definitely more of a gloss those ones
are a bit more creamy but yeah if you've
got your hands in this you know
is gorgeous I'm in love with it and
Sephora do a really similar one as well
and I did put it in my snapchat not too
long ago if I remember the name I'll
write it down below so this is a
relatively a new one for me and it is
what I was wearing underneath the poppin
bus that I just put on and it's a
perfect example of a pinky nude that I
love to put like a brown or gloss on the
top and it is the jouer matte lip cream
in buff it was one of their full
releases I think it was literally came
out not that long ago I am obsessed with
light-colored nudes and this is
definitely one of my new favorites it
looks like this and I'm obsessed with it
me and I bought one for Han as well
because I was licking on the copy
website and I was like girl I'm getting
this you need it - thank you so much but
yeah I'm always on the hunt for like a
light-colored nudes and the formula of
these I've not tried they're kind of
just solid color lip creams
I tried their metallic ones I've got
like the papaya one and like I said the
skinny dip one these go on so so so
nicely it's so creamy and they dry
really really quick I normally like I
said put a gloss on the top especially
this one cuz me it's quite pink on its
own so I do like to put a bit more of a
Goldy nude gloss on the top I've not
worn it on its own to test the longevity
but when there's a gloss on the top it
does kind of wear off a little bit
quicker but obviously that's just due to
the gloss forget if you like a matte lip
these ones are so comfortable they go on
so - so easy and they have a really
really good color Rangers well when I
was buying that I also bought this as
well from cult beauty it is the Jaclyn
hill and Becca split pan highlighter I'm
I got the email actually Hannah text me
to be fair but I got the email as well
to say that these were available on cult
beauty and I was straight on it I wasn't
even gonna wait a single second as soon
as I got the email it was already in my
basket so the one I picked up was the
Prosecco pop and amaretto one which
looks like this so a bit more of the
nudie colored blush and I already have
champagne pop so I definitely wanted to
make sure that I picked up one that had
Prosecco pop so I could try that as well
and I'm gonna swatch these for you guys
now so you can see them there that one
is pre-soak
and that is the blusher I'm not a
massive blusher wearer so colors like
this really really scream to me they're
just slightly pinky and have a really
nice warm tone to it so I'm obsessed I
have absolutely no idea the stock of
these I was talking to someone at Court
beauty and I'm pretty sure she said that
they were all gone the last time I
checked but definitely add yourself to
the wish list I do this all the time
with products on their site because
they're one of the only decent UK sites
that stocks products that we want like
this hard to get hold of so definitely
add yourself to the wish list and they
add it into your basket straight away
for you as soon as it comes back in
stock so it's super super handy if you
get the chance definitely pick this up
especially if you're not a massive
blusher wear this color blush is
stunning something else I picked up not
too long ago that I have on my face
today as well that's become a favorite
of mine I definitely want to get in a
slightly lighter color as well is the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation this
is so full coverage and you barely need
a drop it literally you have to work
quite quickly with it as well but it
literally it feels like a velvet on your
skin it bolides across and I can't even
explain the coverage is phenomenal so
many of you guys compliment me on my
skin and most of the time I am wearing
this because it's quite an expensive
foundation I don't like to wear it too
often but it is my go-to for a night out
I of the color honey deep which is quite
dark it is far like an NC 42 in like a
matte foundation if you know what that
is so yeah it is quite dark both the I
balanced out with like a much lighter
concealer and blend it down into my turn
and stuff so it does work for me like I
said this is not for the faint-hearted
like this is full coverage is the
remarkable full coverage foundation I
really thought this gonna last me a long
time it so I feel like it was definitely
worth the money because like I said you
barely need any of it lid comes off like
this and then there is an applicator
like that that you just kind of like
swipe across your face and yeah I let
you need one swipe one swipe it does my
whole face and I'm obsessed like I think
how many times can I say obsessed but
like I said this is a favorites video
and this is defo defo a favorite and I
picked mine up a Sephora when I was in
my bear I think if you're in the UK you
can get this from Harrods I'm not sure
that Selfridges yeah I don't think so
but definitely Harrods or you can order
online on Sephora but I'll link it down
below something else I've been loving
recently is the Maybelline strobe stick
in nude blow I am obsessed with putting
a cream highlighter down before a powder
I think it just really adds an extra to
your highlight mix it really really
stand out and it gives it a good face
and makes it last a lot longer this one
is so so so nice it's obviously surf
horrible it's from Maybelline I just
really love the color
sometimes a cream highlight just like so
they can be too pearly or too pink this
one is such a gorgeous golden color and
I'll swatch of it on my hand for you so
it looks like this and it is kind of
coming up a bit more like a baby than it
actually is but it's a really gorgeous
golden color I would definitely like
Prosecco pop on the top of that to
really intensify my highlight and make
it last longer like I said and it's not
too like spot you're intense either it's
called a strobing stick and that's
exactly what it does it really gives a
nice strobing effect I've been using
this a lot while I was away in New York
obviously and yeah I really really like
the cream one if you haven't tried to
already definitely pick this up they
might do other colours as well like
maybe there might be a bit more of a
pearly pink one but this one in is
called medium nude glow is my favorite
the last actual makeup P bit is from a
benefit and it is their 3d browser
they've ever been it is that 3d of brow
tines in the number two I've been really
loving using a lighter brown tone
through my brows because I have quite a
few different colors in my hair like
obviously I have a bit like a ombre
going on it goes from dark to light but
I quite like my eyebrows to be dark here
and lighter at the front brushing this
through them it just kind of ties it all
together dark bits of my eyebrows it
gives them a bit of like it gives them a
bit of blondness and just kind of ties
it all together and it sets them all in
place so that applicator looks like this
so you have a really kind of thin bit at
the front which I use it the front of my
eyebrows now I like to brush it through
it has a slightly metallic finish to it
hence why it's called 3d brow turns it's
just meant to make them appear a lot
fuller and when the light hits them yeah
like I said me
in the para bit fuller yeah I've been
really loving this as a replacement as a
good clear brow gel just adds a bit of
color and adds a bit more dimension to
my eyebrows and the last make up a bit
is actually a sponge it is the mini Real
Techniques sponge I'm obsessed with the
bigger orange one I think it's such a
good dupe for the Beauty Blender and
obviously it's like super super
affordable my sister gave me this
because she she wasn't really getting
along with it and I said have you tried
using it for powder and that's what I
use it for this is like my little baking
companion I just dip it in my powder and
I press it underneath and it literally
just brightens up my under-eye you know
what it is it's super obviously because
it's a sponge it makes it really really
comfortable and it's really really small
so I can be really really precise with
it and it's perfect at traveling instead
of bringing like a brush my under eye
this does the job just as well or even
better than a brush but I do use a brush
to wipe it away so you know but I
already really loved this and obviously
it's not breaking the bank
it's from boots and Superdrug and the
Real Techniques sponges and brushes in
general are cruelty free and amazing so
love this little buddy so the next few
things I'm going to show you are like
hair favorites that I've been loving
recently two of them are from Bordeaux
they are a kind of Express boutique for
hair and makeup you can find them in
London or Marbella and I think there's
another location but I can't actually
remember they were kind enough to invite
me to have a complimentary blow-dry not
too long ago and they gifted me with
some of their products and I've been
obsessive them one of them is a dry
shampoo and can we just talk about this
packaging it is so sleek it's like black
and gold but yeah this stuff is like
keratin and rich and it helps like
strengthen and restore dry hair and
obviously as it's a dry shampoo it's
perfect for getting we did grease on the
go I also find this adds loads of volume
to my hair as well and it smells just
like a salon and I love it when your
hair smells like I said I just feel like
pampered all day but yeah I've been
obsessed with this dry shampoo and the
other thing is a finishing mist so this
just kind of adds a bit of shine to your
hair obviously a bit like a hairspray as
well again if this is keratin
rich and it helps to protect your hair
from heat and humidity and that is why I
love it so much because at the moment it
is so so so humid and my hair isn't
actually a really really frizzy so this
just helps to control it especially on a
night out if I've called my hat or
straightened it by the end of it usually
my hair just it's like really expanded
so this really helps to just keep it in
place and keep it looking how I wanted
to all evening and the last hair product
I've had for ages and I've never really
mentioned it before but at the moment my
has just been feeling so so so dry so
I've been really reaching for this and
this is the least 1/3 Coco look or like
coconut spray it is basically it says it
looks like milk acts like oil silk just
draw an injection of moisture to bring a
hair back to life
you essentially spray this into tower
dry hair and then just let your hair dry
it smells phenomenal his coconut range
is my absolute favorite that is the
scent for my hair like I like just my
body just my like sweets and candy and
stuff sometimes I like a bit of fresh
thing as you'll see in a second but I
love my hair to smell like coconuts
I just love to lie down and be able to
smell coconut it takes me to like
holiday or something I'm that's just the
scent of my hair and I've been really
really loving this at the moment I
literally drench my hair in it
it smells amazing and it just gives my
hair a lot more moisture because my hair
being blonde can get really really
really dry so I do concentrate there's
mainly on the ends of my hair I do go
crazy and spray it everywhere and I've
been really loving this at the moment
and the Lee Stafford range is really
really affordable you can get it in
Boots superdrug stuff like that and I
definitely recommend this and their
shampoo and conditioner and the hair
mask like this whole range in general is
a favorite autism random bits now I have
a perfume the agent another speaker the
path you might actually been loving at
the moment is this one it is from a
father and I got sent this ages ago
and initially because it's not super
super sweet or like a candy I didn't
like dismiss it but I just didn't reach
for often but when my friends came
around and like I have all my / friends
out on display and they got this
and sprayed it they absolutely loved it
I didn't really take much notice until
recently when I couldn't like find my
usual perfumes that I use so I sprayed
this one I don't really know how to
describe it literally smells it smells
really fresh it's still got a sweet
element to it it just smells clean and
really sophisticated and I've been
really really reaching for this at the
moment it really wings to your skin as
well I know every perfume smells
different on everyone but I've been
really loving this it's so hard to
describe sense if you've tried it let me
know how you would describe it like in
the comments below
yeah I just always find I put my clothes
back on after I've sprayed this it's it
smells even better I feel like it's a
person that just gets better throughout
the day and if you don't like things
that are too sweet but have a bit of a
sweet sweet edge fresh scent and you
should definitely give yourself a spritz
of this if you stumble across it so the
next favorite is a deodorant it's
actually a men's deodorant this smells
like that classic boys smelling I think
a lot of girls like this smell when they
hug a boy and I realize that's not on me
too and maybe not necessarily in a
fragrance but in a deodorant and I this
is super strong as well I think of
Seekers men supposedly sweats a lot more
than girls this is super long-lasting it
claims to be 48-hour wear and I love
this running troubling and just
generally in this hot weather
keeps me smelling nice like this boys
smell lingering around me I don't see
it's my deodorant just super random I
don't use other ones sometimes but I've
been really loving this one at the
moment my friend of media this is
actually this was my friend of medias
and she was gonna leave it at our hotel
nothing no I've been really loving using
this app holiday I'll take it back with
me and yeah I've been using it ever
since and it's got like a cooling effect
as well so when you're really hot this
is just like the best thing ever and my
final favorite is this it is a GB is it
No
a JBL speaker I treat myself to this
because I don't actually have a speaker
and I'm always just sitting in my room
with my headphones I can never hear when
my parents are calling me or anything
like that but I love love
listening to music just constantly all
the time and I got it in red I
definitely know that they do other
colors as well I thought red looked kind
of cool this is such a good speaker a
little bit of an investment it's like a
hundred and something pounds but I
didn't want to get some sort of you know
you can get people like these people
that claim the speaker's got so much
face and it's only like 30 pounds and
then you play it and the batteries crap
like the bass isn't what you said and
it's just crap but yeah so I've been
absolutely loving this I constantly have
it on while I'm doing my makeup and just
where my friends around we're getting
ready and stuff is it goes so soul as
the bass is incredible and it was such a
good investment the battery life on this
lofts amazingly as well and I always
take it with me to one I'm in the
bathroom and I obviously place across
the room but like when I'm in the shower
I love listening to music I always eat
take this with me it's also a charge of
buying it is bluetooth so you don't need
a cable or anything like that and yeah I
have been loving this so that is it for
