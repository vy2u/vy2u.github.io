today I am bringing you a back-to-school
inspired makeup look something really
simple and easy to create as well as
being super affordable I'm using all
products from the drugstore or either
from either like me like super job and
boots so really easy to get your hands
on if you want to learn how to create
this makeup list then please keep
watching the first thing you're gonna be
doing is priming my face and this is the
L'Oreal Lumi magique primer just putting
a pump of that one to my skin you've
gotta know that the same
next up I'm going to be using the
Bourjois healthy mix serum foundation
and applying it with a zoeva 104 buffer
brush so you can do a couple of chumps
of this onto the back of my hand and
then rub it into the skin
I like this foundation because it's a
medium to buildable coverage so it's
fitting that you can still see your skin
underneath it which is good fiscal you
don't want to be too caked in makeup
next is eyebrows I'm going to be using
the for our archery and hot chocolates
and soap and glory and the Loreal brow
artist plumper you can use one or the
other or whatever you have this is just
the stuff I like to use at the moment
and I'm just going to be filling them in
as usual I do have a brow tutorial on
this and I can think I'm down below this
is a new product for me I'm going to be
trying out but sometimes I find it's
helped to just set them in place so they
last a bit longer
but it's nothing
I can push it back push it back down
if you want me to
we can
yeah
so tell me
was left to lose their fear
next is eyeshadow and I'm going to be
priming my eyes using this NYX eyeshadow
base
next I'm using the nudes palette by
Maybelline and taking this shade here on
a pencil brush I'm just highlighting my
inner corner and my brow bone
on a sigma e40 fluffy crease brush I am
taking this shade here and just lightly
buffing it into the crease
then I am taking this pigment or dazzle
dust by bury em in the shade can't
really tell I think it's shade 39 but
it's basically just a light champagne
shade and just applying that all over
the lid
like so and you could just leave it
there if you wanted to but I'm gonna add
a bit more kind of drama just because if
it's for your first day back you know
make an impression
so I'm next taking this dark brown
shimmery shade through the same palette
I'm just using that to deepen up the
crease so taking it over the ridge as
well then going back in with my Sigma
brush to just soften up the edges
now normally this would be where I
personally would apply liquid eyeliner
but I wanted to do something different
just because I know not everyone can do
liquid eyeliner and some schools may not
let you wear lip liner but I wanted to
create something a little bit softer so
I'm taking a pointed pencil brush this
is the zoeva pencil brush number 230 and
just mixing this matte brown and black
shape and the same Maybelline palette on
the end of my brush and just pressing it
against the lash line like so
like that then creating a really tiny
wing which is quite it makes it easier
when you've got a pointed brush to do
this and don't worry if it's not perfect
because we can always clean up with
concealer afterwards so I'm just
extending it towards the end of my brow
and then I'm bringing it back in
like so it just kind of creates a softer
look next ah this is totally optional I
just have very straight eyelashes that
I'm going to be curling them just using
any eyelash curlers these are the half
eyelash curlers from Mac just because
area and I am applying the Rimmel wake
me up mascara and that's the eye makeup
basically done back onto the face I'm
going to be using the Rimmel wake me up
concealer under my eyes this is in the
shade true ivory just around my nose I'm
also gonna use this to tidy up my eye
shadow slightly so the same on this side
I'm gonna buff that in using my Sigma
soft blend concealer brush number f/64
to set that all in place aren't going to
be using the rimmel clear complexion
powder and this is in the shade
translucent just to set the concealer
and the rest of my face I'm going to be
using a zoeva luxe cheek finish brush to
do so to finish off my eyes I'm used to
going back into the Maybelline palette
and taking this color here and just
running it underneath my eyes
finish off my face i'm using the
maybelline master sculpt and i'm going
to use the bronzer and the highlighter
from next and i think this is the shade
like comedian so I'm just taking this
shade here on a zoeva luxe faced 109
then on a real techniques setting brush
just taking the highlight shape a bit of
color on the cheeks I am going to be
taking luminoso by Milani on the same
brush that we used to apply the powder
now for the lips just something quick
and easy I am taking this this
Maybelline lipstick in the shade it for
to Rosewood pal which is basically just
like a clear wearable nude shade then
applying this strawberry lip balm from
the body shop on the top
so this is the finished look I hope you
guys like it something um obviously a
lot more simple then that you're
probably used to seeing on my channel
but since it's back-to-school you don't
want to go over the top but you just
want something that's gonna be
relatively simple but wearable at the
same time I hope you guys liked this
