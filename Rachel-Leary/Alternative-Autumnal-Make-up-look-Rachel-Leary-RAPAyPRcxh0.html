today a little bit of like a different
lip option for me but that's the whole
point of this video today I wanted to
film kind of like an alternative or
tunnel makeup lip so I've kind of stuck
with warm eyes but I went with kind of a
kablooie grade lip or until he makes
blue stand out so I definitely wanted to
keep it quite warm on the eyes but do
let me know if you want to see like more
cool toned lips and stuff it's all very
matte on the eyes as well we don't use
too eyeshadows so it's super super easy
to create as well and I'm really
actually loving this lip it I feel like
it makes my eyes look even blew out so
yeah give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and let's get started oh and
before else and before you guys asked
this like alternative a bondage e-type
choker is from regal rose and it is part
of their new upcoming Halloween
collection I'm not sure if it's come out
yeah but definitely keep your eye out
for it
I was feeling a full-coverage glam stays
we've got to make sure us Skynyrd's prep
so I'm using the tap check Julia's
skinless just to really hydrate my skin
so we can prepare for like a lot of
foundation and for primer I'm using the
pur cosmetics correcting primer and this
is more of like a hydrating finish so it
feels really moisturizing on the skin as
well so just prepping our skin for the
anastasia beverly hills foundation stick
in the shade golden day has sent this to
me in this color and i also picked it up
myself so don't tell me it's not the
right color because it matches the color
of my tan and i'm just applying that
straight to my skin and then I'm going
in with a flat top kabuki brush and just
blending it that out then I'm just doing
my brows and so many of you have asked
for a brow routine so I'm definitely
gonna film that one for you and this is
what they look like and I've been really
into sculpting out my brows at the
moment so I'm going into the Anastasia
Beverly Hills concealer in a 1.5 and
just yes sculpting up my brows kind of
concentrating mainly the product under
the arch of my brow and then blending it
downwards to prime our eyes I'm using
the Maybelline Color tattoo in creme de
nude and just blending that all over my
lid space and up into the concealer so
it all blends out together and then once
I've applied the cream to both my eyes I
am just going to go ahead and set them
with powder so we are ready for eyes
shadow speaking of which I'm going in
with the makeup by Mario master palette
by Anastasia Beverly Hills and taking
the shade Isabel and blending that into
my crease as our initial transition
color I'm then taking a clean fluffy
brush and just making sure that the
edges of the eyeshadow are blended
seamlessly into can effect the concealer
so it's not anything harsh then I mix in
the shade it's a belt together with the
brown shade I can't remember the name of
it off the top of my head on a slightly
a more smaller defined fluffy brush just
to further deepen up the socket these
are literally the only two eyeshadows
were going to be using for the whole
look so it's a super super easy to
create and then once again it going back
in with that fluffy brush to make sure
everything is blended together taking
the shade Isabelle I'm using that as the
lid color as well and just packing that
on it doesn't matter so much because
we're using Walmart colors if it has a
little bit of fallout just because
they're so so so much easier to get rid
of instead of like the blacks or cool
tone colors and because they're matte as
well it's not going to leave any shimmer
and then just going back in with that
smaller definer brush and a little bit
more of that brown shade just to make
sure everything is blended together then
I'm using the shade 5th Avenue as my
inner corner highlight also technically
we're using three eyeshadows but I meant
just kind of like you know on the lid
and the crease and then i'm using the
illamasqua precision gel liner and I had
such trouble struggle filming this so I
just went ahead and did that off-camera
then we are just prepping our eyes for
false lashes and these are the escrito
lashes in the style Stefanie I'm
obsessed they are so so so fluttery and
it's kind of natural still and I have a
discount code below then I'm using at
the Attar is it the shape tape concealer
and I recently just got this and I love
it and then I am using what is left kind
of on me under eye just to clean up my
liner as well make it super super sharp
and then just blending it all out with a
Beauty Blender and I use the shade
light/medium for my concealer I list all
the shades and the products down below
so don't forget to check that out then
for contour I'm taking the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour stick in the color
mink and just applying that to my
cheekbones because it's really cool tone
I'm not gonna apply it everywhere just
because I only really wanted to contour
my nose and cheekbones but yeah I'm just
applying that directly and then it using
a duo fiber brush on my cheeks to blend
that out and then a a slightly smaller
duo fiber brush to blend out my nose
contour
once we've applied all creams to our
face i'm going in with the laura mercier
translucent setting powder just to bake
underneath my eyes and then use it the
excess just to kind of set the rest of
my face this is just going to ensure
that there's no creasing and our makeup
is kind of locked in and isn't gonna go
anywhere for the rest of the day these
loose translucent setting powders are
amazing as well if you have oily skin
for bronzer I'm going in with a cargo
cosmetics bronzer bronzer in the shade
medium on my favorite Mac brush and just
applying it lightly over the places that
we contoured as well as on my forehead
and kind of on my neck area because this
is just gonna warm up our skin where the
kind of I didn't apply the contour for
blush I'm at taking the laura geller
baked blush in the shade at tropic hues
just to kind of tie it in it with the
eyes as this has a really nice Orange II
warm tone to it so it's gonna really
complement the eyes and the lips as well
I felt like being quite extra is my
highlighter today so we're taking two
products this is a strobing Carter from
peaches makeup in the shade halo and I'm
just going to lightly apply that to the
tops of my cheekbones as well as just
above my brow and my nose and my Cupid's
bow this was slightly more of a pink
undertone and I did kind of want to add
a bit more warmth but it gave a good
base for the next product and this is
the 24 karat gold dust in the shade gold
by Jane Iredale and oh my god I love
this highlighter it is a loose powder so
it can be a super super intense if you
spray it with like fix+ but I did kind
of just pack it onto my skin and then
blend it in or like buff it into my skin
and I find it that way it applies a lot
better then back off to finish the eyes
I'm taking that initial color that we
used I think it's the color Isabel just
on a pencil brush and really it's
smoking out underneath my lower lash
line and also connecting it back into
the crease colors and the liner so
everything kind of joins together
then I just applied button lash mascara
and then I decided to go in black on my
waterline this is from zueva it's their
soft Kohl in the color noir obviously
you can use whatever black pencil you
want and then these are the finished
eyes so something actually really quite
easy but I feel like it makes a lot of
impact now on to the lip obviously
whatever lip color you want I felt like
being kind of alternative and I went
with this bluey gray color to complement
the warm tones on the eyes and also it
really brought out the color of my eyes
so if you have blue eyes I definitely
recommend it trying this out if you want
kind of like a different color lipstick
but that is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you did
