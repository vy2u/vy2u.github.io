done a track team video in this kind of
background yet and normally I like I
said I was going to do my charity of
videos in my bedroom but at the moment
I'm having a massive it clear out so I
kind of just wanted to obviously get a
video of you guys so I thought I would
just do it in here but today as you can
tell by the title I am doing and like an
American drugstore beauty haul because
recently I found this service this is
not a sponsored video by the way it's
called my US and it's like an
international shipping service so
basically they have a bunch of shops on
there which you can pick from you sign
up with them and they give you like a
suite which is gonna be where everything
gets shipped to and they have a bunch of
websites on there you can pick and you
can when you enter the shipping address
you enter the suite address and then
they should be out to you so I thought
great I'm going to take bunch of this
and get a bunch of American like
drugstore stuff that I can't get here
and I thought I would wall it for you
guys so let's get started so the first
thing I definitely wanted to get was the
Neutrogena kind of makeup remover stuff
so I got these when I went to Colorado
to see my sister and I literally what I
was literally in love with them when she
came out for Christmas I made sure that
she put here the two more packets
because they're so good so I got some of
these and I saw that they did hydrating
ones so I'm all about keeping my skin
really drenched even though I kind of
had a normal skin it's not oily it's not
dry but I really love to I kind of like
tau myself I've got dehydrated / dry
skin so stuff like this having your face
feeling really like wet and moisturized
it's like my favorite feeling so I've
got some of these as well and then I saw
that they did oil free eye makeup
remover which is amazing sometimes if
I'm lazy I'll just use wipes take of my
eye makeup remover but I do prefer to
take to do a different kind of thing for
my face and then using eye makeup
remover on my eyes just because
sometimes I wear love would put mascara
or I wear like lashes at the time and
glue get stuck so I find that I makeup
remover really helps to get out and make
sure that my lashes are you know keep
being nourished and
not getting stuff like Compton them
moving more onto the makeup I got two
things from L'Oreal which I'm pretty
sure you could I think I've seen on
Amazon if you're from the UK but I saw
them on their website I could drive one
of the drugstore websites apps on their
website and I wanted to get the minutes
the L'Oreal infallible eyeshadows I've
got the colors iced latte and amber rush
so I'll swatch them for you and show you
that it's like one swatch of the iced
latte shade and I'm gonna do it
so it's kind of like your classic
champagne gold shade which I thought was
really pretty and then this lease that
Amber shade so obviously right on my
street it's like a bronzy coppery
sparkly shadow so I'm in love with that
if you've got these and you'll know the
formula of them it's really buttery and
really easy to apply I don't think you
really need like a glitter base or
anything when applying and they're like
really creamy pressed pigment so I'm
definitely want to look into getting
more of these because they're L'Oreal
said it was super affordable as well
I think they've discontinued them in the
UK like drugstores so I'm gonna have to
look for more shades of these on Amazon
if you've got any of these in not these
shades and let me know in the comments
below because I really wanna look at
getting some more of these is super
pretty another eye products that I got
was the stealer the stealer eyeshadow in
the shade it's in I thought I'm really
behind on this because I think everyone
hyped about this like months and months
ago but I've never owned it and I saw it
on one of their shop websites that they
had and they thought I definitely make
the most of it and get it so looks like
this quite similar to the iced largely
infallible Ashley from L'Oreal but let
me just swatch it please it's kind of a
bit more of a champagne color than the
previous one but when I just swatch that
my finger it is like the most luxurious
thing ever I reckon this is going to
make an amazing eyeshadow as well as
like a really really pigmented highlight
so so pretty I can't wait to use that I
think they have like the foiled one in
kitten as well so I'm going to look to
see you tried that
future as well see cheek products I got
I got two more Milani baked blush is I
have two one eliminator and I really
really like the full of it so I thought
I would get some more this one here this
one is the shade Dolce pink so it's a
really nice soft pink with a tiny bit of
gold Ness right through it it looks so
so it's so pretty so it looks like this
this kind of blush colors right up my
street I really like a paler pink
blusher rather than something PG a-- but
I'm saying that I did get a peachy one
as well but that's in the shade of Dulce
this is that other one that I got it's
in the shade berry and more it's
definitely more like a bronzer pink so
I'd wear this one I'm a lot more tanned
and kind of just need a tiny bit of pink
but bronze as well you could probably
just wear this on its own it's kind of a
mixture between like a bronzer and a
blush a shade sorry to put my finger up
but you can definitely see it's kind of
got more peachy or warmer undertone so
something a little bit more out of my
comfort zone I definitely would prefer
this more when I'm tanned official
moving on to lip products this kind of a
mini haul I didn't get that much stuff I
just wanted to show you anyway and give
you some ideas and stuff like that so
I've got lip gloss from NYX I know you
can get Nixon UK but I wanted to pick
this one up this one is called sugar pie
obviously it's another nude gloss but
let me swatch it for you here it's one
of those glosses that I don't think you
can have enough of it's like the perfect
finishing color top coat and it's from
NYX so it's super super affordable and
has a cute little bow on the top which I
thought was super cute
yeah I'm not actually earned any lip
glosses from NYX I only have their soft
matte lip creams and their butter
glosses so I did want to try they're
kind of regular line of lip glosses this
is from their mega shine lip gloss range
and obviously to try it out and test the
waters I was going to go for a nude
first so I really like the look of this
way I know you can get this one in the
UK for sure but I saw it on the website
and it's been out slowking boots and
Superdrug every time I've gone in to get
it my friend amber told me that I really
needed this lip pencil in my life and it
is been
a seven lick precision pencil in the
shade I think it's just in the shade
noon I can't see it on here but it's
kind of like that classic color that's
perfect for if you'd like to over line
your lips looking at it it's quite
similar to nice and spicy Pro Longwear
pencil from Mac or like some of the room
the Rimmel London like exaggerated ones
like terms you're a dick it's super
creamy I really like a twisty up one I
feel like they got so much easier onto
the lips and make it a lot easier to
over line your lips because they're so
creamy and you don't kind of get that
kind of bumped affect so I'm really
excited to try this I been wanting it
for ages so I was really really excited
to pick that one up
finally for lip products I've got to la
splash liquid lipsticks in in the shade
exposed and romance romance is kind of
more of your sepia gray tone color like
so if you ever wanted to try sepia from
Anastasia Beverly Hills or something
like that or the is it like Lime Crime
Kashmir I think this is a bit dark than
that this is a really good affordable do
I'm yet to try them actually on the lip
they go on super super creamy onto my
hand so I feel like they're gonna be
super comfortable on the lip as well and
then the other one I got was exposed
which is obviously more like your
classic nude shade which looks like that
they're described as well but matte so
that's kind of why I'm thinking they're
gonna be really comfortable than they've
been hopefully not too drying because
I've seen you know with some liquid lips
if they can feel really powdery and
finally the last product I got was
surprise surprise a nude nail varnish
this one really captured my attention
because I've not actually heard of it or
seen it before anywhere else
it's from Essie and it's called
cocktails and coconuts which are like
well cocktails I love anyway and coconut
is like one of my favorite scents ever
so the name really caught my eye but if
I do a close-up I hope it picks up the
color it's like a really soft creamy
beige e nude but it's got glitter
running through it as well which was
like something that really drew me into
excited
of a kind of sparkly nude now monitors
you guys know so I saw this on one of
the websites I definitely wanted to get
it because you guys always are
interested in what's on my nails and my
nude nail polish collections forever
growing I'm definitely gonna do a video
on it soon so yeah this was a really
nice one that to add to my collection so
now it's the end of my mini American
drugstore beauty haul I really hope you
guys enjoyed it I'm gonna leave a link

are interested because it's a super
handy service if there's things from the
American drugstore and stuff like that

easy service and like I said this isn't
