hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I am going to be filming a kind of
try on first impressions because I've
only actually tried on a few of the
colors kind of just overall round
overall around an overall review of the
new anastasia beverly hills spring
liquid lipsticks that they came out with
i posted a picture on instagram and tons
of you asked for me to do a kind of will
just try on some of the shades or i've
got a few requests to do this kind of
video so i thought i would just do it
all in the video loads of you asked me
how i get hold of the lipstick so if you
didn't already know I am on the
Anastasia Beverly Hills PR list which is
like dreams come true so when they come
up with new things I am sent them but I
have ordered from her website before
when I was running out of my pure
Hollywood I bought it myself from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills website so view
up from the UK like me they do ship to
the UK and the shipping is not too bad I
don't think
and they also and now I think stopped on
Sephora all the liquid lipsticks and I'm
sure it won't be long before they come
to something like a Fuji Bay or cult
Beauty so there are places you can get
hold of them it came with this which
basically displays and describes all the
ten colors that she came out with and
they are at the star ever says
advertised at $20 each which i think is
about like fifteen sixteen pounds which
is not bad for a liquid lipstick because
i find liquid lipsticks to last an
extremely long time on the lip so you
don't have to always touch-up so then
they kind of last a long time in general
so you are kind of getting your money's
worth that makes sense
so i'll just go it through them and
start with the kind of the ones on the
list and how they're presented there so
i think this one was the one I was most
excited for when I saw that she was
coming up with them and it is stripped
I'll be inserting tips of me with them
on my lips there's no line or anything
just on their own as I'm talking through
them so this one's described as a
neutral beige nude if you've tried pure
Hollywood it's quite it's kind of
similar to that but like I said it well
like it says it's a bit more beige so
it's a bit more Brown this one has to be
my favorite of them all
it is obviously because it's a new
so it goes with everything I kind of
like that it's a bit more beige than
pure Hollywood so I find in the warmer
months like a browner kind of tones tend
to be more wearable like a brown and
nude kind of tone I think this look
would look good especially on people
with more like a medium skin tone on
paler skins I think it'll be like quite
a dark nude and obviously on darker
skins it will be more of like a light
nude but again wearing that definitely
wear this with a slightly darker pencil
otherwise I think it could have appeared
quite flat but yet that is stripped and
I'm literally obsessed this one's one of
my favorites of the nudes next up is
Ashton and this one is described at a
mid-tone yellow brown which I actually
would agree with if you guys follow my
snapchat I did post a picture of me
wearing this like a week ago I think
maybe if you guys saw that you know kind
of what this color looks like this color
is amazing if you like to overdraw your
lips like you don't need a pencil of
this at all it is such if you had like
naturally pigmented lips this is kind of
that kind of color so if your lips are
actually quite flush this one's do you
really I don't know the one is like it's
a really natural lip color but it is
like I said like it said like a mid-tone
Brown which is kind of what most
people's natural lip colors are I feel
like I'm just rambling but this one is
so good if you like your lips to appear
fuller because I found that I could kind
of like paint my lips a bit bigger with
this one and it looked like lips so
that's always handy but yeah this one is
Ashton and I am freaking obsessed with
all these nude ones I might be kidding
they am a size of everything those ml
and novena just always get it right with
these so the next one is catnip and this
these kind of like low lip tones
this one's described it's like a soft
plum so kind of these like lighter key
plummy tones are so so gorgeous I feel
like if you've got green eyes this would
look phenomenal because it's kind of
purply so it would really bring up the
green in your eye color and especially
with spring and stuff coming up these
kind of colors I think I like for more
like evening so you're not going like a
dark purple like dark red
it's still darker than like what I would
tend to wear on a day-to-day basis so I
would probably wear this morning like
the evening times but I think they came
out with catnip a while ago because I
already had it so I think they might
have come out with it before but they've
relaunched it with their spring
collection I'm not surprised because it
is such a gorgeous color as you'll have
seen by like the swatches and stuff but
I think you could really play up the
color with this one or you could wear it
with like a really dark purple lip
pencil and kind of get that ombre effect
or kind of pair it with maybe something
more Pinker and kind of bring up the
pink in it because it is like a plum and
plums are kind of like pinky purple
tones or maybe even like wearing it with
like a dark nude pencil and making it
more wearable that's kind of why I
really like these turns so I think
they're super pretty and you could wear
them with like just about anything and
it's going to add like a pop of soft
color into whatever makeup look you're
wearing this one is brio and if you
follow me on instagram and it is the one
I'm wearing in the thumbnail of the
picture I am obsessed normally I hate
bright Pink's because I've got really
blonde hair and bright blue eyes so I
tend to stay away from Pink's because
I'm scared I'm just going to look like a
Barbie doll and this one is pink like
it's advertised as a blue toned hot pink
it's almost neon it's so bright but I'm
obsessed with it like a special I can
tell in summer this is going to be like
my go-to lipstick because they had the
Anastasia reveals lip gloss embryo which
might as well have been a liquid
lipstick but obviously because their
glosses are so pigmented but obviously
this one is matte and I'm obsessed I
think with bright colors I have to go
Matt just because I'd be terrified it
would like wipe across my face I'm going
to have this bright mess across my face
this is like one of my favorite and like
New Found favorite bright colors I'm
trying to experiment a bit more with lip
colors because I always always always
stick with nudes but this one is just
stunning I think this would look
gorgeous on any skin tone especially if
you had like a really dark skin I think
this would look so so pretty but like I
said I think it would look stunning on
literally any skin tone this one is real
and it's def oh one of my like favorites
of them all besides the nudie kind of
colors the brights this one 100% each
other I get
so the next one is crush and it's
actually the one that I'm wearing right
now but I'll still do a close-up of the
color and swatch and be closer with it
on but this one's really nice it's still
a nude I definitely say but it's
definitely like that if you it's like a
mix between pure Hollywood and lovely
together if you've tried any of their
permanent line of liquid lipsticks I
think these ones are permanent too but I
mean like the original ones that they
came out with I love this one as well I
think I saw a picture of amber ez
wearing it and I was like yes I mean she
looks good in every lip color but this
one amazing on her and she's definitely
got more like an olive skin tone so I
think this is like the perfect nude if
you're kind of into more like pinky and
nudes and you have a slightly more
medium complexion definitely more like a
pinky purple tone nude and is the one I
have on
and I love this one too the next one is
Katherine and it's described as
described as like a brown berry color
when you first look at it it's
definitely more of when my eyes it's
definitely more about Coralie kind of
color and this I am so excited to wear
in like the summertime like the evening
out for dinner for summertime good thing
about these liquid lipsticks is
obviously they've really withstand like
drinking and eating because they dry
completely matte and that is why like I
love them so much for more like the
evening time as well as day today
because you really don't have to touch
them up ya know I definitely couldn't
see this looking at so so it's stunning
on again like them
I'm sorry everything keeps coming out
and it's probably a pretty wonky video
that anyways this one is Kathryn and I
think this one like I said is going to
be like my go-to for like this summer if
I want something that's still got color
but isn't as bright it's like Rio for
instance you're kind of maybe wanting to
try something that's kind of still nude
because it is kind of still like a
wearable color and I think the nudes are
the kind of ones that people worth of
day to day but you want a bit of color
for day today try Kathryn the next one
is Madison and this one is kind of the
second brightest one compared to Rio
this one is more of a bright neon ish
purple it's advertised as a vibrant plum
magenta and it definitely has kind of
more of a pinky
tone to it rather than like a bluey
purple tone it is again it's super super
bright and I think we look stunning if
you want a pop of color and you've got
like green eyes especially if you were
super town I think this would look so
cool it's always something I've never
really done just because I think if I
was going to go bright I would go red
orange or pink so if you want to see a
look with this let me know I think this
would be a super super fun for like
summer and spring the next one is Dolce
which is a commuted Coral
with this one I definitely think I would
want to wear a pencil with it if I was
wearing on a day to day depending on the
pencil I think you could really
transform the color so you can maybe go
like dark orange II kind of color and
make it more like an orange you hombre
layer I really like coral colors again
they're more orange tones so they bring
up a blue in my eyes but on their own I
think they can look a bit flat and
intimidating and kind of remind me a bit
of light foundation lips but I really
like this color I think it's super
wearable for the daytime love these kind
of colors for like spring actually
really pretty probably for like proms
and stuff so yeah that one is Dolce the
next one is soft lilac again she'd
already come out with this one a while
ago but I'm obsessed with these kind of
colors like I said before with the cat
neck color these are kind of like my
introductory colors because I said I
don't really like to wear purple
so lilac tones are kind of my like stuff
in there to kind of like try and wear a
purple lip but something that's a bit
more soft and wearable super super
pretty especially for the springtime I
think these kind of soft colors they've
really hit the nail on the head with all
these colors I'm like I love them all
yeah it's just kind of advertised as a
pale violet which I don't see you have
to agree with I think this one would
look really nice on people with super
fair skins as well that are kind of
wanting to try maybe more of a pinky lip
area colorful lip the bright colors
might be too intimidating on their skin
I definitely would recommend this one I
think that would look super super pretty
especially the darker pencil too and the
last one last but not least last but not
least we have naked again I think when I
first saw these liquid lipsticks
appetize stripped and naked
like 1,000 oh my god I'm going to love
them because they're the nude ones this
naked one is described as unlike peachy
nude and it is actually as you'll see by
me wearing it really peachy suit 100% I
would recommend wearing this one with a
pencil and not on its own otherwise
you're going to risk it looking super
super flat on your lips especially if
you're a lot of like a light to medium
medium all of these skin tone I think
this could look quite like foundation
lippy is that's when it's on its own
maybe if you were like super fur this
would kind of be more of like a coral
color on your skin but I tend to use
this kind of more just on its own in the
center on top of something else to just
kind of make my lips appear fuller I
think this looks super pretty
with like a gloss on the top as well I
think sometimes light nude shades that
are completely matte like I said to look
quite flat so I think this would look
really nice with something super sparkly
on the top like a moth to flame dazzle
gloss from Mac I might try that on until
that looks like because that's actually
now exciteing mean I think about it yeah
that is the last one and that is naked
so if you like super peachy light nudes
then you're gonna love that one
so that is all the spring liquid
lipsticks that Anastasia came out with
for the spring so there's ten shades in
total and they are $20 each let me know
in the comments which ones are your
favorite and ones that you really want
to try and let me know if there's ones
that you want to see me do looks with
because there's quite idly literally in
love with like every color so I'm more
than happy to do a tutorial using any of
them I'm sorry the lighting if this has
been so weird I'm very needed to film
today and like I said I'm just kind of
moving around in my rooms trying to find
one light to like I placed a film so
everything's all like little everywhere
in my house at the moment so let me know
if you like this light I know like I've
got like light patches on me I think
it's a natural my tunes ok I really hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial let me
know if there's other brands of
lipsticks as well that you want to see
like trials with or swatches or anything
like that I'm more than happy to do that
if obviously I have like a lot though
