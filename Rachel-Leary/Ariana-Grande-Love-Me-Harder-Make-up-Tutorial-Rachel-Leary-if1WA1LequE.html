inspired makeup tutorials so first of
all I'm going to start by moisturizing
my face he's my yes to moisturizer then
by the looks but her skin is pretty full
coverage in the video so I'm using my
Kat Von D look at tattoo foundation I
know my body's totally different color
to my face but that's just because I
don't really like to apply fake tan to
my face I wanted to be tan just like she
was in the video so I'm just using a
foundation that will match the color of
my body
next up his brows I'm using my a
nostalgic beverly hills dipbrow in taupe
I'm just using a flat to find a brush to
do this because her brows looks quite
small which is how I don't really tend
to have mine so I just used a flat
definer brush like you get it really
precise and not extend I like the wing
of the brow out too far as you can see
I've just done it a small amount I've
still kept it pointed at the end
you
next I sculpted out my brows using the
nyx concealer it's just a really pale
concealer and i like to sculpt up my
brows because then like i can get the
shape really precise I want it in case I
made any mistakes before and then when
you apply your eyeshadow it just gives a
really nice highlight next I applied my
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac as an
eyeshadow base I just used this as well
as the sculpting out my brows concealer
so then I can use a big fluffy brush
that you can see there from Real
Techniques and then blend it all
together using a primer we'll also just
add to the longevity of the eyeshadow
and it will just make it last a really
long time now I'm using a flesh toned
eyeshadow just to set the shadow base
and the concealer just like you wouldn't
concealer on your face this will just
make it really easy to blend now I'm
using beaches and cream and pier purely
naked by makeup geek I think with my
Sigma e-40 just to create the transition
shade in the video she was using a
really light brown so we just using a 40
to make that really soft now I'm using
glamorous and I think it was blush from
the tamanna palette and just on a flat
shader brush mixing them together just
to create a really nice pale golden
shimmer like she did in the video now
just using a light brown from the
tamanna' palette and my Mac 217 the
crease a bit further her crease wasn't
that defining the video but I just
wanted to give it a little bit of depth
just because I've got quite hooded eyes
and I'm still making it really subtle
and I'm just blending all out to make it
really soft using my Sigma e-40 next up
is eyeliner I use my NYC liquid liner
and as you can see from the pictures and
also the video she had a really really
strong cat eyeliner so it's quite hard
to explain my doing here I'm just
dragging it across as close to the lash
line and then making it a bit thicker as
I get further out if that makes sense
and then in a moment you'll see I go
really off the screen but I'm just
drying it out to create the wing and
then drawing it back in to meet the line
that I created earlier
but there's the finished result start
using my la girl Pro conceal which is
such a dupe for the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and it's like a third of the
price I use mine in the shade natural
because she wasn't that highlighted
under her eyes but I still wanted to
give it a bit of coverage just because
concealer just tidied up your eyeshadow
as well as just making your face more
put together and then I just blend that
out with a damp a Real Techniques sponge
then just to set my concealer and just
using the banana shade from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette
you
then taking corrupt from makeup geek and
just a little small brush I'm just
defining my lower lash line just really
closing nothing too much and then
blending that out using the same dark
brown from the tomato palette earlier
and just the little pencil brush that it
comes with it I didn't look like she had
much under her eyes but just wanted to
give it a little bit extra dimension now
I'm just applying mascara and this is my
Rimmel lash accelerator just a light
coax we are going to be applying lashes
but yeah just apply that to the top and
bottom lashes
then my camera decided to just as I
wanted to apply my lashes by using red
cherry 5 2 3 it's just something really
light and fluttery now I'm just using a
cream bronzer I think this is from
Bourjois and it smells like chocolate is
kind of like the cream form of their
chocolate Soleil bronzer but yeah and
then I'm just using a zoeva brush I
think it's like the lux highlighter
brush and just using that to softly
bronze up my whole face like my
cheekbones and my forehead just because
she looked really bronzed in this video
you
you
just to contour the smallest bit I'm
just using my Too Faced chocolate
bronzer and a contour brush and just
lightly just contouring my cheekbones
then using my favorite highlighter at
the moment it's the Becca shimmering
skin Perfector in moonstone is just a
really soft brush that was like really
cheap from Amazon I think and just
applying that to the tops of my cheeks
and then all over my face with the Sun
would naturally hit then using the NYX
natural lip liner just really roughly
outlining my lips because we're going to
be applying a liquid lipstick on top so
it doesn't really matter because liquid
lipsticks last a long time anyway and
this is the one from sleek I think it's
in the color birthday suit yeah and just
applying that all over the lips
then I took the headband out I was
wearing throughout the video and just
tied my hair up loosely like she did in
the video and yeah that's the end of
that I hope you liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
