today I am bringing you a evening full
appropriate glittery smokey eye so to
start with I'm gonna do my skin first
and as always I'm prepping my skin with
my Mac prep and prime to add some
hydration then going in with my L'Oreal
Lumi magique primer add a bit of
radiance to my skin and on the top of
that I'm going to be applying my NARS
all day luminous foundation in the shade
Stromboli
then I went ahead and did my eyebrows
off camera using the stunningly ladylike
a fluid line from Sigma and the
anastasia dipbrow and medium brown as
always I do link the tutorial to how I
fill in my eyebrows in the description
below now I'm going in with the zoeva
cocoa cocoa blend palette and the pale
vanilla shade then mixing the same shade
with the kind of caramel soft brown
shade and just buffing that into my
crease with a mortgage lending brush
then going in with the darker brown
shade from the same palette on a smaller
morphe blending brush I'm just using
that to deepen up my soccer
using down brown and brown script mixed
together on a blending brush I'm just
using that again to further deepen up
the socket and add a bit more of a
gradient effect at the base I'm using
the crown chubby eye pencil in the shade
I think it was something chocolate hot
chocolate maybe which is just a really
deep brown and basically just using this
as a primer for something to the glitter
to adhere to
going in with an even darker Brown this
is embark also by Mac just using that to
further deepen up the socket and blend
the chubby pencil in with the previous
eyeshadows so it all transitions nicely
then using some lash glue just dabbing
that on top of the base and this is what
the glitter is going to stick to the
glitter I'm using is champagne kisses
from violet boss and I am just pressing
this on top of the glue
then on a really small tapered blending
brush I'm going back in with embark and
I think I'd mix it with carbon here also
just to add a bit more depth my inner
corner highlight I'm using this
champagnes diamond pencil from Charlotte
Tilbury just as something a bit more
subtle rather than something really
bright and white then as always I'm
applying my favorite mascara which is
the Mac extended play just because I'm
going to be putting lashes on top and
this one doesn't add too much volume
just kind of defines my lashes ready to
apply falsies
these are the lashes I'm going to be
using they're from backstage lashes in
the style Chelsea they're super natural
and have a really thin lash band as
we're not wearing liner this is super
helpful and then going back in with
brown script on a pencil brush and just
running that along my lash line making
sure connected to the wing we created
also going in with embark just to
further deepen up the lower lash line
and blending that out too also using the
pencil that we use as a base and putting
that in my waterline as well
is I complete I'd then went ahead and
highlighted in contour my face as per
usual I'm thinking of doing of updated
full-coverage flawless foundation
routine soon I will show you guys how I
do that then I'm then going in with the
Rimmel addiction lip pencil and the I'm
nude Geoffrey start liquid lipsticks and
so this is the finished result I hope
