today is an exciting video it is a
collab with the gorgeous glitter a
little here on YouTube or if you know
her as Chloe Morton we got to talking on
Twitter and decided to film a autumn
slash full regular from makeup look I've
gone for a more natural simple eye
makeup with a dark lip and she's gone
opposite she's gone for more dark eye
and a more wearable lip so if the choice
of two I would leave the link to her
video down below make sure to give her
some love she's actually amazing so
consistent on YouTube one of the first
people I ever subscribe to just because
I found her really relatable and if
you're like a similar age to me you
should probably subscribe and do the
same she's honesty so nice as well and
yeah I was so excited when we decided to
collab so make sure to give her chunks
and love I will leave all social media
links down below yeah if you like the
look of this makeup then please keep
watching start off I'm going to be using
my anastasia beverly hills dipbrow in
medium brown and my benefit gimme brow i
think this is the light one yet so this
is in light/medium just to fill in my
brows but i'm going to be doing this off
camera just because i already have a
tutorial in it so if you want to see
that our link is down below with
eyebrows done i'm going to move on to my
eyes first just because it's going to be
more of a winged outlook and i prefer to
do my eyes first before my foundations
just in case there's any fallout with
eyeshadow so I'm going to be using my
Mac painterly Paint Pot on a morphe M
two to four brush just to look like that
to highlight my inner corner and brow
bone I'm going to be using it Gesser by
Matt just because this is going to be a
Matt's look so I want to use something
Matt I like the inner is this time just
buffing that in and a corn out on a
floppy crown brush and applying it
really softly of the brow bone highlight
just under this barrel our initial
transition shade are wanting to keep it
really soft because most of the arches
are going to be using a really cool
toned so I'm just going in with soft
peach by anastasia beverly hills artist
couture
well traveler palette i think this is
and just blending that really softly
into the crease on a sigma e40 brush so
you can be as messy as you want with
this taking it as far out as you want
because that's why we don't do
foundation flats just because we're
going to be cleaning up with a wipe so
you can be as messy as you like then
using my Naked 3 palette I haven't used
this in other so I thought I'd use it
for this tutorial I'm just taking the
shade limit limit just to deepen up the
socket on a zoeva
2 to 7
and just going back in with my Sigma
brushes to blend the two together just
building up the color gradually because
it's quite a soft color
then on the same zoeva brush and the
same naked palette I'm taking the shade
noona so it's basically the same
undertone as when you put forward just
like your darker just to deepen up the
socket further
then on the Sigma small tapered p45
blending brush I am taking the shade
Swiss chocolate by Mac
then going back to the Urban Decay
palette I am taking the shade strange as
my lid color keeping everything very
matte like so and just going back in
with the same brush as before and a tiny
bit more for this chocolate just to bust
those two together
then also on the same brush I'm taking
the shade in bark by Mac as well just to
finally deepen up the socket
then using any sort of makeup remover
I'm just going to use a wipe I'm just
going to clean up the edge from the
bottom of my lower lash line towards the
tail of my brow now on to eyeliner I'm
going to be using a Mac black track and
probably a bit of NYC the NYC liquid
liner just to get a clean cut I do have
a wink eyeliner tutorial so I will link
that down below as well so this is the
liner done I'm then going to go ahead
and apply mascara and I'm going to be
using the sin sin eurocity lash mascara
by Sigma and just applying it my top
lashes because I prefer to use the
napkin extended play for my bottom
lashes
I love this mascara I have a discount
code with Sigma by the world Bible oh by
the way as well I'll leave that in the
description bar down below to see so
many of you guys wanted to get any of
the brushes I use or mascara now on top
lashes because I've created a bit of a
flip or bit of a flick a big flip cat
eye look with the eye shadow I'm going
to stick that stick with that with the
lashes so I'm going to be using the doha
lashes by Lilly ghalichi and I'm just
going to apply those now so this is what
the eyes look like with the lashes are
these I think must be in my top three
favorite style of lashes ever they
winged out just the perfect amount in
there so fluttery kind of natural
looking for lashes because I think
they're mink ones but yes I am love them
but now on to face makeup to prime my
skin I am using the Smashbox primer
water for foundation today I'm going to
be using the l'oreal true match
foundation in the shade w4 golden
natural and just buffing that into my
skin with a Beauty Blender
you guys probably going to tell me that
this foundation is really yellow but
that's the kind of look I like an
affirmation
you've gotta know it does match the kind
of my net guys and not just being stupid
poor concealer I'm going to be using the
collection lasting perfection concealer
in the shade number one fair I think
this is the palest one that they do just
to highlight under my eyes above my brow
bone down the side of my nose and just
all the regular faces
I can't believe myself never thought
this would be our but it's nothing
sticking with the Mac theme I'm going to
set my under eyes with the laura mercier
translucent setting powder and I'm going
to be doing the baking method just
because that's the way I find they get
the most flawless matte looking skin so
I'm just going to be taking a powder
puff and kind of dabbing it into the top
part off the powder pile like that so
it's just on the top and then just
pressing it into the places I've applied
the concealer what's left to lose their
fear
I know I look really silly but um
while that is clicking I'm just going to
apply a contour and this is Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit in the shade I
think it's the light to medium one and
this is the shade born just to my
cheekbones with the zoeva luxe face
paint brush
I'm gonna be using my Mac 137 brush just
to dust away the powder I see in the sky
gazing far into the night I raise my
head
down to the fire but it's no use cuz you
can't stop it from shining through to
highlight and bronze my cheeks I'm
easing the laura mercier iridescent face
I light up our nothing but really
lightly just because everything else is
quite matte but I do like to have a bit
of shine to my cheekbones
then for a bit of blush I am going to be
taking this shade here from the morphe
10d color just line up to the top of my
cheekbones
to finish up my eyes I'm just taking
noon out from the Urban Decay palette
from Urban Decay palette that we used
earlier just running it under my on a
pencil brush
then as always to client my bottom lash
mascara which is Mac extended play
now onto let's I'm lining my lips using
the jeweled at jaw down at retractable
pencil liner in the shade Cabernet and
before you guys ask I get any kind of
American smaller brand product like
georgeanna when I use Mullaly and stuff
like that I get it all and Amazon is in
the sky gazing far into the night I
raise my head
answer the fire but it's no use cuz you
can't stop it from shining through then
tip on my lips I'm using Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in the
shade
justice shoes
so this is the finished look guys I hope
