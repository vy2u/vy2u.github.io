so today and bring you a ten pounds and
under I'm growing a back to school haul
just because everything I kind of got I
feel is appropriate for back to school
ah it's appropriate for back to school I
mean obviously depending on what school
you go to or like what level of school
that you are
it will depend these are just slightly
little things that like I'm I've
considered with if I was going back to
school or starting University or
something as just ways of like
encouraging myself to go back because I
always find might buy something new you
know if you buy a lot new gym clothes it
kind of is meant to help you motivate
yourself to go to the gym so I've got a
few like accessories some clothes and a
little bit of like stationery and stuff
and just spiked things that are really
quite cheap that might make stuff that
you already have more exciting I feel I
can be scrambling so I'm just gonna jump
straight into it so the first place I
did a little bit of shopping was a sauce
and the first thing I got that was only
five pounds it's this faux fur fluffy
keyring to put like on your locker keys
or I actually got to put on a new bag
that I got and I know a lot of people do
buy new bags before they go back to
school as I was used to get any bad I
think like every year it was always like
new look alike who remembers booty oh my
god yeah I always used to get like a new
school bag and I recently just picked up
a black one and it's kind of just
obtained like that so I wanted to get
something so I had to put on it and I
thought this would be really cool to put
on like your school bag or like I said
on your keys like the look of KISS you
don't lose them in your bag or just
something like that and it was like
really really cheap as well and I really
loved this color for like the autumn
full time so yeah I feel like all of my
friends I've got a couple pom pom
another mama red one so I will be the
red one in the group the next thing I
thought would be a super super handy to
carry around in your school bag and I've
lost something it's already because I
use some but it is this and it is on a
sauce as their everyday hair basic scare
I just feel like this is kinda like a
staple like if you're at school in PE or
doing sports or like your hair just need
something carrying this around in your
bag all the time to ensure that you or
anyone else
around you you are covered it's just got
loads of like of these golden hair clips
there's these clips and there's hair
ties and this was literally like five
pounds I think you'll probably even get
it cheaper like Primark or something
like that but I was on ASOS and I saw
this and I said yes if I was in school I
would so should have got this and code
it around the amount of time doesn't PA
needed a hair tie it was someone around
me always needs a hair tie and you're
always hanging them out and then you
realise you've got no hair ties of
yourself so this is I thought would be
handy to kind of just carry around in
your bag the next thing I got was kind
of only a bit of stationery but I
thought it was really really funky
design it is this golden ring binder
it's only this big it's quite a small
one I got this for me to put my
accounting and contracts in like
business sea life stuff in but I thought
this would be really really cool for the
sea if you've been back school likes its
form as one of your subject folders or
something like that it's actually from
paper tricks I had no idea that a sauce
actually stopped paper trays so I was
able to like get you know that's like a
sauce to do student discount anyway so
you can get discount and pictures mind
you student discount in forever
you can shop for clothes and shop the
stationery is what I mean yeah I'm just
in love with this design it's really
like sleeker yeah this was only like
eight pounds I think and inside it's
quite a cool floral print and it does
come with like dividers and stuff so
yeah I thought that was really cool this
is probably the only like proper school
a back to school glee item in terms of
stationery and stuff but yeah like I
said I thought it was really cool really
funky and I love getting new folders and
stuff what I used to love getting new
folders and stuff and if I was going
back to school I definitely pick up a
for you both please and the final thing
I've got from a source might be a bit
hit-and-miss and because the hot weather
is kind of coming to an end now and some
schools may not I'm not really sure
you'll decide for yourselves
basically I really wanted a pair of I
want to say leggings but they go down to
your knee so they're not really really
lot like I said they go down to your
knee which I think isn't pretty
acceptable in most schools I think it
was knee length that everything had to
be so these are perfect and I really
like
in a sense that I probably smell like a
big baby t-shirt with them and like some
trainers and stuff just as something a
bit different I get sick of riding the
same like leggings on the top every day
so like that I've got a couple of well
this and another pair of leggings and
they're both slightly different to your
plain black leggings even though I know
these are playing black but they're just
shorter and I thought that's quite
fashionable at the moment and something
a little bit different hopefully kind of
acceptable in school but as the weather
is still kind of humid but it's getting
a bit colder I thought these would work
and you could wear them it's just like
oh my god anyways I thought these would
work with just like a big like tisha on
Daisy might eat just have like one less
need to go in for just two something
different stylish and easy to wear
uncomfortable as well okay so that is
all that I got from a sauce now on to
pretty little thing I only got one thing
I don't think they work they will always
be under ten pounds but they are
currently in the sale and it is these
leggings now I'm going to look and you
can see that they have like a criss
cross pattern down the both of the legs
I thought these are really funky because
I wear a lot of basic t-shirts as you'll
see I'm going to show you a couple of
other ones yeah I wrote of like playing
jumpers and basic t-shirts that don't
really have anything on them and I
thought this would look cool just just
like to add a little Sun science and I
out there I didn't think schools would
frown upon them unless they think it's
gonna be distracting for boys but the
holes of bloody tiny so I should hope
not to control the boys yeah they've
just got that print all down in the
front like that and they've got like a
really comfortable flattering fit like
around the middle and these are
currently eight pounds in the pretty
little thing sale I don't think they'll
probably I'm assuming they'll stay back
and sell but I've linked everything down
below so click it while you can while
hopefully it's still on sale but they're
called Rach Rach black lace-up leggings
or something like that so I'm kind of
scrolling it saw the price saw the name
I was sold
love those by the way sorry I'm not
trying anything on it's my time of the
month and you know you just
don't want to be like packing clothes on
anything like tight or anything
moving on to boohoo I always shop at
foodie for like my accessories and stuff
and I got one item of clothing so we'll
start with the item of clothing it's
really really basic and simple I feel
like that's what school is for is
literally just a plain black kind of
v-neck scooped front or do you suit just
because I think sometimes I wear quite a
look like a loose fitted jeans like mom
jeans and start sometimes just like a
bit a t-shirt on top of like another
baggy thing like sometimes it's just
it's too baggy too much bag edge you
know I mean and I think these actually
can kind of be a bit more comfortable
and like sit a bit nice and be a bit
more flattering and it's literally would
if you wore it just like a plain black
long sleeve top which is kind of why I
have like a white one of these as well
and they're just super super wearable
and you can wear them loads like lobster
leggings or jeans and like a jacket and
stuff and I just think plain body suits
are a really nice replacement for tops
just cuz I think they fit a bit nicer
than they like can suck you in and hold
you in and all the right places so yeah
just to play that black one for school
because you're not going to the club or
nothin but yeah and I think this was
like 10 pounds I think I'm not sure a
boo boo do student discomfort they've
always got offers on so you can probably
get it but you probably get it for like
even cheaper but yes a plain black
bodysuit doesn't go amiss this season
and the last three things I got from
boohoo are like accessories like I said
it would depend on kind of like what
stage of school you're going to or like
how adventurous you are or what kind of
things that you wear that this might
apply to you but all the accessories
I've got a kind of basic so again you
can kind of like just decide for
yourself but I got this plain black
fabric choker literally just of a scene
goes wrong like that so just on days if
you're just going into school and like
it really can't build to bear anything
and it's just like black t-shirt black
leggings this would just kind of like I
don't know I know schools not like a
fashion show and it's not like a fashion
statement and this is an exact screaming
designer look at me
you but like I know quite a lot of
people might think while I wear that to
school but you know I'm only little but
some people do and I think it's just
plain black fabric so if you wanted to
be a little bit adventurous at school if
you're going to university and stuff
like this is to iron by this to
university just just to spice up an
outfit I really didn't want to put in
effort with my clothes just to kind of
make it look a bit more put together and
this was only three pounds so loved it
this one's slightly more out there I
guess but it's still quite plain is this
golden choker
so again if you would just run an
all-black outfit and wanted to add a bit
some summon to it this would look really
nice um I've recently got the Puma black
and gold creeper trainer type shoe so I
would totally wear them but like it all
back up and this type thing so you can
see that still looking pretty simple up
and in my opinion isn't really too out
there for school
it depends how young you are and I keep
saying but it depends on what level of
school you're going into but yeah I just
think this is kind of cool and then the
last thing I got from boohoo was
actually just a belt and this one is
this one was literally a father and I
had a belt and I lost it and it was a
bit thinner than this and I saw kind of
the thickness of this one and I love
this I love wearing belt sometimes just
feels like jeans and stomped out a bit
of it an accessory or if I'm wearing
like the hard rub this is like silver so
if I was wearing like silver accessories
and stuff oh yeah like I said just to
kind of add a little something to a pair
of jeans and an outfit or good jeans too
big whatever you need to be held in a
belt to never goes amiss and I think you
can wear this you could tie it round
with a t-shirt dress or just something
like that I think playing the black belt
like everyone should have one just in
case and these are really nice loops
cuts as well I know something I can keep
saying depends on what school you're
going to get out tourists go or not but
yeah I think a plain black belt is a
must-have accessory not necessary for
just school but like just generally and
last but not least I have two t-shirts
from a misguided they're not very
exciting
don't get your hopes up I love shopping
at misguided basic I think their quality
is so so so good and obviously if you
lower the price literally under ten
pounds they have so much good stuff on
there a lot of it is like old old old
sales stuff but you forgot about and
it's like we're all really really nice
and also like I said their basics and
pretty nice as well so I had a massive
pair of my wardrobe the other day and I
realized I don't actually have a plain
white t-shirt I like and like
uncomfortable wearing it was like a few
they were too small they were too
cropped or the neckline just wasn't
right so I got a plain white t-shirt and
it's got like a little pocket at the
front and this was literally like 10
pounds or maybe a bit under stocking up
on basics it's so important for school
just because realistically on the first
day you'll go in there like you're fast
and then it's the next day already and
you've given up with life and that was
what I did so just like I think basics
are a must
just to go is like leggings or jeans or
just they're just the most comfortable
thing and the misguided ones my favorite
because the quality is still really
really good and super affordable as well
so yeah just a plain white t-shirt but I
mean you can at least literally anywhere
but this isn't really nice when I have
that little pocket to so you could put
like stuff in there like a pencil hair
clip boys number I'm getting beta I mean
and then last but not least is this
t-shirt and it's kind of a bit more out
burn than just a basic so it's just this
rose-colored they had these in it so so
so many colors
I just rewarded like this blush color at
the moment and it has that little cross
thing at the front now I thought this
was going to come up route like quite
small so I got like a bigger size than I
normally would I put it on and it does
come down quite low so maybe get like
your actual size or maybe one smaller
just because you don't I know schools
are funny about like having like your
chest out or whether but if you don't
have like a massive chest it's not a
huge issue but just as a pre-warning it
is actually quite baggy and I was I got
it wrong but yeah I mean so I because
I'm not at school is not a massive
problem for me and you know
I'm not one to not get my chest out it's
not that one I think that's just really
nice just to kind of wear with something
basic as well I'm glad I just the matter
of time to take a scan this video
honestly yeah I just thought something a
little bit different and it crossed over
that front and that's quite in style at
the moment I really like this one I wore
out the other day and lots of people
said they liked it but that's it I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and got some maybe inspiration or found
something that you liked for
back-to-school and like I said
everything is under ten pounds and I've
linked them all down below so you're not
going to be very keen the bank by
getting any of these things and I think
some of them are really good bits they
look expensive or like they might help
you with enough they already have to
make it more exciting or just like
something so see when you go back to
school don't you want to make a bit of
an entrance these people might have seen
you in a while so you want to just show
them that you're still on trend still
looking good but you're not breaking the
bank give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and make sure to subscribe if
you haven't already and let me know if
