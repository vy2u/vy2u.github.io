today I thought I would do a different
kind of video just to sit down talking
to you and basically just show you all
of the things I've accumulated over the
past couple of weeks
so there's makeup there's skin care nail
varnishes and stuff like that so I just
like to show you most of the time I do
post a picture on Instagram anyway so a
lot of this stuff you might already see
might already have seen if you follow me
on Instagram but yeah I love this stuff
I've used already but I just thought I
would show you about it so let's get
started we box of stuff
it's a haunt makeup let's go it again so
I got a few things from NARS the first
thing that I got was the NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade custard I
already have this in the shade Chantilly
but Shanti's like the palest shade so I
really like the formula of it and the
consistency of this but it was literally
making me like really stark white for
the days I didn't want to like have a go
really highlighted face but it's going
to conceal this is the perfect shade for
me so I picked that up and I've got the
NARS pressed powder in Beach so it's
like this so it's a really kind of light
yellow shade but not light enough for
like under your eyes this is like my
skin color shade so I use this all over
my face and it gives the most flawless
finish I love this and then the next one
oh yeah I got the light reflecting
setting powder in pressed now this is
really wet it's not like a powder it's
literally like a sponge like hardly
anything comes off when you swatch it
but when you put it on your face
something magical happens on this just
like absorbs all the oils in your face
and kind of reflex it as like a really
natural matte finish
I don't really know but it's I really
like this so far I kind of used this in
places that kind of need touching up for
like oil and stuff like that I'll always
just kind of use that for them and then
the next thing I got was this
illuminator in the shade for one 3v l KR
I'm not really sure I really wanted the
one that was hot sand but they
completely sold out that one and I was
gonna get one no matter what because
with the spring and stuff like that
coming up I love a good highlighter so I
got this one it's a really light
champagne shade it's almost like a
translucent shimmer it's not too
pigmented anything like that and I
really like that in a highlighter cuz I
hate to look like I'm wet and so I liked
it say I like that one also for
concealers I picked up the Urban Decay
Naked skin weightless complete coverage
concealer and I'm wearing this today and
I love this I got mine in the shade
light warm and I think they have it in a
shade like miniature as well I think the
light warm shade is just slightly more
yellow I much prefer to look yellow then
pink so I picked this one up I'm sure
you've heard everyone and then mum
talking about this but wanna see it is
so good so I know this I've shown it to
you but so you're definitely working I
got mine from Debenhams because
everywhere else seem to be sought out
with Temenos I always forget diamonds
have feminists have Mac Urban Decay and
those other brands like online I know
the devil is in me has other decay in it
but it doesn't have Mac in it but they
have it online so if there's someone
something that from those kind of brands
that it's always thought of everywhere
else it's always like chicken tenders
they go to so the next thing is that
show you so much okay so I got a few
things sent to me from the company or
Charlotte's which is like an Australian
makeup brand and you would have seen me
already used one of the totes and a
tutorial that's already up steps like
the last one I did I thought I'd do some
that sent me so they sent me two of them
metallics eyeshadows you saw me using
this one in the shade of gold Gaga but
I'll switch bleep anyways but yeah so
this is like a really gorgeous rose gold
shade and the makeup revolution rose
gold ones recent uh but this one they
didn't give you like a mixing medium for
this one which you did to get with the
makeup revolution one because that's
kind of how you get the most out of that
product but this one you can use it
straight in the pot and I really like
that then this and that one's called
gold Gaga and this one is called Lana de
Lana Del gray and again it's the same
formula as before but it's just a really
nice dark coal kind of color with a bit
of party blue running through it so let
me know if you want to see it too Tories
in this one because I always like to do
room looks on my channel and I feel like
I should switch it up so let me know if
you want to see tutorials and I did it
also sent me a hook twisty liner and I'd
much prefer the twisty up one so I got
probable because I'm I would only really
wear a bold color like this in my
waterline to add kind of like a pop of
color and using the pencil can be really
hard on my waterline so I love a creamy
one they kind of remind me of the Mac
technicals but this is just a really
vibrant purple shade and I really like
for my blue eyes so I love this one it
also sent me a color and Jack
moisturizing mineral lipstick and this
or just it's called the super Crump like
Coralie red shade no it's kind of more
like an orange yeah so orange is a lot
of like cosmetic brands are coming out
with a lot of oranges I feel like orange
is gonna be much
inside they also another lip product
they sent me it was a velu lips matte
lip cream in the shade ho chi minh and
that is like oh like a really light baby
pink so I'm probably wear this with like
a nude lip liner underneath or maybe
like a slightly darker pink leather I
don't get that like ombre look going it
also it sent me this makeup finishing
spritz in the shan aloe vera and
rosewater and it's basically like a
makeup setting spray oh that's nice
I can tell and like the mornings and
stuff like that this is going to be
really refreshing to like wake you up so
love that one and then they also sent me
this is what I was most excited about
their finishing powder in the shade true
translucent I've been looking for a
brief decent translucent setting powder
for ages that's why I got the press run
from Mac just because translucent ones
I've got the NYX HD one like ages ago
and in pictures it just made my under
eyes look like white and I was like what
the is happening like translucent
the same powders are just meant to
really set your face make it look the
best that I can and that was literally
not what it was doing for me and it was
an HD when as well and I put it on it
kind of sunk into my skin really weird
so I've not used that one since so I'm
really excited to try this one so the
next couple of things I got was from a
website called Beauty Bailey so I got
this which I also used in my last
tutorial
it's the OCC glitter in beige and I've
seen so many people use it like lustre
Lux and desi and stuff and it looked
amazing and it is just as pretty as I
looked on there but yeah it's so nice I
don't really have many things from OCC
so I was quite excited to try this one
the next thing I got is probably my most
useful thing I'm literally down to here
weather and I got it like two weeks ago
I'm obsessed with it it's the Jane
Iredale lip liner in nude and a lot of
you have been asking you recently what's
been on my lips and it's always been
this and either the NYX soft matte lip
cream in Cairo or the Anastasia Beverly
Hills liquid lipstick in pure Hollywood
I have this on my lips today with pure
Hollywood and a bit of milkshake in the
middle or from Anastasia Beverly Hills
those two lip products but yeah orange
would I recommend this for like over
lining your lips and stuff like that
because it is beautiful the next two
things I picked up were nail varnishes
actually it's this one so I got this
nail varnish also from beautybay it's
from OPI in the shade simone sand I've
got a couple other nude nail varnishes
that I've been loving at the moment -
yeah this one is called picked perfect
and this one is called perennial chic if
you've been watching desi Perkins on
snapchat you'll note this kind of looks
like because I bought it because I
thought it alone hey also it's like a
really light like a really light nude
color this one is perennial sheep then
this one is called picked perfect and
it's a slightly deeper nude it's kind of
a more brownie nude then pinky nude so
I'm gonna paint my nails with this one
and next and then this one from OPI is
kind of more similar to the first one
this one's called the Simone sound
they're really getting into nail large
at the moment I don't know what it is
doing with this like the summer coming
up and stuff I'm not really being very
adventurous with colors so so the next
things I'm gonna go on to is kind of
skincare the first thing that I picked
up was this nip and fab dragon's blood
fix plumping Mars now I saw this because
Carly Jenna had been using it and I
thought
I want to look like ah I will use this
arguing but I've never I don't really
use masks and I kind of really want to
get into them and this one is so it's
like this and when you put it onto your
fingers it's like a clear gel and it
suggests that you apply a thick layer to
a clean face and leave it on for 10
minutes and then rinse off or you can
leave on overnight like a really intense
nighttime treatment which I did the
other day and I woke up and to be fair
my skin did look really good so I've
been using this recently and this but
I'll let you know because I've kind of
been like breaking out slightly I don't
know it's because this I really really
hope it's not them fingers cause the
next skin care thing I got was a daily
cleansing gel and this is wrong Palmer's
and it's like the people that do like
the cocoa butter stuff that smells
heavenly so I've been using this kind of
after I've taken off my makeup just to
see if there's any leftover dirt and
I've been actually really quite
surprised how much dirt has been left on
my skin after taking off my makeup that
I would usually have just left but then
using this on like a cotton pad just
going over my skin removed so much more
than I thought it would so that leaves
my skin feeling a lot cleaner and I feel
like it's kind of helped improve my skin
but then evidently not have been
freaking oh yeah and the final thing I
picked up was the Bondi sand every day
gradual tanning milk body moisturizer I
saw this after watching I think her
name's Riya Estelle on YouTube her
everyday tanning routine and she uses
this kind of after she showed off her
fake town the next day and then it puts
this one I thought it was a really good
idea because I always hate to show off
my fake tan the next day because I feel
like it's all just come off and what was
the point in that so what this is gonna
do it's kind of moisturize your skin
which is what you're meant to do but
then it's a gradual tanning moisturizer
as well so you're going to get that tan
back like the next day I think so yeah
I'm already loving this and it smells
like coconuts and it smell
so that's kind of everything that I've
accumulated I know I don't know that was
a lot or not that I'd like to sitting
down and talking to you guys I feel it's
a lot more carefree and I don't have to
keep worrying on folks or not because
I'm just saying talking to you
let me know if you want to see a hauls
in the future because I enjoy buying
things and showing you guys so um let me
know if you enjoyed this video by giving
it a thumbs up or leave it in a comment
below do I see any looks with the stuff
that I've shown you but yeah until next
time I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
