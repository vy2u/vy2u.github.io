as I kind of have been saying on all my
social medias the first like whew and
like majority of see of my videos for
2017 I wanted to really do one sir I
know you guys wanted to see and when
I've been asking recently what videos
you want to see loads of you said a kind
of roundup of my 2016 beauty favorites
so I've picked a high end and a
drugstore kind of option of each
category I have not done every catch we
look I don't have like an eyeliner one
or all I lip pencils or anything like
that
because I feel like I pick and choose
with them and I don't have one specific
stand out one that I've used all year
yeah without further ado let's go ahead
and begin
so I'm going to start off with primers
and I think these kind of really both of
these products kind of took off in 2060
I'm trying not to like ramble about each
one because got so many products to get
through but my drugstore primer of the
year of the last year was definitely the
Nivea post shave balm I feel its credit
to nikkietutorials who kind of brought
this to life and showed everyone and
kind of showed them all science side of
makeup as the ingredients in this do
make makeup last longer in the sense
that as I think it was like glycerin or
like something in it that makes
something tacky it's the makeup that you
put on top sticks to it so this is such
a good primer if you've not jumped on
the bandwagon yet to try it definitely
an affordable option and my high end
primer you can see like it's literally
all gone is the Too Faced hangover X
primer
it's so like hydrating and creamy at the
same time and I definitely feel like my
makeup stays on when I use this I like
to concentrate this mainly down like the
t-zone of my nose and I find yeah my
makeup lasts this so it does exactly
what it says on the tin okay for
foundation I feel like loads of you
think that my high-end option will
probably be Giorgio Armani luminous silk
but that wasn't a favorite for 2016 I
mean that's a favorite like all year
every year
whatever I'll start with my high-end
option and that is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD stick I'm not sure if it was
this year or last year that they bought
the kind of Ultra HD range out I
definitely prefer the stick version I
feel like stick foundations in general
were a massive 2016 height loads of
brands
well those with brands bought them out
and I feel like this and has a brilliant
nice coverage to it customizable
coverage as well and amazing at color
range and has a really nice kind of
Julie it's satin finish so I really
liked this one my favorite drugstore
foundation of the previous year and I'm
sure will continue to be was the
Maybelline matte me Paulus matte and
poreless foundation I love this I love a
matte finish and this is a pretty good
drugstore foundation for a night out in
the sense that I feel like with matte
finishes they last a lot longer than
anything with a satin or dewy finish and
it really clings to your skin has a
really nice medium coverage that you
could build up or maybe sheer down if
you wanted to and obviously if such a
good price because it's Maybelline I
feel like Maybelline have really good
foundations in general and this one was
my favorite okay on the two powders I
feel like this year was the year for me
to realize that translucent powders are
like the best thing for my skin and my
drugstore translucent powder or just
like powder
I loved over the past year was the
remote clear compact complexion powder
this is like a go-to powder to bring
like in my cut bag on a night out like
it just magnifies your skin does exactly
what it says on the tin such a good
price as well obviously because it's rum
at the drugstore I know loads of people
hype over the real stay matte powder I
think this is pretty much the same this
is just the translucent version yeah it
doesn't really give it a huge amount of
coverage just mattifies my skin which is
exactly what I want and I just kind of
concentrate it in the place so I get
oily and you can make it into like a
loose powder as well like I've shown you
tips on how to do that too and yes when
you've not tried this and you're in the
market for like a good powder will do
some really good ones and of course I
think you guys know my high-end powder
of the year was Laura everyone I think
like the whole baking thing kind of took
off in 2016 I know it's kind of been
around for years in drag makeup and
stuff but Laura Mercier has been like
such a good powder I feel like it lasts
a long time as well you get a lot for
your money and it's just one of the best
parts I've used there's no flashback or
anything so yeah I know a lot of you
guys know I'm obsessed this pattern
you're probably sick to death of me
talking about it but I talk about it
because it's the best so Laura Mercier
was my high end powder of the year okay
on to concealer so I just I've done a
lot of work with them and it's not just
because I work with them that I pick
their products I it's more like the
other way around in the sense that like
I want their products are so great which
is why I love to work with them so my
drugstore concealer of the year is the
Maybelline age rewind concealer I love
this the sponge applicator is so nice
underneath your eyes because underneath
your eyes is a really sensitive part you
don't want to be like scraping like any
sort of hard wand or anything underneath
there and this is just got such an
amazing coverage and it's so easy to
blend out I love this one especially in
the shade light to help brighten up
underneath my eyes and my high-end
concealer of the year and probably will
be left like ever
besides the NARS one is definitely the
Sharpe mmm the Tarte shaped tape
concealer everyone raves about this I
think you can get it on QVC UK or so you
can order it from Sephora and stuff but
honestly try it if you get the chance it
is a phenomenal it's got such a like big
wand it covers so much the coverage is
amazing they have so so so many colors
for their color range and yeah honestly
everyone's been raving about this and
there's a reason behind it and it's
because it's this okay on it two bronzes
I have been obsessing over the Galactica
bronzer in Cabo I've been seeing lust
LOX rave about this for ages and then in
in 2016 I was lucky enough for galactic
to reach out to me and I desperately
wanted to try this and I knew I was
going to love it tried it and I did like
there's a lot of bronzers on me can be
quite orange eaten and I've got to
really kind of stay away from that with
having such light blonde hair this is
like the most perfect olive toned
bronzer that like I discovered that year
I know I use like Mac mineralize
skinfinish and dark golden a lot and
that is a favorite of mine like a
high-end favorite but that's been a
favorite for years so in 2016 I
discovered this and I loved it
really really hoping that beautyberry
brings like galactic products because
they are so good and my drugstore
bronzer of the year is kind of like a
mix but it is the sleek kind of face
form in medium that is a highlight in
there as well which I don't particularly
use but they have a really gorgeous
shimmery bronzer and a matte bronzer as
well the color again is very cool tone
and then that shimmery one is a lot
warmer so it really complements my skin
and it's an acute little travel packet
like this and obviously cuz there's a
highlighter in it as well it's amazing
for traveling which I am lucky enough to
do quite a lot so yeah I've been that I
love like sleek products in general they
had such an amazing 2016 and I can't
wait for 2017 to show you guys stuff
that's going on but yes I'm obsessed
with this and I discovered this in 2016
and I loved it okay on it to blusher
my high-end blush of the year was the
Becca luminous blusher in it Tigerlily
it is the most gorgeous oranjee color
I've ever used it's got such a radiant
finish to it and orange obviously is one
of my favorite colors to wear on my face
in the sense that it really brings out
the color of my eyes so yeah I've been
loving these performing of these is it
beautiful and if you haven't already I
definitely recommend trying out their
blushes they've got such a huge ring
actually not a massive range but it's
quite like a diverse range of colors
and yet the formula of them is beaut and
I didn't really get to try a huge amount
of drugstore blushes this year Justin I
just never picked any up but one that
will always be a favorite and that I did
reach for a lot more in 2016 or just
like rediscovered my love for was the
Milani at luminous blush in Luminoso I
know you guys have had loads of people
talk about this because it is such a
gorgeous and diverse color I think it
suits pretty much everyone I mean on
darker skin tones it might come across a
tiny bit more light and actually
noticeable but I know they have other
they have other colors and the formula
of them again is also really gorgeous as
well and this is just a really gorgeous
rose gold color and I love it onto
highlighters I feel like this was the
year for highlighters everyone was
bringing out highlighters and I couldn't
just pick a single one and the two ones
I've actually picked up a palette so the
first one is my high-end one and it is
the anastasia beverly hills ultimate
glow kit anastasia beverly hills bought
out all their like glow kits in 2016 and
i think they smushed out the park with
them the formula is beautiful this one
obviously is six like these smaller ones
and all the other ones that they brought
out there were for kind of quite big
pans all of them amazing they really
cater to everyone's tastes which i love
like they had that sweet smile and it
was kind of a purple undertones which i
think would look phenomenal on like
darker skins but then they also brought
out their like moon child one for those
that are slightly more adventurous with
makeup i feel like they just came for
everyone so they're definitely my kind
of highlighters my high-end highlighters
of the year and another brand that
smashed it with their highlighting
palettes was sleek again firstly with
their solstice one I feel like that
literally made everything take off for
them but then they bought up the
Cleopatra's kiss one which I do slightly
prefer and I love just because it's
slightly more of wearable tones for me
personally but yeah I formula of these
is absolutely incredible if you've never
tried it go into your local super drug
boots wherever that sells sleek and just
swatch them there so like I let me show
you they're just the most gorgeous kind
of champagne e
golden highlights and I'm obsessed them
I wear them on my eyes wear them on my
face there's like the sleek highlighting
palettes definitely a standout product
on it
you browse I think a lot of people might
think maybe anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow something which I love but I
have loved them for years and it was
only in 2016 I think benefit reeked of
branded their whole brow products and
they would definitely the standout ones
for me in particular their pencils I
love their goof Bru goof proof brow
pencil and their precise one I've been
loving them recently and you guys have
been loving the way that I do my brows
and it's because of them and yeah I've
really rediscovered or like discovered
their brow products in 2016 and I'm
obsessed with them and you they're not
too expensive either I know they're in
like the high-end Beauty category but
then really not breaking the bank I feel
like they last a really long time as
well so many people bought out such
phenomenal brow pencils but these really
stood out for me as for a drugstore brow
product I didn't really try any
drugstore brow pencils they've never
ever really been for me I always say
they're just slightly too warm but what
I have been loving is the Loreal brow
artist plumper gel in the like lighter
one over 2016 I loved having a slightly
darker brow and running a lighter
brauche L through it I thought it made
my brows look a lot more 3d a lot more
fuller which is always something I want
to achieve and yet I really liked this
one and it is the l'oreal one the brow
artist plumper for mascara my favorite
high-end mascara has to be the tarte
artist mascara i'm obsessed with it i
yet discovered it on the trip well i
went on with tarte which was obviously
one of the highlights of my 2016 as well
and it is amazing it's got one of my
favorite kind of types hold on one of my
favorite types of ones in the sense that
it's got like a spiky wand so for people
like me that have kind of naturally
shorter lashes it really lengthens them
it really separates them and it kind of
avoid some being super clumpy so i loved
that one and again my favorite drugstore
mascaras have to come from Maybelline I
am obsessed I feel like they have a
mascara for everyone whether you've got
the lashes up to your eyes and you just
want something light
I hope they cater for that and for
people like me that have shorter lashes
like I said I feel like they cater for
that they have so so so many and some
two that I picked up I know I'm obsessed
with their colossal one and also their
falsies push-up one I love that one for
my lower lash
as well I wanted to pick up some kind of
like eyeshadows even though I have got
palettes as well but the two eyeshadows
that kind of stood out for me I don't
know if they count as high-end but it's
just a brand I know you can't get in a
drugstore so I'm going to say that
they're high-end
i rave about these so much and I never
hear anyone talk about them but Neve
cosmetics pigments are incredible they
have so many colors they've got matte
ones they've got shimmery ones obviously
my favorite is the first I always get
the name wrong the sales for sale for
Sai or something I know it's after a
country but or a city or something but I
can never pronounce it it's most
gorgeous like coppery color I'm obsessed
with them I can't really about them
enough I'm going to link them down below
definitely give them a chance in 2017
and my drugstore eyeshadow favorites are
the NYX prismatic eyeshadows this one is
in particular liquid gold I feel like
they're so buttery and so pigmented and
for single eyeshadows I feel like that's
quite rare sometimes they can be rude
with especially with shimmery ones it
can be quite hard to get pigment from I
feel like NYX really stepped up with
their eyeshadows on the two lips I
really didn't even know where to start
I feel like I tried so so many lip
products over 2017 and it really was the
kind of year of like the liquid lipstick
and all that stuff so I just tried to
narrow it down to stuff I know that I've
reached for all the time so my drugstore
option has to be the slope and Glory and
mother pucker lip glosses I love lip
plumping glosses and I feel like these
nude ones are just the best I have the
one donor and spun sugar hair they're
two of my favorites ever like I wear
them day to day it's I could go to nude
gloss that I know is going to look
beautiful on my lips
one day maybe me and soap &amp;amp; Glory can
collab and produce like a Rachel nude
lip gloss from their mother pucker range
because I literally like I read about
these to everyone and the high end lip
product brand or like products that I've
loved have been from jouer
they bought out they're soft like lip
creams and the one in buff is such a
gorgeous pinky nude I'm obsessed and
obviously their skinny dip lip topper
has been like I thought I'd get started
the whole trend of everyone else that
bought them out I think it's incredible
such an amazing idea and I think 2016
was definitely their year for lip
products so I
loved them as well and finally eyeshadow
palettes I just took a long time to
decide but I think for me my drugstore
eyeshadow palette of the year was the
NYX what was this like the warm neutrals
ultimate eyeshadow palette they brought
out loads of ultimate eyeshadow palettes
in loads of different colors which I
thought was amazing this one is just so
good for traveling the eyeshadows are so
pigmented the colors are right up my
street I'm not sure if they do them
anymore they might have been exclusive
to Selfridges I'm not sure but in 2016
when I saw this I was like that is a
pallet for me and I love it and I reach
for it all the time but I need to do
like a quick look they've got such
beautiful matte shades in there am i
high and I should have had up the year I
was tossing out between two one of them
was the Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette but then I just kind
of dipped out and I went for the Tarte
swamp Queen palette and I think loads of
you might be like what haven't seen you
really use that but I've reach for this
so much and I treasure it so much I know
it's quite hard to get hold of but it
just has the most gorgeous colors in it
when I received this on the trip I
nearly screamed I've been dying to get
my hands on this for so so so long so
what I'd like treasure it forever and I
think their collaboration was in 2016 so
it only it seemed appropriate to put
this in there the colors are right on my
street has so many kind of colors to do
really quick look that make such a
statement so yeah this was my palette of
the year so that was a roundup of all my
Beauty kind of favorites and must-haves
over the past year I can't wait to see
the kind of products brands bring out
this year and what new trends is going
to be and all that stuff so maybe 2016
will be the year that I bring our
product no I mean 2017 hmm yeah I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video I've
given you suggestions of things to try

favorite or let me know in the comments
