wanted to do it something with a little
bit of color today but I'm not like that
adventures when it comes to makeup so I
wanted to shine with color that I was
comfortable with and I thought why not
do like a bold date night makeup look so
for me that was something that that's
super pretty super quick super easy and
you can kind of pair it with any sort of
bold lip I decide to go for like a pop
your pinks I kind of thought that was
flirty and romantic and I also you guys
on Twitter as well and loads of you said
like a hot pinky red so I really hope
you guys enjoy this I also kind of feel
like this is quite like an everyday full
makeup look too and it is September now
so I'm sure you can find somewhere for
this look in the video if it looks like
I'm naked I'm not I'm just wearing a
Bardot top just as an FYI if you like
the look of this makeup look already
then make sure to give it a thumbs up I
always leave all the products that I use
down below in terms of shades and
everything like that because normally
when I do like a voiceover I always
forget why view so I always just list it
down below if you are new then welcome
it to my channel make sure to hit that
subscribe button for more kind of makeup
related videos and all that good stuff
but without further ado if you like the
look of this makeup look then please
keep watching okay so to begin there's a
date night look by the way this is me
just proving to you I am wearing a top
and I've got crazy hair but I am gonna
mooster eyes my skin and I am using the
Mac strobe cream but this is the peach
light Edition so it has a slight reflex
of peach which I love and this is just
going to give us a gorgeous glow
underneath our foundation but we are
gonna go ahead and do our eyes first so
to pry my eyes I'm going to use the
concealer that I'm planning to use on my
face which is the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 2 so it's quite
close to my skin color and I always find
concealers make a really great base then
I always go ahead and set it with powder
for the eyes today I'm gonna use the Who
Dat beauty it desert dusk eyes shadow
palette I've been loving this at the
moment and I'm just gonna take the shade
Eden as our initial transition color
which is a really gorgeous kind of light
pale peachy orange it's actually more of
a peach even though on camera is coming
across as orange I promise you it has
slightly more like a pink tone to it but
we are only gonna be using like three of
the matte shades so I'm gonna go in with
this shade here this is called amber
it's a slightly a darker brown and I'm
just using that to at further deepen up
the crease and like I said we're only
gonna be using 3 gods like kind of
crease colors
just because we want to keep it quick
easy and minimal but still kind of look
really put together and I thought you
can achieve that with literally at just
three shadows and then I'm going back in
with my initial a fluffy brush just to
make sure that everything is a blended
seamlessly together to further and
finally it deepen up the crease I'm
taking that odd shade which is a really
gorgeous dark brown with a really nice
warm purpley undertone to it and I'm
just making sure to concentrate this on
the literally outermost part of the eyes
because we are gonna be doing a wing
today so I don't want to take it all the
way across I just want it to be kind of
like the outer gradient and for the lid
I'm taking the desert sand shade which
is like a matte cream I wanted to keep
it kind of matte on the eyes initially
and then I thought you know what I'm
gonna be having a matte lip and I want
there to be like some attention on the
eyes so I'm gonna go in with glitter B
you can totally keep this matte hair if
you want and keep it as like yeah a
matte kind of cream shadowed look but
then I'm going back in with that brush
that we used to apply the second
transition shade and going kind of side
to side motions and I find that's the
way I get the best blend so you can see
everything kind of fades nicely into
each other and then like I said I kind
of wanted a little bit of glitter and
this is Mac reflexive gold I loved their
reflex critters every time I use them I
feel like I always rave about them
they're just such a subtle Sparkle and
like I said I'm just applying a little
bit of glitter glue down beforehand and
then just pressing it on and I think
this is a mac 242 brush which I love to
apply glitter and pigments because they
don't pick up too too much product and
they just kind of Pat it on nicely and
I'm just gonna highlight my inner corner
using the highlighter that I plan to use
so you will see that later on in the
video and then just taking a wipe and it
cleaning up the eye shadow that's like
my favorite part and I kind of just kind
of aim towards the end of my eyebrow to
kind of give me a guidance of how the
angle wait how the angle how I want the
angle to go and then for eyeliner I've
been loving this one this is the wire
cell catcher eyeliner in the shade one I
think it's literally just their plain
back one but the bristles on the brush
are so like firm you get such a precise
point with it but I'm a little bit of a
perfectionist when it comes to eyeliner
so I always like to clean up with a wipe
and now I'm just gonna go ahead and
apply mascara and if you don't feel
confident wearing lashes you can
obviously just leave it here I love the
like volume that this mascara produces
so yeah like I said feel free to leave
it here but I love these lashes these
are from flutter lashes and then
in the style tamanna I just think
they're super sup what my god what am I
saying I'm smart a super subtle
and fluttery but yeah I'm gonna go ahead
and do my brows I've left the products
down below and for primer using the NYX
first base primer spray cuz I'm lazy

and then for foundation I'm using two
shades it's a L'Oreal True Match and
then mixing in at this like a liquid
bronzer for Matt bourgeois cuz I really
wanted the skin to look like fresh and
glowy and not too full coverage and I
love the coverage of the too much like I
said it's like a really natural
buildable finish and just blending that
in with a Beauty Blender and then I'm
using my Maybelline fit me concealer in
the shade two same one that we used for
the primer on our eyes and just like to
take up on this sides of my nose to give
a subtle contour but then yeah just
taking it underneath my eyes and all the
kind of places that I like to highlight
and then I'm just buffing that out with
a oh my god what is this brush called
it's from Sigma I want to say it's like
an F 60 something brush but it's like a
tapered kabuki brush so yeah the Sigma
tapered kabuki brush and then I just
like to use my sponge to make sure it's
all pressed in I'm gonna go ahead and
set everything with powder and we can go
back onto the eyes and just using that
initial Eden shade on a pencil brush
underneath our eyes just to kind of tie
it all together and connect everything
up and then I'm using my favorite
favorite eyeliner this is the amarka
Beauty high liner in the shade sunset
just for like I don't know I feel like
my eyes look a bit more like sexier when
there's something in the mood sign and
then just apply mascara and these other
finished eyes moving on to the face I'm
taking the Too Faced dark chocolate
Soleil bronzer just to warm up my
collection complexion and yeah just add
a bit of a contour as well and just yeah
warm everything up because I was really
quite pound on my body and the
foundation wasn't actually dark enough I
kind of looked a bit pale so this is
just gonna help warm everything up and
just kind of add a bit more contour and
definition to our face and then I'm
taking this a blush up from the two at
phase two sweet peach palette just what
a really gorgeous peach ago you can see
it's super subtle and yeah I love the
glow that this creates and dipping into
an old favorite i'm using the anastasia
beverly hills ultimate glow kit and just
dabbling my brush in a few of the shades
to create like my perfect highlighter
shade and I'm just taking it above my
brow as well and just like
my brows on my Cupid's bow but an
all-over glow I love the colors in this
palette I think they're so natural
especially when you mix them all
together now onto the lip I'm it taking
it this NYX suede matte lip liner in the
shade san paulo sao paolo something like
that it's basically just a Matt ha pink
and then for the liquid lipstick I'm
gonna be taking the colour-pop ultra
matte lipstick in the shade Tuesday I
don't think it's limited edition if it's
not I will have listed it down below I
just think this is such a gorgeous shade
of like a fuchsia but it's almost not
too bright it's almost like a really
gorgeous hybrid between pink and red and
I thought this was just perfect and
romantic and actually kind of full
appropriate and then I'm just setting
everything in place with the cover
effects illuminating setting spray I
just kind of paired it with a Bardot top
and a flirty updo and this is the
finished look so I really hope you guys

it a thumbs up and subscribe if you

next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
