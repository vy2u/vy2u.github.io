today we are going to be doing a bronzed
glowing summer skin routine these are
just some of the steps that I take not
necessarily just the summer maybe if I'm
going out or just want my skin it to
look it's really and best just to kind
of really give me that JLo bronze
blowing vibe we've got body makeup going
on a few products and techniques in here
that are just kind of extra steps I take
to make sure that everything is poppin
and I'm looking around baby obviously
you can switch out the colors and the
intensity of each product that I apply
to be able to suit you - so you can
achieve your level of like summer
bronzed looking skin I've left the names
and the links to everything down below
but if you are loving the look of this
skin so far make sure to give me a
thumbs up it really helps me and shows
your support and lets me know that you

that subscribe button and make sure the
notification bell is on because on this
channel we do do notification Bell
shout-out so if you get the Bell and you

then let me know in the comment section
down below because then I can shut you
out so this week's a notification about
shoutout goes to Alice Mia makeup that
says a notification bell on as always
love your channel keeps laying gal much
love much love to you Alice thank you so
much for letting me know but without
further ado you will know what products
are used and how to achieve this bronze
glowing some appropriate skin then
please keep watching
okay so to begin our we're gonna start
by prepping our skin now this it's like
a key ingredient in order to get that
glowing ask it all about in the base
products that you use even starting from
your skincare so literally one of my
all-time at favorite moisturizers to use
if I know I want to get like blowing
some bronzing looking skin is Mac strobe
cream now I know they do these in a good
few colors I'm gonna be taking the shade
at gold like it has the most gorgeous
pearlescent finish to it I love this
underneath makeup and the smell oh my
god it's so like nostalgic to mix used
to work at Mac but honestly I just love
it so much and I love the way this wears
under foundation so I'm just gonna work
this into my skin I'm just using my
fingers today because why not I just
feel like it and also with this is
actually I think a part of their prep
and the prime range and it always has a
slight tack to it and for me that kind
of implies that it is gonna work really
well under your makeup and during the
summer when it's really hot and stuff
you want your makeup to last as long as
it possibly can so anything that has
like a slight tack to it you know it's
gonna work really well but just because
you want like super glowing skin don't
kind of overload it if that makes sense
so with every step of your base routine
that don't feel like it has to be
something glowing something glowing
something going something glowing
because otherwise your makeup probably
isn't gonna last as long as you want it
to so if a primer I'm going to be taking
the Porefessional primer from a benefit
but it is the pearl ish version I have
tried this before I love the way this
looks but I am kind of going for a more
flawless effect with this rather than a
glowing effect the glowing effect will
come from the moisturizer so I'm gonna
be using this today but I do like to use
a brush to apply my primer is I'm not
really sure why I just always do I feel
like it works a lot better yeah like I
said that doesn't really I know it's
called pearl I don't do that I'd never
really used the original benefit
Porefessional primer so I don't know the
difference I don't know it's just called
pearl because it's like a pink tone but
this doesn't give a huge glow this just
really helps to fill out your pores and
create a really really a flawless and
base so I would pick one or the other
when it comes to prepping your skin
either have maybe like a moisturize that
you know and love works with your skin
and makes it 30 self and then going in
with like a dewy
primer type thing
or vice-versa like I'm doing this way I
just find more effective with my skin
tone and works okay once that is done we
can move on to foundation I've used this
a few times recently in honesty I just
keep reaching for it if I know I want
like a medium a buildable coverage and a
really gorgeous like satin looking glow
to the skin the fact is from L'Oreal and
it is so affordable also makes this
amazing because I can be repurchasing it
all summer long so this is the Loreal
Pro glow foundation I think it actually
for us people in the UK is only
available on Amazon right now I have
left the link to it down below I don't
know if it's gonna be a permanent Amazon
exclusive or if it's actually coming
back to you know Superdrug but
everything else is sold fingers crossed
but yeah I love this this is a this has
a radiant finish for normal to dry skin
and it's super super hydrating
everything that you want throughout the
summer obviously people get a little bit
scared with like satin finish
foundations and it's gonna last whatever
if you've got the correct base and you
set everything correctly you should have
no problems with foundations like this
maybe if you have oily skin do stick to
a matte foundation or really just make
sure everything is set with your best
translucent mattifying powder and then
you can always go and add to glow back
in with other products honestly I love
this I've raved about this all the time
I think I use it literally in my tubbing
or I'm going out get ready with me the
previous video this was the foundation
that I use yeah I just love the finish
of this and it's so buildable and it
says up to 24-hour wear which is perfect
in my opinion now a little tip I know it
always looks weird on camera if I'm
applying what appears to be a really
dark foundation and that you're looking
at my face thinking oh my god the color
of that it's not your color love another
honestly when I was working at Matt we
used to do this technique where if you
kind of apply a darker foundation to
your face but then use a really bright
concealer underneath your eyes but use
the same tools to kind of blend
everything out you get this most
gorgeous like bronze radiant finish and
it really really doesn't look as like
dramatic as I'm making it sound and that
is what I do like to do I do like to
wear a darker foundation than my natural
skin tone I promise you in person I
don't look ridiculous I make sure to
blend out and it looks super natural you
never go out the house not looking my
color or making sure that I wasn't you
know blended right or the color was
right I would never do that
so I know on camera you might think the
first step like when I'm applying it
right now you're thinking like what but
I promise you I always make it work make
it's work I know my techniques and I
know what looks good on me
with concealer I don't tend to pick like
anything that really implies the super
radiant finish for my concealer because
underneath my eyes is just very specific
I feel like it's like that for a lot of
people I just want the coverage I don't
really care about the finish or anything
like that so I'm gonna just going to be
using the revolution conceal and define
concealer I love this again super
affordable it's only like four pounds
and I'm making sure to pick a shade that
is a lot lighter than the foundation so
it's really gonna help brighten
having a brighter under eye and having a
bronzed perimeter again is another way
to make sure that you're going to be
looking kind of super bronzed and
radiant through the summer it makes such
a difference
I swear so I'm just gonna be taking this
sponge I always get a lot of questions
about this bunch it's from Maybelline I
got it when I was in the US and I have
no idea if it's available in the UK or
not if it is I'm gonna make sure to find
it but honestly I definitely reach this
over my Beauty Blender it when you get
it really damp it is so soft I'm
obsessed with it and it has so many kind
of different shapes to it I use the
tapered side of my concealer they're
like rounded bottom for my foundation
even though I used a brush today but
pending on what a foundation I use I use
the bottom of this sponge for that yeah
I love the combination of these two
together almost the moisture from the
foundation really helps to blend out
this concealer because this is
definitely more of a matte full coverage
concealer and he C it really helps to
lighten up my skin the way I'm blending
it out
so my foundation doesn't appear so dark
I love that concealer so much it's so
good just like giving you amazing
coverage and not feeling it too heavy on
the skin it's honestly will be one of my
Holy Grail concealers for lad okay
moving on I feel like the way to get
bronzy satiny summer amazing looking
skin is to kind of stick with creamy
products so I'm gonna be doing a cream
contour today and what I've been
reaching for the most again super
affordable you guys maybe I should have
call this like a drugstore
there's some items in here that are
necessary that aren't drugstore I feel
like this is super affordable anyway
this is it the revolution of fast base
foundation stick and this is in the
shade F 13 so it would be obviously and
all over face stick for someone with a
darker complexion but I'm loving these
for cream contour and they have such an
extensive foundation range that I feel
like anyone of any like ends of the
spectrum
would be able to find one for
highlighting and contouring as well as
their like whole base colors so I think
this is so good they're so affordable as
well it's only a fiver like I said this
is the color F 13 which I've been loving
for a cream contour and I just think the
blend is a lot more natural with creams
you avoid that cakey looking feeling and
yeah it just looks a lot more natural on
the skin which is what we want we don't
want anything to powder than Kate
because that doesn't give me that like
summer vibes you know everything just
needs to look light you just kind of
rolled out of bed and the Bahamas and
it's like oh yeah this is what I look
like so I'm just gonna blend that and
I'm just using a duo fiber brush for
this but these blend so good into the
skin and you also want to make sure that
you're not blending like down because
you don't want your cheekbones to look
sunken you want them to look lifted
sculpted like you've been to kiss
aesthetics you know what I'm saying so
let's just go ahead and blend you can
see that just like blend so easily into
the skin I love it and I've made sure to
pick one that's just like not too too
dark because then the blend never looks
as like you know natural you-let's you
just want to create this like bronzed
kind of like gradient nothing too
dramatic cuz you can always add that in
with like powder bronzes and stuff you
just want the creams to blend as
naturally as they can so then they
appear to look you know appear to look
the most natural so that's kind of all
the creams that we're going to be doing
for now
I'm now gonna go ahead and powder my
skin now I don't want the power to be
too heavy I don't want to look powdered
I just want to set everything in place
and the product I've been using it
recently that gives me that kind of soft
focus flawless finish that you would
have seen in that little clip that I
inserted like on like Twitter and on my
Instagram stories kind of showing you
the skin is from a beauty bakery it is
there better not bitter flower setting
powder but this is the color yellow and
I feel like I don't want it like to bake
and might be brighten or everything I
just kind of want to set everything in
place looks super natural but still get
like a bronzed vibe coming through and I
just find that I get that with this
yellow powder and I don't know what it
is about Beauty bakery powders I've got
the translucent one as well they just
make you look like there is a filter on
you permanently it just gives the most
gorgeous soft finish it doesn't look too
cakey at all I don't know if it's just
like the way that it's been milled or
whatever but the first time using their
translucent powder and I was like in
love with the way that looked
and then I've always seen makeup artists
like the pro anyway makeup artist like
they always use yellow powders so I
thought why not I'll just get a yellow
one I'll just test it out whatever cuz
banana powders they're big in the beauty
industry for a reason but I've never
really you know used them myself so I
thought I would get this and honestly I
cannot stop using it on obsessed with
the finish I'm just kind of pressing it
into the skin and really focusing on the
area's I know kind of sweat a lot so
maybe like my upper lip or like around
my forehead I just like can't you see it
just looks like filtered I'm obsessed
with that powder I've linked it down
below because I know it's available on
beautybay and I feel like you should be
having a sale right now so definitely
check it out it is the Beauty bakery at
flour powder in yellow now this is the
stage that I would normally do my brows
I'm gonna go ahead and do them off
camera because there's nothing you know
that I do differently for summer brows
or anything like that I'm just gonna go
ahead and use whatever I've got here but
choose my Anastasio beverly hills
dipbrow and dark brown to do my brows
and then I'll be back to finish off this
summer skin look oh great
Brow's are done we can now continue now
I know I said I prefer the look of a
cream bronzer but sometimes I feel like
it can get a little bit lost and I do
still want to look as old and slightly
contoured so I'm going to take the
Nippon fab at bronze to palette and take
the two matte shades at the top and mix
them together I'm not really using this
to bronze as such more just to kind
Rhian Hance what was already there and
give us a more like chiseled look so I'm
just going over gonna where I put the
cream you can see it's not really adding
too much color it's almost just bringing
back the color that was there that might
have got lost maybe slightly just cuz of
the powdering but I'm also gonna use
just kind of what's left on the brush to
do my nose around my jaw like so now I'm
gonna go in with a blusher and again
this isn't one that has a super shimmer
to it because I like my shimmer to come
up from I kind of like my highlighter
and a shimmery bronzer which I can't
wait to show in a minute so she's like
my favorite product ever but this is the
L'Oreal life's a peach blush I love a
peachy blush in the summertime plus this
smells literally amazing and I just love
the color of it it's not too too much it
just really adds a gorgeous flush of
peach to your skin peach to me is more
kind of summery and more natural just
apply that to my cheeks guys are my
jumper too okay so this next product is
for me what I think transforms it into
JLo skin whenever I do makeup on my
friends or anything like that
this is just kind of like the final or
like the deciding step that literally
just transforms skin I'm not even joking
so this is the a beauty bakery
illuminator so I see and I think this is
in the color like glazed or something
it's the most gorgeous like bronze color
and what I do is just take a big kind of
rounded powder brush I kind of put some
product in the lid and kind of like tap
it in tap it off and then just go round
and I'm gonna zoom you in off this you
can pre see but this honestly this is
like the bronze goddess moment like I
wouldn't be surprised if this is what
JLo uses like all over her body it's the
most natural like golden brown
so obviously out
a bit of like a bronze - but then it's
like the most gorgeous like gold reflux
that blends into your skin so much so
that it looks like it's part of your
skin and I've always kind of put this
everywhere actually I'm gonna put
something else on and then put that on
over the top when it comes to my bloody
done this is almost gonna act just like
our base highlight because we obviously
are gonna go in with a more gold
iridescent highlight but this just kind
of acts as like that inner glow it gives
you that inner glow which I'm obsessed
with if you go a little overboard just
dusting your foundation brush over the
top just kind of almost neutralizes it
slightly but it is still that honesty I
don't go anywhere without that shimmery
bronze that it literally just goes it
takes me from feeling a bit like and
like flat on my makeup just looking at
it - it literally like bringing me to
life I'm obsessed with that stuff and
again they haven't abused me at the
moment and I've linked it down below so
the final step is gonna be highlighting
and my trick to getting like a popping
highlight that lasts all evening is to
use a cream and almost like a loose
powder highlighter but this is actually
an eyeshadow pigment cream highlighter
I'm going to be using is that Anastasio
Beverly Hills liquid glow in a peach
fears I love this color it's not too
pale it's not too dark - really gorgeous
Goldy peachy warm vibe and it blends
into the skin amazing the end you can
see some people I feel like get a little
bit scared when it comes to applying
creams back onto a powdered skin so what
I'm gonna do is just literally apply a
couple of drops there a couple of drops
then I'm just gonna take this brush this
is from blank canvas cosmetics is that a
13 it's like a little fluffy brush and
just pop to dispense drag down to kind
of create and then buff to blend I'm
just applying this to the tops of my
cheekbones and little dragging motions
around the edge to make sure it's really
blended out and then it was what's left
I kind of just take it up a bit onto my
forehead you can see it really hasn't
separated with the powders or anything
like that I'm being so light handed with
and as well and with the application to
make sure that I'm not gonna be
separating it so you can see I just drag
it down to kind of create that you know
highlight bar shape almost and then a
buff around the edges to make sure it's
diffused into our skin there's no like
harsh lines and like obvious placement
okay and now we applied that cream if
you want just leave it there leave it
there but I want to be blinding people
into like summer 19 so I'm gonna go in
with a loose powder highlighter and this
is the pigment from the bomber called
know what money and no wait no no money
no honey or no honey no money something
like that I'm just gonna be taking a
little tapered highlighting brush so we
can get really precise there's my
favorite one from zueva at the moment
I'm gonna be placing this directly on
the top and the loose pigment from the
highlighter should really cling it to
that cream highlighter and just like
you'll see I'm just saying it just looks
so smooth and buttery on your skin and
blends so nicely this is that moment
when you turn to the side and I'm just
obsessed now to kind of finish
everything off I actually I'm gonna be
so upset the day that this runs out
because I love this this is the iconic
London like prep set glow spray and this
is the like glow shade this is the one
that has like that bronze finish trip I
promise you that doesn't actually try
and stay on to the face it just has a
different finish to it which is really
glowy which is why you saw everyone kind
of spraying their body with it but I'm
using this on my face and let me tell
you the way that this applies the smell
the finish everything I'm just obsessed
with it I've linked it down below if you
guys if you want to get it to try
because I promise you this is just gonna
change your life and also another little
tip while your face is still slightly
wet if you pick up again tiny bit of
extra highlighter I'm just gonna mix
it's dried slightly but while your skin
is still a little bit wet
just on the highest points to give it
that extra pop it's the final step I'm
going to take is not my face but on my
body just because one I've been dying to
use this on camera and show you and two
I feel like you just kind of will tie
everything together especially if this
is gonna be your summer kind of body
phase glowing makeup routine you guys
know in my favorites video I said that
you could create your own kind of body
glowing mist by taking a bit of a fix
plus it almost looks like it looks like
this but this one actually does
translate a bit of glitter because I've
put a bronzing kind of refined glitter
pigment in it to create that color and
glow
if you douse your body and this I
promise you you won't be disappointed
and the fact that it's fixed plus means
that it's gonna kind of stick to your
body as well so just be spraying this
all over your legs your titties your
chest whatever and this gonna give you
an amazing glow too but if you wanna be
extra like me and you manage together I
picked up the effective beauty of brown
sugar body lava and I'm just gonna put
this on up here
just to kind of show you well looks like
and just to tie everything together and
really complete this summer bronzy
glowing skin tutorial I didn't pick up
her exact kabuki brush I just picked I
just got one from like it cosmetics I'm
just gonna blend this in Rihanna has got
the smell of her products on a point
because this smells so good too as you
can see but this is the finished summer
bronzy skin oh I love it so this is the
finished skin tutorial I really hope you
