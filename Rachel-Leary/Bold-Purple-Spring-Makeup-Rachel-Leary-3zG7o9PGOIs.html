first of all I'm doing my brows using my
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow then
prepping my skin with mac's fix+ and
then using the nyx angel veil primer
just as a base i haven't used this one
in ages and i actually really like it it
reminds me of l'oreal lumi magique but
it's not as luminous it's got quite a
matte finish
then for foundation I'm mixing my
Bourjois healthy mix and my NARS all day
luminous just cuz I really like the
combination of these two together cuz
the color I have in the NARS one is a
bit too yellow for me but the bourgeois
ones almost too neutral so I really like
to mix them together to get the color
that I want then going onto eyes I've
already prepped my eyes with concealer
and loose powder then it taking the
anastasia beverly hills artist palette
and taking this color which is dusty
rose as the initial transition shade as
something just really neutral but still
has like a purple undertone to it then
taking the single shadow from sugarpill
in the color to am on this fluffy brush
i'm just taking that into the crease and
then building up the kind of color
intensity that I want layer by layer but
making sure it's all really softly
blended together so I'm going back in
with the original fluffy brush that we
use with the dusty rose and just kind of
buffing out any harsh lines then I'm
taking this pressed pigment from Aden
see in in the color Royale and I learned
the first time from when I did my other
eye that the fall out and this was
really bad on my foundation so I am
putting a tissue down there just to
catch any fallout even though this still
is gonna be a bit messy it just kind of
helps it be a bit less now see that
makes sense then I'm going back in with
the same fluffy brush and the two am i
shadow and just blending the crease
colors and the lid color together
for a bit of sparkle I'm taking the
makeup heat sparklet and zodiac and
spraying my brush and my eye beforehand
with fix+ just to act as an adhesive and
then just pressing that on top of
basically where we'd put the ardency in
shadow on the lid going back in with the
artist palette i'm mixing aubergine and
blue velvet together just to deepen up
the socket on a really precise fluffy
crease brush I think then I'm just
taking a clean fluffy brush and really
really is softening out the edges here
I'm just taking my foundation brush and
just cleaning up any of the mess that we
made underneath just to make sure
obviously that was not going to be left
with any fallout then moving on to eyes
to finish them off I'm just apply
mascara and these lashes from mosquito
they are in the style black magic and
they are my absolute favorite for round
eyes then at taking the NYX HD concealer
in the shade number 4 I think and you
can use the concealer to kind of shape
your eyeshadow look that you want so
kind of helps doing your foundation at
first just as a tip in this one as well
and then I'm taking my Real Techniques
sponge and blending it out as usual
to brighten and sir I'm taking my
hourglass ambient lighting powder in
diffused light as always and just
pressing that underneath my eye with my
Sigma tapered powder brush
to finish up under the eye I'm taking
the same - am i shallow from sugarpill
and just running that underneath my eye
really smoking out just because when I
was doing this look it was getting
really like dark and sultry so I thought
I'm gonna really smoke up my lower
lashline with this purple and then going
back in with the aubergine on a flat
definer brush I'm using that just
pressing it against my lower lashline to
kind of add to the intensity and
smokiness of the lower lash line then
just apply my favorite bottom lash
mascara at the moment which is from
L'Oreal false lash and just highlighting
with any sort of like powder shade and
this is the finished eye look moving a
back on to the skin I am it taking the
bourgeois golden bronzer just gonna
fluff the cheek brush as per usual and
just using that to bronze up and warm up
all around my face
for blush I'm using this one from NARS
called satellite of love which is a
really sparkly mouth color I don't want
anything to paint to kind of draw
attention away from the purple on the
eyes so I thought kind of mouth goes
with that dusty rose kind of that we
used earlier and then highlighting my
cheekbones with the Anastasia Beverly
Hills highlighter in so Hollywood and
that is the skin complete and then
moving on to the lips I asked you guys
to tweet me your options and I got so
many mixed out I did include all three
of the ones I said so this is Lime Crime
Kashmir a kind of cool tone nude then we
have a dark one which is steel I think
it's shiny
tryam tea I'm not sure and then stealer
caramel out for your classic nude I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did
and I will see you in the next one bye
guys no more of the grass innocent are
