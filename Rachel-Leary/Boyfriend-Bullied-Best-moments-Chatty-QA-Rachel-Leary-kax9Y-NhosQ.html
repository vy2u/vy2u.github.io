it's a slightly different background
today I did say what I do my kind of
more Sunday videos I wanted to make them
a bit more chatty a bit more relaxed so
I'm just in my bedroom and today I asked
you guys to ask some questions on
Instagram for a Q&amp;amp;A about anything and I
thought this would be a good way if you
guys to start getting to know me a bit
better I'm rich I say this in most
journeys but like you can always get to
know someone a bit better so I'm just
going to go through and answer some
other questions that you ask me it's
over like 200 so I might not be able to
answer all of them but I will do the
best I can
excuse me I feel that I come across a
bit down I am in a bit of a bad mood but
I mean it's just one of those days it's
a Sunday the weather's been so like
today it's just not been great so excuse
me for that and the men will make up
although you guys do requests that you
guys don't think I need to be wearing as
much makeup as I do so I'm sure you
might appreciate a slightly better face
but yeah so I'm just gonna go ahead and
go through and answer some of your
questions
Jordan underscore Adams asks advice for
new youtubers but like this is a
question that like everyone always wants
to know the answer to as in like say for
anyone that's gonna ask me or has asked
me about like starting YouTube and how
to start and stuff like that because I
definitely know that I've seen a few
questions like that already I think it's
just make sure you know what you want to
post videos about if you're going in
with it thinking oh I want to do YouTube
videos so I can get followers and get
sent stuff and stuff like that but like
I just don't know what to post like
object that's just the worst mindset to
go into and to start with because that's
not the purpose of YouTube you choose a
place and a platform for people to post
videos about stuff that they're
passionate about or stuff that they find
interesting so once you know what it is
that you're passionate about and what
you want to start posting videos about
content will just keep coming and that's
how you do gain like subscribers and
stuff like that because people see that
you're genuinely passionate about what
you want to do
and that's what people like to watch
they like to see someone being like
passionate and genuine about what
they're talking about and stuff like
that so I just say advice for posting
your video would be make sure you know
what you want to start posting videos
about be consistent and yourself and
just enjoy it if you're not having fun
then you won't want to post videos and
you just won't grow as a channel media
dot gris-gris see greg ooh sorry if I
got that wrong how did you discover your
passion for makeup I think I just used
to watch those of people on YouTube all
the time and just I just love how it can
transform you I know that sounds really
cheesy or like weird to say I mean it
totally transforms my mood I know like
if I'm feeling really down or in a bad
mood making myself look better which I
feel like I can do with makeup makes me
in a better mood and just doing makeup
on other people and seeing them like
look in the mirror and be like oh my god
like I look so different I mean you like
it there that's one thing I just love
how it can really transform you as a
person I'm going to give me to a bad
mood or like looking like I know I look
totally different with no makeup on it's
like a full face I just love how much
like fun you can have with it as well
like I just think it's the best thing
ever
obviously Sarah swanee asks what camera
and lens do I use I use my sony a5100
myth but I'm looking into getting a new
lens when I do my makeup tutorials and
stuff like that that it's gonna like
really blare out my background and just
make things look a bit more professional
stuff like that I don't use a giant DSLR
I'm used to you and then I got this one
and the quality was almost better so I
just used this one for like my Instagram
pictures and filming on it to Williams
underscore Tasha XS what was your first
video on YouTube and were you nervous
about filming my first video on YouTube
was a Halloween tutorial and it's me
Brizzy sped up with like thunder and
lightning in the background is my music
and it's like a wearable witch or
something like that
it makes me laugh so much everytime like
watching I am watched it I might watch
like once
twice since posting it but it just makes
me laugh how much videos have changed
since that one but I feel like
everyone's first video is something to
like definitely keep forever on your
chap on your channel so you can really
see how much you believe like grown and
developed because it's quite funny I
know I'm not sure I pronounce and I am
hey Nev dot dad forage says what was
your school experience like and it was
okay uh from about year 7 to year 11 I
look like I belonged in Lord of the
Rings dad let me know like school is a
bit of a weird time for me in the sense
that definitely in my last few years I
felt really disliked by most of my
llegu√© I always got the blame for a lot
of things and I got voted like bad
things in my yearbook and stuff like
that so I don't know up until then and
like I'd have a pretty decent school
experience I was never really like
bullied or anything like that if that's
the kind of thing that you're like
wondering yeah my school experience was
average no luck under school
Castro says how successful did you think
that your YouTube was going to be before
it became so successful um not at all I
posted videos at first because I have I
did like photography and stuff at school
so I had a passion for like I had a
passion for editing and getting angles
right and stuff like that and I had a
passion for makeup so I kinda just put
the two and two together and a lot of
people would always ask me about makeup
say oh how did you do that and then
there can you do my makeup myself at
that so I think I just put two and two
together and thought if people want to
know then maybe more people want to know
and I'll just post videos and I had
absolutely no idea it would take off as
much as it has I'm honestly really
grateful for all of you so thank you
Chloe makeup says do you have a
boyfriend
and do you live with your parents or on
your own have a great day
you too no I don't have a boyfriend I'm
single
yep and do you live with your parents
yes I live with my parents but I do I
think maybe this year next year when I
move out either in my hometown or to
London off on my back so I have a lot of
meetings and stuff like that up in
London so it would make sense
Lucy Dan Scott says how do you get over
a breakup I just had one and I'm finding
it hard I've never been in a serious
relationship to have a really dramatic
breakup and know what it's like I've had
friends go through it and I've seen what
happens to them and I've been through
situations where I've been really upset
about something that's ended but I mean
it wasn't like really serious but I was
just really like attached and stuff like
that but I'm probably the worst person
to ask and if any of my friends are
watching
they'll probably agree I'm very to the
point and I don't have a lot of time or
effort for people or for myself I could
get quite angry at myself if I dwell on
things or if I get really emotional
about something like I'm just a very not
I don't to say hotness cuz I do care
about a lot of things and I do get
really upset but I don't I don't show it
really I'd rather come across as lung
and cold and just act as if I don't care
then to let people know that I'm really
upset so if you're dealing with a
breakup and it's really hard I'd be the
kind of person to tell you to just
delete them from everything like
distract yourself do something else
don't dwell on it don't talk to them
like I can because I could do that I
could just shut someone out if they've
really upset me or something like that I
I just don't see the point in dwelling
on something and getting yourself upset
about it life is way too short to keep
being upset about something that I know
in a couple of months or however I'll be
alright I'll be okay I
can't give a huge amount of advice on
this because they've not been through it
personally but my advice is just to
distract yourself hang out with your
friends and just get rid of anything or
just cut connections that's not going to
remind you of them because otherwise
you're pretty we struggle
Chapman 2 to 4 says what are your goals
for 2016 2016 is to focus mainly on my
youtube and just really see where it can
take me and what it will lead to I want
to reach half a million subscribers
definitely feel like that's beyond think
about this moment in time but would be
an absolute dream come true and my like
goal of this channel like that's one
another goal and just yeah meet and
collab with other youtubers as well I
want to make the most of this platform
and make friends on did that do the same
sort of thing as me and yeah stuff like
that Nev O'Callahan sorry I don't know
that's how you pronounce it what
subjects did you take at GCSE and
a-level at GCSE I took photography
architecture geography do you take three
or four GCSEs
three got to pick and then you do all
the basic ones like maths English
science French stuff like that and then
for a levels I did maths geography art
and psychology and then in my second
year I dropped maths and only continued
on with photography and he continued on
with art psychology and geography
Kiley's and the sister says do you have
a boyfriend your favourite beauty
youtuber are you small or tall what do
you think about that even German girls
are watching your videos and what kind
of music you listen to okay I asked
because before no I don't have a
boyfriend I am single your favorite
beauty youtuber as in is this someone
that just posts beauty videos because if
it is then I think like nikkietutorials
or crispy either one of those two are
you small at all recently I think I've
shrunk I think I'm like 5 foot 5 though
which is like average height but
if I've shrunk or all my friends are
getting taller because when we're out I
just I'm looking up to everyone so I'm
average I love the fact that German
girls watch my videos and what kind of
music do you listen to music something
I'm so open to I'd listen to any type of
music at the moment I listen to the
weekend
Drake future but then I like Justin
Bieber
and now I've licked you on listen to
anything if someone wants to plug their
phones my car I'll happily listen to
whatever they want to listen to or
anything like that so yeah so but if I'm
basing off the people that I mentioned
I'd probably say like R&amp;amp;B Jaffa Jaffa
Jess says in a company cangjie that made
all make up products from brushes to
lipstick or highlighter etc and they
said you could do your own something
what would you do this is something I've
been really thinking about because
that's something that I do want to do
one day is bring out my own product of
some sort either in collaboration with a
brand and then maybe go on to bring out
my own line of stuff so if I was to
collaborate with a brand I think I would
have to be something signature to me or
that brand or something like that so
maybe I bring out a pair of lashes or
something like that I feel lashes are
something I wear all the time so I would
put my heart and soul into designing a
lash that is like my dream lash that I
would wear all the time that I would
want you guys to enjoy and share or
maybe it's a smokey eye kit is that make
sense so maybe like a kit you could buy
a pallet and eyeliner and a mascara like
type thing together so you could get
like a signature Rachel's smokey eye and
a palette I know I'm just thinking of
things or maybe like a fragrance I wear
a lot of perfume so I would love to
design my own fragrance I feel like
that's you guys don't might not know the
kind of smells that I like if you have
never met me in person you don't really
know I smell like all the time so it
might not be as meaningful to you guys
so who knows but it's something I think
about a lot what is your all-time
favorite
lipstick or liquid lipstick it's
probably too faced melted sugar or
Anastasia Beverly Hills pure Hollywood
or the NYX soft matte lip cream in Cairo
but I don't know if that's a liquid
lipstick 100 yeah there's my top three
oh X sab says at school should anyone
ever be rude or anything because of your
channel yeah I'd say so
I used to get told all the time that
people were bitching about it I I still
know people that bitch about it that I
just only kind of quite bitter about it
more than anything I understood a bit
more at school because no one else was
really doing it and it's quite like an
interesting what I could tell myself it
was because it was quite different and
quite interesting people wanted to know
about it so sometimes when people do
things that are kind of more out of the
box
people are negative about it because
they don't really understand but yeah
nowadays it's not so bad I mean I still
get it's more people ask any questions
or other than anything that because
they're just curious because they don't
understand rather than people being
brewed I know people are still still
rude still better but you just kind of
have to go with it Katie Lily Bryant
says what are your plans for the future
by the way if you guys didn't know katie
has a YouTube channel she's just started
hey Katie by the way she was um the
winner of my giveaway that I did a while
back and we've kind of chatted since
then and yeah she has a YouTube channel
called Katie Lilly makeup she's only got
one video up so far but I'll leave a
link to her channel down below so if you
guys could give her some love that would
be super cute yeah she says what are my
plans for the future so it's kind of
like my 2016 run birth for the future I
want to be focusing mainly on deaths
posting a lot more videos for you guys
taking it a lot more seriously and just
making the most of what can become of
this platform if that makes sense and
maybe one day have my own product and I
want to move out and travel and explore
a lot more meet more people
that's all things so I the
this year's gonna be a good one and I'll
finish on a question from Ricky Matt sue
I think which said what is the best
thing that has happened to you since you
started YouTube I think just my general
confidence has grown I find because a
lot of people that I technically don't
know come up and approach me I used to
struggle with like making conversation
and stuff like that and talking to
strangers but now since having this
YouTube and not knowing that a lot of
people watch me and they actually come
and approach me I feel my confidence as
a person has grown and my people skills
has got a lot better going like events
and just throwing myself in the deep end
and just having to talk to people that I
don't know and it's been really good for
me as well as I'm more sort of
self-aware as a person I know I'm sort
of going into some more personal things
because I'm probably sure you mean like
the best thing that's happened to me is
receiving like I think the best thing
that's happened for me personally is um
like growing as a person life I said the
best thing that's ever happened to me
since getting a YouTube channel was
reaching a hundred thousand subscribers
it was just something I never ever ever
thought would happen to me ever and
because of that so many other good
things come from it I feel like that
just was the tree trunk and then so many
branches just the best thing that's
happened to me is you guys and the
dedication and I'm literally talking a
load of lights or just rambling so
much because it's hard to just pick one
thing because I never thought it would
ever come from come to this I'm just
gonna say the best thing that's happened
since tiny YouTube is what it's done to
me as a person that's not like a
materialistic thing um
I answered a lot of the questions are
imperative so I'm sorry I didn't answer
your question there'll be more Q&amp;amp;A in
the future for sure so if you liked this
video and you like these more sort of
personal videos with this background and
stuff like that make sure to tell me in
the comments and give it a thumbs up and
leave future requests in the comments
below that you want to see next but
until next time I'll see you soon bye
