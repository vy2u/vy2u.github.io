hey guys welcome back to my channel so
as you guys know from previously if you
didn't watch my previous video I will
link it down below
I have teamed up with Kiko Milano to
mark the launch of their beauty games
collection and create tutorials we using
the products from their range today I
wanted to do something a little bit more
out of my comfort zone and a little bit
more colorful so I've created this
really precise kind of sharp black and
blue winged liner really appropriate for
this time of year
bright colors around the summer time I
love to incorporate maybe like a bright
lip or a bright eye or something like
that
something a bit more vibrant and
different like I said before the link to
their website is in the description box
down below and when you play the game
you get 20% of their newer Beauty games
collection which is incredible so make
sure to click the link down below yeah
like I said I wanted to do a slightly
different look this time flipping a bit
more colorful and something a bit more
adventurous so if you like the look of
this makeup look then make sure to give
it a thumbs up and please keep Jing
starting with a fresh phrase I'm gonna
go ahead and do it my eyebrows and then
I'm going in with the Kiko eye base
obviously it's just to prime our eyes
this one's amazing in the sense that it
has kind of a flesh undertone to it so
as you can see it's really helping me
cancel out any discoloration on my eyes
and getting rid of any sort of like
veins or stuff like that and obviously
it's gonna make our eye shadow it lasts
the longest time and then I'm gonna go
ahead and with some tape this is to make
sure that our eye shadow and line is
super precise which is the whole point
of this look and going in with the Kiko
outdoor bronzer in a technical honey I
really love kind of multi using products
and using bronzers as a little
transition colors especially this one at
this one is super warm and super
complimentary on the eyes and I feel
like it always ties back in to the face
makeup if you use it on your face as
well
then taking the Kiko take it all a
beauty get in the net shade natural
tones and taking this middle color going
back in with the same fluffy brush and
just using that to further deepen up the
crease this palette is super handy I
think I mentioned this previously if you
travel a lot because it contains
eyeshadows and face products and even a
liner that we are going to use as well
but yet just using that medium tone to
deepen up the crease and create that
transition for a smoky eye effect again
using the same palette taking the
darkest shade going back in in kind of
buffing motions to create the smoky eye
and that transition from light to dark
but we don't want it anything it to it
dramatic because we're going to have a
super bright under eye and that's kind
of where we want the main focus to be so
this palette is perfect just for
creating that kind of natural smoky eye
effect for the lid keeping it super
simple taking the matte cream shade from
the palette and just pressing that onto
the empty space of my lid
I find packing motions and a flat brush
kind of gives you the most pigmentation
even though these eyeshadows are super
pigmented already that's how I get the
most color and then going back in with a
fluffy brush just to make sure
everything blends seamlessly then I am
at taking the pencil eyeliner from the
palette it's super pigmented so I was
able to create a winged liner with it
and having that tape there or using a
wipe makes this easier for you as well
yeah like I said just creating that
winged liner effect and I always do the
base of the wing first and then connect
it back onto the lid and just build up
the color and the pigmentation as you
can see the pencil is super super black
and super pigmented and creamy as well
so it almost looked like a liquid liner
once you're happy with your liner you
can go ahead and remove the tape we are
going to use a wipe in a minute but now
I'm moving on to the lower lash line I
am at taking the everlasting Kajal liner
in the color to 0-5 in my waterline
running it quite nicely
along my lower lash line and then using
the base of the black wing to kind of
give me a guide of where I want the wing
on the bottom to go and then yeah like I
said taking a wipe and using that to
clean up and making it super sharp and
super precise but you do want to still
be able to see it so I'm going in like a
diagonal motion so it ends thinner but
kind of is like your classic wing shape
but going from thick to thin so you can
be as messy as you want in the bottom
because you can go ahead and clean up
with a wipe afterwards and go back in
and continue to clean up to make it as
precise and sharp as you want then just
like I said smudging the lower lash line
so it kind of blends a lot better and it
looks a lot tidier then going ahead and
applying some black mascara on the top
this is just their beauty energy mascara
in black but then for the lower lash
line I wanted to do something a little
bit different so I'm going in it with
the same Beauty energy at mascara but in
the shade 0-4 which is a bit more of a
cobalt blue so a different shade of blue
to the pencil that we've used and yeah
just to kind of add a bit of another pop
of color and something a bit different
then using my favorite Kiko false
eyelashes these are in the shade shade
the style natural oh one and this is the
finished eyelet I'm so glad this Beauty
games collection contained loads of
bright colors so it means it can be a
lot more adventurous but moving on to
the skin I'm taking there 210 brush and
there concealer and this is just a
little trick to help
Nealon and it's Heidi and make it super
sharp and super precise so you're
allowed to clean up any sort of mistakes
and yeah like I said make the line up
super crisp
just to finish up on the face I'm going
back in with the technical honey outdoor
bronzer and just dusting that all over
my face and all the places that I like
to sleep define a bit more so my
cheekbones the tops of my forehead and
along my jaw and kind of like down my
neck a bear
then I'm just taking the blusher from
the take it all at beauty care and just
applying that to the apples of my cheeks
for a little subtle flush of color for
highlight I'm taking the 3d light and
glow in the shade at zero one and just
using my finger to press that onto the
tops of my cheekbones just to give a
really healthy glow I've really loved
the formula of these they kind of have
three tones to them so it looks super
natural and gives you like I said a
really healthy glow to the skin
now I'm just applying that to my Cupid's
bow and the tip of my nose just to make
them glow as well on tulips I'm a taking
the Kiko precision lip pencil in 5:01
which is a super natural shape and I'm
just kind of using that to outline my
lips and kind of color the majority of
it in and give them a good base for what
we go on the top with and on top I'm
going in with a Kiko finish line
lipstick in at0 six
either leave it there and have more of a
very nude but I'm just going in with the
same a formula of lipstick but in the
shade 0-1 just to lighten it up slightly
and be more of a kind of light at nude
color but yeah then that is the finished
makeup look so this is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
