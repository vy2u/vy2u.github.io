today I am bringing you a kind of bronzy
summer goddess II makeup look with loads
of shimmery finishes to the skin and the
eyes so if you'd like the look of this
makeup look then please keep watching
prior to filming I had already done my
eyebrows using the soap &amp;amp; Glory brow
artery and hot chocolate and the Loreal
brow artist plumper in medium dark to
prep my skin and give it some hydration
i'm using mac fix+ spray as almost like
a base but i am going to be using a
primer as well i'm using the l'oreal
lumi magique primer to give me that
really dewy finish to the skin i'm just
going to be using my hands to massage
that into my face
to add a bit of color underneath my
foundation I'm using the charlotte
tilbury suit their supermodel body just
to add a bit of a bronze shimmer as a
base as well
for foundation I'm using the make up for
ever ultra HD in the shade one two seven
I've recently been using this I've been
absolutely loving it it honestly is
really HD like it says it gives a really
good medium to buildable coverage and
I'm just gonna be using a damp Beauty
Blender to apply this
for concealing and contouring I'm going
to be using the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in light warm for my concealer
and the nyx concealer in nutmeg as a
cream contour i feel when doing kind of
jewy looks using a cream contour looks a
lot more natural on the skin and gives
you more of a bronzed finish if that
makes sense it looks a lot more real
to blend that all in I'm just going to
be using the same beauty blender I use
to apply my foundation to blend in my
concealer and using a Mac's one one
eight one eight eight it's one of the
other something like that stippling
brush to blend in my control
on up to the eye makeup when doing
bronze looks like this I really like the
appearance of a really shimmery inner
corner highlight so I am using snowflake
pigment by bellapierre cosmetic and just
apply this like I said in my inner
corner and really lightly on my brow
bone as well
as a base I'm using the Charlotte
Tilbury champagne diamond's a shadow
pencil thing and just running that all
over my lid for my crease shade I'm
using this NYX eye shadow in the shade
called in' and just buffing that into my
crease as per usual with my Sigma e-40
brush I'm kind of trying to wing it out
slightly just to give it because we're
not going to be wearing eyeliner with
this look so just to give the eye a bit
more shape to deepen up the socket I'm
using a makeup geek brown sugar eyes
shadow on this is a waver pointed crease
brush and yeah just buffing it into the
crease to add a bit more dimension and
taking it just onto the outer quarter of
the eye
then taking goddess also by makeup geeks
are just a slightly warmer brown shade
and using this as the transition between
the base that we applied and the dark
brown shade in the crease
now to intensify the base I'm using
another bit there bellapierre cosmetics
pigment this one is in the shade
champagne and just pressing that over
where we applied the charlotte tilbury
pencil for mascara I'm using the sinew
sin eurocity lash by Sigma and just
applying a thin coat I like this one
just because the bristles are the a
really firm so it really separates and
lengthens my lashes and you can just
leave it there but I am going to apply
false lashes these are the SC Ito lashes
in this shade shade in the style oh so
sweet they're really natural looking and
just because we're not wearing any liner
I didn't want anything too heavy and I'm
also using the Escudo lash glue to apply
these to finish off the face makeup I'm
using my hourglass ambient lighting
powder in the shade diffused light to
set my under eye concealer and anywhere
else that I applied the concealer
concealer we applied earlier is kind of
acting as a contour so I'm going
straight in with a bronzer this is the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in toe
pads it's got a really a luminous finish
it's basically like all their other
highlighters that they do but in a deep
bronze shade so I like to use this as a
bronzer but this looks stunning if you
have darker skin as a cheekbone
highlight and then going in with Becca
champagne pop as my cheekbone highlight
on the top and then also going to apply
the laura geller
gilded honey highlighter on the top as
well for that extra forms God s look and
literally in love with the way that all
these layered highlighters make my skin
look it's definitely one of my favorite
lips and I'll probably continue to wear
this into the order my don't care that
it looks some really more to finish off
the eyes I'm using makeup geek goddess
in the inner part of my lower lash line
and then going to be applying makeup
geek brown sugar again on the outer
portion of my lower lash line
then just applying mascara to my bottom
lashes this is the Mack extended play
mascara as always this will always
forever be my favorite lower lash
mascara
flipz I wanted to keep it very nude but
golden so I'm using my soft matte lip
cream in Cairo and applying this OCC
stained gloss in the end hair that I'd
literally just mentioned in my last
video I will leave that down below if
you wanted to check that out yeah just
apply that all over the lips and then
applying the gloss it is quite a thick
gloss so I do like to dab tap it out
with my fingers so it's a bit more
wearable a bit less sticky and then for
the final touch I'm applying the Laura
Geller highlighter again on my Cupid's
bow and in the center of my lips as well
and this is the end result I really hope

it a thumbs up if you did it really
helps me out a lot
