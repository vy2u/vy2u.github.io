forever so I wanted this video to kind

the products that I'm using but I have
listed them all down below the purpose
of this video is more to just gonna sit
down catch up with you guys and just
have a nice chitchat fill you in on
everything that's been kind of going on
or what's like gonna go on soon so yeah
this is just kind of like an everyday
look I'm actually going out for lunch
with my family so it's not gonna be
anything too too bad it's gonna be kind
of more like my everyday quick glam
gotta get ready to kind of look so
pretty hope you guys enjoy this video
and if you do don't forget to give it a
massive thumbs up and subscribe if you
haven't already but yeah I guess we
should probably start getting ready
Auri let's get moisturizing though I
will say I have been using this at the
moment this is the origins ginseng ultra
hydrating energy boosting cream now I am
like dying over this at the moment
because anything is super hydrating
I'm obsessed oh my god does anyone do
that like if it comes with the lid I
just kind of I don't want to waste her
so I just kind of wipe it on my face
yeah I love this at the moment I'm the
only recently got it but it's one of
those things that I knew I was gonna
love before I get it anyway
I don't wake up this morning and you
know and you I'm like starting to feel
really L like really flowy but I woke up
with the sorest throat and I was like oh
no like I thought I was gonna manage to
get through the whole year without being
L because I actually have I don't think
I've had only have been on throughout
the whole year so I'm gonna try and
ignore it because I can't grasp it
literally put such a pause on everything
when you're ill literally everything cuz
you never want to do anything and then
you're some productive and then you get
into like that rough just being
unproductive and it's not good yes I
need stuff that's gonna bring me to life
this morning so I'm just gonna kind of
let that sink into my skin for a bit and
then we will move on yeah so I was
trying to think of when the last time I
actually sat down and chatted in a video
and I feel like that's where that I'm a
single Pringle and that still is the
case but it's all good
that's all
good what I'm focusing on now is my
birthday my if you didn't already know
I'm a Libra I don't know if that means
anything to anyone and my birthday is
the sixth of October I'm gonna be
turning 21 so like official adult things
you know but I'm really excited because
I birthday week it's like so amazing so
like the week before
oh yeah I'm just gonna say I'm trying
the new sleep a life proof foundation
today it claims to be medium to full
coverage sweat proof and oil-free so
excited to try so the week before my
birthday I'm actually looks a little
dark oh my god okay let's try and make
this work make it work make it work work
work and I'm actually on a influencer
trip so I'm gonna be spending like the
week leading up to my birthday with like
all my favorite people which I'm so
excited about it's such an incredible
trip as well I don't know how much I can
sort of say about it yet but yeah oh my
god I'm so excited to that for that it's
with a such an incredible brand
obviously like I said the usual girls
are going so I'm gonna get to see them
for my birthday which would be really
nice and then for my oh sorry sorry but
it's fine I always make it work I mean
and then for my actual birthday I've
kind of like arranged like almost like a
surprise for my friends even though it's
my birthday so I was like arrange for us
all to go somewhere which is like a few
hours away for like a few days it's in
there it is in the UK but I'm not
telling you too much about it I just
kind of wanna I always applied like I am
I'm hosting something like I don't want
anyone to do anything I've kind of got
to do everything like provide all the
food drink like would ever had a party
you know you're kind of expected to
bring alcohol maybe like to a party but
I like to bring your own kind of thing
but whenever I had parties back in the
day I would always provide it all I
dunno I think I just got it from my mom
like she's such a host and like in that
kind of sense I feel like she's passed
that on to me ya know I'm so excited
it's such an incredible like house
there's like a pool I'm just in case my
friends watch this video but like they
do know that it's that kind of thing
don't know like what it looks like
exactly but yes if that's then happening
and then the weekend after is like my
best friend's 21st and then I think I'm
going on a night out with like some PR
girls because I love them and like ah
like I'm just like sighs I hope or I'm
gonna try and make 21 be the best yeah
yeah like I feel like this is my time
I'm gonna be an adult so I gotta step
things up although I am quite mature for
my age anyway but still I'm you're just
gonna get my together I feel like
dying my hair was a good step in the
right direction because I feel like it
makes me look older so many of you are
still complimenting me on my hair by the
way which still means so much to me that
you guys like because I literally love
it I've almost want to go darker I think
that it's just so sexy and it's easier
so much easier to maintain for reals and
having the extensions and stuff just
makes my hair look a lot a lot healthier
so I'm loving it I'm trying to think
what else is coming up
I feel like October it's like I'm really
gonna be a really a busy a month for me
which I don't mind about because like I
said is my birthday month I always
anticipate October to be like a really
good month and this year it is again I
think I have a meet-up in London again
with one of my favorite brands I feel
like loafie gonna enjoy it's gonna be
like cocktails and canapes and then I'm
gonna do I put makeup demo using some of
their newer products and the brand
itself is one I know you guys will
literally love and die for and it's a
brand that's like bringing out makeup so
there will they do I think they might
now but they don't actually have well
they're not known for their makeup as of
yet so I think you're gonna really
really love that so I hope you guys can
come I mean it all just hang out have a
drink and I know that's what loads of
you want to do like you guys tweet me
all the time being like let's get like
so fun it's like go out and like it's
get drunk and I'm thinking what
impression am I getting off but like
yeah let's do that I'd love to do that
with you guys
no jokes drunk times are the best times
by the way I'm liking this foundation I
know I look a little bit along G perhaps
perhaps but upon shoe it looks fine
person but I'm thinking also of maybe
like switching up my background I know
having a white background I just like a
plain a colored background when doing
makeup tutorials is for me I think it's
better just because you're not
distracted by things in the background
and there's like a lot going on when
you're doing a makeup tutorial I'm
thinking maybe it's switching up to
something when I sort out my lounge
maybe I might make a little blue
background and but kind of for more the
sit-down chat videos but I don't I feel
like I don't do those sit-down chatty
videos a lot but if you guys want me to
do them then let me know just kind of
like maybe question aren't so type
videos or I mean I have done them in the
past you guys know I have but I don't do
them oh I don't know I thought you guys
don't engage with me so much on those
videos but if you've got anything you
want me to do that kind of video then
let me know and I'll get maybe like a
different back on I like my bedroom
background remember I've done a few of
those like those kind of videos because
if you guys like don't let me know then
I don't actually know I don't want to
like put content out there that you
don't want to see cuz then what's the
point I'm like putting time and effort
into something that you don't really
care for but if you guys just like me
for my makeup tutorials then I can stick
to those and then just let me know what
other makeup tutorial I think the next
one I want to do it's definitely more of
like the dark red or to Romanus I think
I want to do like an all that dark red
eye and that dark red lip that kind of
thing so if you think that would be
something you're interested in again let
me know also any of you guys are if
you're from the UK you'll know what this
is but any of you guys gonna go to
Fright Night this year because I think I
am
I love Fright Night and like thought
part guys don't know what Fright Night
is its own there we have a theme park in
the UK called fright know we have a
theme park in the UK called thought Park
and it's basically in October they
really like they bring out mazes and
like kind of morph they're like scary
rides and like they have people that are
dressed up to scare so it's basically
around the time of Halloween they just
make their Park super scary and it's
so much fun so let me know if you guys
are going to go to any of them because I
think I'm going to one on like a
Thursday in October so I feel like that
would be actually I think I've been
going to it like this week no next week
Thursday this week
September's or something let me know if
you guys go into that and if you do you
have to come and say hi I'm gonna be
with are y'all faves I think I think
anyway yeah I feel like that should be
sore it much fun yeah I wanna ask you
guys okay so going back to my birthday
I'm never gonna stop talking about it
until it happens so like I said I'm
having people over at like this place
whatever I want to like come up with
some games you know like drinking games
I feel like everyone plays the same old
drinking games but if you're from like a
different country and you have like
different kind of drinking games let me
know like I want like new ones that fun
that my friends would have heard of I
can introduce them to once it get you
really drunk or like whatever so yeah
let me know I want to keep people
entertained so I kind of don't want to
do the same old like it's all gonna be
my friend so I know everything about
them so don't even bother suggesting and
never have I ever because I know
everything about them and I'll know when
they're lying I feel like that game is
like brutal because because I know
everything that they've done I can be
like well never have I ever done Dadda
Dadda and like call them out and I mean
I wouldn't do that I think that's mean
actually maybe defenders pushing my
buttons I'm just kidding but yeah but
you know I mean like let me know
drinking games I feel like I know all
the usual ones I want someone to like
introduce me to something new sleep
leave me some ideas in the comments down
below but I am gonna do my eyebrows of
camera just because recently they've
been taking so long to do like so long I
don't know why I just get so engrossed
in doing them and I can't really like
talk aleem while doing them so go and do
my eyebrows metal coming back oh okay
we're back and with brows I'm just gonna
finish off my skin where's my
highlighter no I used to be watching
Real Housewives of New York like
religion
sleep on hey year and then I finished it
and then I was like damn it what else
can i watch that has like so so so many
seasons and then I picked Kardashians
and I can't stop watching it which
brings me to my next point which is why
is this SH about Kylie Jenner being
pregnant like what the hell if she is I
will laugh but I was thinking for ages
why is she just posting throwback
picture it's like why on her snapchat is
she like really am ia but I was thinking
it's because I think she got work done
like I feel like the celebrities go
really am ia man they've got work done
so it gives their body time to like calm
down like if it's like a nose job
obviously like your nose is swollen up
or if you just get your lips done your
nose swells up you knows what your lips
are really swollen and then they go down
and then you can like come back to
normal kind of thing so I thought she
just got work done and now it's all like
she's pregnant I don't believe it well I
don't know if I believe it if she is I'm
kind of here oh my god no the rumor is
that she is Kim and Kanye's surrogate
like what I thought that family was
 weird like when I was when I've
been watching Kardashian's they're just
very close a close-knit family but I
feel like that's too close for comfort
do you know but if there isn't kind of
hair for it in the sense of like the
scandal who knows but do you think the
only thing that made me think oh my god
is this actually true it's because E
news like their official Twitter
confirmed it and he produces their show
obviously Kris Jenner will be in contact
with them and like all sorts so I don't
I don't know I think it could be a PR
stunt because it's their ten-year
anniversary thing going up tonight which
means I can watch it on hey you tomorrow
but yeah like I don't know I don't know
let me know what you guys think in the
comments by the way i'm using the morphe
35o palette again you guys loves that
look that i did and i forgot how much
this palette is just so easy to use for
like everyday looks good
got so many Matt Sorum any shimmers
so yeah and they're all want Onur to my
faves for everyday yeah Oh another thing
so I watched hands video the other day I
like catch up video of just her trying
to you guys about whatever and she was
talking about becoming vegan and then I
messaged her cuz me and how I've always
been rich similar literally really
similar in everything that we do I think
that's why we're such good friends but
we started doing YouTube all time on
like the same day both of our last days
at Mac were the same day we both worked
at Mac like Christmas ham but it's so
weird lit you just like our journeys
have been so similar it's crazy and like
when we met for the first time I
remember I remember when we first met I
took her to wag among us for the first
time and like we spent on man this guy
like Janome my just like brainy similar
so when she said that she was going
vegan and stuff I was just like oh my
god and she literally like sold it to me
like we both have the same I feel like
we had the same issues with food without
going into too much detail oh my god can
everyone stop yeah so I'm gonna try it
when she said in her video even if it's
six out of the seven days of the week I
thought okay that is something I could
do because I know I love coffee like I
have these coffee coffee these coffee
sachets that are like skinny lattes and
but they're made of like milk powder and
I literally like love them but it's like
milk powder I feel like it's obviously
gonna be from like a cow's milk but
whatever like I love them I love steak I
love chicken like I know I couldn't cut
it out completely but I feel like six
out there seven days of the week maybe I
could I've found some really amazing
recipes because I don't actually really
eat a huge amount of cheese I don't eat
a huge amount of bread so I don't really
have a huge amount of butter I do like I
said love a good cup of tea and coffee
and stuff so milks gonna be really hard
but oh my god this morning I had my
first a cup of tea with oats milk you'll
it I cannot taste a difference it
actually tasted really
really a nice and that's the one thing I
was worried about because Han was saying
that she loves almond milk and stuff but
if you guys didn't know I'm actually
allergic to nuts
so I can't have nut milk and I tried
soya milk in the past and it's just not
for me my stomach just didn't agree with
it and it's actually quite like it's got
a real different taste and color and
texture and all that kind of stuff so
yeah I just really didn't like soy milk
but that was one thing that has made me
want to like try being vegan because
when I really think about it it is 2017
like why am I actually still drinking
milk from a cow like why am i doing that
I feel like imagine if cows drank our
milk you know I mean like that's a
really bizarre but I wouldn't be
comfortable going up to a cow and
literally like sucking on it
utter for milk so like why do I want to
drink milk that's like come from that
and then like been processed by a bunch
of but you know I mean what I
literally what I really think about it I
am like what am i doing but then I am
that kind of person that like would
think about it for like two minutes and
be like oh my god that's really gross
and then still be okay with eating it
but no I do want to try something
different so I had my first cup of tea
with oats milk so yummy so I'm so happy
about that I'm gonna try and keep that
as my substitute from now on I'm yet to
kind of go meat free especially now I'm
about to go out for lunch of a going to
an Italian restaurant I never like to
make a fuss in a restaurant but my food
could come completely wrong and I would
just like fine fine fine like I just
don't want to make a fuss or cause a
scene anything that draws attention to
my table or myself I get really funny
about like I remember once me and my
friends went out for a curry because I'd
never been for out for a car before I
know shock like that's just not my go-to
takeaway or I go - I never crave a
curried you don't mean but when I told
my friends I've never actually been out
for a proper carry they're like like we
have to go we have to go that order went
to the restaurant or one of my friends
it's like a big fan of like documenting
memories and just like always wanting to
take pictures which
oh here for a bit like in a restaurant I
just can't
he was like excuse me do you mind taking
a picture of our table and I was like
what I was caught soft bottles that oh
my god oh my god oh my god literally I
think I'm inside crying like just
because I've got really hot and bothered
and started hyperventilating so yeah I
don't really like anything that draws
attention to the table so the thought of
being in a restaurant and having to be
like hey um it's this vegan friendly and
I just know because from experience of
being someone that suffers from like a
nut allergy and having to be like oh um
do you know if this has any nuts in and
it's like oh I don't know let me go and
ask the chef and they come back with
like a book like I don't know if you've
been to Wagga Mama's I had asked wait
hold on oh I think that was like a
pudding me and my friend had been like
oh my god that we never get putting in
Wagga Mama's like let's get one shoe off
to see when she's to get like the chokes
you want so I have to be that person
it's like I'm can you tell me if this
has mountain or not and oh my god and
why the llamas they're like oh I don't
know let me just check and then they
come back with this like allergen birth
that's a good giant Bible bring it to
like your whole table flick through find
your meal like go across and be like ah
no nuts or like ah sorry like that is I
feel like it's so if I had an allergic
reaction they couldn't be blamed because
they bought out the birth can like
showed me I don't want to be like why is
this vegan friendly like if it's pasta
suppose it's got like eggs and there's
so many things I forgot honey for
instance you can't have honey because it
comes from a bee and the whole point of
vegan is that you don't eat anything
from an animal I feel like it's gonna
take some getting used to but like my
sister knows me so well she was like
don't be upset with yourself if if you
give up or like you find it really hard
to just like jump straight in like from
obviously going from eating a lot of
meat to like know me for a lot of the
week so I was like nah I'll be able to
do it but I know me
I'll see like a steak on the menu and be
like but I am gonna try yeah like I said
in the cup upcoming months of October
and stuff I should hopefully have a
meet-up in London with you guys and I
got a couple of taco couple of trips
coming up and from facts like Oh
