sultry smoky evening summer holiday
makeup and it's chat with me and listen
to me a rant and ramble and please keep
watching
holy it so enhances I everyone died
for the kitty ears best man that
business is about to get crackin okay so
a tip again I'm gonna hide and BRE this
I'm going to prep my skin so to do that
fast I'm going to take the Mac prepping
prime oil I literally haven't used this
in forever and I love the appearance of
beauty oils underneath my skin so I'm
just going to do a couple of lines or
strokes and you will across my skin and
then just kind taking a synthetic brush
and just making sure that's all just
kind of evenly spread out oil underneath
your skin if you kind of have like a
normal to dehydrated skin or like dry
skin like me really really nice
alternative to a moisturizer I mean I do
it obviously love to mix it up and I do
as you guys know hold on
love love love my oyster eyes underneath
but I know Anne Ricci uses a beauty oil
pan she's like so against climate
although I feel so on her snapchat she's
been liking that wire sell one and it
shouldn't been a while but from what I
remember before that she just use like
facial oil underneath I happen a couple
to see if you guys know it's always
flawless so I'm just trying it out you
know okay one final plied via beauty oil
I'm just going to spray it myself with
fists phenomenal but I get that extra
hydration and also I'm real and that
just called me down okay it's a primer
I've been loving it this one is the
anoth radiance primer yeah like a
slightly paint undertone to it so really
a nice to brighten up the skin and it
gives such a gorgeous glow to the skin
in not even kidding
so I do like to apply a primer over my
skincare I don't just use the skincare
as my primer but that's just because I
want my makeup to really last all day
and my skin just doesn't have like a
natural adhesive adhesive T and to it so
I need the primer to give me a little
bit of tuck tuck you see that glory yes
that's kind of like the combination of
the oil and the primer together
I'm obsessed okay now for foundation I
do have a little bit of tan on that is
developing for my foundation that will
look a little bit darker than my face I
am going to mixing two together now I
feel like people might be like oh my god
why are you using Mac's it's not coming
out yet I'm taking it the next total
control foundation today is the 31st
right this comes out tomorrow guys so
don't you worry
honestly I'm so excited for this to drop
I'm pretty sure it's the first
attunement it comes out I wanna see you
barely need any of this foundation they
have so many colors as I'm sure you've
seen on people's with snapchats at the
PR boxes that they've been doing so many
colors you barely need any of it it
lasts all day it's amazing I'm mixing
the color caramel and true beige
together but I'm not as dark as I
usually am so I can maybe kind using
more of the true beige but I really like
the undertones of these they're both
really yellow and golden be careful
though I will I'm to be careful though
I'm wearing white right now so let's
make sure we don't get in lock codes
they were too like half pumps at a equal
one and then of the caramel color just a
couple of drops this is like way more
than enough I'm just gonna look at me
what the hell I just going to take my
Beauty Blender I see like that's gone so
far already I'm just going to take my
Beauty Blender and buffed up and we are
going to be going through like a darker
eye today but it's a rounded eye and you
guys know I prefer to see my skin first
I'm doing around his eyes so once I'm
happy that that is all blended and I'm
going to take my concealer and for that
I'm going to take the top shape tape and
light to medium I don't know why I'm
using the students and I can feel like
it's really running out and it's so hard
to get hold of that I'm just going to be
placing it underneath the eyes and up
the bridges of my nose just to kind make
my nose a little bit then huh and then
I'm just going to take it's a matte
Beauty Blender as before and the lend
in sorry for the movement uploaded
yesterday if you guys follow me on my
social and stuff you know I had a little
bit I said a little bit it was quite
drastic to be honest disaster with Maya
finger but everything you can see from
there thank God but um basically I
thought I was allergic to acrylic nails
which as a beauty blogger and whoever I
am actually probably someone that just
doesn't make us in loves a good coffee
anyway and yeah so I got my nails done
about a month ago just you know normal
plays whatever and I've came up with
like a reaction at first I was like oh
my god maybe she was just like a little
bit rough and she triggered like because
I think you know you get these like
little cuts on the side of your fingers
when she was like fighting my nails look
like sometimes I guess I was like just
because just because she was like
hitting it a little bit slightly rich it
was kind of like unavoidable so I just
thought that I had by her doing that
maybe she'd just triggered I know that a
reaction type thing just because of the
pain that I was in so I didn't really
think much of it cuz it wasn't that bad
the first time I got it done and then I
went somewhere else up in London I just
quickly needed some in Phil's had it
done again and then oh my god it was I
just started to be bit itchy and just on
stage felt all fallen outside oh my god
like what's going on like this has
happened again and maybe it's just some
time before but then I kind of got over
and I kind of like forgot that I've even
had that reaction by way I'm just going
to bake and set everything with powder I
kind of forgot I did even had that
reaction before because it kind of
healed and I mean I just kind of forgot
about it you know I mean you just have
to nail them for so long and then
they've gone back to normal whatever
then I got themselves or like actually
like redone or whatever God and it was
awful like I was waking up at 5:00 a.m.
that she wanted to like scratch my
fingers off like they were just les
Turing and in it so much pain so I
thought oh my god I must be allergic to
acrylics like I've got to get them taken
off so I went and got them taken off
and got a regular gel manicure so like
this way that they are now like my
natural nails happened again and almost
like not worse but just God one it's
like this finger you can't hold up you
can't really see from that far but up
close it really is more in my opinion
like just gross like blistered and that
cut down the side and all of that stuff
yeah it happened again and I haven't got
a critics on
I mean maybe am I've been as I had to go
to the doctor say cuz I found one of my
fingers and it just bled everywhere so
that's why I couldn't film that time
where I'm going with this story but
obviously like it was awful but I am now
I'm Carol the story I am now after I
baked in kind of worked that way going
to put a bit more powder underneath just
because I'm scared that there might be a
little bit of fallout so I'm just going
to leave this so now I'm just going to
go ahead and it fill in my eyebrows and
for that I'm going to take these NYX and
micro brow pencil and where is this ash
brown to do it be kind of ends and tail
of my brow and then it be a benefit
precisely at my brow pencil in the shade
to through the front and then I love to
set it in place with like a lighter brow
journal type thing and for today I'm
going to use the Loreal brow well come
back via Loreal brow artist plumper in
the shade blonde and then I'll be back
to because everyone does that I was
differently and I've filled in the last
couple of times and it's I wanna quit
for me to just do them off camera but
then I'll be back to finish my story
okay we are back you a slightly zoomed
in and that is the look now I went for I
did one eye off just because I was going
to be like I'm using a couple of
products I've not used before this isn't
like a bison passion don't think so I
just wanted to see the career best
technique to do it so I'm actually going
to be taking it Viet Minh taciturn owner
work and set eyeliner and this is in the
color brown and I'm going to be applying
this all over the lid as like our
initial lid when I was a synthetic brush
because these work the best with creams
now this one's called work and sets I
feel like you have to be quite quick
with it that's just the kind of
impression that I got I mean I didn't
find
very hard to blend this is like so
pigmented as well but you just kind of
taking it all the way up to my crease
and then it doesn't matter if you're a
little bit like a rough around the edges
because we are going to be applying
shadow to help soften them and bust them
out for all of the priest colors today
I'm going to be taking the morphe 35o
palette military love this palette and
I'm going to be taking this kind of here
a really soft warm up around and just
using that too let's start to give you
that cream and or just like soften up
the edges so basically just applying it
where we normally would give you that
cream wasn't mad but just kind of I like
to use extra circular motions after I've
put like a product like this down just
to really help soften and diffuse it we
have to carrying on with my story at my
nails can you tell I'm deeply affected
by this could literally cancel talking
about it but yeah I hope you join the
gel manicure went to the doctor's
yesterday they basically said they're
not gonna be able to tell me exactly
what it is but I'm just going to have to
do like trial and error which is kind of
annoying but I'm just going to wait till
a heel this is Akane
he said I can't really apply a much heat
to it I like to get my fingers really
hot so I didn't want to then go and get
my gels taking oxygen after like far the
more and yes I'm just probably going to
wait a little while to my hands here and
then like peel them off and then just
paint them with regular polish I'm going
to just take a shade darker and I'm
going to take this color here and again
just repeat the process but slightly
lower down and so more into the crease
just to create this really kind of smoky
effect I wanted to go for a dark I say I
said I could I've done a lot of light
and simple summer look so I wanted to do
something for may look at evening I
definitely feel more like evening vibes
with they're a lot more sultry and then
I'm going to take a flat brush and it
just takes this corner color here which
is a deep matte brown and I'm basically
just going to use this over the top of
the gel none and that we just put down
just to make sure it's a hundred
like the set in place and the color is
really kind of pigmented and and then
I'm going to take a precise crease brush
brush and then I'm going to take this
dark brown at color here
and I'm just going to use that again at
the final crease color and it's slightly
darker than the one that we use in our
lid so perfect to kind of get that final
blend and make sure there's no harsh
lines and just going backwards and
forwards just make sure it or blended to
feather fix that now I did kind of want
a slightly darker thing like line going
across the horse line so I'm going to
take the Marc Jacobs high liner and
Brown out and just really lightly
choose run right along top because we
are going to be applying lashes I just
want to grow something now and this has
a little bit of a gold of glitter to it
so it's super super free and now I'm
going to highlight my inner corner after
that I'm going to take the skinny dip
highlighter from my issue a just because
that's what I plan to shave my cheeks is
well sorry let's just pop up in here
also cuz it's such a dark look you kind
of want to brighten up your in a corner
yeah okay and now I'm going to wipe away
the powder underneath the eyes because
actually I wasn't that much washi really
any fallout so you can wipe that away
now we're done with you but now I'm
going to use another pencil in the
waterline and this is dia Nix of gold in
a bronze eye pencil whoo i frickin love
this sorry it's like it's really hard to
be on camera and do this but I can't do
it hold on okay so that is now in your
waterline and now I'm going to take that
second crease color that we use you know
like the brick II ready warm up round
and just buff that along the lower lash
line and now I'm going to take a flat
brush and then that dark brown that we
actually use on the lid to set that eye
on in place and just press that up into
my a lower lash line just underneath
and then once again taking the pencil
brush no extra product on it just
softening that oh whoa okay from a scar
I'm going to take the Big Shot colossal
mascara from Maybelline obsessed
obsessed obsessed on the CV I like to
wear false eyelashes on holiday
definitely make sure to give yourself a
few coats of this so you get super
dramatic and voluminous lashes that you
can like see-through or so you can see
against this dark shadow but because
we're going to be applying falsies and
just applying a light coat to the top
and the bottom but I'm UPSI a bit more
generous on the bottom because I want
them to be more like visible and I don't
supply but a thick bottom lashes yes I
mean I'm just going to lightly leave
that mascara now but for lashes I'm
going to take these these are the
Melrose lashes from a backstage beauty
and they are super rounded and super
fluffy and if I could find my lash glue
I totally apply them so like I said they
are super rounded and super wispy I
think that constitutes for the Lily
Miami lashes so if you know what those
look like these are super similar and
just as good a quality so I'm just going
to apply these and then I'll be right
back so these are the finished either
lashes on I read up the shades am i
doing that too too dramatic so you can't
see what's going on on the top and then
super fluttery and wispy and recommend
the eyes so loving them and now we can
move a back on it to the face okay so to
warm up our complexion I'm going to take
the Mac mineralized skinfinish in the
shade dark on a big widget this is a
sigma tapered face brush and just use
this to warm up the skin not to like
contour as much just yeah give our skin
a bit of warm okay to contour I'm going
to take the contour pan called bad habit
from makeup geek and just really lightly
use this to define our cheeks a bit more
and then I like to both kind of upwards
to blend it in to the
and as you can see do you think it gives
you a bit more like definition on your
cheekbone the blusher I'm going to take
it be a two-faced
this is a book Papa don't peach blusher
I've been a tree reconsiders and
nothing's at the moment
mainly because it smells shallow good
I'm just going to apply those oh my god
policy smells so yummy it just has the
perfect amount of like peach and pink
balance and I'm learning that and now
for highlighting again that is Italian
taking it the is your way of skinny dip
powder highlighter I've been loving
loving loving this many of you saw my
last tutorial it's you blown away by it
they're so creamy and pigmented I'm just
going to apply that to the top how many
fun sorry about this right now I know
who are we thinking what just happened
but I'm so hot like my makeup will start
coming off in a minute so I'm just
repairing to the last I'm just going to
apply that up here and then just on the
tip of my nose and I will come back and
do my Cupid's bow like this away so for
the lip I wanted to kind of go nude I
feel like a lot of my other makeup tips
I've done a bit like a more simple eye
and a couple lips like I said earlier
and for this I feel like the eyes are
quite dramatic so like I said just learn
to keep something simple in the lip I
mean you're taking it to a product from
buxom one is the full-on lip cream in
White Russian which is a lot more
picking tip I kind of wanted it to be
look a little bit glossy so I've got the
Samantha full um lip cream to put on the
top I mean like a so I'm just going in
with D it cements or gloss on top just
for some extra you know what and that is
the makeup all done now we can move on
to her okay so for her this is like my
natural hair like a dried yeah come on
you Granger vibes I know so I'm going to
separate my hair and see them at a sleek
e-street kind of thing so I'm just going
to separate my hair into sections
because that's the easiest way for me
person
me to be able to straighten my hair I
can't just give it the once-over in one
big legs otherwise it's just not
effective actually so I'm getting my
hopes up but it requires a better side a
bitch hold my hopes they're just easy to
brush so I don't like catch them I'm
just going to brush through them so the
students I'm going to be using are these
ones from Bellamy I think that kind of
knew they actually are straighteners and
you can lock them together lock them in
place and then there are color so these
are like perfect for when you're going
on holiday and I always do leave my
discount codes and link to shop anything
Bellamy it down below so if you look at
these I took the knife you know it's
kind of new but yeah I'm just going to
go ahead and straight my ear these
little wispy bits of African were so one
seems to enjoy hair I'm actually just
going to it's going to be quite a simple
straight look I think I wanted to go for
an updo but now I'm kind of thinking I
want my hair down so I'm just going to
take these two like front fringy bits
that would be a fringe and then I'm just
gonna tuck it behind my ear and then
take a slide and just pin that like in
play and it's same again on this side
just taking like a bit cleaner front
bang frenzy bear put the other stuff
behind the back of your head and then
tuck it and clip it in place but then it
would like the rest of my hand just like
a brush it bucks it's not in the same
little parting and then just bring it
forward like - do something super like
sleek like so and then I'm going to take
some shockwaves hair spray and just use
that to really lock that in place so
something kind of easy and sophisticated
so now that you can go back go on the
fights over guys and this is the
finished makeup and hair so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
