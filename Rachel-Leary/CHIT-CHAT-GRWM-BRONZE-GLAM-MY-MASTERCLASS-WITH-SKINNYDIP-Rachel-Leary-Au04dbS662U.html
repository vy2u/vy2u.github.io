today for those who either didn't know
last week I did a master class with
skinny-dip London introducing you to
their new makeup range their new brushes
cuz I know and I think a skinny dip I
think of those awesome phone cases and
those superstars like makeup bags and
stuff they've recently just released a
whole makeup range so they invited me
down to their store to kind of post a
masterclass kind of showing you all
their makeup and like yeah you guys got
to come we got to drink together take
pictures and all that good stuff but
there was limited places so I wanted to
recreate the look for you guys that I
did there as like a bronzer glam get
ready with me it's a signature kind of
me look it is a bronze smokey eye and
like a red lip really dewy skin so I
hope you guys love that and like I said
I am until me as like a chicken ready
with me so we can talk all the way
through so I can show you all that
makeup and brushes and all that good
stuff and then at the end I've added in
little clips of the me up so if you guys
didn't get to go
you still get kind of a full experience
with what happened there so really hope
you guys enjoy this look obviously it's
a signature look to me it wasn't gonna
be anything else I've left a link to all
the skinny dip products I've been using
it down below including the brushes and
obviously the makeup and you can use the
code Rache Larry 20 to get 20% off any
of the skins it blends and stuff but I'm
using and just on their website in
general so I feel without further ado
let's get glam started talking let's
just go just gonna hoist ur eyes on my
skin I feel like I haven't like sat down
and talked with you guys and ages
honestly these past few weeks have been
like so busy for me like the hyung
behind the scenes work and like events
and it was my birthday like weekend
celebrations and all that kind of stuff
so I feel totally out of the loop what's
going on with you guys how's your week
going I know when this goes up it's kind
of like not the beginning of the week or
anything but let me know anyway so like
I said the meet-up was last week and I
can't believe the details for it
actually sold out it was up there like
comment garden store I honestly had like
a best time
hanging with you I tried to make sure I
spoke to everyone individually before
the event actually started well though
I'm just applying my primer and I'm
gonna be using the call at might see it
to brush and it's the tequila sunrise
collection wonder why I was gravitated
to that one love a bit of tequila you
guys know I like to apply it my primer
with a brush anyway and this one's a
really nice round top 1/2 of buffer and
press it into my skin anyway like I said
the meetup was last week and I'll see it
was so much fun getting to talk to you
guys individually but now where you all
came from like what you've been doing
that day I really love events like that
I hate that this might be limited at
people but then it makes it so much
easier for me to talk to you all and
like actually have like a personal chat
and like pictures and like have time for
everyone I'm sure I'll be doing like
more in the future but that was on a sea
light so fun especially cuz we got to
drink a photobooth honestly the
skinny-dip team I liked ain't like just
like us like you can tell they're like
really cool people just the brand itself
I want to see it was so so much fun to
apply my foundation I'm just gonna be
using the flat out fabulous from the
same let's brush set that one comes in a
set by the way the tequila sunrise shut
the contour brush there so this is just
like a flat top kabuki brush to kind of
give me maximum coverage from my
foundation you've never tried anything
from skinny dip before definitely check
out the links down below just because
they're like a cruelty-free vegan brand
their whole packaging and image is just
so fun and quirky and just like so me
which was why I was so excited it's like
do this with them so we thought well I
better like what better brand to do it
with them like one that I feel
represents me like age-wise and like you
guys it's just so quirky and funky and I
have like 800 phone cases from them so
it did make sense moving on we're gonna
do it cannot see her but like I said
I've had like the busiest past couple of
weeks and it's been doing so much stuff
for you guys that like I've kind of been
dropping hints about hair and there you
guys know the drill when you can't talk
about something I know it's so annoying
but something is happening very very
soon what
kind of in like the finalizing processes
some things that like I'm sorry you guys
are literally gonna love like die over
well not literally but you know got back
and forth so many times with these
things because I want them to be perfect
spam a little bit of a perfectionist
when it comes to things with my name on
because obviously like my name is like
on the I don't want anything to ruin
that but just saying you guys know
there's stuff to look forward to it like
I don't know if it's going to by the end
of the week or like next week I'll
probably find out very very soon but
make sure you're following me on my
stretches and stuff so you can be the
first to know because I never know what
platform is like the easiest to like
announce things on silicates Twitter cuz
it's instant and like snapchat so make
sure you're following me on there and
then you went myself I'm now gonna go
ahead and set everything in place with
powder and I'm gonna use the fleek burns
Siwon tequila sunrise brush from that
same set it's got a really nice kind of
tapered top so I can fit perfectly
underneath my eyes and like then all
over my face I thought you could
probably use this brush to like
highlight your skin with to like or at
contour with if they're like all brushes
like have names on them but you can
really use them for whatever you want
okay now we're gonna do our eyebrows I
just really quickly did one to make it
easier I'm gonna take the it's a winged
thing from there I kept you not
tequila sunrise range and they do
actually sell an individual by brow and
lash brush which I am gonna use I prefer
to use that one to kind of sculpt out my
eyebrows so you'll see the many ways
they're both angled brushes basically
but this one is just more on the smaller
side and this allows me to get really
precise movement and be a lot more kind
of detail
then just drag the product through the
front always like to kind of trace the
bottom of my brow and then just kind of
use the brush to flick up the product
like just whatever's left on the brush
look and then like I said they do do
like an eyebrow and lash brush this is
called but I'm just gonna take this end
of the brush and dip it into a my
concealer and use that to kind of scope
out my brow just because it's a lot kind
of wider and I feel like I've really did
e brows like my natural brows so this
actually works a lot nicer for me too
just a really like flat edge and go
does anyone else hold their breath when
they're doing things like that
whether it's like eyeliner or just like
really like small precise movements that
you have to get right like the first
time I'm always like do no no we can't
just blend like so now eyebrows are done
I think I'm gonna go back to finishing
off the face so it's now time for
bronzer and to apply that I'm just gonna
use the skinny dip all round a flawless
like a big fluffy brush this is perfect
for bronzer it's got like such a big
surface area it allows me to like warm
up my whole face it's literally like one
big giant buffing brush maybe notice
I've actually had like no hairs like
faller up onto my face and normally with
like new brushes and stuff that can
happen so I'm very impressed so didn't
actually get to use the face brush I
mean I'm using before but like I didn't
actually get to use them life for you
guys when I was there cuz I had my face
kind of already done
I'm smiling outside and finally show you
or introduce to you one of the skinny
dip makeup products and it is they're
high light and illuminate palette if
there's a hundred percent lit of the
tour which I was like obsessed with so
it comes in three shades we've got
where's my champagne California dreamin
and viva la diva
a highlighter almost like more of a
champagne shimmery bronze highlighter
and a shimmery blusher so I was
literally obsessed with this when I saw
this because they're like three of my
favorite things and if I just like
swatch it for you like oh my god so I'm
going to start off with the blush a
shade called a viva la diva and just
apply this as like a really subtle
Cherie
lusha I love that it's more like a
peachy undertone cuz you guys know I'm
not a massive blusher wearer so this
just gives like a subtle peachy glow to
the skin which is like ideal for me and
like an everyday kind of casual glam
amazing and now we can move on it to it
the next color which is the California
Dreaming shade to me this kind of
reminds me a lot of like a shimmery
bronzer kind of shade which is what I'm
gonna kind of use it for so I'm kind of
just gonna be a dusting this it's kind
of along the tops of my cheekbones like
my forehead and all that good stuff just
to create like an overall glow I'm just
picking up my powder brush to do that
actually the one that I used earlier the
fleek burns one that I used to set my
under eyes with just because I feel like
that was the perfect shape I'm just kind
of using like the other side of the
brush if you like more of their like
strobe finish and not like too too
intense highlight then I definitely just
use this as your highlight but you guys
know I love like a shimmery bronzer I
love dusting it like all around my face
just to create can you see that like
just create that really soft glam glow
look as you guys know recently I've been
loving using a liquid illuminated before
how do I know just because it gives like
a really good base before you add your
power to highlight it gives it something
to cling to so it's really gonna pop and
skinny-dip have come out with their own
iniquity illuminator as part of like
they sell them individually but they do
sell this and that has a good kit and I
think you saved their money on it so
definitely recommend getting them two
together I'm just gonna pump some on the
back of my hand to show you guys like
how gorgeous that such I like so I'm
gonna like rub that all in well
literally the most like gorgeous glow
since I've just rub that in I'm gonna
pump
back of a hand again and just kind of
apply it with my finger and just gonna
work that into the skin if you guys have
never tried this technique before of
using like a liquid illuminator before
your highlighter I definitely recommend
giving it a go it honestly makes it
stand out and like pop like so much more
and also I find it makes it last a lot
longer because well you'd wear private
before foundation to make it last longer
so this is just kind of like the same
concept you're applying like a cream
base before hand tips sorry to give the
product something to cling to and make
lasts a lot longer
oh my god I'm obsessed so that was the
liquid illuminator and now we can
finally add the powder highlight in this
color this is in the shade where's my
champagne which is exactly what I'm
thinking right about now and again I'm
going to take that powder brush but only
like literally the top part of the brush
and just go right over the top well you
barely need any of this stuff like it
blinds it pops
especially on top of that liquid
illuminator it's so intense this is like
a real life face chin
not on my face I'm just gonna just that
my cute nose oh so this is obviously at
the skin makeup complete what do you
guys think I'm feeling like literally a
hundred percent but that was the
highlight and illuminate palette in
combination with that liquid illuminator
to kind of give myself the glam glowy
skin that you guys know I'm obsessed
with oh my god I love it so far I
already knew that I loved it but you
know what I mean now we can move on to
the eyes and I can't wait to show the
other step ok so now we can move on it
to the eyes and I'm gonna take the there
she glows I shadow palette by skinny-dip
one can we talk about all of that
packaging
I'll keep saying this and litter
obsessed now one of my eyeshadows
classic me I was coming into filming
dropped it on the floor so it's a little
bit crumbled so I'm gonna insert a
picture here of the pallet and the
and what it looks like it has 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 kind of shimmery shades and then
we've got some matte shades in that as
well in a range of colors that you can
take from a light to dark I'm going to
be using the kind of darker bronzer
shades for today's looks me and that's
the kind of look that I love so to begin
I'm going to take the shade coconuts
which is just like a soft warm brown
shade we're gonna use that as our
initial transition color on my favorite
brush by then it is called their crease
police brush so this is just like your
classic big fluffy brush and just gonna
use that to blend that in I literally
love the names of everything as you can
see it's just that gorgeous soft brown
perfect transition color moving on I'm
gonna take the shade California to a
further deepen up the crease and I'm
just going to take that on the same
brush because I feel like it's just
easier that way and it's a slightly like
warmer brown shade on there like a perp
inner side I feel like it actually has a
little bit of shimmer to it but not too
much that I don't feel confident enough
wearing it like in my crease I always
say you should stick to nuts but it's
not too sparkly it's just like a nice
satin finish they all all the colors
kind of work well together to create all
sorts of looks whether you like
something more per player or on the
browner like more neutral side now I
look my favorite color you can see
there's the color that fell out but this
is the shade of gold digger and I'm
gonna place that all over my lid oh my
god it's like the perfect bronzer
shimmer and I'm gonna take from that the
I kid you not
the invasive brush which is just the
perfect flat brush to pack it on the lid
yes just gonna use like backwards and
forwards motions to kind of blend that
into the crease colors - sorry my skin
is just like bathing us I'm just gonna
get back in with me fluffy brush just to
diffuse it all together now I'm just
gonna take the tape
and of this brush here it is the blended
baby Oh
the blend baby blend but like it's got a
little bit of an angle so it's perfect
just to dip in to this shade here which
is called hustlin which is basically a
dark matte brown just so I can be kind
of super precise and just kind of only
really place it in the outermost part of
my eye and then we can go back in
without crease police and just make sure
it's kind of all diffuse together that's
all I'm kind of gonna do in terms of
like crease colors and all that stuff so
I'm gonna highlight my inner corner now
I can't remember if I've said this on
camera but I definitely said it as at my
event I really really struggled to
highlight my inner corner I don't know
what it is I just could never do it as
well as when anyone else does it for me
so I've been trying loads of different
brushes and you know what works the best
really really small ones and especially
like eyeliner brushes so I'm gonna take
the feeling of fine eyeliner brush and
take the shade good vibes which is like
a shimmery white color which is perfect
for highlighting art in a corner but
also what I love about these brushes as
you'll soon see it's not only can I be
super precise with my placement
unlike actually like highlight my inner
corner it works amazingly to get like
right under your brow and then you can
just like drag it down not being funny
I've been doing that
non-stop recently because I was getting
really frustrated with these like pencil
brushes that one really picking up
products and I couldn't really heart
make a corner and now I just can be
super precise just to finish off
underneath my eye and gonna take that
shade coconuts which is our initial
transition color on the crease police
brush but kind of really keep it towards
the top and just run that underneath
this is just gonna really it smoke it
out create a lot more offic here
sultry smoked out eye and that is the
shadow complete I'm now gonna go ahead
and do it mascara and lashes and the
lashes that I use these ones from pinky
go they're the exact ones that I used on
the
I think they're in the style Nora I'm
not sure then that she might go to ones
recently I thought I got my visa in a
previous video so yeah I'm gonna go
ahead and do mascara and lashes and then
we can move on to it so these are the
finished eyes with the finished skin
classic me you guys know I'm obsessed
with that bronze color and just the
general eye in general I love like a
sultry blown out smoky eye but now we
can move on to the lips and Phillips I'm
gonna take the skinny dip London flaming
hot matte lip color is this the mote you
can see I'm like well and truly loved
this it's like the most gorgeous red it
has a really precise nib too so I feel
kind of confident applying this without
a lip liner but be warned the product
comes out really quick so I just kind of
like place it on now how funny does that
look honestly these just glide on say
easily and the side of the nib is so
good they did it and like everybody
gorgeous pink color and like a darkish
nude but I was gonna pick the nude
option but then I thought you guys to
think bronze I need lip Rachel come on I
do kind of want to keep it like
signature to me because if it's
something that I was hosting so I
thought I'm gonna go with red hey what's
