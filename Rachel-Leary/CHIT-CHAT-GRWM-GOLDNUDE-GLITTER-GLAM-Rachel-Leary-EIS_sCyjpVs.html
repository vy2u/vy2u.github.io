hey guys welcome back to my channel
today I am recreating the look that I
recently posted on my Instagram you
don't follow me on Instagram it's just
at Rachel Eyrie so make sure you do I
posted this a picture because I was off
to my management Christmas party and
this is the makeup that I did for that
and so many of you guys asked for a
tutorial or just wanted to know what I
used so I thought I would do both and do
a tutorial there for showing you what I
used there are a few and new products in
here too which I hope you guys
appreciate but without further ado if
you like the look of this kind of a gold
nude glittery glam smokey eye look then
make sure to hit that thumbs up
subscribe and continue watching okay so
let's begin my skin has been feeling so
dry recently so dry so I've been loving
using my L'Oreal Hydra genius and
moisturizers I see a cult fave of mine
anything with the word hydro in is my
fave oh my god my lips are so sore just
putting that moisturizer on them to make
them release tingle so I may need to put
some vaseline on my lips so the next
thing that I use is kind of new
it is the Too Faced primed and peachy
cooling skin perfecting primer this also
smells in sane oh my god normally I
don't really like matte primers cuz I
like my skin to feel like really
hydrated and stuff but I've got quite a
lot of hydration from that moisturizer
and I liked the idea that this one was
gonna be like skin perfecting so I've
been loving using this and actually the
cooling sensation is really comfortable
underneath my makeup and that actually
makes it feel as if it it's more
hydrating than it actually is because
it's kind of like that silicone you feel
but no it has got like a wet feel to it
so this is like my kind of perfect
primer it's like skin perfecting it
mattifies your skin so normally
mattifying things make things last like
so much longer and then it also cools
perfects the skin loves it and I just
like to apply it with brush
simple foundation today I'm going to
take the nozzle a day at luminous
foundation in the shade sorry goose soup
sorry sorry use some other guys meaning
to talk one now this probably is
look of really dark and I did used to
have this foundation but I had it in the
shade Stromboli and that's just a little
bit well that was close it was just a
little bit too yellow so this one's a
bit more on the natural side I'm gonna
take the iconic London brush that I got
in my advent calendar it's like a fluffy
dome to oppression I'm just gonna use
that to initially buff in my foundation
but then I will probably go in with my
Beauty Blender now I know like I said
this might look really dark but I
promise it matches my tan and I'm
actually really turned oklahoman I fell
back in love with the Coco brown tan
their one hour Express in dark such a
lush palette lights so green base but
you can get sometimes that are kind of
more like red deep orange base but this
one is more of the green based how much
I definitely prefer I think you look a
lot more like golden and natural I love
this foundation because it's got such a
nice coverage to it like definitely
medium to full and it has such a
gorgeous glow as well but it actually
lasts all day
hence the all-day illuminance okay so if
we concealer I'm gonna take the top
shape tape in medium this is honestly
one of my favorite high-end consumers of
all time the coverage it's honestly
insane and when I was in LA if you
didn't know that I went to LA or like
insert a card or something for the vlog
so you can see what I had got up to but
they only sell shape tape in alters and
when we found we went to an altar we
found I literally bought so many and
stocked up massively if you haven't
tried it out hundreds that recommend
trying it honesty will change your life
and I think if you're from the UK you
can get it from QVC but I will see
questions about that I've never actually
ordered from QVC person I just know you
can get it from there but everyone's
always like do you trust it and I'm like
what ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
well why wouldn't you has any one of
people had like bad experiences ordering
from there let me know cuz I'll see when
I run out of shape tape I'm probably
going to order some and that'll be the
place that I can order okay now that is
done we're gonna go in with some cream
contouring products and you
my Rimmel insta duo contour stick in
dark love this you guys know I'm
obsessed with this and I'm pretty sure I
thought this was like a dupe for the Kim
kardashian-west Beauty contour things
I've never actually tried them but they
look pretty much the same so I'm just
gonna create the contour like lines with
this color and I actually been quite
liking to contour my nose and then I'm
just gonna take another shade of the
Tarte shape tape in the color deep this
is more of like a greeny greeny but like
a golden color
I don't know you can see that and I'm
just gonna do like literally a couple of
dots there and that's just gonna kind of
help blend everything together so to
blend out I'm just gonna take a like
stippling brush just kind of back and
see it just blends so beautifully into
the skin but actually I was so glad that
you guys wanted me to recreate this lip
and tonight because I'm actually going
to Jade's house tonight I mean I would
have been that already I would have been
that on Friday when I'm filming this and
it's now Sunday but she's having like a
big sleepover with like a bunch of us
bloggers because we were actually such
good friends and but then like we don't
really like do enough together do you
know I mean so she was just like hey I'm
gonna have a sleepover let's just eat
the chill out as like actually friends
and something that we've organized
ourselves so I'm so excited
did you know I nearly did the other day
I contoured like how I normally do I
completely forgot to blend out I blend
it everywhere else out except underneath
until like I was like looked in the
mirror outside knows that oh
don't forget to blend kids I'm actually
gonna take this new brush from iconic
London I got it in my Advent cover today
and how cool is it look I'm gonna use
that to blend out my nose consider and
see how that nose contour and see how
that goes no I think there's actually
might be better to apply it with rather
than blending a because it's such a
small precise brush but I like it that's
kind of all the creams that were using
for now so I'm gonna go ahead
and set my face with powder and this is
the Too Faced perfect peach mattifying
use powder whatever already I've just
opened this and the smell is so amazing
literal peaches and I'm tweeted the
other day I was like baking I've already
happened to me again now I might kind of
the loose powder was just like floating
there and it accidentally got in my
mouth tastes so good I've been loving
this brush as well this is the pro
sculpting brush from Sephora and just
kind of baking underneath my I am really
sharpening up all my contours I've got a
conch over the smell it smells so good
love that I just OH cut me up okay so
before we move on it to the rest of the
face I'm just gonna go ahead and do my
brows I promise you an updated brow
routine is coming using all the like
Anastasia products and stuff that she
personally used on me and all the
techniques and all that kind of stuff so
I'm gonna skip through it for now but
then I'll be back to do the rest of my
face just thought I'd show you like the
brows before and after well like I said
tutorial coming soon and now both brows
are done yeah do bring it your nails
okay so for bronzer I'm gonna take one
of my face this is the NYX no filter
powder in the color golden I think I
love this as a bronzer it's such a like
gorgeous warm under turn I'm just
basically gonna use that to warm up my
face just kind of where we place the
creamy bronzer e-products
come on mine I can't see I think I've
always said I think these powders are
like a dupe for the mineralized
skinfinish is they've got the same kind
of natural finish and now so pretty and
just to enhance my contour I'm gonna
take my trusty benefit hoola kabylie
duly just adds a bit of a cooler turn
darling sweetie honestly
snatched Wow let me second whip okay for
a shimmery bronze that you guys know I
love this is the beauty bakery
illuminator in the shade frozen I've
been loving this because again it's more
of a golden undertone than a lot of the
shimmery bronzer that I've got they can
be a bit more like red and this one is
just what Jana I love this for like
events and stuff it just gives you the
most gorgeous
JLo beyonce rhianna glow I I put this
everywhere like if I've got my chest out
on my legs out I'll just take a big
Brush and bathe myself in it pretty much
okay so for blusher in said I'm gonna
take this one from Milani it is called a
Bella blini that's some babe okay so for
my like liquid illuminator base today
I'm gonna take an old faith this is the
amok Jacobs do it drops in do you
haven't used us in a while so I just
like to pump a little bit on to at my
hand take a little brush and just give
it a quick brush and then very lightly
just apply that that's just gonna give
like a highlighter something to cling to
when we apply and they're just going to
make it extra bright and a blinding
going in with a nother old favorite this
is the Oprah highlighter in Rodeo Drive
and we're just gonna
holy hell put that on the top that's the
aim guys you want to create a highlight
so blinding that you actually choke on
it or someone actually jokes on that
whoa whoa whoa okay so that is the skin
it completed I'm now just gonna go ahead
and do one eye off-camera and then come
back and do it okay so for the eyes
today I'm taking the Too Faced just
peachy
matte eyeshadow palette they're all
matte shades so this is perfect for
traveling if you like a matte eye or
just like crease colors and I'm gonna go
with peach tea and peaches and cream at
first and like just mix them together as
my initial transition color again this
palette smells insane all to face
products smells so good oh not even
joking like let's see the chocolate bar
palettes literally smell like chocolate
too and the peach palettes did not come
to play I'm taking it all the way from
inner corner to outer corner cuz we are
gonna like cut the crease up loves it on
a a slightly a smaller brush I'm going
to be mixing again the peach tea but
this time with the peach picked color
sorry I've just looked at it it's called
fresh peach not peach picked I'm just
gonna use that to further deepen up the
crease I've been loving kind of using
the shade that I've used before would
like the next shade that I'm going to
use like mixing them together I think it
creates such a softer more natural blend
on the eye and between the colors
because you're obviously using the color
that you used see I feel like it just
makes it a lot easier for yourself I'm
then gonna mix the fresh picked color
with the peach cobbler color we are just
making always through these warmer
shades like I said it doesn't matter so
much of you're a little bit messy on
your lid because we are gonna be going
over it with concealer and it actually
looks a bit better the more product you
have on your eye when you're doing like
a half-cup quick look and then finally
I'm just gonna mix the peach cobbler
color with peach tart okay now we're
going to cut out the crease and to do
that I'm just gonna take the Nas soft
matte creamy concealer in canal and
that'll be back okay so just gonna head
and it carved up my crease and kind of
taken at pathway maybe like
three-quarters of the way across now for
the lid color today we are taking a
pigment from neve cosmetics it's called
a liquid mirror and honestly honestly
darling the nicest like the most
gorgeous champagne gold ever and i never
see anyone talk about this brand but I
always thought I'll it I love that
pigments they're some of the best that I
own like oh this would make a really
nice highlighter - maybe I'll pop some
on honest like how gorgeous is that goal
it's the pits for such a pale but
shimmery a gold I think this would be a
perfect for like brides and stuff
anything that would look so pretty I'm
now just going to take my fluffy brush
and that peach cobbler color which is
one of the medium transition shades that
we used and just diffuse it into crease
colors like so now you could totally
leave it that but it's the Christmas
party season and I want to be extra and
I'm gonna use glitter I'm sorry you know
so I'm just gonna use my Too Faced glue
to apply it and the glitter I'm going to
be using is from lip cosmetics is called
fully nude it looks like this and this
is in the size too so it's a little bit
more chunky
I wouldn't recommend doing this makeup
if you're like in your outfit because
the glitter does go everywhere but if
you that's why it's definitely a
must-have like set your face with powder
before because it's fallen onto my face
and because I've said it with powder I
can just brush it away it doesn't ruin
anything again I'm just gonna go in with
that peach cobbler color and just kind
of reinforce what I just did and then
I'm just gonna take that peach tart
color on its own which was the darkest
brown apply that and push that into my
lash line and just take up into my
crease a little bit and then just buff
that out girl
I'm now just gonna finish off underneath
the eyes and take the peach cobbler
color and just a buff that along my
lower lash line and then a little flat
brush with that peach tart color which
is the brown I'm just gonna push that in
to my lower lash line then for a little
added something in my waterline I'm
gonna take the Marc Jacobs high liner in
that sunset this is honestly one of my
favorite pencils pretty right so those
all the eyeshadow done I'm now gonna go
ahead and just apply it in the scar and
lashes and then I can initiate the
finished eyes so these are the eyes
finished where
lashes these are from Tassie lashes they
are in the style number four i literally
have been obsessed with these ever since
a mitchell did my makeup and he used
them on me and he was like oh my god
they're gonna change your life and they
literally have if you don't follow
Mitchell on Instagram he's literally
Mitchell but this like 4ms so you should
go and check him out his makeup skills
aren't same so to finish off the look
I'm obviously you're gonna be doing a
big fat gloss and need to do that I'm
gonna line my lips using the NYX suede
lip liner in London it's such a great
cool tone color to over line your lips
with okay and to fill in my lips I'm
gonna be mixing it to liquid lipsticks
together they are the jeffree star
mannequin and butt naked that was sent
to me by bu Shi Bay I'm just gonna take
the butt naked shade just only in the
middle slightly now you could keep it
matte if you want but I got this really
like exciting new at gloss today and I
really wanted to try it is the
colour-pop ultra glossy lip in moonchild
I was like dying to use this so I do
have a lot of oh yes I was saying I do
