today a slightly more relaxed video I'm
not so much gonna be talking through
products I just want to chat with you
guys I feel like there's a lot of stuff
going on there's a lot of things you
were asking me guys on and there's a lot
of stuff I want your opinions on so this
video is literally at me going like a
thorough it to a basic glam bitch and
just yeah going through everything that
I feel like I need till I feel you guys
in on let's just have a chat track you
know and let's get all right but before
we start it is personification bells
shut up time and this week it goes to a
Bethany Brown saying always have my bell
on snapchat and Instagram as well thank
you so much personally I love you it is
really appreciated and here is your
moment
ah but yes without further ado let's
just try guys let's do some makeup and
let's get started
hey hey let's go ahead and get started
so the first thing you actually notice
by the way I'm not gonna really talk
about products so much because this
video is just kind of like a church hack
and ready with me it's not so much a
tutorial you can kind of see the stuff
I'm using as I'm using it but I think
it's gonna be important then I'll say
what it is like I said the first thing
you might notice is that I have got some
lash extensions so again there's gonna
be kind of like a minimal eye makeup
tutorial just because I literally only
got them yesterday and she said that I
can wear makeup but like I don't want to
wear too too much anyway and I've been
kind of liking a more natural look
recently just kind of like matte shades
on the eyes like minimal warm tones that
kind of thing I've always wanted lash
extensions I've wanted to go to London
to get them done for ages there's a few
places in London I've been dying to go
which look insane lash extensions like
wet Jade pays gets her as it's like G's
unique like all those kind of places but
obviously it just takes like a little
while to Ferhat them to have them done
sidecar need to take the whole day out
because I don't live in London so I
found this girl locally to me just to
try them this is the first time I've
literally ever had my lashes done just
to make sure I'm not like allergic to
the glue so I know some people are but
so far I'm like loving the appearance of
them and I woke up this morning thinking
oh I got instant lashes which I'm loving
so I'm so glad you guys asked me to do
this kind of chitchat get ready with me
and video and it's the one that you
wanted me to do because I feel like
there's been like a lot going on with me
at the moment the biggest thing going on
is the fact that I am moving so I feel
like you guys are thinking that what
like why you mean even literally just
moved in to the flat that you're in like
a year ago and it actually will be a
year and a few weeks and it's nothing I
don't particularly want to move it's
just my landlord wants to sell it so
that's the problem with renting you
don't own the property so you can't
decide make those decisions for yourself
it's all made by them but I've literally
found the perfect place it's in a
slightly different area but on a sea the
layout of the flat is like identical to
mine at the moment but the place is just
like three points just a lot bigger than
what I've already got which is a maze
because what was the problem here was it
that there was I like I had no a storage
everything was always just like
overflowing for me I like I haven't had
a bath that doesn't mean I haven't
washed I just haven't had a bath like
since living here pretty much it
probably only had like two and that's
because I had literally is so much like
overflowing makeup and I just the only
place I could store it was in my bath
but now I've cleared all that up and
I've like set stuff aside and I'm now
that we're moving in the storage and I'm
so excited I feel like when I got the
call from my landlord to say like I'm
really sorry we're not gonna be renewing
your lease because we want to sell it I
thought I was gonna be really upset and
I was like oh my god like what am I
gonna do but I was actually I don't know
I'm kind of seeing it that's like
everything happens for a reason and as
you guys know like I'm single and
whatever and I'm kind of feeling maybe
this is like a sign that I'm gonna find
the person I'm gonna find like the right
person in this new town that I'm going
to because I kind of you know know like
know everyone in the town I live in but
you know I mean it's just one of those
things where I think I know everyone
that I would ever get to know and it's
just like no not that kind of thing so
yeah it's almost like a fresh start and
like I said I'm a strong believer in
everything happens for a reason so I'm
actually really excited it's been a
little bit of a long process but I just
I love a fresh start you know when you
get a new phone and sometimes everything
gets deleted
I normally quite like it when that
happens I like starting afresh and just
having a new beginning and no so I'm
like I'm really excited which also means
if you guys that they'll probably be a
new flat tour or like how yeah just show
you the new place I'm living in I'll
probably be going through a lot of my
makeup which I have been doing obviously
I just want to get rid of everything
that I don't want cuz I don't want to
take stuff I don't want to the new place
cuz what the hell's the point in that a
lot of you guys asked me if I was going
to be putting my makeup on depop and the
answer is no simply because not because
I don't want to or anything like that
it's just I could
tell you what I mean it's hard for me to
differentiate what I bought and what
I've been sent and to sell makeup you've
been sent is like it's almost like fraud
in the sense that I didn't pay for it
but I'm selling it for money so I can't
really be doing that I know some people
do and I don't know what they do in the
sense of with the money like even it
there because even if I was like oh yeah
I'm gonna put this all on depop and give
all the money to charity I'm still
selling something I didn't buy for money
even though I'm not keeping it if that
makes sense so it's not really something
you should be doing so unfortunately I
won't be putting it on it D but I do
keep like good stuff that I don't want
for giveaways but unfortunately stuff
that I've used that I don't want anymore
all I can do is just like throw it away
and it's like literally feels criminal
doing it but unfortunately I don't
really have a lot of other options
except I do give a lot to my friends
because I don't care that they're gonna
be using my makeup because these my
makeup all the time yeah so I'm super
excited to move I think that'd be really
fun so at the end of March is when I
plan to move and so if there's a lack of
videos that weep so sorry I will be
extremely stressed trying to sort that
out because I'm not just moving down the
road like I did last time
I'm moving like into another err like
another town so it's we're gonna take a
lot longer be a lot more stressful and
if you've ever moved house or like moved
out you know is literally one of the
most stressful times of your life so
hope you guys understand I might do
moving vlogs I don't know I always say
like I want to do these vlogs but they
they just don't really receive as well
you know like you guys always ask for
them but then I feel like nobody's
watching them I don't know they just get
the least amount of views on my channel
by the way I just use that new NYX cream
contour and that is a freaking of vibe
and a half I'm loving that I just used
that yeah it's a cream contour and I
brightened up underneath my eyes we're
gonna be looking quite tan today but
when are we not looking tanned am i
right okay so I just went ahead and
powder that into my brows because
the same-old same-old sister I used my a
th DEP brass set it in place and I pad
it again using the RT ma and no color
powder ever since you guys taught me to
use that I've literally can't stop using
it it's one of my faves I'm trying to
think before I answer the questions that
you guys set me in what else I wanted to
update you on already told you about how
I'm moving oh yeah if you didn't already
know if you don't follow me on Instagram
which I really want more of you guys to
do I feel like there's so much more of
you on here than there is my Instagram
and on Instagram we haves a lot of fun
so you should follow me on there but I'm
selling a lot of my clothes which I'm so
excited about I've been dying to just
get them away and just get them into a
place where they'll be used cuz I have
so many clothes that I just haven't worn
I've worn it once I just don't plan on
wearing it again so willing to go to a
better home a better place for that
actually be used so I'm using a service
called bloggers the smaller company took
my clothes away from me and they're
gonna kind of like do it all for me
which means they'll just take a
percentage of whatever but then like 5
percent of that money it goes to the
Teenage Cancer Trust so I thought oh my
god this is amazing
I physically turn up the time to set up
a depop and like send them all out and
do that myself as well as all the work
and the meetings and everything like
that so I probably would have got
someone in to help me do that anyways
and then this way percentage of it goes
to charity so I feel like even better so
they took the clothes from me today so
I'm hoping they'll go up in the next
week you should probably follow them on
Instagram as well they are e underscore
bloggers or just e bloggers I'm not sure
but I would have linked it on my
Instagram of stories and I probably will
be posting about it obviously or when it
goes live it's still really nice stuff
like it says of party dresses body suits
play suits jump suits jackets there's
some shoes there as well just all stuff
that I've kind of already worn or just
like don't plan on wearing again so
therefore it's just kind of sitting
there there's nothing like wrong with it
or anything like that and pretty much
most of it I like bought myself so it's
all fine
I don't really get sent too much clothes
so that's exciting so if you guys feel
like you have a similar style to me or
like we're the same size and clothing
then definitely check the maps obviously
there'll be a discounted prices so a
little butter for you guys okay so I'm
just gonna kind of finish off doing the
face I'm going to start answering your
questions so
Francesca Flynn that said how did you
get into YouTube and do you ever regret
it what would your what would you name
your own brand um how do I get started
on YouTube and people just used to ask
me a lot of questions about makeup like
I have always really been into makeup I
always used to take the makeup from
magazines and put it on and wear makeup
to school and like nobody else really
word and always go above and beyond when
it came to like parties and stuff and
then I just got like a lot of questions
on it in the sense of people like oh my
god how did you do that cuz it wasn't so
much of a big thing when I started like
watching makeup tutorials wasn't like a
massive thing although I remember coming
home from school and I'd be is so
excited to watch like my favorite people
on new treatment watch their tutorials
so I just feel like you know what if
people are asking at least that's like
someone's gonna watch it you know I mean
like I wasn't going in with no one
wanting to watch my videos even if it
was just like my friends at school and I
did photography at school and part of
doing photography was like using iMovie
and like editing photos and all that so
I've always really been into that side
of things as well and I kind of just put
two and two together I thought why the
hell not like let's just make a video
and luckily for me I found it really fun
or whatever my first video of CGI so
dude like that well but that second
video and I didn't know what to do or
like what to post and then ariana grande
just released a song and her makeup in
the video looked so pretty and I'll say
I only got a bet you anything people are
gonna be searching for that because it
was like really natural but put together
so the second video I am a posted was an
ariana grande inspired makeup tutorial
literally the day after she dropped that
video and it worked the logic works like
people obviously searching for it that
came up it was a side by side picture
people wanted to click on it and it just
kind of snowballed from there it's all
about timing I feel like and just
following the trends and just doing what
people want to see but I can't really
like explain anything else and then I
just started producing more content and
people obviously were liking it and the
rest is kind of history I don't know I
don't ever really regret it I mean I do
sometimes in the sense that kind of this
is my only job and I know it's not fair
so like what what will I do if you know
or not going to tits up but like
something happens and it's all not here
but I feel like I definitely know what I
would do I think I definitely go into
the PR side of things and marketing and
all that kind of stuff with all this
kind of experience I feel like I'd be
good at it
yeah and what would you name your own
brand holy hell
I haven't really thought about that cuz
the opportunity hasn't really come up I
mean I don't have anything other than my
name like cosmetics beauty better my
name is just like Rachael Larry and
nothing really begins with R or L to
have like a solid ring to it and that
makes sense so I literally don't know
but my goals for this year are a hundred
percent to collaborate with a brand and
bring out products for you guys so I
feel like that's what you want from me I
tried the match thing like any of you
guys didn't know I do have match but I
did get rid of a lot of it because I
wasn't really like happy I liked having
a but that's not what I want to bring it
like that's what you want for me I'm
like a beauty influencer and like yeah
it's nice to have like merch and that's
why I have kept some I kept the pink
hoodie because I'd literally live in it
but it's so comfortable with you haven't
got it yeah and you're in the market for
a new hoodie I didn't love it I has like
my lips on it so I do like there's some
elements that I love and like the phone
cases and stuff but I don't know I
thought I go just produce too too much
too quickly and I wanted to take a step
back and say like no this isn't the
direction I want to go in I don't want
brands to look at me and just think oh
she's got her own merch and it's just
merch and she's going down that path
because I want to go down the cosmetics
path I want to bring out my own products
whether it's in collaboration with
Simone which is that I want to do first
rather than creating my own makeup line
though yeah
so if you haven't already like I said
you can check out my remaining match in
the link down below and we will see what
happens this year I definitely have some
very exciting meetings planned which I'm
excited to see where they go or what the
result of and they of them are but in
terms of names of brands so I just
realized they weren't on a completely a
different tangent
no I wouldn't like to be anything too
complicated obviously something with my
name Julie at NASA says do you wear
makeup every day
um no definitely not I mean especially
if I'm not really doing much that day
but I won't stress my skin out I will
say though I find it very hard to like
not do my brows because I usually have
like no brows and they've really
considered getting the micro bladed if
any of you guys have had the micro pain
if so let me know your experiences with
that in the comments below
please I've seen some up places that do
them it's like so natural and I'm so
tempted to do it their parent really
hurts I I kind of forgot the whole like
name is micro bleeding so obviously
there's like blades involved I've seen
so many people like get it done so I
don't know let me know if you've had it
done of it's worth it I've seen a place
called kiss esthetics do it obviously
they also do cosmetic procedures as well
but they do really natural microbe
loading of brows I really like the look
at them so I don't know I don't know I
also kind of want to get some cosmetic
procedures I know I'm such a guys
like I don't think I actually need word
but my nose is really starting to piss
me off like I don't think you can see it
but I just have like a bump in my nose
that I always like want to edit in
pictures like get rid of it and stuff
and I just think like oh like I'd just
be so much happier if it was just
permanently not like that and it's not
worth getting a full-blown nose job for
it believe me it's not because it's
everyone's always like Rachel what the
hell you talking about but I've seen
like obviously you can get non-surgical
non-surgical nose jobs which is just
like where they put like a bit of filler
in your nose I really think I would like
that but like I feel like I'm just such
a person if it went wrong I just hate
myself because it's not so much of a big
issue but I know some girls have had it
done and they said it's like the best
thing they ever did and that they really
like feel so much better so if any of
you guys I mean if you guys ever had
that but I literally I'm so tempted and
I thought I've definitely found some
like good and trusted places but again
they just like nowhere near me so just
means I'd have to go up to London on my
own and it just is a little bit daunting
you know let me know what you guys think
about that kind of stuff another thing
and I've spoken about I really want to
sort my teeth out not for vanity reasons
guys like I wouldn't want to get veneers
just
so I've got veneers I actually have a
lot of issues with my teeth which I can
do a video on if I actually go and stop
being so terrified at the dentist and
get them done yeah I know a lot of
people just get veneers just so their
teeth look better which I'm so on board
with because teeth are like so important
I teeth don't look like awful but that's
not the point it's like I actually I
will need work done on my teeth at some
point it's just whether or not once I
get that work done should I just even
them out and get like some veneers as
well you know I mean so again let me
know if that's something you're
interested in because if I know you guys
like interested in this stuff then I
might be motivated to actually do it I
know that you guys aren't gonna think
badly of me
oh my god not being funny just having
lash extensions means my makeup is done
like so quickly Lauren Denton said what
are your goals this year any upcoming
projects with personal projects coming
up that you can tell us about not I can
tell anyone about in a sense that it's
not signed sealed delivered and I'm not
gonna jinx it or anything like that I
definitely have some exciting stuff in
the pipeline which is so so safe those
those days they they it's better for
sorry so excited that I burps I'm like I
think you guys gonna be so excited for
as well but yeah oh you can obviously
tell you things as and when I can and I
know this one Jess says what songs you
listen to at the moment because I can't
stop hold on I can't stop listening to
that song that goes you're mine turns on
your body I don't wanna waste no time
you know it's such a like shower singing
song I can't stop singing it so okay
