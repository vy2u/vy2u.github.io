off as I would like literally getting
ready like my hair is still wet I got
out the shower about ten minutes ago you
can't touch my hair like I'm going
ashore literally like what I want to do
with my face today but I know I'm gonna
start with my fixes to the Kampala to
moisturize properly oh yeah
like loads of you gave me such good
response and like my last chatty videos
so I thought I would do another chatty
video that obviously incorporates that
makeup into it as well would you like
some sort of golden summary get ready
with me type thing while I chat to you
about an a like my weekend and what up -
Wow
first we're going to pry my skin at
using the NYX first face primer
I'm just really it's so hot at the
moment anything that's like gonna give
me moisture and like call me down I'm
like obsessed so I can't be bothered to
post toast well put like creams my face
literally just sit in the heat I can't
do that I just push that into my skin
yeah so Friday me and my friend Chloe
thought I'd be like a really good idea
to go out even though we'd really picked
up going out the next night oh not a
good idea I don't know if you guys saw
my snapchats or anything was a crazy
night so I can say she ended up getting
thrown out now little Chloe really do
crap me but then I'm going to go in with
the ex1 invisiblur foundation should I
have not used this in it for ever and
this is in the shade f200 I'm just going
to buff that into my skin yes we ended
up going out on Friday
and like took it way too far like we
normally do I see me and my friends they
say well not quite not yet really really
isn't like we always take it too far
like we have a group chat at least I got
quoted it on Twitter and there's like 12
of us on there and just that when were
like not all out together or like we are
but all in separate locations or
something we're trying to like
communicate with each other but we're
all so unwell we can't do it and it just
ends up being like an argument there's
always a drunken argument over that chat
like every weekend I don't know do you
guys have those kind of group traps of
your friends but honestly hmm there's a
funniest thing everyone on that chat we
just always we just take it too far
safer then on Saturday I went to I'm at
and it was so so lovely to meet so many
of you and obviously shot some makeup I
think I might do an IMATS haul I didn't
get like loads of stuff but if you guys
would be interested in that let me know
in the comments below and I'll do that
for Thursday if not then I'll just start
like unpacking all in all and just start
using it in tutorials but if you just
wanted to see what I got then I'll do
that ya know like I said it was so good
to see so many of you and obviously I
got to see Holly I got to see tails I
loved them too that just as someone has
made it and we all turned up we were
like oh they thought me so tired then I
got back and it went out on Saturday as
well I read her my ideas to myself
honestly like because I had work the
next day I just love a good party
or like going out I'm only adding a tiny
bit more because um there's a bit on the
uneven ended it's just cuz it's a brush
that I'm using or whatever but not to
add more coverage or anything because
this um one has a really nice sort of
like medium coverage I don't want it to
make it really full I really like this
foundation you know the problem with how
is it's such a crap problem to have and
it's not really even a problem but
having a lot of makeup you forget the
stuff that you've got I forgot about
this one love it
moving on to concealer which one do I
want to use I might use the Urban Decay
Naked skin just because I've been really
liking this at the moment because it
really brightens up my under eyes and
I've been so tired recently I like I
really really struggled to sleep I don't
know what it is
none I used to be like the best sleeper
ever like I could sleep through anything
like my fire log my fire alarm for golf
and I probably wouldn't hear it like I
was such a deep sleeper and then
recently I don't know what it is just I
like to look a lot on my mind or
something I just really struggled to
sleep or it might be the temperature god
it's so hot like humid in England at the
moment just what I don't know if it's
seemed everywhere but I love it's so
humid and like I just toss and turn and
like I'm up every 40 minutes or every 10
minutes or something just changing
positions rolling over and so hot and I
just my mind doesn't shut up so you guys
have any tips or like you guys listen to
things while you go to sleep I used to
put my headphones in while I slept
and I Parry that's quite bad but it was
the only way I could get like my mind to
shut up like was to block out so I put
headphones in and then like well I was
half asleep during the night like I'd
obviously just managed to take them
chuckling to the side and I would always
help me but I what told it was bad so I
stopped doing it
I can't imagine like waking up and put
your headphones that wrap around your
neck look can't breathe feeling
sufficiently brightened I'd say I'm
gonna think what I think I'm gonna go
for quite a natural eye but I'll
probably put lashes on because me and
that's still natural for me so I'm doing
my skin first
so before I powered anything I'm going
to go in with the Giorgio Armani oh
fluid shear in number 10 and I'm just
going to use this as like a not like a
cream contour more like a cream bronzer
I'd say just dust it where I would
normally dust it what the hell like you
know blend it I would normally apply
like my bronzer this has such a gorgeous
shimmer to it I know like when I'm gone
holiday and when I'm on holiday and I
need like darken up my foundation I want
to feel it more glowy I know this is
going to be one of those products I'm
going to mix into the skin oh my god I'm
really not making sense
mix into my foundation to make my skin
you know more glowy and stuff it doesn't
add a huge amount of color which I quite
like it just adds kind of a glow the
places that I'd like to glow you know
also recently I've been posting a lot
more fashion a based pictures and I
think I want to incorporate a bit more
fashion eBay stuff on my channel so let
me know if you guys would like try on
hauls and like look books and stuff
because that is another element I'm
really interested in like for instance
if you care this lace bodysuit is from
misguided from a source but you know
misguided actually Anna you didn't
really add a huge amount of color
I kind of do want some color now Berlin
I am going to take the LA girl Pro
conceal in beautiful bronze and I am
going to use this to kind of cream bones
be contour quite a lot one sets just
let's take it easy right I just use the
same brushes I did before
oh I did that too much fun oh my god
okay I'm just gonna stare for about 20
minutes
holy moly I'm going to be bronzed today
that's fine I don't turn naturally
anyway yeah oh my god so I've got a
couple of holidays but this year one of
them I literally booked the other day
with my best friends and it's at the end
of this month so I'm feeling very like
honored and I'm not prepared for it
whatsoever basically decided like over
19 now that were kind of over those kind
of party holiday type things they still
want to go to somewhere that has a good
night life because well like I said boys
up for going out and stuff but we didn't
want to go anywhere what we said we
didn't want to go anywhere to mint or
anything like that
we decided I'm going to really nice
hotel in Palma Nova I don't know if you
guys know that is a thing basically I
found out 500 meters away from aguilas
so with all intentions are not going to
a party on a poverty holiday I basically
am but I did say to my friends that
nobody wants to film it like let me know
if you guys the interest in this I kind
of wanted to film like no nights out or
anything that we weren't meant to be
having that sort of holiday but it was
more like we were gonna I just wanted to
put like a montage together of like
outfits and just like what made my
friends do it
friends outfits and clips of my friends
you guys and kind of get to know them
too clippings that'd be quite nice so
and like it kind of would just be maybe
a few bits of me talking and stuff but
mainly just like a video like music over
the tops of something more arty rather
than tutorial talky Bloggie bass so let
me know if you'd it would actually like
to see that because they're quite up for
it so if you want to see it let me know
yeah that's kind of all the cream
products I think I want on my face so
now I'm just gonna go ahead and set with
powder so as always I'm gonna set my
skin using the laura mercier translucent
powder i did buy a new translucent
powder at IMATS that i'm excited to try
but what is that yet in case you guys
want to see it in the whole person then
i'll start using it so maybe i will
switch it up but it's honestly in the
summer time I could feel like I'm
dripping with sweat look in the mirror
and still be matte because this powder
is so good at just keeping your skin
matte so I'm just going to not
necessarily bake but just kind of press
this in the areas that I find get like
prone to do enos the quickest so that's
normally like the size of my nose I'm
also going to set my concealer so I'm
going underneath my eyes as well my chin
area
my forehead as well sorry if you think
this is similar to like load my other
skin like face tutorials like I am
literally getting ready for this is I'm
using stuff that I know looks good and I
know works and stuff so I'm also just
gonna set my whole face so any powders I
put on the top blend a look easier and
don't like cling to any fluids but like
creams on the skin or obviously whenever
I put up a video and stuff my friends
watch it and they're like um like rock
sometimes I like comment on something or
ever and on my real me video which oh my
god I got such good response and that I
need to go back over the comments so by
the way I'm using the peaches and cream
bronzing powder in light/medium with joy
fiber brush but um loads of you or
actually I think there was like one
coming that like quite a few likes and
it was basically saying I they wanted me
to do story time videos of when I go out
and stuff I read it I don't know what
impression I must give off I vote my
lies that they are really funny and like
I have had some really really funny
nights out but my friend Alex like I
know you might watch this so hey Alex
he screenshotted that comment and sent
it to me and said you need to tell the
story of when we all went to Brighton
for New Year's oh my god sighs honestly
it's such a funny story but only I feel
like Alex fellow you need to be in this
that video when I tell it because you
were the main reason why it was so funny
like I've got videos from it like where
we've made snapchat stories and like
save the snapchat stories because
honestly if I like I need to relive that
when I'm sad like it's honestly so funny
cuz like I said my friends they just
take it too far but when I say too far I
mean like it's funny too far like we're
weird
we're a crazy group of people especially
Alex
and then push me yeah I'm going to go in
with the NARS sex-appeal blusher which
looks really light but it gives such a
nice kind of warmth to the skin
so yeah you aren't this video is
basically me giving you video
suggestions and you telling me yes or no
but I feel that's how I'll I don't know
what you guys want to see but honestly
it is quite funny and I will insert some
of the videos if they're like acceptable
I feel like you guys are finally like I
need to go on up a night out Han and
like film that they're funny too she
does this thing like when she gets
really drunk I'll just look at her and
she'll go like that and I'll be like oh
my god you can't see and I say that a
lot I'd say but I'm drunk I said I can't
see right I can see like their visions
just it's not there so many people what
I don't know them and I say that like
they don't get it and I forget that they
don't get it because it's like me and my
friends is like things that we say like
oh my god I can't see also I go really
new I can't talk either
you know sometimes like it's just effort
so that open your mouth and start
talking so I just stand there in silence
never ones that Rachel you're right none
like to highlight my skin I'm using the
Kiko 208 eyes shadow on a fan brush good
a bit more a bit more so I'm going to
take the sleek solstice highlighting
palette on a morphe m51 one gab gab gab
and looks please just buff that on the
top mmm
so I think that's my skin gun now I'm
going to do my eyebrows off camera just
because I promise I will do an eyebrow
tutorial very very soon but I'm gonna do
my eyebrows off camera and then we'll
move on to the eye makeup so eyebrows
done and I've zoomed you in a bit more
but I've literally use my anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow and medium brown
as I always do but yeah now I'm gonna go
ahead and apply a little bit of primer
to my eyes this is the Urban Decay
Eden one I'm obsessed it's like Mac soft
ochre but a bit more creamier a bit more
easy to blend so all most of you like in
exams at the moment I never know cuz
I've seen like I don't go to school
anymore
and I'm not surrounded by people
actually a lot of people come back from
university so I'm assuming those kind of
exams and then if you're all doing like
your GCSEs your a-levels let me know how
they're going I kind of I'm saying to my
mum in a day I'm weirdly miss revising
like I know I was actually doing it like
I really wouldn't miss it but I miss
having like something to do like the
pressure I quite like working under
pressure sometimes makes you work a bit
harder you know yeah let me know how
they went right and things of that
powder and then obviously if you're
going back in the patterns on the top it
just makes everything blends easier and
I really look like I just thrown that
everywhere that's because I have and
that was unintentional yeah loads of you
guys requested me to film that makeup
that I did yesterday so I might do that
next week I think but I'm just going in
with the peaches bronzer as my initial
transition color in my sockets people
are quite rounded today I think yeah the
more and more I think about um
these like the story time videos I think
they'd be quite funny like getting my
friends on or like something and
discussing the notes out that we passed
I get to take this Anastasia Beverly
Hills I shadow in party dress which is
essentially just a slightly deeper brown
I really don't think I'll have any more
colors into the cruise I think we'll
just keep it very soft also I have been
loving oh I've been loving Justin Bieber
at the moment I did all it is I got all
my YouTube and like all these songs keep
popping up that he's done and I didn't
even realize like that one dance remix
and then there's one could wind it
that's got tory lanez in it and I love
Tory Lanez
and that one's so good to give them a
listen if you're you think you might
like the same kind of music as me I keep
getting these emails same loads of U of
M subscribe to my Spotify playlist any
that's funny now for the lid shade I
think I'm going to use makeup geek after
go I have not used this in forever and I
love it it's like my favorite mole like
I don't know why I'm using purposively
so be obsessive it's such a gorgeous
shimmery gold color and you look pretty
right now then I'm going to go back in
with the brush that we use that party
dress I shadow on and just kind of
diffuse it and by I'm going to take a
pencil brush and that same party dress
color and just run that along my lower
lash line to tie it all in together see
I feel like if you put like um a
complementary color underneath your eyes
so for me that they're kind of like
orangey tones just really makes your
eyes pop I'm going to go back in with
the sleek palette and just take um
a pencil brush again and just take the
champagne II kind of colored one as my
inner corner highlight all that what the
hell's happened ROG oh well kind of work
with it yeah I shall know me better oh
yeah that angle rickets
that'll be donkey right I'm gonna go
ahead and apply mascara this is the
Maybelline at last little bitty lash
sensational luscious with the oil blend
mascara and then I'll be back because
it's me and I am gonna provide false
lashes but they are natural ish I
promise obviously you can just stop here
but no one wants to see applying scarf
sex mooring so yeah next this is the
eyes with just mascara on
I'm obsessed as described and if it's
just cuz it's called like oil blend in
it or what but I find it really really
conditions my lashes and if I was just
wear my scar on its own it'd probably be
this one but I've got these lashes here
and I kind of look at them on basically
I'm going to be wearing red cherry 5 to
3 es which looks like like this but I've
stuck individuals on at the end I told
you guys I'm obsessed with like
customizing lashes at the moment it's
like one of my favorite things to do
they're still kind of drying but I mean
they have a clear lash plant and that
kind of makes them natural right I'm
kind of feeling that nude golden brownie
type the vibe so I think I'm gonna go in
with my stripped down
pencil finished then I'm going to go in
with Jeffrey star I'm need just because
this is quite a light peachy tone need
color
I'm just going to go back over a little
bit kind of want it to be a bit more
golden I'm going to go in with the Kiko
highlighter again though and just I let
my cute oh haha high IQ his boy I think
I'm going to go in with this lipgloss
from sleek in the color fool's gold
mm-hmm mm-hmm don't add any more or
debate whether to put this super gloss
by Kiko on top because it's super
sparkly I'm going to do it I'm going so
sorry that the caption says then the
title says natural mm-hmm
I'm finished that's actually pretty
quick for me you know I mean I still
have to do my hair but I'll not do that
I'm just maybe I'll straighten it maybe
I'll burn it up
that'll do well so this is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it just something really kind of
nude still a bit glam summary type vibe
my kind of look um I really if you guys
