new followers and subscribers hello the
ones I've been following me for ages you
guys know it I've just moved into my own
flatness the first and you're I'm
filming in my new flat so this why the
background is just plain white right now
I might keep it this way depending on
how the video turns out I'm not sure but
I'll probably get some colored stuff
going on and now I want to film in like
my more relaxed chatting videos and like
my lounge my bedroom instance so get
ready for those but today I went to some
a trip check it ray with me I'm about
well not about to go but later on I am
going to the mix store opening and
Wessel of Stratford's and you guys know
and Knicks opposing their own standalone
store in the Westfield Stratford so from
tomorrow you'll be able to shop all
things Nixon Montaigne that's enough I'm
gonna get lower the bus from your job to
me being I'm ready and you can get ready
with me and I did it this PG next area
look using the newer color pop nectar
collection I don't use all of it I just
created something that I would wear to
an event and stuff with this new stuff
they come up with it obviously if you
guys have ordered any of it then I hope
this gives you inspiration so if you
like the look of this makeup look then
make sure to give it a thumbs up and
please continue watching
okay so to begin I think I want to go oh
my god adjuster I'm all over the place
I'm doing like a wind
look I stink so I'm going to go hop
ahead and do my eyes first and to point
my eyes I'm going to use the peaches and
cream eyeshadow primer this is I really
like the songs it's got a really nice
flesh tone to it you have to excuse me
I'm a little bit all over the place
because everything literally is all over
the place and I've already said this
isn't going to be my like permanent
setup I'll have like a noted backgrounds
and then for different types of videos
I'll be a bit more like casual maybe my
lounges and things but yeah I'm going to
move my maricella closer to me so I'm
just going to go ahead and prime my eyes
you can see it's a flesh tone color yeah
I'm getting ready to go to the next
store opening this evening which I think
will be a really really fun so much
people have not seen an artsy ages
because I feel like I've not seen like
anyone in ages this look so much for
like I issues I think it works but I be
learned in a bit more if sing day yeah
doubt works Allah that also got to start
with the American accent I know because
all my near my friends do it all the
time so if you guys my friend so I do
the same thing with you this feels so
weird sorry I'm I've been getting like I
feel so lost I don't know anything it
like I do but it's just not where it
like it used to be if that makes sense
so I feel really loved because literally
straight after I've done this I'm gonna
have to go back to my old house anyways
because I need to use the Wi-Fi to be
able to like upload then oh my god I've
got so much on my hand I'm going to work
that summer I'm going to go ahead and
get my tire irons and whites and Stefan
then I'll give you back alrighty so now
I am just going to set that in place
with a powder is such a free nice day
outside living King so sunny also I've
not done like foreground in age because
all my makeups thin everywhere I like
all over the shop so how can we
forgotten how to do now I'm going to go
ahead and do my eyebrows and that I'm
going to use be a benefit precise brow
pencil in the shade number four and then
you
Anastacia double dip brow and soft brown
to do with the tails of my brows I just
like to like raise the brow and then
like just trace underneath just remember
like that really tighten up the skin and
now I'm going to do the same on the top
just kind of with the pants we'll stop
about here and then just fill in the
main bodies also my hands look really
like orange bear with me I'm removing
maintaining my turn has not been on the
top of my to-do list
but then I'm just going to feather out
with the pencil at the front like so and
then yep just take a strong little
angled brush this is the Sigma one I
love this one and just do the table like
that I'm now going to go ahead and just
really quickly do provide you know what
I'm doing and as to be quite quick
because I'm going to do even after this
so I'm going to go ahead and do the
other brow and then the other eye off
camera and then I'll be back to if they
might did and all of that get it step
and do the rest of the face
okay we are back with the brow and then
I done I love this it's NXP and pretty
so recently I got my hands on it via
color pop next to collection I'd snap
gesture and said she wasn't deer look
and then if you said yes so just having
a play around with some of the products
that they came with I'm going to start
with the argument they came with it's
just three cordia's matte peachy shades
and a shimmery shades you could probably
do the whole look with this I am just
going to use the matte colors with this
one I'm going to take this color here
and I'm not sure it is called issues so
it's gonna be soft peachy color and I'm
going to take that on a fluffy brush and
to suppress that into my crease and our
initial color I love color book
eyeshadows I have a whole pile out there
I'm actually going to use some other
color publish shadows that didn't come
with this collection but I think I need
to like one or something just to deepen
up the crease and add a bit more warmth
because these are all quite pinky shades
oh that's the whole kind of concept
than that to me I like me to be a tiny
bit more on the warmer side so I'll just
use that I actually no idea what the
audio of this is going to sound like
because we'll see in a different run and
all that stuff I don't actually have an
external mic I just use the ones that
are literally built into the camera so
you'll have to bear with me I'm going to
take clear second darkest animal stage
and making my way through all the matte
shades with this but these are such
pretty colors
obviously if you have like brown eyes or
green eyes even this would look even
more stunning just because their cousin
isn't really going to make your eyes pop
I'm all about that that's why I love
doing one look so much and it really
accepts what not like upsets me that
what I think comments saying you do or
the same look so that you use all the
same colors and I mean I know I have to
be diverse but why would you want to put
something when you're either but it
doesn't suit you
and I'm thought about like enhancing the
natural beauty and I feel with my eye
colors like warmer colors and orange
colors make my partner's when I wanted
it right 9x color so just taking a
smaller fluffy brush from the same
palette just the darker peachy pink you
color you are actually berry pink which
is mental if I've seen loads of like
peach Corrections which like the two
phase one and two very heartening um
another one there that one springs to
mind peach peach peaches organ peach and
colorful I think has been quite clever
they're sticking with the same kind of
theme they've gone with more like an
excerpt in cell anemia like peaches yeah
they said it's more like a next color
and to me one of you know next driving
like holiday the flowers I think of that
that like um flower mode you know the
one that Drake's the new things to
promote like more life and stuff I can't
remember what this either called Bellus
really tropical that's kind of my thing
loading an extra and that is more pink
so yeah it's definitely not peach hey
little March engineer right today all
the kind of cruise colors I'm going to
use them now but I'm going to take this
super super super soft super shock
shadow in the color flipper which came
with the collection and then I'm going
to take a little bit of like a eyeshadow
base type thing just like a mixing
medium because do you come up are
shadows they do they are really really
pretty so I'm just going for brush and
they are really really pretty but I feel
like they work really well with a base
underneath and then it she's just gonna
put a lot of I'm mixing medium just on
my lid where I want it to go and then
take a little bit of a slipper color and
just pack that on so pretty yeah these I
think work really nicely when you use
your finger with them as well actually
you could burn a little bit and yeah
they were really delicate cream to
powder
feel so yeah they were going onto like a
really little brush or your finger and
then I'm going to take this single
eyeshadow and this also came with the
collection but I'd like a single shadow
called cut out and I'm just going to use
that to diffuse the crease color into
the lip colors I'm just taking like a
short shader brush this is a sigma short
shader chords and it's the e 20 and I'm
just going to just kind of press between
them just to get a really nice blend
going on not have to learn another
little of it and then I'm going to take
this color which is called popular
demand this didn't come with the
collection but I am just going to need
it to further deepen up the crease
slightly just a little brush and I'm
using this just because it's actually I
don't know if you could really tell but
I held it up but if you happy if I
shadow or if you google the swoosh
screech you're interested in if I show
you'll see it's actually more like a
pinky Brown really really gorgeous if
you've got like I keep saying green eyes
with your mind's eye Swiss chocolate Mac
so think of it like that so it works
really nicely with our pink tones that
were using increase already and one so I
just watched and what to Expect When
You're Expecting I keep going home and
like downloading
films and then bring them across the
flux I haven't got Wi-Fi here yet
actually as you can probably imagine the
bane of my life that I'm pretty sure my
phone bill is astronomical and my mom
hates me so sorry Maria and that yeah
and oh my god I if I got all-star cast
and I love those kind of films like an
all-star cast musical rom-com type thing
and try to watch the other night by lip
she just passed out and fell asleep with
my friend Chloe and then I woke up and
she Doris she already like she'd managed
to stay awake and watch the whole thing
so it's just catching up and it's really
good if you've not watched it and really
good seem to work for me more like a
Sunday evening type thing but it was so
good and now I'm just trying to find a
new series don't judge me but I just
downloaded loads of episodes of is it
called Bad Girls Club and I've literally
just watch that in Java and oh my god I
really think like it's going to be one
of those things I'm going to really like
but like it's going to be like a secret
how much I like it but I'm just hitting
the white and it caming up the edge of
that because that's all because show no
dumb now I'm just going to take the
highlights that I plan to use which is
from laura geller it is called peach
glow which I thought was appropriate and
we're going to use that to highlight my
inner corner this collection does come
with a highlighter but I plan to I think
use them both but you're just going to
drop that in lastly I'm now stand and do
my liquid eyeliner but because of the
way the tape was situated I have to do
it really like so it was not going to be
working me if coming up you guys see me
do eyeliner and you guys would see me do
I know now much of the time so I'm going
to go ahead and it is now and then I'll
do a Mac I mean now I'm just going to go
ahead and apply mascara just a little
coke with of birds and it puts their
falsies on my lashes has like gotten
actually really quite long because I've
not really been wearing any makeup for
the past few days because I've been
moving and it's just not been on the top
of my list
my skin had such a nice break but the
lashes I'm going to wear the the Lily
lashes in goddess I still like either
actually by just looking at them
I feel like I've put them in the wrong
box which is very deep and I
hide it when I do that because I can't
tell you I think just from my beauty
knowledge that these might be the
opulent ones and actually I know
Amy hopes to wear the orange ones well
I'm pretty sure they look like this so
I'm just going to apply some glue to
this just so we're getting ready for an
event like so early on in the day but I
wanted to film this and then I've also
got to somehow straighten my hair but I
strengthened on either at home or do you
want my mum to bring them across time
tonight texture I'm happy violin
brilliant what words do i do what do i
do god what am i doing
really the gun is gonna leave it just
wait for the master to dry I might add a
tiny bit more of that doggie brownie
colour just in there Kristin that's
exactly what I wanted to do
hey actually while the lashes are drying
I might apply a primer this is I left my
draw and all my moisturizer and primers
in at home like that
the wonder I forgot mastering all over
except one so this is the only problem
I've got here and is the hourglass
mineral day one and I was watching twe
on snapchat I don't know you guys were
twins not sure if you love snapchat and
like you want you only want to follow
people that I like chatting to you all
day every day updated every night are
doing follow twi'lek I feel like I keep
up with a cut whole life on snapchat
you've always done snapchat tutorials
I'm so like jealous of her of how much
time she like to set aside to do these
tutorials and stuff for everyone but she
was raving about this primer I knew but
I had it but I just don't know how good
it was so I'm trying it out again she's
buffing that in let's pop the rushes on
them I'm kind of primal yes I wanted a
pair of lashes that was like still kind
of dramatic but and not so full but you
can't see what's going on on the lip
because
I am loving with guns it right now looks
at a mystery peachy
Sansa yes okay so that should go dry so
I'm going to go ahead and apply it
Foundation and I'm going to use the
Maybelline gooey and smooth like if the
fit me doing smooth one I know I
purchased this when I was in America
I've not seen it in the UK yeah I feel a
cop see it will come at some point it
might just be a different packaging I'm
just going to take my Beauty Blender and
press that into my skin I'm using the
shade 240th golden beige because it
matches my turn and that's the color I
would rather be I've been in the tree
only wearing drugstore foundations at
moment I feel like they're they're
stepping up their game you know I mean
I'll see Georgia online will 4s be a
fave of mine but no recently I just feel
like the drugstore undergone it got a
going on and then just gonna try once
more just everywhere really with the
sponge now we can do our concern no
surprises to consider I'm going to use
is be a heart-shaped tape it's literally
my favorite FSA's hi and concealer it's
just got such amazing and it doesn't
crease it's rehydrating you've been
thinking about getting it I recommend
just do it the color I've got is to
shade light/medium and I've had this for
so long use it all the time and still
going with it like it's just so good so
good is coming needy you and I just like
to take a little brush and just go
really tightly up against the eyeliner
that means I don't have to put like the
sponge that close I can be a bit more
precise with it I bet I'm gonna take the
Beauty Blender again and used to tape it
and just to press that in to the skin
yes I keep living in from home literally
just chit-chatting and getting ready
with you which will be why that is
yeah woohoo go further than blending out
concealer for about eight years
why am I so slow today right
John John I'm now going to go ahead and
just oh my god get this at my eye what
is it
get out I keep forgetting up what like
neighbors now so they're probably
thinking like who the hell is the girl
downstairs Rivington I'm just going to
bake and set my under eye especially
this hot weather
to make sure everything is powdered and
locked in players I think I'll just
continue with the rest of the place so
I'm going to use this and this is B
transitions formula butter bronzer I
actually got aides ago recommend me a
bronzer civil play thank you and so many
of you said this so don't be that said
this I went and got it smells really
funky I don't know like you're not it
smells like shea butter but not like
I've gone off shea butter maybe just my
brother's gone off Burt yeah I'm just
gonna I've been really liking it if
you're right it literally it blends like
butter so I'm going to just use them and
so those of you that are from the UK
like me although I've got mine from
Amazon like so then I'm going to take
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
and a little current Kim a little
contour brush I'm going to take the
middle shade here and just use that too
likely to find my cheekbones little bit
more I always like to do my bronzer and
then apply my contour if I'm using
powder just so I can further define
pretty
I think another kind of popped
collection item is be what they calling
this and I show probably just a blush
and highlighter duo and I'm going to
take the blush shade looks so pretty
that is like my color in a blush and
he's going to try that take that
those are my cheeks hmm yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah oh my god I'm I wanna feel
like blush never picks up on camera or
in pictures so it's reeling when you
want to like have a brand ask me because
you're using their blusher you hardly
see it but without applying like a
shit-ton so you don't want to do that oh
my god that brink gonna be my new
favorite blush reconsider I'm going to
see what the highlighter in this looks
light take a little bit on my Anastasia
highlighter brush hmm I thought it would
be like that it just definitely more of
a glow rather than like a pop pop so I'm
just going to actually just this like
everywhere just to give a little bit of
a glow but I'm going to give more of a
highlight highlight with the Laura gala
thing that we used earlier to apply our
time so no school to apply are in a
corner so I'm just going to take my two
t44 nook and just place that right on
the top
don't my news one guys I seriously I
can't wait to get like a sofa a TV and
all that and just get it all set up
behind your head settle in and do a flat
tool I feel like the loads of you
probably like a lot of you are going to
literally love it it's so like modern
and stuff I do want to feel like homey
so I'm like trying to make it feel homey
too at the same time I'm going to take
that single at shadow call cutouts again
and on a pencil brush just run that
along my lower lash line I'm just going
to connect it round right so once I've
done both but I'm going to take the
little the one that we used on our lid
and just paint it just like in all in a
corner on the lower lash line oh my god
I hate doing acts always get in in my
eyes and then I'm just going to apply a
bottom lash mascara and then you can do
the lip so I'm just going to go ahead
and line my lips and this is the new one
in the car
oversize hmm and it does come with
matching like liquid lipstick to this
pencil but I'm going to use a Doron
liquid look I love the color pop lip
line is they're so creamy and it blend
so nicely and so the liquid lipstick I'm
going to use is called exaggerated and
it came with the collection as well but
this MC isn't a matching one this one is
slightly larger than the oversize one I
think that it's the finished makeup look
so this is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
