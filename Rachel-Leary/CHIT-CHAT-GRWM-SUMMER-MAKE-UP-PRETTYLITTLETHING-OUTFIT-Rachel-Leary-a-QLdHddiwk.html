yes I am naked I'm just joking I'm
actually wearing a band Oh play suit
which you will see it later on in the
video because I am at so obsessed with
this outfit it's all part of the video
today we're going to be doing a summary
and get ready with me makeup and outfit
included I know you guys love it when I
do kind of like a full get ready with me
with the outfit and stuff and this
outfit is all up from pretty little
thing this video is in collaboration
with today so I thought for makeup the
outfits kind of like cute but I want the
makeup to look really just kind of like
sultry and summaries for think dark
bronze today big lashes this isn't gonna
be like your everyday summer makeup
routine this is more like going out in
the evening looking cute on the bar but
your face says so Before we jump into
the video I'm gonna give my post
notification bell shout out to Chelsea
Jane who says notifications bail on love
your video so much your fashion and
makeup it's always on point love you
love you too hopefully at this video it
doesn't disappoint either as we've got
fashion and makeup going on so without
further ado let's go ahead and jump
straight into the video I know I look
really hilarious or right now the fact
that I'm two different colors that is
about to change
let's go
so I'm just gonna put summit strobe
cream on I love this stuff for like
underneath my makeup but this is a get
ready with me I'm not gonna like talk
too much about the products that I'm
using I have left them all named and
linked down below if you're interested
on try like say as I go but that's not
the main kind of focus of this video the
main focus of this video is to chat with
you guys let's catch up what have you
all been doing have you been watching
love island I feel like we're all the
same hair so the answer is yes just
using it via benefit pearl Porefessional
primer today but um what are you guys
thinking about it the more I watch it
the more I'm thinking I do like the
people on it but just like nothing's
really happening like it's really boring
no one's got like a really strong
character no one's being you know
dramatic and causing that drama
besides hailey but she was just doing it
in like a really like nasty way I feel
like she just like wouldn't listen to
anyone or like what they had to say I
don't know maybe I should go on and
start some drama but then I was thinking
someone actually asked me that right he
went into the villa right now who would
you go for and I honestly can't tell you
none of those boys are like anything
mega obviously at first I did think Adam
he's probably you're a classic like tall
dark and handsome which I feel is what
everyone's type is is what all the girls
said that their type was and that is
also my type by the way I'm just gonna
pop the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless this is a darker shade to go
with me because I'm faked hand and
naturally fairly pale and I wasn't born
in the Caribbean which I wish I was I
know I'm gonna get so many people being
like what are you doing but I'm just
matching to my tan and it's my choice to
be this tanned so let me be okay I feel
like I'm gonna get foundation on these
hips but anyway yeah none of those boys
like my type Adam
you'd think yeah because he's tall dark
and handsome and he is like you know of
when I first looked him
did think like Sam like he's like
gorgeous but does anyone else think like
the more he sits in that little diary
room type thing and like stares into the
camera I genuinely think he looks
terrifying I he's literally like staring
you right it's like so intense and like
I don't know like yeah yeah he's like
good-looking but I don't know his face
is a bit yeah too intense for me in the
sense that like if he was looking at me
like that all of the time I wouldn't
know if he was thinking like I want to
kiss you or like I want to kill you know
what I mean but I am a bit of a sucker
for mixed-race boy so where's like I
think personality-wise he has the best
personality in there and it's like
probably one that I'd like click when
the sense that he's not too much but and
he's like so open with like his feelings
and stuff but in a way that's not too
sappy like he's still like a man if that
makes sense but he's done in touch with
her feminine side but then again I'm
lost and then oh wait the other
mixed-race boy does it Josh I think he's
good-looking as well and like he seems
like he'd be loads of fun but then I'm
also a bit of a sucker for blonde boys
and I think Charlie's quite fit too well
he's gone now sorry order that you've
not watched Friday's one but I'm sure
you guys all have yeah not sure
I think they keep putting girls in and
I'm just waiting for like perfect boy to
come in I don't think I could ever go on
a show like love island oh and like one
being like my bikini all of the time
because that's a no but - I just think I
could not be in one place trapped like
for however long they're in there for
like that is not my idea of fun
whatsoever I could go in something like
Geordie Shore because one I think my
personality would come across a lot
better and there's more chances for you
to like express yourself and you're
going out all of the time like I could
be in a situation like that but not in
like a Big Brother love Island situation
I think I'm so used to like my own
bini anyway that like I probably forget
all like I don't realize that there's
things that I do and I'm just at high on
my own like I don't know scratch my bar
more like it's my nose that I forget
people on TV would like film and see me
do but I'm just gonna do a better cream
contour I love this this is the makeup
revolution Pro HD con concealer palette
whatever I love this I've been really
reaching for this recently
not sure why so affordable as well and
it's really great gotta be looking
bronze and contoured what else I want to
talk to you both about oh yeah
oh my god over the next few weeks my
content might be a little bit
scheduled scheduled yes scheduled
because I'm going basically like on
holiday when on holiday it's a work but
like I'm going away for like three
consecutive weeks so next week I'm in
the South of France where the you tan
and town which i think is gonna be
amazing like I wasn't sure whether to
vlog it or not I wasn't I think I'm
gonna vlog when I go to LA the following
week because I think that would be so
much fun I'm going for I'm going with
Too Faced for the launch of the extended
foundation line in collaboration with
Jackie Ayanna that they worked together
on there's a big party and I think that
would just be really fun to film I'm
sure a bunch of your favorite influences
will be there the big American ones yeah
I just think that'd be more of a an
exciting vlog to watch but make sure
you're following me like on my Instagram
to keep up with my Instagram stories
because next week's gonna be insane
we're going on a yacht a yacht
in the South of France like who am i and
then the week after that I'm going to a
Marbella which I won't be vlogging
because I was allowed to bring a
plus-one and I'm bringing my best friend
Chloe and like she doesn't always like
to be on camera and like I think I'll
just be more focusing on just enjoying
myself and that kind of thing but let me
know in the comment section down below
videos that you guys would want to see
cuz I'm obviously gonna be doing a lot
of pre filming and stuff like that I do
have some ideas but I would love to know
you guys want to see I can't wait for
you to see all the like exciting content
that I'll be posting when I'm like on
those trips I think it would be epic
right so I'm gonna go ahead and power my
face and then do my brows just because
they take a while I don't want this to
like be a super super super long up
video so I'm gonna go ahead and do that
I did recently post my brow routine on
my Instagram so another reason to follow
me over there so you can go check that
out if you wanna know what I'm using but
I'll be back powdered and you know with
brows that you can see okay I am back I
am mattified and I have eye brows good
to go so I feel like what else did I
want to fill you guys in on oh my god so
you would have seen on Instagram stories
that I went to Beyonce oh my god like oh
my god it's oh definitely I feel like if
I just put black on my face folks yeah
like that was in sane she is just insane
and jay-z is just insane I forgot how
much I love jay-z actually he's so
talented the thing that like blew me
away was like the visuals they were they
like made the whole thing like you think
when you see them on a holiday and staff
or you don't even know that they're
traveling to all these incredible places
just to film like little snippets for
the visuals of their tour like so much
goes into the production of something
like that that you just have to like bow
down and I feel like real one bowing
down to the Queen and King
she is just epic the whole tour was just
epic it was just time to get Margalo on
this side my fave one of my favorite
liquid highlighters is the Anastasio at
Beverly Hills at peach Fears highlighter
like sorry again on this side whoa
so glad that wasn't on my face we want
to be a glowing to the gods today which
is why I'm gonna
be applying am i one of my favorite
highlighters at the moment it's the JLo
Inglot loose powder highlighter this on
top of a cream just pops honey it pops
thank you I just love this Cambria
right so I feel like that is my skin
makeup done classic bronzy skin by moi
so now let's zoom you in for the eyes
I'm going to be using the Urban Decay
on-the-run palette today put some a deep
bronzy goodness sorry let's just zoom
you in a little bit so you can actually
see what I'm doing I think it so another
thing that I wanted to chat to you guys
about that I saw or well you guys know
that I've been doing recently is the
keto diet now the keto diet I did
actually explain it on my Twitter but
for those of you that maybe don't follow
me on my Twitter if you don't make sure
you do the keto diet basically let me to
wait on it let me just stop in the
beginning so basically your body burns
fat and energy in two different ways one
is in the form of carbohydrates and one
is in the form of fats our body is it's
what kind of automatically program to
burn carbs as energy because they're
kind of a more efficient way of doing so
and I think it kind of I don't really
know the ins and outs of it but I just
know that our body is kind of like
naturally inclined to burn carbs before
it starts burning fats so the keto diet
is basically in a very very low or as
I'm trying to do no carb diet so what
that forces your body to do is to kind
of burn all the carbs that are in your
body apparently that it's like still
using up and then it goes into the keto
ketosis state which is where you run out
of carbs so your body is basically
forced to burn fat essentially now you
meant to eat kind of high fat foods but
like good ones is
makes sense so like high fat meats buy
fat dairies avocados that kind of thing
but this palette is nice so then your
body's just like keeps burning fat keeps
burning fat keeps burning fat and then
to see when it's run out of the food
fats that you've eaten because you don't
eat constantly
it burns body fat does that like make
sense I still don't really get how that
like like why doesn't everyone do that
is that make sense if that's the thing
but I think it's just because it's
harder than you think to eat like no
carbohydrates or just like a very low
low carbs but so far I'm finding it ok
I'm also only eating two meals a day
while trying to it's good like
intermittent fasting if you haven't
watched shayla's video on it that's like
a better explanation of how it works and
how she's getting on and stuff you guys
want me to keep you updated and posted
with how I'm getting on then I can do so
it's literally only been like a few days
so I don't feel inclined to like comment
on it too much because I haven't seen
the full of facts of it yeah I'm loving
this palette these priests kind of like
kind of like my normal vibe but I
definitely want to do something like
deep bronze and summary on the lid today
I'm feeling that accelerate color or
maybe the double life color I'm not sure
I'm feeling a dark sultry glam buff that
back in let me know if you guys have
done the keto diet before and if I've
got like any of that information wrong
that's just it very like summarized
there's loads of YouTube videos about it
like loads which should probably explain
it a lot a lot better and more
scientifically I just thought that's
kind of like me talking about it quickly
and summarizing so let's move on to the
lip color yeah I think I'm gonna go for
that
dark accelerator color dark copper smoky
vibe yeah let me know if you guys have
done the keto diet that kind of thing or
like if you think I'm just
all of my I if you think they should
just give up now because it's no good
just let me know your thoughts right I'm
gonna go ahead and do a mascara and
eyelashes and then we can be back do the
lips and then if you show you this bulge
ina office so these are the finished
eyes I went big lashes today because we
are doing a glam look these are the
Jasmine lashes from dole beauty but now
I'm gonna do a nude lip that I've been
loving at the moment it is juicy poppin
goodness so let me just love my lips
this is again the Natasha - no no lip
liner in L 6 I love this okay once we
have mimic to the appearance of lip
fillers I'm gonna go ahead and fill in
my lips with a Mac honey love lipstick
which is literally one of my all-time
favorite lipsticks oh and you can leave
it like that but I really I want to use
the buxom plumping lip polish this one
is in the color Ariana and it's this a
gorgeous like sparkly yellow and what
this is going to do is one just make my
lips up here a bit fuller because it's
got that plumping property in it and to
just add the most gorgeous golden
sparkle like oh my god if you guys don't
think that this is a mere lip then you
don't know me at all
this is like me in a lip but that is the
makeup side of this video complete I
hope you are loved it a very summery
bronzed glam I know very Mia but it is a
get ready with me and that's the kind of
thing that you know I can't get ready
for these kind of events I know you guys
too but now for the outfit part I'm
gonna actually it's always so hard for
me to like film like a full outs I'm
gonna insert a video of the outfit there
as you can see this a baby a blue play
suit is so cute so a flattering on the
figure as well and I'm obsessed with
these matching boots oh my god how cute
are they I love a statement of boot and
then perfectly ties in with the color of
the play suit then also I just paired it
with these twisted hoop earrings to add
a bit more like sass to the outfit so
it's not too too cutesy and it kind of
goes with the makeup as well I just
thought this was like a
pick some outfits for the evening like
going out for dinner drinks pub vibes or
maybe just going out in general if you
kind of like to be sassy during the day
as well you can pair with different
shoes that a little bit more casual but
I just love this whole a baby-blue fit

all from pretty little thing
