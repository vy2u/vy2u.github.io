today I decided to do a look I've kind
of seen over Instagram quite a lot
recently
is that kind of a glitter liner cut
crease and then I decided to pair it
with kind of more berry tone so on the
lips and throughout the crease and I
asked you guys kind of what videos you
want to see and loads of you said that
you wanted to see tutorial using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Mellon Modern
Renaissance palette even though I've
already done one I guessing it's just
coming around that time of year again
where the colors and stuff or maybe it's
just become a bit more accessible so
that's what I've mainly used today I'm
really and says the way that it came out
and I hope you guys like it too so if
you want to see how to get this look
then please keep watching
to pry my eyes I'm going to use this
kick-ass concealer from soap &amp;amp; Glory and
use a little powder that it comes with
to set that in place for eyes today
we're going to take the modern
renaissance palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills and this color here which
is called a burnt orange and just on a
big fluffy brush we're going to place
that into the crease because we are
going to use concealer to kind of cut
the crease out as I'll show you in a bit
it doesn't matter if you're kind of
messy with this part to further deepen
the crease we are taking this pink shade
here I think it's called love letter on
a small defined crease brush and just
buffing that into the crease to further
define it and kind of create that cut
crease look but with this step you are
going to want to go back in with color
and back in with previous brushes as
well and basically just build up the
intensity to how you want it and then
blend it out with your fluffy brushes
each time as you can see here I'm just
going back in I'm not using any darker
color it's literally the same color that
we've used before and then just kind of
keeping on applying it so I get the
intensity that I'm after and then like I
said just going back in and just keep on
a blending girl you want that crease to
a bit soft then using the same concealer
we're going to use that to cut the
crease out and basically just apply this
all over on lid where we want our lid
color to go I find it easier just on my
eyes because I don't have a really
really defined socket or like a deep
sunken suck it I have to kind of create
my own so tugging on the side of my skin
it makes it a lot easier for me and also
looking down into a mirror as well
really helps just so you can see when
you open your eyes what your crease is
actually going to look like as you can
see I'm doing there for the lid shade
we're just taking this one I couldn't
actually see the name and I can't really
remember it but it kind of looks silvery
but I think it was more like a soft pink
and we're just using that on the lid and
placing it where we placed the concealer
then going up back in with these two
pink shades just really carefully using
that to define the crease a little bit
more just so it's a really a cut and a
really sharp then once again going back
in with our fluffier brushes to make
sure there's no really really harsh
lines but I mean we still want to be
able to see the line that we created and
to make that even more clear I'm using
it this this is the Urban Decay heavy
metal glitter in the shade Midnight
Cowboy it is I think a lot of what
people use when they do this look just
because it's so easy to use like a
liquid liner to do this instead of maybe
play some like lash glue and trying to
place it glitter on it just glides
straight on and then it using the wipe
I'm just going to clean it up the edge
to create the wing but then it going in
with a small angled brush just on top of
where we place that glitter mixing at
those two darker shades together to add
a bit more depth and then once again it
back in with the fluffy brushes I think
this is my Mac two one seven but yeah
just building up and blending out to how
you want it and I'm just going to
highlight my inner corner as well with
the lightest shade from the palette just
on a small flat definer brush then we're
going to use my Maybelline master
precise liner and then it Nina
up slightly with my NYC liquid liner and
then just going ahead and applying that
mascara and lashes these are the Sascha
lashes from a hooter beauty I'm obsessed
with them then I just went ahead into my
eyebrows and now onto the skin okay
moving on to the skin for primer I'm
going to take this one from this works
and it is like a mask moisturizer and
appointment in once you want to make
sure that your skin is super clean
before you apply this I'm just going to
apply that all over my face normally I
use a brush as you guys know but this is
slightly thicker and I don't want it to
kind of like clog up my brush so I'm
just going to use kind of like
downloads' motions
so Foundation I'm getting mixing these
two together they are the objects D
sticks from Make Up For Ever one in the
shade one two seven and one in the shade
one five three one five through I think
you'd all agree would be it just too
dark me right now in tamp I'm not that
tanned and I'm just going to mix in at
this one as well
I'm mainly going to be using one two
seven and then just kind of a couple of
stripes of c15 three because it's just
the undertone of that one that matches
more two might and then I'm going to
take the kind of butt of the my Beauty
Blender and just press that into my skin
then on my forehead I only did the one
to seven shade just because with blonde
hair it can like really show it in your
hairline so I didn't kind of want that
golden color in my hairline I wanted
more of the neutral color once happy
with the coverage and stuff I'm going to
use this from LA girl it is their Pro
concealer in the shade creamy beige
which is really close to my skin color
and recently I've been really liking it
kind of using a concealer that's close
to my skin color as like a base and then
just using a bit of a guy like to
concealer to brighten up underneath my
eye on top so kind of like lots of
little layers of product and this one's
really good as well because little brush
can allow you to get really close and
really sharpen up your wing and the
coverage of it as well isn't too heavy
so I don't feel too tough on my skin
underneath my eye if I'm going to be
applying like a couple of other
concealer as well and even though this
is creamy beige I feel like there is a
slightly peachy undertone so that's
going to help kind of cancel any
darkness then taking the tapered end I'm
just going to blend everything in
and I'm going to take this contour or
cream contour palette from violet 59 and
take the lightest color here and just
place that and leave my iron kind of
everywhere where I want to bring void
and highlight its not gonna highlight
this no no and then again just going in
with that beauty blender and just
pressing it in oh then I'll tap I'd like
a fter I gives the tapered end just
between the two parts I like to use the
button of the beach blender when
blending everything in just so I feel
like that kind of merges the colors
together a bit more and then my forehead
as well at least I like to use the butt
of it just to blend it in a bit better
then you just either could cream contour
weather but I'm not going to do that
today so I'm just going to go ahead and
see everything in place with powder we
just gon be here or bokken ya know um
for bronzer I'm taking this one from a
fusion beauty it is in the shade
irradiance and it's a slightly more like
a shimmery bronzer slightly more of a
softer color which is kind of the thighs
and filling today
just dust that around the kind of like
perimeters of your face and that is what
mix the highlighted center of your face
look better or like more highlighted
okay so it's a blusher to kind of tie in
with the pink on the eyes and stuff I am
using this from L'Oreal it is their
blush sculpt in the color soft Rose soft
rosy and I'm just gonna kind of rule
like dust my brush kind of in it all and
then smile and blend lovely and for
highlighter I am going to use a liquid
highlighter first this from a sigma is
in the color afterglow and I'm just
going to dispense a little bit on the
back of my hand and then take my finger
and just kind of press it on this um
product is a slightly like iridescent
pearl finish to it so and that means
it's kind of got like pinkier undertones
I thought that would kind of tie in with
the look as oh speaking of highlight I'm
gonna go into an old favorite witches oh
no technically an eyeshadow that is
broken is the Kiko - okay I shadow just
because I saw loads of you kind of upset
over the fact I was using whisper of
guilt I know that's quite hard to get
hold of and I still really really love
that like highlighter but this one is a
really good joob and it's from Kiko and
it's an eyeshadow and it's super
affordable and you gots to get it well
we put that cream
it's lit then to finish off the eyes
going back in it to the modern or an ace
on to palette and eating that burnt
orange shade just cuz I think there's
like quite a lot going on on like top of
the eye that I just wanted something to
tie everything together but it wasn't
too it dark so I'm just gonna smoke that
along my lower lash line and then apply
it bottom lash mascara then that is the
eyes and skin finished on it to our lips
I'm going to take this lip liner from
NYX in the color bloom it is like a
gorgeous plum II pinky berry color so
really close to the crease shades and
yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and line my
lips with that I saw all over the news
how everyone was like oh and Kendall
deleted her Instagram she could get her
lips done or something somehow that was
like world wide news but I think
supposedly Kylie just over lined them I
watched a snap hair it's just further in
slightly as well and for the lips I'm
going to take this color from Too Faced
is in the shade bend and snap
and that is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this look I'm so
happy with the way that it came out and
I feel like as I kind of tried to
coordinate the lips and the kind of
crease colors together you could totally
switch this out and be really really
creative with whatever colors that you
