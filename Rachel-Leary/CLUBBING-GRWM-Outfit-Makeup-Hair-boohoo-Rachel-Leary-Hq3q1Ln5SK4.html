today is a slightly different video I
have teamed up with boo who as part of
their summer campaign to do a kind of
get ready with me type video with
obviously outfits all included and all
are from boo and will be linked in the
description down below as well as a
discount code for you guys you've never
had a boo boo before they are online
retailer even though I'm sure you guys
have already and they kind of specialize
in clothes shoes and accessories for
people around the age of my audience so
about like 16 to 25 so I'm hoping you
guys will love this video and love what
I picked also the best thing about them
is that they are super super affordable
so definitely make sure to check out the
links in the description and like I said
there is a discount code for you guys
down there as well all items were picked
by me kind of based around a theme you
guys always tell me how much you love my
kind of clubbing looks and stuff so I
wanted to do a coming get ready with me
and kind of show you the stuff that I
would wear on the night out and
obviously with makeup and hair included
as well this is a little sneak preview
of one of the outfits but if you like
the look of this makeup and hair and
obviously the outfits that you saw at
the beginning then please keep watching
so first things first I like to pick out
my outfit I'm gonna give you three
outfit options this is the first one as
this is a clubbing get ready with me you
want to make an impact and at this a
plunging jump suit is incredible you
could make it more casual with this
bomber jacket or dress it up with this a
blazer cape and obviously a pair of
black heels to go with it the next one
is this bodysuit and skirt I'm obsessed
with this combination it is a twisted
hold snake bodysuit and this skirt
really clings in all the place that you
want it to so perfect for a night out
and you could even dress it up with this
duster coat but this was my favorite
this blush skirt and white bodysuit as
well and I'm obsessed obviously like I
said with the Black Hills all items will
be listed at down below and next up is
makeup so as I picked the blush skirt
and the cream bodysuit we're going to
match it to that so I'm going in with my
eye shadow a primer potion from Urban
Decay and just blending that all over my
lid to make sure our eye makeup lasts a
lot longer and everything that blends
lot smoother on the lid and I do like to
set that in that place with the powder
and this is just my Mac Studio Fix
powder
next I'm going in with the modern
renaissance palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills and taking the color fern
orange and just blending that into my
crease as always as this is a clubbing
get ready with me I'm kind of going with
looks that I love and I'm comfortable
with if you guys think this is quite
similar to a lot of the other stuff I do
you are kind of right just because that
is the kind of looks that I feel safe
with but then I'm going in with these
two shades and just mix them together on
a slightly more defined crease brush and
just using that like I said to further
define my crease and create that
gradient effect you guys know I love
then just softening the edges between
those two by going back in with the
original fluffy brush that we use not
with any excess product just using the
brush to blend them both together from
the same palette I'm it taking it this
shade here and just using that same
brush to a further deepen and define the
socket and kind of create that gradient
effect again
for the lid shade I wanted something a
pink to tie it in with the outfit so
this is the NYX prismatic eyeshadow in a
Girl Talk and I'm just pressing that on
to the lid not kind of really creating a
cut crease but I am taking all the way
up to my crease just to define it a
little bit but yeah like I said it's not
a cut crease look but you can obviously
do whatever you want
then I'm going back in with this shade
here and just diffusing the crease
colors with that eye shadow that we've
just placed on our lid
I didn't want it to be too harsh at the
darkest color I'm going to use it's just
this dark brown here and then on a
really small definer fluffy crease brush
just using that on the edges of the eye
shadows it's just concentrating this on
the outer portion of the eye just to
create that final gradient and just
deepen it slightly my favorite part the
part where all looks normal I'm taking a
wipe and just creating it that wing and
cleaning up any fallout or mess that we
had underneath our eyes the highlight my
inner corner I'm at taking this shade
right here and yeah like I said just
highlighting my inner corner with a
pencil brush and then just taking up
slightly underneath my brow bone now for
eyeliner I'm taking the Maybelline
master precise liner and I know my hands
are a very dark you don't need to tell
me it was a bad time okay so we'll just
move past it yeah as you can see I'm
just taking it the liner across my lid
first and creating the kind of thickness
that I want this is just the method that
I prefer to do and you guys always want
me to include eyeliner so this is a
struggle because it actually is really
hard to film but yet I do the thickness
across my lid first and then the wing
and I use the wiped away eye shadow kind
of base line as my base so I can get the
angle that I want and then I drag it
back in towards the lid liner that we've
already done that this is the method
that I find the most effective because
then it's kind of quite hard for it not
to be even yeah once you've connected it
all together you can then build up any
more thickness or tidy up as much as you
need to
once I was happy with my liner I just
applied mascara and lashes these other
lashes at girl you crazy and I do have a
discount code below as well and this is
what the eyes look like with the lashes
on
but now on eyebrows you guys know these
are the products I've been loving at the
moment and I do want to do an updated
brow routine but I will just kind of
whisk through this quickly I like to
take the anastasia dipbrow in a medium
brown towards the end of my brows
because that's what I'm the most sparse
and I kind of need them more kind of
concentrated thicker products and I can
definitely build up my brows with this
product which is why I'm obsessed with
it and I love it so much yeah as you can
see I concentrate this towards the end
and start kind of halfway across and
then do it the tail and I use a I think
this is a sigma eyeliner brush to do
this again um I always link them down
below once I'm happy with that I take
the benefit browsing powder and I and an
angled brush and I take this through the
front just because I think a powder
finish is a lot more natural and I don't
want the product to be so heavy towards
the front of my brows I want it to be
more of a gradient so I always twist and
turn my brush in upwards motions to
mimic hairs as well then once I'm happy
with this shape I take the benefit 3d
brow tones I think this was in the shade
too just to lighten up my brow slightly
and give it more of a hairy effect if
that makes sense
and these aren't my finished brows but
yeah like I said I will do a brow
tutorial soon now onto the skin I'm
priming my skin using my NYX angel Belle
primer and buffing that in using my Real
Techniques expert face brush I think
that's what this called or is it the
multitask brush I think it might be the
multitask brush I just always prefer to
blend my skincare in with a brush under
foundation I'm taking the Maybelline
matte and poreless one just because I
want my skin to stay matte throughout
the night and this one is my favorite at
the moment as it has a really good
coverage as well and just buffing that
into my skin using my Sigma flat top
kabuki brush and yeah just blending away
and buffing away I always find a buffing
and pressing foundation into your skin
gives you maximum coverage and always
seems to last longest on me then I'm
taking this new product it's from a nude
Stix and it's the concealer stick in the
shade light 3 I think and I loved this
it really allowed me to kind of like
sharpen up the edges of my liner because
it was
pencil and it had a really decent
coverage as well so I'm really loving
these at the moment yeah and then I'm
just blending that all in it with a damp
Beauty Blender because it is quite thick
I always tend to use a damp Beauty
blender to blend it all out just because
it absorbs any excess product and allows
everything to kind of blend into my skin
perfectly
on a night out I always prefer a cream
contour so I'm using the la girl Pro
concealer in the shade beautiful bronze
just kind of placing it all the places
that I want to warm up and define a bit
more so it tends to be on my cheekbones
along my jawline and the tops of my
forehead as well and I did apply a
little bit too much so I did go in with
my Beauty Blender to blend it all out
don't you worry
you guys are obsessed with this powder
if you want to look naturally airbrush
you need to put this in your shopping
basket right this second this is the RT
ma no color powder and I just use this
underneath my eyes and all over my face
particularly concentrating it in the
place that I know I get kind of hot the
most so I avoid sweating and my makeup
coming off on a night out so I know that
can always be an issue for people yet
just dusting this everywhere and as you
can see it literally just airbrushes
your skin I'm obsessed with this product
then taking the bronze up from this
Nicks I think it's a contour and
highlighting a duo I will have listed it
down below and just using that to kind
of set the cream contour that we used
earlier
the blusher I'm using this one from the
Naza is sex appeal and just yet using a
blusher brush to apply that to the
apples of my cheeks it was one of the
palest blushes that I owned and I was
feeling a really pastel pink look as
you'll see with the eyes cheap and the
lips as well so I wanted to keep the
theme and then for highlighter I'm using
Mac oh darling and I know this was
limited edition so I have linked
alternatives down below don't you were
there so many dupes out there for this
one I just felt like using it this one
today because I hadn't in a really long
time
back onto the eyes I'm at taking it this
eyeshadow here and just buffing that
along my lower lash line with a pencil
brush and then on a flat definer brush
I'm mixing it these two shades together
and just pressing that up against my
lashline to define it a bit more and
then buffing it back out with the pencil
brush again then I just applied at
bottom lash mascara and these are the
finished eyes onto lips I'm taking a mac
subculture pencil and just using this to
line my lips and I do personally like to
over line mine slightly but obviously
it's up to you but yeah just using this
to line my lips and color them in
slightly and then for the lip color I
went for something like I said along the
pastel pink theme it's like this is a
milkshake from Anastasia Beverly Hills
and you guys are probably say that it's
super pale and I was aware so I do go
back in with the pencil to blend it in
and make it a bit less bright as you'll
soon see
then for a bit of gloss this is the
Natasha Turner lip glaze in the color 20
sandy beige I think I will have listed
it down below but that is the finished
makeup look besides me just quickly
highlighting my Cupid's bow as always
yeah this is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys love it something a
bit Pinker for me but now on to the hair
I'm it taking my Bellamy Hot Tools 6 and
1 and this is the 25 millimeter to 18
millimeter wand something a bit thinner
for me because normally I find when I
use the thicker one sometimes my curls
drop a bit so I wanted to try something
a bit different so I'm taking a slightly
thinner one so the curls would be
slightly more tight if that makes sense
but still using the same motion as
always using it in an outwards motion
away just because I think that's a bit
more flattering for me I prefer my curls
to curl outwards away but yeah just
doing it layer by there taking up medium
bits and like I said just holding in for
about 15 seconds each and yeah I've done
this many times before so I didn't
include my forehead because that would
have taken way too long but as you can
see it's slightly more concentrated
curls and I'm just repeating the process
until I get the very very top and then
we have to finish hair look as well
so this is the finished hair and makeup
complete now all that stuff to do is get
changed into your favorite outfit so
this is the finished hair and makeup
look with that outfit on I'll insert a
picture here if you can't remember what
this outfit was at the beginning of the
video this person he was just my
favorite just because I think the white
and the blush color the skirt pretty
tired of me the makeup but I'm literally
in love with all the items so any doubts
I tried on I would probably would have
worn on and night out for all the items
