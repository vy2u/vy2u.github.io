today I am doing a bit of a collective
hauls this has kind of been stuff I've
accumulated over like the past month or
so just this month I kind of bought a
lot of stuff and some stuff was kind of
gifted to me so I thought I would share
it's kind of mix of makeup nails and a
couple of accessories so I think I have
the most makeup stuff so I'm going to
jump in and start with that so starting
off with the face I've recently got the
makeup Ever Ultra HD foundation and I've
got a lot of questions asking where I
got it from because sometimes makeup for
other stuff can be quite hard to get
hold of in the UK and I got this from
guru makeup Emporium which they have a
shop in Kensington but they do also have
an online shop as well which is where I
got this from and I got up in the shade
1 to 7 which is the shade that I have it
in the normal HD foundation and yet this
is a really good much me that's what I
have on today if you like the look of my
skin and yeah I'm really liking it so
far I apply it with a damp Beauty
Blender but also used the tongue for
Korean foundation brush that I used
before and it works just as nicely so
I've been really liking it this next I
kind of jumped on to the bandwagon with
this one I got the Laura Mercier setting
powder in translucent just because I've
seen all like the makeup artists on
Instagram using this and raises as
they're so watch don't have snapchat
pictures Jesse and all of them use this
too and it is just as good as they say
it just makes your makeup look like
airbrushed they there's the technique
you know when it's like speaking and I
tried doing that and that I've never
tried that technique before and it's
actually interesting you can almost feel
the setting powder like absorb your
concealers then when you brush it away
you are literally left with the most
airbrushed looking skin but also I was
watching makeup geeks video when she was
talking about when she went to my
you know makeup i Mario's makeup cinema
senemo I think that's the word and he
was saying apparently one of his tips
was to apply the powder on a damp Beauty
Blender and kind of press it into the
skin so I did that today and I really
liked how that worked so I've been
really liking how this product makes my
skin look I also picked up another
foundation I've used to move that's why
they've all got marks in but it's
basically the antipope it's from the
brand called Maren and it's their celeb
pro HD foundation I got the shade
eurasia japonaise I think and this is
the one that I got for my face I then
also got the shade medium one and then
PVC which is like a bit of a deeper
brown shade which I got look like a
cream contour shade and then I also got
the shade light for and I've got that as
like a concealer highlighting shade
they're actually really cheap I saw this
is the one that and like Kylie Jenner's
makeup artist president said this is the
one that she used and I was actually
surprised when I search for it online it
was all eight pounds or one of them so I
thought I'd get three in each different
color if you don't like full coverage
foundation don't get this it's so thick
you can kind of see that it's literally
like a cream like if you wear the mac
studio finish concealer is literally
like a bit of a creamier version of that
it's so trick on your facebook I like I
did the Make Up For Ever foundation use
a dump you to going to blend out to kind
of share out the coverage and that's the
only way I can apply it otherwise I
literally feel like I'm taking it but it
does give you a flawless finish so I
understand why they use this makeup
because I'm pretty sure this is if
there's a stage makeup so it's meant to
withstand light and it's meant to look
good in photography so if you take a lot
of pictures and makeup and say I would
recommend
this foundation another face product I
got finally is the laura geller
highlighter in gilded honey I still kept
a box of this once I got it quite
recently it looks like there it is
bu on the cheeks it just looks so
highlighted I think the next makeup
video I'm going to do it's like the
bronze kind of goddess makeup tutorial
because I got a few products recently
that make your skin just look so
flawless and glowing and coming to the
end of summer I just want to make the
most of it before or like the autumn
tutorials start coming out but yet I've
recently picked this up from cult Beauty
they've recently started stuffing this
so now I think are you personally I
thought it was just going to be it in
America or like something like that I'd
have to order it from that cult Beauty
just started stocking laura geller and
if this sold out like pretty much
instantly so I have to sign up to be
notified when it came back in so I got
female it was straight in my car to buy
but yeah so that's the fieldid honey
it's a dupe filling Mac whisper of guilt
and the Kiko eyeshadow in Tori I think
it's really similar to that so the final
skin product I got was from Charlotte
Tilbury and I'd never bought anything
from Charlotte to a bit before but I'd
heard such good stuff but this and I've
seen makeup makeup by Mary rave about
this as well it's the super model body
basically it looks like little minds a
bit dirty like this and you basically
roll it onto the skin and it's just
something that basically affects the
appearance of your skin it makes you
look so Julie so bronzy so that's also
another reason why I want to do that
tutorial because I would use this - it's
just like Robert or like your chest or
your arms or something like before
you're going out and it just gives you
that gorgeous like bronze scale like
you've just been on holiday so I've
really liked that I have a few other
products that do similar things this but
this one I think it's got the most
natural color in it as well so it's
definitely recommend this one
now onto lip
I've got a few lip products get my mom
so I'll start with this I got this from
cult beauty as well it's from the brand
called nude sticks I think they stuck it
in the space and K as well but basically
I had about this band through Samantha
so one of the bus wash girls and it's in
the shade whisper to them you can see
our swatch so it's basically just like
that perfect nude shade and they say lip
and cheek vents but I only plan to put
this on my lips but I really like pencil
lip products I've really creamy as well
like this is almost like and lipstick
just in a pencil just cuz I find them a
lot easier to carry around of you and
just really easier like application as
well so I think nothing wrong I think
the contenders really tuned like that so
I get also from Cole Beauty I got to OCC
lip tars one is more it's a stained
gloss in the shade naeun hair it's Mei
NH e double ah I'm not just swatch that
one as well all if these are nude shades
by the way I kind of went on a bear the
nude shop but it's basically just like
not clear gloss it's got a tint to it
but it's kind of a pinky gold tin and I
already like it's a pale pink he built
it and I really like just applying that
on the top or like just in the center
just like to make my lips look a bit
bigger so they've got that one and in
the shade of Hollywood as well and this
one is a little it's a bit more
pigmented and it's got like an
iridescent gold finish just that one at
the bottom so it's like a pale pink
shade but it's got that gold finish to
it which I find when it catches the
light makes your lips it really plump
and that's always what I want my lips to
look like next I got two things from Tom
Ford I got the shade
naked in their lip gloss which you can
see there this is the shade lip gloss
that I wore to my prom so the pictures
that you saw my Instagram of my prom and
stuff like
this was the lipgloss I wore then but I
I've used and this lipgloss then and
this I just wanted to get my own one so
that's that once you know what that one
looks like and then I got the lipstick
in the shade there just at the bottom so
again a really wearable nude shade I've
no actually owned anything tumbled so I
thought why not be the first two things
I get be it too nude lip product and the
final two lip products I got a boat from
makeup forever this is the lip pencil in
the shade 1c so again just like a really
easy everyday lip liner shade I really
like the formula of these they're really
creamy and really easy to apply like
some I find Columbus not necessarily
break away on your lips but take a lot
more effort when applying it or is this
one just glides on really easy so I
really like that one and this is the
artist plexi gloss in the shade 100 P
and it looks like this now I'm kind of a
disappointing this so I thought it was
gonna be quite pigmented I thought it
was going to be like a pigmented nude
shade like this but it is basically I
can just watch just we're just at the
top there it's pretty much just a tiny
tint of pink and just glitter basically
but I'm quite I'm a fan of glitter on
the lips
I didn't mind I just thought it was
gonna be a bit more pigmented than that
so I'd only ever wear this on top of
something I didn't really want to change
the color of but just maybe wanted to
change the finish on my lips so that's
that one that's all the makeup I got so
now under nails nails is probably a
question that you guys ask me a lot
about in the comments just when you see
glimpse of them at the moment I'm
wearing Mac delicates
on my nails but if any of you asked but
I don't actually own that one
just used it in the store but recently I
picked up a few nail varnishes so a lot
of one that's really similar to Mac
delicates is se mismatched which a lot
of you guys are seeing about when I post
it on my snapchat which is Rachael Erie
if you're interested yeah it's basically
one of those ones that's not a very
straight color like if you want a solid
color from it you have to give it a few
coats and but I really like the event to
this that you can almost kind of see you
know underneath there so it's that kind
of French Mike your look so really like
that one eye open I also got the Essie
gel color in the shade
Riviera chic and I can't actually paint
my own nails with this one at home I'd
have to go to the salon and get it done
just because with gels you need an LED
light to get the finish that you want or
I think I actually did try and pick my
nose at this and it just took so long to
dry it and then get ever did dry so I
just wiped off I just thought next time
I go in I'm gonna take this with me and
get them to do this so I'll keep you
updated and post a picture of my nails
when I use this one but guys it sounds
like I'm obsessed I kind of am but this
is one that Kylie Jenner used and then
the next two I bought are from OPI and
they look really similar but I was just
stalking the Instagram page I think it's
high on lacquer or something it's the
one that the nail the nail Beauty bar
place that like all the big Instagram
people and celebrities go to like
sometimes this high and lacquer page
does the nails that are on that page one
thing and she kept using these two
shades and they looked so nice this one
was the most one night of the she used
and it's OPI don't bother me don't
bother Nover me around so it's kind of
like a really muted móvil base shade
kind of a hint of
Linna my thinking in a why there's a lot
during the port and try and just because
a bit more cooler toned so all obviously
post pictures when I wear this line this
one's a bit really similar like
undertone but this one's just slightly
more pink than past all and this one is
my very first knockwurst
my very first knockwurst looks like that
I don't see must I might do like a nail
polish collection if so I must have like
800 shades of nude nail varnish but
they're all different for me obviously
that's kind of all like the makeup stuff
that I got next thing I've got was I got
some rings from forever 21 and this kind
of like arrow shade shade shape that was
a big one here but I tried it on and I
get everywhere
mmm but yeah someone's like this there's
really inexpensive and I really like the
arrows I think it's just because I feel
like it makes my fingernails like a bit
longer and I have really short stubby
fingers so anything that's gonna make my
nails look longer I and downfall finally
the next thing I got was this watch from
Daniel Wellington I'm absolutely
obsessed with it it's so simple and so
plain I think this one was cold there I
can't remember the exact name of it but
it's basically a black leather strap and
the details are rose gold really simple
I when it comes to accessories I'm so
simple with stuff like this so this is
perfect and I never normally wear work
just said this one is like perfect for
me and you guys can get 15% off with the
code leery until September 15 if you
guys also want to tailor these watches
which I really recommend you do they're
so comfortable so easy to wear and if
you're like me and you don't really like
a massive blingy watch or just anything
that's really like out there I feel this
is like
the perfect so that is everything for my
whole guys I hope you enjoyed it let me
know if you like seeing these kind of
things it gives me an excuse to buy a
bit more and show you kind of the stuff
that I'm interested in I might start
doing favourites videos just because I
go look I got a little stuff I bought a
little stuff and I want to share with
you guys the kind of stuff and
personally brilliant like you give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
leave in the comments but I think that
you want to see next I have a few videos
lined up and I'm gonna stop doing now I
finish pretty little liars that stop
taking over my life I am going to stick
