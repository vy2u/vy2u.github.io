Howard Lothrop orchards in my head guy
up again
and I am
and yes
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
good hey guys welcome back to my channel
so you can janitor everyday look for me
today just kidding I wanted to have a
play around with some color I know I
love you guys that love it when I use
color and a lot of you've been asking me
to miss you a full face using a high-end
makeup so all of the stuff I'm using is
like in the high-end category I would
say and some of them are like pizza I'm
so glad that I had a rummage and that I
had because I miss using them and it
always fun it says mix it up because
some people really love to spend money
on their makeup so this is if you're
into color and you like to spend and
this tutorial is what you're going to be
for you you look totally I mix it up
I've done more like a halo eye and after
matching halo lips so I really hope you
guys like this and I'll see you could
recreate this or kind of use the same
techniques and use two different colors
yeah I really hope you guys like the
kind of diversity of this video and if
you'd like to look at this makeup look
or just want to know what kind of
products I'm using then please keep
watching
okay so I'm going to start with my will
kind of half of my skin at first because
I want to do like a halo I type lips so
I find that more comfortable to just do
that after I've done my foundation so to
begin I if you sort of snapshot I was
really excited to try this this is the
muck prep and prime essential oils but
it's in like a sit form and you guys
know I said I've been really loving
wearing an oil and meet my makeup and
this just kind of gives you a really
nice amount of oil without like dripping
too much on your face so different you
might be really good if you've wanted to
try that kind of look at it is really
good for your skin applying oils if you
have oily skin because this one doesn't
kind of like I said applied too much so
I think it's really good so I just do
like a few strokes and then I'm just
going to kind of use a sponge to like
disperse that all over my skin and like
press it into my skin so primer I'm
going to take the new at nas radiance
primer I think I saw that they've come
out with three versions of this primer
and this one is obviously the radiance
one and have a slightly pink undertone
to help brighten up the skin and it's
super hydrating as well I've been in the
market for new primer cos I feel like
I've always or like I am always using
the same one I do want to mix it up for
you guys maybe like skin cap makes such
a difference in your makeup and the way
that it looks eyes don't mind investing
a little bit so there's any like
high-end or like other high-end
apartments that you want to try or like
want to know how they work let me know
and I will try or let me know what your
favorites are can see my skin is looking
like super do you first ochre on the
foundation I'm going to take the Tom
Ford at Tracy's foundation now I
recently used the Tom Ford truck I
recently used the term for more
traceless foundation stick in a tutorial
I do also have the liquid one as well so
I'm going to use this and this is in the
shade natural I can't actually remember
the coverage of this so I just kind of
dug digital and it's sponge that into
the skin I'm so glad you guys like
remind me to do these types of Tudor
feels like because because I forget half
the stuff I've got it so bad and like I
had this foundation two ages and I like
never use it and that's because it's
like such an expensive foundation so I
like to treasure it but the whole
traceless foundation mic range that Tom
Ford does is so pretty like this kick is
really good as well I feel like it's so
buildable and customizable come forward
when I worked at Mac was like one of the
it was like one of my favorite parts was
the fact that I've got discount to come
focus their makeup is so nice like their
bronzes which we've got here today but
they have like I shouldn't cause as well
but I know I love like celebrity makeup
artist the shimmers and like stunning
and then lip gloss is a and lipsticks of
beaut okay for concealer I'm going to
take the NARS
complete denars the soft matte complete
cover concealer oh my god I saw Jackie I
and I rave about this I think and I like
trust everything that she said she's
like it's the best full coverage
concealer on the market right now I've
seen so many other like bloggers and
stuff rain about it when I tried it I
was had like really really high hopes
you know sometimes need really high
notes or something you're like please
please please
don't let me down or like don't let me
be that one person that doesn't love it
okay I loved it what loved it so I'm
super excited to try it honestly so soft
like the fact that it's called that it
makes so much sense and I'm in the shade
canal in this but is it canal canal
something like that I'm just going to
take a bit on my brush and apply it
underneath my eyes and everywhere that I
want to brighten up I always like to
pick up the sides of my nose as well and
I put a bit on my eyes underneath that
this is like my primer and we got and
then I'm just going to take my sponge
and blend that all in I always find with
slightly stick concealers but they look
so much better and they don't take as
much if you blend them in with a sponge
so you've found that you're just getting
really cakey but you're just using like
a brush to blend it in that might be why
because I feel like brushes just press
it into the skin and a sponge kind of
absorbs it slightly so it's not
buying too much or letting it sit too
thick on the skin so I thought like I
find it works a lot better can you like
see it honestly looks airbrushed if I do
through some witch so now I am going to
bake underneath my eyes using the Elora
Mercier translucent setting powder and
I'm going to leave the powder there and
then go ahead and do my eye like do my
eyes because I don't know if anything's
going to fall out and I got a little
play around with some glitters and stuff
so I want to be able to wipe that way so
I just like to dispense it like in at my
little pot and then just really press
that into the skin and I just like to
lightly dust it to mattify the rest of
my face so I'm going to pause there for
the skin and I'm going to go ahead and
do like one eye because I haven't got it
deal but I kind of have an idea what I
want to do so I make sure they get it
just right so I will be back to show you
how I'm using on my brows and after do
what I do so I'm going to go ahead and
do it my eyebrows and to begin I'm going
to take two products and if I'm going to
use the anastasia beverly hills dipbrow
in soft brown and then i'm going to use
it the hourglass sculpting a brow pencil
like the front of my brow for a more
extended effect so I always like to
raise my brow and I do this I'm always
actually like so messy when it comes to
doing my brows and then I just clean up
with concealer and that's all good as
new like the Taylor my brows never that
sick it's just going to have to be
cleaned up but yeah then like I said I'm
going to take the hourglass sculpt brow
pencil just through the front of my brow
and this was in the shade like ash brown
I think I could hit the flat side to
kind of run it right along the bottom
and then use the sides just to sew that
up and then I'm going to take this
bootie that comes with and just brush it
all through and then like I said I'm
going to go in with the NARS concealer
and just sculpt out my over
just underneath and then I'm just gonna
bust that down now we're ready to start
the eyeshadow I don't really have when I
wasn't in my collection I noticed I've
even had that many high-end eyeshadows
like a lot of the ones I've got a really
affordable but I thought I would use I
thought I would use this old beauty
today this is the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette I'm just going to take the shade
limit as our initial transition color
you can take a big fluffy brush and just
buff that back and forth all across my
lid really nice movie palette so is
ideal for slightly more clear based or
I'm probably haven't used it in a while
then I'm going to take the artist
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills
which was the only like high-end palette
I found that actually has color in it
and then I'm going to take this shade
here and this is when I start to kind of
create the halo effect I'm going to
concentrate that on the outer part i
picking it quite far across and then
again on the inner part i don't worry
you haven't left like a space initially
because the shape i'm going to be
placing in the middle that you can see
is quite bright so it will clear it
always like kind of clear its own space
and then I'm just going it back in with
the initial brush and just soften out
the edges in the crease and then it's a
further deepen and then from the same
palette to further deepen I'm going to
take this shade here which is called
aubergine which is a brilliant gorgeous
dark purple color I'm taking like a
small flat shader brush I'm just going
to really press that into the outer
corner still making sure you can see the
purple that you just place down and then
in the inner corner as well then I'm
going to pick up a tiny bit more of that
bright purple shade and just use that to
help blend it together on the lid and
then go back in with the fluffy
the original fluffy brush to blend out
blend it out on the crease again now for
the nude color I am gonna use the I'm
going to use the Anastasia Beverly Hills
glow kit and I'm going to take this
shade here which is called a sassy grape
I literally haven't used this I'm going
to use that as a highlighter as well but
either G for this panel but oh my god
such a pretty color I'm not used in ages
I'm just going to then press this onto
the middle and just like let it diffuses
so I'll I want that color to be quite
strong so I'm going to leave it like
that and then what is a halo eye without
a little bit of glitter so I'm going to
take the makeup forever diamond powder
and this is in the shade of five I think
I've definitely done it listed the name
of it down a below because it's a really
complicated rule focus it's a really
complicated name I think so yeah I've
left the name of it down below but it's
a gorgeous like iridescent pink so I'm
just taking a bit of glitter glue and
placing that on top of the obviously the
lid color that was just for the middle
of the lid colors that we've just put
down and then pick up a little bit
because it would be too overwhelming of
that diamond powder and just press it on
top I'm just going to go back in with
that aubergine shade and like just
reinforce like the darkness just like
that and then I think that's kind of the
top two eyes finished from and that same
highlighting palette though I'm going to
take the marshmallow shade which is the
iridescent yellow leads Goldy color and
you're going to use that to highlight my
inner corner I'm actually on my brow
bone as well
then I'm going to take one of the more
colorful at Marc Jacobs eyeliners I've
been loving deeds at the moment this one
is in the shade missed me and I'm going
to run that along my waterline then
because I'm not applying anything else
more to the top of our on top of our
lives I can brush this away now do that
it was very much
outfit words it was alright and then I'm
essentially just going to repeat the
process I did on the top on the bottom
so I'm going to take that fuchsia shade
and just concentrate it on the outer
plot and be in the part and then I'm
also going to go back in with that
aubergine color again and just
concentrate it on the very very outer
part I'm in the very very inner plot and
then reapply that fluffy grape shade
from the Anastasia highlighting palette
then I'm actually going to apply the
glitter again as well crystal that'd be
cool so that is the shadow complete I'm
now going to go ahead and apply a little
bit of mascara and for that I'm using
the Mac Court and naughty mascara so
you've never tried to subscribe before
it's actually like a two-in-one
one we used to call this their like day
and night mascara on the top you have
like a really light fluffy brush and
then if you put it down again this one
opens up as well and it's a lot thicker
and it gives you a lot more volume and
length
I'm leaves a slightly thicker brush I am
going to be applying lashes but I'm just
using this to coat and then I'm going to
use the like light and fluttery wand to
do my bottom lashes like I said I'm
going to go ahead and apply eyelashes
and I'll try to think like high-end
eyelashes like gasps they're probably
going to be more the expensive ones and
the slightly more expensive ones are the
like faux mink or mink lashes so I'm
going to take these ones from Avila I
thought the packaging goes my only
makeups na as well and these ones are
really wait they're in the style of
flash it and they're super wispy and
rounded so I'm just going to go ahead
and apply those and I'll be right back
they are the perfect ones for this look
I think they're nothing too dramatic
they're super wispy and fluttery and be
able to actually pop they're clear band
collection so perfect this looks without
doing any eyeliner because sometimes
with these lashes they have like a very
thick black band and it can be so hard
to banana so these ones already flexible
too okay moving back onto the skin for
my bronzer today I'm going to take the
atomic force bronzer in a gold dust and
just use this to warm up my complexion
forgot how nice this bronzer is I think
I saw makeup by Mario using this when
someone runs and that's why it went on
and guard it you know just so many
things I'm just like makeup my marrying
did it so therefore I must I'm never
going to go ahead and contour slightly
and for that I'm going to use the Mac
sculpting a powder in the shade sculpt
on a little brush and in places just
underneath where I put the bronzer this
is a slightly cooler point or color and
I'm pretty sure they do it permanently
now but at the time they didn't so it
was part of like Maleficent collection
and I am going to use this shade to just
contour my nose slightly as well then I
always just like to dab it in with a
sponge okay so the blush I wanted to
kind of tie it in with the pinky
perfectly it seemed only one anything
too pink or like orange II so I'm it
taking a dis blusher from Marc Jacobs
and it's in the color lush and it
was limbo Russian libido and gold and
I'm just going to swirl my brush my
blusher blush in both colors and then
with my highlight again I'm going to
take the Anastasia Beverly Hills bloke
it but you off the sweets one and take
the shade fluffy grades again which is
one that we use on our eyes it was a
super rushed and more for you to I
actually forget how much I like using
kind of slightly colored highlighters
and you can be really pretty and like
really complement and look specially I
did was like I'm using the same color I
do that a lot I like to apply
highlighters as lid colors and then like
like make each other pump and then it's
a lips I'm going to take two perks from
Urban Decay
this is their advice this is their vice
lipstick in the shade and ammonia notes
by their mush aids
this looks really silly right now
because I tell you what see the gap but
I'm now going to go in with the advice
liquid lipstick and this one it's in the
shade ZZ and I'm just going to apply
that in the middle and I actually kind
of want to be a little bit lighter in
the middle a bit to like say me for me
they look totally it's like they're
going to be drastically different in the
packets but I in their packaging so I'm
going to go into that highlighter
there's a C great one and just dab that
in the middle on top and then I am now
going to use the color effects
illuminating a setting spray which
literally I think only came out
yesterday so this is the finished makeup
look I really hope you guys like it I'm
literally just playing with color and
experimenting quite different looks for
me as I'm sure you'll agree by really
devices like these are products me
playing around with some more high-end
bit so make sure you this video a thumbs
