hey guys welcome back to my channel as I
say I'm kind of doing a festival look is
kind of submiss my last one bit I kind
of mix up the colors I did a bit more
bolder there's a winged liner going on
Decimus seriously big accessory is going
on as well but I want to use
complementary colors you can feel free
to mix it up and be inspired by this as
much as you want for a door a take away
as much as you want from this season it
relies on my favorite colors to pair
together pink and green is like red and
green are complementary colors so they
are kind of meant to go so really hope
you guys enjoy this look I have left the
links to everything down below including
all the jewelry and everything like that
but yeah without further ado if you want
to know how to get this colorful at glam
festival tropical inspired makeup look
then please keep watching
I'm going to start off by priming my
eyes using my Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in the shade light warm I
always love to use my concealer
sometimes of my eye primer and then
always set it in place just with a loose
powder to start off with I'm going to
take the dare to bare eye shadow palette
from model's own and take this warm
brown shade here this is such a good
palette for transition colors it's
literally all map neutrals so a perfect
kind of everyday or whatever you want to
use it for but I'm just taking this
shade here as our initial transition
color as it's a really gorgeous warm up
Brown for the rest of the eyes I'm going
to take me Lancome Venus palette and
take this hot pink shade here are they
big fluffy brush and buff this all
across my lid I am going to be using my
concealer later to carve out my crease
so it doesn't matter how messy we are
and I feel like with it I feel like with
the festival looks the Messier and
grungy the better and then a further did
not miss crews with this a dark burgundy
color here you can see how pigmented
these shadows are they are absolutely as
stunning and I'm just going to buff that
back in froth into my crease and then
like I said it's my dream it transitions
onto the lid because we are going to be
cleaning it up afterwards I'm going to
take a big fluffy brush the one that we
used earlier and just blend that out so
here I am at taking a concealer and I'm
going to use that to carve out the
crease kind of creating that half cut
crease look this is perfect if you have
slightly hooded eyes because you can
create your own crease I think I said
that before but it's a really good trick
for that but I am just kind of using
this to tidy up the lid make it nice and
clean so then when we place the shadow
colors down it they are going to be a
super super pigmented and not lost
against the pigmentation of the crease
shadows so I'm going to go ahead and
take this shade here from the same at
vena's palette and just place this on
the inner most part of my eye I'm going
to leave the middle part blank cause I'm
going to place a different color there
but just kind of placing this on the
inner and then taking it a little bit
across there's a pigment is from neve
cosmetics it is in the same shade
compilation i think is the most gorgeous
like chrome rust-red shade I'm literally
obsessed that look at it I'm I love that
color and you're going to go ahead and
above this dark brown shade into the
crease and this is just going to create
that smoky effect and we're going to use
this to define the crease a bit more
also make it super sultry super smoky
going back in with the other brushes and
just buffing everything
out then I'm going to take this island
girl glitter from lit cosmetics and take
a little liner brush and take the lip
glitter glue I'm going to use this and
kind of place that on the crease first
and then take a clean liner brush and
take the island girl glitter and place
that directly on top this glitter has
three flex of green and pink in it so
perfect in this look because now we're
going to go in with the NYX miss I can't
even talk the next prismatic eyeshadow I
think this is in the color of venom and
just place that on the inner most part I
to brighten up the inner corner then I'm
going to tidy everything up underneath
and create a winged out effect and give
us a really handy base when we do our
winged eyeliner and I'm going to be
mixing it to and creating like a
gradient wing and they're both via vivid
bright eyeliners from NYX going to take
the light green one at first I've left
the names of them down below I'm going
to place this on the inner most part and
take it halfway across the lid and then
I'm going to take V a dark green shade
and basically it's do that with the wing
but then it blend it together in the
middle and then I will go back in and
blend it slightly but if you want it to
be more like a harsh gradient you could
just leave it like that I'm just using
this to fill in the wing and then I'm
going to take a little bit of the wipe
and just tidy all up so it's all super
sharp and it's super neat but like I
said I'm going to go back in with the
green and I've wiped majority of the
product off so then when I'm placing it
down it's barely placing any and it just
creates a really soft gradient the
lashes I'm going to take the slay lashes
in collaboration with my girl Shelby and
then I'm going to use the brow girl
clear brow set to create more of a
fluffy Brown sect I'm going to place
this down at first before using any
product and then just fill in my brows
as usual with the precisely brow pencil
in the shade 3 onto the skin I am going
to take this primer from collection is
their radiance primer I think I'm just
going to bust that in I've been loving
this at the moment and it's only from
the drugstore so it's super affordable
too and then get ready to look slightly
weird but let's get the festival skin it
going I want to glow from underneath I'm
going to mix the color color cover
effects enhancing drops in the shade
sunlight and a candle lit and just buff
that into my skin it's oh I look like a
rustic robot metallic alien type thing
yep now on to foundation I'm going to
take the new foundation from Natasha
Genoa it's the cover
X
datian is super full-coverage I feel
like there's going to be my new favorite
foundation the finish of it is literally
like Photoshop is super super full
coverage and this is the shade medium 42
I think so it kind of matches my talent
everything else I'm obsessed going back
in with the concealer that we used
earlier occurs or why do we need another
one I'm this is the Urban Decay conceal
it in the shade a light warm and I'm
going to place that underneath my eyes
and just all over my face where I want
to brighten it up and just blend that in
it with a damp sponge this is from a
model Zone actually and I really really
like it then I'm going to warm up my
complexion with this cream bronzing
primer from w7 cosmetics and just buff
that all in at my skin and basically on
the perimeters of my skin where I want
to warm it up so for head neck down the
sides of my nose and then just set it
all in place with powder to finish up
the eyes I'm going back in with that
gorgeous fuchsia shade and just running
that along my lower lash line and then
taking the fluffy brush I used to apply
earlier just to really blow it out and
smoke it out then going back in with the
lid shade we used earlier just to
connect the two inner corner and kind of
under lashline shades together and then
on the waterline I'm taking whirlpool
high liner from Marc Jacobs just add a
bit of like turquoise and to match the
outer liquid liner then I just applied
bottom lash mascara and this is the eyes
complete I'm obsessed I love them so
much and they're such complimentary
colors so feel free to mix it up and do
other colors if you want to can warm up
my skin even more I'm going to take Viet
no filter powder from NYX in the shade
golden and applying this blush this is
the extra dimension skinfinish blush
inside just a pinch from Mac then I'm
going to give myself a golden glow and
this is the dark horse skin finish from
jeffree star cosmetics I literally
applied that everywhere I applied that
to my chest as well and the highlighter
in taking the Nicola globe kit from
Anastasia Beverly Hills and the kind of
more ready shade and I'm just going to
apply that as like a base highlight if
that makes sense because we are going to
go in with another highlighter these are
all totally optional if you'd rather
just go for the regular gold shades feel
free to do that but I did want to add a
little bit of blue to tighten with the
greeny eye makeup so I took the blue
shade from the Aurora glow kit and just
place that on the top as like an extra
pop
then of the lips I'm at taking it this a
buxom and lightweight liquid lipstick I
left the shade of it down below I think
it's called a moon light or like moon or
something like that absolutely gorgeous
formula it's so lightweight and easy to
apply and on top I'm going in with the
buxom fill on that lip polish in the
shade Tanya again I'm obsessed this
actually looks absolutely stunning over
nudes as well as like a pink flush then
to kind of go the festival theme you
could have just left it there by wanting
to add a little bit of detail so I went
back in with the vivid eyeliners that we
used earlier and just kind of created a
feather effect on the top and then added
a bit of that prismatic green eye shadow
around the perimeters of my face as well
just to kind of add something different
and look makeup skin kind of look almost
greeny golden so that was the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
