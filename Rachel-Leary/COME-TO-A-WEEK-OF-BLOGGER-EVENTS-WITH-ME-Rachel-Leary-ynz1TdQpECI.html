can't do anything like I'm just in so
much pain and annoying on my week of

I'll Daphne's make sure to make sure
what to show you that here's like a
little bit of a sneak preview and I

just so tidy now like I can't I feel
like it's definitely time for me to film

general I know like flat or I haven't
filmed one yet so I definitely am going
to need to do it that while it's still
clean yeah it did she at quarter past 11

1:00 so I'm going to do a makeup and get
myself ready and then get rid of some
old so I've just done
my makeup I'm planning to wear like red
tonight I can read boys you in red shoes
so I always struggle do I think do I go
for a red lip or doing this like red on
my eyes and I have gone for red on my
eyes men literally obsessed because the
new huda beauty lips tones it again
item sets I'm sure when I post a makeup
picture on Instagram now I'm going to go

would film in my bedroom because I
always like to film I kind of more
chatty and relaxed video so time to get
through all of that clothing haul is
done now I just have to get that all
edited but yeah hopefully everything is
on track I'm not going to run late even
though I know that I am going to quickly
power edit this now and then get it
ready and I'm going to girls but packing
guys we are finally uploading so I got
all the energy done and now just like
cooking I saw something really quick for
like an early issue because I never know
what the food's like at these things
I'm also perhaps and ready to go can you
believe that searching for like one or
two nights it's a bit much and a bit
excessive yeah I guess the next thing
I'd love to chime in at my outfit
completely and I'm ready to go I'm so
excited I can't wait to see everyone and
go my friends as well which is fun
so yes I'm excited for the evening any
channels can you turn so this is why my
favorite meals to make this is literally
just like cool Jackie and then flavored
chicken so it's super healthy and it's
so yummy you never have called Jackie
before such a good substitute for like
some spaghetti if you're trying to be
healthier and as a vegetable I promise
you I'm changing into heels later but
I've literatures got this body suit on
that that is from a Primark the short
that will be in my haul that were up on
Wednesday and a blazer and I just got
like a side part going on but yeah
because it's me I'm in a massive rush to
probably sue probably the next to my job
will be at the event on the way yes
coverage for everyone
ha
ah
the only enemy guys I'm back now look at
this list as a safer
oh yeah sure I'm game honestly I had
such a fun evening
my feet are pretty much nowhere to be
found they have so much below I've
actually run and I can't wait to show my
room this is like the nicest hotel
they've ever students could the colleges
or something like that yeah I know I
can't believe I'm saying that but among
as you mean room range at risk for that
too literally as you walk in just look
how huge
the outside is that's actually bigger
than my whole like flat I'm movin
kidding
but we were greeted with Marc Jacobs
beauty thing hope you have a great stay
raspberry frangipane chocolate with
British strawberries and it contains
nuts so I won't be having any of that
but maybe I'll have a struggle to got a
little TC desk that was a nice view that
I saw out there earlier miss Barton is
insane it's like Marvel goals like sink
toilet I could in bath like the perfect
mirror for selfie yeah I don't actually
know if I said I can't remember I said
what we were doing tomorrow
but the Marc Jacobs thing might give it
away slightly so I can't wait to
vlog tomorrow I'll get so much better
footage tomorrow it's quite hard to look
at the next thing it was just a bit hot
and everyone with sounds a bit dark just
standing around talking so I'm going to
go ahead and get an early night because
tomorrow is going to be so so so much
fun can't wait to slug a few guys and I
can't believe I get to share this stuff
with you so stay tuned for tomorrow
morning guys I've just woken up and put
Jack down on that was the most
comfortable bed ever I'm not surprising
considering the size I have got a coffee
and some mango on the way we are going
to brunch but I have no dinner yesterday
so I knew I was going to wake up and be
like I'll record like empty I can't wait
until 10:30 I've got a little something
coming so I haven't actually even
censored this morning at 10:30 we're
going downstairs at this hotel and we
are having a brunch with Adele's makeup
artists with a global ambassador from
Marc Jacobs which is like we're here
with them which is incredible it's going
to be so many of your favorite people
there and then later on this evening we
are going to go and watch Adele and of
the IP box in Wembley and oh my god I
have never done anything like that
before in my life I can't believe I am
doing that and that's why I literally
cannot wait to vlog today you guys so I
can take you along with me so I'm going
to start with MySpace obviously going to
get some Marc Jacobs in there but I've
been literally obsessed with the elastic
foundation like I know I've used it
before and everything that just recently
I've realized how amazing is and I'm
also trying out the three-in-one like
setting spray from Too Faced and that
goes in facial oil it's giving me such a
gorgeous like do but I'm really really
loving it so this is kind of the bits
that always got on my face is like go-to
and like my velvet says design contour
kit so let's crack on my room service
arrived and obviously I also most basic
thing and it comes looking so amazing
literally hotels like this are
incredible and if it's going to be
absolutely delicious I've got my little
self like I said I'd now just cracked
and loved items and have loved islands
dealmaker eat some mango obviously I
answer the door looking like this no
it's just that you've caught me miss
blend and here's oh oh so I'm all ready
to go I'll do a quick show of my alpha
The Wrap go down to the branch to meet
Michael Adele's makeup artist and to see
everyone else's hair so an amazing
experience about to happen and I
actually can't wait this is my outfit
just like a t-shirt shift when you dress
my Blazers kind of like out turned
slightly back just like a pinstripe
blaze or some boots and my little trusty
bird
so let's go so we were early and now
we're not because it comes to the wrong
floor and now we're panicking air
rushing but the next thing I probably
show you in the different Miller n and
going on did you go the other day I
think
awesome
well welcome welcome Michael a man who
needs no introduction obviously probably
the biggest hometown hero like royalty
of makeup base easier than I thought you
know I'm going to talk the talk I see
what the wall
haha so I tried doing it on myself did
you much harder on someone else that's a
bit like false eyelashes they need to
say that sometimes it's not I really
want to watch that tutorial
yeah like when I do on someone I saw in
the corner and then what always and then
I do the flick law but then I think you
do for me when I try to do all myself it
was much easy street in a corner and
work from the outside in because I think
when you do it seems about natural sort
of shape that your hand mate this is
down with shape where did you come from
the outside in you get a much straighter
line than anybody I that code that's
pretty basic also I'm Vishal well that's
practicing on my mom of that person yeah
hopeful and the empathic is wonderful
when people create like a different
character and an efficient woman you
might wake up one morning and see Alexis
this person or I can feel like a
different woman even it's about
socialism yeah why won't I rent a photo
[Laughter]
I'm holding my brother I'm happy with
that
so you find easier and then they keep
their eyes closed while you're doing it
when I'm doing this yet you carry any
make of it but I think you know we learn
that it's very really going bigger you
get the real effect we're going to so I
am back in my room now but not very long
because I'm about to head over to
Santa's room at with Amy and we're going
to get some lunch room service patty is
literally amazed so I'm sure I'll love
that but then we have some downtime so
I'm just going to do some editing and
chill out when we have a bath or
something and then it is time for like
two rings to get ready and then we are
going to see Adele so I literally can't
wait I'm I hope you guys like the
footage from earlier he is honestly the
most like realest makeup artist ever he
was so down absolutely like a perfect
fit for a doll I know that sounds really
weird but I can see why that he has been
with us literally 10 years I know and
he's the creator that iconic flick so
with such a privilege to meet him and I
think we might get to see him again
later but if not then we just get to
enjoy the show and watch the magic
happen so I literally can't believe
today it's honestly been incredible and
I can't wait to show you later the room
service is arriving hello one that
looked amazing oh the object is I think
it must've hurt if you need oh it looks
so good Pete Oh Hector hammer chips for
actually week's
sandwiches yes but I would do a quick
outfit unknown up of the day while I'm
in this amazing bathroom so this jacket
is actually from Bershka and they do a
matching pair of shorts that as well
which I really like this brother it's in
basket to not sure what the belt is from
but the shorts are new look and these
boots are from
boohoo I just did my hair and like a
low-paid oh and Karla and my makeup is
as usual well as usual a bronze smoky
ina needs it justice if you like that
goes everything and it's super easy to
maintain throughout the night so yeah
we're going to head down at for drinks
in a minute and see everyone and then
hello

on the way to Adele
