today I have joined up with Maybelline
to show you some of my favorite
concealer hacks maybe didn't have such a
massive range of concealers and you guys
know I'm obsessed with them so I'm so so
so happy to be doing this video for you
guys like I said this video basically
includes some of my favorite hacks that
I like to use on a day-to-day basis and
maybe some hacks that you guys didn't
already know or just didn't really know
how to do it's so so so much you can do
with concealers that I was really aware
of and I've discovered and now I've been
really really loving recently and
Maybelline definitely a some of my
favorite concealers to use they're so
affordable and like I said they have
such a diverse range of concealers so
I'm showing you some of my favorite
concealer hacks to use with three types
of Maybelline concealer and I'm sure you
guys will know of them they are
incredible so yeah I really hope you
guys enjoy this video definitely give it
a thumbs up if you did and for more hat
videos and let's jump straight into it
the first three hacks are all going to
be using the maybelline fitme concealer
and this first one is going to be
perfect if you suffer from a puffy eyes
mixing your concealer in with your
moisturizer and a liquid illuminator
really helps to reduce the appearance of
puffy eyes as this concealer has amazing
coverage and it's super blendable so
mixing it all together helps to
illuminate brighten and apply a bit of
coverage to help hide those puffy eyes
this next hack is perfect for people
that need a quick face on-the-go
depositing a bit of the maybelline fitme
concealer on the back of my hand and
mixing it with my moisturizer I'm just
making my own a tinted moisturizer as
like I said this concealer has such a
gorgeous coverage to mix them in with
your moisturizer create the perfect easy
base and it's super blendable as well so
you just almost created your own it
tinted moisturizer without having to buy
a new one
speaking of multi using concealers the
fit me concealer makes the perfect eye
base so you don't have to go out and buy
another one the one stick formula makes
it so so easy to dispense onto your eye
and the formula itself is super creamy
super blendable and it literally doesn't
crease so it makes the perfect eye base
for when you apply your eye makeup these
next few hacks are going to be using the
Dream Lumi touch concealer these are
going to be really helpful for those
that love to be super clean-cut and
precise with their makeup because the
brush tip format of this is super thin
and doesn't dispense too much it has
quite a sheer coverage to allows you to
get super close without dispensing it
too much this one also has a sheer
coverage and really helps to illuminate
and brighten I'm using the shade 0-2 and
as you can see I'm using it to clean and
define my brow and it blends it super
easily and it gives me the perfect brow
bone highlight
this next hack is definitely a go-to for
me if I'm doing a wind eyeliner and I
want it to be a super super sharp the
best way to do it is to use a concealer
to help clean up and obviously sharpen
and define the wing that you've just
created and I'm using this one in a
color close to my skin tone just because
I want it to blend out and look super
super natural and like I said the brush
tip form that allows me to get really
close with a really thin and precise
flat edge then I can drag it down and it
makes it super easier for me to blend
out if you loved a bold lip then this
next hack is going to be it's super
helpful for you once you've applied your
bright color sometimes it just doesn't
look clean-cut and sharp enough so using
the Dream Lumi touch concealer the tip
of this makes this so so easy to just
trace around your lip and the sheer
coverage means that it's not going to
crease or anything like that and taking
a lighter shade as well really helps to
brighten up and really draw attention to
your lips
and finally these next few concealed
hacks are going to be using the
Maybelline age rewind concealer taking a
concealer in the same color as your skin
really helps to give you a much much
more flawless coverage for me the age
rewind concealer in the shade nude is
perfect for this
it really helps like I said to brighten
up underneath my eye even though it's
the same color as you can see the
difference it's made already it really
blends into the skin it's super
effortlessly and gives you a much more
flawless base before you apply I like to
want to do the brightening for you the
next one is a classic one using one that
is a few shades lighter than your skin
tone in an upside down triangle motion
really helps to brighten up underneath
the eye and bring it forward and this
sponge tip formula is a super
comfortable underneath the eye that is a
really sensitive part of your skin you
don't want to be applying too much
pressure there and the sponge tip
formula also really helps you to get
precisely underneath your contour to
make it a lot more defined and prominent
so you're going to be getting those
chiseled cheekbones well the formula of
this one is well is definitely my
favorite it's really kind of medium to
full but it blends super super easily
making it really lightweight on the skin
and last but not least if you guys like
a nude lip like me and always are
finding new ways to make your lips look
fuller
once you've applied your lip if you take
a concealer that is a few shades lighter
than your skin tone and concentrate it
in the center it's really going to bring
the center of your lips forward and give
you more of a fuller pout and the sponge
tip of the age rewind one is perfect for
this as it makes it super comfortable
and it applies easily without dispensing
it too much product and like I said it
just really helps to make your lips look
full and pouty so that is it they were
my favorite concealer hacks featuring
three of the Maybelline concealers I
really hope you guys enjoyed make sure
