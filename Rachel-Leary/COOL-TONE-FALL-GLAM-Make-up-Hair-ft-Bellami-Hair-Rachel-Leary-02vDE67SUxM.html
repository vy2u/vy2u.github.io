today I thought I would do a autumn hair
and a makeup look kind of more on the
glam side and a lot more cool toned to
know I love my wanton looks but
something a little cooler for the people
that prefer their kind of cooler tone
looks and like I said this is a hair
tutorial as well using my Bellamy hair
extensions is like I said I was feeling
slightly more on the glam side and I
love to wear my extensions just a bit
more of volume and length all
information about the extension that I'm
wearing and the tools that I'm using and
stuff will be in the description down
below
I do have a coupon code to get money off
your hair extensions and it is Rach XO
but like I said all information will be
left in the description bar at the
bottom the other guy said I was feeling
something bit more cool term so I've
gone with no like a brownie grey lip and
corresponding eyes and it's a brown wing
liner as well yeah I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you do and let's
get started to begin this look we're
gonna do our eyes first and for that I'm
gonna use a tape and then stick it at an
angle that I want my winged eye shadow
to be so I kind of imagine by the end of
my brow will end and that kind of gives
me a guide then that's a primer I'm
gonna use the Maybelline fit me
concealer and set it with a powder and
for eyebrows taking my deep brown medium
brown and the media matte Brown at
skinny brow pencil and then I'm taking
the Tarte in the bloom to eyeshadow
palette and taking this war matte brown
shade as our initial transition color
and blending that through the crease on
a Mac 2 to 4 brush then i'm taking this
cool gray color the slightly smaller
fluffy brush and just blending that into
the crease to further define it and add
more depth you guys know the draw this
is the kind of classic steps to take
before like a really well blended smoky
eye you want to just keep getting darker
with your colors then going back in with
a 2 to 4 to make sure it's all blended
together before going in with the lid
color I'm taking this shimmery kind of
topia color on a flat brush and just
pressing that across the lid and
blending it into the crease colors to
make sure it's all well blended I'm
taking a slightly smaller fluffy brush
the same way as we did before and just
kind of rubbing her around and then it
taking it this kind of dark purpley
color I know this is a little slightly
warmer shade although all the warmer
times this is a cool toned look but I
thought it complemented it well and I'm
just going in with a fluffy brush and
make sure it's all blended it together
but concentrating it mainly on the
outer part of the eye then taking a
slightly lighter shimmery color I am
concentrating this on the inner part of
our lid to create that light to dark
gradient going across then taking a
matte white eyeshadow from the same
palette I'm using this to highlight my
inner corner and also on my brow bone to
give my like lid space a bit of a lift
and also brighten up my inner corner
because these are quite dark and cool
tone colors then it's the eyeliner I'm
taking the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow in chocolate which is a really
gorgeous deep brown shade and I'm using
this as my eyeliner like I said using a
blank canvas cosmetics eyeliner brush
and this light I love using tape because
you can be as messy as you want and you
know that you're still going to get that
perfect sharp line so this is perfect
for anyone that's not 100% confident in
their eyeliner skills or it's just
generally like a messy person like me
once you are happy with the wing I'm
then going back in with the same palette
and taking this dark dark brown shade
and using this to kind of create a smoky
line effect you trying to concentrate
that where you want the eyeshadow so for
me that was just where the wing was and
a little bit going into the crease and
the lid and then using a fluffy brush to
diffuse that into the other colors going
back in with my two tooth or again this
is like my favorite crease brush ever
just to make sure it's all diffuse
together I'm never always I'm never
picking up any excess product I'm just
using the bristles of the blur brush to
blend it together cut that was a
mouthful and then you want to go ahead
and then apply it on the scar this is
the Tarte TARDIS mascara is 100% my
favorite mascara at the moment you know
me I love a good pair of lashes and
these are the Lily lashes in the style
luxe I get mine from false lashes donut
UK and I'll leave them at linked up
below so this is the finished eyes and
now we can move on it to the skin I met
taking the NYX for first face primer
spray and just spraying that all over my
skin
using a duo fiber brush to blend it all
together just make sure my skin absorbs
it as quickly as possible and I find a
brush map helps me achieve that and the
foundation I'm taking an old favorite
this is the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation stick in the shade one five
three looks a super dark so as you can
see it matches the color of the tan on
my neck so you have to ignore the kind
of transition and plumper stage because
we obviously do blend it out and when we
use a light to concealer as well this is
the Maybelline fit me concealer in the
shade 20 this helps to lighten it up on
the skin so it all works out in the end
don't you worry and I'm just at placing
that in all the places I want to
brighten so for most people that is
underneath the eye on the chin down at
the bridge of the nose and the forehead
so essentially just like your t-zone and
the center of your face just set that in
place I've been loving this at the
moment this is B Kat Von D shade and
light palette I'm taking the two
lightest shades I think it's the banana
shade and then was slightly whiter shade
out of the two I think the other one
slightly more pink I'm just using that
to set everywhere I placed the concealer
in the same palette I'm at taking the
warmest contour color and just taking a
big fluffy brush and using visit to warm
up the perimeters of my face that tend
to be obviously like my forehead and
like cheeks and then like on my neck or
chin
then on a more defined fluffy brush I'm
taking the lighter cooler color out of
the two and using that just underneath
where we placed that warm bronzer color
to kind of get the illusions or that
kind of more deep set cheekbones and
give a more contoured look and then I
take a smaller fluffy brush as well and
I like to apply that down the bridge of
my nose for blusher I'm at taking this
glow all out blush up from that soap and
glory the names it's listed down below
but I thought they only do it one shade
and I'm just using a blusher brush to
apply that and for highlighter I'm at
taking this new gorgeous that kind of
golden that color from makeup geek then
the highlighting range is incredible
those are so pigmented and they blend
it's super easy onto the skin I've
definitely listed the name of this one
and down below I can't remember off the
top of my head right now I'm just
applying that on that my cheekbones and
then on my Cupid's bow and nose to
finish off the eyes I'm taking that
initial shimmery it's silver color and
using that same a fluffy brush and just
running it across my lower lash line and
then further kind of deepening it using
that dark is the brownish shade just on
the outer part then just applying a
bottom that lash mascara and these are
the finished eyes but on it to the lips
then taking this lip pencil from the
next it is like a another cool toned
Brown kind I literally like the color of
coat
and then once I've applied my lip liner
I'm going in with this lipstick from
smash book smash box called warrior pose
and I'm obsessed with them that I've
received that massive PR package with
all of them in and it's the first time
I'm trying one of them and I have to say
I am so impressed with the formula and
the longevity of them so if you haven't
definitely try them out so this is the
finished makeup look obviously something
slightly coulant then what I'm normally
used to but I do love these kind of
great turns around this time of year as
well now it is time to glam our hair I'm
using the Bellamy bambina 20 inch ash
blonde set and each set comes with a
little tester which you should always
use first to check in matches before
opening the whole packet otherwise you
can't return them which you can find at
the bottom but this is like I said the
packet that it comes in Bellamy also
offer a hanger for your extensions which
is super handy for storage and styling
and also a a bag to store and protect
them as well this specific set contains
two of four clips two three clips two
two clips and for single clips so this
is my hair before having extensions so I
definitely get some volume in so I'm
going to start sectioning off my hair
and by doing that I'm gonna leave a
little bit at the bottom and just
clipping the rest of my hair on top of
my head
then taking a brush just gonna back home
at the roots and so the extensions have
something easier to grip onto and then
I'm just taking one of the two ones
placing at the bottom and then letting
my hair down and kind of repeating the
process with all the hair pieces you
want to make sure you leave enough hair
in between each section to be able to
cover the extensions and yeah like I
said you just want to make your way up
just adding an increasing volume by
adding the sets the amount of clips kind
of work towards the kind of size of your
head so you guys will be able to figure
out what size needs to go where on your
own head I do have a discount code for
you guys to get dollar off the hair
extension sets and it is Rach xover I
will leave that down below as well as
the link to the site
as you can see after adding all the hair
I've put so much more length and at
volume you could totally leave it
straight I'm gonna take my 19 millimeter
by 19 millimeter wander from Bellamy
it's part of that six and one curling
set again I do have a discount code for
that as well and it is in the
description down below I think is Rach
160 and I'm just going ahead and curling
my hair I kind of wanted like looser
curls which is why I put the extensions
in first and then I'm curling my hair if
I wanted more kind of precise curls I
would have pre curled my extensions
beforehand then my own hair and then
clicked it in but it's totally up to you
I just found this way I was going to get
more kind of loose Messier waves so
that's the kind of look I was going for
so this is the finished result I'm
absolutely obsessed with the way that my
hair looks and the makeup and everything
all together so I really hope you guys
enjoyed it make sure to give it a thumbs
up if you did and check the description
for everything it down below and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
