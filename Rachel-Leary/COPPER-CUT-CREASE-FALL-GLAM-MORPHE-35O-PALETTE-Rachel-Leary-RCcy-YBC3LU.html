today I'm taking it back to old school
rage if you're a new subscriber and you
don't know what that is one make sure to
hit that subscribe button now and two
this is a look that I used to do all the
time I'm not so much of a fan of winged
makeup anymore but I felt really
inspired I've been seeing loads of like
a really gorgeous fall and makeup with
like big extravagant glam wings and
awesome chicken is I lost are you on
instagram if you follow her she's been
doing mega glam lips at the moment that
I've been obsessing over so this is kind
of inspired by her and I do actually use
her kind of hot collab lip gloss so if
you're like me look at this makes whoa
check out all the products down below
yes like I said this is like an ultimate
coppery winged bronze glam look that you
guys know know know that I love and what
makes this kind of cool is because I'm
using the morphe 35o palette loads of
you have that palette I know it was so
hard to get hold of but throughout the
year there's been other palettes and
stuffs and that one actually became way
more accessible to all of us and it is
literally the perfect full palette if
you've never seen it before you'll see
it in use in this video so I really hope
you guys like this video like the look
of the makeup and get inspired to create
your own full looks as well be prepared
for a lot of makeup I felt like like I
said taking this old-school full glam
using tons of my favorite stuff so I
really hope you guys enjoy make sure to
give it a thumbs up before we get
started and let's go ahead and get
started again I've done my eyebrows
already using my usual favorite products
and I've sculpted and set them in place
using concealer and a brow set and now
onto the main star of the show the
morphe 35o palette I'm going to take
this war matte brown shade and go back
and forth into at my crease I did
already prepped my lids using my
concealer and setting that with powder
like I usually do I am kind of being
overly generous with each shadow that I
apply just because I am gonna be cutting
the crease out and it always looks
better when you over apply which is
handy if you're quite a messy eyeshadow
apply and then it taking this orange
shade here again using a slightly
smaller defined crease brush I think
that's how you would describe it and
just going back and forth all the way in
from inner to outer corner and going
back in with my big fluffy brush you
guys know to get that seamless blend I
always like to use my previous brushes
not with any additional product but just
to kind of help blend it all together so
again just kind of
placing a lot of product into my crease
and blending it out with my big fluffy
brush then I'm going to take this kind
of brick shade here and again just going
back and forth but each time I kind of
apply it less and less onto the lid and
just kind of more and more into the
crease and I want each color to really
really show up and again just going back
in with each previous brush because it
will always have a little bit of the
previous color on it which really helps
to blend everything out so like I said
this is a really good technique or a way
of doing I don't looking good if you're
quite messy with your eyeshadow and you
have quite a bigger lid space like I do
so this is really helpful
and then going in with this warm dark
brown shade here this is gonna be the
darkest color that we use but again just
kind of really small smoothly applying
it on the outer most part of the eye but
taking it all the way across the lid and
using each brush to blend it all
together this is not my favorite brushes
to use it's almost like a giant pencil
brush so really good at kind of placing
colors in the crease cuz it's nice and
fluffy but it has a tapered end to it
which I really appreciate and there yeah
blending it back and forth with the
brushes and to carve out my crease I'm
gonna be using the concealer that I used
to prep my eye and I'm gonna be using it
on my face cuz y'all know I love to
multi-use a product and I'm just gonna
be carving out the crease just by
placing the concealer onto the crease
directly then just taking like a small
synthetic brush and making sure to look
down into a mirror and I do always kind
of like to lift my eye up and then down
just to check that I am placing it in at
the right place and then like I said I
just go ahead and do it on the other eye
god that was a mouthful get out but now
I'm gonna take this shimmery bronze
color this is more of like a lighter
copper I'm just gonna be placing this in
the inner most part of the lid and kind
of taking it halfway across because I am
gonna be transitioning it and took
another color so I didn't want it to be
the full color and the other kind I'm
gonna be using is this gorgeous shimmery
copper this is properly properly
probably more of the copper shade so you
could totally just do the whole lid with
this I didn't have to be like a shimmery
a gradient going across the lid into the
dark mattes as you can see here I'm just
going back in with that precise fluffier
brush just to define the crease a little
bit more and then I am gonna create the
wing using these wipes if you were
interested I thought some of you guys
might want to be wannabe might want to
know what wipes I use and I love these
ones cause they're super moisturizing on
wet so they really clean up or the
product so I just kind of create the
wing and then before I actually do the
wing with eyeliner I always like to
highlight my inner corner just because
sometimes I take the eyeliner all the
way into the inner corner now for
eyeliner I'm taking the NYC black liquid
liner but as you can see here I did
initially start off with the gel I
thought I was gonna be able to do it but
no me and Jo eyeliners just don't get on
so I switched it back to my fav which is
the NYC black liquid liner you've never
tried it before I think you can only get
it
Amazon anymore but I've left it in the
link down below I'm just kind of
creating a really big shot old when I
haven't done one of these in ages and I
forgot how much I kind of love it now on
to it mascara and lashes I'm just gonna
be using the Koko lashes in Queen B so
obsessed forgot how much I love these as
well I've left a link to them down below
now onto the skin I'm gonna take
beatbeat taking the fastly rose gold
elixir oil darling and just massaging
that into my skin my skin felt so so so
dry and this oil actually works really
nicely under makeup but I do make sure
is fully absorb before applying any
different product and for primer I'm
taking these stealer one-step primer
this is a super hydrating primer it also
smooths and really it nourishes the skin
as well so I've been loving this
recently too with the skin all done I'm
gonna be mixing these two foundations
together and I'm mixing them because one
of them is slightly more of a yellow
undertone and one of them has slightly
more of a warmer undertone and I didn't
want to be like more of each undertones
that make sense so I thought why not mix
together and as you guys know I do love
to stipple it on and then go in with my
Beauty Blender to get the maximum at
coverage so if the concealer again using
the same one as before and I love this
shade it's in the shade canal it was one
of the new shades that they came out
with when they kind of expanded their
range it's not too light it's a really
gorgeous yellow undertone and yeah like
I said it's not too like so I don't get
too too much of a bright under-eye but
it's not as dark or as like yellow as
custard which I also really like it's
kind of like a hybrid between custard
and vanilla if that helps anyone but
then I just go ahead and set my face
with powder and go back to the eyes I
love this eye pencil this is from
L'Oreal in super copper and it just ties
in with the eyes makeup so so so much
and then I'm just taking this shade here
to kind of buff and blend that out but
then I am gonna go back in with my big
fluffy brush and just kind of diffuse
that so it kind of blends a lot nicer
and it's not just kind of like one big
smudge underneath my eye but I didn't
pick up any excess product but these are
the finished
eyes now we can move a back onto the
skin god I love that eye look but yeah
back onto the skin that this is the
benefit hoola bronzer literally my go-to
at the moment for contouring and also
warming up the skin and just use
a kind of big cheek brush to do that and
down my neck and jawline as well I
wanted to kind of keep the blusher of
the coppery theme so this is the Milani
baked blush in volitional bronze and I
almost use this as like a shimmery
bronzer as well so I do take it up onto
my forehead but it does have such a
gorgeous copper finish
I'm obsessed and for highlighter I'm
taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid glow in peach fears applying it
with a brush but they're not blending it
out with my finger cuz the warmth of my
finger really kind of blends that in
seamlessly I really didn't mean to flip
you guys off just then sorry about that
and ah so excited for this product this
is the Maybelline master chrome
highlighter in multi gold coming to us
in at December or like just around that
sort of time
I'm obsessed look at that glow now for
the lips I'm taking the Charlotte
Tilbury lip cheat in iconic nude I
really wanted like a I don't know what's
the word just like a proper nude lip and
I love this lip pencil it goes with
everything I'm then going to be taking a
beanie babe baby babe
Ricci me babe from the hood of beauty
which is a gorgeous warm peachy nude so
perfect in this look and then like I
said earlier topping it off with the
color pop and I love Sarah huge collab
in curvy and I literally love this gloss
I think this is a gloss that she's been
using obviously a lot recently which
really inspired me to use it as well but
this is the finished makeup look
old school Rachel glam I am obsessed
