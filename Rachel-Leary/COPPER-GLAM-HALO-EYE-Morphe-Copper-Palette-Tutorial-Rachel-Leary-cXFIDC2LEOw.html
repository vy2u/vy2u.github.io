today I've filmed a makeup look using
the new limited edition Morpheus 25a or
the copper palette that has recently
been released I've seen it so much hype
that at the moment and it's that you
might dream palette I love these kind of
warm tones we thought I brought bright
orange jumper and stuff just to kind of
tie everything all together and because
this is kind of like a orangie copper
ealer is kind of like a halo eye type
style and it's just one of the many
things you can do with this palette and
I paired it with a slightly warmer
darker nude lip that I you normally go
for yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed
this look if you didn't know already I'm
actually currently in Los Angeles 1 this
video goes up so definitely make sure to
follow me on snapchat which is Rach
leery just so you can keep up to date
with what I'm doing but yeah I really
hope you guys like the look of this look
and if you want to learn how to do it
then please keep watching
okay so tip again I'm going to prime my
eyes using my Kat Von D look at tattoo
concealer and I'm going to be taking
this above my eyebrow as well and also
slightly underneath just because we are
going to be using this on our face as
well I wanted to all to blend in like
easily that makes sense
I'm just going to set that in place with
powder then I'm going to go ahead and do
my brows and for this I'm using my
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow a medium
brown just for the tail or actually
might been soft brown for the tail and
then through the front of the brow I'm
going to take this NYX micro brow pencil
I think in the shade blonde and it's
really similar to the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow is which I'm obsessed with
and yeah it's a new product for me and I
really like the look of the brows and
then I'm going to take the morphe 25/8
copper palette and mix these to warm up
brown orangie shades together you guys
know the drill and for this I'm just
going to buff this into the crease to
create that soft effect and then I'm
just going to take that orange shadow
and use this to further deepen up the
crease only kind of placement on the
outer part and also on the very inner
part and then connecting it slightly
over the middle and then taking my big
fluffy brush and making sure it's all
blended together seamlessly
then it taking this deeper warm brown
shade again at concentrating this on the
outer most part and then on the inner
most part and that's how to kind of
create that halo effect I always like to
go back in with my fluffier brushes as
well just to diffuse the colors together
and make sure it is all blended together
as best as I can then yeah like I said
just blending together using my original
fluffy brush I think this one is from a
sigma and it's definitely one of my
favorites then I'm taking this dark
brown shade again to place it in the
same place if that makes sense and then
going back in with my previous brushes
just to make sure it's all diffused and
blended together because we do want to
create that gradient effect even though
this is still a halo eye then I'm mixing
these two shimmery shades together for
the kind of halo part of this look and
I'm obsessed it's like a yellow gold and
a bronzed together so mixing them create
the perfect color I'm obsessed with it
and then going back in with a little
pencil brush I'm using that to diffuse
the matte shades with the shimmery
shades and then just using at my Mac to
1-7 and not picking up any additional
product just blending it all together
and now even though it's a halo eye you
could totally keep it rounded but I did
want to wing it out I'm not going to be
applying any eyeliner but I just kind of
wanted that more
elongated shape so I just cleaned it up
with a wipe and then I am highlighting
my inner corner using this highlighter
from make up eat which I planned to use
on my face and then using a flat definer
brush taking a a dark brown eyeshadow
just to line our lashline and then apply
mascara so it looks and blends a lot
easier when we apply false lashes and
for that I am at taking the opulence
lashes from Lily lashes which look like
this then I'm just going to go ahead and
up prime my skin and this is the
Illamasqua radiance veil it is a really
really gorgeous luminous finish to the
skin as you will see and it almost works
like a strobe cream but it's a primer so
I really like it and for foundation I'm
going to take the cover FX cream
foundation just on a kabuki brush to
blend it all in and this color doesn't
match the color of the tan on my neck
but I am avoiding using underneath my
eyes because it's really full coverage
and the Kat Von D consider that I'm
using is also really full coverage so I
didn't want to kind of apply it away it
too much and it be really thick
underneath my eyes because that's how
you can get creasing and stuff so yeah I
just kind of avoided putting foundation
there as well then I'm taking this as a
waver contour pan I'm taking the banana
shade just to set underneath my eyes and
it brighten it up and then I'm taking
from the same palette the more cool tone
contour shade and I'm just using it that
- obviously it chisel out my cheekbones
and just and the little downloads of my
nose and just any way that I want to
make appear it's smaller and then using
the slightly warmer shade from the
palette I'm going to be using this as a
bronzer on my big fluffy brush and just
applying this around the perimeters of
my face again just to warm up my
complexion
now I'm taking it this a blusher palette
from NYX and I'm taking the orange e
shade just to kind of complement with my
eyes and the whole eye look that we have
going on and then finally going back in
with the highlighter that we use as the
inner corner highlight and just placing
this on the top of my cheekbones and
just to create a little bulb on my nose
and on my Cupid's bow as well and then
just going to line my waterline up with
it teddie pencil from Mac I've been
really liking doing this at the moment I
think I kind of used to avoid it but I
think it makes my eyes kind of pop so
I'm just using that and it's nice warm
up Brown
then it taking that medium warm up brown
shade and kind of repeating the process
that we did on the top on
bottom so just applying it to the
outermost part and the innermost part of
my inner corner and then I'm at taking
the shimmery shade and just placing it
in the inner part of the eye like we
have on the top and then just applying
bottom lash mascara to complete the eyes
for the lips I wanted something warm and
brown as well so I am at taking Ashton
at liquid lipstick from Anastasia
Beverly Hills as something a little bit
different I feel like you could go with
a totally dark brown lip or even a nude
lip as well and then I'm just going to
highlight my Cupid's bow again just
because I feel like I kind of lost that
when I applied the liquid lipstick
and this is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you did
and definitely make sure to follow me on
snapchat which is Rachael eerie as I'm
currently in Los Angeles and that's
