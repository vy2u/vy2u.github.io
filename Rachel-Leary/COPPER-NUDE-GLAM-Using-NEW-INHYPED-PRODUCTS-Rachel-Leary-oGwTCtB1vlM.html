as you can probably tell by the title
and I kind of I always start my videos
like this but I've recently got my hands
on some new makeup and I'll see some new
appear our makeup that I feel has been
so hyped recently like the desert sands
oh my god I feel like in the video I've
called it desert sands but it's desert
does it doesn't dusk a palette from huda
beauty some new brow roots and color /
some new desi Katy dose of colors and
relax and then a bunch of products I
feel like might have been hyped in the
past but I never got my hands on so yeah
I just wanted to try everything out kind
of new over the first time let you guys
know what my thoughts on them at so you
guys know whether or not is worth the
height and worth getting I did a look
that I'm comfortable with it it's tiny
more dark on the eyes than normal and
I've gotta find that lip for a change so
I hope that's diverse enough for you I
always like to try it looks in ways that
I would actually try them because then
I'm actually gonna get a real feel for
the products and how I would actually
use them on a day-to-day basis if you
like the look of this video already then
that's amazing and please give it a
thumbs up and leave me some love in the
comments down below and definitely make
sure to hit that subscribe button but
without further ado if you want to know
how I got this look and what products I
used to do it then please keep watching
ready okay so if you don't already
follow me on snapchat our insert here I
have already done my skincare and quite
an intensive skincare routine this
morning so in terms of skincare before
makeup I'm gonna be using this this is
new in an cult beauty is the coconut
milk it missed by a brand called too
cool for school I also got like a golden
mask from there which I actually really
really loved this is literally just like
a facial mist of like coconut water and
which is really hydrating so I've been
really excited to try it like I said it
was like a new brand that launched on
cult Beauty so I wanted to get a few
bits from there oh my god literally it
smells like coconut but yeah I'm just
gonna be using that as like my
moisturizer their packaging is so cute
too so I left the link to it down below
if you want to check out all the other
bits that they do so moving on to primer
I'm taking this one from Nick
this is accorded their illuminating a
primer I actually went on to pop beauty
and light self joys and all that kind of
stuff
clicked the new in and just kind of saw
all the new products I've launched in
each category that I hadn't got my hands
on yet and this was one of them so this
wasn't called beauty as a new in primer
it's an illuminating primer I feel like
it's gonna be like the max true okay
yeah well it looks I did a lot of it on
my hand and it looks like the map strobe
cream in terms of their like pearlescent
finish and stuff but it's a lot thicker
in consistency and feels really nice in
terms of like a primer it feels super
super smooth on my skin so we're going
for a bronzy a glowy look because that
is the easiest way for me to really test
out products in a way that I would
actually wear them and a lot of the new
in products that I got or have received
all that like being really hyped about
them I like new either holiday or fall
related products and those ones all are
like very warm toned seasons of the year
so I've just applied that primer and I
can already see there like a luminosity
if that's the word like from my skin it
feels so nice and my skin as well okay
fingers crossed this makes me makeup
stay tuned I'm gonna do a little bit of
like a different technique
so I'm actually gonna apply a my
concealer first and then my foundation
around my face and the reason I'm doing
that is because I kind of will put a
bright under-eye and I feel like when
you apply your concealer on top of your
foundation sometimes you can lose the
brightness of it and I'm gonna be using
two concealers today I asked you guys on
Twitter and it was such like a mixed
response so I kind of gonna use both
ones not out yet but one is but so I'm
kind of just testing it for you first
one I'm gonna be applying is the new
Rimmel lasting a breathable 25 hour
concealer so this one gonna put
underneath like as like my base
concealer underneath my eyes
just like that and then I'm gonna blend
that in with my sponge and take it also
up onto my eyes to act as like a little
bit of a primer for when we prime as
well but this is just gonna help get rid
of like discoloration underneath my eyes
and then the other one I'm gonna use I'm
gonna use that as like the brightening
one because I've got it in like a pretty
light shade I think to be able to test
it out I think so the next concealer
that I'm going to use is the cover
effects cream concealer I love the cover
effects cream foundation so I'm so
excited to see that they had a concealer
and this one is in the shade and light
so I'm just gonna kind of drop this
underneath or I could draw it underneath
and then I'm actually gonna buff it out
kind of with like a blending brush just
to really like maximize the coverage
maximize the brightness and then just
kind of really like buff and diffuse it
out it is quite thick though so I might
go in my sponge afterwards and I try and
do as much as I can with a brush I've
also seen the makeup artists that do
like really full coverage plan use this
technique so I just gonna want to turn
try out a different method for you guys
and just see if this actually makes my
under-eye like brighter and it would be
okay I think I applied like oh my god I
look so funny I dunno if I love it too
much I'm probably gonna have to use my
sponge okay going back in with the
sponge yes so that considers actually I
think that technique would have worked a
little bit better if that concealer
wasn't so like thick and creamy but in
terms of the coverage this has
incredible coverage right now next up
it's not a new product but kind of a
high product that I can't believe I've
never tried it is the 'deal skin err
flush flush flush foundation I got mine
in the shade at 300 now I've seen many
people kind of suggest ways to apply it
but a lot of people just said it was
easier to just spray it onto the sponge
and then apply so I think I'm gonna do
that obviously cuz I've already done my
concealer I'm just gonna be applying it
like the perimeters of my face
uncle Cole Cole Cole Cole Cole caught
really really really cold
okay so I think the color is a really
nice like match on to my neck and stuff
Wow okay this is like a really pretty
finish remember I'm not taking it
underneath my eyes because I want it to
remain right there okay so far I really
love the coverage and the finish of that
I'm so impressed I can't believe it like
we just said that I waited that long to
try it loads of you did say that you
also wanted me to try the new Rimmel one
so I'm feeling maybe I'll do like a
drugstore the whole face of drugstore
again maybe and like we can test them
out properly there but I don't actually
have a new powder or anything or new
cream contour product so I'm just gonna
go ahead and set my face with powder and
then we'll be back to do the eyebrows
okay so let's move on to eyebrows and a
recently a color pop just launched some
kind of like micro brow pencils which
I've been loving I love a micro brow
pencil and this one I think is in the
shade dark brown so I'm just gonna go
ahead and fill them in like I usually
would so just kind of tracing the bottom
of my brow and then kind of creating the
kind of top of my brow that I want so I
always have to extend a little bit up
and down and then create my own tail
like that then I just kind of gradually
filled them in I've been thinking about
maybe getting my brows micro bladed so
like they're permanently extended and I
don't have to you know do the extension
work that I normally do this how the
hell is this dark brown sorry it just
looks really like grey and there's not a
huge amount of pavement
anyway as I get towards the front I just
kind of brush through and then extend
kind of here and then feather up okay
it's me I feel like I need a little bit
like more
pigmentation from this so I'm gonna go
ahead and kind of fill in the tail of my
brow a little bit more with like a dip
brow or something and then I am gonna go
ahead and do it one eye off camera just
because I want to play around and I'm
just gonna see what look how when I come
up with and then I'll be back to it show
you how it did but think bronze sexy
sultry we're gonna be using the who WG
does it sounds pallet which is kind of
why I wanna have a look and like analyze
and see what's going on so I'll be back
I'm gonna keep the powder under my eyes
though okay we're back and brows are
complete you know still kept like the
powder on underneath like I said and I
did one eye so what we're gonna use
today I can't lift it because one of the
SH like glitters came kind of broken but
we are using the huda beauty a desert
dusk eyeshadow palette when I saw the
like press for this palette I literally
and gagged this lips like me and a
palette of a so obsessed it looks
incredible for autumn the purple tones
look amazing I can't wait to maybe do
something slightly more colorful if you
guys want to see that but I'm gonna dip
my brush in this light orange shade here
which is called Eden I'm just gonna
blend that back and the fourth oh my god
this is like so pigmented but that was
just like one dip and just use that as
our initial that transition color and
then gonna take a slightly a smaller
fluffy brush and take the shade glazing
which is this one here I'm just gonna
making my way around the palette and
dipping my brush into like each darker
shade of brown but yet this is the shade
blazing and I'm just gonna use that to
deepen up the crease and just create
this transition and just diffuse it all
together on a another smaller fluffy
brush I'm gonna take the shade amber
which is the one that is next to the one
that we used originally again a lot more
it's a slightly darker Brown more
they're like a brick kind of color
keep on button into the crease I love
that there's so many like matte shades
that kind of transition into each other
it makes a blending so much easier
because palettes that only come with
like a few match
it kind of just limits their like
blending ability within that like one
pallet you know I feel a lot of the time
at pallets I'm missing like a black or
like a dark brown or like that middle
tone Brown that they might have like a
light brown that it goes straight into
like a dark brown and the way to get
that like seamless blend is to kind of
use more color or like dip and dab in
between colors so I love that you can
get that with this palette okay so the
next shade I'm going to take is saffron
which is slightly more of a pinky Brown
and again this is on a slightly smaller
fluffier brush just buff that and when I
did it on my first eye I wasn't sure
whether I wanted to use a saffron or
just go straight to them
it's called ode I think it's like the
dark matte Brown of the palette but I'm
so glad I added this and it's like the
perfect transition from like orange to
brown like it's not even that pink it's
so pretty I think if you have a green
eyes at this color
like all over your eye as if a matte eye
look would look stunning
okay now we're gonna move on it to the
lid color but before I actually like a
plier I noticed that the pigmentation of
these glitters and like the foiled
shadows they're pretty good but they're
even better and you'll get the most out
of them by using a base so I'm gonna use
the NYX a multitasker base and I found
that that just enabled the glitter
particles and also then the foiled
shadow likeness it gave it something to
cling to and it looks so much better so
don't just watch these videos that are
going around at the moment that saying
this palette like doesn't work I mean
everything is like tried and tested and
everyone's got their own method but I
recommend definitely using that sullied
liquidy base this one is clear which is
why I like it and I use it for literally
everything if I want the pigmentation of
like a pigment to be even better or
something like that this is like a
lifesaver product so I've just applied
that a thin layer of that to my lid and
we're going to go in
this shade which is like the Blood Moon
shade a super gorgeous copper so you
guys know I was gonna be dabble in my
brush on that one
yeah just pack it on see the way that it
just kind of clings instantly it also
minimizes any sort of Fallout and yet
the pigmentation just pups honey pups oh
how gorgeous is that okay I'm actually
gonna take a little bit more of that
adhesive place it kind of right in the
middle between the shimmer and the matte
matte crease color and I even know it's
mashed I am gonna take that Cosmo shade
and I'm gonna use that as the transition
between the shimmer that we've got going
on on the lid and then the darkness
because it's kind of like a dock shimmer
if that makes sense I'm just gonna press
it between and just kind of create a
little bit of a shimmer accent and
transition okay and then like I said I
was gonna do I'm just gonna finally dip
my brush into the darkest Brown which i
think is called ode and just use that to
further define and smoke out the crease
okay this isn't a new product but this
is just the L'Oreal infallible gel
crayon waterproof eyeliner in the shade
super copper and I'm just gonna run that
along my waterline to kind of tie
everything together once you've done
that I'm just gonna dip a pencil brush
into that amber shade which was kind of
like the third transition color that we
use and just a buff and smoke that out
or you get a parcel and then once you've
done now I'm gonna go back in with that
owed color on a flat brush and I'm just
gonna run that along my lower lash line
and on my top lash line as well to
really smoke out this lip okay I'm just
obsessing with how likes my Z and sultry
this looks but the Hooda palette doesn't
actually come up like a highlight T in a
corner shape that's a bright enough for
me so I'm gonna take this new palette
from Rimmel and take the white shimmery
shade from it too this is their
magnifies color edition ones I'm not
sure if they are out yet but they came
out with at least like four different
kind of ranges and shades of this
palette and guys the pigmentation is
like phenomenal thank you girl
oh I love it love it love it okay so for
mascara I'm actually going to use two as
well the first one is a from a wire cell
it is a vinyl short mascara and I'm only
gonna be using these on this on my top
eyelashes just because I am gonna be
wearing a falsies and this mascara gives
a very like a natural separated defined
lash which is perfect if you're gonna be
wearing falsies because you buried any
mascara anyway I love that really really
like a natural mascara so if you're not
into anything too clumpy or anything
definitely give that one a go but for
the bottom ones I'm gonna be taking the
new Rimmel London wonderfully a real
mascara and it's an extreme black and
this one actually contains fiber so the
kind of like consistency of this is very
still thick and moosie but it's got five
is in it and the brush is very defined
and separated so you're gonna get that
really kind of thick voluminous lash but
still with separation which I want my
lower lashes because I want there to be
a lot more drama going on there you know
what I mean now if my favorite part is
the time to apply lashes but because
this eye look is like so dramatic I
didn't want anything to kind of be it
too like to take any attention away so
I'm gonna take these new ones from
ICONic the name isn't on this one like
on the Box anywhere cuz I think it only
came with the plastic but I feel like
they only have a couple of styles and
the name of this one is the slightly
more natural name because this is the
slightly more natural lash I feel like I
want to say
so flawless lash or something I'll have
left a link to it down below but I'm
gonna go ahead and apply these and then
I will show you the finished eyes can we
just take a moment for these lashes I
had to like trim them a little bit but
oh my god they are they memorize a
little bit right I feel like that's all
the eyeshadow but they are so cute they
are so fluffy it's so natural and like
perfect looks like this they don't steal
any attention away from like what is
going on the eyes oh my god I really
loved them I will leave the name to them
down below but yeah they are from iconic
London ok let's move on to the face so a
new a bronzer that I got was from a
color pop now the annoying thing is they
don't actually say the names of them on
the back like they came in a big batch
of all the different shades but I can't
see where it says the name of this one
so I googled the swatches and this one
kind of looked closest to the one that
I've listed the name of down below so
apologies if I got it wrong but they do
do loads of shades bi-color pop did do
bronzers before but I never liked that
old formula it just there was no color
payoff at all so I'm so glad that they
kind of took that on board and every
brand these because these are really
nice so I'm just gonna use this to warm
up the face they also came out with
highlighters too which again they did do
before but I feel like these compressed
ones are a lot better and I was gonna
use that until I got a brilliant citing
highlighter which I was like oh my god
obviously you're gonna be using that one
okay moving on to blusher I feel like
this is more like a new shade for me and
more of like a hyped product than like a
new new product now this is one of the
Abeka mineral blushes in the shade wild
honey and if I remember correctly I
heard about this ages ago through Jaclyn
hill and she was just like I love this
blush as the perfect color and you don't
like a lot of blusher this is like again
the perfect color
it just gives such a gorgeous flush of
color on the cheeks it has such a
gorgeous gorgeous like shimmer like
iridescent finish glow to the skin
that's kind of why but I heard it's like
a high product by Jaclyn
so pretty it has like a bronze elements
in it too and really gorgeous glow but
then like sorry he oh my god I'm like
blushing over a blusher help me and now
we can move on to highlighter and
highlighter I'm gonna be taking the desi
and Katy dose of colors collaboration
and this is in the shade swag oh okay
okay okay let's move on to the lips
I think cuz we've got such kind of like
shimmery eyes going on and shimmery skin
I'm gonna keep it matter shaaka
I know I was gonna use the Becca liquid
crystal like lip chopper but I feel like
no will keep it matte so for lipliner
I'm taking this one from it cosmetics
which is finally launched in Selfridges
in the UK so it's a lot easier to get
hold of and this one is in the shade but
nude okay and then some lipstick again
it is a another one of it the desi a
Katy it dose of colors lab and this one
is in the shade no shade slightly more
of a like peachy and nude so I thought
that kind of tie in with their orange
shades of the eyes I love that color I
think that's such a gorgeous sight
mid-tone peach but I think that is the
finished look I'm gonna go ahead and
spray my face again with the coconut
milk mist because this actually helps
somebody like refresh your makeup so
this I'm not wearing this as like a
setting spray I'm just kind of
refreshing my face with it okay I'm now
I'm just gonna like take these cat ears
out and put my hips in and yeah this is
the finished look so this was the
finished makeup look I really hope you
