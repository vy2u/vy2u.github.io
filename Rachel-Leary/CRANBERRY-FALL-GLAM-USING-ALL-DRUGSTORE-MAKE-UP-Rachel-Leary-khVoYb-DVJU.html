today's makeup look is a completely
drugstore makeup look and is this kind
of cranberry halo I thought this is
perfect for the full time and I did ask
you guys what kind of full drugstore
makeup that you wanted to see so many of
you said like cranberry eyes or halo
eyes so bright do halo eye makeup and I
really love doing I think it looks super
kind of like eye catching and
captivating so I wanted to do that for
you guys today like I said is using all
that super affordable drugstore perks
I've left everything at links down below
and a majority of it is from the same
place which makes that a lot easier for
you guys you could totally pair this
with like a berry colored lip or
something to tie it all together but I
wanted to do something a little bit more
wearable and I had so many like new at
nude like the glossy poppin products I
wanted to share with you guys so I went
for the nude option choker I love the
way this look that came out you can see
it's super like glowy skin a juicy lip
and this like a really gorgeous glittery
cranberry and gold halo I like I said
again perfect for autumn so if you like
the look of this makeup look already
definitely make sure to hit that thumbs
up button subscribe before you leave it
for more tutorials and videos and all
that good stuff come on and join the fan
but without further ado let's go ahead
and show you how I did it so luckily for
this look my favorite skin care does
normally tend to come from the drugstore
so this is one of my favorite
moisturizers this is the Garnier and
moisture bomb day cream I think so I'm
just gonna use that to hydrate my skin
and for primer I'm gonna take the NYX
illuminating a primer I love the feel of
this it has like a real tacky feel to it
so I know the foundation is gonna clean
on top but it has a really gorgeous glow
which I'm obsessed with and this whole
look is gonna be about glowy skin for
foundation I'm gonna use the Rimmel
lasting I think it's like breathable 25
hour full coverage foundation I forget
how much I really really like this and
the applicator is pretty cool too it
makes it super easy to apply so I just
do a few it stripes all over my face and
then I blend it in with a Beauty Blender
the color of this foundation I have
listed down below but it is hard to see
it to a match my tan and I am gonna take
the kind of matching concealer that goes
with this foundation as I feel that's
what always works best so this is the
lasting and breathable concealer from
Rimmel as well in the shade light and
just gonna be a planet and all the
craters that I want to brighten up so
you guys know the drill underneath my
eyes around like my smile lines on my
chin and I also like to take the kind of
residue of that concealer onto my
eyelids to use as my primer and then
just set everything in place I'm gonna
take the collection at to 8,000
translucent powder to help brighten up
underneath my eyes and set everything in
place so it's not gonna budge all day
and keep everything kind of mapped to
begin with we are gonna add the globe
back onto the skin but for contour I'm
gonna take the medium up contour kit
from sleek and just apply that to all
the places that I want to appear like
smaller so that's the cheekbone area my
jaw line I don't usually take it up onto
my board because I feel like I don't
really have a big forehead but I do like
to take my bronze up onto my forehead to
warm everything up which is what I will
be doing next so this was just the kind
of the contour part but now we can warm
up the skin you guys know I love a
shimmery bronze that this is from Rimmel
again and it's their radiance brick I
feel like I've used this quite a few
times but I love the color of this it's
not too orange or anything like that so
it doesn't really make you look too
orange it just warms up your skin really
nicely and gives the most or just below
and speaking of blow I've recently got
my hands on this this is the strobe dome
from it's sleek as well and it's the
most gorgeous bronze color so I thought
I'm gonna try this out so I took it all
around my forehead or my cheekbones too
and then just blending it in with a
stippling brush oh my god I felt like J
that it gave like such a gorgeous subtle
bronze glow to the skin and the
undertone of it is like my favorite kind
of color for bronzy cotton and I can see
kind of one more time I'm gonna kill
myself
bo just gave the most gorgeous glow and
this blusher is well kissed the most
gorgeous glow is the peach party blusher
from that slope so I hand it for Laurie
and you moving on it to eyebrows this is
the NYX micro brow pencil in a medium
brown I think so I kind of use this
towards the end of my brow applying a
lot more pressure and then when I get to
the front of my brow I use like that
flicking up motion to mimic the
appearance of a brow hairs and I have
like so many different tones in my hair
at the moment so I like to take the
blonde
lore'l brow artist plumper to kind of
match the blond ashy tones running
through my hair but now we can move on
to eye shadows this is the NYX ultimate
eye shadow and I can't member the name
of it but left it down below and I'm
just taking the lightest brown shade and
using that as our initial transition
color kind of concentrating the product
on the inner and outer corner but also
kind of buffing all the way across and
that's exactly what I do with the
reddish color too
so kind of in an outer corner and then
connect it over the top going back in
with the big fluffy brush that we use
with that initial Ram its shade to make
sure it's all blended together you guys
can kind of see what I'm doing here just
going from light to dark the concentrate
on the inner most and the outermost
parts of the eye and that's how we get
that halo effect and then always going
back in with my fluffy brushes to make
sure it's all blended together then I'm
taking the shimmery is gold from the
eyeshadow palette on the center you
could have totally used the berry colors
or anything like that I did take the
berry color as you can see to kind of
make it more of a transition I really
really like to be affected that
I definitely wanted a gold in the center
cuz I'd wanted to use this this is like
a glitter eyeliner from a collection in
the shade funk I thought it matched
perfectly with this look and gave such a
gorgeous like glitter and then I'm going
in with the darkest brown shade on the
innermost and ultimate again to kind of
finish off the halo effect and I
basically just mimic what I did on the
top on the bottom with the glitter in
the middle and dark either side now for
the waterline I wanted something a
little bit different this is the UH la
la lineup from sleek in the shade raisin
the most gorgeous cranberry color and
then I just had at me in a corner apply
it some mascara and lashes these are the
lashes from a pink ego and I've
replicated them down below now I can
finish off the skin if this is the a
Maybelline it strop stick and I love
this as a base for my actual powder
highlighter you guys know I love doing
this and this gives the most gorgeous
glow again that would that sleek thing
oh I literally was obsessed with the way
that my skin looked but as I said I'm
gonna go with a powder I don't have been
loving loving loving this at the moment
the a Maybelline master
chrome highlighter in a molten gold on
the top oh my god I'm literally obsessed
my skin was poppin but now we can move
on to lips this is the NYX move lip
liner I'm just using that to outline my
lips its dominate this is actually kind
of more of a darker color than I usually
would go for I normally would go to
something a bit more brown but I wanted
to tie in with a kind of cranberry turns
on the eyes but work
extra with electronics today so first
we're going in with the NYX lip lingerie
in oh my god I can't remember I think
it's like stricter ribbon or something
like that
I can't left the name of it down below
which is a matte but now we're gonna use
tube losses so this is the NYX butter
gloss in fortune cookie I feel like in
the drugstore next it's just number one
for like a nude products I'm obsessed
and then this oh my god this is from
Rimmel it's a lip are in a blush gold
this is the finished makeup look besides
I've seen we're gonna sell our face the
NYX jury mist obsessed obsessed itself
so that was the finished makeup look I
