to me in the obviously
I know
so I'm finally at the hotel that we're
staying at in Los Angeles and if you
guys didn't already know although I
could guess you could tell by the title
I'm in Los Angeles with Too Faced to
celebrate their sweet peach lawn so
basically at their launch launch they
are coming back out with their sweet
peach palette and a bunch of new other
products inspired by the kind of whole
peachy theme and the event for that it's
tomorrow night so we're just kind of
here tonight event tomorrow and then
we'd fly back to Friday so it's a really
short trip I am it so excited trying to
ignore their like jet lag side of things
and just get on with it cuz I want to
make the most of it I don't want to
sleep on earth I've never been to Los
Angeles before SOI 107 want to make the
most of my time here I think I'm just
gonna quickly shower and begin editing a
video but then at me and Emily are gonna
go and get some food because I think
it's only like nearly it's half plus
five here but we had like an 11 hour
flight and we left it like quarter to
1:00 so the timings that's everything is
just thought but yeah they're visually
astir and then I'm gonna literally do
crashed
good morning everyone it is the day of
the two-faced event but in the morning
and kind of throughout the day we have
free time so me and Emily are heading to
the birdie center to do a bit of
shopping so I'm gonna take you along
with me
we're lost
for you
so I am back in my room now slurring
blog as much as I want to see while we
were out and about shopping it was only
because they get I really should have
talked about this shopping malls and
shopping centers they get a bit funny if
they see people filming I don't know why
they normally tell you to stop
but I thought I would show you some of
the bits that I got so naturally I went
to a bath and Bodyworks
and I got three of their scents I got
the sugarplum swirl that went to wonder
berry and then the a thousand wishes but
it's the diamond shimmer miss I'm
obsessed with that scent and this is
kind it's it smells like the scent but
it has glitter in it so it's really good
for like all over your body and then I
got three candles I'm not gonna open
them because then I just have to wrap
them back up and release key anybody got
time for that and I got the peppermint
it's called like the peppermint candy
one or something but it really doesn't
smell like peppermint at all so it's
really nice and sweet and then I got
this other one that Emily recommended
that kind of smells like that boy scent
you know like the Lynx he kind of spray
so I got three of them and like the mini
ones then I went to like CVS and I just
got a couple little bits I've got some
L'Oreal True Match and one of the colors
that I don't think we do in the UK and
it's like in the old bottle this one is
in caramel beige and then I got my favor
I per guys know this and I got the
double pack of course then I went to
Victoria's Secret because the Victoria's
Secret Rose just happened and really I
was feeling like getting some new
festive under a saccade some red ones
these are made of like a velvet how cute
as a and then I got like a matching set
and then this is one of my favorite
scents as well
it's the intense fragrance I already
have like the big bottle so I thought
I'd get these two for when I'm going out
and stuff and I don't wanna bring that
big bottle and they fit perfectly in
bags then I went to Sephora and I got a
new anastasia dipbrow this one's and the
kind of soft brown so I thought I'd
tried that out and I got the brush that
goes with it a little travel-size at the
NARS radiant creamy concealer in custard
I finally got the glam glow mask that's
like silver and I'm gonna do that now
before the event tonight and Dan I may
have made a little purchase I got this
bag from Gucci only because I know I
shouldn't really have to like justify
purchases but when you're in America
things are a lot more discount
so and I've always really wanted that
bag and I've been saving up ages and I
forgot to bring a bag for tonight and I
saw that one and I was like you know
what worked hard I will treat myself
yeah I never ever buy things like that
so yeah I wasn't sure they're not to
include or not cuz any people can get
like I know a bit funny and stuff but ya
know I'm just gonna take my makeup off
and begin be getting ready process let's
beat this face so we're all ready to go
into the TV a sweet peach party
somewhere already were just in Emily's
room because my colors didn't work so
luckily she had some to save the day
this is Anne's outfit
give us a twirl Gorge right we're
heading down now
Oh
just go back to our room the party has
finished that was honestly one of the
most incredible parts they'd ever been
to I literally like it I felt like I was
scrolling through my Instagram feed and
then looking around the room and seeing
everyone that was there it was amazing
everyone was so so so lovely and
everyone is basically staying at the
same motel that we're at and the party
is continuing at the sky bar next door
so I'm sure I will love a bit in that if
I can
goodbye rum time to check out caps the
airport and then head off to the UT home
to me
last two
as for you
so I'm not sure where I finished or
whatever but I just know I was
absolutely shattered after that 48 like
the craziest 48 hours ever so I may have
forgotten to kind of like film bits or
like finish the vlog so I hope you don't
mind but that was honestly the two of
the best experiences I've ever had in my
life I can't explain to you at beautycon
with you all coming up to us the meet
and greet and everyone just being so
lovely literally I was telling the girls
I don't know it's just cuz I was tired
but I really just felt like bursting
into tears like it honestly it you'll
never know how much that means to you to
like finally meet it's not even everyone
but just like a portion of the people
that support you it's like a blessing
and honestly I had like the best time
ever and it's because of you guys I got
to go to LA like just for the day like
doing that is like mind-boggling for me
but I had the best time and it's all
