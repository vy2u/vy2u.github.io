today I decided to do a I know what kind
of makeup look this is kind of like a go
to kind of look for me just kind of
experimenting with products and brands
and stuff because all of the brands used
in this makeup tutorial are cruelty free
I found this picture that had like a
list you probably know the one I'm
talking about I had a list of all the
brands that don't test on animals and
they're totally cruelty free and yeah so
I wanted to create a makeup look using
only those brands because I know a lot
of people vegan and a really kind of for
just using brands that are only cruelty
free I know some the big brands a lot of
people use actually might test on
animals so people might feel they can't
achieve the same sort look or they might
just not be aware of some of the brands
that are cruelty free and don't have
some animals so yeah I really hope you
guys enjoy this tutorial and I kind of
created a look that I hope most people
will enjoy it and find wearable and they
can switch up and just do whatever they
want with if that makes any sobs so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did
and you like the look at this makeup
look and let's go ahead and get started
so for this look we're gonna start fresh
face and apply our primer I've been
absolutely loving the Too Faced hangover
ex-prime I think this is and you guys
know I'm obsessed with using my Real
Techniques brush to blend it in and this
brush is also cruelty free along with
Too Faced products so yay two of my
favorite things like I said been loving
this primer and for foundation I felt
like being a bit more full coverage
today and I am using cover effects is
there oil-free foundation and I like to
kind of put two dots on my face and then
spread it out like I said it is quite
full coverage and then this just helps
to share it out and then you think the
Real Techniques expert is it the expert
no that's the brush there miracle
complexion sponge to blend this out
then filling in my eyebrows with my
favorite Anastasia Beverly Hills
products is the dip brow in medium brown
and blonde and for concealer I'm taking
this it's a two-in-one
concealer and contour stick from nude
Stix and I'm just taking the concealer
end and then just placing this
underneath my eyes I've been loving
using concealer pencils recently they
blend it really effortlessly especially
using a sponge as well and like ice and
it also it works as a really good brow
highlight sorry guys I am as so so so
tired my word says features aren't
coming out yeah using as a brow
highlight as well and then blending in
with the same sponge I use with the
foundation this just helps kind of make
sure everything merges together and
because the pencil it can be quite full
coverage this just helps to share it out
as well
once that's all blended out is time to
set in place I'm just taking this Naza
pressed powder just pressing that in
everywhere that I highlighted to make
sure it's locked in place it's not gonna
crease or move and we stay matte all day
I've been really reaching for this
recently is the NYX duo contour and it's
in the shade 2 to tango
I love how olive tone this bronzer is
and obviously it comes with the blush as
well which is a really gorgeous peach
emoji color and I always say I'm not a
massive blusher wearer and this one is
super super subtle as you'll see so the
perfect combination so this is a pretty
handy product to take with you traveling
I keep saying this but I love it using a
cream highlighters before powder ones
and this is the Becca liquid illuminator
in the shade moonstone I just like to
spend some onto the back of my hand and
then it press it onto my cheekbones to
kind of warm it up and blend it in as we
kind of already use powder so you don't
want it to sit cakey on the skin so
using your finger like I said really
warms it up and make sure it blends it
really easily as well for powder
highlighter I'm at taking the anastasia
beverly hills illuminated in so
hollywood i really couldn't find this
anywhere online anymore
so i linked the laura geller gilded
honey highlighter which is such a dupe
for it and laura geller is also cruelty
free so don't you worry with our skin
done is now time to move on to our eyes
i'm at taking the color chickadee from
makeup geek because makeup geek
eyeshadows are cruelty free and don't
test on animals so the majority of the
eyeshadows we are using are from makeup
geek
yeah just taking chickadee which is a
really lovely warm orange it's like my
favorite transition color on a a fluffy
brush and then it's taking the colored
frappe to further deepen up the crease
and as always going back in with our
initial brush I always like to switch up
my brushes to make sure everything is
blended in it together using a
much-loved Coco bear shade again using
this to further deepen up the socket and
add a bit more depth and create that
gradient effect
just keep blending I love to just blend
it as you can tell always switching up
the brushes then I am at taking Sunset
Boulevard from colour-pop because
colour-pop cosmetics is it cruelty free
and this is such a gorgeous shimmery
bronze color and it is part of the kpop
collection so the one that they
collaborated with crown sit then going
back in with one of my fluffy brushes
just making sure everything is blended
seamlessly switching out blending
blending and more blending then I am
taking the shade badda-bing also from
makeup geek just concentrating this on
our lash line on the outer third and
then it taking it up into the crease
still only concentrating it on the outer
third just to make sure that it creates
that kind of smoky effect and I didn't
want it to be too intense either
back in with those brushes again
then I am taking the shade shimma shimma
and then applying that to my brow bone
and inner corner and then just going
ahead and applying mascara I love this
one I haven't used in ages it cosmetics
is called to you for re obviously and
then using it the NYX wonder pencil just
to open and brighten my eye then taking
the shade frappe and running that on my
lower lash line and then just going
ahead and applying a bottom and lash
mascara after that but I did kind of
want my lower lash line to be a bit more
intense I'm going in with Coco bear and
a flat brush and just pressing that
along at my lash line
this makes the NYX pencil really stand
out and make the color of my eyes stand
out as well the lashes I'm using house
of lashes spellbound these use synthetic
hairs so they are also quality free as
well and they are my favorite at the
moment and then I'm just going ahead and
applying a nude lip and I'm using the
Jane Iredale pencil in nude and then
filling it in with this jouer cosmetics
lip cream in the color buff I think it
is I googled it and Julie is cruelty
free as well and then finally you can
either leave it matte or I talked to my
with a gloss and this is the fairy floss
gloss also from colour-pop cosmetics and
yeah it's like my favorite nude
combination at the moment I'm in love
with it it's a really gorgeous pinky
color and I'm obsessed so that's the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this cruelty free tutorial
give it a thumbs up if you did and I
will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
