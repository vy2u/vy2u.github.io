today I thought I would do a kind of
current beauty favorites type video just
because I like sitting down and chatting
with you guys and just letting you know
what kind of my favorite products are at
the moment because I know I love these
types of videos I love finding out what
people are really into and find and like
discovering it new product so this is
mainly Beauty favorites I mean there's
some nail stuff and some hair stuff I
think that kind of all comes under the
same category so to start off with I'm
gonna start off with nails I think I
posted a picture about this on my
Instagram earlier which kind of made me
really think about it is the nails ink
spray on nail polish if you guys saw the
video that I posted on my Instagram
awhile ago this stuff is like I think I
said this like it like dry shampoo of
the nail world it's so easy especially
on holiday like if you can't be bothered
to sit around and wait for your nails to
dry and like before you know you smudge
them I know that's me I can't paint my
own no I can't make my own nails or so
this is like a lifesaver
so I always already demoed it in that
little Instagram video be literally yeah
but apply the base coat spray this on
top I think they do other colors but
this is obviously a nude one you guys
know I'm obsessed with nude nails and
then you just paint the top coat on the
top and then you wash wash your hands I
found it easier to kind of let them soak
for a little while and then just kind of
apply some pressure and wash the excess
off and yeah this stuff is literally
amazing I'll leave links to all the
products down below but you can get this
from Sally's in the UK and the US so I'm
still so obsessed with it so I'll leave
the link to that down below and a try if
you haven't already I think there's
other colors too
next the hair product this is from the
electric hairdressing salon in London
and this is a spray in conditioner now I
don't know if I'm using it right but
what I like to do is I don't need to
wash my hair too often I don't find that
it gets greasy too often but when I feel
like it's a bit dead it needs a bit at
the left but I really can't bother to
shampoo conditioner and all that stuff
I'll just shower and I'll just shampoo
my hair and then when I get out the
shower I will just spray this into my
hair
does exactly the same thing it
conditions your hair like I said it's a
spray conditioner and then I'll go ahead
and either like leave or I'll style it
and my hair still feels just as soft as
when I conditioned it last cuz I don't
think you should really shampoo and
condition your hair like every day
partly that's quite bad for your hair
but if I just feel like it it's a bit
like dirty or something like the shampoo
is what cleans it and the conditioners
what makes it really soft and yeah I'm
not obsessed at this it smells like a
salon as well and I you know that
hairdressing smell like when you leave
and you just had your hair freshly done
that is what this smells like
and I'm obsessed with it and yeah just
use me happening super soft and just
like I spent ages conditioning it in the
shower but it's literally just a spray
in one and then yeah so I feel like the
first two products just show how lazy I
am as a person but I really like this
next up is like a body product this is
from cocoa brown it is the golden of
goddess shimmering it dried body oil for
summer you need this all over your body
face legs everything it is amazing I
literally get like this bottle says
leaves you looking like a golden gloves
glittering golden good-ass it's like my
favorite thing on a night out to just
kind of put on your chest and like deck
Kitaj area I think it looks beautiful
especially if you've got your legs out
as well and you want that kind of
airbrushed shimmery glow to your legs
this is the product to use I went to the
event for this and Joyce Benelli was
there who's obviously the Kardashians
makeup artist and she said she uses this
on Khloe Kardashian all the time so if
you wondered how they get that like body
glow supposedly this is what she does
use and she did a demo there and I'm not
surprised it looked a phenomenal so yeah
the cocoa brown golden goddess body oil
is live at the moment next on to make up
the I am obsessed with these pallets
from Coastal Scents they come in a set
of three or you can buy them
individually I think the whole three set
you get a lot more better value for your
money and I'll see more colors to play
and the storage of them is so cute it's
like a little book but it's their
stylized sets it's three pallets
there's the glamorize one if I show you
the colors mine the mirror like that so
you can see there's a few pops of color
in there some really nice neutrals I'm
obsessed with this a gold color here
then there's the social eyes one so this
one's more for the kind of cool cooler
tone lovers some really gorgeous
shimmery shades and these are so
pigmented as well which is also why I'm
obsessed with them and they're perfect
for travel they're like really like the
smaller than my hand they're perfect and
then this is my favorite one is the
formalise palette it's actually I have
this color on my lid right now if you
saw my snapchat the other day i swatched
I'll swatch it for you again it's like a
gorgeous coppery color and yeah they I
think they've retail for about $12
individually or $25 for all three I will
leave the link to them down below like I
said but they are so creamy and Coastal
Scents is such an affordable a brand so
the pigment that you get for them and
then for the price is like incredible
and I think those kind of three palettes
there's something for everyone there so
if you like a bit of color but nothing
too adventurous and maybe the glamorize
one or if you're more of a neutral
everyday in the formalised one or if you
like I said more into the core sultry
darker tones then the social eyes one
would be perfect for you moving on to
more makes me type of products this is
the one 3:05 brush from Mac excuse mines
bit dirty I've literally just used it
all over my face this I think morphe
might do a dupe of this I'm not sure
that this brush is perfect for bronzer
and just dusting all over your face I
actually use it with one of the products
I'm about to mention in a minute and you
might have seen you use it in a tutorial
but I'm obsessing this brush I only
recently kind of I've had it for ages
but only recently got introduced to kind
of using it more often this literally
just buffs and everything like powders
or highlight to interest skin and it's
just really it seamlessly blends all out
and it's quite thin but it's like got a
big surface area so it's really like I
said really good for blending as a Mac
brush my
they are on the expensive side but
obviously but they're expensive because
that each individually handmade and they
last you like the longest time as long
as you take care of them but like I said
I think that is a multi-chip if that is
I will leave that in the link down below
but I always find the originals always
the best and I'm obsessed with this
brush linking a back to the brush I used
that to dust Mac gold deposit everywhere
like all that mainly on the tops of my
forehead and on my cheeks I've been
obsessing with this at the moment it is
like the most this on top of that golden
goddess body oil mmm daddy's seriously
like I'm obsessed with just looking at
bronzy and Joey and like that kind of
look and also this works for nurses and
eyeshadow as well I used it in my last
tutorial and yeah I am obsessed with
this at the moment I can't put it down I
can't stop using it it especially feel
quite light hand with it it just gets
the most phenomenal glow to the skin yet
if you can already tell I'm obsessed
another highlighting product that I'm
obsessed with at the moment is the
Topshop glow pot in gleam if you follow
Sara Ashcroft or you watch how YouTube
videos and that pommy girl if that rings
a bell for people she uses this all the
time and that was kind of I knew that I
had it in my drawer and then only
recently have started using it again and
it is like my favorite thing ever
especially underneath a powder highlight
it gives a really good base and it's
really quick really easy I tried to link
it in my last video and I couldn't find
it online anywhere so I think it's one
of those products you have to go in
store and find and if you get your hands
on it buy it because I'm scared and
they're discontinuing it if it's not on
their website anymore but it's a really
nice champagne color I've never been um
I'm not normally a massive fan of cream
highlighters but this one blends out so
easy and I find it works best with your
finger as well to kind of warm it up and
make it blend a lot easier so yeah that
is the top shop for glow pot in gleam
and my last two kind of favorite
products are lip products
so for lipsticks I've been obsessed with
the soap &amp;amp; Glory lips
except they came out with these two of
my favorites in particular one of them
is a nude and it's called keep it flesh
and it's a satin and this one is you say
tomato which is also a satin which it's
like a really gorgeous bright coral
color these smell so yummy so this one
is the nude one I don't know if you can
see if it looks like that kind of
reminds me of Mac fleshpot so that one
is the nude one that I've been loving
and then this one is you say tomato and
I've been really into the bright colors
at the moment and this one just calls to
me for this summer I think is gorgeous
and would look stunning just with like a
minimal makeup look this probably would
have looked really nice in the last
tutorial that I did with kind of the
minimal eyes and a bright lip and the
formula of these like I said are so nice
they do mattes and they do kind of more
glossy or ones as well they smell
phenomenal and I was lucky enough to
take over their instagraming and
showcase some of the shades for you guys
yeah I just think they're so affordable
they're so pigmented they smell
phenomenal and their color range they do
one for literally everyone so if you
haven't already head down to local boots
or Superdrug I think there should be in
stock by now and check them out but I
always like with most of the stuff I
will link it down below and last but not
least is a lip gloss this is from
Natasha de Nonna
it is a sandy beige number 20 I ordered
this from a beauty dish which because I
was ordering it some birthday's bits my
friend so I thought I shouldn't bite the
bullet and get on for myself as well
while I'm here this is I've got on my
lips right now the most gorgeous like
soft pink nude lip gloss ever smells
phenomenal as well and just it's so
pigmented and looks gorgeous on top of
obviously like nudes or Pink's or
something the wand as well is what I
really like it's really small really
firm so applies a pretty decent amount
of product and I think it's always with
people that start off as a makeup artist
that then bring out their own makeup
products I think I like the best stuff
that like out there like makeup geek and
other brands like that just book
they know what the people want and this
is like my dream loss so I'm obsessed
with this at the moment I know it's a
bit hard to get ahold of if you're in
the UK but I found the shipping it
wasn't too bad and I paid for it myself
I wasn't Center and so it wasn't too bad
and I don't think the gloss itself was
that expensive either I'm hoping one day
or come to like cult beauty or peachy
Bay or something like that but yeah if
you want to try more American makeup
Beauty lish stocks like everything and
yeah like I said shipping is not too bad
either
which is where I got this from and I
know that she has loads of other
products on there as well so if you want
to try and etosha Giannone products you
should probably check it out there but
nice it's my current Beauty favorites I
really hope you guys enjoyed seeing what
I'm really into at the moment give this
video a thumbs up if you want to see
