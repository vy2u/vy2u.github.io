today I thought I would film my kind of
everyday makeup routine for you I seen a
few requests for this in the comments in
quite a few of my videos and I haven't
done one I think in like a year or
something I'm not sure if I've actually
been done I know I've done a glow tulip
which I do plan to do an update one of
that too but this is kind of like
products and the kind of look that I
like to go for and everyday but I really
can't be bothered to do full glam type
of look that you see a lot here on my
channel so I really hope you guys enjoy
this video obviously like I said this is
my everyday makeup look it's not gonna
be up everyone's Street this might be
people's glam looks for all I know but
for me this is the kind of minimal
everyday makeup that I like to wear so
if you like the look of this makeup look
then please keep watching
so before applying any sort of skin
makeup i always like to prep my skin no
matter I'll do this like every day
without fail just as I find my makeup
never sits the same unless I do so so
for my moisturizer I like to use the own
a two-in-one hydration moisturizer and
just apply that all over my skin so I
really like what this Mel's amazing for
one and I think it has a tiny bit of
like gradual time to it so it adds a bit
of like kind of buckling just getting
you keep using on like a regular basis
then then that's a primer if I just need
something that's gonna be I know it's
like a go-to product for me I'm pretty
sure I mentioned it in my favorites with
my primers like my all-time favorite
primer in like an all time favorite
makeup I might kind of talk so I'm
pretty sure I mentioned this in like my
all-time favorite Beauty kind of video
as one of my favorite prime isn't it is
the L'Oreal the magic primer sometimes I
if I got like more time I move sure I
did like the Mac strobe cream and never
a primer on the top this is kind of like
the two and one effect from that so that
is why I really like this one and kind
of it's like a go-to for everyday
product for me either
I use my hands to apply it or I actually
really like to use a brush you've seen
me in my tutorials using the I think
this is like the multitask face brush I
don't know why I like to use a brush
sometimes I just think just applies a
bit more evenly into the skin but
anything that's going to make me kind of
look glowy or radiant throughout the day
I really like and it's super affordable
too so I don't mind using it like every
day I swear I unlike the worst again
like I gun
I also really gross that my friends
always call me out on it Rachel you're
watching that was a bad one for my skin
I tend to mix up sometimes if I feel
like going glad for the day or something
I'll wear like a full coverage
foundation but if it's kind of more an
everyday basis
I need something quick I tend to go for
like BB creams or like a really
lightweight foundation and at the moment
I'm really really liking the hourglass
skin tint so it's kind of like that BB
cream formula but if you don't have this
one that's two other ones I really like
are the only two in one BB cream hour
the it cosmetics CC cream they both have
a really similar formulas maybe all kind
of more America this one UK this one
they're really similar as well and I
think just as much I really like the
skin tone because as you can see and I
always say like my neck is a lot darker
than my face I definitely need attempt
my skin to be able to make a balance out
in color I just like to buff it into my
skin and this is the BH Cosmetics put a
buffing brush gotta make sure you blend
it down oh my god haha see guys I have
to do this otherwise I just don't match
and I prefer to match obviously soon
I'll see there'll be a video where no
one comments to tell me did you know
that your foundation doesn't match your
skin it might not match the skin of my
face it matches the skin of my neck and
that's all that matters days like this I
wish I had freckles because things like
this you can still see your natural skin
underneath my thing kinda hackles would
just be after my skin makeup I tend to
do my eyebrows and my go-to kind of
products for this especially if I need
to be quick kind of like on an everyday
basis it's a pretty good pencil and a
brow set so today I'm going to be using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow definer
in a soft brown and my Loreal brow
artist plumper
in medium to dark I do have a few
favorite eyebrow pencils I really really
like the makeup the Ehlert's sculpting
pencil and I have this one in the shade
type and then of course you guys know
I'm obsessed with the soap and glory at
brow artery pencil in hot chocolate so I
design of switch-up between these three
but this is definitely my go-to kind of
like browser I definitely plan to do an
updated brow routine really soon just
because I always skip through them in my
tutorials just cuz I feel like everyone
goes their eyebrows differently but I
thought of maybe doing a brow tutorial
could turn one like a brow tutorial for
when you're going out and you want to
make your eyebrows up like extra like
amazing and then a brow ogen everyday
brow tutorial because they're two very
different sets of me I could spend like
45 minutes trying to do my brows before
going out and then on a day-to-day basis
like this like do it like in two minutes
so let me know if you'd want to see that
I like to use a browser just to make
sure like everything's kind of set in
place and just to darken the hair
underneath because as you can see the
color that I used to put them in and
stopping my natural hair so I kind of
want to take them as well make them
appear a bit further we were having your
face this good to the palate smells
under 101 Brown done my bad done I think
I browsing Skinner like two massive
catfish traits of mine speaking of skin
after I do my eyebrows I like to move on
to concealer so my code you can see that
is the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
in the shade like warm just because you
get such a nice coverage with this and I
really like the color but other good two
concealers that I do like to use on on
like a daily basis is the Maybelline age
rewind and the LA girl Pro conceal in
the shade natural both of these provide
the same sort of similar coverage I just
kind of prefer that undertone and
colored this one but I do love these two
also so I always just apply it in like a
upside down triangle
Joanna's brows and like chin I'll always
always use like a damp sponge to blend
out even this one this is the Real
Techniques miracle sponge or the Beauty
Blender if you ever see me using a brush
is because I've already started filming
I forgot to like bring my sponge in so
I'll use a brush instead but yeah I
always love this because it just absorbs
excess product and just blends things so
it's so it's so much easier I feel like
my roots are getting darker and darker
by like second
so I next time I get my head on which is
going to be the 4th of March because I'm
going to sound I'm gonna vlog at the
vise I don't know whether to kind of
embrace it and then kind of go for the
Cathar iaj type thing which is kind of
so that's what I have now at the moment
it's a bit kind of like choppy so I
don't want to kind of embrace the dark
grey for the kibosh effect or to like go
over one kind of
or just go it and go really dark
brown but I always always get tempted
when I see people with red hair I was so
so jealous because I really liked the
look of like really dark hair and really
bright blue eyes but then I think I just
spent so long getting my hair blonde
I just miss it too much I'm also using a
sponge to blend out kind of make sure
everything is kind of as thin on the
face as possible because like I said
these sponges are really good at
absorbing excess product so nothing till
feels too thick or cakey on the face
because sometimes this might be quite a
lot of makeup for someone on their skin
if they might just went into moisturizer
or something like that
so for everyday this kind of makes it a
lot more comfortable I sometimes like I
literally just don't make sense
I just ramble anyway moving on to a
powder
I like at everyday basis I just tend to
use a translucent powder so either like
my Laura Mercier one or I've got one
from NARS as well it's like their
crystal one but I've just picked up the
Rimmel clear complexion that translucent
powder and I just dust that everywhere
also I like to set kind of my eyelid I
like to set my eyelids with powder and
just because like I said I get I'm quite
lazy on like a day today so I don't
really use an eye primer even though
I'll wear like I makeup I generally use
an eye primer so I just like to make
sure that my eyelids are set to stop any
creasing when you move onto the eyes all
set to bronze up my skin bronzer
something that I don't really have a
preference in which one I use I've got
quite a few that I'd really really love
this one I'm obsessive at the moment
though it is the l'oreal glam bronze in
natural this is probably like the
biggest bronzer I own I love it to death
but it's such a positive put in storage
it just has to lay flat in its own
section moving on it to a blusher
recently if you watch my American haul
video I picked up this blusher from
Milani in the shade Dulce pink
actually the obsesses it gives such a
nice kind of tint paint flow to the skin
and if you're from the UK you can get
this from Amazon I've checked in I've
ordered Milani Luminoso for mums and
before or seasons in America or wherever
you can get your hands on this this is
gorgeous but other brushes that I really
like as well are the the Laura Geller
blush in race berry I really like this
one and the bomb Big Momma blusher this
one's kind of like your NARS orgasm it's
got that gold tint running through it
just like the Dolce pink one does but
this one's sort of a bit more darker a
little more kind of bronze goddess he
says depending on how tired I am or kind
of what look I'm feeling I tend to
switch up between these I think even
used to watch my videos you know like is
never ever a blush person look I never
wore blusher and I always told myself I
hated it but recently I'm like obsessed
with it
so if you were like me and you are
scared to try blusher do it and use this
one because it's amazing try to up
moving on it's a highlight recently I
picked up the hourglass strobing powders
this one's in the shade brilliant light
and I am obsessed with performing of
these if you guys get the chance to get
your hands on them definitely this one
or the euphoric light one they give such
a gorgeous glow to the skin like I said
there's their they're called strobing
powders they're not called highlighters
and I can definitely tell the difference
in formula these go on a lot creamier
and regular kind of powder highlight
just and give you definitely more of a
strobing finish to the skin which is a
lot more natural but I have a
highlighter that I do really really like
that are the same sort of color are the
mary lou manizer by the balm and this
one from peaches makeup and this is
called and this is a strobing powder in
the shade halo then the formula of this
one is really really similar to the
hourglass but color wise mary lou
manizer sings so I kind of like to
switch it up oh boy is highlight every
day and that's it for the skinny so for
some people that might be quite like a
lot of makeup but like ice
Nazi by the title this is kind of like
my everyday everyday makeup so for me
that's not really a lot compared to what
you're probably used to seeing on my
channel and it's just what makes me feel
comfortable on a day to day basis moving
on to eye makeup now I makeup is
something that I change up all the time
if you guys know me and like you guys
know I love clown makeup so might
technically like everyday makeup routine
probably would involve my wing and
lashes but all the time there are days I
like to really really minimal but this
type of little makeup name might be your
like clown makeup so I this kind of
appeals to everyone and there's like a
balance and no one's going to be like
it's too much or whatever because whole
point of makeup and everyone is
different so the whole point is to be
diverse and have fun well it makes you
feel comfortable I always feel like I
have to justify myself but yeah so like
I said for every day I'm normally really
comment bothered to an eye base but I
just tend to grab a palette that I know
has a couple of crease colors in it I
really like so for today I've got the
Too Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm
probably gonna be using these two kind
of colors they're like light soft brown
ones I like texture from Mac as in
everyday eyeshadow as well or at the
morphe 35o palette those kind of warm
colors I'll take like one or two from
them and then something really light and
shimmery champagne on the lid so today
I'm going to be using the l'oreal
infallible eyeshadow in iced latte so if
you watched my haul video you'll see
that you'll have seen a swatch of this
already so you know what kind of shade
it is if you don't want to kind of use
those of different products and this is
gonna make a really nice I show as well
yeah so that's kind of what I'd wear I
like an everyday based on the eyes so
something like and shimmery on the lid
and then something really soft in the
grease I feel like I just rambled for so
long about bloody eye
company or people like to run an
everyday basis you just do you just
something that's gonna make me look a
bit more awake and alive ready for this
day is my everyday look then like I said
just taking this warm brown shaking the
chocolate about to face Palace Palace
palette on a fluffy Sigler brush with
this palette smells so good and then
just puffing that into my socket then
I'm going to take that same light brown
eyeshadow and just run it under my eye
just because I really like to but I
should have under my eye just cuz I feel
like it completes the kind of eye look
and makes my eyes appear brighter you
don't have to do this but it's just a
thing I like to do no matter what then I
think I'm just going to take a tiny tiny
dab of the darker brown eyeshadow and
just use that to give my eyes just a bit
more depth
like that so this is what the eyes kind
of look like with nothing on still
brooding minimal in my eyes but of the
see it's totally up to you you could
wear less wear more do whatever you want
and normally you guys made me how much I
love lashes so anyone how I feel I would
normally maybe apply some natural lashes
but for today I really can't develop so
what I like to do is curl my eyelashes
using the half lash curlers from Mac
because my eyelashes are really short
which is why I do like to wear false
eyelashes so after I call them I like to
make sure I know I'm not gonna wear
lashes I am wearing a really of all
luminous mascara that I'm gonna go in
with the Mac X know the Mac in extreme
dimension discards afterwards this is a
pretty pretty good mascara kind of like
sweet volume and drama so if you kind of
like the look of false lashes and that
kind of volume this is a pretty good
mascara especially if you culture rushes
to look to finish off my look I normally
like to up see apply over to apply
something to my lips so might kind of to
kind of go to the products is a lipstick
and a lip gloss
I don't really turn to apply a pencil
kind of everyday unless I'm kind of got
the time or whatever so I'm going to be
using this lipstick from a fight Beauty
this is in the shade rep Xena I think
which is basically just a really soft
pink shade and then the gloss on top I'm
going to be wearing is nas sweet dreams
I remember I bought this lipstick ages
ago because I watched one of money
anyways favorite videos and then it's
just been in my drawer and only recently
I kind of switched in outside and
whether this is actually such a nice
color I've totally forgot I had it so if
you guys get the chance I think on I got
mine from Sephora so it's such a nice
kind of color and then put the gloss on
top this one's like a nice soft paint
but it's got a gold running through its
own makes you look extra sparkly
so that is it I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial let me know if you
guys prefer kind of more chatty talk
through tutorials rather than voiceovers
because I do do them from time to time
voiceovers just a bit easy for me when
explaining what I'm doing but if you
guys prefer these types of videos let me
know obviously this is just my everyday
makeup you guys could just watch a long
while you're doing your kind of everyday
makeup and maybe this gives you a few
different product ideas or what have you
but yes make sure you're following me on
Instagram Twitter and snapchat I'll
leave that all kind of here but yeah
until the next video I will see you soon
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
