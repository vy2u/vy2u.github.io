I've already started with my eyes
prepped and my brows done all products
will be listed in the description below
and then using this eyeshadow from Mac
called soft brown and using an angled
brush to start off creating the cut
crease I'm using a light color to start
with just in case I make any mistakes it
makes it a lot easier for me to tidy it
up then taking this warm shade from at
this Belfiore palette I think it's
called toffee I'm just working upwards
from the cut crease I created with a
fluffy brush blending out but making
sure I can still see that line just so I
know not to go over it and always making
sure to blend on every step next up I'm
taking this red shade from the same
palette I've created and this one's in
the shade crimson on this pointed Sigma
blending brush I'm just using it to
further deepen up the cut crease and
create that gradient effect
taking another Belfiore I shadowed this
once in the shade spice it's essentially
just a warmer deep brown shade I'm using
this to really cut out the crease and
then like I said going back in with a
blending brush with one of the other
colors and I think I dabbed it in a bit
of the crimson color again just to make
sure I could really blend it out easily
for my lid shade I wanted some immediate
glittery and light so I'm mixing these
two pigments together one is we need
cosmetics in the shade liquid mirror and
the other one is from bellapierre
cosmetics and the shade of snowflake so
as you can see it just creates this
really a nice light gold color and then
on the top using my Mac mixing medium as
an adhesive I am pressing on Mac's
reflex gold for that extra glitter if
you guys haven't tried any of the matte
reflex pieces yet definitely should
either party season they are when
favorite thing ever to complete any eye
look but here I'm just going back in
with that spice shade just to further
define the crease and then going in with
a fluffy brush to soften out the edges
and then taking carbon from Mac which is
just obviously a black eyeshadow you can
use whatever you want and then just like
I said further deepening the crease to
give it that sharp edge then I am taking
a wipe and this is when it all comes
together I'm just creating that wing and
you can really see the cut crease here
and then I'm going ahead and highlight
in my inner corner and my brow bone just
with a matte creamy white eyeshadow you
can use whatever you want I'm not sure
what I used here then I'm gonna go ahead
and do my liquid liner using my NYC
liquid liner and I also applied mascara
off-camera I'm then just going black
black back in with the black eye shadow
just on the outer corner and applying
these lashes from ardell in the number
one one eight now on to skin I am
priming my skin using my smashbox
hydrating primer and just like always
massaging that into my skin i'm Zdenek
going ahead and applying foundation and
today I'm using the Giorgio Armani
foundation in the shade
6.5 which I know you're probably gonna
tell me is too dark but I promise you it
matches the color of my neck
need to say it any more times then using
my Urban Decay Naked skin concealer in
the shade light warm under my eyes just
obviously in the usual place that I
normally do and just blending that out
with a damp Beauty Blender and then
setting that all in place with my
hourglass in infusion powder this
honestly I've become obsessed with again
I know I've used it quite a few times
recently anyway but it's honestly the
most amazing under-eye powder it just
looks so nice within pictures and stuff
like that and it's called diffused light
and it literally does look like the
lights diffused on your skin like it
honestly looks so beautiful if you're a
bride or anything like that I definitely
recommend this powder then I am warming
up my skin with my Mac mineralized
skinfinish in the shade comfort this one
is limited edition but any of the
permanent ones that they have in the
shade like dark golden or give me some
or something like that work just as well
and I love them just the same then going
back to the eyes I then take my Too
Faced glitter glue and just run it along
my lower lash line and press this
glitter onto it this is Mac reflex
blackened red and I just thought it kind
of added to the Christmas Festival then
for blush I'm using my makeup geek honey
moon blusher and just applying this kind
of quite far back but all of my cheeks
and then I'm highlighting my cheeks with
my Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighter
in the shade starlight just on this Mac
2 to 4 brush for that kind of extra
precision and then I'm also applying it
obviously on my Cupid's bow as well then
for lips I'm taking this lipstick from a
trust from trust issues from Anastasia
Beverly Hills called trust issues and
then applying this la girls lip glaze on
the top I didn't really have a name but
it's like the red one I'm not sure if
there's loads of different shades of red
but it was just a nice burgundy to tie
in with underneath the eyes and that is
the finished look I really hope you guys
