hey guys welcome back to my channel so
I've started off with my eyebrows done
products will be listed down below and I
promise an updated browser toriel is
coming soon then I'm just prepping my
eyes using a flesh toned eye base and
then placing tape down at an angle I
find it easier when I'm doing a cut
crease to use tape then using the Naked
palette from Urban Decay taking the
color buck on a flat shader brush as
using a flat shader brush more like a
flat definer brush and using this to
really carve out my crease I find it
easier to be looking down into a mirror
to do this so you can really see where
your crease is and really carve it out
also when I said I used a flesh tone
base that's going to be important for
the future step so use whatever you want
for that but then I'm just taking quite
a defined fluffy brush and the color
naked from The Naked 1 palette and using
that to really softly blend it out and
then we're just going to kind of repeat
these two steps to get the kind of
desired look that I am after as you can
see I'm kind of using a dragging motion
as well with that but color just to
bring it up because I am going to
further define the crease with another
color and then just like I said before
going in with a fluffy brush again and
just softly blending out all the edges
using the same definer brush I'm taking
the color Hustler and again placing it
where we placed buck initially just to
kind of create the cut crease and define
the socket even further
again using that dragging motion to
bring the color up slightly and then
blending it out taking a really defined
fluffy brush I'm going back in with the
butt color again the kind of trick to
cut creases and any smokey eye is just a
blend blend blend so going back in with
all the colors that you've already used
and just going back over the steps
you've done but this brush just allows
me to get really deep into the socket so
we've still got that cut crease we don't
want to blend out too much so much so
that you can't see the cut crease
anymore so I am going back in with that
definer brush and The Hustler shade to
build up the intensity at that I want
going back in with the nude eye base
that we use earlier and a small
concealer brush this is why I said it
was important to use like a flesh tone
color so you're not going to be adding
any color onto the lid but I am using it
to kind of define the crease even
further so as you can see just taking a
small concealer brush and just going all
over what I'm going to be placing the
lid color and going right up to the
crease to really define it
the lid color I kind of went to mix up
so I'm mixing sidecar and half baked I
feel like most naked one at urban decay
tutorials always use half-baked I kind
of wanted some sort of more muted gold
color so I wanted to mix them both
together and I'm just taking a flat of
definer brush shader brush and just
placing that all over where we just
placed the eye base and the eye base
does help as a bit of an adhesive and
really kind of intensifies the shadow
then going back in with that hustla
color on the smaller fluffy definer
crease brush oh such a long word and
then like I said it just going back in
and further defining the socket then you
want to go ahead and highlight your
inner corner and this is the shade
version from the same palette obviously
which is a really gorgeous shimmery
pearl color and I'm just placing that in
my inner corner with a small pencil
brush now this is an extra step I did
want to add a bit of glitter so I'm
taking some liquid eye primer which I'm
pressing on it to my lid with my finger
and Mac reflex gold which I'm just
pressing on top of that with a small
fluffy flat brush this just kind of
completes looked me I thought it was
just missing a little bit of extra
sparkle and yes so you don't have to add
this in subsea it's not involving the
palette but I thought it was a nice
finishing touch
now onto eyeliner you can keep the tape
there if you need the extra guidance but
I am going to show you how I do it
without as you can see I'm using the
Sigma neck line a liquid liner and I'm
just going to start my inner corner and
I just draw one line I think the keys
and liquid eye line is lots of little
strokes not like one massive one and I'm
just using that to kind of create the
width that I want across the lid again
like I said using lots of little strokes
that way it minimizes mistakes so that's
the kind of thickness I was going talk
about obviously I still wanted to be
able to see the lid and the sparkles and
stuff like that and just tidying up
slightly then as we have got the base
from the tape I'm using that as a guide
obviously like I said you can keep the
tape there before if you struggle with
your wings but I'm just using that like
I said as a base and then drawing it
back in connecting it with the lid liner
that we've just done that's why I find
it easier to do that first
I'm literally ramming it so hard to
describe how to do a liquid liner so I
thought I would include it and show you
once that done you'll want to go ahead
and apply mascara and this is the one
from Make Up For Ever it's amazing and
this look look really nice with just
mascara but obviously it's me and I am
gonna apply falsies these my favorite
ones from below they're what the fluffs
I do have a discount code it is down
below if you're interested I just
thought it would complete the look at
they're not too intense and they're
winged and beautiful I did skip through
the skin but I have left all the
products down below because I'm obsessed
with the skin look it's just because I
have a couple of skin tutorials coming
up to finish off the eyes I am taking
this a zoeva graphic eyes pencil in the
shade mute which was like a soft gray
which reminded me of the dark side all
the the kind of darkest color that we
used from the palette and I didn't want
to do black because I didn't want to
kind of steal any focus or make it too
intense but then I'm just taking a
pencil brush and the shade up and just
using that to buff out the liner and
smoke out the lower lash line
finally to complete the I look I am just
applying mascara to of my bottom lashes
and then yeah that is the completed
Euler I am obsessed with these eyes I
think it's such a classic smokey eye so
I really hope you guys enjoyed the
tutorial on the eyes now moving on to
the lips I did skip through this bit as
well just because it was mainly an eye
tutorial but I used the Too Faced
perfect nude liner and the OCC metallic
lip tar in Hollywood and that is the
finished look like I said I really hope
you guys enjoyed it give it a thumbs up
if you did if you do recreate it let me
know and I'll see you in Thursday's
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
