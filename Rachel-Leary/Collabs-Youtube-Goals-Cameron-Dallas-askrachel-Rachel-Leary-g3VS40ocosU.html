today I'm gonna be filming a question
arts video don't lot of makeup tutorials
recently so I kind of wanted to do a
different kind of video for you guys
because Phil these are the kind of
videos where you get to know me a bit
better and you guys get to ask me the
question so you want to know so I asked
you guys to ask me on Twitter a bunch of
questions so I'm just gonna start from
the first and go through excuse my voice
by the way it's going Slightly I just
got back from a festival but yeah so
let's get started at wonder and dream
asked who inspired you to become a
makeup artist I probably just like
following people on Instagram and like
watch other youtubers and stuff like
that I can't really put or like think of
anyone specifically that inspired me but
just watching people do it and like just
thinking to myself like I really want to
learn how to do that and like I want to
create this kind of stuff of people like
I don't know there's no one specifically
but just other people doing the same
thing that I'm doing I don't know that's
like the worst answer ever but there's
no one specifically but just looking at
other people and their work that they
can like the skill and stuff like that
I'm just thinking that is what I want to
do what's your favorite type of music
and I'm so like open when it comes to
music choice like I love listening to
other people's music like if I was in a
car with someone or like someone's
bought their iPod or something like I'm
so open to just listening to what they
want to listen to you and I don't really
know genre I think it's called
contemporary R&amp;amp;B it's people like the
weekend polish next door like I'm pretty
sure I born at albums when I just looked
and it said like it was contemporary on
me I like that one the most probably
Katy Bergen at Katy beggin asks what are
your plans for the future
any college bands I was gonna go to
college this year but then I decided not
to I thought taking a year out to work
and do this would kind of be more
beneficial
to see where it goes I'm not expecting
anything I just I feel like working
doing this I going to a college I've
already got a job in the industry that I
wanted to be in like I feel like it was
an unnecessary step but it's like it's
not too late like if I decided when I go
next year like I'm still young enough to
go so I've not brought out completely
but as for now I'm taking a year out
doing this and working Shana Carlson 14
says cat or dog person definitely a dog
person I'm allergic
I'm allergic to both of them but
definitely a dog person she can see
Emily Larson M says your favorite / top
5 makeup geek eyeshadows absolutely
enjoy your videos thank you and probably
get them oneself they're all kind of
separated at the moment ah chicken
images like this which is like a really
nice orange shade fit in which is like a
deep plum maroon shade I love that like
a replacement for brown anything it's it
just adds something different to an eye
look
creme brulee is another one this is just
like a really nice soft brown transition
shade I felt like everyone could wear
this color it's just goes with
everything any eye look just really
softens up the crease like it's like
gonna a razor shade almost like to
really help both our other colors too of
that foiled eyeshadows starry-eyed
grandstand
I've always reached for those two
shimmery shades when like I don't really
know what to put on my lid like I feel
like they just go with everything so
yeah they are my top 5 makeup geek
eyeshadows Rita Mendes 95 says what's
your favorite makeup product that's a
good question I I don't be boring and
say like a bronzer or something if I'd
have to be honest like my favorite
makeup products probably there's
something I
got the most up because that would make
the most sense like I've got so much of
it so therefore it's obviously my
favorite so more really is a nude lip
gloss I have so many and I they're like
all the same shade and I can't seem to
stop buying them so I'm guessing that or
maybe like a face face tanner
I love having a table face I feel like
you don't need to wear like any other
makeup if you've got like a nice
sunkissed bit warmth in the skin I feel
like that's a good product to select a
cream bronzer or something
close to 800 799 says best advice you'd
give someone wanting to start a channel
just do it like honesty do it for you
and nobody else don't go into it
thinking you're going in for those
reasons like personally I don't think
you'll get very very far with it because
you're not doing it because you enjoy it
so I just say just do it be true to who
you are the whole time that you're doing
it because people can really tell if
you're not being yourself and you're
trying to be this person that you're not
I know that everyone sets up be yourself
do it for the right reasons and don't
give up with it if you're not getting
anywhere well if you're not going where
you want to be as fast as you thought it
would be kind of thing like you thought
it was going to come quickly like don't
give up like you have no idea what might
happen the next day so just keep going
and don't listen to people if they try
and that you dancers I know what that
feels like and you just have to power
through and keep going
oh I'm sorry forget this one I think
it's gracious Jackson 58 says what is
your beauty inspiration and would I
visit Mexico which inspiration probably
just watching other people's videos or
like I follow loads of makeup pages on
tumblr I have a tumblr by the way it's
like linked on my youtube channel which
I go on sometimes but a lot of pages I
put on there I kind of used that just
for makeup inspiration because there's
loads of blogs that do really nice
pictures
stuff and yeah inspiration with that or
like other instagrams and stuff like
that when I visit Mexico yeah definitely
I don't really me and my family always
tend to go to like Europe and stuff like
that like Portugal we don't really
venture far up just because that's a
good come from a place for us like we
know we like I know exactly what we're
gonna get when we go there then I
definitely aren't go to Mexico rape
g-loads there says if you could be a
makeup artist for any celebrity here
would you choose
maybe like Jennifer Lopez I feel like
she's got such an easy face today
she's like flawless someone like that
somebody's got a covering easy face to
do just because and there'd be less
pressure
Dana underscore McCrea sorry I get that
wrong do you see yourself ever doing a
collab with another brand love you by
the way come to Sydney all of you to
come to Sydney yeah I've got family in
Sydney and my friends going travelling
to Australia in like a theory or
something and I'm gonna go join them up
there so I should be coming to Sydney do
I see myself collabing with another
brand do you mean like I'm assuming you
mean like bringing out a product with a
brand that's like that aim for me like
if I could achieve anything from doing
this it would be to have my own product
somewhere whether it be a super drug
abuse or just like with a different look
with an American brand or something like
I would love to do that one day
Anika under school Lang oh one says when
did you start doing makeup I posted my
first ever YouTube video on the 31st of
October 2014
so just under a year ago so I guess
that's when I started doing makeup on
here when I started wearing makeup I
used to wear makeup when I was really
young but it would only be like lip
gloss kind of thing it would like a lip
balm or something sell xcv says favorite
shops Topshop hmm I do love my shopping
online so a source probably where I get
the majority of my stuff from Rosanna XO
says what your favorite tea
TV shows or movies TV show I just
finished watching Pretty Little Liars
and that was so good I used to be into
Vampire Diaries I will always love
friends I don't really watch TV anymore
I did it was like anything that was on
e4 so like scrubs How I Met Your Mother
that kind of stuff Saba as an underscore
says what are your top five makeup
products of all time or at the moment
I'll do that at the moment one because I
feel all timeless like a big one I have
no idea at the moment it's probably the
Makeup Forever HD foundation NYX soft
matte lip cream in Cairo
I always leather Becca shimmering skin
perfecter in topaz eye Lily lashes in
Doha I am in love with them the Jordana
Rourke and Rose lip liner I love them
Bonnie Hart 16 says favorite Mac put up
I love you so much
I love you too favorite Mac product like
all of their nude lip liners are all the
time so like oh well stripped down like
any of them or soft and gentle
highlighter give me some bronzer fix but
I'll get fix plus I go and say fix plus
looser ass are you going to do any
meetups and would you ever consider
getting a tattoo meetups not anytime
soon just because I don't really think
anyone would come I don't feel well I
dunno I don't really think of people
that wanting to meet me or see me like I
do see a few people like when out and
about sometimes but it's quite brass so
I wouldn't feel like anyone would want
to come you guys gonna be no but yeah
and what I'll consider getting a tattoo
yeah I'd consider it but I'm so
indecisive I changed my mind about
things all the time so I feel like I'd
get one another week later I'd be like
take often like it so in that something
would have to happen or I'd have to find
something that I really liked for me to
get a tattoo SMG Chanel's channels one
of them says a favorite song at the
moment
any of them basically seventeen oh wait
17th turned black says if you could beat
anyone in the world for one day who
would you be no it sounds cliche but
Kylie Jenner I love her too much else
Mel's underscore said you could
collaborate with any youtuber who would
it be
I would probably say obviously this
one's that like I like love so much I'd
love to cover it with my vote they'd be
like such a weird collaboration Perkins
for instance like I'd cooperate with her
because like I love her so much
I feel like we're kind of two different
so if I had to pick someone to
collaborate with I thought would be like
a realistic I think sense it makes
someone like my own age so I can relate
to the people that I follow like that I
like Cartier Milan she's an australian
youtuber that she's just so cold so I
hate the word indie but so Indian cool
and relaxed and chill and like her
videos are so unpredictable does that
make sense his makeup and stuff and then
there's more of like the real life stuff
like I feel like she's a real life
yuichi been chilled she's not scared to
show you like the stuff that she gets up
writing that's so cool that's something
that I would probably love to do more in
the future but right now I'm more into
like the makeup and stuff yeah either
her shiny grinning she's Australian
aside I subscribed to so many Australian
people I just I used to live in
Australia so I thought connection
allness but I'm Johnny Grauman's my age
too so I feel like that would be kind of
cool she's so funny I follow her on
snapchat and just mental she cracks me
up so much those two Dani months 30 as
well she's so cool she's so sweet like
all of them just seems so nice so
literally anyone that's kind of like
similar age to me I would be dumb to
come up with new also ask can you sing a
song for us or at least about know maybe
one day but no not at this place now
Gabriele Borgia one says what's your
favorite scent anything that's really
sweet
I love so that's like the pink Britney
Spears if you know what that smells like
Jimmy Choo blossom at the moment I just
got a lot of body sprays so Victoria
Secret ones like the mango one that one
is I've got one over there that's like
sensual blush if you know what they
smell like so root sweet smells carriage
ass ass and give East sorry not only
have you been on YouTube just under you
velvet
zoella says what do you want out of
youtube you know I didn't go into it
thinking that it would get as I'd get as
far as I have already so it's so hard to
think like what I want our looks I
didn't go into it wanting anything
really other than to just sort people
and show them how to it like do makeup
and share looks I like kind of stuff so
yes that aim dream would be to come out
with my own product I guess like to use
this as a platform for that kind of
thing
I thought that would be like that to me
at the moment that's completely
unthinkable never gonna happen but I
suppose that's the end goal and when is
that ever was to happen then I don't
even know Brooke Jordan 23 said what
inspired you to start YouTube and what
keeps you inspired I kind of answered
their what inspired me to start YouTube
one earlier just like will see other
youtubers pictures and just like wanting
to share the stuff that I can do with
people and what keeps you inspired you
guys like just like the comments I get
my family do as well just how far like

a short time keeps me inspired it's so
