today I'm starting off with some scotch
tape to make things a bit easier for
myself haven't done this in a really
long time but you can just use a wipe
like I normally do by just thought I
would used to take today then I'm going
in with Mac soft ochre Pro Longwear
Paint Pot to make sure any eyeshadow
that I put on the top doesn't crease and
just kind of gives my eyelid all one
color so the color pigments really come
out stronger then using the zoo Avon
taupe palette and using the soft brown
shade as my initial transition color
this is quite a cool toned look they're
just something quite different for me
you guys know how much I love my warm
tones so just buffing that into the
socket then taking the slightly darker
gray tone and again using that to
further deepen the crease then I'm just
going back in with the initial fluffy
brush that we used to apply the soft
brown shade just to smooth everything
out and make sure there's no harsh edges
then it going in with this again a
slightly deeper shade you guys know the
drill just to create that gradient and
just further deepen up the sucker
taking this shimmery white shade from
the shape shame palettes a matte palette
I'm just applying that all over my lid
now for the glitter I'm using a Mac
reflex pearl which is one of my favorite
glitters of all the time I'm just
spraying my eye with some fix+
and then pressing the glitter on the top
the fix+ kind of adds as a adhesive so
it helps the glitter today
then I'm just taking corrupt from makeup
geek but you can use any matte black
eyeshadow and an angled brush I really
recommend using an angled brush for this
it will make things so much easier for
yourself and also this is why the tape
was really helpful so you can use that
as a guide I'm just applying the black
eyeshadow as if I would apply winged
liner as you can see what I'm doing
there it's just gonna make it a lot
softer a lot easier to blend and it's
not as harsh as like a liquid or a gel
liner which i think is really nice for
this look and I think it's quite
on-trend the most seen a lot of smoky
wings and I'm just taking this pencil
brush and dragging the black shade up
into the socket to make it blend a bit
easier and almost create a softer cut
crease and taking a fluffy brush to
blend it all out
then going back in with that angled
brush and applying a bit more of the
corrupt shadow just to really define it
the liner
now it's time to remove the tape and
reveal the amazingly straight edge
you've created for yourself but like I
said you could have use a wipe to
achieve that as well and then I am just
applying mascara this is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara but it's
applying a light coat so I am gonna be
applying some false lashes and I'm just
using a wipe author to clean up any
fallouts and lashes I'm using I'll leave
in the description bar below but they
are from veneer and you can use the code
way to layer for 15% off they are my
favorite lashes if you saw my snapchat
you know what they look like and they
are amazing and then onto my skin I've
recently just did a foundation routine
so I will link that down below because
nothing's different there but now to
finish off the eyes I'm taking this
concealer pencil from me prismatic sand
just running that in the waterline and
then it taken great from the Saints away
the palette and just buffing that on at
my lower lash line just to add a bit of
depth to the look then applying bottom
lash mascara this is my Mac extended
play this is my all-time favorite
mascara especially supporting lashes
because I've got really short ones this
one really helps to lengthen them define
them and then just applying this dazzle
glass from that and just highlighting my
Cupid's bow just to add a bit more
definition to my lips and that is it but
I really hope you guys enjoyed this look

for next week's is gonna be pre
recording a few as I am going on a
holiday get this video a thumbs up if
