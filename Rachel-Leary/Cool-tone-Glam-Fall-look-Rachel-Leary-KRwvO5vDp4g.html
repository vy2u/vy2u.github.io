today I'm doing this cool tone kind of
glam smokey eye look with Greg running
through the eyes and the lip so if you
like the look of this makeup then please
keep watching
so prior to filming I've already filled
in my brows using the medium brown
anastasia brow wiz then i'm prepping my
eyes the painterly paint-pot by Mac and
going in with latte from makeup geek as
the initial transition shade
then using Swiss chocolate by Mac to
further deepen the crease on a smaller
fluffy brush
then using deep damson by Mac which is a
Promax shade you can get online or in
any pro store I'm using a flat brush to
almost cut my crease and take it onto
the lid as well
as a base for our lid shade I'm taking
this pencil by Neve cosmetics in the
shade rose and just running that all
over my lid with the base down I'm
applying this makeup geek foiled shadow
in the shade Wims cool which is this
gorgeous silvery lilac shade and just
pressing that on the top then going back
in with the flat brush from before not
with any extra product on and just
softening the transition
to create that kind of gradient effect
on going in with bitten from makeup geek
as well and just really lightly pressing
that between the two shades then taking
a wipe and cleaning up the edges as per
usual you could have used tape or
anything like that before this this is
just the method I prefer to use then
using my trusty NYC liquid liner I'm a
creating the winged liner I have a
tutorial on that down below in the
description as per usual then I'm going
in with it cosmetics mascara on my top
lashes and just applying a really thin
coat because I am gonna be applying
false eyelashes then going in with a
matte black eyeshadow this is carbon
from Mac I decided that I wanted to
almost cut my crease that a little bit
further so I'm going in with an angled
brush and really softly blending that up
into the socket using a brush like this
with an angle makes creating cut creases
so much easier and once you've done it
you can just go in with a fluffier brush
and just blend out so it's not so harsh
the lashes I'm using today are from
backstage lashes in the style Vegas
next onto skin I'm gonna kind of skip
through this part because I plan to do a
full coverage foundation routine and
also maybe a cream contour and
highlighting routine depending on which
one you guys want to see more let me
know in the comments below as you saw I
used the L'Oreal Lumi magic primer and
then the Make Up For Ever HD no Ultra HD
foundation stick in the shade 127 the
Anastasia Beverly Hills concealer in the
shade 1.5 and a really darker shade of
the Ultra HD foundation stick as a
contour and then setting my highlight in
place with the diffused light ambient
lighting powder from hourglass then
moving back onto the eyes using Swiss
chocolate again on a pencil brush and
just blending that on my lower lash line
and then going back in with the same
angled brush as before that we used to
use the cut crease and using deep damson
just to kind of press against my lash
line
brighten and make my eyes appear more
open I'm using the sleek liner in the
shade of white noise in my little water
line
as always using my Mac extended play
mascara to apply a coat of mascara to my
lower lashes
and these are the finished eyes then
back to the skin I'm using the
Maybelline master sculpt Geo I think
this is the lighter one out of the two
that they've come out with just to set
the cream contour in place and add a bit
more definition to my cheeks and
forehead to highlight I'm using the
baked swell illuminator from Laura
Geller and the shade gilded honey if
you're from the UK like me you can get
this on cult beauty or Beauty Bay
you would the cool theme onto the lips
I'm taking stone
lip liner from Mac and Anastasia Beverly
Hills liquid lipstick in the shade here
you could just leave it there but I
decided I wanted to add a bit of a
lighter shade in the center of my lips
so I'm going in with the jeffree star
liquid lipstick in the say - Liberty
skipper celebrity skin which I got from
cocktail cosmetics top coat at UK and
this is the finished look I really hope
