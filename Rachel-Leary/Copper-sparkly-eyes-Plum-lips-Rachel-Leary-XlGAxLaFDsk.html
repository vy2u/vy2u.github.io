today I'm gonna be starting off with my
face I'm gonna skip through this bye I'm
using quite a few different products
I'm moisturizing with my Embry Elise
cream and then using this Oprah
cosmetics face primer and then using the
Revlon Colorstay foundation for
concealer I'm taking three products or
so you don't have to this is something
new from soap &amp;amp; Glory it's their new
brightening concealer and then I'm going
over the top with the amazing cosmetics
concealer and then brightening up with
my pregnant prime pen from Mac in the
shade light boost so as you can see it
this concealer from so Pedro has more of
a purple shade and that really helps to
color correct and brighten and putting
that on the top of my foundation and
then facing my amazing cosmetics
concealer on top of that to kind of
cancel out the purpleness and it'd be
more of a flesh tone but the purple
underneath its gonna do the brightening
for me and then I am blending that all
out with a real techniques sponge and
the soap &amp;amp; Glory concealer is coming out
at the end of February today excited
they're coming out with a few more face
products as well and then just adding
extra brightness with my Mac prep and
wine pen in light base
- cream contour I am taking this la girl
Pro conceal in the shade beautiful
bronze and just placed on that around
all the places that I would normally
contour I think I'm gonna do an updated
foundation and kind of highlighting and
contouring routines so let me know in
the comments below if you'd like to see
that and I'll go into all the steps that
I do in a bit more detail instead of
fast-forwarding like this because I love
you guys ask questions on it so I'm
happy to do another video again I feel
like I'm teasing you guys here because
this is another new product from soap &amp;amp;
Glory that's coming out very soon it's a
kind of highlighting stick this one's in
the shade ice shimmer I think it's the
painless one and it's basically your
classic pearlized shimmering shade and
it is the most gorgeous cream highlight
and just blending that in with a real
techniques multitask brush and it just
blends so nicely into the skin I am so
so so excited for you guys to be able to
get your hands on these soon then I'm
setting my face with my Mac Studio Fix
powder in the shade NC 30 and kind of
setting the cream contour with my Tom
Ford gold dust bronzer
to intensify and kind of set the
highlighter I'm taking this NARS dual
intensely
in intensity a blusher in the shade
craving and taking the lighter shade on
this the way the brush changes place on
that basically where we pressed the
cream highlighter before so my eyebrows
I am taking this makeup forever pro
sculpting that brow pencil in this shade
number 40 and now onto the eyes I'm
taking the Urban Decay original pilot
potion then taking this sleek palette
that I divine palette and this warm
brown shade this is coming out February
10th it is the most gorgeous everyday
palette and I'm just taking my Sigma
e-40 brush and at buffing that into my
crease really softly and keeping the
shape quite rounded then it's further
deepen the socket I am taking the shade
redbrick from Mac and it just booty it
going into the crease and deepening it
up and then once again blending it out
with my Sigma e-40 to soften up the
edges
taking this pigment from makeup geek in
the shade Vegas lights it's like the
most amazing intense copper shade iron
and love with it and just holding a
tissue underneath just in case up the
fallout I am pressing this all over my
lid from the same sleek palette I'm
taking this dark brown shade to further
deepen the socket and then highlighting
my inner corner and a brow bone with
this really light shimmery pearl shade
I'm just lining my waterline obviously
I'm not doing a wink to look as rounded
but it's just to give a little face when
I apply the lashes obviously I am taking
my MSE at liquid liner as this isn't my
favorite and just doing a medium sort of
line across the lid then taking my
L'Oreal false lash sculpting muscari you
can just leave it there obviously you
don't have to wear false lashes I just
obviously love the appearance of and I
like this with lashes all any I
obviously and I am taking the red cherry
lashes in the style number 43 back to
the eyes I'm going back in with red
brick on a small pencil brush and just
buffing that on at my lower lash line to
really smoke out and tie it in with
obviously the blown out rounded eye that
we have going on on the top then I'm
taking a tiny bit of the pigment that we
used on the lid the Vegas lights pigment
from makeup geek and just pressing that
towards my inner corner to add a bit of
sparkle on the lower lash line and then
I'm just gonna be applying a bottom lash
mascara and I'm just using the same
mascara as before as well unser lips I
hear you guys I'm not doing a nude lip
this time I'm using a dark lip with this
look so I'm using the draw down a carbon
a pencil to line my lips and then I'm
using the Kat Von D studded lipstick in
the colour and motorhead I think which
is a really a gorgeous deep brown shade
I really love the Kat Von D lipstick
they have a few and I don't use them
enough they smell and go on amazingly
and then I'm going in with the Anastasia
Beverly Hills of black cherry lip gloss

finished look I really hope you guys
