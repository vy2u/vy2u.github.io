as you can see by the title today I'm
gonna be doing this crumbly crumbly
cranberry Coralie smokey eye with a
dramatic wing and some dark lips
obviously you compare with any lip color
red would look nice
and obviously nudes and stuff like that
I just haven't got a proper dark glossy
lip in ages I think I've only ever done
it once before my channel and it was
like my first ever video but um I just
thought I'd experiment but I'll leave
all the products that I'm using in the
description bar below because I know
sometimes you guys don't catch it when I
just say it even though I will say
everything that I'm using but I'll list
them all down below in the description
bar and but please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe if you enjoyed it and
leave in the comment section below
any videos you would like to see me do
in the future and this I look in
particular because it's really warm and
uses lots of like orangie Reds and stuff
like that it's really gonna make blue
and green eyes like pop so looks
stunning on every single eye color but
in particular blue and green eyes it
really enhances the color I really love
this I look so a you do to kids keep
watching and let me know in the comments
and like in whatever yeah without me
rambling on it's good story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
