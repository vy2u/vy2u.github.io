start painting my face I'm just applying
a light layer of foundation and my brows
then I'm popping in these eye contacts I
think these are just from eBay just
beforehand because I know my eyes get
really watery and I didn't want to ruin
my makeup then using this morphe 35c
player palette just applying this bright
orange eyeshadow I didn't put an eye
primer down just because I was going to
be applying a lot more products to my
eye and I just thought it was an
unnecessary step so I'm just packing
this shadow onto my lid an easy black
track from Mac I am just creating a
really harsh cut crease you don't have
to be a to clean with this because we're
gonna be painting upward so if you do
feel like you need to make a mess it's
kind of better to make the mess upwards
rather than onto the lid but yeah just
creating that cut crease look then I am
just creating a winged shape extending
it from the lower lash line and then
creating a thick kind of line on my top
lash line just like I would with a
normal winged eyeliner but just making a
bit thicker than normal and then just
connecting that to the cut crease
now for the slightly tricky part I am
creating the kind of triangular eye
design so I'm just painting upwards from
the line that I created from the cut
crease and then connecting it down
towards the wing I think it's kind of
easy if you just watch what I do
rather than me try and explain but then
once I've was happy with the shape I
just filled it in
taking this white face paint from the
snazaroo kind of I think it's just a
face paint set I really should have done
this beforehand so just a tip before I
would do the white bit just kind of
creating that white skin effect that
clowns have
using another cosmetic sponge just
applying the white facepaint underneath
the eyes like you would if you were just
doing a really strong highlighting look
taking this gel liner pencil from it
cosmetics I'm just really roughly lining
my waterline
if in a matte black shade from the same
35c palette on a large shader brush I'm
just buffing this underneath my eyes
kind of messily to create a scarier look
I decided to take this bright purpley
pink shade but you can pick any colors
you want where I've placed color you can
obviously replace them with whatever you
want I'm just buffing out the black that
I just placed it down
time for the lower triangular design I'm
just taking the black space paint from
the snazaroo set and as you can see just
taking a small eyeliner brush and doing
one from the inner corner the middle and
the outer corner in like a thin
triangular shape and just painting
little dots on the end of them all then
added two red dots on the top of the top
triangles and then painted a bigger
black circle on my nose if you're not
confident with going straight in with
paint then I recommend going in with a
black pencil first onto the lips I'm
taking this lip pencil from Mac in the
shade cherry and just outlining my lips
as normal for a scary clown I definitely
recommend red this ties in with the red
dots that we created or maybe even black
but as you'll see I do a little mix of
both fill up my lips I'm using the new
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in the shade candy apple
using the black face paint and the thin
eyeliner brush I'm using it to extend my
smile and like a creepy upwards motion
then use the painter line my lower lip
and my top lip a bit harsher
then just blending that in to create an
ombre look then taking the Kat Von D
shade and light palette and the gray
contour shade I'm really harshly
contouring my cheeks
then I'm just applying a light coat of
mascara I'm not gonna be wearing false
eyelashes just because I don't really
think it suits the clown theme and I'm
not applying any to my lower lashline
either just because you can't even see
my lashes so I didn't really think there
was any point then for my neck I am just
painting that pinstripe look with the
white and red face paints you could just
leave it there but I wanted to make
extra creepy so I'm going in with this
gel blood and just kind of dripping it
down from places that I thought would
make it look creepy so like the mouth
and the red dots that we painted on
earlier and then kind of creating a
tillich because I'm pretty sure there's
something about clowns being sad and I
thought that was quite creepy so I kind
of made it look like a blood tear but
just have fun it's Halloween and just
place it wherever you want but other
than that that's the finished look
so that's the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial that
was the last of my Halloween one so the
videos after this will be back to normal
but give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed
it and if you've recreates it make sure
to hashtag my name and tag me on
instagram but until then I'll see you
soon
