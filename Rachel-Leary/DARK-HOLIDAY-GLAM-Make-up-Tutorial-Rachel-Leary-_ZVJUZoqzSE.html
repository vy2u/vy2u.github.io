today I wanted to do something a bit
more dark and in the kind of festive
spirit of things so I kind of created
this dark glam holiday kind of
Christmasy makeup it's kind of using red
like plummy partly glittery goodness
stuff I don't know you guys know I'm
more normally all about those warm tones
and kind of like colors but I wanted to
mix it up a little bit and do something
a bit more dark this is also probably
really a kind of ideal for like New
Year's as well I know for New Year's
loads of people like kind of dark
glittery eyes and stuff you could
totally wear any kind of lip with this
you could wear a nude if you wanted to I
know if I was running this on a night
out I'd probably wear a nude but I
wanted to go for something dark and
glossy and yeah so I really hope you
guys enjoy this tutorial make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you do and let's
go ahead and get started
we are gonna do our eyes first but I am
just going to moisturize my skin so it
has time to sink in then I'm gonna go
ahead and prime my eyes using the
heart-shaped tape concealer in the shade
light/medium which will be the one that
I'm gonna be using on my face and then
I'm just blending that all over my lid
and underneath my eye as well and then I
just set that with powder to make sure
that all the items I put on top don't
cling to kind of like the moisture of
the primer and blend much easier then I
am going to be using shadows from the
Too Faced sweet peach palette and taking
this light warm brown shade here and
just blending that into my crease as the
initial transition color I'm gonna kind
of be creating a winged out shape but
nothing too sharp which is why when we
are doing the eyes first I'm not going
to be wiping away with the wipe this
time and we're just doing this because
there's gonna be fallout but you can
kind of see the shape I've created there
then I'm taking the next shade along and
again just kind of following the same
steps and deepening up the crease on a
smaller fluffy brush and kind of ending
it when it when I'm blending outwards
I'm kind of creating the point there's
that make sense you can kind of see what
I'm doing up better than I'm describing
that's for sure and then I'm going back
in with a fluffy brush as always to make
sure there is no harsh lines and the
colors are blended together but I'm not
picking up any additional product when I
do this I'm just using the brush itself
to blend then taking this dark purple
shade on a more defined crease brush
this one has a tapered point to it so I
can really get in it to at my crease and
again following the same steps on the
same motion again here you can kind of
see a lot clearer what I'm doing and
creating that more pointed shape with my
shadow and then again blending it back
in with the previous brown brother the
previous brush I used each time
for the base I'm gonna be taking it this
I polished from upper cosmetics in the
shade suede and using the little
applicator that it comes with I am just
pressing this onto my lid and I'm gonna
be using this as like I said like a
cream-based I won't anything I put on
the top it's gonna be as dark as this
you could just leave it as this because
this had such a gorgeous brownie gold
metallic finish to it but I did want it
to be a bit more on the purple ear pull
a mere Sykes I wanted it to tie in with
the lip so I'm just using that up
tapered brush that we used before again
with no additional product just to kind
of it blend the edges together and then
using the fluffy brush to blend that to
the glitter from OCC I'm taking this
color slate and then using matte reflex
blackened red and for the glitter glue
I'm taking it this one from NYX and on a
synthetic brush just kind of obviously
putting it all over my lid where I want
the glitz to go and then I kind of
dispensed a bit of each glitter on a
little pan and then it mix it together
and used my brush to put it on and as
you can see it kind of created this
purpley glitter I didn't really have an
exact pebble there and wants to use so I
thought mixing a red with a icy blue one
would kind of customize and create the
effect that I wanted and it definitely
gave a lot more dimension I think
because the reflex glitter is a lot more
refined and the occ glitter was a lot
more kind of sparkly and almost like 3d
about sense so they added a nice
dimension to the lid and then again just
going flat in with that tapered brush I
picked up some of that black shadow just
to deepen up the crease then I'm taking
the highlighter that I'm using on my
face and this is Oprah and it's their
new one in blissful it's more of a like
champagne e color I'm just gonna use
that as my inner corner highlight then
again with that black eye shadow this
time on a angled brush I'm just gonna
use this to kind of a tight line at my
upper lash line we're not creating a
winged eye anything like that is just
because I know I'm gonna be applying
lashes I think they look a lot clearer
when they apply if there is like
something there and for lashes I'm using
the harder beauty it lashes in Audrey
I'm obsessed with these onto the skin
I'm taking you in a masker and that veil
be careful not to drop
like I did I'm just placing that all
over my face and then blending that in
with the brush you guys know I don't
know why I just like to apply it my
problem with a brush I think my hands
always seem to get dirty while I'm doing
my makeup and this way I just make sure
it goes everywhere and for foundation
I'm using the toothpaste at Born This
Way Foundation in the shade
tan in the shade sand to match my tan
and I'm pressing it into the skin using
it this buffing brush from a blank
canvas cosmetics with this foundation I
definitely recommend using like a flat
top brush or a Beauty Blender otherwise
it can kind of sit on your skin it's so
it this way are you getting a kind of
maximum coverage from it and again using
the tape that's good take why can't I
talk see a shape taper can speed up from
the top that we use as the primer just
using that underneath with my eyes are
other places but I want to highlight as
always this is honestly one of my
favorite concealers I think if you're
from the UK they might sell it on QVC UK
so you don't have to pay shipping if
you're ordering from Sephora or anything
like that
and I'm not blending that in with my
amore Fiat gunmetal brush I can't
remember exactly which one this is but
that whole range is really incredible
for blending in creams and then I'm just
making sure to set that all in place
with powder
then I'm gonna click to do my brows I've
included how I do my brows in the last
couple of tutorials if you want to see
then you can go back and watch those and
then I'm gonna go ahead and apply this
pencil makeup further in my waterline
and as you can see this is why I never
wear things my waterline I suddenly look
so stoned but yes I'm now I'm going to
use it this a dark pearly black shade
and press that in it do it my lower lash
line like so just to add a bit more
drama and blend in with that dark color
we've just placed in the waterline and
then using a small pencil brush I am
gonna take that second brown shade that
we've used from the palette this warm
one here and use that to buff out that
color and kind of a soften out the edges
so it goes from kind of a dark from the
lash line to kind of smoke out
underneath if that makes sense
I also you can use this to connect to
that wing shape that you made with the
shadows in the crease then just applied
a bottom lash mascara and we can
continue on with the face I'm it taking
it this Tarte Amazonian clay bronzer and
just dusting that and using it to
contour and all the good things that a
bronzer does so just warming up my skin
and adding a bit more dimension that to
my face and then taking a smaller fluffy
brush and just using that tip slightly
up contour up my nose
the blusher I'm taking an old favorite
this is a Mac mineralized blush in the
shade it's dainty it's such a gorgeous
soft pink color as you can see and I
thought it was perfect for this look the
mineralized brushes are some of my
favorite ones and to kind of a prime it
for my highlight I'm taking this
strobing a souffle from its sleep this
is in the color smoky quartz it's more
of you golden one I know they have more
of a pink one and then going in with the
Oprah blissful highlighter on my Mac two
to four just to really intensify my
highlight because you want to be able to
see it from the guides I mean now on to
the lips I'm at taking it this matte
lipstick from huda beauty in the shade
it cheerleader which is such a gorgeous
red I actually thought it was a little
bit darker than it turned out to you
this was my first time using it and I am
so impressed with the formula of these
is actually really different to a lot of
the matte lipsticks I've tried but I did
want it to be a glossy purple lips I'm
going in with this lip gloss from
Anastasia Beverly Hills in the shade it
fix it vixen no venom and as you can see
it totally transforms the color so I may
as well have just gone in with a darker
lipstick to start with but that is the
finished makeup look so this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
