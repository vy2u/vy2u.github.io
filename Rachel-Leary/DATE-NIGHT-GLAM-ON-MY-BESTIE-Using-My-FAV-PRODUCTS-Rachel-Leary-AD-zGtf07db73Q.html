year is and all the other products I've
used to create this look on honey
then make sure to give this video a
thumbs up subscribe to me subscribe to
Hannah and Hannah and continue watching
kickstart off my top 10 products we are
going in with summit skincare this is
the fissile unicorn Esmond serum
I've become obsessed with this over the
past year I'm sure you've seen it all
over Instagram it smells like vanilla it
really really hydrates the skin and if
you have dry skin like hand this
honestly makes the perfect base and
gives the most gorgeous glow so I was
obviously it gonna be adding that to at
my list now this is my number one top
favorite this is the huda beauty foe
filter foundation you can see here the
coverage is in
saying this honestly lasts all day it
doesn't budge and especially if you have
dry skin like Hannah it's definitely not
going to move either I thought this
would be perfect for date night because
obvious you don't want your makeup to
come up or get oily or anything like
that and I always like to apply it with
a stippling brush and then it buff it in
with a Beauty Blender then again this is
a new favorite and this is on my list as
well this is the beauty of bakery flour
translucent powder something like that
this is a new favorite but you can see
the difference here I just applied it to
one half of her face and Hannah was
honestly shook this is a good little
comparison up close it honestly smooths
out your skin makes it look just like
airbrushed I'm not even kidding so
absorbed any of the excess oil on her
skin and just is gonna make her makeup
last all day which is again perfect for
date night this is also on my list this
is the Anastasia Beverly Hills powder
contour kit but this one is in the shade
medium I love a good a powder contour
kit and this shade range is so warm and
complimentary on so at many skin types
and I'm just going in with a small
contour brush to contour her nose and
just to fine it a little bit more to
give a gorgeous structured face now this
isn't actually on my list but I thought
I would include it anyway because you
can get it from cult beauty and
Anastasia Beverly Hills is having free
shipping on cult Beauty right now but
this is on my list this is the benefit
precisely my brow pencil in the shade
for I'm obsessed with precise brow
pencils oh my god I can't even tell you
so I was obviously gonna have one on my
list I'm just using the shade four to
fill in her brow slightly and feather it
towards the front you guys know the
drill I love these because you can be
super super precise and mimic the
appearance of a Barajas and it's a
really kind of softer appearance but I'm
gonna go in with the anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow in a dark brown which is
actually on Hannah's favorite so I did
wanna use that on her today and I'm just
gonna use this to further add detail and
darken at the tail of her brow and to
set it all in place using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills clear brow gel this isn't
on my list either but it is just a
general favorite that you can't get from
cult Beauty - like I said set it all in
place I feel like this this is a must
for date night you want to keep it all
in place but her brows are now on fleek
and we can move on to the skin
these aren't on my top ten but these are
just some gorgeous gorgeous products
that I love anyway and I'm just using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid glow
in a peach is
to kind of create a glow to the skin and
also add a base when we apply a powder
highlighter and I'm just gonna apply
that on all the places that I am gonna
be applying the powder highlighter you
guys know I love to do this and I think
it just creates the most gorgeous fresh
skin perfect for date night skin and the
highlighter I'm gonna use is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills at powder
contour kit and this is the ultimate
glow kit just mixing a few shades
together in all the places that I
applied the cream to really make them a
pop and stand out I've been loving doing
this over the past year you guys know
and these are some of my favorite
products to do so and while it's free
shipping you guys should probably and
make the most onto the eyes I'm just
using some warm crease colors from the
palette that Hannah uses in her video so
you can go over there and check it out
but this is one of my favorite products
on my list this is the Stila magnificent
metals liquid eyeshadow in the shade
gold retro Hannah literally fell in love
with this and I can't believe she hadn't
used it when I was applying it to her
these are my favorite I'm not even
joking they're so quick so effortless
they add the most perfect glitter and
just shimmery touch look at it honestly
if you've got green eyes or blue eyes
this is honestly gonna be stunning and
it makes my makeup so just so quick and
over the past year has literally saved
my life so it was although gonna be on
my list so we just finished off the top
of the eyes with mascara and lashes but
this next product is on my top 10 this
is the NYX eyeliner in a golden bronze I
think this is the most gorgeous
alternative to black or brown it
complements of blue-green eyes basically
actually any eye color and I feel like
it transformed this look into more like
a sultry date night look and I've been
at loving this over the past year so it
definite the list and this is also on my
list this is the NYX lip pencil in a
nude suede shoes such a go-to nude and I
love the formula of these they go on it
so nicely and I thought this was a
really subtle everyday nude which is
what I've been using it for to
complement the next product that's on my
list NYX soft matte lip cream in Cairo
you guys know this has been a favorite
of mine over the past year it's honestly
one of my perfect shades of nude and it
complements the lip pencil perfectly it
for like a really gorgeous subtle nude
combo so if you haven't already checked
that out you definitely shouldn't have
linked them down below and to finish off
the lips I just use one of Hannah's
favorite products this is the jouer a
lip dropper in a skinny dip again over
the past year
a nude cult favorite and that's one
Hanna's list but the final product of
mine is the cover effects illuminating
setting spray if you've got dry skin it
this just looks your makeup in place
leaving you with the most gorgeous glow
said that definitely it made my list too
but this is the finished makeup look I
think she looks absolutely stunning I
mean come on now
