this is just a brief soft glam makeup
look that is designed to still be glam
still look lamb but also last a long
time as well I'm just kind of helps us
out if you think a bunch of my favorite
products as well because I feel like on
Valentine's Day or like whatever you're
already using this tutorial you want to
feel confident and feel good and I feel
when you're wearing products that you
know it look great on you or like are
your favorite products anyway that's
when you feel your best so I've tried to
do that as well for you if you like the
concept of this video make sure to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe if you
haven't already
this is everything down below so let's
go ahead and get started I'm going to go
ahead and do my eyebrows first and if
you're like me and have to kind of
extend it a lot I find that the product
lasts longer straight onto the skin
rather than doing foundation so I'm
going to take my anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow in soft brown and this is from
Inglot it's federline this if you add it
to anything it makes it like waterproof
and a lot creamier and easier to apply
and so these two are like a winning
combination if you literally don't want
your eyebrows to budge if you like me
and have to like extend your brows young
you obviously don't want to end up by
Braille and like I said I always find it
lasts a lot longer that goes directly
onto like dry skin then once you've done
your eyebrows you just want to go ahead
and set them as like a clear brow gel to
extra lock them in so I'm not going to
do any eyeliner with this look I feel
like eyeliners it's a recipe for
disaster and like a rush and you deaf or
deaf or deaf I want to look good and not
hundred percent confident with eyeliner
just skip it there's other ways to make
your eyes look freaky I'm going to go
straight on to skin so I'm going to go
ahead and moisturize my skin first using
the mac's fix+ spray this has a little
little bit I'm attached to it when it
dried which is another reason why I love
it not only does it like moisturize but
then like I said it adds a little bit of
tack but I'm still going to go ahead and
apply a primer anyway I do like to buff
the excess edges with a brush one
specifically gives you a nice little
glow from underneath as well now for
primer I did a look on how to make your
makeup last all day a little not too
long ago so I didn't want to kind of do
the same thing or use the same product
so another primer I really really love
that I feel like my makeup lasts do
anything through is the toothpaste hang
of the X primer I'm just going to go
ahead and use the same brush to just
buff that in obviously got to be careful
around your brows which is really
pressing it into the skin so your skin
really absorbs it and there's no kind of
like excess that's going to interfere
with the foundation or anything okay
with skin prep done and brows done let's
move on to foundation I'm going to use
two just cuz I'm extra and if I want my
skin to look flawless I do feel like
kind of the more you wear the longer it
lasts if you apply it right because some
so you don't look cakey so a foundation
I'm going to take the maybelline and map
me poorest ones because it's a matte
finish and this one I find is quite it's
a really nice natural coverage I am
going to add coverage with something
else
so I'm just going to top that all over
my face and then after M
okay and like I said I'm just going to
apply a tiny bit of a different
foundation just to add a little bit more
coverage or two areas that I know like
my makeup might come off a bit easier
than others I'm going to take via
coverfx cream foundation I'm going to
take a buffing brush this one is the
delay the silk finish one I'm just going
to kind of like stab my brush in like
that and the areas I find that makeup
comes off the easier so I'm pretty sure
it's quite quite similar for a lot of
people is on my nose so I'm going to
like skip all that product into my nose
and like around it and then another
place that I just kind of prefer maybe a
bit more coverage not necessarily
because it comes off the easiest is just
this area here so you can see language I
like pressing it into the skin okay onto
a highlighter and kind of cream contour
I'm going to take the NYX sculpt and a
highlight in in taupe and ivory I find
it using a cream - the contour last a
lot longer because it gives kind of like
a base to your bronzer I'm just going to
place this underneath my eye and then
I'm going to go ahead and blend that in
it with a Beauty Blender make sure any
wool make sure that it's sufficiently
stamps obviously not like drenched this
is I feel like everyone's been saying
this moment I worked on this video and I
watched Jack and her video and everyone
just says this is honestly the number
one st. like blending out your under-eye
so I'm just going to press that into the
skin this is kind of it absorbs any
excess product and make sure there's no
like residue you're like obvious layers
to your skin which is why it's such a
great product and then once you have you
done the highlight side you can cream up
contour so I'm just going to take this
shade and just run this along like my
cheekbone it's quite a cool color so I'm
not going to put it around the tops of
my forehead because I like to warm that
up with bronzer then just taking a duo
fiber brush to initially blend it in and
I just like to go in with a Beauty
Blender and just make sure everything is
just like pressing
now I feel like this is the most
important part and that is just once if
you've done all the creams on your face
but you're going to do set it in place
this or the RCM a no color powder or
what kind of a just a loose translucent
setting powder is going to be your best
friend so kind of any occasion not
necessarily just this like to set your
under eyes with it really helps brighten
but also just completely mattifies and
just looks everything in that's a good
thing about a loose powder just absorbs
excess moisture and it just looked and
good so just on my sponge again I'm
going to take some of this Laura powder
and just press into my under eye you
want to use this baking method to kind
of a brighten any area but then hope I
just dust it everywhere afterwards
because I don't want to bless any point
every where by doing us that everywhere
in place while our under eye is like
setting and stuff I'm going to go ahead
and do my eyes in case you get any
fallout from the products I can just
wipe it away I don't think I've used
this yet in a tutorial but loads of you
asked me to use it it is the a violent
bus ride or die pallet literally it
contains every color Under the Sun I
love them and I'm just going to go ahead
and take the shape Abigale as our
initial transition color so I'm just
going to buff that into the crease I'm
kind of going to do a blown-out lip just
because I feel like that's just you can
kind of feel see like Dinah sighs it's
just more like sultry and seductive I
find I think sometimes like a pretty
strong winged liner might because I like
intimidating I mean you're doing your
makeup yourself at the end of the day
but just feel like these are kind of
more like filtery and it's going to bust
that in to the crease and then just kind
of like making sure when I'm buffing
outwards it's when I've got like a
minimal product so we're not looking at
within punched in the eye then I'm going
to really lightly it get my brush into
the set shade Josie and really kind of
build up the smokiness of our outer
corner I think like warm Browns and like
only region like a dark brown is like
your dark smoky color is a lot more
teasing love story that you know I mean
the more complementary a lot more it
still makes an impact without being too
heavy and then once you're happy with
the intensity just going back in with
our initial fluffy brush that we use
just to confuse and below everything
else kind of nude color I'm actually
going to take the infallible eyeshadow
from L'Oreal and it's rumor shade iced
latte now what I love about this is it's
actually slightly creamier and I find
creams unlike over like a cream
eyeshadow once they like set in place
they last like the longest time they
literally don't budge and this one's
more of like a powdery cream formula so
it kind of mixes both if you don't 100%
might love cream eyeshadows these are
really nice formula apply that all over
my empty mid-space and I've ever asked
like a boy ever like on you know what
makeup do you like actually like not
because it's like I really really care
and like because they said I'm going to
do that but because I was actually just
like interesting is that you've set your
guy mate so ever they've always said
something light and shimmery on your lid
and I feel like this kind of like opens
up your eye and enjoyed attention to
your eye and then it kind of gets like
darker and sulci are towards the end
just going to go back in with my fluffy
brush and just diffuse the edges now
just because this is makeup that you
want to last a long time and stuff I
still feel like you can write glitter if
you apply it right and you could go
ahead and fill on use a glitter glow but
I didn't really want the glyphs to be
that intense I just kind of want it to
be like a fool if you just like shut
your eyes so it's something kind of like
factoring and not too intense or
anything that's going to like really
irritate you or anything like that so
I'm going to take the reflex pearl
glitter from Mac it's a really really
refined glitter it's super comfortable
to wear on the eyes and not they're like
who's you any irritation or anything so
let's do it take a little bit of the
glitter on my brush
spray a couple of times with six plus
and then going to look down and read my
eye with six plus as well and then just
go ahead and Pat it on obviously the
places that you want the glitter to be I
just like to pop it on and to be fair at
the end of the day than running matter
if this really comes off or doesn't last
because you've got that really gorgeous
I shadow underneath which was girl like
shimmer through duping back into this
eyeshadow palette I'm going to take the
shade Courtney mixed with Rachael and on
a really small definer brush like this
this is for one from its Sigma it is
something that I can't even see the like
names come off I'm just going to
concentrate this on our like outer
crease I don't on the crease to be too
dark so I'm going to go back in with the
fluffy brush pick up a bit that Josie
shade and I mix it a bit with a Courtney
color and just make sure it's all
blended together and then I take this
flat brush from NYX it is via number 10
onion pick up that Rachel color and I'm
just going to really it lightly line at
the top of my lash line but which we
just smudging motions and I'm not going
to go like all the way across just kind
of like three courses away and I feel
like this is a really effective way
especially if you know that you're going
to wear eyelashes or like fake lashes
just to kind of hide them without having
to do a winged liner and still give that
kind of smoky liner effect kind of
zigzagging motions and just press this
into the lashline literally just like
that I'm now going to go ahead and wipe
everything away and then going to take
that same a creamy shadowy color from
L'Oreal and use that to highlight my
inner corner and my brow bone now to
finish off the under eye and actually
it's going to take the shade Oh
Ashley which is slightly warmer than the
ones that we've been using but that's
because I find anything that you put
underneath your eye really it makes your
eyes pop and like make them look like
the best color that they can if you've
got slightly green eyes a slightly more
perfectly a base Brown will really bring
them out if you've got brown eyes you
can kind of go through more of the
warmest tone or the kind of purpura tone
like more of a gray kind of either
warmer is the woods like the more your
idol pop I feel like eyes are really
important like they're my favorite
feature and other people they're my
favorite feature on myself I really
think that they're in a Mike you can
have loads of eye contact and stuff so I
said if you want to make your eyes look
the best
to me that's putting something really
warm underneath and you can take a
pencil brush and buff that in and you've
kind of connect it to what we've done
here then it taking that same NYX flat
brush and that Courtney shade I'm just
going to push this really in it to my
lower lash line as well so this is more
of a dark brown then that's at the
waterline I'm going to take this pencil
from a makeup forever it is like a soft
dark brown and it's a color number of B
at 62 and I always find like you when
your eyes to not almost look like look
well yeah I feel like you want them to
look more clothes it's that you put
something like bright and white in your
water line that's kind of meant to make
your eyes that more like bigger and
stuff like that could be quite like
intimidating so something Brown nothing
like I'm you can see I'm using a lot of
Browns on black so if you like black me
quite harsh just coat you my opinion for
my eyes personally I love if I'm going
to put something dark my waterline just
use a nice soft brown and these ones are
meant to be extra long lasting and a
waterproof so my eyes always go a little
bit bloodshot off go do that I'm now
just going to go ahead and client
mascara and then lashes so just going
ahead and applied mascara and if you've
got like super long voluminous lashes or
you're not confident in wearing falsies
then just leave it there but just
because it's just like makeup that's
most lost and I feel like a lot of
people's their problem is based on their
lashes like paying off the weather but
you do them the right way I still feel
like they add like an extra little bit
of glam to a look and there while my
favorite things to wear all the time but
on a time like this I probably
definitely wear them so once I'm going
to use are from a flutter and they look
like well there we go and they look like
this so they're super whiskey and they
have a slight wing to them the names are
on the box but I'll leave it links down
below I do think there's people wispy
and flirty and they're nothing too much
or anything that you're going to like
feel really like heavy or like weighed
down by so I'm just going to go ahead
and apply those and then I will show you
this inside don't you just think these
are like I know that did a perfect
amount of like drama and with what
without kind of being too much so I'm
obsessive them so these are the finished
eyes I feel like they're super sultry I
feel like I'm quite competent at Buford
at last
a long time or not I mean nothing at to
had me glam it so it's actually quite
quick to do as well if you're in a rush
you know this is the kind of soft
glamour slip I came up with and now we
can be buckle to the skin
so we already kind of cream contour so
I'm just going to lightly bronze my skin
but that I'm going to take via bourgeois
chocolate from Zhou I feel like they've
has a really gorgeous glow to it super
nice warming tone as well plus my white
chocolate from I'm going to be a like
kinda close to your face kind of smell
then I'm just going to apply that just
above where we placed the cream contour
to warm up the skin and this is where
I'm going to apply this kind of around
the temples of my forehead just as like
a a soft bronze but then I'm also going
to going with one of my lychee from my
favorite products to we're just kind of
before I go out or anything and it is
max global glow I know this is meant
it's like a highlighter but honestly on
a big brush like this this is a Mac one
free side just dusting next like I
justice here so like the top of my
forehead just clover over where I taste
that bottom jaw and some and just like
besides my nose and stuff anything it
gives a really gorgeous inner glow and
like almost preps your skin for when you
apply highlighter for that I'm going to
apply a blusher and this is NARS orgasm
look at go ahead of ourselves
you have none on massive Russia where I
see colors like this a bright on my
street Plus this has a really gorgeous
like gold reflex running through it so
that ties in with like everything else
that you had going on on your skin and
then for highlighter I'm going to take
Geoffrey start King top which is a
really gorgeous gold color on a small
fluffy brush now the formula a deed is
super creamy and I find a more creamier
highlighters stays on the skin a lot
longer and I paid a lot more like writer
and they blend a lot easier into the
skin as well like the sleek palettes are
the same they're really creamy and they
really blend into the skin I feel like
powdered you're just kind of putting it
on to just white straight off so I'm
really kind of pressing and blending
this in
so if you like turning to the side you
go out for dinner scandal at all and you
can say yes Adam I am glowing and then
just on the bridge of my nose and really
pretty like between your brows I think
in pictures and then my Cupid's bow as
well now onto the lips I feel like a
matte matte lipstick is a must I feel
like if you put a gloss on
if the gloss comes off everything comes
off so it definitely stick to a matte
and stick to a formula you know that
lasts a long time and that you're
comfortable with wearing I feel like you
want your lips to almost look color wise
as natural as possible and then I think
having your lips maybe looking slightly
fuller so they look morning do you see I
love that look just because I love the
appearance of fill in it anyway so I'm
going to go ahead and line my lips and
this is the colourpop lip liner in
deeper I thought you don't want anything
too dark but you're not going to feel
comfortable wearing but then anything to
a light that's going to be quite like me
and I know I'd only love love love a
light nude but feel like something
slightly darker for this look so my
color choice today is the dose of colors
liquid lipstick in a truffle I feel like
this is a really gorgeous kind of stuff
you rose nude kind of color a really
gorgeous color if you've never tried it
before then I am just going to go back
in a tiny bit more with that Jeffrey's
car highlighter on the Cupid's bow again
just after this Drive and I feel like it
makes your lips appear a lot of summer
and kind of would like draw attention to
them and then they can see the gorgeous
lips that you have and I press a tiny
bit in the middle as well but finally
I'm going to use the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray the name it says
why we're going to be using this one
oh did anyone see that mean that went
around about this and it was like a
screenshot of someone's comment that
