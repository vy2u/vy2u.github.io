fast things fast we have a newer colored
background of a few colors I've just
purchased so let me know how you're
feeling about mixing up the backgrounds
if you like it then give this video a
thumbs up already as you can tell by the
title today we are recreating the most
gorgeous look recently seen on a demi
lovato i'll insert a picture of it here
is like an all metallic eye using blues
and purples it's a bit different for me
so I'm so glad that so many of you guys
asked me to do it and she was rocking
like an updo and big hoops which is
something that I've been loving at the
moment so I thought I'll include the
whole thing I'm using a bunch of newer
products as well that I haven't yet used
on camera yet I don't think I feel like
let's just go ahead and get started I
used to do inspired looks all the time
on my channel so I'm so excited to be
doing a another one so let's get hair
out the way first it's actually really
easy
it's basically what I did in a tutorial
get ready with me a couple of videos
back so I'll like insert a card for that
video there if you're interested all
I've done is tie my hair up in a up
doing kind of giving it a loose curl she
I couldn't really tell from the picture
if she'd curled it or not but I
basically just threw my hat up in a
ponytail and gave it a little curl the
wand but now we're gonna clip back our
baby hairs because they are the pain of
life and hers was pretty like slip back
so we want ours to look just as sleep
boys the ones underneath as well that I
forget about now this is lychee been a
lifesaver for me and I'm used again in
my last video it is the ever gray like -
dark brown hair like root touch-up so
for me I just get these little like
marks here and well not marks I just
have like a receding hairline at the age
of 21 which I prefer to fill in slightly
so that is what we're gonna go ahead and
do it now and it makes such a difference
for updos that especially if you like a
sleek back lips this little sponge makes
it so like natural and like blend so
nicely into your hair and especially if
you have like maybe lighter roots coming
through like me or you just you know
great this actually like meant for gray
hair yeah any sort of like root problems
that you
might be facing this is like insane so
once I have like filled in my roots all
I need to do now is just kind of hold
back my hair and use some hairspray to
just sleek it all back and make sure
it's gonna stay in place
that was the hair complete literally
it's so it's so it's simple which is why
I've been loving doing that hair at the
Munks I feel like it looks like a lot of
ever was put in and I'm sure when Demi
actually did go ahead done a lot of
effort was put in just looks really like
effortless and put together which is
where another but now we can move on to
the makeup okay so if you always see me
like looking in this direction it's
because I've got the pictures up of her
makeup there for reference but her skin
it literally looks flawless and really
just kind of like moisturized but
covered if that makes sense so it fun
moisturizer today I'm gonna take the
touch Julia's skin mist and just kind of
douse my skin all in that and what
that's gonna do is just really hydrate
our skin and give a really do you base
underneath now that's all a soaked in we
can move on to a primer and today I'm
going to take the YSL or ours primer
because we wanna make up to one last all
day and - this is just a really gorgeous
mix of like smoothing nurse but also
really hydrating on the skin as well it
really does feel like a cream on the
skin but it's so like lightweight and
silky smooth I can tell it's definitely
a primer and that's kind of like one of
my favorite combinations in skincare and
primers in general something super
hydrating and smooth it doesn't sit on
the skin but already feels like it's
doing its job so for foundation today
I'm gonna be taking the effective bt
foundation in the shade 290 because her
skin literally looked airbrush I feel
like that might just be her like natural
skin in general being naturally a
 flawless but this is gonna give
us that illusion if you don't have that
skin I'm just gonna apply in a couple of
pumps back either side and then just
work it in with my Beauty Blender I feel
like this foundation literally gives
like no flashback in photos and in the
pictures that I'm recreating off Demi's
makeup the only thing that's really kind
of brightened and flashback is her
I thought that's just because that was
the look she was claiming she's got a
very bronzed
contoured face and like a light under
eye which I can really appreciate and I
love that kind of look
but her foundation just looked true to
color and had no flashback and just
looked super flawless so I feel like
this is the perfect foundation to use
for that okay so with a foundation
complete we can move on to concealer
like you can see in the picture and like
I said Addis you did have a really
bright under-eye so I'm gonna go with a
lighter consider than I probably usually
would and this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 20 so this is
just like a super bright yellow base
concealer and I love this one it's such
an affordable concealer for one but has
such amazing coverage and she's
definitely got it going on like all
through the center of her face as well
so just applying that another place that
I wanna brighten up which like I said in
the picture is kind of all the center
and all the places that I usually
probably weren't so just gonna blend
that in again I'm just gonna use the
same Beauty Blender as my foundation
because ain't nobody got time to have to
beauty blenders I always feel like I got
up a hundred at miles an hour when I'm
using my Beauty Blender I like watch my
videos but what I'm editing them but
yeah let me know what you guys think of
the new backgrounds I'm feeling for like
a makeup tutorials and stuff it might be
more fun to have a colored background
and then for my more sit down chatty
videos I really like how I've done my
bedroom recently and letting you guys
say you like the more relaxed background
too so I thought like we're gonna do
those kind of more relaxed videos and
yeah like my more relaxed background
okay cool so that is the concealer done
now she has a very light bronze looks
I'm gonna go ahead and use a cream at
bronzer this is the Sun kind of gorgeous
cream at foundation from benefit in the
shade deep I think I use this in a
really recent video as well I just love
the way that well one I love the color
and two I just love the like Sheerness
of it and the way that it blends into
the skin so I'm just gonna be applying
this on my forehead and on my cheekbones
and like I'm like drawing stuff cuz ask
the clear places that she's been warmed
up on her skin particularly actually her
head so maybe when she has up tears she
gets conscious and feels like we got a
corn swore and browns and I let's just
use a stippling brush to blend it all in
and literally just blend like a dream I
only kind of lightly dab my brush into
this product because I feel like it
could be super pigmented but when you
just lightly do it
you can build it up and kind of kind of
customize it more to the coverage that
you're after now you don't have to do
this step but it's like a new product
I've got my hands and I really want to
use and she's looking at so bronzed and
like glowy that I thought it was super
appropriate I know we just cream bronzed
but this is the Maybelline and gigi
hadid strobing liquid in gold and I feel
like this is just gonna add the most
perfect below because it's of a deeper
color and I kind of want to just put it
over my chest yeah so I'm just gonna
know like stipple this on top just
really get that bronze glow going okay
now we are like bronzed and bellowing we
can set everything in place with a
powder just underneath the eyes and just
kind of push off and up our bronze not
necessarily contour but just warming up
the skin I am just kind of avoiding the
shimmery area so just dusting kind of
lightly past that but I'm just pressing
it into the skin cuz I do want it to be
kind of bright underneath there I'm
gonna let that sit there for a sec to
sharpen up even though we are gonna
contour again like I said we are going
to contour again because when I look at
her I don't see a lot of bronzer I saw I
can see warmth but how contour and I've
had cheekbones just looks insane and
it's also definitely a lot more blush
focus and there's barely any highlighter
which kind of Concerned me a little bit
but we'll roll there so I'm now just
gonna further contour my skin and i'm
using the morphe ax9 see a palette to do
so and I'm just gonna take this matte
contour color here one of the slightly
alight ones just because I don't want to
go to too heavy
you guys see that Morpheus now coming to
the UK they're like making a UK store
which is going to be it so so so good so
the multi stuff that I gets and I feel
like beautybay and stuff do stock them
but it's so in-demand that's always out
of stock all of the time and now I won't
feel so bad to use it so now we have a
Demi Lovato's cheekbones and now we can
get her abolished so I'm using the Becca
flower child blusher because the blusher
Demi was using was definitely more of a
pink undertone to tie in with the lips
that she had going on but it was still
super gooey and glowy this is literally
at the perfect one the Becca mineral
blushes are so nice and this one
definitely has like a shimmer and glow
running through it normally I would want
my blusher to be a bit more like subtler
like more subtle than this but hers is
very prominent on her cheeks so as this
has an inspired look we're gonna stick
to that and the a final step the skin
which I wasn't even sure I was gonna do
because I really can't see any highlight
like on her skin but to be fair she is a
front-facing in the pictures and when
she goes like that there's nothing too
too obvious there so I'm gonna take the
Elora gala baked as well illuminator in
peach glow which is more of like a peach
undertone based highlighter whatever and
yet definitely gives more of an eight
below to the skin which I feel is the
vibe she's going for rather than like a
beaming highlight okay so with the demi
skin finished we can now move on to
brows and eyes which I feel like they're
the most captivating and like
attention-grabbing part of the photos so
let's go ahead and zoom in okay so I did
go ahead and do it one iron brow
off-camera just because I really wasn't
sure how I was gonna tackle it and I
thought I just want to double-check the
fallout situation but all is good in the
hood so let's go ahead and start
so her brow is definitely a lot stronger
than I usually wear mine at the moment
so I'm gonna go in with my anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in medium brown
and she definitely has more of like a
straight brow going on but i do just
like to line the bottom of my brow and
then also the top and just kind of got a
bit straighter than I usually would go
to really kind of
striking brow and then as you get
towards the front of your brow she
definitely has the more feathered look
going on and it is very not like blocky
but definitely more of the rectangular
look going on so once we have done the
brow I'm just gonna go ahead and set it
in place using my gimme brow from a
benefit this is in the shade 3 and this
is just gonna make them look super
feathery and fill like hers and just
look thicker as well okay so for
eyeshadow we are gonna be taking the
hooded Beauty desert dusk eyeshadow
palette and just start with I'm gonna be
taking the shade even as our initial
transition color even though the all the
color you can see really in her eye
shadow look is purple I always go in
with just like a warm brown shade to
start with because that acts as a really
great color to just gonna help blend
anything out now the shape of her eye
look is very blown out which I love and
that's kind of why I felt comfortable
doing on my skin first as I'm not going
to be kind of creating any sharp lines
or anything like that
dip in the back into the same palette
I'm gonna take this shade here which is
literally just the bright purple shade
on it the same brush this one is
actually called as in the shade is
called amethyst and we're just gonna use
this do you create that blown-out shape
and also build up that gorgeous purple
color that you can see so clearly in how
my makeup it's super blown out and kind
of like edgy looking so perfect for
those of you that maybe aren't so
comfortable doing eye shows because it's
almost like the edgier it looks the
better it looks you know we are now
switching palettes ignore the Rachel I
went to the Urban Decay event where they
gave this to us this is the heavy metals
eyeshadow palette from Urban Decay it's
all metallic shades so perfect for this
look I'm going to be mixing the two blue
shades together called dive and amp dive
is more of the electric blue and amp has
a slight teal undertone to it and I'm
just gonna use a real small brush and
just kind of drag it on to my lid you do
get a little bit of fall out with these
shadows but because we've apparent
it's super easy to just brush that all
away from the same palette I'm gonna be
mixing these two purple shades together
to kind of create a transition into the
crease I'm just gonna kind of press that
here where the blue is and then drag it
in to the crease because we are gonna be
using another crease color that's gonna
be a bit darker so it's gonna kind of
create that metallic transition going
across the eye so I'm just gonna be
dipping on my brush into the two at
darkest colors here so we just used
those two and now we're using these two
and we're going to use a much more
precise fluffy brush for this cuz this
color is really prominent in her crease
and is used to kind of create that
winged out blown-out shape I'm just
taking it all the way up into the crease
and then buffing it out slowly and then
I'm gonna go in with a fluffy brush that
we used with that initial purple color
to diffuse everything together and just
make sure it's all blended now we can
just lightly brush away that fallout
underneath the eye now we can move on it
to the rest of the eye so I'm just gonna
be taking a pale white shirring it shade
in my inner corner then open the same
Urban Decay eyeshadow palette I'm just
gonna take that dark purple shade that
we've used to so much on a small flat
brush and just really push that into the
lower lash line like so and then again
it just with the fluffy brush that we
used with that purple just kind of
diffuse that out so I really analyze the
picture it looked as if a Demi had
something really dark blue in her
waterline so I'm gonna take the Marc
Jacobs Highliner in wave length and just
yeah put that in at my lower jaw okay so
I'm gonna go ahead and do a mascara and
lashes and the lashes were definitely a
key feature of her look they're so big
and so full so I'm gonna be taking the
Danny Beauty Store lashes in slay these
are the new luxe range of lashes created
by Danny Matteson you probably follow
her here on YouTube and I thought these
are the perfect style for this look so
I'm
go ahead and apply them now okay so
these are the eyes with the lashes on oh
my god
I'm like obsessed with this lip these
lashes Danny done such a good job oh my
god but now we can move on to the lips
okay so she definitely had like a baby
Barbie pink lip going on
I couldn't find a gloss in that color so
what we are going to be doing is kind of
using a little bit of a liquid lipstick
and then going in with a clear gloss on
top so the liquid lipstick and we'll be
using is Anastasia Beverly Hills and
this isn't the color blush obviously
these dry down to be a map she had a
clear gloss on and also her lips look
pretty full too so I thought why not try
the three faced a clear lip injection
gloss oh my god if you've never tried
this this really burns I'm just gonna
kind of go over my finger pain I feel
this is the finished look complete and
now we just got a I don't know
so this is the finished makeup look I
