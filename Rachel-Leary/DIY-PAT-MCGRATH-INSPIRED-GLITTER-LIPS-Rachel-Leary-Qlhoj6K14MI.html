slightly different type of video today
it is a DIY lip tutorial on glitter lips
I've seen these everywhere I've seen
them at festivals and recently I've been
seeing them all over social media
because the incredible and my chronic
Pat McGrath I think is coming out with
like glitter lip kits so for those of us
that one may not be able to hold of them
- I didn't even think that out yet so
I'm just impatient and three are just
obsessed with glitter like me I have
come up with six splintered lips
combinations for you guys to try or just
be inspired by to do your own this lip
is not suitable for people maybe going
on a date or you thing they are just
kind of just to show it so that's kind
of why they're good like festivals for a
bit just because if you're talking or
even maybe if you're just wanting to
take pictures or something because
they're not they don't last the longest
time and they're definitely not good if
you're gonna be eating stuff with others
come on yeah it's just more of like an
artistic look so I really hope you guys
enjoy this tutorial
definitely let me know if you recreate
any of them or you're inspired by the
menu do your own combinations definitely
tag me on Instagram or my social media
links are down below this is one of the
options this is the nude gold one
obviously I'm obsessive nudes that there
are loads of colors in here as you'll
see I demonstrate how to do one and then
the process for all of the other ones is
exactly the same and I've just show you
the products for those and then the
finished result but make sure to give
this video a thumbs up and share you
enjoy and let's go on with the tutorial
okay so to start off this Blitzer lips
tutorial I am gonna be kind of doing the
same process for each one so I'm gonna
show you how I do the first one and
explain every step of the way and then
I'm just gonna kind of speed through the
rest but obviously it show you and tell
you which products that I'm using so to
start off with I'm gonna be a priming my
lips and this is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills lip primer I'm gonna be applying
that all over like so
so the first illumination I'm going to
do is a pink one now for each lip
combination I have a lipstick and then
two glitters to go with it
just because from what I saw Fermat's
Pat McGrath kind of look there was a lot
of dimension going on and I think that
can be achieved with kind of two tones
of glitter for each color so each
lipstick I'm using kind of has a satin
finish by I'm gonna be going in with a
clear lip gloss on top of every
combination just because that's going to
give it some extra adhesive I could
never say this word and he's super teen
for when I press the glitter on so
that's like I said the first one I'm
going to be doing is a pink combination
and for this I am using it via soap &amp;amp;
Glory sexy mother pucker lipstick in
pink up girl so it just looks like this
and I'm going to be applying that all
over the lip
once you've applied your lipstick like I
said I'm gonna go in with the a Mac
clear lip gloss and I'm just going to
put a tiny bit this on my finger and
then dab on the top and I'm going to be
doing this on top of every lipsticks
that I use
this is gonna kind of act as the glue
that's going to hold the glitter on and
it's not going to change the color of
the lipstick because it's correct so
we're going to still get the paint
coming through for the pink glitter I am
taking this glitter from Coastal Scents
in an arena dream and this one from eye
candy in peach fizz like I said I'm
taking two most of the ones that I pick
are kind of like a light and dark one of
the color lipstick that I've chosen just
to add a bit more dimension and kind of
like different tones as you can see the
batter in a dream ones a really light
pink and it is the peach this one is
definitely more of a dark thing so what
I'm gonna do is take a spatula you can
get these off Amazon this one I think is
actually for a Mac but I'm gonna take a
tiny scoop of each one or just like this
is a little handheld mirror on there mix
it together and then it takes this brush
this is the Sigma II of 54 flat brush
and then once I've mix them together I'm
just gonna press them on toilet so
taking is just about that sort of size
on see like a little mixing tray and
it's same again and then just mixing
them together like that and then taking
the brush and pressing it on top
so this is the pink option obviously you
could go for a darker pink or a light
pink and still use those glitters
because we used a dark and the light
beam theater so it kind of gives you the
option to do whatever you want
both the glitters I used a really quite
finding mill so this one in particular
actually there's quite comfortable on
the lip I am obsessed with this trend
and I think these are these as such but
it's such a simple statement on the face
if you're going to take a festival or
something like that but yeah this is
just kind of one color I'm now gonna
show you lots of other different options
and it's still using the same process
every time so applying the lip balm I've
lined the shade of lipstick and putting
the clear glass on top and then mixing
the two glitters of choice together and
press them on the lip it's super easy
super super simple
and it makes such an impact in a
statement so I hope you like the rest of
the combinations and let me know in the
comments down below what is your
favorite one
so that is the finished tutorial I
really hope you guys enjoyed my
combinations and let me know it in the
comments down below or share with me on
Instagram if you guys recreate any of
them or come up with your own ones
obviously you can literally do any color
Under the Sun and then mix two or just
maybe one glitter or as many pieces you
want together as long as you have kind
of a clear glass you can use any
lipstick and any glitter combination and
you will have this desired effect make
