today I have kind of created another
look with glitter I feel like glitter
season is upon us with Christmas parties
and news and everything at coming up so
I'm feeling and loving the glitter
vibes at the moment and today I have
done this kind of dark eye look with
like a double liner going on using some
colored liner and some glitter and just
yeah just basically just having a play
with some color and new techniques so I
really hope you guys enjoy make sure to
give this video a thumbs up if you enjoy
it and subscribe if you haven't already
and definitely tag me if you recreate
this look you can totally mix up the
colors you could tell your parrot with a
red lip but I do plan to do kind of a a
video soon that's about about what
makeup to wear with a red dress and I
think that's going to obviously involve
like a red lips I kind of just member
the nude because I have done it to a
dark kind of lip tutorials consecutively
so yeah like I said I really hope you
guys enjoy this look and if you want to
know how to recreate it then please get
Ching gonna start with our eyes first
I'm at taking this Maybelline Color
tattoo in creme de rose which is the
most affordable and like the best dupe
for the Mac painterly paint-pot
and I didn't think you could get this in
the UK but I saw it in a boots the other
day so I will leave it linked down below
along with everything else and then I'm
going to go ahead and set that with
powder to make blending easier then I'm
just going to place some tape down at an
angle that I think kind of I'm aim
towards where I think my brow would end
when I do them just so that's the kind
of angle that I would like and then I am
going to go ahead and do my brows using
the benefit precise brow pencil in the
shade 4 and setting that in place with
the 3d at brow tones but eyeshadows I'm
going to use a makeup geek eyeshadows
today and this is chickadee it's a
really nice soft warm brown and I'm just
going to go ahead and buff that into my
crease with it my a Mac 2 to 4 brush and
having the tape there makes things it's
so much easier and you can be as messy
as you want and you know you're going to
get that sharp line so it's really good
if you're not 100% at confident then it
going back in with will not back in
we're going in with this shade here it
is a much kind of more brick-red
brownie kind of color and this is called
a Morocco and I was kind of using
stronger colors than I usually would in
the crease because we were going in with
a dark color on the lid so I didn't want
to lose the crease colors if that makes
sense and then just going back in with
the two to four brush not with any
additional product or anything just to
blend those two at crease colors
together then going in with a dark brown
shade this is maca I'm using a more
defined crease brush this is from Sigma
I have left a link to where I get my
brush from down below I always do and
then I'm it just using that to kind of
not define the crease as such by amat
well I guess you could say I am but I am
using it to be more precise with the
color placement concentrating it mainly
across the lid as in like above the lid
if that makes sense I'm I'm really just
rambling and in the outer part of my eye
this is what we're going to use for the
lid color it kind of looks the same as
one before but this one is called
bada-bing and it is a slightly darker
Brown I would say and it does have
reflexive gold in it they don't
necessarily pick up on the camera but up
close they do have some kind of girl
gold glitter in them so I thought that
was a nice touch I'm just using a small
shader brush just to pack that on to our
lid then it going back in with the
brushes as we always do not necessarily
with any additional product but like I
always say just to make sure all the
colors are blended together and there is
no harsh lines
then I'm just going to go ahead and
highlight in a corner and I'm just using
this shade from it the asleep
Cleopatra's kiss highlighting palette
because that's what I'm going to use on
my face and I just thought I would a
multi-use then I am going to line my
upper yeah I'm just going to apply a
winged liner but I'm going to make sure
that I keep it really thin just because
we're going to go in with a line on top
of that as well
so we don't want it to take up our whole
lid space so I'm just concentrating that
really thinly and close to our lash line
and not taking it out too far then going
in with this NYX Vivid's bright liner
I've left the name of it down below and
I'm just basically going above the line
that we just created and this is going
to be a base for our glitter so the
color really stands out and is more
bright and that you can sort of notice
it a bit more and this is the kind of
wing that you want to drag out and make
the biggest then I'm going to mix these
together together they're both from NYX
in the color copper and red and then it
using a small liner brush and some lash
glue and literally or first we want to
wait till that liner dries but then
you're going to literally go over the
red liner that you placed down and then
it using the same brush just place the
glitter over the top so you create that
glitter liner effect this is why I kind
of preferred using it tape because it
gave a really good guideline and it
allowed me it to be kind of a messy if I
needed to be instead of using my usual
technique of just using a wipe this just
made it a lot easier and the technique
of this I feel is actually quite easy
it's not too technical but it looks
really effective I would say and it
looks like you've put in loads of effort
and it kind of creates the perfect eye
look for like a Christmas party or
something if you want it to be a bit
different
then going back in with the eyeliner I'm
just going to tidy it up just because of
few bits of it do to kind of fell down
or and I definitely wanted to make sure
that it was a really crisp and sharp
line after I'd done the glitter so yeah
just going back in and just tracing over
where we originally placed the black
eyeliner and this one is from zoeva and
I will leave it linked down below I
think I wanted to use a pot liner for
this as in one was like a little dippy
pen so you can get these anywhere this
one's just from zoeva I just thought
this would be a lot easier instead of
using like a gel or something once
you're happy you can then remove the
tape and then as you can see you are
left with a clean cut sharp line of
glitter then you will go ahead and apply
mascara and lashes these are from a
blinking butte in the style Samantha
they have such a gorgeous wing it to
them so I thought it really complimented
the look onto the face I'm taking my
Nivea post shave balm as my primer and
just buffing that into my skin using my
Real Techniques and multitask face brush
the foundation today I'm using an old
favorite this is the Bourjois healthy
mix foundation I think it's in the shade
56 light bronze I'll have left the name
of it down below but this one it really
matched the color of my tan on my neck
so I'm just blending that and buffing
that into my skin and this brush is from
neve cosmetics
I love this foundation it gives us such
a gorgeous glow to the skin and then I'm
using this concealer from a cap on deep
this is her Lockett tattoo concealer is
super full coverage so as you can see
I'm only using like little dabbing
motions and then using a Beauty Blender
to blend it in just so this way it
absorbs any of the excess product and
doesn't leave too much kind of thickness
and heaviness on the skin especially
underneath your eyes because that can
cause creasing so I find it using a
Beauty Blender with this product to be
the best and for it to look the best as
well then I'm going to use this pen that
from Mac is the prep and prime pen in
the shade light just because the shade
of that Kat Von D concealer was actually
quite close to my skin tone and I really
wanted a bright under eye so I'm using
this in all the places that I really
want to highlight rather than it conceal
because this doesn't have a very heavy
coverage to it a lot of people think
that this is a kind of replacement as
concealer I suppose it could be if you
didn't want a full coverage and just
wanted that brightness but it definitely
doesn't have a very heavy coverage so
I'd like to use it on top of concealer
and again using it the beauty blender to
blend it all in just so it's not kind of
like sitting on the skin and everything
is as kind of lightweight as it can be
then you just want to go ahead and set
everything in a place with powder
because that was all the Korean products
that I wanted to use if you were going
to continue to use cream products then I
would wait and do them first but for
bronzer I'm taking another old favorite
this is the anartha goona bronzer you
can buy this individually this was just
in a holiday um was it a holiday at
palate that I got last year I don't if
they still do it but I definitely know
they will always do it NARS Laguna
bronzer separately so I believe I've
left that linked down below and taking
the deep throat brush I think this is um
from the palette as well just on a
blusher brush and applying that to at my
cheeks as well then going back in with
that Cleopatra's kiss palette I'm taking
the to powder highlighting shades on a
clean Mac 2 to 4 I love this brush for
highlighting the bristles are quite firm
so it blends it super nicely and evenly
onto the skin and I'm just applying that
to the top of my cheekbones and then on
my nose and my Cupid's bow to finish off
the eyes I'm going back in with that
Morocco shade it was the reddest shade I
love them all and I thought this would
tighten bringing it nicely with the
glitter on top of the eye so I'm just
running that along my lower lash line
and going in with a fluffy brush to
defuse and it smoked that out
then using this eyeliner from Mac this
is in the shade coffee it is a really
really dark brown really close to that
bada bing shade that we've used on our
lid but not as like harsh as using a
black so I really like to use Brown in
my waterline and yeah just running that
along my waterline and then kind of
diffusing the orange shade and the liner
together on a flat brush using this
brown shade I think this was
badda-bing that we used on the lid so
yeah just placing that between the two
and then using the same pencil brush to
diffuse that together as well then I
just applied a bottom eyelash mascara
and that is the eyes finished onto the
lips I'm at taking at Kylie's exposed
pencil just because it's more like a
orangie or warmer tone nude and I
thought that would complement the eye
look you could totally do a bright lip
with this either maybe brown or red or
something but I done a couple of dark
lip tutorials and I plan to do a few
more kind of red lip looks in the future
so I thought I would go up to my classic
nude and speaking of which I'm taking
this a Kat Von D it's studded kiss
lipstick in the shade
and then that's it I wasn't gonna I was
going to apply gloss and I thought no
Rachel there's a lot of glitter and kind
of like that kind of stuff going on on
the eyes let's believe it Matt for today
then just taking that two to four we
applied our highlight with and applying
it back to my Cupid's bow and just
around that area to finish off the look
so this is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you did
definite acne if you recreate it and I
will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
