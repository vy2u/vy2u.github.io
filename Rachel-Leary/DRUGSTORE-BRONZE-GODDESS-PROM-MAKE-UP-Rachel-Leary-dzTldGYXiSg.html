back to my channel so today another
problem of makeup doesn't necessarily
have to be prompted I know I whether to
look when I go out and I love it but it
is a bronze goddess blown-out smoky eye
totally can take the techniques in this
and use whatever colors you want this is
really good if you hate type doing
winged liner but want like a winged out
effect look going on there's no winged
liner involved but it's super blow now I
apparent it with a nude lip again paired
whatever you want this is just kind of
what I love to wear with this kind of
eye mater also I kind of like Emily
differently in which I'm kind of digging
I kind of want it to be like prom and I
do time to do some prom attire tutorial
so give this video a thumbs up if you
would like to see that video so yes this
is the home makeup look I created I
really hope you guys enjoy it doesn t
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
do and subscribe for future prom looks
so I love to see you in the next video
and if you are new I do this kind of
thing a lot so yes if you like to look
at this makeup look then please keep
watching okay so to begin I'm going to
go ahead and do my skincare best and yes
it's drugstore skincare tuned so to
begin I'm going to take the L'Oreal
extraordinary facial oil I love using
oil before foundations sometimes just
because I don't know super hydrating and
then it just makes everything apply it's
so much easier by I'm going to be using
a moisturizer and a primer as well
because it's prompt there's no holding
back and you want your makeup to look
the best that it can I'm just gonna
brush or bus that in to my skin I mean
after I would skin first today because
this I look I like to blow out and I
don't like today you can see or anything
to kind of sharp and I wanted to let
that out and I find it easier to do that
by gently skin first okay so now I'm
going to moisturize my skin and for that
I'm using the Gagne and moisture born
three and one invoice driver I at four
in love this stuff I'm going to pop that
on over the top for some extra moisture
my skin to be feeling dry throughout the
day or like my foundation to be feeling
tight or like my concealer to kind of
crease underneath haunted this video to
be kind of more chatty and personal
because I feel my other line and my
cameras are all hard she said I met
nails are adjusted and get ready with me
and inside I'm a did you tell them about
like your prom experiences and stuff and
also no I didn't like that I didn't
think to talk about that so let's talk
about it as I do Monica quit before we
do that I'm going to quickly pry my skin
at using the collection prime and ready
at primer and this is like powered by
witch hazel and fatigue and illuminating
so don't look tired want to be brighter
and it is all how about the skin today
because it's a good bronze god se look
we want to be illuminated and just
licking our best so I'm just going to
buff that in but yeah my problem with it
I have said my pre-prom which was cool
and I did my first prom a school we have
two problems one is like your year 11
before exams or the objects and
detectors before exams prom and then
argue 13 I believe is prom the year 11
prom is a bit of a disaster I don't know
that you need to go with anyone I didn't
go with anyone Mary asked me I didn't
ask them kind of just went with Murphree
em and then I mean really just hated
when I looked at it like I could do it
again now it'd be so different and then
the year 1300 may actually quite enjoy
their think because we're all old enough
to be able to just go out in town
afterwards which sons and I like glam
outfits enter at my outfit was more me
awesome we went to one more under the
skin or like under foundation product
I'm going to be using my L'Oreal True
Match liquid glow illuminator prime and
highlight and I'm just going to apply
this all over the skin there's I
actually bought in America and this is
why the packaging looks like this the
one in the UK I think it slightly bigger
but I'm just going to be applying there
the cheap all over my skin actually
apply this all over my skin it's like a
base globe it's so pretty they do two
colors if this one is recommended for
warmer to medium skin tones so you're
planning to get sprayed
something this will be really pretty
you're slightly on the paler side they
do a slightly more perlier one it's
probably best suited to your skin I'm
kind of confusing this brush to spread
it all around and then I'm just going to
use my sponge I'm going to use the
foundation just to press that and a bit
more there's anyone else let me know in
the comments down below I get like the
worst
I call it peach fuzz like all the sides
of my face which is just like it's
normal to have like a hairy face but now
I don't particularly want one so can you
get like the laser hair removal in your
face
I feel like that's something I want to
do okay so the base kind of before our
foundation is done now the foundation
I'm sorry it's I feel like this is
inevitable for me I am going to form a
beam at Matt and fit me a porter
foundation I freaking love this
foundation it lasts all day is a medium
to full like buildable coverage which I
feel like it's like perfect for prom and
it is for naught or your skin's it's
what I'm not finished it's going to last
a long time as well if you have slightly
dry skin like me that's why I went
through all that skin prep so this isn't
going to sit too tight on my skin so I'm
just gonna sponge that and and I'm in
the color 2 to 8 from reference again I
bought this bottle in America but it's
exactly the same product as the one that
we have just in the UK it's in a squeezy
tube I think but they did come up with
loads more colors in this range of
foundation so and I did a whole video on
it so I hope that you guys find one in
your shade and try out because for like
a drugstore foundation is honestly one
of my favorites of all time because
anyone else have any funny prom stories
one is really like I can't think of
anything like dramatic that happened at
mine or any drama or like anything funny
like my Preston break anything
if that did happen to you guys let me
know I want to giggle I loved reading
through your comments you guys telling
me your funny experiences and stories
okay so I feel about efficiently
efficiently sufficiently it blended in
to my skin now for concealer so I'm
gonna take a guarantee against ears but
this time I'm going to take
get maybelline camo concealer palette
i'm going to take the more like a medium
kind of shade which is this one here and
again i'm going to use this and i mean
it will be it lighter than my foundation
but i am kind of more using this because
it's a nice pink undertone to cancel out
the darkness that I have underneath my
eyes I'm just going to apply that with a
brush I'm also going to be using this to
like scope down my eyebrows as well it's
a really handy concealer palette to have
and you can see the concealers
themselves are super creamy and easy to
blend and also if you suffer from like
butt or like a lot of redness in your
skin it does come with a green one which
is perfect for cancelling out that
coloring but I'm just using this peachy
color to cancel out like blueness going
on underneath them as a no-bail layer
now gage got carried away and it's like
kind of too much I'm just going to blend
this i love the formula of this line if
you've never tried it maybe you should
go out and cover a little today i know
they do it to to shows maybe a bit like
a little feel like a like one in a
darker one i always get scared with like
creams in a palette and stuff to use the
monthlies my eye because they tend to be
slightly fuller coverage which is
obviously something that i love but they
can crease because they're full of
coverage on Moi's it huh I don't want to
use them underneath my eye because you
want to avoid that but these ones
actually blend out really well they kind
of work with the warmth of your skin I
find and just become so creamy I said
melt onto your skin and blend really
nicely okay so you can kind of see if
there's a little bit of roses going on
but not as much like one so I'm going to
go in with BM Maybelline a dreamy dreamy
well--there's country but Maybelline it
dream limit touch computers hand in the
shade ivory so that's really the light
and I'm just going to use this to
brighten up underneath my eye because I
was only using that other concealer to
like conceal so this is the one I'm
getting posting all around here these
are obviously extra extra steps to take
but it's prom I want to be a little bit
extra and also I'm just kind of showing
you a different range of product because
you might said this the other one and
all that stuff and also it might seem
like a lot of makeup but I use fun
to blend everything out which absorbs a
lot of like excess of the product so it
really doesn't feel heavy on my skin at
all I would never want myself or any of
you guys to feel like uncomfortable or
that you need a lot of makeup and all of
that you can see I really love that kind
of brighter effect under the eye
I always forget about this concealer I
love that Adri winder and the fit me
from Maybelline I always forget this
one's so pretty like so pretty
I mean I'm now done it'll like my cream
products so far so I'm now going to go
ahead and set everything in place so
that I'm taking the next row is it like
the highlight and contour kit and I'm
just going to mix and I'm just going to
use the yellow shade to kind of set
underneath my eyes and brighten my whole
tribe all actually I think I'm going to
mix the yellow and a slightly whiter
shade but kind of concentrating on the
yellow because yellow is really great
for brightening underneath the eye as
well
I'm just gonna press that here actually
going to use the mix of the two just to
kind of set everything in place I think
I'm going to continue with the skin and
then move on to the eyes so for bronzer
I'm taking the golden up rounding it
chocolate powder from a bourgeois this
smells so good yeah I can't even explain
so I'm just going to be using this kind
of likely bronze because then we are
going to contour but this is a really
gorgeous luminous glow to it I mean it's
like I said I know they move on to a
contouring after that I'm going to take
this street here it's a slightly warmer
one barely picking up any this palette
is pigmented especially the contour
shade says be careful
I'm just going to close that and then
buff up this is actually a next brush is
that brush in number 5 really good book
chipping out and contouring I am going
to take be like palest contour color and
I'm going to use that to at quantal my
nose totally optional if you don't need
to continue is don't do it I don't
necessarily need to I just feel like I
haven't in a while and I want to so I'm
taking there's a brush is from backstage
beauty is the eye blender kind of a flat
fluffy brush and just tiny
down with them oh and then once I do
that I just kind of press it in with my
sponge now on to blush your disposition
when my fave drugstore brushes to you I
think it's so pretty and so in this
messes up the colors in it
if the L'Oreal blush sculpt trio in the
color soft sounds I think is softer sand
and I'm going to try and avoid the white
shade because I doubt the country
highlighted for me I'm only using it to
the blush I'm going to dip my bra
blusher brush in the to end colors I
know you can see that the so pretty
such a pretty blush color okay I'm going
to highlight my skin last so I'm now
going onto my eyes I'm going to go ahead
and do my wrap-up camera as I literally
showed you how I did them in my previous
tutorial and I am using the same product
is the NYX micro brow pencil in ash
Browns I'm going to go ahead and do that
and then I'll be back to show you how to
deai I mean I'm back I've gone ahead and
done my eyebrows but I said I use V it
next micro brow pencil in the shade ash
brown and then I get back in it to my
Maybelline a concealer palette and use
the top middle shade 200 have it my brow
bone on to eyeshadow I'm taking via NYX
perfect filter actually pout in the kind
of style rustic antique look at these
colors they're like the most
warmest bronze yes amazing colors
perfect to this look so I'm going to
start off with this shape here as our
initial transition color I always start
and just stop me outer corner and I drag
it out and then buff it and I just kind
of back and forth and then her buff
upwards when I've got going less product
on the brush I said this is kind of a
blown out look so I am kind of driving
it out towards the end of my brow bone
as you can see like that then I'm going
to take this shade here which has a
little bit of a sparkle to it so so
Prius like a really like orange e
orangie peach color so I'm going to add
like the second color people at the
create actually I've got underneath my
eye as well again kind of creating that
blown-out winged look and I'm on a
slightly smaller brush to do this
because it wouldn't be more precise with
our move
noon but after this guys I'm off laughs
I'm uh I'm uh I gotta talk I'm off up to
London I think I need my hair colored
finally it's so overdue and the place
that I normally go my hairdressers moved
to goodbye so I can't go there so I'm
getting my hair colored at vixen and
blush which I'm sure you guys see on
Instagram or like had maybe people
talking about I am so excited I've never
been yeah just getting my hair colored
in publicity exciting all right you know
and it finally it's a deepen up actually
it's not finding that we won't want to
this I'm going to take the dark maroon
color on a again on a smaller brush and
just concentrate on that on the optimize
palm the kind of like you side-to-side
motions when I'm dragging it across the
litter so it that creates a better blend
and like a smoother transition moving on
to the lid color I am going to take the
it NYX vivid bright creamy shadow in the
shade and oh my god one of my favorite
cream shadows my favorite cream shadow
from my eyes personally you've got blue
eyes des I recommend trying out SV Kylie
calm Kylie copper cream shadow I love
that one this is a slightly more like
ready orange so again I still really
love this and you could totally wear
this on its own by I'm going to show you
that I put something over the top
but this is so pretty and they do the
loads of colors of these vivid bright
not sure if they're available in the UK
yet but obviously I have the audience of
UK and America so if I didn't use some
just American products be a bit annoying
for them so if you have blue eyes you
don't have this yet defo go and try it
out but yeah like I said they do loads
of colors like bright colors
they're also wearable ones as well like
then so a pretty I think but I am going
to go ahead and apply something on the
top and that is it be a berry a matte
bronze dazzle done and let's have a lock
pick I just want to be like a glitter
look rather than a full-on pigment so
I'm just going to tap a little bit off
and just lightly Pat that on top of
where we just placed the cream took a
kind of one
up and add a bit more yeah warmth to it
and a bit of sparkle Miami I did kind of
want it to be a bit more dramatic then
like some of the previous lips that I've
done because some people love to be
dramatic for prom so you know I'm going
to take the put the black please show
you from this palette but also mix it
with that burgundy color as well to
soften it just like a precise crease
brush and just concentrate that on the
outer most part of the eye just like
accentuate it just blending and passing
that all together
angled brush and mix those two colors
again together the black and the
burgundy press that on the top just to
like in the fourth the color and just
make it look a lot more smoky and sultry
and bronze gonna see my waterline you
guys I don't like adding it to your dark
I'm going to use B it NYX gold eyeliner
let me know in the comments down below
or give this girl a thumbs up if you
want to see a at like silver cool toned
dark look of the black in my water and
everything I know some people do
actually prefer that kind of look so let
me know run that in my waterline and
then going into that spot to you peach
shade the other side obsessed with
earlier we're going to run that along
our lower lash line and connect it back
up to this when we've got going on now
I'm going to go ahead and apply mascara
you guys know before we apply eyelashes
I'm just going to highlight my inner
corner for that I'm going to take the
two shades in this palette I'm just
going to mix them together oh hang on
this is just this color here I'm using
right now on its own I think I don't
need another one I don't want it to be
too white so okay I'm just going to use
that shade pretty I feel very like
speaking of which so lighter than many
use are very and these are the pinky
goat lashes in the style
Nora they look like this they are super
winged out they're not let that our once
they're slightly more like spiky ish so
I'm going to go ahead and apply these
now these are the eyes with the lashes
these lashes are actually is compared to
their other bright their other one
that are really sure and I kind of
wanted them to be sure so I wasn't
hiding any of the eye makeup 7h3 sass

the skin analyst what I'd like to do on
the skin is highlight which is not a
report I may take the literally it
