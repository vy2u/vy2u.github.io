as always I'm starting off with my brows
first and I'm using my soap &amp;amp; Glory brow
archery pencil in hot chocolate and
using the Loreal brow artist plumper in
light/medium to set then just because I
do my eyes first I'm giving my eyelids a
bit of color and just using the
foundation I'm going to be using and a
damp sponge just over my lid then as a
base I'm using the on and on bronze
Maybelline Color tattoo and using this
brush set from Coastal Scents which in
America I'm not sure if you can get from
your drugstore but it's at a drugstore
price and I'll leave the link to it down
below but I am so so impressed with
these brushes then using the glam
bronzer bronzer from L'Oreal on a fluffy
brush from the same brush set and just
buffing that into my crease
to further deepen my socket I'm taking
this dark brown shade from the Loreal a
nude palette I think in this one's in
the shade of beige using a smaller
fluffier brush from the same palette
this from the same palette from the same
brush there this brush is like 50
dollars I think from their website and
there is like so so many brushes in
there and none of them as from what I've
been using them have like flaked or
anything which sometimes you can get
from cheaper brushes so I'm seriously
impressed
then it taking this Maybelline the nudes
palette and again on the same brush
using a darker Brown to further deepen
the socket as usual to create that smoky
eye effect going back in with the
original fluffy brush but with no added
product and just making sure everything
is blended out seamlessly
you could just leave the bronze shade as
your lid shape but I wanted something a
bit lighter sorry I'm taking this berry
and dazzled us in the number 39 and just
pressing that on top of the base that we
put down
taking the sleek makeup highlighting
palette in the shade saliste
and making these two shapes together
this is going to be my inner corner
highlight and my brow bone highlight
because these the ones that I'm going to
be using on my face as well so it's nice
to kind of title together I've used
products like multi-purpose li 2010 you
guys know this is my favorite way to get
that clean cut edge of a smoky eye I'm
just taking a wipe and just cleaning up
any excess product so I get that sharp
edge that I can use as a base for my
wing
speaking of which I'm using my NYC
liquid liner as always is the best one
from the drugstore taking this thick and
fast mascara from soap &amp;amp; Glory love it
and then that one by the way and then
just applying a light coat of mascara
cuz we are going to be applying false
lashes as always I mean you don't have
to but you know I love them so much
taking this black eyeshadow from the
maybelline some nude palette on a
smaller denser pencil brush is kind of a
bigger pencil brush and just using that
to deepen the socket and make it really
smoky and then going back in with an
original blending brush that we used
earlier to really rough out and make
sure there's no harsh lines taking the
ardell lashes in the number one one
three and applying them as you know
you'd apply them I'm in love with you I
found on Amazon and they are amazing and
so wispy onto the face I'm using L'Oreal
Lumi magique primer and the Maybelline
matte and poreless foundation in the
shade 2 to 8 as you can see my neck was
already much darker than my face so I
did have to color match but everything's
ok it all matches you don't need to tell
me
I'm just buffing that into the skin with
a buffer brush from the set which is
incredible I had no brush hairs on my
face I'm in love with it then it taking
the collection 2000 lasting perfection
concealer in the shade fair I think is I
think it's their lightest one and
applying that under my eyes above my
brows down my nose and on my chin and
buffing that in with a real techniques
sponge and making sure that it is damp
as you guys know I love to cream contour
so I am taking this concealer in the
shade nutmeg from NYX and using this
kind of fluffy angled brush from the set
and applying that to all the usual
places that I would do so my cheekbones
the tops of my forehead and yeah then
I'm just going to buff that in with a
contour brush
I'm taking a technique that I got from
Shawnee grimmons most recent video in
her beauty hacks one because normally I
would bake my foundation my concealer
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
but I'm just taking this translucent
powder from Rimmel and kind of breaking
it up using the end of a foundation
brush and then applying it as you would
like it was a loose powder and it works
just as well so thanks to that one shiny
taking the same bronzer that we used
earlier this one is from L'Oreal and
just applying that basically to where we
applied the cream contour earlier
essentially just setting it in place
like you would any other cream products
on your face or what blusher I am taking
this Max Factor
I think this put like a cream puff
blusher in the shade new pub and just
apply that where you would normally
apply a blusher so on the apples of your
cheeks but taking it back just a little
bit so I don't know I just really liked
the look of when you take it quite high
up into a cheek and then I am
highlighting my cheekbones using the
same sleek palette that we used earlier
as well but just dig into this champagne
shade just applying that to the tops of
my cheekbones down the bridge of my nose
and on my Cupid's bow
to finish up the eyes I decided I didn't
really want to have anything to dramatic
going on so I'm just applying a light
coat of mascara and that is the finished
eye look
finally on tulips I'm taking this Rimmel
exaggerate lip pencil in the shade
addiction and just lining my lips and
overlying them the tiniest bit just
because - lightly and even the lipstick
I'm taking this Rimmel Kate Moss
lipstick in the shades are three story
it was upside down there and just
filling in my lips with it and making
sure it's all blended out into the lip
liner then for a gloss I'm taking this
one from la girl it's one of their lips
glaze paint in the shade whisper just to
lighten it slightly and add a bit more
shimmer and that is the finished look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this

more drugstore makeup so I really hope
