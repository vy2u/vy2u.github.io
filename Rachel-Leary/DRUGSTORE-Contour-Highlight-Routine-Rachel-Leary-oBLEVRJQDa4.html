see how I got from this to this using
all products in the drugstore then
please keep watching
so to prime my face I'm using a
hydrating moisturizer and my maybelline
baby skin primer to highlight I'm using
two concealers one is the collection mm
lasting lasting perfection concealer or
something in the shade fair but first
I'm applying my la girl concealer in the
shade creamy beige I think so I like to
layer my highlight because I feel it
looks more dimensional and this shade
has more peach tones in it rather than
the fair other concealer which is really
light so that concealer is going to
brighten whereas this is actually going
to do some conceal and adding coverage
so here I'm just applying the lightest
shade of concealer over the top for us
to blend out later to contour again I'm
taking two products which makes it look
a lot more natural and dimensional as I
said before those first I'm applying
this a thin foundation stick from NYX in
the shade cool pan and this is just
going to add a base to our darker
contour so we blend out it looks a lot
more seamless and it's not just this one
dark shade but so here I'm using the
Real Techniques foundation brush to add
the mix concealer I think this in the
shade almond but again it's already nice
warm shade and applying it over the top
is going to make it look a lot more
natural and when it's blended fizzle
to avoid having so many layers on my
face I'd like to add the foundation
afterwards this is the L'Oreal
infallible 24 hour foundation in the
shape 200 I'm using a crown stippling
brush to apply it that way using a
stippling brush is really going to share
out the product we have done a lot of
layering to the highlight and contour so
this way you are applying as minimal
foundation than you actually need and
this way you can use the foundation to
actually blend out the products rather
than using the products to blend into
the foundation which is when it can look
really thick and cakey
now at taking the Real Techniques sponge
I'm just using this to press my
highlight under my eyes into my skin
that way it avoids a bit potentially
creasing just because using a stippling
brush might kind of blend to product
around my face and not actually press it
into my skin and here I'm using the new
techniques contour brush to blend in my
nose contour is a totally optional step
I'm going back in with the Real
Techniques foundation brush and applying
the NYX almond concealer I'm just doing
this further deepen up the contour but
you don't have to I just felt like I
lost a bit of the color
now to cept everything I'm using the
Rimmel stay matte powder I think this is
the transition shade but it might be one
of the Palin ones but this is just going
to avoid any of the Queen's moving
around our face and just look everything
in place to contour I'm using the NYC
sunny bronzer and I'm using both these
brushes I've just used are from blank
canvas cosmetics so I will link them
down below there they're not from the
drugstore I feel like they are really
affordable brush
I've not yet found a highlighter from
the drugstore that I feel looks really
nice so if you guys know any please
leave them in the comments down below
but here I'm just using a Milani baked
eyeshadow and at using a brush sighting
I got from ebay like a long time ago but
it's really effective at just applying
the cutter and this one's a really nice
pale shimmery champagne shade so it's
not too intense when I'm just a pile is
above my brow bone and on the tops of my
cheeks I've just added some product
through my brows some mascara
and a bit of lip gloss I use the Too
Faced better than sex mascara and I'm
model Cove creme brulée lip lacquer but
that's everything I really hope you guys
found this informative and you learned
something new
please leave comments down below for
future videos you'd like to see the
until next time I'll see you guys soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
