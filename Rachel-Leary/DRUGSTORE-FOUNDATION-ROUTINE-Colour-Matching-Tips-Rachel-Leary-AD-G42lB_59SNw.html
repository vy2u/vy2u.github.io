you guys are following me on snapchat
you would have been seen I would sent
this incredible package from Maybelline
containing samples of their dream
assassin liquid and their Maps
Foundation and that is because they have
come out with so many new issues I think
it's 11 new shades of the dream satin
liquid and 12 new shades of the matte
and quarters foundation and you guys
know I love their foundation so today I
have teamed up with Maybelline to bring
you a video on obviously Amaya kind of
go it to occurring at drugstore
foundation routine but also some tips on
how to color match yourself as well
because I know that can be so difficult
and so many of you guys asked me
questions on it all the time so I
thought I would show you the tips that I
take when I kind of match myself so this
is part of the hashtag never settle
campaign with Maybelline so with all of
these new shades you never have to
settle for the wrong foundation again
everything I used is linked it down
below and I think that is a to the ten
pounds on Adrienne at the moment at
supercharge so it definitely checked
them out
maybe not also having a competition as
well I will explain it more of that at
the end of the video yeah if you like
the concept of this video and you like
the look of this kind of no makeup
makeup look all obviously or using
affordable Maybelline products then
please keep watching
so we're going to start off with a
completely clean phase of the Adamic
brows but skin lies completely clean
because we're I'm going to show you a
couple of tips on how to color match
yourself to a foundation so maybe we're
kind enough to send me a little samples
of all their new shades of the dream
assassin liquid foundation and the matte
and poreless foundation as you can see
this literally contains almost every
color certainly when I like to color
match myself to our foundation I'd pick
at least three shades one slightly
lighter than I think I might be one the
one that I think I am going to be and
then one is slightly darker this is
because foundations or like some
foundations tend to oxidize which means
as they're exposed to the open air they
get slightly darker or maybe even
slightly lighter it like it depends on
the formula of what they are so testing
3 for me kind of guarantee isn't going
to be able to find the perfect one also
when it comes to finding the color the
color you want to match it to is about
this color here now you're probably
thinking like well like why wouldn't
obviously be the one on your face but
that is for like a number of reasons
number one everyone washes their face
and exfoliates their face more than the
rest of their body so your face is
actually meant to be just all like
appears to be slightly lighter than the
rest of your body even if you don't take
time like me it's always just slightly
lighter also another reason is like I
just said if you take time like me if I
was just to match it to the color of my
actual skin I have like a really pale
face and a dark neck and that would just
look ridiculous we just kind of I always
say in my videos as to why I sometimes
wear and appearing at darker foundations
into I am it matches this color of my
neck which is how I want it to look and
also you don't want to match it directly
underneath your neck because when you
are faced on there is a shadow
underneath so that this part of your
neck is going to appear darker than this
part so visibly you just want it to
match the color of your net so I thought
I'd give you a little overview of the
foundations and their new shade so this
is the adream satin liquid foundation
and here it just tells you kind of like
or who it's best suited for the coverage
and the finish and they've come out with
11 new aides to try which is so exciting
ranging obviously from pale shades to
darker shades which is amazing and then
again they came up with 12 new shades of
it the fit me matte and poreless
foundation which you guys know I'm
obsessed
and this one is kind of best for normal
to oily skin it's a medium to full
coverage and it has a natural matte
finish recently I've been noting a much
more dewy finish so today I'm going to
like color match myself and use the
dream it's after liquid foundation so
from the colors here I feel like I kind
of fall into this category and I'm going
to go with one I think is slightly
lighter so I'm going to go for ivory I'm
going to go some nude which is the color
that I think I'm going to be and then
I'm going to take obviously one that's a
lot darker which is camel beige and I'm
just going to compare them and color
match myself to them so like I said
today I'm going to go with the
Maybelline Dream assassin addicted
foundation just because I kind of has a
normal to dry skin I've been loving a
dewy look animal medium coverage and you
guys will see me use the amount
important foundation hundreds of times
and I'm still super obsessed with that
foundation don't get me wrong so it's so
happy that they've come out with more
shape so so much more of you can try it
yesterday I'm going to be using it this
one I picked the shade ivory which I
think is going to be a little bit like
me nude which I think might be the one
that will be my kind of color and then I
picked caramel base just to double-check
and just make sure that it doesn't
lighten up on my skin so what I like to
do is little about three it swatches
down here and drag it down a little bit
onto my neck so this one is in the shade
ivory which is the one that I thought
was going to be slightly too light for
me this one is nude and then this one is
caramel beige now what I'd like to do is
kind of wait around 15 seconds if the
foundation for the chance to kind of
fully oxidized and you'll get to see the
real color that they'll be on your skin
so I'm just going to go ahead and wait
15 seconds so after we've given that the
foundations kind of time to oxidize and
see their true color I feel like they
all got a tiny bit darker which is good
which is why you want to go for a
slightly lighter one and then obviously
you can just rule out the one that you
thought was going to be too dark anyway
so as I thought the shade nude I think
matches me it really welds like towards
the bottom of my neck obviously this one
is just slightly too light and that
one's really dark that's for me on my
more tanned days do I feel so now you
can just wipe them away and you can get
to applying your perfect shade so I'm
just going to head in at prime
skin before foundation obviously at
priming our skin makes such a difference
in terms of the longevity of your
foundation again that is another thing
is that you want to definitely read like
the labels and the key qualities that it
has for example if you've got oily skin
you might want to go through the more
matte foundation and then look for a
primer that has oil control in it and
stuff like that therefore you're going
to get the most out of each product so I
kind of match myself to the Maybelline
Dream satin liquid foundation which is
in the shade nude and this is like I
showed you earlier this has more of a
curious finish so definitely love this
one around this time of year and also
have more than medium coverage knowing
the coverage of the foundation as well
means you have know how much to disperse
onto your face because this one that
said it was medium I'm only going to go
for one pump on either side and then
just see how it goes in terms of
applying it I either love you buns or
kind of like a kabuki brush so I'm just
going to go ahead and Pat that into my
skin so as you can see this is slightly
darker than my facial skin tone right
now but I think it matches really really
nicely it's the color of my neck and my
can so that is the kind of end result
that you want to go for and I always
feel like it's good to just start off
with a minimal amount of foundation on
the face and then you could always add
it's so much easier to add more than it
is to it take away loads of you guys
always tweet me about finding your color
and the tips to do that so if this video
is handy and especially since I read
about these foundations all the time I
always want you guys to be able to use
and so did is now at my skin with that
foundation on as you can see in my tree
nicely to the color of my neck and it's
a really really gorgeous finish and
coverage as well if you have normal to
dry skin like me the dream of satin
liquid is such a beautiful foundation
and I've only recently rediscovered my
love for us I've always been using more
matte foundations and like the colder
months but a little bit once you've done
like one there if there's certain areas
of your face that you're more insecure
you like a little bit more coverage then
I feel like you can go ahead and just
apply a little bit more just to those
areas so if for me I'm just going to
take a tiny bit more on my finger I
always say it's just always around here
I just like to add a little bit more
coverage
so that is the foundation done I really
hope my color matching tips at the
beginning made sense and were helpful my
first tip was obviously to pick three
shades one being one that you think
you're lighter than one not being the
one that you think that you are and one
being one that's slightly darker second
of all you want to know where you're
kind of matching to like I said you want
to do it to kind of discolor of your
neck it might be the same color as your
face if you don't hand like me but
everyone like I said always has a
slightly like to say so just bear that
in mind and also and let it oxidize for
at least 15 seconds just assume that see
it the 'true color of the foundation and
what it's going to be so you're not
going to have to go back and return it
or anything so you never have to settle
for the wrong foundation again even
though this is just a foundation routine
I'm going to go ahead and finish off my
face using at my favorite Maybelline
products so I'd already done my eyebrows
but when I do my eyebrows first and my
foundation second my eyebrows will come
off a little bit so I am just going to
go over them real quick using it the
Maybelline a brow precise brow fiber gel
and this one is in the shade medium
brown so I'm just going to go ahead and
brush that through this just kind of
helps to it sticking up the brows and
just set them all in place so if you
have naturally it stick rao's this will
be a brilliant nice product just to
quickly brush through because it does
obviously have a little bit of color to
them then it's a concealer I am going to
use my favorite age rewind concealer and
this is in the shade light to give me a
little bright under eye and literally
nearly at the bottom of this I just like
to apply that in an upside down triangle
kind of just down the center of my face
and now I'm just gonna run that in with
this sponge you can see it the
foundations are considered together
gives like such an amazing coverage if
you don't like a massive if you don't
like a huge amount of coverage
definitely recommend this foundation but
maybe try their loony Lumi touch
concealer that one's a pretty nice one
just for a little bit of brightening
underneath the eye if you don't want
anything too drastic so once that is all
applied you can go ahead and it set it
with powder and then you can apply the
rest of your face makeup I feel like
such a blank canvas right now but to
warm up my skin I'm going to take the
Maybelline brics bronzer in the shade
0-1 blunts I'm just going to start off
with the bronzing side just to warm up
my complexion
I feel like you're quite fair this is a
brilliant knife runs of you because it
is really really soft in color and it's
formulated to really complement people
would slightly lighter hair and fair
skin to the color isn't too drastic
either I do want a slightly and more
chiseled cheek so I'm just going to use
my Maybelline master sculpt and take
this shade here this one is the light to
medium shade and just close that
underneath kind of where we put the
bronzer just for a slightly more defined
cheekbone so blush I'm going to dip back
in it to at the bronzing side and just
take this pot here I'm pretty sure this
is like a highlighter but it has pinky
shades in it too so I thought this would
be kind of like the perfect mix I'm then
going to take one of my favorite
products this is the Maybelline a strobe
stick in the shade medium nude I love
this just really quickly put it on at my
finger and then dab it on the tops of my
cheekbones so that is the skin finish so
now I'm just going to really quickly add
a nude lip and this is the Maybelline
matte nude lipstick in the shade in the
shade 91 if you guys for my snap with
swatches and in love this color it's
going to pop that into my lips I'm just
going to go ahead and apply mascara and
this is the Maybelline the falsies angel
push-up mascara
I think things just going to only apply
to the top because this is obviously
like a skin focus video and sometimes I
like just I think it makes more of an
impact if you just have your top lashes
with something on so this is the
finished look as you can see I feel like
my foundation that matches to at my skin
tone perfectly which has been made so
much easier since like I said Maybelline
have come out with 11 new shades of
their dream session liquid and it's 12
new shades of their matte and poreless
foundation so just about everyone should
be able to find it that perfect shade
but this is a super minimal easy look to
do super affordable as well and what's
amazing is that superdrug have an offer
on with maids included sometimes on
maybe at the moment which is amazing and
in celebration of this amazing a new
kind of color range launch and as part
of their hashtag it never settle
campaign they are giving you the chance
to win a Maybelline a goodie bag if you
post your new foundation on Instagram
