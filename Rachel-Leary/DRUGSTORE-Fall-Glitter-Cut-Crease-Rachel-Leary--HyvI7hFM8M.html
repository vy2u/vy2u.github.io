completely fresh to face because we're
going to be doing kind of like a wing
look and I find it so much easier just
to clean up after myself if I haven't
done my base first we are going to go
ahead and do our eyebrows first and
without we're going to use the soap and
glory brow archery in hot chocolate and
the Maybelline brow precise fiber
volumizer in deep brown I'm going to go
ahead and do my eyebrows off comedies
because everyone does their differently
and I plant you an eyebrow routine quite
soon see let me know in the comments
down below if you want to see that so
I've just gone ahead and filled them in
with a pencil and now I'm just going to
go in with the Maybelline product this
one's really good if you have kind of
thinner brows like me just because it's
got fibers in it so it gives the
appearance of like a thicker brow and
also set some in place I really like to
concentrate this through the front and
kind of brush up and then brush the
excess now I'm kind of in the mood for
quite like a sculpted glam brow so I'm
going to take my NYX full-coverage
concealer in the shade zero three to
scope out underneath and then lightly on
the top and to do that I'm at taking a
Sigma F 70 consumer I take a little bit
on my brush you want to concentrate it
just where you want the brightest point
to be so that's tends to be under the
arch and then you just kind of take the
excess this side then you can drag it
down
then just taking like I said a little
bit um along the top and in the mood for
a glam brow today so with both eyebrows
now it sculpts out I'm going to go ahead
and apply my eyes and to do that I'm
going to be using the Maybelline Color
tattoo in the color creme de nude and
I'm just going to go ahead and use my
Sigma firm blender e-40 for just to
apply that this is such a good dupe for
the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot it's like
exactly the same color and I find it to
work just as well as well you can see we
are going a glam today prepping for the
gourds honey and then obviously you can
blend your concealer into that as well
once you've primed both eyes you can set
them in place with a powder I'm just
going to use the face powder that I plan
to use which is the Rimmel clear
complexion check blue clear complexion a
translucent powder and now I'm just
going to go ahead and do it one eye off
camera because I'm actually not hundred
sure what I want to do yet and then I'll
be back to show you how I did it okay so
to begin we are going to take the sleek
I define palette and this one is in the
shade on the horizon you're just going
to take this color here and this is
going to be our initial transition color
so I'm just kind of concentrating this
above my crease it doesn't matter so
much we do get it down a little bit
we're going to clean it up with our the
Maybelline Color tattoo that we used to
prime our eyes so this is a way that two
to eight Lux crease brush and like I
said just in windscreen wiper motions
just concentrating that above our lid
into our crease you do kind of want to
take it quite high because it's going to
be our initial transition color and
we're going to be applying dark colors
underneath so you still want it to kind
of like peep through like that is then
for the next color I'm just going to
take the bronze that I plan to use and
this is the L'Oreal gran bronzer in the
shade
zero two and yeah just using that as our
second color to further define the
crease and I am just taking a Mac two
one seven to do this bronzers make such
good crease colors if they're
particularly quite warm because this is
quite a warm look we're going for I
thought why not then going back in with
this away the brush with no extra
product on just blending them together
again it take another sleek palette this
is such a gorgeous everyday palette this
is the eye divine palette in a new day
I'm just going in with this dark brown
color here and this is when you can
start to really define your crease I'm
going to just take a pencil brush this
is a sigma e30 pencil brush and just
concentrate this right into your crease
like I said doesn't matter if it comes
down onto your lid so much because we
are going to clean that up but little is
definitely more because it's better to
be able to build it up because it's much
easier to build it up then to take it
away so just pressing really lightly it
also helps to look down as well just
kind of the basic outline that we want
like that and then it's almost just like
doing one big reverse so I'm now taking
a two hundred the bronzer and it's just
using it that to blend that line then
again with the de leyva brush like so
then I'm actually going to take that two
one seven and dip it in that bronzer and
the dark brown color that we use on the
pencil brush and just really use kind of
back and forth motions just to soften
that out a little bit more
then you just kind of want to repeat
those steps until you're kind of happy
we are going to further define it after
we have pried the lid color but just so
you can see it so I'm going to kind of
leave it like that then I'm going back
in with the color tattoo and we're going
to use this to kind of sculpt our group
we're going to use this to kind of
sculpt out the crease and give ourselves
a really really good face to only apply
our lid colors so on a Luxy q13 brush
pick up the eye base and you could use
the NYX concealer that we used earlier
to do this or ever I base that you've
used just something that's kind of like
a plain color stretching out your eye as
well really helps just to kind of make
the skin tight this is why I said it
doesn't matter so much you get kind of
shadow on your lid because we are
cleaning out like that for our lid color
I'm at taking it this a berry em
dazzled us in the color bronze I
literally found this in a soup drug the
other day and I'm obsessed I it's such a
gorgeous bronze color and we're just
literally gonna pack that on the top of
well just applied that product and I'm
doing this with a I think this is a two
to eight brush from Mac one of the
little ginger ones I'm just kind of
looking down and then packing it on I'm
obsessed with this color it's so nice
these kind of colored pigments are my
absolute babe and then now this is kind
of just like a little bit of going back
and forth and just really define the
crease however defined legally that you
want it so I'm just taking that pencil
brush just kind of tracing over the top
just kind of buffing that in then go
back in with my fluffy brush
like so and now is the exciting part is
time for glitter so I'm going to be
mixing these two it.next glitters is in
the color zero five and it's zero for
one is more of that kind of classic
copper color and the other one is a bit
more of a gold just because this lid was
kind of not too gold it was a two copper
so I thought I'll mix them together and
create my own so for glitter adhesive
you can literally just use eyelash glue
from the drugstore so I'm just going to
apply the glue using this Sigma shader
lid a 56 brush and just press this loop
just where we applied the lid color so
just applied the glue like that and then
taking this Coastal Scents er cs20 brush
which is literally just like a little
flat brush I am mixed my glitters
together just a little tray I'm just
going to press them onto the glue again
looking down will help make sure the
glitter doesn't transfer then you go
really pack it on up to the crease this
is why I do my eyes first so once you're
happy with the amount of glitter that
you've got going on you can now go back
in and further define your crease
because as you can see we're not lost
Caprice but it could just do with a
little bit further definition so I'm
just going to be going back in with my
pencil brush and also a little brush
like this this is the Sigma flat definer
brush and that's going to really help
define our crease as well so I'm just
going back in with a dark brown from
that sleek palette that we've been using
this whole time then going back into
that other sleep palette that we used
for the initial transition color I'm
just going to take this shimmery black
shade and just use that on that flat
definer brush to further deepen up our
crease so like I said less is always
more so I only kind of dabbed my brush
in slightly then I'm gonna use a little
back-and-forth strokes that way we're
not applying too much
and it kind of helps to avoid mistakes
there just going back in with the plaza
brush blend it out now time to clean up
the mess I'm just taking a wipe oh I'm
wiping up all the glitter from
underneath my eyes and then just kind of
wiping it towards the tail of my brow so
now we have a good base and a clean wing
for doing our winged liner for winged
liner I'm going to take the maybelline
at Brad precise in Forest Brown so not
quite black but it's a really dark brown
I thought that'd just be something a
little different instead of your classic
black wing and I think Brown around this
time of year it's really flattering and
it will tie in with the lip that we do
so if this is anything like this one I'm
going to go ahead and do this off camera
just because it kind of requires a
little bit of faffing and I'm probably
gonna end up going really far down I do
have a winged liner tutorial I always
think it down below it's the same
concept obviously I'm just using a
different product if there was a brown
gel liner I'd probably recommend using
that but this is the only kind of brown
liner I had from the drugstore so I
finished doing my eyeliner now and now
I'm gonna just apply mascara mascara I'm
taking the L'Oreal voluminous fatale I
think is in black and then it's
obviously not a glam look without power
lashes and these are the 0:09 from eye
candy the super wispy see but fluttery
so perfect this look this is what the
eyes look like with mascara and lashes
on now onto the face we'll come back to
the under eyes in a minute okay so the
skin I'm going to be mixing my NYX angel
veil primer together and the NYX liquid
illuminator in pure gold if you watched
my previous videos you know I really am
into mixing my primers with liquid
illuminators at the moment just because
it gives a bit more color to the skin
and it kind of gives your be nice at
below from underneath I'm going to take
my Real Techniques multi-task brush I
always get that wrong and it just buff
that in as I normally would with my
primers
for foundation I'm going to be a taking
the Bourjois healthy mix foundation in
the shade 56 light bronze this is a
really nice foundation if you would like
quite a dewy finish and kind of like a
medium to buildable coverage buff that
and I'm just going to take my blank
canvas cosmetics f28 flat top kabuki
brush I'm just going to press that into
the skin and then buff it in thing that
I love about boar to our products is
that they smell so good like the
chocolate bronzers this foundation
smells really nice as well then let's
for concealer I'm going to take the
Maybelline Dream Lumi touch pen
concealer in the color 0-2 nude just
kind of applying this underneath my eyes
this actually has a quite a full
coverage and you can use it via brush to
really sharpen up your wing you can just
drag it down
and then I'm just going to take my Real
Techniques sponge to blend that in the
cream at contour I'm going to take the
Maybelline and master sculpt and just
concentrate the product sort of on the
more tan side and this is in the shade
medium 0-2 then I'm just going to take a
duo fiber brush to blend that in and
this is just like a a Mac 130 brush I
really like this as a cream contour it's
not too warm and it definitely has kind
of cool undertones to it so actually
looks like a really natural contour cos
creams tend to look the most natural
anyway just because they blend in a bit
better
once I've applied all the creams that
want to apply to my skin I'm just going
to go ahead and set it using the remote
clear complexion a translucent powder
once that's all set in place I am just
going to go ahead and go in with the
bronze that we used earlier as that
unknown and the lip as an initial
transition color this is the l'oreal
grap glam bronzer n02 and i'm not so
much gonna use it to define more just
kind of add a little bit wants to my
skin so see we kind of cream contouring
that adds a little definition for us and
this is a Mac from 135 and this is like
my favorite brush to apply bronze if you
just want it to be it's really soft for
blusher I am going to take this let me
open it this NYX on very brush blush in
the color soft flush it is a really
gorgeous peachy color I think that's
gonna be it tied in with all the colors
that we use on the eyes I find these
blushes to be really pigmented so I make
sure I'm just kind of like dabbing it on
my face so I don't dispense too much
then for my highlight you guys know I'm
obsessed with this at the moment is the
sleek Cleopatra's kiss a highlighting
palette and I'm going to take this color
right here just because I think I want
to applies the nicest I'm just going to
use my morphe m51 one brush to do that
this is honestly one of the like burst
higher arch as I've used and the fact
that it's from sleek and from like the
drugstore and it's at such
portable prize is amazing so that is the
skin complete we're now just going to go
ahead and finish off the eyes so if it
underneath my eyes I'm rich going to
take the bronzer that we used earlier on
a pencil brush and just run that along
my lower lash line for a little inner
corner highlight I'm going to take the
highlighting color that we used from the
the Cleopatra's kids palette and then
just apply that in my inner corner and
then just going to take the same mascara
we used as well and just apply some
mascara to my lower lashes so this is
the finished eye look I mean she's so so
happy with the way that came out and now
it's time to decide what lip you want to
go for now I think this is kind of the
good thing about warm tone alerts and
why they're so popular cause literally
any lip that you pair with a warm tone
look tends to go but because I use kind
of brown tones and it's a kind of a
classic fall look I am going to go ahead
and do a brown lip I wore brown that
previously and those of you guys liked
as well so that kind of inspired me to
do one again this time I'm literally
just going to take a lip liner this is
the Max Factor color elixir lip pencil
in the shade brown and bold I'm just
going to take this color all over my
lips and use it as my whole lip color
because I actually can find a matte
Brown lip stick or liquid lipstick from
the drugstore there might be a NYX lip
lingerie but I kind of want to mix it up
a bit in terms of brands in this video
and all the other kind of brands I saw
we're really like perfectly brown or
like wine kind of color once you've gone
ahead and done that I'm just going to
tidy up slightly with concealer but that
is the finished look so this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys like it I know it's kind of like a
classic makeup look like warm eyes and a
brown lip but I thought I would just get
the ball rolling with something I
thought loads of you would enjoy and
appreciate considering it was all using
it drugstore products make sure to give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and Devon
tag me on instagram if you recreate this
look as well make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and subscribe if you
haven't already and obviously I do have
a selection of ideas myself but let me
know in the comments down below any
other fall looks that you'd like to see
for me or just for videos in general
yeah thank you so much for watching and
until next time I'll see you soon bye
