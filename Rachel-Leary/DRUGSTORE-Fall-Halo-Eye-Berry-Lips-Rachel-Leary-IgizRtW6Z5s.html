today in amongst all the Halloween and
madness I wanted to keep up with the
automat makeup looks and today I have
created this makeup look right here and
that you would have seen in the intro
using in the newest sleek rockstars
collection this video is in
collaboration with sleek you guys know
I'm obsessed with them I've done videos
with them before and you guys seem to
love their stuff as much as I do so I
always love showing you their new
collections and the way that I would
wear them or just kind of like an idea
of how to wear them and pretty sure that
this kind of half of the rockstars
collection will be exclusive to of boots
from the 26th of October this rock stars
collection it contains some more of the
bronzer kind of softer pinkier tones
with a more of a pink earlier that is
another half to the collection it is
more jewel tones and a darker lip and
now on is exclusive to super drunk as
well but all will be available from its
lucam from the 26th so you can check out
the whole collection there so I decided
to create kind of like a halo eye type
look obviously with a bold berry lip
which I'm obsessed with it's not just
kind of good everyday berry it's a
really cool it's got like a reflex of
silvery blues running through it so I'd
wanted to match that with the eye as
well you guys have seen that I shadow
palettes and then lip sticks before you
guys know they're amazing but also in
this they have a new product two part of
their range it is their strobing at
souffle and as you can see it gives you
the most incredible highlight so I can't
with you guys to see this tutorial make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you enjoy
it and check out the links down below
for any of the products that you wanna
buy yeah without further ado let's get
started you can begin with your face and
eyebrows already done and then I'm gonna
take the a new day I divine eyeshadow
palette in this medium brown shade and
on a fluffy brush concentrating this
mainly on the outer portion of our eye
because it's a halo eye you want to kind
of concentrate this elite outer part
buff it across just slightly and then on
the inner corner as well
from the same eyeshadow palette I'm
gonna take this dark brown shade on a
slightly smaller fluffy brush again it
concentrate this on the places we just
placed that original color but not
necessarily dragging it across because
we wanna focus mainly on the inner and
the outer parts and just pressing it
lightly and just using little buffing
motions we are just yeah like I said
placements in the inner corner and the
outer corner and then you can go back in
with your fluffy brush to make sure it's
all blended out together and there's no
harsh lines this palette is perfect for
every day the colors are so so so
wearable so I love this one taking the I
lust diamonds in the rough palette and
this shade here I'm obsessed with this
one
these ones are almost like highlighters
as you'll see in a minute as well we are
just taking it the kind of softer
champagne II color and placing it right
in the middle going in with this shade
here this is a slightly bronzer shade we
are using this as a transition between
the darker colors and that light
champagne color to make sure everything
is blended it seamlessly then just going
back in with a fluffy brush to make sure
everything is blended together as best
as I can and going in with this light
gold color here using that to highlight
our inner corner this one is so nice for
like a highlighting color so at this one
this palette almost that doubles up as a
highlighting palette as well then I just
went ahead and applied mascara and
eyelashes and then we go ahead and clean
up our under eye with concealer and set
it with powder going back in with the
original color we are just basically
gonna mimic the action we did on the top
on the bottom so going in with that
medium brown shade in the inner and
outer corner then going in with that
champagne color from the I lust islands
in the rough palette and just placing
that in the center as well as you can
see just concentrating this literally
mirroring what we've done on at the top
then going back in with that dark brown
again just on a pencil brush and on the
very very outermost parts of our lower
lash line
then I went ahead and applied mascara
and this is the finished eyelook to
finish off the face I am at taking it
the sleek makeup face format palette in
the shade medium and take me the
shimmery bronzer shade I'm just using
that to warm up the parameters of my
face as always on a smaller fluffy brush
I am it taking the mattes of bronzing
shade and I'm just gonna use this to
contour and define up my cheekbones you
can see it makes such a difference when
you've just bronzed and then comparing
to bronzing and the contouring I think
it just simply it Slim's your face and
gives you such like more defined
cheekbones I've been at loving doing
this at the moment then I'm going in
with one of their new products this is
the strobing souffle I'm taking a little
stippling brush this one is called pink
opal and it's a slightly Pinker cooler
tone once a match the eyelet we're going
for as you can see oh my god I am
obsessed sibling onto the skin I found
to be the best way and then I went on
top with the I lust palette and on a
fluffy brush just kind of used one of
the colors to intensify that highlight
and as you can see so intense I'm
obsessed with this combination then to
finish off the look I'm going in with
the lip but VIP in the color scandalous
to kind of finish off this full look so
this is the finished makeup look I'm
obsessed with how it came out I really
hope you guys enjoyed it make sure to
