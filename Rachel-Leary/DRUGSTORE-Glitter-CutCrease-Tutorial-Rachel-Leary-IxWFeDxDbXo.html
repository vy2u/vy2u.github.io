today I filmed this silver cut crease
lip that I posted on my Instagram a few
days ago I think and a lot of you said
that you did want to see tutorial on it
I created this using all products from
the drugstore so there's going to be
really easy to get your hands on and it
didn't actually take me that long either
so it's quite quick as well if you like
the look at this look then please keep
watching also I don't know you're gonna
be able to notice but I got new hair
it's still blonde and everything but I
got rid of my braids and it's a bit more
ashy oh it's a lot less yellow so let me
know if you like it and give this video
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it as well
yeah let's just get into it
Mac so first of all I'm gonna start by
applying tape that way because we're
using glitter and stuff like that if
there's any fallout it's just my land
onto the tape and when we peel it away
we're going to be left with a really
crisp sharp line next I'm going to be
applying my eye shadow base this is the
skin color one from NYX I'm just going
to be patting that all over my lid just
using my finger next to create the cut
crease I'm using this brown gel eyeliner
also from NYX and an eyeliner pencil and
as you can see I'm just drawing a dark
line into the crease you don't have to
be too careful with this because we are
just going to blend it out as you'll
soon see
I'm then just going back in with the gel
liner again just to further deepen up
the crease next to blend it out I'm
using the NYC sunny bronzer and this is
just gonna act as the kind of Middle
transition shade as we're kind of
working in woods to outwards instead of
normal when we would go outwards to
inwards and to create the lighter shade
I'm just using this golden eyeshadow
from the NYX next to prime my lids again
I'm using this NYX jumbo eye pencil in
milk just to act as a white base for me
apply the glitter on the top
and to set the pen so I'm using the
matte white shade from this remote trio
tree
I think it was a trio but yeah just any
white matte eyeshadow look new then I'm
just going back in with my crease brush
again just to create a sharp line now
for the glue and the glitter I'm just
using an eyelash glue pressing that all
over my lid waiting for it to get just a
little bit tacky and then pressing the
glitter over the top
however feeling disc elitist actually
meant your nails but because it was on
myself I didn't really mind and then I'm
just going in with a very Emma dazzled
us over the top to make it more glittery
and sparkly and then again just further
deepen the crease with the gel liner
from the beginning now up for eyeliner
i'm using the maybelline is it blackest
black gel liner and i'm quite proud of
myself because normally I go redoubt
focus on doing eyeliner but today I
managed to keep it all in a few guys but
I just sped it up it took me ages but
doing a gel liner over glitter I felt
was the easiest just because it's
retexture so I went over it with gel
liner and then to set the gel liner I
used a matte black eyeshadow just to get
rid of any of the glitter on the liner
hello how many times I just say liner
now just apply your favorite drugstore
mascara this is Maybelline the falsies
and then it's time to take off the tape
now to clear up the excess glitter on my
face I'm just taking this L'Oreal
eyeshadow or eye makeup remover now to
prep my skin I'm using my yes to
moisturiser and my Maybelline Baby skin
primer and the foundation I'm using the
l'oreal infallible in the shade 200 and
just buffing that in with a real
techniques buffing brush as I just
showed you my neck is totally different
color to my face so I do have to have a
darker foundation you don't have to tell
me
now to highlight and conceal I'm using
my la girl Pro concealer and my natural
collection concealer I think the natural
collection one is the palest one and the
la girl one is in the shade natural I
don't know I know you probably can in
America but you can't actually get the
la girl concealer in like boots or super
drug in england but you can get on
Amazon for really cheap so it's kind of
like an affordable makeup tutorial as
well now I just set my skin with the NYX
HD powder and I'm just bronzing my skin
again at using the NYC bones that we
used in the crease our using this summer
of love boxed kind of shimmery bronzer
to highlight this is from makeup
revolution and I have it three of these
and they are beautiful
back to the under eyes I'm taking the
NYX gel liner that we have been using
throughout the tutorial I'm just putting
that on my waterline and just slightly
below it blow it below it as well and
then smudging it out with a pencil brush
because this gel liner is so creamy it's
so easy to smudge and blend and create a
really smoky under-eye look and then to
further blend out I'm using the NYX
golden shadow that we use Valley in the
crease as well then go ahead and add
some bottom lash mascara and some lashes
these are the ardell demi wispies they
just have a slight cat eye to them which
I really liked because of the whole cat
eye look we're going for
now the lips this is the NYX nude beige
lip liner and it's such a dupe for the
Mac strip down liner as well and then
this is a lipstick from makeup
revolution and I can't remember the name
and then I'll put it down below ver then
this is the sleek gloss in angel falls
and yeah that's it I really hope you
guys liked it and let me know else you
want to see in the future but until next
time I'll speed you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
