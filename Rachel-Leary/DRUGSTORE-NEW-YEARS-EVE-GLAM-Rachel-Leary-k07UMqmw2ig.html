today I have created this makeup look
it's kind of a classic look for me
but this time I've used all products
that you can get from like it boots or
super drug or the drugstore they're all
super super affordable so I just kind of
wanted to create like a really intense
glam look kind of perfect for Christmas
like the holiday party season type thing
I know that's kind of what a lot of
these looks are at the moment but I know
they're in demand and people keep
wanting new ideas see I just kind of
want to show you can get that intense
land look but you don't have to break
the bank to do so yeah I really hope you
guys enjoy this makeup look make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you do definitely
attack me on instagram if you recreate
it at Rach Larry all my social media
handles are down below and make sure to
smell bitter to subscribe if you haven't
already and let's get on with the toot
deploy my eyes I'm going to take the
soap &amp;amp; Glory kick-ass concealer and just
kind of mix the two colors together and
blend them all over my lid and set them
in place with the powder that it comes
with and then for the eyes I'm using
this amazing palette from NYX it's their
like beauty school dropout palette I
think so good it comes with face
products as well but I'm just taking
this light brown shade on a fluffy brush
and just blending that into my crease
devided deepen the crease I'm taking
this warm brown shade on a slightly
smaller fluffy brush and just keep
concentrating that like into my crease
just to kind of create that gradient and
then kind of taking it onto the lid
slightly but concentrating that mainly
on the outer part of my eye then I'm
taking this slightly more plummy shade
again placing that onto the lid and then
buffing that into the crease to give it
a bit more depth and definition as well
I always when it comes to a really glam
smokey eye I love to use at least like 3
or 4 different shades of brown and black
then going in with this champagne cream
eyeshadow this is from Maybelline I'm
pretty sure some of their color tattoos
and I've left the name of everything
down below and I'm just using that as a
base before I go in with another product
but I'm just making sure to diffuse the
kind of line between the shadow and the
cream so it's all blended together then
I'm taking this gorgeous champagne gold
like dazzly glitter dust from Barry M
again
I've listed it and linked it down below
if you want further details and I'm just
pressing that on the top and then going
back in with my fluffy brushes to make
sure everything is really diffused
together taking it these two shades
because I didn't want it to be too harsh
on a smaller actually I think it's
almost a bit firmer so it placed the
product a bit more heavily that makes
sense I'm using that with this darkest
shade and just creating that smoky
transition onto the lid and into the
crease and then obviously going back in
with my initial fluffy brush to make
sure everything is all blended together
then I'm going to highlight my inner
corner and a brow bone with this matte
white eyeshadow you could use a shimmery
one or well but just because there was
shimmer on lid I wanted to keep it matte
and then my favorite part I'm just
cleaning up all the mess underneath my
eye and then really creating that winged
out shape which is going to give us a
really nice guideline for when we go to
do our liquid eyeliner eyeliner today
I'm taking this sleek Dippet eyeliner
this is the first time I'd use it
actually a really a loved it it's got a
really really firm brush so it's quite
hard to kind of you know sometimes on a
brush is really flimsy and then you just
couldn't be really messy with it like I
said this one has quite a firm nib so
you've got a really defined line and
product placement and then the good
thing about doing your eyes first is
that if when you come to do your line or
anything like that you can clean up
again with a wipe and just get it
exactly how you want it without running
any skin makeup then I'm applying a
mascara and lashes these are the Ardell
double up in 207 as you can see they're
kind of more 3d and I just thought that
really added it to it the glam effect
for brows I'm taking this lore'l brow
artist set it comes with a powder and a
gel and I'm just skipping through this
like really quickly but you can kind of
see the motion that I'm doing i used the
powder at the end of my brow because I
need more pigmentation there and the
powder kind of had a bit more of a
darker color to it and because I don't
have any hairs there that's kind of what
I need and then I took the lighter gel
through the front to create that
gradient effect then I like to go ahead
and use a slightly lighter brow kind of
gel set them in place and then just
priming my skin with the NYX primer
spray for foundation I'm mixing these
two shades of True Match accont London
off the top of my head but I have listed
them down below because one
was slightly too light and the other one
was definitely slightly too dark so just
mixing them together to get the kind of
perfect color to match my can and I'm
just buffing that in with one of my
favorite foundation brushes at the
moment and also a sponge the brush I'm
using was from neve cosmetics and then
this is just a damp Beauty Blender and
I'm just using that to kind of press the
excess in and make me remember
give me that flawless finish for
concealer I'm just using the same soap &amp;amp;
Glory concealer that we use as a primer
and with ones that are slightly more
thicker and a bit more creamier
consistency I like to do very thin
layers and apply it with a brush and
then blend out with a Beauty Blender to
avoid any creasing and just so we're not
applying too much product on our face
you guys know I love translucent powders
specifically more loose ones but I never
can find one from a drugstore so here's
a good tip just by a regular pressed
translucent powder and just kind of Ram
like either like a fork or just
something that's got like a bit of an
edge to it and kind of create your own
translucent loose setting powder I got
there in the end and it works just as
well but I'm taking this powder from NYX
it is I can't remember the name of it
exactly I've left it down below in the
description for sure I'm just using that
around the edges of my face as that one
is more to my skin colour and obviously
the other one was more translucent to
help brighten up underneath in my eyes
this is the other half of that palette
that we used on our eyes and it I'm
using it the bronzer shade from it just
in a brush and adjusting it around the
perimeters of my face and down the edges
of my nose to kind of contour them
slightly and then I'm going to go in
with one of my favorite products this is
the Maybelline strobing stick in medium
nude glow I think is and you guys like
to know when it comes to cream
highlighters I like to use my finger
first just because I feel like that
warms up the product and it helps me
blend it out much better and then going
in with the highlighted up from the
palette on a Mac 2 to 4 brush this is
obviously one that I specifically use
for highlighting so I'm not going to
have I should on my face I'm just going
over where we placed the cream and as
you can see it really intensifies the
highlight then for the eyes I just ran
one of the medium brown shades that we
used earlier
and then I'm going back in with that
berry Emmett dazzle dust on the
in a most part and then blending that
into the shadow just do it kind of
mimics what is going on on the top on
the bottom and then I applied mascara
and these are the finished eyes onto the
lips I am it taking this notorious nude
I think it is sleek pencil and it's
slightly plumping and I've been loving
using this as a base before I go in with
something slightly lighter and for that
I'm taking the NYX soft matte lip cream
in a cairo which is one of my absolute
favorite nudes ever and that is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
