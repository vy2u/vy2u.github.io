yes girls get it hey guys welcome back
to my channel so I'm doing another
Valentine's Day inspired makeup look for
you today
this time it is all drugstore but it is
drugstore glam so still kind of a bit
more like the heavier coverage side and
more of a slightly more intense size
it's definitely a lot softer on the eyes
it was more of a rosy lip which I feel
like a lot of you will appreciate and
it's more than that finish as well
except the skin is super dewy I'm
obsessive the way the skin it came out
if you would have seen in the intro and
stuff and I'll see you'll see throughout
the video I have left everything down
below product wise and I really hope you
guys enjoy it make sure to give it a
thumbs up if you did and subscribe for
more lips if you want to watch the rest
official it's them at please keep
watching okay so I'm going to start with
the skin at first just because for the
eye look that we're doing isn't going to
be too dramatic or anything and I feel
quite comfortable being able to complete
my skin and then move on to the eyes so
I'm just going to do a bit of skin care
first I'm going to use this Ghanian
moisturizer is the moisture bomb I love
the moisture balm a face mask so I'm
literally obsessed with this moisturizer
it's quite intense so it's better if you
have kind of maybe normal to dry skin
but for this look I kind of want it to
be doing really pretty really glowy so I
quite like a hydrating moisturizer the
full hand then I'm going to go ahead and
pry my skin underneath the Nivea PI
shade sensitive balm type thing as a
primer I feel like this is such a good
primer even though this it's not
advertised as one it will see like a
drugstore price now he's going to place
that all around my skin and also like
this is a really at wet feeling primer
as well it does dry to more the khaki
finish but it feels so nice on the skin
I just bought the end using D Real
Techniques multitasker face brush one of
my favorite ones is also from the
drugstore I'm just going to live my
haircut only see okay so before
foundation I'm just going to take a
little bit of the green concealer from
my Maybelline master can i concealer
palette and just applies
on a couple of the blemishes that I have
just here just to kind of cancel out the
redness just making sure it's all
pressed and now some foundation today
I'm actually trying a new one this is
the Maybelline dewy and it's smooth so
it's basically the opposite one of the
matte and poreless and I got this while
I was out in America I'm not sure if
it's in the UK yet if I can find a link
to it obviously I definitely will I'm
going to place a little bit on the back
of my hand I'm just going to stipple it
onto the face just dabbing over the
green concealer cause you don't wanna
move it or anything and this one that
matches my fake turn really nicely so I
like the color I know a lot of people
think like oh my god you're such paler
skin
why did you don't you wear a foundation
it's like that color the rest of my body
is quite handsome if I was just to wear
a foundation not much too kind of my
like I'm tanned skin that's on my face
then I'd look a bit CEO Lee and I do
like to kind of color balance it anyway
when I work if I'd like to concealer
under my eyes so that's not stress
people I am kind of using am was
typically for a brush you would use for
blush additional as blank canvas
cosmetics I just really like the feel of
these brushes and a lot of makeup
artists really like using the Mac one
Mac blusher brush for foundation and
when I used to work that again
loads of people really like to use that
one so just kind of using in it okay
many want to consider I'm going to take
the Maybelline age rewind under
literally nearly at the bottom I'm
obsessed with this one I feel like it
has such a good coverage and I really
love the applicator super soft I can
pick this up the side of my nose and
concrete upside down triangle
couple of dabs around here and then just
going to take a slightly angled kabuki
brush this is again some blank canvas
cosmetics and just press that and buff
that into my ski
in I like to take I like that excess on
that's on the brush I'll float Buster in
just on to my I didn't either I use that
to kind of help pry my eyes I'm loving
how doing my skin is right now I'd say
that concealer comes more like a satin
finish as well so close in the kind of
dewy look that we're going for and then
before we upheld I am actually going to
go in with the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
liquid illuminator and just going to
dispense a little bit on my hand this is
more of a kind of a good dark gold me
kind of color I'm going to take a dual
claudication and I'm going to take a duo
fiber brush like this and almost kind of
buff it into my skin as because it could
bronze up obviously it's more of a
curious finish so if she's going to give
a nice glow underneath the bronze that
we do apply then just going to be a duo
fiber brush to kind of press it in then
I am just going to use my fingers to
kind of like a blender out
love to look up that kind of like
healthy aglow uni it's really subtle and
really like pretty and fresh then I'm
going to go ahead and mix indeed two
colors together and I'm going to use
that to set I believe my eyes miss is
the next part of contour kit I'm just
going to avoid kind of where I just
paste that dewy highlighter so just kind
of concentrating this meanie
I like the inner part and then I just
like to set my eyelids and set my
holders in place but set any like creams
on my eyelids and pestle and the
obviously go with the eye makeup but
what I like about these powders is that
they are to cut full coverage they just
kind of like set everything in place and
give a really nice finish to the skin as
well I wouldn't say they actually have
like a necessarily like notably matte
finish so we're still going to get that
doing is like coming through
and I'm also kind of dusting the product
not kind of really like packing it on oh
my god I'm so obsessed with this skin
right now so my cute contour I'm going
to take the lightest shade on the
palette here and this palette is like
really really pigmented with the contour
shades I find especially so I just make
it ripe apple of the excess of because
it's obviously easier to add more than
it is to take away and we don't want to
look like muddy so just taking a little
angled brush like this this one is from
backstage Beauty
I just like to use like backward
circular motion gives such a nice itself
and contour I'm obsessed with this
product I think a lot of people make the
mistake of kind of using their contour
as a bronzer and I feel like that's
something you can start to look a bit
muddy and because the colors not right a
bronzer is meant for bronzing I'm and I
think of bronzing I think of like warm
tones mr. Blair's contouring is designed
to mimic like more depth to your face
and create the illusion of shadows and
shadows obviously like more of a cool
tone in comparison so that's why you
just don't go too heavy with anything
that you're using to contour and you can
save that for bronzing speaking of which
for bronze I'm actually going to take
the Noah filter powder from next this is
their like face powder works amazingly
on the face by the way like I said kind
of more because Duke of the Mac
mineralize skinfinish it but I'm just
taking this one in the color 11 it
golden so it works really nicely as a
really nice warm tan bronzer I'm going
to take a big fluffy brush so I don't
dispense too much it's just kind of used
to dust all over my face okay now on to
brush I'm taking the L'Oreal blush
sculpt in a soft rosy which looks like
oh like this is just kind of a range of
really nice soft pinky blush colors and
the line the middle is actually more of
a peachy undertone which I reap refer
I'm just going to take a mix of like all
three kind of mainly concentrating on
the lighter and the middle part but I'm
just going to adjust this answer matrix
oh my god
oh I'm obsessed with the skin already
okay before doing highlighter I always
like to do my brows first just because I
find like when I do at my eyebrows I
have to extend mine quite a bit and
extending it and like obviously trying
to draw it on onto something pretty
shiny cuz like that then I've got like
shiny eyebrows so before I apply my
highlighter I'm just going to use this
pencil from NYX is that a micro brow
pencil again not hundred percent sure if
they come out with these yet but these
are such a good dupe to the brows from
Anastasia Beverly Hills so I'm just
going to go ahead and fill in this brow
to show you look at the difference right
here okay so like I said I'm going to
take the microbial pencil from NYX
is in the color ash brown on a few I
can't remember if these have come out
yet but if they haven't these are going
to be like the best brow hooks in the
drugstore I swear I love them seen a
certain group out she pants on the
Loreal brow artist plumper and more gun
burn stuff but pencil wise the color
range of these are so good so I am a
disco star and they have a spoolie as
well and it's a good one I'm just going
to brush through just so all the hairs
are kind of going in the same direction
then I like to start about here and just
use lots of little strokes kind of fill
in the sparse areas on the top and like
in the middle section then I like to
create the tail of the brow then I come
across it just like to use them as
horizontally through them head on and as
I get the front go vertically and if
you've been a little too harsh in the
front just like brush the product up and
and then I am just going to scoop them
out slightly using it to same Maybelline
it concealer palette and take that
middle shade hair like to kind of
concentrate most of the products in the
center where I want most a highlight
could be and just drag it down across
and go take a fluffier kind of cream
brush and just buff it down nuts brows
done now moving on to the eyes and 100
sure what I want to do yet I'm going to
go ahead and do it this I of comer and
then I'll be back and do this one okay
so this is what I came up with and I'm
literally obsessed so let me show you
how to do it also I just remembered guys
I forgot to highlight afterward but look
at it I use the same product in my inner
corner so just highlight them so don't
worry I haven't forgotten so for the
crease I am going to take the next
ultimate eye shadow palette and this is
the bright one and I'm actually going to
make this orange and yellow together as
our initial transition color is making
sure the lid
set in tonie's with powder and
everything I'm just going to go ahead
and bust this into the crease I'm kind
of going for like a rounded blown out
look which is definitely a go-to
eyeshadow I like style for me when I'm
like in a rush not I'm in a rush right
now but like when I'm in a rush but when
I still look put together I think it
looks really like effortless and it's
really literally it nothing at all so
just like that people click and then I'm
going to take the next ultimate eye of a
palette and this is the warm neutrals
one and I'm going to take this warm
brown kind of here to further deepen up
the crease so I'm just going to kind of
pack that on to start with and then ease
access to kind of bust into my socket
concentrating it mainly on the outer
part of my eye I just like to take it
across the lid so we can like visibly it
see the color transition okay for the
lid shade I'm just going to prime my
eyes slightly using at the annexed
glitter glue just cuz we're going to be
using a pigment and I feel like pigments
apply better when you've got something
khaki underneath just so they don't
cancer art I'm not going to likely to
see some other my iron being just a
little bit on a synthetic brush this is
the Sigma concealer f70 brush I'm just
gonna grab that all over my lid kind of
where I want the pigment to go taking
out a little bit obviously into the
crease color that we've placed across
the lid so it all blends a lot easier if
you've ever found trouble with pigments
lasting on your eye or you find it they
transfer put something tacky down for a
good degree works really well and it the
pigment I'm using is from Barry M is
this gorgeous rose gold color I think
this is the color at 39 is a gorgeous
rose gold I will leave it linked down
below and just taking a flat brush I'm
just going to pack it on it where we
just placed the glue
such a gorgeous rose gold color I kind
of want to add a better place glitter
and sparkle into the mix so I'm just
going to take the leftover kind of glue
that I had on my hand on that same
synthetic brush and press on top again
because because I don't want too much of
the promo that spot on top sky take away
from the color you just want to learn a
bit about cracking there and then I'm
going in it would be a berry and this is
like dad collector and it's number 15 I
think it's kind of like iridescent gold
and literally just taking the smallest
amount on a flat brush you can see that
barely any at all just lightly pressing
this on top just to kind of add a really
nice Sparkle and like a gold reflex to
it it's kind of tie in with my oldest
Jewish skin and like all that stuff just
like that and then I am just going to
affirm it juicing up to soak it with one
more color and in that color again is
from Italy in Nick's warm neutral
palette and is this shade right here
it's really like you're taking that on a
slightly smaller definer brush just
concentrating it on the outer corner and
then just going back in with the
original fluffy brush just to diffuse
everything together so if you can see it
just created a really nice soft diffuse
look I love love love this kind of
eyeshadow to highlight my inner corner
I'm going to take the sleekly attaches
kiss highlighting palette and just take
this shade all the shade here I'm just
going to hide it like in a corner and
then my brow bone as well
I want quite an intense shim under there
because I never do that really and I
want to kind of tie in good skin and
then I'm just going to mix the two
powder shades together on a highlighter
brush and obviously you start to
highlight my skin because I forgot
honestly I'm obsessed with this
highlighting palette it's like the best
drugstore or actually just wanted the
best highlighters oh then I'm actually
going to dip back into the vivid
right palette and mix these two pink
shades together because I kind of want
like a little pop of pink on the lower
lash line and but be something different
and more kind of appropriate to the
Valentine's Day theme she's going to go
pencil brush and buff that along my
lower lash line I think if you want to
experiment with color having a like bold
lower lash line is quite a nice way to
go into it one that like complements
your eye shade so maybe if you've got
green eyes try like I'd like pinky
purple color if you've got brown eyes
again kind of more like a ready purpley
kind of color or maybe even like a green
like that and then I'm going to go ahead
and apply it mascara I'm using the
Maybelline falsies push-up mascara
especially love to some scar on one
bottom lashes the brush makes it so
easier to like grab all the little ones
now you could just leave it there but
you guys know I love false lashes and
once I've applied aren't really like to
dramatically anything I think they're
brilliant like some of them like my
favorite ones from the drugstore he is a
a beard learned that from allure and I
think that part of their like luck
friend
you guys are following me on snapchat I
did while I was in LA take a picture of
these and say like do we have these in
the UK to stay on so gorgeous earlier
and our Dell is definitely my favorite
brands from the drug so when it comes to
false eyelashes and these ones are
almost like faux mink one so I will
leave the link down below if I can find
them so these are what the finished eyes
look like I'm obsessed I think a little
pop of pink is really acute this
Valentine's Day especially if you want
to do something different so if it looks
I'm going to be mixing it to liquid
lipsticks together these others click
map knees and they are in the color
industry and shabby chic I'm going to
apply bittersweet first and then kind of
shabby chic more in the middle I feel
quite confident to use these without a
liner just because they're so pigmented
and I can even really careful I can just
kind of use them to over line my lips if
I need to I love the formula these are
really quick to drive and really smooth
as well and then like I said I'm going
to go in with that Chevy sheet color
just to kind of manipulate the color
slightly but I'm going to concentrate
this mainly in the middle
that was dia finished look I really hope
you guys like it obviously it feel free
to interchange colors and products and
stuff this is just kind of like an idea
of a drugstore makeup glam lips that you
can do a Valentine's Day obviously I
need FDA but I just thought it was
appropriate if you like this makeup lip
