today is a slightly different type of
video for me is in collaboration with
Kiko Milani cosmetics I'm showing you
guys obviously I've heard of that brand
and basically to mark the launch of
their new at Beauty games collection I
have teamed up with them to do a couple
videos if you showcase the range and
also they have a beauty games website
launched a which shows five Beauty
disciplines that kind of make up their
beauty games which are precision
elegance versatility speed and
creativity so today I am it doing the
best each one so I'm doing like a day
and nighttime look this is obviously the
nighttime look the I thought this would
be super cool just to kind of show you
maybe from going like school or work
makeup and then just showing you how
easy it is and still using the products
that you might used earlier in the day
to kind of up your look and take it from
a day to night time make sure to click
the link down below for the Kiko Beauty
games website and when you play you can
get 20% off the beauty games range which
is amazing yeah if you like the look of
these makeup looks then make sure to
subscribe if you haven't already make
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
let's get started
starting off with the clean face I'm
going in with the keycode City filter
primer this one is amazing it's got a
really high SPF underneath so especially
we're going to be out all day or in the
Sun that your skin is going to stay
protected and prepped and then because I
have a slightly more tan to neck thin
face I'm using this underneath
foundation this is so cool it's their
fresh cushion based Perfector in medium
to dark as you can see it went on clear
but then it gradually kind of builds up
a color so perfect if you're like me and
you turn your neck and you just need a
bit of like an under color underneath
your base I'm going to go ahead and
apply foundation and eyebrows off-camera
but kind of add a tiny bit more coverage
I'm going in with the Kiko skin
evolution concealer in the color zero
two just in any expertise that I want
coverage or just to get rid of any dark
under-eye circles and I'm just buffing
it in using this Kiko face 1:08 brush
this concealer is kind of medium to full
coverage so perfect for kind of getting
rid of any imperfections now I'm going
in with the 3d light and glow in the
color 0-1 as a cream highlighter just
before applying any powder products so
it blends much easier into the skin and
gives a really a gorgeous glow
as you can see I'm obsessed with this
and now like I said just going in with
powder this is their matte fusion powder
in the color zero four just kind of
applying this to where we applied the
concealer just to mattify not to add too
much coverage and just set the face now
for this a bronzer this is their Kiko
outdoor bronzer in a technical honey as
you saw the size it's absolutely massive
and it's so obviously affordable as you
guys know the brand so you're getting so
much for so like the little m price and
the color is really warm as well now on
to the eyes I'm just going in with the
Kiko eye base just blending that all
over then I'm taking the take it all
Beauty kit and this is amazing if you
travel a lot it's got eyes shadows this
face products as an eyeliner it also
comes with the brushes as well and I'm
just taking the bronzer from the kit and
using that as the initial transition
shade then I'm taking a flat brush and
the white shade and just packing this
all onto the lid this is a fairly
neutral palette all of their kind of
things I'm using do come in other
different colors as well because they're
all about living colorfully and offering
a huge amount of color to everyone and
then as you saw I just dipped this
fluffy brush into a mix of the bronzer
and the slightly darker color for a bit
more depth and then on a pencil brush
taking the same bronzer from the kit and
just running that underneath my eye then
I'm going in with a beauty energy
mascara this has such firm bristles if
you're like me it helps kind of shorter
lashes you can really wiggle and get
that length and definition and then I'm
just applying it along the bottom as
well then using their everlasting Kajal
liner in the color zero one place on
that in my waterline to open and
brighten up my eye on to the lips I am
at taking this precision lip pencil in
the color 501 I believe and just lining
my lips and then going in with their
finish line lipstick in the colour 0-1
as well for a nude everyday look so this
is the daytime look as you can see it's
super minimal super easy perfect for
like work or school or something where
you're not allowed to a huge amount of
makeup but you know kinda want to look
presentable and now I'm going to show
you a few steps using some more even of
the same kind of bug that eyeshadow
palette and then some extra little
products that you can use and extra
steps to take to take from a daytime to
a nighttime look I'm taking the 3d color
and glow blush it in the color 0-2
just to kind of add a
more color and a bit more depth to my
cheeks these colors blend out so easy
they're super creamy and they work
really nicely and then going in with the
same bronzer as we did before I'm just
using it just to intensify the color and
make our face look a bit more put
together for the nighttime and then back
onto the eyes I'm going back in with the
same palette and fluffy brush and just
mixing the two darkest shades together
to kind of create more of a smoky
dramatic eye look and on a small angled
brush taking the darkest color and just
using it almost as a smokey liner effect
as you can see then again I'm doing the
same but just on the lower lash line
then I am taking the everlasting Kajal
liner in at0 to that you could use a
black on from the palette but Brown it
looks a lot softer on my eyes and then
going in with these lashes in the style
0-1 I'm obsessed they've got the perfect
amount of drama and wing and then I
wanted to go for a bit of a brighter lip
and I thought why not go for red so I'm
using the comfort lip liner in the shade
zero weight 3:05 to line my lips and
then the finish line lipstick in 0/3 for
that gorgeous red lip and this is the
finished nighttime look as you saw I use
pretty much some of majority of the same
products in either different colors or
just intensifying the shade and then of
course I added a bright lip or something
a bit different yeah this was my take on
the versatility game so like I said
