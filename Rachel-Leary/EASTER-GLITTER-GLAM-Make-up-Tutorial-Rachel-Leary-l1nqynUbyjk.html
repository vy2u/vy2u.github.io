am back to my usual schedule this week
with uploads on it Tuesday and Thursday
kind of makeup tutorial base why just
cuz I've missed doing them at so so so
much I feel like I haven't been doing
makeup because of it so I wanted to get
back into the swing of things so today I
did this kind of glittery spring Easter
appropriate color scheme means smoky eye
type thing I use a bunch of new products
as well that you guys have been asking
me to use so I really hope you guys
enjoyed and get to see my opinions on
them those of you said that you wanted
to see something with purple so I
thought I would kind of complement it
with some green irreflexive glitter and
some kind of joke Rome in a corner and
just buy highlighter going on I use the
new Anastasia videos Aurora highlighter
you may note that is I have messed
everything in the description bar down
below that I have used Mel C yourseives
drops tutorial so if you like the look
of this makeup lip and make sure to give
it a thumbs up subscribe if you haven't
already and I'm going to start off with
priming my eyes is when my favorite eye
primers this is from Maybelline is that
color tattoo in the color creme de nude
and it is one of Roger I said one of my
favorite ones it literally gets rid of
any discoloration on the lid and makes
anything I put on top kind of really
stands out but I always make sure to set
it with powder so this is what I'm just
doing there or like a similar color
eyeshadow works just as well then I'm
going to fill in my eyebrows and to do
so I'm using two shades of the benefit
precisely brow pencil it's in the shade
for the ends of my brows which is what
I'm using just there and then I use the
shade three towards the front of my brow
to kind of read it further up and create
a gradient effect then I'm going in with
the Too Faced is it naturally loved or
natural love palette and I'm taking this
soft brown shade am i using that as our
initial transition color I think it's
called a honey butter which i think is a
really cute name but just lending that
into the crease and then I am at taking
it this shade from a color pop I've
listed it down below I think it's called
silver lining and I'm just using that to
further deepen up the crease and I'm
making sure to take it pretty much
halfway of course because I want the
color to kind of be really pigmented
going across the lid to create the
gradient effect if that makes sense so
I'm making sure to take it quite far
across the open lid and then taking this
color here from colour-pop also is one
of their single shadows it is one of my
favorite pink eyeshadows to use ever
even though
kind of stance my brushes but I'm just
using that to buff into the creases well
I've left the name of it down below and
then I'm going back in with the honey
butter shade because that kind of works
as are like a razor shade when we're
blending everything together for the lid
I'm going back into that Too Faced
palette and then using the shade kitten
I think there's a really gorgeous golden
lilac shade I think and I'm using a
really small brush just to pack that on
across the lid and then going back in
with the purple eye shadow as you can
see this is kind of what I was trying to
describe earlier just to create that
transition so I'm actually kind of going
back in with all the colors just to
reinforce them and make sure that they
really stand out and we can really see
them clearly then I'm going to go in
with this product this is one of the gun
or is it with the heavy metal glitter
liners from urban decay and the color
distortion and it's basically clear but
it has a reflex of green I thought it's
going to be really complementary with
all the pinks and purples that were
using and again with the green theme I
am taking this shade here from the
anastasia beverly hills aurora
highlighting palette and I'm using that
to highlight my inner corner to really
kind of it blend and tie it all together
then I'm taking a makeup wipe you guys
know the drill and just cleaning up the
fallen eyeshadow to create a winged out
effect and really tidy everything up but
we aren't actually going to be doing any
winged liner and going straight in with
mascara and then applying these lashes
these are from a pinky go and I'll
obsessed that in the style
Arwa I think and that they're just
literally a gorge and then I'm going to
put this shade from Marc Jacobs in my
waterline again
notice the link to it down below and the
shade name for skincare I'm going in
with it VZ this hero a glow drops oil
I've been loving this at the moment it
barely leaves a greasy effect so you can
put your makeup on straight away and
it's a primer I'm using this one from a
collection it is that illuminating
primer I've been trying this out and
I've been really liking and I kind of
wanted that illuminated skin look so a
lots of skin products I'm using all kind
of illuminating it's a vegetable that
would rely in with the kind of fresh
spring the Easter Eve I was going for so
for foundation I'm using the NARS all
day luminous foundation definitely
making sure to give it a shake before I
use and then just apply a couple pumps
of that and then up buffing that into my
skin this is in the shade Stromboli
I think and it matches my pan really
well this is definitely more like a
yellow base foundation I do know that
they do it tons of
shades of this so if you're in the
market quite like a medium coverage
luminous foundation and you don't mind
spending a little bit of money then I
would definitely check this out not
using up the ages and I never
disappointed my user the concealer I'm
taking a new product this is the benefit
of rays paste it definitely has more of
a pinky undertone but I find it doesn't
really stay pink on the skin which I
like I definitely prefer a more yellow
based face when it comes to any products
that I use but the pink undertones and
it really helped to brighten and get rid
of any dark circles if you struggle with
any dark under-eye circles I definitely
recommend this one because of the pink
undertone and also because the coverage
of it is amazing it's quite a full
coverage as well and apparently this is
what Mario uses on compulsion so you
want that look get this concealer I'm
then going to use this product from that
benefit as well is one of the best cream
foundations in the shade deep and
apparently it makes all of you it does
after I view that I can say that it does
makes a really gorgeous cream like
bronzer just like this should now filet
de tan type thing but I think this will
might be slightly obviously it more
affordable not sure if I still do any
more I hope that they do but yeah
definitely check it out cuz I absolutely
loves the finish of this and then I'm
going to lightly dust some Laura Mercier
powder to set everything in place just
because like I said I work kind of
wanted like a glowy luminous lightweight
finish so I didn't want to be setting
everything and getting rid of the glow
like giving myself completely matte look
I did want some tips like showing
through but then I'm taking this bronzer
from them in the shade CET smells
amazing by the way and has a really
gorgeous golden shimmer running through
it so tied in perfectly with the skin
look I was going for I'm just using this
to kind of go over where we place the
cream bronzer and give us all rounded
room below and for blusher I'm taking
this one from novice in the shade torrid
which is a really gorgeous pink shade to
tie it in with like the eyes and stuff
and then going back to the Aurora's
locate I'm mixing these two shades
together and taking the slightly darker
more golden one as I called base glow
and then I'm going in with a Mac two to
four brush and using the lighter one on
top just to kind of make the highlight
really stand out and really pop and both
of these have a warmer undertone with
like a duo chrome of pink running
through it so again I thought that would
really it tie it in with the eye makeup
look and something a little bit
different you know what I mean
yes now going back to the eyes I'm
taking this pink eyeshadow here from the
same palette it's actually got a shimmer
running through it which I thought was
really pretty and different and I'm just
running that along my lower lash line
and blending it up into that eyeliner
that we just use and then I am taking
that other color pop eyeshadow that we
use and just applying it on the outer
part of our lower lash line just to kind
of connect everything together like back
up into the wing of the eyeshadow then
I'm just going to apply the mascara
again and these are be finished eyes the
lips I am taking it the shade petal from
sleek matte me liquid lipsticks and it's
a really gorgeous like puffy pink but it
does have more like a violet undertone
running through it which I thought
really tied in with the eyes as well
kind of similar to the lower lash line I
to know that we just use and then using
it that I should've using that shade
from the Anastasia Beverly Hills cloak
it's just on my Cupid's bow and in the
center and then using this dazzle glass
from Mac this is in it Venus just to top
it all off and add a bit of like sparkle
and get to the look so that was the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial make sure you
have bone up if you do and definitely
and make sure to leave it future video
suggestions in the comments down below I
love knowing what you guys want to see
and literally like I said earlier said
that you want to see the mink on it
perfectly and liner key so I thought I
would do that and I can add a little bit
of a twist and use it some brand new
products as well so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and I will
see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
