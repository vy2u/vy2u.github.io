today I'm going to be teaching you with
my personal tips and the steps that I
take to ensure my line looks like this
and to avoid this I know you've all been
there so if you find this video helpful
make sure to give it a thumbs up for
more beauty hacks and subscribe if you
haven't already and let's go ahead and
get started
there are many ways to ensure your
eyeliner slays every time but my number
one trick is definitely your eye makeup
first this makes it much easier to clean
up and so you don't ruin your face
makeup and also if you like me and have
short brows doing your brows first also
really helps as it gives you an angle
idea of whether line should be and
finally shake your hand struggle is real
so make sure you have something to lean
on firstly your eyeliner isn't going to
bang unless you're using the right tools
and products whether it's pen liquid or
gel you want to make sure you're using
something that you're comfortable with
my favorite pen liners are than L'Oreal
super slick and the Kat Von D tattoo
liner this is because they're super
pigmented and the nibs are really
defined and precise so I can be really
specific with my placement and allows me
to create amazing sharper lines also
really amazing liquid liners are of
course my favorite NYC liquid liner and
the Sigma line ace both have very thin
flat brushes and a super pigmented so
again allow me to be really precise with
my product placement for today's
tutorial I'm going to be using a gel
liner this is the Inglot number 77 it
makes a couple of the inglot duraline
into it and it makes it super creamy and
easy to apply and also water-resistant
so really handy if you have naturally
watery eyes tools are also super
important some of my favorite brushes to
use other Sigma zero six which I also
use my brows really small really precise
angle so you can get super sharp lines
but my favorite are the e 11 and the Mac
210 as they're so thin and precise and
allow me to either create a really thin
line or build up a thickness personally
I like to do my lid liner first and then
a wing since depending on how thick I
want my lid to be I would determine the
size of the wing everyone has naturally
oily oily lids as well so if you aren't
planning on using much eye shadow
setting your lid with a translucent
powder will make application much easier
and smoother to apply
starting from the inner corner making
sure my eyes are open and looking down I
personally don't do it with my eyes
closed I use short small strokes and
take it about a third of the way in a
little tip if you have quite loose skin
on your eyes pinching your nose tightens
that part making the application much
easier and it's smoother to apply once
you've done that you can create a guide
for yourself across your lid by creating
little marks to make sure the thickness
across your lid is accurate almost like
a doctor door
once you've done that connect the marks
and fill it in again using multiple
short strokes as you don't want to get
cocky and it up now I always fill
in about 3/4 of the way leaving a little
gap at the end
now for the part most find the hardest
the wing using tape as a hacker loads of
people love as allows you to be really
messy yet still get a sharp line be
precise every time but if you've watched
my tutorials in the past you know a
method I like to do is to be super mess
with my eye shadow and then wipe it away
with a wipe at the angle that I want
which is why do my brows verse really
helps as it gives me a guide and the
sharp line I create gives me a base for
my wing I always do the base of the wing
first starting from the outer corner of
my eye using very light short strokes I
always draw the line much shorter then I
might want it as it's much easier to
build on it than to take it away if you
want that super sharp line a look when
you connect the line back to your lid
leave a couple of millimeters from the
end of the line so the tail will be very
thin and sharp also looking down into a
mirror really helps never close your
eyes as long as the liner looks go with
your eyes open that's all that really
matters you're not gonna be walking
around all day with your eyes shut so
doing your lid liner first also gives
you something to aim towards when you're
connecting the wing which will make it
easier for yourself again at loads of
little strokes with your brush or pen to
avoid mistakes and to get kind of the
most pigmentation from the product
if you didn't use tape like me you can
use a wipe again to really clean and
tighten up the wing and alter the angle
if it doesn't match from the other side
as well
one of my favorite tips if it's not 100%
even instead of faffing about and
panicking trying to change it normally
resulting in it they're coming way
thicker than you wanted and then it's
all ruined using a black eyeshadow in
your outer core in your outer crease and
using that to hide any mistakes blurring
the liner into the shadow and then just
blending it back into your eye makeup
packing it on making sure to keep
checking what it looks like with your
eyes open
this has saved me so many times you can
go back and with a wipe again to clean
up the edge but it just really blurs the
liner and the shadow together so it just
kind of if you've made any mistakes you
can't even tell also can really
intensify a smoky eye and like I said
you can just clean it up with a wipe and
it is good as new once you're happy with
the liner you can use a definer brush
like this Sigma e15 brush and a
concealer this is the mac studio finish
concealer you can really sharpen that
wing this also means when you do your
face makeup on or like your under eye
concealer you don't have to worry about
getting it too close with a brush and
which is normally a really big brush as
you can see and it could potentially
ruin and smudge it so having that
concealer that acts as a guide also if
your eye makeup is minimal you can use
concealer on your lid to tidy up any
mistakes and there you have it my tips
and tricks and hacks to help ensure that
you conquer that dreaded winged liner
