created the lip that I recently post on
my Instagram that a lot of you guys
requested as you can see about the title
I've kind of called it like an easy date
night look just cuz it's all quite
minimal as already soft pink romantic
kind of tones but yeah no lashes
anything like that there is like a
winged liner but see like anything that
I do it's totally optional you can do
your own twist like this is just
something that I would wear and people
change so as always to start I am
prepping my skin with my Mac spray just
to hydrate my skin before foundation I
already have a tutorial on how I do my
eyebrows so I didn't include a tip but
these are the products I'm using and I'm
just putting them in before foundation
just because that's why I prefer to do
full foundation I'm using the Maryland
celeb Pro HD foundation and the Tom Ford
creamy foundation brush and just buffing
it into my skin is a very full coverage
foundation but for like a date night or
something like that I want my
foundations last so I prefer to wear
something full coverage I'm using a
lighter shade of an hour on flood prone
HD foundation this was in the shade like
zero core I think and you ever almost in
the shade like Eurasian and Japanese or
something like that I'm just applying
lucky lucky brush and then a blending
out with a damp Beauty Blender
except that all in place and to contour
I'm using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette and using the banana color shade
to set my concealer and middle brown
shade for contouring and these are the
brushes I'm using to do so
so just applying the powder in the
places that I highlighted and then just
contouring my cheekbones and the tops of
my forehead I mention and add that glow
to my skin I'm using the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in topaz or
the Sigma duo fiber brush I'll leave a
link to all the brushes and products
down below in the description as always
but just lightly dusting this on
basically the places that I contour
before to highlight my cheekbones and
the tip of my nose and Cupid's bow and
all those kind of places I'm using the
Jackson Hill collaboration with Becca
cosmetics the shimmering skin Perfector
in a champagne pop on your Techniques
setting brush
moving on to the eye makeup I am
prepping my Ledger's in the Mac
painterly paint-pot
using a zoeva smudger brush i think it
was called i'll leave a link to it down
below but just apply this all over my
lid as per usual
the eyeshadows I'm using today are from
the zoeva cocoa blend palette and from
makeup geek and to start off with I'm
using this brush from crown that doesn't
have a name on it but using the white
shade from the palette just to highlight
my inner corner and brow burn then I'm
going in with a sigma e40 tapered
blending brush and makeup geek creme
Brule I do have a code with a Sigma in
order for you guys to get 10% off all
your brushes so I will leave a link to
that down below but just buffing this
into the crease is our initial
transition shade then on this zoeva luxe
crease brush I'm using the shade
substitute for love from the same as a
waver palette and just using that to
deepen the crease
then using the same brush I'm using the
shade freshly toasted to do exactly the
same thing just placing it slightly
lower into the crease and just buffing
that in as well then using the makeup
geek foiled shadow in the shade in the
spotlight and this Sigma firm shader
brush I'm using this as my lid shade and
just taking it 3/4 of the way in I'd say
from in a corner aiming towards the
outer corner mixing the two shades by
makeup geek bitten and mocha on this
Sigma small tapered blending brush I'm
just using that to kind of fill in the
outer quarter of the eye as just like a
warm final transition shade then using
that same as a wave a brush from before
using the shade beans are white from the
same zueva palette as well to finally
deepen up the crease and just add a bit
of depth
then just going in with a sigma e30
pencil brush and back with the shade
creme brulee I'm just lightly buffing
this on my lower lash line
do you have a tutorial on how to do
winged eyeliner and I'm just using my
Mac fluidline in the shade black track
just to create a really small flick I
will leave a link to the tutorial down
below but then I am just applying
mascara this is my Mac extended play
mascara I'm not gonna be applying
falsies so I wanted to use a mascara
that was really gonna lengthen and
define my lashes and this is by far the
best one I have ever used
the lips I wanted to keep it quite nude
so I'm using the OCC lip liner in trick
the Tom Ford lipstick in bear and the
gloss in the shade nude as well
and different the finished look I really
hope you guys liked it I'm so sorry I
was late with the upload on this one
I've been doing a lot of work but I am
back to it now please leave in the
comments below video suggestions that
you'd like to see I love reading your
comments and knowing what you guys want
to see next but until next time I will
see you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
