channel so today I thought I would film
a easy minimal makeup look for you guys
because I've noticed recently on my
channel I've been doing a lot of kind of
like full coverage heavy dramtic so I
thought I would bring something a little
more wearable and easier I saw a lot of
requests recently after I did my full
coverage foundation routine but I wasn't
really wearing any or I wasn't wearing
any eye makeup I just on my skin a lot
of requests for a minimal makeup look
just because you guys liked the
appearance of me not wearing really
heavy glam so I thought I would show you
a minimal makeup look that it's still
really put together but just kind of
using a lot less products a lot less
coverage products something's still
really like pretty and wearable for any
time of the day obviously you can switch
out any products that you want the ones
that suit you more these just ones that
tailored to me and which ones I prefer
but I do give a few options so I hope
you find that helpful yeah if you like
the look of this makeup look then please
keep watching
so even when I know that I'm not really
going to be wearing a lot of makeup I
still want my skin to feel really
hydrated especially as I always say
around this time the a my skin gets
really dry so to prep my skin for the
makeup I'm gonna put on top of it I am
using the soap &amp;amp; Glory is a bright and
beautiful six in one radiance serum I
really like this just to give my skin
that kind of glow from within underneath
and it's a really easy product just to
work on really quickly even if you're in
a rush you just want your skin like it
says to feel really energized after you
just wake up so yeah I really like this
put up for that and I'm gonna play that
out
once that's soaked in I'm gonna go ahead
and pry my skin and for this I'm using
the l'oreal lumi magique primer this is
like my go-to primer when I'm applying
makeup basically as soon as I've woken
up or barely been awake for a few hours
or anything just because it's really
glowy on the skin it feels so nourishing
and hydrating and it's a really good
primer anyway like whenever I wear this
anything that I put on top of it I find
lasts really long time and looks really
good so yeah I'm gonna use this and like
I said it has a really nice glow to it
as well for my face as it's kind of easy
minimal makeup I'm not gonna be wearing
a foundation I'm going to be wearing a
CC cream and took the CC cream so I am
in love with is the your skin but better
it cosmetics CC cream and also the Olay
hydration to in one Phoebe cream the BB
cream is a bit more of a lighter
coverage I'd say and because it's
combined with only skincare it's a lot
more hydrating on the skin so it's kind
of more like a tinted moisturizer
whereas this CC cream is a tiny bit more
full coverage I'd say you can really
build up coverage with this and make it
more like a foundation but it's still
going to be really hydrating because
it's a CC cream so the either these two
are my favorite for today I'm gonna be
using this one purely just because I
think the undertone of this one goes a
bit better with my turn
so yeah just applying a couple of pumps
on the back of my hand literally just
two little ones and they're gonna be
buffing into my skin normally I would do
my eyebrows first I always prefer to do
my eyebrows before skin but because this
is really lightweight I don't mind doing
my skin first
now onto eyebrows if you're lucky enough
to have a beautifully naturally shaped
brow and barely need to add anything to
it just to tidy up and just knit in the
shape I really really love the Loreal
brow artist plumper so if you're in like
a rush this is amazing just to really
quickly run through your brows couple of
coats and they look incredible but
unfortunately as you can see I wasn't
blessed with a film I have naturally
quite short eyebrows out - for me to
feel comfortable because I feel like
brows is such a statement part of the
face and I just wish they had a bit more
shape color everything to them and I
really love to use the urban glory brow
art tree pencil and the shade hot
chocolate then whack a bit of this
through just to set it all in place I do
have a tutorial on my eyebrows it's a
bit more in-depth but I feel like it's
really boring to watch people do that
eyebrows because everyone's different
but yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and do
that
off-camera and I'll be right back brow
transformation complete now to continue
on with the skin I like to wear a bit of
concealer under my eyes just because I
feel it adds a bit more shape and
dimension to your face is when your face
is just kind of flat with just one
product on it I just feel like it looks
no odd because I feel like I've each to
their own but you know I just feel like
I need something bit more so I don't
know I explain myself yeah I really like
the Rimmel wake me up concealer under my
eyes this one is in the shade true ivory
so it's just slightly lighter than my
skin tone I'm just gonna be placing a
bit of that under my eyes like so and
then noting that in just with a little
concealer brush you could use your
fingers or anything or a sponge or
whatever whatever you like I'm just
gonna be using a brush
then why my skin is still got all of the
cream products I'm gonna go in with
another cream product which I know you
guys know that I love which is the
bourgeois bronzing primer I find this is
just the quickest way to apply a really
nice bronze look to your skin and like
just really warm up your face without it
looking too heavy cream for me are the
most natural which is why are you like I
always say I like to layer layer creams
in a way that looks really natural one
doing minimal makeup so I'm just taking
a little stippling brush and buffing
that into my cheeks top of my forehead
and any way that I really want to warm
up
so it's me like I said that's kind of
like the quickest way I find to just
kind of give you that really effortless
looking skin in terms of wanting to a
minimal makeup but still looking really
put together creams for me at the way
forward but if you have slightly more of
whether your skin powders are probably
your preferred choice but for me that I
have more dry skin
they're just products that I like to use
then just to set everything in place I'm
going in with my mac studio fix powder
in the shade NC 30 just really lightly
because it's a powder foundation so it
can be quite full coverage if you want
it to but if you use it really sparingly
it's just a really nice set setting
powder and mix everything lasts all day
I find so I'm just going to use that all
over my face to set it all
the final touch to my skin I am just
gonna add a bit of highlighter and this
is the mary lou manizer by the balm just
because i think a little highlighter on
the cheeks goes a long way in terms of
just making your skin look really put
together and healthy and glowy so just
applying a little bit of that on the
tops of my cheekbones in Cupid's bow but
skin done I'm now moving on to eyes like
I said I think the same method with skin
applies to eyes for me as well if I'm
going to be really quick and minimal and
just like something that I know it's
going to look pretty nice but without
wearing too much I really like cream
products on the eyes so a few of my
favorites I thought I'd share are the
makeup revolution rose gold foiled
eyeshadow Charlotte Tilbury cream shadow
pencil in the shade champagne diamonds
so they're all of a cos similar all of
like a similar rose gold II color just
because I think that's really nice for
everyday it's nothing too dramatic or
anything like that and also the NYX
jumbo pencil in the shade yoga I really
like that one as well and today I'm just
going to use the makeup revolution
foiled eyeshadow just all over my lid
and that's gonna be it for I shadow
actually I might I'm gonna go in a tiny
bit with the mary-lou manizer by the
balm so I'm not using any other products
I'm just using one that we've already
used I'm just gonna apply that in my
inner corner just to bring that up
slightly then this is an optional step
but for me it makes such a difference
I'm gonna go ahead and curl my lashes
these are the Mac half lashes and I'm
half lashes these are the Mac half
eyelash curlers and these are like my
favorite colors of all time I don't know
what it is about them being so small I
feel like you just get much more of a
precise curl when using them so yeah I'm
gonna go ahead and do that and then
apply mascara like so and my chosen
mascara is the it cosmetics
hello lashes mascara just because I
absolutely love the formula this one
it's not too clumpy and the brush is
really firm as well so for me I've got
little lashes so this really coats every
lash and really helps to comb them as
well and the little it's almost got like
a 360 brush and a little brush thing at
the end really is useful on like your
bottom lashes and those little annoying
inner corner one so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply mascara so that's all I'm
gonna do for the eyes which I know is
super minimal but that is the whole
point of this video something a bit
easier and wearable for you guys so now
moving on to the lips I'm gonna be
wearing a lipstick and a lip gloss you
can wear either or both the same as me
I've recently just picked up the Gerard
cosmetics lipstick in the shade
buttercup so I really want to try this
and use this it's a really pretty pinky
like rosy shade so I'm gonna apply this
and then on the top where the Tanya burr
lip gloss in the shade daydream just to
lighten up the color slightly and I
prefer a gracia lip on like a mineral
makeup day just because I feel it ties
in with having like animal on the eyes
and it just adds a little broth and full
of sparkle you know I mean so it brings
something to the table so that is the
color of the lipstick on its own inform
you
just a tiny bit too pink so I like I
said I'm just gonna be lying it
lightining it slightly so this is the
finished makeup look for my easy minimal
makeup
I hope you guys enjoyed it and liked it
like I said the beginning of the video
I've done a lot of really full-coverage
heavy duty makeup and I know that's not
for everyone
especially this time of year when you're
still working or at school or just I
feel like this time of year everyone
gets really lazy because it's cold and
stuff so I just wanted to show you a
minimal makeup look that's really easy
to do kind of requires minimal products
and you can switch out or add to or do
anything you want with this look but
it's still I feel really put together
and you could wear this out or doing
nothing just whatever I feel these
tutorials aren't obviously as fun as
like doing like a broody winged out
smokey eye and stuff but then
realistically you don't wear that all
the time so trying to keep things
diverse on this channel and I see the
comments on people that want to see
something more minimal so I hope this
answered your comment scoot this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and leave
future video recommendations in the
comments below and make sure to follow
