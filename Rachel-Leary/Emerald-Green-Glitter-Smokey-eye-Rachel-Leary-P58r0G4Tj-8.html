to start off by hydrating my skin I am
using my mac fix+ spray then for a
primer I am using this little sample
that I have of the benefit professional
and just buffing that into my skin using
this Real Techniques and multitask brush
then to add a bit of glow to my skin I
am using the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector liquid in the shade opal and
just using the same brush and buffing
that into my skin to add a bit of color
and like I said a bit of glow underneath
my foundation
I'd literally just have my eyebrows
threaded today so I'm super excited to
fill them in and I used my dip brown
medium brown and my L'Oreal brow artist
plumper to prime at my eyes I'm using
the color tattoo from Maybelline in the
shade of creme de Rose and then going in
with the initial transition shade as
Pacifica green tones lips I'm using a
warm up green toned Brown and this is
Mac uninterupted it's one of their Pro
Longwear eyeshadows then I'm using this
matte eyeshadow from makeup geek in time
travel and just buffing that into the
crease and I'm building up the color
with this because it's quite a dark one
compared to the uninterrupted shade so
you don't want to go in too heavy so the
trick is to pick up small amount of
products buff it in and just build up
the intensity that you want
next I'm taking I think this is
enchanted forest from makeup geek sorry
for all the makeup geek eyeshadows I
recently picked up a few and I'm just
testing out the colors and playing with
them if you're from the UK you can now
get them from at Beauty Bay and also you
can purchase them mostly from the makeup
geek websites so hopefully they're
accessible for everyone so like I said
I'm just building up the intensity with
this color again and then going in with
the initial fluffy brush that I use to
apply the uninterrupted shade to make
sure that all the colors are really
seamlessly blended together for the lid
shade I'm taking this foiled eyeshadow
from makeup geek in Houdini it's this
gorgeous blue a toned emerald green and
I'm just pressing that all over my empty
lid space I find these apply best and
you get the most pigmentation from them
and you almost rub them into your lid so
as you can see I'm using like a
backwards and forwards motion to apply
ur super excited about this product this
is one of the makeup geek sparklers in
the shade Martian I wasn't really sure
how to apply it so I first sprayed my
lid with a fix plus and then I also put
picked up some product onto my brush and
sprayed that with FIPS plus as well and
I'm just pressing it onto the lid and
that's the way I found to apply them you
can get the sparklers from et Bay as
well so get them while you can
and then taking it that enchanted forest
shade and buffing that back into my
crease to make sure it's all blended
together and then again going in with
the initial fluffy brush to make sure
everything is seamlessly blended
together then using my wipe to clean out
the fallout definitely recommend doing
your eyes first for this tutorial just
because the shades that I've used are
quite dark and intense so you don't want
it to ruin your face makeup if you did
have if you had done that first then
going ahead and doing my gel liner this
is the Inglot gel liner in number 77 I
do have a tutorial on it and I always do
link it in the description then taking
any matte black eyeshadow this is just
corrupt from makeup geek and just
buffing that into the crease to further
deepen and blend the eyeliner and
everything all up together
then using L'Oreal's of fuller both
lashes sculpt mascara this is literally
one of the best mascara I have used this
combing formula means that I get every
lash and it's amazing on the bottom
lashes as you'll see in a moment it's
one of their newest ones I'm pretty sure
it's the most recent one that has come
out and I definitely saw it in super
drug today so you can get your hands on
it too you can leave it there but I am
gonna use my Espino lashes in his style
viola lash I do have a discount code
below just to add it to the cat eye
smokey eyes drama you know I love my
false lashes and this is the kind of
half completed eye look going on it to
the face makeup I use my Bourjois
healthy mix a foundation the gel form in
the shade 55 and then at buffing that
into my skin for concealer I am using my
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye in the
shade light and I'm applying it with the
concealer brush that comes with it I
think just under my eyes and in all the
usual places that I would apply my
concealer using a damp Beauty Blender
I'm then buffing out I definitely
recommend using a Beauty Blender for
this because it is quite a heavy duty
concealer alright dad my name is dead
hahaha anyways I'm just continuing it to
buff this into my skin and I'm kind of
exchanging the angle of the beach bands
depending on which part of the face that
I use I find it to be the best technique
you don't have to use two powders that I
am going to fake my under eyes with my
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
and then once I have cleared away the
excess of that I'm going in with my Nev
Neve cosmetics translucent powder in the
shade nude just to add a bit of shimmer
and brightening underneath the eye I
just personally like the effect of this
but like I said it is an unnecessary
step so it's up to you this is me I find
the needs cosmetic powder you probably
can't tell the difference but in person
it just really helps to brighten up my
under eyes even more
well what bronzer I don't know if this
is new but I saw it in super drug today
and I had to get it it's the golden
bronzer from Bourjois I know they have
the original chocolate one and this one
does still smell like chocolate but this
one is more of a golden undertone and
has a bit more of a shimmer and I'm just
a pilot to my cheeks and forehead all
the usual places
sticking with more of a bronzey theme
just a tie-in with the green I'm using
this blusher from Lars in the shade
luster which is like a peachy tone with
like golden reflex through it so super
pretty and ties in really nicely with
the eyes for my highlight I'm using a
champagne pop from Becca and Jaclyn hill
I haven't used this in ages and when I
put it on I instantly thought why
haven't I worn this in so long because
it is the most perfect highlighter ever
and I'm just applying that to my
cheekbones nose and Cupid's bow and also
in my inner corner as a little highlight
to make sure that that part of my eye is
still bright as well then going on to my
waterline I'm taking this eye liner from
NARS the names in the description and I
did point to it there cuz it's quite a
weird and complicated name then I am
mixing the uninterrupted and enchanted
forest shades together on a pencil brush
and buffing that on my lower lash line
it's a tie-in with the look this mascara
for bottom lashes like I said earlier is
literally incredible as you can see it
really it grabs every lash I think it's
the wand the Wonder is literally amazing
this is the finished eye look so as you
can see a broody nice emerald green and
smokey eye feeling a bit different than
I would normally do going onto the lips
I'm taking this cream puff from
collection in the shade nude puff in
number two I think and just applying
that one of my lips with no lip liner
but I am gonna be applying a gloss this
is the OCC stained gloss in Mian hair I
think it's pronounced and I'm just
patting that onto my lips because I
don't want the product underneath to
separate or anything and that is the
finished look I really hope you guys
