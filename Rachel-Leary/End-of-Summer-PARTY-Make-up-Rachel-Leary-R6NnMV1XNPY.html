today I was inspired by the warm weather
and I thought oh my gosh it's gonna be
coming to an end soon like it's coming
to the end of August and if you're from
the UK that's kind of towards the end of
summer so I thought I would do a oh I
thought I would do a kind of end of
summer party makeup look so something
quite bright and still really is summery
but wearable at the same time you can
obviously pet with whatever lip option
you want
I've just got pink going on in the eye
so I thought I would incorporate it in
the lips as well make sure to hit that
subscribe button if you haven't already
and if you like the look of this makeup
look then please keep watching skin
first cuz we're doing a rounded eye
today so I am just priming my skin using
my Nivea post-shave um and just buffing
that into my skin as I always do for
foundation today I'm being a little bit
extra I'm mixing my two favorite
foundations at the moment is the natasha
- no no one and the remarkable full
coverage foundation from Marc Jacobs and
I'm just buffing them into the skin they
are both quite full coverage the Marc
Jacobs one however I just want us to
yellow for me and the Natasha - no no
one it's quite a neutral one so I find
mixed them together gives the best color
and coverage is amazing and because they
are full coverage I do like to just
press it into my skin afterwards with a
Beauty Blender to absorb any excess so
concealer I am it taking this one from
pur Cosmetics it's the invisible ink
concealer in the shade light this glides
on the skin like a dream I'm not even
kidding and it has such amazing coverage
as well so you can see I'm kind of going
for a full coverage look what is new
yeah I'm just a place on that in all the
places that I want to highlight and then
blending that into my skin it with a
damp Beauty Blender just to make sure we
haven't got too much product on our skin
and it's not gonna feel it too heavy or
cakey especially in the summer and the
heat and stuff you don't want to feel
like you're literally sweating or
dripping off thick makeup so I find
definitely going over the skin with a
Beauty Blender like every step of the
way just make sure that everything is
kind of pressed into the skin then this
is obviously my summer must-have I'm
gonna set my face my RCM a powder then
for a bronzer I'm going in with the
peaches makeup medium to dark a bronzing
powder and just using that all over my
skin I'm not using a creams today just
because I think
powders last a little bit longer and
then for blush I'm at taking this
gorgeous luminous blusher from Becca in
the shade Tiger Lily
it's like a peachy coral color which is
gonna read tight in with the eye makeup
for highlight I'm really loving at the
moment using a cream and then a powder
so I'm just taking this strobing stick
from Maybelline in the shade meat I
think it's like medium nude glow and
pressing it using my finger just so that
warms up the product and it blends a lot
easier onto the skin and yet just using
a dabbing motion and pressing it onto
the tops of my cheekbones and then going
in it with this trolls matte collection
Beauty powder in the shade glow Rider
just for a really soft highlight
and then just dousing myself in mac fix+
just to make sure we aren't looking to
powdery and then moving on to the eyes I
am going back in with this palette
haven't used this in ages this at the
makeup sleek money anyway palette and
taking the shade Aegis and cream as our
initial transition color as you can see
it doesn't show up massively on the skin
but we don't I personally didn't want a
kind of intense color to start with
because it makes it much easier to blend
so I'm going in with a slightly darker
color I've listed them down below I
can't remember what this is at the
moment but then going back in with our
fluffy brush that we use to beat some
cream on you can see it just really
effortlessly it blends that out then
using the NYX ultimate brights palette
in this color here I'm just using that
to further deepen up the socket and I'm
just going to continually alter and
change between the three brushes that
I've been using just to make sure
everything it blends as seamlessly as
you can see
then using quite a precise fluffy brush
I'm taking this color here and using
that to kind of cut my crease out softly
but it's not gonna be a cut crease lip
as you'll see but yeah just keeping that
kind of quite low down and going back in
with all my fluffy brushes to make sure
it's all blended out
taking the pain sleep ain't brought from
Mac I'm gonna use this all over my lid
and kind of use that to clean up any
mess on the lid and almost create a cut
crease lips but like I said it's not
gonna be a cut crease look I just really
like the appearance of having a really a
clean lid space so I'm just using that
as a base and then it going in with it
this color here as our lid color and
just pressing that on the top
going back in with that brush just not
with any extra product on just using
that to define the crease and kind of
make it a bit softer then dipping into
that middle transition color I'm just
pressing that onto the outer part of my
eye just so like you would a normal
smokey eye just so everything it blends
together and I'm doing it the same a
little bit I'm doing the same emotion
with the peach color as well as you can
see just creating that gradient across
the lid so it is kind of a good cut
crease but then the outer part blends in
I don't know I was really kind of
feeling this look then I am going in
with this glitter from Sigma called
bewitched
I think it's discontinued but Mac reflex
pink is exactly the same and I have
linked that down below then I'm just
highlighting my inner corner with the
same color we used on our lids and then
applying it this to my waterline this is
the chroma graphic pencil from Mac but
any nude pencil will do I just find this
one to be the most pigmented and this is
gonna really open up our eyes and make
them appear brighter and then again
taking that middle transition color and
running that along with my lower lash
line as something a bit softer and too
tied the look together you could take
the pink down there if you wanted to
then I asked you guys watch lashes to
use and you guys all said Miami Lily
lashes and I'm in love of them I've had
them before and they'll honestly it some
of my favorite lashes now onto the lips
I'm taking this lipstick from Anastasia
Beverly Hills it is in the shade it's
sweet so I think to tie it in with the
eye look you can obviously go for a nude
or maybe like a coral e color it's
totally up to you but I did didn't want
to leave it like a matte bright pink
so I do go in with a gold and a gloss
this is the l'oreal dazzle gloss in the
color disco ball quite similar to the
skinny dip lip top-up from shu a but
it's not as pigmented if you want like
an honest opinion but yeah and that is
the finished makeup look I really hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial give it a
thumbs up if you did and let me know if
you recreate it below on Instagram and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
