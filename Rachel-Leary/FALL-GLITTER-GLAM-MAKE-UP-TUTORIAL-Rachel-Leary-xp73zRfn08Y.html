it is now autumn so the full makeup lips
are gonna be in full swing I didn't ask
you guys if you wanted like a
back-to-school makeup look or a full
makeup look first and all of you guys
said fall but do let me know if you do
want to see back-to-school cuz I feel
like that maybe isn't for a couple of
weeks anyway so let me know in the
comments down below but yes I wanted
this to be like a full glam shebang with
it being the fastball up thang doing I
wanted to go all in
I went like a copper sparkly eyeliner
and I've had it with you like the most
gorgeous brown lip which is part of the
l'oreal Balmain collection so if you
guys have like seen the hide for that
collection you can see what this looks
like yeah went the super dewy skin as
well I'm literally obsessed with this
look especially now with my dark hair I
feel like I can get away with them a lot
more so I really hope you guys love the
look of this makeup look any of you do
definitely make sure to hit that thumbs
up it means so so so much to me that you
do so definitely make sure to do it
now-now-now definitely make sure to hit
that subscribe button as well for more
full looks to come and obviously other
videos and especially if you're new to
my channel I want to see you come back
so definitely make sure to hit that
subscribe button
but yes without further ado if you want
to know how I achieved this look then
please keep watching already gone ahead
and done my brows I've done them loads
of times previously in video so check
back them for the details on that but
I'm going to be using this palette from
pur cosmetics I've left the name of it
down below and just taking this well
actually those two shades to kind of
create a warm brown as our initial
transition color and then further
deepening at the crease with a slightly
softer darker Brown you guys know the
drill obviously going back in with my
big fluffy brush to make sure that it is
all that blended seamlessly it together
and then I'm taking this a darker brick
brown color to further deepen up the
crease and again just going back in with
my fluffy brushes to make sure they're
all blended together and then applying a
bit of concealer that I'm planning to
use on my face on my lid and I'm just
using that to cut out the crease because
I'm going to keep the lid shade matte
and I wanted it to really stand out
because it is just gonna be like a cream
color and it's this one here from the
same palette and I'm just packing that
on with a flat shader brush and then
going back in with that brick color
on a fluffy brush to diffuse the two
together then taking a matte dark brown
from the same palette on the outermost
part of my eyes and then going back in
with my big fluffy brush and making it
all blend together seamlessly to kind of
create our smoky eye and then I'm
highlighting my inner corner with the
highlighter that I planned to use and
then just cleaning up underneath my eye
and creating that winged out shape kind
of aiming towards the tail of my brow so
for eyeliner I'm gonna take this
metallic brown one from a makeup forever
I've left the name and number of it down
below this is just gonna kind of act as
a base but I didn't want to use black I
wanted it to be a warmer so I thought
why not use a metallic Brown and I've
never used this before but I am gonna be
creating that glitter liner using the
Too Faced glitter glue and there's a
copper Allah glitter from violet Voss
I'm taking these two brushes I'm using
the eyeliner brush from Mac to apply the
glue and then a angled brush to apply
the glitter just because I find the
angles of both allow me to be really
precise so the angled brush allows me to
be precise with the glitter placement
and the other one allowed me to be
precise with my blue placement so once
we've done that I'm just gonna use a
wipe to clean up under night under knife
underneath and really sharpen up that
liner and for lashes I'm using the lily
lashes in opulence because they're super
fluttery and aren't too full so we can
still see everything going on on the
lids so if the skin I thought I would
include my skincare so these are the
Nippon fab cleansing pads I've left the
names of everything down below like
always and then I'm taking again from
Nippon fab they're toning pads so it's
really good to cleanse and tone your
skin before makeup just to remove any
dirt and just kind of help exfoliate and
get rid of any dead skin as well this
also helps to exfoliate these are from a
beauty pie and I'm just going to be
applying a few drops of them to my
finger tips and then massaging them
while massaging it into my skin in
circular motions and they do have kind
of little like exfoliating beads in it
so again really good for your skin and
then I'm applying this a serum and
mixing a little bit of liquid bronzer in
it just to add a bit more color to my
skin and add a really gorgeous glow
underneath my foundation and for primer
I'm taking a new one from YSL this is
they're all ours primer that which I
received the other day I have been
loving this it literally glides onto the
skin and especially when you've done a
really good skin at care routine before
this literally it feels amazing and
Foundation does delete last all day so
now with the based on wool like skincare
done we can move on to foundation and
I'm gonna be using the it NYX turtle
combat drops foundation and I've left
the shade names down below but I did try
and show you that I am a really tan but
I do like to stipple these into my skin
first and then press it into my skin
with a Beauty Blender afterwards and for
concealer I'm taking the all ours
concealer as well this is the same one
that I used on my eye to carve out my
crease I think this is in the shade one
but it doesn't look too too light but
I'm just applying applying this in all
the places that I want to highlight and
as you can see this does help to lighten
up my foundation as well and I'm loving
it the coverage of this and it really
literally it didn't crease at all and I
don't know that's just because it was
the Beauty Blender but I literally love
this I'm going back into an old glam
favorite this is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills at contour kit and I'm just
applying the darkest shade to all the
places that I want to reduce and then to
help blend that out I'm mixing at these
two products together so that liquid
bronze up from Bourjois again and then
another liquid bronzer from a Giorgio
Armani he'd barely need any of this and
this really helps to warm up my skin and
the liquid like illuminating bronzer is
gonna really help create a glow and that
is exactly what I wanted I wanted fresh
glowing bronze skin and then now that's
all the creams we can set it with powder
to finish up up underneath the eyes I'm
mixing these two foiled shadows together
they're from makeup geek I think their
grandstand and flamethrower and then
just going in with a pencil brush to
brush that out but this is the finished
eyes and now we can continue with the
face so I'm using my a benefit hoola
bronzer just to add to the contours and
this is what I've been using to contour
my nose with recently as well and loads
of you been asking me about that and I
just kind of take a fluffy brush and
kind of apply it down the sides of my
nose the brush I'm going into another
old favorite this is the annex ombre
brush it in strictly chic and now for
the exciting part I'm literally using
all at three of the nikkietutorials and
over at highlighters that they've just
come out with and I'm taking it the
bronze one it's you kind of warm up my
face you guys know I love a warm bronzer
and then I'm also taking a liquid
bronzer as a base this one is from a
beauty pie and just buffing that in it
with a clean fluffy brush and then we
can go ahead and apply the other to a
powder highlighters
this one is the slightly more golden
undertone at one Accord it below goes
I'm just
on top of that cream and then finally
I'm going to apply the palest one which
is called a glazed doughnut it's like a
pearl color but on a much smaller brush
and only kind of really applying it to
like the highest point cause I don't
want to too much but just to add to that
extra glow finally for the lips I'm
using it via NYX matte lip pencil I
can't remember the name but I've left
the name of it down below and using the
new lore'l a Balmain lipstick in power
is the perfect dark chocolate brown
perfect for autumn
I'm obsessed so that was the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys

the slightly darker makeup looks at the
moment I feel like with the new hair

much better so if you didn't already
