today I am doing a as you can obviou
tell by the title a try on clothing haul
with all items from fashion over they
are such like a massive Instagram
clothing brand I'm sure you've seen
pictures of people wearing them that
loads of fashion bloggers where their
stuff is so so nice like there are so
many amazing products in so many
different colors of like each one the
stuff that they have is like really on
trend as well so I got a bunch of stuff
from there and yeah this is like my
first clothing try on haul that I've
done on my channel so make sure to give
it a thumbs up if you want more of these
and I do have a at 15% of a discount
code which is my name Rachel and I'll
leave that in the description down below
as well as I've listed all the names of
the clothes that I'm showing you as well
so you can just copy and paste it in to
their website and find what I'm talking
about
so let's go ahead and get started so I
got three like bomber jackets and
they're all quite similar but I'm such a
bomber jacket theme especially these
ones they're super lightweight and
they're kind of different colors than I
would normally would have because I've
got quite a few but they're quite thick
and when you go on a night out sometimes
you just look like a lightweight jacket
so I got ones that I thought would go
with lots of things so are obviously
insert clips of me wearing them and
trying them on and starting them or
whatever but I got this one and this is
the colossal jacket in the color taupe
so it's like a brownie nude color and it
almost has like stripes that almost look
like the adidas stripes but it's just a
really nice light weight on the jacket
and I thought I wear a lot of black all
of the time just like leggings and a
t-shirt and stuff and then I have like
my white I have quite a few like white
shoes that I like to wear so I thought
this would be a nice jacket to wear as
nude goes with everything and it's got
like obviously the pop of white with the
stripes and the detailing on it is like
a really pale gold so if I was gonna see
where any joy at probably gold jewellery
but yeah I am upset they have it so so
many bomber jackets on their website
it's crazy and I know they do this one
and all the other ones I'm going to show
you in different colors as well so that
one the
how the description was called taupe and
I got this one and it literally looks
exactly the same but it's not got the
stripe and this one is called the
picture me rollin jacket but this color
is called car key apparently but to me
it's quite this is the same kind of
color it's that light brown nude color
but this time this one has like pockets
down the side more like your classic
bomber jacket again the same kind of
like gold detailing I thought this one
would kind of go if I didn't really want
to have like because down to me it's
kind of more like a sporty jacket type 5
why's this one I thought I could wear
with other stuff because it hasn't got
the stripe down the side so I thought I
might as well get this one
the final jacket that I got is called
the 2-time a bomber jacket in the color
or lid so it's like that to me I thought
this is more of a khaki color but it's
obviously that like olive green and it's
got like a double zip detailing like
these two don't actually do up like a
normal one is just a nice describing it
like a double a double zip and then it's
got pockets at the front and on the arms
as well and I didn't actually own a
coffee colored bomber or olive green
colored bomber jacket and I really like
this color at the moment I think it goes
with a lot of things and like I said I
wear a lot of black and like white and
just quite plain colors so this kind of
adds a little bit of color into whatever
I'm wearing next up I got some body
suits if you guys follow me on Instagram
and stuff you guys know I'm obsessed
with body suits I and also if you're my
friend you know I am obsessed with body
suits I have so so many so I thought I'd
pick up some more because they have such
an amazing range of polities honestly
their websites like the perfect casual
and going out one-stop shop so the first
one I got was a bit different for me
it's like a halter neck one so this one
is called the babydoll bodysuit in the
color ivory I know that they do this in
a black as well
and it's like a halter neck like this
obviously you'll see when I try it on
I don't think you can really wear a bra
with this oh I don't haven't filmed me
trying these on yet so I wonder what
I'll have done y'all have seen anyway
but yes so it has like a low back as
well and yeah holders around the top a
bit risque but I normally I quite like
body suits like this yeah I thought this
wasn't really nice of you just going out
with like high-waisted jeans in a jacket
or like a
pencil skirt or something yeah I really
like white when you've got a tan as well
even though I've got to make sure you
wash it off otherwise this is getting
stained and the other body suit I got is
called at the block party body suit and
I know they did this in other colors as
well but I got it in black I'm obsessed
I saw the snails like I have to get it
it's long-sleeved and it is kind of
see-through like it's a checkered mesh
so you'd have to get your positioning
quite accurate if you didn't want to
wear a bra with this but I think like
it's the kind of bra
it's the kind of bra it's the kind of
body suit that would look nicer just
like a plain slap bra underneath or bra
underneath and I think this is look nice
again with like high-waisted jeans or
like a body skirt which is probably how
I've styled it because that's the kind
of look I like to wear and yet it's like
plain but it's like got detailing going
on so I like stuff like that so I don't
feel so plain if I was to wear like all
black because it's a bit more than just
black Jan I mean I feel like I'm just
rambling but if you can't tell I love
this one next time I got this like
romper or clay suit and I got it mainly
for the style and the color this color
is like the colors that I love to wear
on my eyes it's called rust on the
website I think and it's called their
private party weekend romper but I've
got this many holidays I thought imagine
this was like a tan a bronzed I look
like this was just so at my street and I
love they're like slinky material I
think this would be really cooling on
holiday as well and it's got quite that
a low back as well and it's a short one
yeah I just saw this and I fell in love
it's like I said mainly for the color
but the styling is well I think super
flattering so love this one next up was
a pair of jeans I basically got another
pair of high-waisted white skinny jeans
I let you think that's what it's called
on the website I think they're like the
superhighways skinnies in the color why
I know they did them in other colors as
well they're jeans is actually what I'd
heard the best about if you follow them
on Instagram and stuff they're jeans
just look like they hug you in just all
the right places and they're super
flattering as well and I really like
white jeans because I think I know it
just they're so simple but for summer I
think they're a bit more wearable and I
feel like white makes your butt look
bigger as well so what a bonus they
some of the most comfortable jeans I've
ever worn speaking of comfort they did
have like a range of almost ex
sportswear so I picked up some like
leggings you guys know um I like going
to the gym and stuff so I thought I
would get a pair of leggings I quite
like ones of like a bit of pattern I
think it adds some excitement and also I
love getting new sports because it
motivates me to work out so it might got
like funky leggings like this then I'll
be more inclined to work out I think I
think a lot of people feel that way yeah
these are just gray and a black and this
is the front and then it's just plain
grey at the back so they're only really
that pattern like wraps on the front and
then it's got these stroke details down
the side and they're high waist as well
they've got like an elastic e-waste here
so they kind of grip pretty nicely onto
you and I've already worn these to work
out and they were really comfortable so
yeh when this one arrived I was so
unsure and then I tried it on and I
literally fell in love it's literally
just a plain black pencil skirt but it's
like that bandage material so I really
thought like oh god like is this going
to fit and it did have to like wiggle it
over my butt but when it was on it
literally clings in all the right places
and only you can go wrong with a plain
black pencil skirt I think this one on
the website is called the lux pencil
skirt and it's made of that bandage
material so it's like really stretchy
but like oh it's just like amazing
obviously I'll show you what it looks
like on I'll probably wear it with like
that body suit or something but yeah it
just hugs in all the right places and I
think this is like super classes like
you can dress it up or dress it down and
it's such a flattering material and just
like you can see it's like this sorta
like comes shaped and it looked quite
big at first also like because when it
comes to skirts I needed to be quite
tight otherwise I think baggy skirts
like well like what was the points not
doing you any favors so I was quite
scared but put it on and it's like I'm
literally another there and that fabrics
and I think they did this in other
colors as well so yeah I just want with
black to play it safe and make sure it
went with everything next up is a
jumpsuit and this is like a all
in 1:1 and I got it in black just
because I think that goes with
everything and it's the most flattering
color um would never really go for
something like this but I think with
summer and stuff like I don't know like
if you just want to put something on but
still kind of look presentable and like
with one of those jackets I think this
is like a super easy outfit to wear and
also just for like lounging around and I
think it's super super comfortable
it's made of that Jersey material and I
definitely think that they did this and
other colors as well like I said I just
got it in black because I think it goes
with everything
yeah it's basically like one giant
legging material and I think these are
like so easy to star like I said you
could probably dress up with like heels
and a jacket or dress it down with like
one of the bomber jackets and trainers
and stuff I think it's just a nice thing
to have and I think I'm probably
actually get this in other colors as
well and the last two items that I got
are dresses now this one I was super
excited for this one's called the
inspiration dress and it looks like this
so it like plunges down in like a V V
shape like so and it's like long-sleeved
it's a really stretchy material but it's
quite thick stretchy so it's super
flattering on the body as well as the
like design of it I think it's super
flattering as well and it's got like a
like a big zip down the back that's open
at the moment when I try it on but I was
so excited for this this to arrive it
like for me it's just so nice I think
this is something I would wear with like
a bright lip and like my hair up or
something
because it's quite the good statement
dress even though it's just black and
white but it's just because of the block
print I think and I think it speaks for
itself so you wouldn't want to draw
attention away from it but yeah I'm
obsessed and I think I want to wear this
out this weekend I love it so much and
the last coding item I got was another
dress and this one is called the Braden
dress now it looks really like like
confusing but I forgot that ordered this
and when it came I was like did I order
that that doesn't look like something I
would order but when it's on it looks so
so nice and it's got this kind of rope
detail around the top and across the
back and the cut and the color of this
is really flattering on your butt BIA I
never really go for like nude colored
dresses I
they look a lot nicer if you've got like
dark hair and more tans and this is
definitely something I'd well when I
bike at my darkest like tanning color I
think this is like a really nice dress
to take on a holiday it's really
lightweight it's kind of really minimal
but looks like a putting effort in at
the same time I'm literally in love of
this color like it's like a Stoney color
I think on the website it's called beige
and it's called the braiding dress and I
know again they did this in other colors
as well if you aren't a fan of this
color and the last thing I got was
actually a pair of shoes these are
called the future heel and there are in
the color car key when I saw these I
died I'm obsessed with them I love the
kind of like wraparound elastic
detailing at the front I think this is
sup this is a really nice shoe to wear
if your outfit might be kind of quite
plain and then a shoe like this is kind
of helps to kind of style up your outfit
a bit more and I didn't actually own a
pair of shoes in this kind of khaki
beige color so and I think these would
look really nice with like white jeans
and like a nude colored top or something
yeah I think they're just such a nice
style shoe and I think they're going to
be kind of comfortable as well cuz
they're not completely flat on the
ground and they're not actually too high
either so I'm super excited to wear
these out I haven't worn these yet so I
wanted to film a whole first just in
case like something happened to them so
yeah I can't wait to wear these but that
was the end of my clothing try on haul I
really hope you guys enjoyed it make
sure to give it a thumbs up for more
clothing hauls in the future I
definitely want to do like a few lip
books and stuff as well and branch more
into the fashion side of things so if
that's something you guys want to see
definitely leave some feedback down
below like I said I've listed all the
clothes that I got the names of them in
the description below as well as my 15%
off discount which is just Rachel so you
