today is an exciting video I am at
reviewing and showing you all the bits
that I got and kind of how I use the
fenty makeup line at by Rihanna I feel
like this has been such an anticipated
makeup line she broody really has tried
and I feel like achieved in
accommodating for everyone they managed
to get a few bits in the collection I've
got the foundation I've got a single
matte skin stick and I got a trio of the
skin sticks which includes a shimmer and
to mattes as well I also got the trophy
wife that kilowatt highlighter which I
feel like has been the biggest rave of
them all I also got one of the heisting
duo's and I got the lip dropper as well
now that isn't the full collection there
was powder which I covered if I didn't
go I was in such a rush I didn't really
realize that she did it but I definitely
wanna get my hands on that in the future
yes she has a powder
there was blotting papers there was
brushes there was also other shades of
the highlighters and the highlighter
duo's there is a 40 I think 40 there
might be more but I feel like 40 rings
about the shades of the photofiltre
foundation ranging from literally people
with white skin so that would be people
that have albino skin she's accommodated
for them and they she has accommodated
for extremely dark skin as well and
literally like every color and undertone
in between so props to Rihanna for
putting the time and effort into doing
that I feel like that's what's been
lacking and that was drawn so so so much
hype around her makeup because everyone
is going to be able to wear this and
also loads of shades of the matte skin
sticks and the shimmer skin sticks and
the trio's I've left the names and the
shades of everything that I have used it
down below and i also do mention them in
the video too so if you think you have a
similar skin tone to me and a similar
skin type i havent normal to dry skin
throughout this video i'm going to show
you the attempts and tricks that i have
personally used to make the most of
these products make them work the best
on my skin and all that good stuff so
this isn't a first impressions video
because like I said I did want to
educate myself before in the best ways
to use these products I wanted to be
able to give my tips and tricks in ways
to make the most
of them I already had high hopes for
them but there are some little tweaks
that I've used in this video to make
them work even better if you like the
sound of this video and the look of this
makeup then definitely make sure to give
it a thumbs up already and hit that
subscribe button for more videos in the
future but without further ado if you'd
like to see how I achieved this makeup
look the products in action and my tips
on how to use them then please keep
watching ok so let's go ahead and start
the makeup tutorials side of things and
I'll see the full at demonstration so
she doesn't have any eye products yet so
I've already done my eyebrows and my eye
makeup and we can move straight on to
skin now as I said earlier there is a
primer in the collection but I didn't
pick that up just because I read the
description and it is definitely more of
like a matte primer and I just know
personally as I have normal to dry skin
I just wouldn't get much use out of that
primer like already and that foundation
is a lot for my skin and like I don't
want to feel too too uncomfortable so I
have gone ahead and a primed my skin how
I usually do you can check back on my
last video because I do show it there
and let my skin care and staff so let's
go ahead and start with foundation so
this is the photofiltre foundation and
when I tried this yesterday oh my god so
first of all I did a swatch on my hand
and at first I did think like for me
right now I am quite tanned when i
swatched on my hand I thought this looks
a tiny tiny tiny bit light but I think
I'm gonna be able to get away with it if
I bronze up my skin etc this is before
that I dread anywhere that apparently it
oxidizes a little bit so I got the shade
at 290 and I'm so glad I did because
like I said it's the tiniest bit she
likes me to but when it goes onto my
skin it deepens slightly and it's the
perfect color
I'd actually completely guessed but I
know on like trend mood Instagram and
stuff they did a load of swatches and
the Harvey Nichols website that is kind
of like a kind of matching tool I did
completely guess but I have always been
quite good at trying to guess my shades
so if you think you are like me it's a
reference I'm like an NC 35 in matte
shades sort of 66.5 in Georgia Omani
luminous ill-ass and color in the Too
Faced Born This Way like that sort of
color so this does came to be a matte
foundation and honestly it is you as
you'll see when I apply the most
gorgeous coverage matte finish if you
have oily skin I feel like you should
definitely
definitely check out this foundation
it's the way that I like to apply it is
I do a couple of pumps on either side of
my face as you can already see that
already looks like weight you lie and to
achieve at the maximum coverage I always
like to stipple the product in with a
brush first and what I will say is you
kind of need to work quite quickly with
this product because it's a matte finish
therefore it is quite dry and you can
see that was just like two pumps and
like my full face is covered I look like
a green right now but I swear this color
does match me you want to see the
picture on my Instagram yesterday yeah
you also want to work quickly because it
does oxidize and if you don't actually
know what oxidized means when people say
a product oxidizes it means that once
it's exposed to like the air and oxygen
and all that kind of stuff the color
darkens like on your skin
I'm just gonna make sure I'm blending
that down my neck and into my ears so
I've just kind of it stippled that into
my skin and I'm gonna zoom you in and
show you what the coverage and the
finish of this looks like bear in mind
like I said I have primed my skin
exactly how I did it in my previous
video like all the skin care which
actually involves mixing a serum and of
a liquid bronze illuminator underneath
my skin and also using quite a hydrating
primer yeah I'm just gonna zoom you in
now before I stipple it in with a Beauty
Blender and just show you what it looks
like when it's applied with a brush so
this is called a photo filter foundation
and I have to say when I posted my
picture on my Instagram yesterday I like
didn't even need to touch up at all this
foundation is no joke she like this is
like Photoshop in a bottle I'm not even
kidding and I have a little bit of like
a like luminosity just coming through
that I believe is just gonna be from
like my skin care because this does
claim to be a and matte foundation but
as you can see wait hold on I'm gonna
zoom you back out I'm gonna kind of keep
it at this kind of angle as you can see
it if it is time to darken up on my skin
and match me a lot better so for that
reason I recommend maybe going one shade
above the shade that you think you are I
was convinced
got the shade 300 so one two ninety
arrived I was a bit like dammit but now
I'm so happy that I did that because
yeah like I said this does darken up
slightly and probably drops at least one
shade like I said I'm now just gonna go
ahead in and kind of press the
foundation into my skin with a damp
Beauty Blender this is just gonna absorb
any excess product and also just give me
a Brady just smooth finish okay so that
is all pressed into my skin so again I'm
just gonna do a close-up and show you
this foundation because it is no joke
guys this is so airbrush Ness and a
bottle I mean where are the floors like
where do you not I mean this is amazing
okay so moving on to kind of concealer
cream bronzing all that kind of stuff so
like I showed you earlier I picked up
one of the amount skin sticks in French
vanilla and I plan to use this as a
concealer you can buy all of these like
individually or they do come as trios
and I did get the tan trio I think which
comes with one of them matte skin sticks
in a caramel and that skin stick in
truffle which I'm gonna use for contour
and a shimmer skin stick in rum which is
like a bronze shimmery color so when it
comes to contouring I am gonna be mixing
it these two together and I am gonna
take via French vanilla shade underneath
my eyes as a concealer now because these
are a matte finish at first
when I did kind of like one side of my
face cuz this is how I was testing it
yesterday
they wouldn't not like hard to blend but
like I said with matte products you do
have to work quite quickly so I found a
way to kind of make these work better if
you have an or to dry skin like me if so
I apply these where I want them to be so
this Frenchman in the shade is
definitely more like the yellow and tan
which is what I love in like my under
eye concealer and the coverage of these
is buildable so at first it's kind of
like a light load to medium coverage and
then you can like apply layers with
these so that's my kind of concealer
done and why I'm gonna do is is take a
hydrating facial spray so this is a
coconut milk you missed facial mist from
too cool for school I have used them
before and what I am gonna do is just
spray my skin with
and then blend it out with a beauty
blender what this is going to do is kind
of add hydration to that product and
make it a lot easier to blend it was
I've done that like I said I'm gonna go
with my damp Beauty blender and blend
this out and like I said this just adds
a moisture back into the skin but also
to the product and make it just a lot
easier to blend but without ruining your
makeup because it is a facial like Wiz
it this spray in particular tends to
hydrate and refreshes makeup so that's
exactly what we wanted to do I don't
want to use a setting spray that's not
the product that I'm after at this point
I'm not ready to set my makeup I just
want to rehydrate it give it some life
back and just make it easier to blend
out but if you have oily skin I feel
like the natural oils of your skin will
still come through these products and
will might make it you might not need to
add a facial spray to be able to blend
it out for me because like I say I have
no longer dry skin this is how I find to
get the best use out of that product if
I had done like a first impression video
and just gone straight in with that and
tried to blend it out I would have said
like that's quite dry I don't know
what's going on there it is quite dry
but it's dry but it's workable you can
use other products to make it work like
the Anastasia Beverly Hills cream
contour kits on their own really dry and
they don't do anything add a bit of oil
amazing that was just like a tip it's
like a makeup artist tip to just get the
best out of their products ok so like I
said I'm gonna take the two shades
truffle and run the truffle is a matte
shade rum is a shimmer shade now this is
a little bit dark for me but mixed with
the rum I do get like a nice warmth so
I'm just gonna apply this to obviously
all the places that I want a hollow so
that's my cheekbone and then just along
my jawline and then I'm gonna take the
rum shade which is the shimmery shade
and kind of use this along my forehead
and above that kind of because I really
want like a really a bronzy shimmery
skin look today and that darker shade
all above hair just really it's like a
bit too dark for me so this is just
gonna give me a really nice shimmery
bronze you guys know I love a shimmery
bronze so this was definitely a shade
that I wanted to pick up and then I've
used the matte one to contour like
around
again I'm gonna go in with that facial
spray for spritz of this one in
particular almost just like yeah it's a
mist it's not like a prop whoop spray
the Urban Decay's setting sprays they
give you a proper of like product on
your face and it like Topsy sucks and
your skin makes your makeup last that's
what that's perfect for this is
literally a mist so just applies like a
light I don't know like coat like mist
so I don't mind going in with this again
my face isn't getting too wet if that
makes sense I'm really loving this to
help blend out my products to blend them
out I am gonna be taking a duo fiber
stippling brush and probably going in
afterwards with my Beauty Blender
because the only blender is dude the
most so now and yokai said I'm just
gonna bend backwards what I really like
about these kind of matchstick shades
like the matte ones for like the contour
is she did a lot of warm tones and a lot
of cool tones so you can use the matte
shades as like a bronzer around but also
there's cool tone ones that you can kind
of contour with I think the slightly
paler shade range offered slightly
cooler tones so as you can see there's
like that added moisture from the spray
these a lot easier to blend out and the
color of them I feel is really subtle
it's not too warm when I first saw that
match the dark matte shade I thought
like I really want to dark there but
when they blend into the skin and to the
other products and combine all together
I think for me these have been really
kind of like good color choices so once
I like initially it blended all of that
out like I said I'm just gonna go in
with my Beauty Blender and make sure
there's no excess product on the skin
everything really is blended out okay so
I have blended everything out I am gonna
zoom you in again I have not set
anything with powder yet I just want to
zoom you in and show you the finish of
everything that's been placed on my face
so foundation vanilla french vanilla
matchstick as concealer the truffle
matte skin stick and the rum shimmer
skin stick so I applied the rum shimmer
skin stick to my forehead as you can see
I've got like a really subtle glow and
wants
on I applied the mat skin stick in
truffle here and also use a bit of rum
to a blend on either side and obviously
it used the amount shimmer the matte
skin stick on my chin area as well so
this is also again without any powder
now I probably could get away without
wearing powder today but I'm looking at
the weather it's pretty sunny I know I'm
about to be running around a lot off
this site I'm gonna go ahead and set my
face with powder just gonna go ahead and
set it with a translucent powder this is
to be Too Faced Born This Way
translucent setting powder so like I
said I'm gonna go ahead and set that I
am gonna add a couple more bronzing
products just to kind of add a little
bit of definition like I normally would
do but this is what it looks like on its
own but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and set
my face with powder and a couple more
bronzing products and then we can get on
it to it the highlighters and the lip
okay so I've gone ahead and added that
the extra facial products I want to use
which was just like a little bit more of
a bronzer to set that in place powder on
my face and a little bit of blusher now
we can move on to the highlighter so I
got kind of two highlighting of products
I got my hands on the highlighting duo
and this is in mean money and hustler
Berber and it's literally like a really
gorgeous iridescent rose gold so I'm
gonna go in with this secondly because I
died when I saw this highlighter like it
kind of scared me a little bit but I
knew I had to get it I've seen this on
people with slightly more tan skin and a
darker skin it looked stunning so I
wanted to get my hands on it and see if
I could find a way for me to wear it so
this one is the highlighter in trophy
wife it is a gorgeous yellow gold I had
never seen anything like it so I
definitely wanted to check it out I have
like coordinate my top with it today so
the brush I'm gonna be using it to apply
it is the morphe of five eleven brush
which is a kind of big fluffy brush and
I'm going to place this as like my base
highlight and then I'm gonna go in with
that duo so I'm kind of swelling my
brush around and tapping off the excess
so as you can see it is a very light
yellow and at first I was a bit like I
can't wear this like I'm not going to be
able to get away with it
so I just tapped off a little bit more
and now I'm just kind of using the brush
to blend it in and the more you kind of
buff it in the more it blends and it
becomes a bit more of a wearable color
they do do a paler shade called a moon
glow I think we're just part of the
collection but this just gives the most
gorgeous warm yellow undertone really
golden so Rihanna like I really love
that color again just gonna do it the
same on this side and taking it a little
bit up on here so when the Sun hits me
I've got that golden glow kind of
hitting me all over look at that I just
think oh it's so pretty it's not to like
the literary either I'm just gonna place
that trophy wife shade on my nose as
well and just on my Cupid's bow obsessed
but now like I said I'm gonna go in with
the duo I do a feel like one side is
slightly more of a matte highlighter I
know that sounds really weird but it has
definitely just more of like the glow
element to it whereas this side has more
of the shimmer hop in highlights side to
it so that's the side that I'm going to
use so in this particular case this one
is hustling a baby I'm gonna take it on
a map 2 to 4 so I'm gonna place this
like directly on the top so you'll see
what that trophy wife shade looks like
as a base highlighter and then you kind
of might see what I mean when I'm going
in with a lighter shade on the top do
you see well I mean it just kind of
makes it slightly more wearable for
people that aren't as tanned but if you
like that yellow color to look keep it
as it is like I like it but for me to
make it something more wearable I just
need to play something on the top I
don't want to get rid of that Unser nut
and that's what I think everyone is so
drawn to is that gold undertone lips she
reminds me of like sunset Bahama Beach
Caribbean so like I said so Rihanna but
I'm just gonna be applying a lighter and
this one has a slightly rose gold finish
to it which kind of helps work with that
yellow shade I feel ah so that is what
the highlighters kind of looked like
layered on top of each other and I'm
just I'm obsessed with that combination
together I literally feel like I am
glowing so she didn't come out with
lipsticks as such but she did come out
the universal lip topper and this is in
fenty glow so it's literally kind of
like a medium tone nude lip super it
does have cut a path to it so I thought
I would show you what it looks like on
its own and then on top of a lip
combination that I would personally wear
so I've kind of wiped off majority of
the foundation but just kind of gone
over with a Beauty Blender so I'm just
going to show you what it looks like on
its own the applicator is really thick
which is applies a really gorgeous like
lover also it smells so yummy like
strawberries so that is what it looks
like on its own as you can see it's like
a really gorgeous peachy shimmery gloss
it is advertised it's like a universal
lip topper so I feel like it's just
basically meant to go over any lip color
that you want and just kind of add a
little bit of warmth little bit of
shimmer a little bit of a good taste in
your mouth cause it tastes and smells
really good you know me I do kind of
like a slightly lighter nude so I wanted
to see what this look like over one of
my favorite matte lip combinations for a
nude that's slightly lighter because I
knew this would darken it slightly so I
thought I wanted to try that out so I'm
gonna go ahead and show you what that
looks like okay so I'm gonna go ahead
and line my lips with a matte strip-down
pencil and then I'm gonna go ahead and
apply the Tarte artists lip paint in
salty which is a really pale and matte
nude and then I'll be back and then I'll
show you what the lip top it looks like
on top okay so this is kind of more of
the nude or shade that I normally wear
and it is a matte and I do always like
to go in the glosso I am gonna give the
fancy glowing lip illuminating lift over
again and just show you what it looks
like now on top of a matte lip option so
as you can see it darkened up that nude
is slightly and gave it a bit more
warmth which I really really like and
obviously it gave a gorgeous shimmery
glow to it but yeah that is all the
products I have in the collection so I
will show you kind of the finished
makeup look so this is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this look and my thoughts and my
kind of tips throughout this video based
on my kind of skin my kind of skin tone
and my skin type all that kind of stuff
I hope this really helps you if you guys
want to get your hands on the fence
production and you think that your skin
is like mine kind of a better way to
utilize the products and maybe what
colors to get as well I know I didn't
manage to get my hands on everything
