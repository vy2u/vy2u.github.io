excited today to be using the new naked
heater palette from Urban Decay
I literally where for the first pictures
of this palette coming out I feel like
everyone and their mother literally went
batshit crazy because who the hell
doesn't love a warm tone eyeshadow
palette like please the packaging and
the whole collection is literally
absolutely stunning and you're going to
see me in this video trying out there
was a lot of mixed reviews up until this
point so this is just my opinion on
earth so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and the look that I created
are use a bunch of new stuff so there's
a few first impressions in here too
so definitely make sure to it show you
support and give this video a thumbs up
and leave me a comment and definitely
and make sure to hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already because I
would love to see you in my next video
and yes without further ado if you'd
like to see how I use it be a new and
naked heat pallet what I think of it and
then just this whole look in a general
barren if you watching
okay so even though this is kind of
first impressions for the palette I have
a few new products later I don't think
I'm actually used in tutorials yet so
it's a few new first impressions and the
first one is going to be my moisturizers
and this is the catcher water cream oh
my god I love and so my confident I love
any sort of oh come on
again I love any sort of moisture eyes
that has a really like wet feel to air
and I've used this one a couple of times
but I thought in case some of you are
kind into your luxurious skin care or
like to spend a bit more on your skin
care and you have dry skin I definitely
recommend this one although even though
it's water-based I feel like this one
actually specialized in oily skin like
combination skin which doesn't make
sense because
it has a lot of time duration to it and
that helps kind of disperse the oils all
around your skin without like kind of
blocking them is that make sense in a
lot of primers and stuff that I'm meant
for well your skin can be some of those
like smoothing ones and then there's
that just kind of like blocks the oil
which is good to a certain extent but it
doesn't really like help
so this moisture honestly it feels so
good well as you can probably already
tell we are doing our skin start but
else you haven't really if you wanted
winged or going out and you also glow
now almost we said blown out which I'm
kind of happy about because that's kind
of my favorite I'll look at the moment
but for primer I'm going to take the two
o'clock blur primer now I've got this is
a little sample on the beauty box but
you might have seen on my snapchat
but yesterday I went to a or Wi-Fi event
and they actually give me the full size
which I'm so happy about because this is
amazing it has like little gold reflex
in it and even though I would say I have
like a normal to dry skin I don't feel
like this looks paws anything like that
it doesn't like not feel hydrating my
skin it feels just so soft and then
anything I put on the top literally just
like glides on perfectly so I'm just
puttering that into my skin like I
usually would but yeah I haven't used
this in a tutorial because I'm only
recently been testing and see now my
makeup laughs in it I'm really impressed
I mean it doesn't leave like the gold
speckles on your face which I'm kind of
sad about in a weird way but it feels so
soft in the combination of that primer
and the moisturizer literally it leaves
my skin feeling like a baby's butt as
you can see my face is a lot paler than
my body right now so I'm going to use a
old fade this is the Studio Fix fluid
foundation this is in the shade on it
mc40
to match my turn and my skin is kind of
bad at the moment it's because I slept
in my makeup last night
don't ask I'm so upset about it but it
always happens and that's why I don't do
it and do that I didn't intend to do it
as an accent but I'm just going to be
applying this all over my face because
this and you haven't tried it although I
feel like if you're looking for a go-to
foundation
a night out and you still haven't found
the right one Studio Fix always a go-to
for me I don't know why I just look
really good in pictures as a really nice
coverage it's like medium to full you
can really build it up and work with it
the annoying thing is the shade ranges
are very likely the very yellow or quite
pink so it is one of those foundations I
wear like after I've faked and or
something so I've got that yellow
undertone going on yeah I haven't used
this in ages and I kind of wanted this
to be like a full like full glam
actually whoo hell am I kidding of
course I want to be foreground and like
I said this foundation just gives such a
good coverage and I feel like it always
has a really nice finishing looks good
I'm going to make sure to get your in
okay now we are sufficiently at fixed up
I'm going to use the L'Oreal True Match
concealer in the shade vanilla and
that's going to help lighten up my
foundation a little bit and that really
brighten up underneath my eyes and I
really love the consistency of this
concealer I don't know if you guys saw
when I used it in my drugstore at first
impressions the first time I literally I
couldn't believe I'd not used it before
like I love the L'Oreal true match
foundation so it would only make sense
that I would love this concealer and it
is and I really love how like yo the
undertone is on this one just because
that will really up to brighten up
underneath our eyes and it's going to
use my Beauty Blender again and just dab
dab dab and I always like to take I
would like to apply a little bit like
more underneath and then on the Beauty
Blender take it up onto my eyelid and
that way I kind of prime my eyes ready
for the eyeshadow without you know
having to like use another product
because conceals are actually a really
good eye primer okay so now that is all
that blends in I'm going to go ahead and
set everything in place with my powder
but I am going to leave via powder
baking underneath my eyes just because I
did try out this Naked palette like
literally yesterday but I did it in a
way that I didn't really test all of the
colors so I don't know what the fallout
is going to be like so I'm going to
leave
some powder underneath my eyes Justin
get there is fall out and we can catch
it and swoop it away so I'm just going
to go ahead and do that and also what
I'm sitting in place with powder I am
going to go ahead and do my eyebrows and
for that I'm going to use the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in blonde and then
set it all in place with the Loreal at
brow artist plumper in light/medium and
then I'll be back and we can start doing
the iPhone and ice what we are all
excited for so we are back eyebrows are
done and we are baking under the eyes so
now it's time to do the eyes using the
new naked heat palette from Urban Decay
I am so excited for this it comes to the
brush trying to brush it off soon will
try to brush out too - like I said I did
use it which suggests they only is a
couple of crease color so I'm going to
use literally everything from the
palette in this tutorial including lid
colors and everything so I am NOT going
to start with this shade here called
sauce that's pretty fresh is a little
too small for this job that we're going
to be doing always like to use a big
fluffy brush for the initial transition
color when that come out so we're enough
across from coral so let's go ahead and
do this so I saw like mixed reviews on
this because our company or like
magazine had like switched it and made
it lips so on pigmented but I literally
I dabbed my brush in that once look how
much has come off like I think that was
just a bad swatch because I was so
impressed with the pigmentation then
you're going to really go to something
burnt and blown out and it seems
appropriate with this palette so I'm
just going to be applying this both on
each side oh my god you follow me on my
snapchat you will have seen I'm having
literally I feel like everyone in at the
moment the biggest and makeup deeper and
clear out I'm being so strict to myself
and basically saying like I haven't
reached for it in the past couple of
months give it away because I'm
obviously and not using it or like I
haven't wanted to use it if that makes
sense
so I'm it she's gonna have the biggest
player out so it expects a video on a
new makeup collection and a decluttering
video I'm going to be asking you guys
what to do at it because some stuff has
been switched but they're not used and I
feel like you
only donate that but I know some of you
guys have probably wanted I've literally
switched at one time so when that video
comes which hopefully will be in the
next few we stay tuned for that moving
on I'm going to take the color he devil
are we use the Urban Decay brush this
time I'm just taking out Tyler he devil
which is definitely more of like a red
shade and is pro fear how can that
people slate this already I'm sorry I
haven't tried the shimmers yet but the
mats are so pigmented like really really
I think even more pigmented than they're
like old palette so I don't know they've
reformulated the formula of their mouth
shapes but then I'm going to go back in
with the fluffy brush after I just
placed that down just buffing it back
and forth so just applying it kind of
part way across and blending it in I
haven't watched anyone elses review
slash tutorials using this palette yet
so if this is a similar look to
something someone else has done I
apologize that I haven't actually seen
anything yet but I don't think that many
people have it so I'm hoping that no
one's done the same I don't even know
I'm going to be doing yet but let's just
hope I will say though every color that
I've put on comes out a lot darker then
it like appears in the palette that
moment is already a bad thing but just
something that I have noticed thus far
okay so I think I'm gonna continue with
crease colors they kind of want to try
and use as much of this palette as I can
so you can guys get like a full
impression of the whole palette so I'm
gonna go in with this matte shade here
which is called km Cayenne something
like that just apply that again into the
crease I'm just using that same atom
decay brush and just blowing it are you
worried from if you say out like that
calendar is now oh and a buddy I feel
like it sounds like little them as well
as in like in the UK oh I'm a loving
loving loving loving
nice honest thank you honestly I know
people might get bored of warm looks but
because that's what everyone prefers
every eye color suits these born shades
like my eyes don't really suit cool
tones like they just don't bring the
color out I feel like we can make up the
whole purpose of it it's just enhance
your natural beauty so I don't use
comments saying like oh I get you want
me to do it because you might like them
and not and you just want to know how to
do it and that and that's why I do do
them not as much as you guys might want
but when I do do them they offer you
guys I am such a warm girl everyday like
yes give it to me naked Heat okay now
I'm going to start with some of the
crease crease the lid color so I'm going
to take the shade number which is what
appears to be it like a deep coppery
rosy Goldy she's not really that think
undertone to it is definitely like a
gold so for brush I wanna use something
like this this is a matte 2 to 8 and I
find these brushes really good in terms
of like applying shimmers so fingers
crossed with this one I'm going to
concentrate this mainly on the inner
most part of my eye but they do want to
use and one of the other shimmers like
in the middle as the transition I'm
going to see you in a little bit now to
season see okay so it's not as Cherie as
I'd like it to be but it's the color
that you see in the palette it's not
eyes like intense if I want it to be I
don't think which maybe it's visions
that have got people like thinking that
this whole planet is not very pigmented
I think shimmers are the harder I
shadows to like create the formula for
and make them like super intense about
them being like spoiled shadows and
stuff so it doesn't cut it
Vica palette never time to use to be
like super intense shimmer shadows so I
guess for what it is pretty good okay
now I'm going to take it shade dirty
talk which is like it's really really a
shimmery red and I'm going to take just
like a short shader brush like
this and just apply that in between the
the crease colors that we put down and
then that lid shade just so it's like
one whole gradient going across again on
the other one I think I prefer that red
shade you know in the middle and that
looks really free and warm and I love
these Colorado's can you tell yes okay
so now sweeping up the crease even more
I'm going to take this purplish shade
this is called in the flagel I'm just
kind of going to concentrate this on the
outer most part again kind of like
dragging it out a little bit so it's
super super blown out and then going to
go back in with that he devil unsourced
which of the two transition colors that
we used first and just use that to do
fuse and blend it in nicely okay now I'm
going to take a flat shader brush
literally anything with a short for the
show with like a flat top this is the
flat definer from Sigma I own take the
darkest matte color which is called
ashes which is slightly more like 8 per
clear undertone and I'm going to use
this and I compress it into via top of
my lash line just to make one way I
apply lashes like there's a little
something there and to just to make this
a lot more kind of like sultry and smoky
also just a little update if any of you
guys care so I got my gels taken off my
fingers the other day and just got
regular polish and they seemed to not
finally be recovering so I think it must
have been the gel or just like the whole
process of getting the acrylics off just
inflamed it but they're on the road to
recovery guys so I'm not going to be
ugly fingers anymore like that okay so
now I'm just going to wipe away
underneath my eye because you can see a
little bit of fallout therefore I'm glad
that I did keep that part of that okay
so to highlight the inner corner I'm
going to take the paler shade which is
called out just on a pencil brush and
press that to our inner corner just to
brighten it up so doesn't look as if
we've got black lines or anything like
that I always like a bright in a corner
when you've got a blown-out look like
this okay so the naked heat collection
actually came with two of their 24/7
glide-on eye pencils Emily is both I'm
going to take the more dark
patty shade called alkaline I'm going to
run that along my top Washington if that
makes sense like tight line stuff I mean
lovely lovely and then I'm going to take
torch in at my waterline oh my god this
does like everything for me it literally
makes my eyes pop I can tell I'm going
to be using this literally everyday in
my waterline the formula of them as well
is so good they literally do glide on
24/7 oh my god putting a female shining
that she makes my eyes water also
apparently I say water really weird
water water it's not weird I don't know
anyway I'm going to take that he devil
color and and I run this along my lower
lash line and this is just going to tie
everything it together and connects it
all and just smoke out that eyeliner and
I think that is everything for
eyeshadows I'm literally obsessed with
these are colors oh my god and this
palette is so so it's so pretty you are
in the market for a warm toned eyeshadow
palette I definitely would recommend
trying to get your hands on it when it
comes back in store but now to finish
off the eye I'm going to be applying
mascara and lashes and some mascara and
using it the Big Shot colossal mascara
as always and it's and lashes I'm going
to take the Lily lashes in the style
luxe which are wings out but they are
super super wispy and a pretty it so I
feel like there's going to really
accentuate look so I'm just going to do
that and I'll show you if you finished
eyes so if these are the
the lashes on I mean they are still
drying but I'm not pushing for time so
by the time that this finishing is that
they should be fully complete like the
eyes fully it's finished but I love
these lashes with it they're just winged
out and they're super fluttery so you
can still see all the drama going on I
just feel this is such an easy look so
now let's go back to finishing off the
makeup look and go back to the base okay
so a new product that I received
recently it's actually a two faced
chocolate soleil a bronzes I've got a
bunch of them in that giant PR package
much review guys sort and like loads of
people with snapchats but I'm going to
keep me a couple so they will be party
cutter includes me I don't need that
many bronzes come on so I'm just going
to bronze up my skin with this the smell
of these is honestly it to die boy is
literally chocolate and I really like
the undertone of them as well they are
quite more on the like orange ER side
but for a look like this where that's
kind of what's going on on the eyes I
said I get really ties in together and
that's why sometimes I like to use
bronzes in my crease and stuff because I
feel like your bronzer should always
tighten with your eye makeup it just
about every complements and completes
event okay so Russia I'm going to use an
old favor at this time this is the
illuminator a blusher from a Milani and
it's the most beautiful rose gold color
I just thought I don't really want
anything too orangey or to pink to kind
of either one take attention away that
was to oranjee or to be like another
different undertone going on of my face
so I thought this is a really gorgeous
just flash of rose gold and has a very
pretty shimmer to it too and for
highlight again another old favorite it
is the sleek highlighting palette not
Cleopatra's kiss but is the original
Soulstice one oh I'm out and I'm
just going to take this color here and
then it may be a tiny bit of that one on
the top just to make it extra pop in mmm
I feel like being at DJ Khaled you know
if you guys have one snapchat on is
always like to have fun yes boys boys
boys boys
yeah I'm just going to take a little bit
more that yellow
hello and just on top just apply that
anywhere you want to bring out a bit
more yes
now on to the lip I was going to use the
new Urban Decay liquid lipsticks but I
feel like I would rather use one of them
on a more simple I look so maybe let me
know if you want to see maybe with that
palette or more simple eyelet and then
with those kind of bright ready orange
lips so I am going to go ahead and do a
and new - I don't draw any attention
away but I am using at some at new
products that I feel like you guys might
be interested in if you buy a nude gloss
and lipstick a level like me so I'm
going to go ahead and line my lips just
using it stripped down pencil from that
just because it's like this ghost is
every nude ever also a really good
pencil if you like to phone line your
lips because it's of a cooler tone this
and oak both from Mac I like my favorite
for doing that but for the liquid
lipstick I wanted the moon to be more of
like a warm kind of know Walmart nude so
I'm going to be it using the who
deputies liquid lipstick in the shade
so the lot more of like a warmer future
undertone now that this color I love the
formula of the beauty of liquid
lipsticks you just have to wait for them
it too like a dry bit but I feel like if
they dry instantly that's when they're
like really sticky and flaky and that's
not a good liquid lipstick so let's
hurry up and get strong because the Army
of China gloss only because I really
wanted to try this out and show you guys
a lot of you so I had it and wanted to
see what it looked like and it is the
Isle of sake colour-pop ultra glossy
lips in it Kirby oh my god I literally
am obsessed with this literally matches
this liquid lipstick to the team and
when I think I've literally just found
my new nude
my favorite new nude combo you know I
mean oh my god this is like sheer one of
my fav look when you're all going to be
like you do it all the time and I'm like
I know but that's because of my favs but
all the kind of products I will the
foundation I use definitely it was quite
a matte finish foundation and same
always powder the bronzer was not as
well so I'm going to go in and use the
NYX
dewy at finishing mist kisses to at set
everything in place and kind of make
everything appear
bit more like knots in that on my face
that was so nice and refreshing so this
is be a finished makeup ler
so I'm actually like I said I'm BRE and
past with it'd be kind of cruise colors
of the palette I mean the shimmers could
be a lot that Morris generation remaking
more of a foil texture I still think
that they translated just as stunning on
the eyes if you have a HBS blue or green
eyes and I prefer any eye color I feel
like this palette is perfect you so I am
so so so excited for it to be able to
come out officially answer everyone to
be able to get their hands on it because
honestly it is going to be one of my
go-to palettes from now on so this was
the obviously it finish tutorial I
