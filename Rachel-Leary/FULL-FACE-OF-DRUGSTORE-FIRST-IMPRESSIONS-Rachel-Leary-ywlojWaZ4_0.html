today I am doing it this kind of it
turned out to be a really a bronze to
glam look sorry sorry sue I am not
trying to film something after this I
kind of needed my makeup to be done in a
certain way so I hope you guys
appreciate that yes then is a four-phase
of first impressions using all the
products from your kind of local foods
super drug drugstore whatever I tried it
to use some other brands that I don't
really kind of use that often though in
terms of like some skin products and
it's stuff on my eyes and I'm using a
lash brand I've never used before and I
literally another then obviously they're
some of my favorites in here and it's
their new releases that I'm trying for
the first time so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know any other
full face for first impressions you
might want to see if it's just one brand
or high-end or something like that just
let me know in the comments down below
yes if you like the look of this makeup
lip and the concept of this video
definitely make sure to give it a thumbs
up and subscribe for more of these types
of videos and I also just love to see
you in the next video
yes that further adieu if you would like
to see how to get this makeup list then
doofy watching
kind of my face and be a little kitty
for a sec okay so first things first I'm
tired a new moisturizer now I've used
some l'oreal extraordinary facial oil
before and there's a beard I literally
love it so I saw that they did a
extraordinary oil nourishing light oil
cream so miss you mean this is basically
like a royal infused moisturizer going
to be amazing for the skin but what I
loved about it was like it said light
because I didn't obviously want anything
too early on my skin and also it's a
moisturizer so this is going to be what
we're gonna use to prep our skin if one
of those like hmm counsel exists I
always feel like this is wasted product
I might use that but it smells really
like the facial oil of it omigod omigod
huh it feels really good I can't read
ascribe that it's not everyone those
went to skin and moisturizers that I
really like
it feels very nourishing but not too
heavy I definitely agree with it being
like a light moisturizer although that
feels really good it smells really good
feels really good I feel like you you
barely need any of this and it goes
quite a long way and spreads really
nicely across your skin it's quite oil
and whew so it feels very like a massage
gee that makes sense a kind of glides
across your skin oh my god it said
nourishing on the front and that's
exactly how I feel my skin feels really
nourished so I actually like that so far
I almost sort of a cooling sensation on
my skin but I don't know what that means
anyway moving on to primer I'm using a
primer spray I thought that would be a
little bit different and I was
definitely trying to use a few brands
that I don't always use for other
products I mean some of the stuff is
like Maybelline and all that kind of
stuff that I use all the time that this
is primer water from Barry MV if it's
anything like the Smashbox primer water
or the next primer water it is really
good in the sense that if you're quite
lazy in you can't really be asked to
apply primer I know some of my friends
are like that this is quite a quick easy
instant hydration and then also we'll
have some kind of tack to it so make
your makeup last longer and it's a good
one so this is the like it's at the
Barry M flawless Hydra fix primer water
it says for all skin types hydrating
swimming lightweight
pore-minimizing so let's just give our
phase of sprints it smells like a lot of
the other primal roses so fingers
crossed for this one obviously I won't
be able to fully it count until at the
end of it but I always like to just make
sure that all press and I know my skin
feels really good the combinations that
primer and the spray feels really really
nice on my skin like I don't feel like
anything's sat there it's all feeling
good and I'm feeling good ready to apply
my foundation speaking of which a brand
I don't use all the time and if I did it
would be for foundation but then I
thought I've never tried before which is
the Revlon Photoready airbrush effects
foundation so basically it's oil free
fragrance free SPF 20 the whole airbrush
effecting kind of sold me on it so we're
going to try this I've got mine in the
color
0:04 nude mistakenly what kind of word
was that if I knew it I mistake ibly I
think is what I meant to say I thought I
was a lot more talent than I usually am
forgetting that I just kind of showered
before and my scrubbed my tan off so if
this is really dark that will be my
first impression and we'll see I'm just
going to add foot apply it onto my skin
and just blend this in so I think we'll
be okay for color it didn't tell me the
kind of coverage this was so I don't
know how many lives I might need to look
airbrushed but it looks as if it's like
a satin finish but that might just be
because of the oil like the oil but the
moisturizer that I've got on underneath
okay so I did for pump and I still want
a bit more coverage around here and it
didn't even reach my forehead yet so I'm
going in with another one another one
and then on my forehead I mean I am
using a damp sponge
to apply fashion absorb its so so so
much that like I'm getting no coverage
from and I noticed the color spectrum of
this sounded like the color range of
this foundation wasn't great and this
one was the most yellow base when I
think I saw which is why I picked it up
and even to me it looks a little
oh just like neutral we'll see I mean
we'll see how it lasts
sometimes these foundations actually get
better throughout the day all the way
I've got time for it to get better
throughout the day you know but I do
really like the finish of it I'm glad
it's not like a super matte finish or
like it's nothing too too heavy but
actually the finish of this is really
pretty after doing the second layer and
the colors got a bit more yellow as I've
been applying it so we'll see we'll see
we'll see I mean it's not going to be
one that I now instantly grab and it's
an instant fame but we'll see how the
day goes on okay so concealer I was
looking at it and I thought oh my god
I've never tried that before I don't
know why normally I'm stuck I am and
they've linked and seen a girl like I
know that they're going to be great all
of them I like the whole concealers that
they do are doing this one I don't like
so I thought I won't use them because
you don't already know enough then for
branch I use another one I've never used
the L'Oreal True Match concealer before
ever Foundation love it why haven't I
ever used to consider I don't know this
is the it L'Oreal perfect match
oh if the perfect match super blendable
perfecting concealer it'll look like it
was all part of the True Match range but
this is in the color number two vanilla
just got one of those like lip gloss
applicators and what I already know I'm
going to go for a rounded eyes so I'm
just going to be doing about my skin
first
so I oh this is so yellow I love it I
think unless the stand that I was at
just I don't know I misplaced it or
whatever but this is actually the
largest one and it's number two they
didn't there wasn't a section for one
and I feel like there was only like
three colors or something but the
coverage as I'm applying it looks really
pretty and I'm loving the whole yellow
be like undertone
oh my god just look at myself and I look
hilarious okay
so it claims to be a super blendable so
let's see how bendable it is I'm just
going to go in with the same sponge but
use the tapered end this time okay maybe
I've applied a little bit much
okay so you don't need much of this and
maybe I got something to line
I do like quite a bright under-eye but
maybe this is just a little bit too
bright but the coverage is really good
and you know I guess you could say this
is really really blendable as well
and then after rework with this I also
you guys know I like to take up onto my
eyelids as well and give it a bit as
like my little eye primer okay I'm
blending it and it's not looking too
scary anymore come off a tiny bit just
like there by always fun concealers like
you never stay down I don't align but I
just blend out really easily and I'm
impressed with the like the finish and
the coverage of it I think it's really
brilliant for the satin finish I think I
got the shade a bit too bright but I'm
actually quite liking the skin it's not
I'm not feeling too caked in anything
even though I currently might be look
like and felt like I applied a lot of
everything but I would find that dump
sponge make everything feel better but
no this feels comfortable on my skin I'm
liking it I'm liking it okay so I'm
going to use two types of harder today
those are from Maybelline and one of
them I can't believe I hadn't used
before but one of them is brand-new so
just underneath my eyes I need to eat
Maybelline and master fix setting and
perfecting loose powder now I'm really
skeptical about these powders they feel
like HD powder and you guys know like
sometimes they can just be awful like
the flashback is awful you just look
really like white underneath I so I'm
gonna I'm not going to bake with this
I'm literally just gonna set with it so
I'm going to use this translucent one
underneath my eye just like a little
white powder like this I'm going to tap
quite a lot of it off and just kind of
dust it underneath whoa so I'm just
gonna use it to set like my eye area
so this one isn't designed to add
coverage or anything like that if you
want to add coverage stay tuned for the
next powder but note this one is just
like a loose setting powder lightly dust
done so I'm just food kind is where I
put the concealer because I don't want
to add any more coverage to those bits
okay until I take a picture with flash
I'll be able to decide but so far I
think everything fails officially set
like I don't feel like anything for the
move of my face so maybe my VRI I've
learned something really good any but
really skin just to kind of block with I
think that'd be really really great it
definitely feels like it's absorbed love
the shine that was going on in my face
which is C perfect it doesn't claim to
be a HD powder so I'm not expecting all
flashback from it but we'll see and I'll
let you know
note that still set in place but now I'm
just going to set kind of step outside
of my face all what my goal another
product I can't believe I've never tried
before considering I've read so much
about the actual foundation the
Maybelline fit me powder I've never
tried it before I don't know why I feel
like I could do with a bit more color
and maybe a bit more coverage and also I
wanted to try out loads of new things
for you guys so you all might love to
apply face other face powder so this
might be an in favorite if you think it
looks good but I'm using the color 250
might be slightly darker so we will have
to blend down I'm just going to apply
this just to kind of everywhere I didn't
apply the translucent powder okay see
you can tell it's definitely added a bit
more like warmth into my skin and if I'd
applaud that a lot heavier
you'd have been like girl but no this is
really pretty off see I'm like blending
it down my neck as well ah my face
definitely feels
sufficiently set in place there was a
bit more time I could definitely go a
bit heavier with this to add a bit more
coverage but that's definitely only this
on top of that foundation has actually
really made me look pretty damn
airbrushed if I do say so myself anyway
now it's kind of
all set in place before I move on to
other faith products I'm going to fill
in my eyebrows I've been loving the NYX
micro brow pencil for ages the benefit
precise brow it's all brow pencils that
are very thin so I was so happy to see
that Maybelline has come out with the
micro brow pencil as well is there maybe
the brow precise micro pencil and this
is in the color soft brown comes with a
little a little Spoony which is always
helpful I have to get kind of close and
look down but I'm just going to brush
the room and I would like to start kind
of here only but it broke already
maybe the top bit looked a bit funny and
it was just a bit weird but let's try
again the color is really nice it goes
quite nicely with my roots as well I'm
not finding I have to press that hard to
get the color to come out which is
always good clothesline with pencils
like this like I just did even though I
think that was just because the top a
bit with but if you press too hard they
just snaps so easily oh my god it's not
ok so I've done the kind of tear of my
brow the pigmentation of the pencil I'm
finding really a nice this one compared
to the other one I feel there's a lot
wuxia which is not necessarily a bad
thing but I feel that it's why it's so
soft and why it kind of has snapped a
couple of times but the pigmentation is
really really great because especially
for me I always have to fill in the end
of my eyebrow and needs to be a bit more
pigmented I really liked that pencil
actually filling in the front of my
eyebrow I don't know why I feel like
it's remained sharp need to be able to
do that I like that I'm going to go and
scoped out my brow with the same
concealer I'll just take a little brush
to do that and then fill in my other
eyebrow because you see how that one
worked out I'll show you the end result
but no the colors really nice actually
what Norman
soft brown it's warm but not too warm it
doesn't look orange it's just kind of
the perfect amount to go with my boots
so like the color and million that it
kept breaking after what I thought I
didn't really apply much pressure I feel
that just because it's so soft and
pigmented so you're going to win some
you lose okay so I've just done my
eyebrows not gonna lie I'm using like
the best eyebrows I feel like I've done
ages so I scoped them out with the
L'Oreal concealer just a little brush
without precise brow pencil like the
micro brow pencil even it is really
great it didn't break again on the
otherwise I definitely would have
included it but I just love the color
I love how I was able to get a doubt 7th
effect really precisely because some of
my other ones have become a bit blunt
and when I try and feather up it just
kind of looks all smudgy tell me if you
can relate on that like smudgy brows but
this I'm really loving it and now I
count some smiley bedtime okay I'm going
to move on to the rest of my face but
I'm going to wait to highlight so a
bronzer I'm going to take this new at
palette from Maybelline it is their
master bronze color it does contain a
highlighting shade in which I thought I
was going to use but then I saw this
eyeshadow from L'Oreal it's called it's
called lumia I knew I wants to put on my
lid and I haven't watched it yet but
we'll see I might end up using that as a
highlighter which they want maybe I'll
she's both no matter she's both anyway
for bronzer I think I'm going to take a
mix between those two together I might
slightly contour with this and then
bronze with this so I'm going to take
this one and do the bronzing first it's
quite a orange tone bronzer and to me
that I thought I'd pick the definitely
more of like the golden color bronzer so
I feel like this one will be really kind
of orangey so if you're on the fairest
side I probably stick to what this one's
going to be or useful in that I'm using
just a lot lighter
but another shimmery as I thought but it
has got a really gorgeous satin finish
to it which I really really like
not sure we'll need to contour or just
obviously a pile of them now I think
besides the color being I think a little
slightest bit too of an orange your
bronzer that's a pretty pretty palette
and I'm going to take that lighter color
and contour with it's just so I'm using
like the full range and I can kind of
see okay so these they're really
pigmented which is great but not when
you don't want to look like Lots
trucking and placing where is my powder
brush going here I'm just going to buff
that and a little bit you know this one
makes a really nice contour color ah oh
my god so why my line why I learn I'm
just going to look really chiseled and
that's one the big Mankato that was
amazing I just didn't realize how
amazing it's definitely more of a satiny
finish of a bronzer it's not shimmery or
anything like that so just get it some
really cheap use on your face it's not
like that at all it's a power that could
suit everyone and I feel like they're
highlighting shade is slightly too dark
if you're very very fair I've not tried
it yet I'm just looking at it and I feel
like this palette is definitely more for
medium to slightly darker skin tones so
just bear that in mind and you let's
move on to blusher so I'm taking the
master blush color in highlighting here
and this one I'm going to take this
color here for blusher that's really
pretty
I really like that it's what I'm such a
gorgeous glow to it I might just need to
her for them where has it gone it's
going to go over a little bit with my
bronzer brush but no I think that was
just about the right amount of
pigmentation it's a brief gorgeous comic
Rose blush color which I feel like this
one for highlighting would be perfect so
there's a slightly paler slightly paler
skin but I really like that but now show
you that I shadow is the highlighter or
the other one I'm going to use by
comparing them so I thought they will
pick similar that's why this one looks
slightly lighter than this one
on funding going with deck first and
then that one this is the Loreal
eyeshadow in Lumiere oh oh girl that is
really pretty
oh I'm smiling you know and you like
find something that was quite affordable
you know it's not too pigmented either
I'm not feeling like I'm dispensing
loads on my face and it blends really
nicely into my skin as well bulbar noses
it's such a gorgeous golden color gasps
but I shadows colors but now I'm going
to you the card I'm just going to be
trying everything out for you guys I'm
going to try the highlighting shade from
deep bronze palette from Maybelline and
a slightly more defined brush oh yeah
there it is I feel off skin is
sufficiently done that's the foundation
just a little mid video kind of update
the foundation seems to be getting
better the size of my face where I put
that Maybelline powder at the top lips
you look airbrushed it's all staying on
really well really impressive the
eyebrows as well I picked some really
great stuff here guys so if you've been
looking at things to get or anything
like that then definitely some of this
place stuff is really great so check it
out if you haven't already so now let's
move on to the eyes normally I would do
when I first but then that's not really
going to be my true fascination is it so
I'm just going to do the one eye on
camera straight away alright here we are
oh nice
wait what we are nicely we're up close
and personal is what I'm trying to say
Christ right so I think I'm actually is
going to go in with one of the with this
shade from the bronzer palette as my
initial transition color because it's a
really warm brown shade and I was
looking all round the drugstore for a
new eyeshadow palette that had matte
Browns in it and none of them were warm
enough you'll see the one I picked but
again just wasn't warm enough for me so
I'm just going to go in with that
bronzer but I feel like I always like to
use a bronzer as eyes
they're really great and they're always
and warm announcer the yes that works
really nicely in the grease that high
that brow bullet that concealer that I
use I thought was too bright underneath
my eye such a good brow highlight it's
quite liquidy which is annoying so
L'Oreal come out with a true match cream
concealer if you do that now you have it
in first okay so moving on to further
deepen up the crease I've got the Nu a
matte eyeshadow palette so this is the
sixth shade palette of matte soft
Suede's you can see they're all quite of
like a neutral color
nitin with any great warmth to it which
was annoying but i'm going to take this
shade here and use it to further deepen
up my crease but I thought this palette
would be a really great for those that
maybe spur slightly cooler looks and
also for traveling really convenient
size it's literally like the size of my
palm and anyway it's definitely one of
those brands that is so so affordable I
feel like most things are like a pound
or a tiny bit more so you sing it
whenever we get scared about the quality
but so far so shadow is been doing quite
well and the pigmentation is really
great too just annoying about the color
choice I feel like they did do other
palettes like in this shape with
different colors but I wanted a matte
palette and the others I think all
contain shimmers my thought I don't need
them now I'm going to go in with the lid
color so Laurie I'll come back so
L'Oreal Lumiere I shadow again never
tried like L'Oreal single shows before
and then I saw that when I saw all that
would make a bomb highlighter and also
lid shade so let's get it back get any
of you guys ever watch that what was it
um let's get some shoes oh my gosh shoes
are you freaking love hair and I can't
think boys name is sorry I'm trying to
brush it again just gonna take a little
shader brush and pack
but yeah I freaking loved him he did the
muffins thing as well you guys remember
what that guy is called please let me
know in the comments or have you ever
used to watch that too so I always find
we've pressed single shadows so I mean
they're not great I didn't want to get
like a berry n pig Muslim because I've
used them before and this isn't like not
great don't get me wrong I'm just having
to apply a good few layers to be able to
get the color that I want it just
doesn't look as sparkly on my eyes you
know I mean I suppose that's still like
a pretty it's almost a paired more
bronze on my eye then gold it was
definitely more like you can see that
like gold on my face definitely prefer
that more as a highlighter than an
eyeshadow with no rules that says just
because that says it's an eyeshadow you
can't use as a highlighter because hello
I now I'm going to take the darkest
Brown from the palette and just use that
on my outer most part and like along the
lash line a little bit because I bought
new lashes as well to try a brand I've
never used it's like a style interview
that the whole brands I've never used I
think you guys gonna really like them
yeah I'm just pressing that into the
lash line and then back up into my
crease like that okay and now for
mascara I've been at dying to try this
mascara is the Maybelline a Big Shot
mascara I've seen this all over in like
America and stuff I'm hoping you guys
can get it now looks really great and
one that I'm really going to enjoy so
here we go
I knew I was going to love this brush I
know
look how separated they are if they're
like let me try it I'll apply another
coat you know I don't normally like to
apply huge amount of scar by now I'm
going to be going in with eyelashes ah
that's so good only but I love it okay I
just ran out of my Maybelline the
falsies mascara and then they gave me
this and now I feel like this is going
to be my new go-to
as someone that always wears false
eyelashes unless I've got a really great
mascara this is definitely a new phase
like instant phase okay so before I do
apply eyelashes I'm going to finish off
like the underneath of my eye and then
I'll be able to test that mascara for
like um bottom lashes too so I'm
actually going to go in with this color
which I haven't actually used yet on a
pencil brush run that along my lower
lash line something really soft 3 and
then I have absolutely no idea how I've
lived without this until this point this
is the NYX golden bronze slide on I
pencil first of all look at that color
and tell you that I doesn't scream my
name because it does and I just haven't
tried any of the slide on pencils before
what the hell where have I been under a
rock yes
I'm just going to apply that in my
waterline oh that's how that my doorbell
but that was me love it love it love it
yura yura yura now I'm going to apply
mascara say mascaras before on the
bottom lashes so let's see how that goes
I think it's the brush that I'm really
loving it doesn't like apply too much it
makes them look so like wispy I thought
you had like naturally really long
eyelashes that would make your lashes
look incredible definitely if you're in
the market for a new mascara check out
that one eye that's been my favorite
thing I've used this whole time any of
you I'm going to go in do it just on
here on this eye and then I'll be back
to apply lashes which I said I do you
guys are really gonna like okay so both
eyes have finished a very bronze e of
golden look obviously and these are the
lashes that I'm going to be applying to
my brand called lash pitcher there are
so links if that so mink collection and
I don't know what style these ones are
in oh wait kid flashes I'm going to
reduce what this brand is even called
okay they're in the style gala look at
them I thought they were really cool and
they're faux mink and they're from the
drugstore as long I don't even think
that they were very expensive so let's
see how they that's right okay so I just
kind of cut off the old extended black
parts that sometimes come on lashes in
case you've got a really big lid space
actually while that's drying let me do
the other one and then we will do lips
okay so I've applied a glue to both
those lashes so I thought violence like
drying I'll just apply lip liner so this
is from gosh and it is in the color 0:01
new girl so it's like a nude looks kind
of a creamy pencil oh very close to my
natural lip color so I kind of like to
color there because it's really close to
my natural lip line so if I'm over 90
actually looks like I've kind of had my
lips done
pigmentation isn't great but I really
like the color so that was the color new
girl 0:01
so the last one was slightly sicker than
I thought but it's been if being like
super flexible right now okay one is on
I like to squeeze them to kind of
together after they're dried and like
step down in place really love the
appearance of them like they're
brilliant fluttery there we kind of
actually natural-looking I feel like if
you just have like a little bit of black
winged eyeliner these look really really
pretty so while that's drying I'm going
to go ahead and apply a my lip product
server that I'm taking the anyway luxe
velvet lip lacquer I got this Christ or
Kylie's just come up with velvet lip
lacquers which yes I have ordered and
they're still not here yet so I thought
I would tried it and this is the color
harmony so I'll see and I can always do
a comparison if you guys
care for that was my ones do arrive okay
first things first
smells really young like fruity I think
the color of the lip liner goes really
nicely at this because it was quite like
a warm brown I mean that's really pretty
I do actually like the velvet finish and
I'm something really excited for my
Kylie ones to arrive so I can compare I
feel like this is the finished makeup
look everything looks really good I'm
actually really liking this foundation a
lot the skin products I'm really really
loving golden bronze pencil in my eye
