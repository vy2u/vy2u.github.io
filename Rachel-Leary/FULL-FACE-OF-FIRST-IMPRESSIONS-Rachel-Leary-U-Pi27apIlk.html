first impressions I've already done my
eyebrows just because I didn't have any
new products my eyebrows but I have
listed the products that I've used for
my brows down below and any other
products that I'm gonna use in this
tutorial that aren't necessarily new so
because I've got like a new liner and I
kind of want to go for like a winged
look today I'm gonna do my eyes first so
I'm gonna go ahead and prime them so
it's prime my eyes I'm gonna use this
primer from a cargo cosmetics they're
kind of HD collection comes in a little
squeeze a tube like this so I'm just
gonna put a bit on to my like the back
of my hand okay so just put a bit on the
back of my hand and it is a really nice
kind of like flesh toned color and I
love primers that are like have a color
to them and I'm just gonna apply this to
my eyes what a first impression it's
quite like silky so I'll wonder of it or
dry and definitely gonna have to set
this with a powder so nothing clings to
it but it is doing a really good job in
terms of like smoothing out my eye but
that my eye wasn't smooth before but
just like it's giving a really nice base
color isn't as pigmented as I thought
but that's not necessarily a bad thing
okay so that's my eyes primed so far so
good like I said I definitely like I
would with most primers I'm gonna set
this with powder but I'm gonna go ahead
and do one eye just because not many
percent sure what I want to do yet and
then I'll come back and show you how I
do it and do the other okay so a lot of
the things that I bought on received are
all kind of fairly warm neutral tones so
I've gone with something I know a lot of
you will like but look you'll probably
say is really similar to things I do but
I just kind of looked uncomfortable when
I'm going out after this so yeah so like
I said I've set the primer with powder I
just used my RCM a loose powder to do
that so it's got no color or anything
and now I didn't really have anything
that was looking new like transition
color so I'm gonna use one of the
bronzes that I plan to use this is from
colour-pop
I made a color pop order I'm so happy
that they ship to the UK now
shipping was a bit of a bitch in terms
of price but I've had such good things
about their stuff and this is in the
color
skinny-dip so I got this because it was
a bit more like an olivey turned bronzer
and they're the kind of bronzers that I
prefer so I'm just gonna buff that into
my socket as my initial transition color
you guys know I'm I really like to use
my bronzer as my transition color
because I think once the whole looks
complete it kind of the colors tie in
together and a first impression it
doesn't pick up a huge amount of product
that they're not massively pigmented but
I've had to really swell my brush around
in this bronzer to pick up the amount
that I've just picked up which isn't a
huge amount but I think that's kind of
good it kind of helps people not go too
heavy-handed and gives you a bit more of
a softer color so so far so good and as
for the primer obviously I'll come back
in like a few hours and we'll see how
that I makeup has worn to be able to
fully test it but it applied really
nicely and obviously after setting it
with powder me applying this transition
color on top as applied pretty nicely as
well and I really really like the color
of that bronzer so that was
skinny-dip bronzer from colour-pop
moving on to the next color this is
something that I picked up while I was
on a holiday this is an eyeshadow from
H&amp;amp;M in the color Canyon clay this color
literally screamed at me and I switched
it and it was so so so pigmented in the
shop and I actually didn't realize the
H&amp;amp;M did such an extensive range of
makeup so I did pick up a few of their
bits and this is just a really nice
matte warm color and we're just going to
use that to a further define our soccer
look how much pigment if you've got blue
eyes you need this color this is the
kind of color that just makes your eyes
pop because it's so like orangie Brown
and there's like no fallout and it's so
pigmented so I was really impressed does
anyone know what they might like own
their own but you know Topshop makeup is
owned by Estee Lauder which is why it's
quite it's really good quality so it
made under the same roof that's like Mac
and obviously like Estee Lauder and all
those other brands anyone know what H&amp;amp;M
makeup is made by we shall see and then
just going back in with our big fluffy
brush that the skinny dip on I haven't
picked up any additional
product I'm just using it to soften the
two colors together then for my lid
color I'm so so so excited this is one
of the main reasons I did the color pop
shoppers to get some of that eye shadows
and this one is in the color lovely I'll
do a little swatch for you so it's like
a really a nice champagne II pinky gold
color you guys know that these kind of
colors are right up my street so after
doing this I I originally thought that
these would apply best with your finger
which they do they're probably really
nicely with your finger but they also
apply it really nicely with a brush like
this this is a mac 242 brush so I'm just
gonna take my 242 brush and place that
onto my lid I think this would be a
really nice color if you did like a
spotlight eye to go in the middle so let
me know if you guys see that I should
have done that today oh gosh having all
the ideas when it's too late yeah these
super shocked shocked eye shadows I like
cream to powder formula so they are
meant to be really pigmented and creamy
but obviously they go on like powder
really really impressed with how that
goes on like I said I've had such good
things but kind of it was only a matter
of time before I made a purchase next
I'm gonna go in with this absolutely
gorgeous palette from pur Cosmetics is
the love your selfie 2 palette I think
well I've already set by now but me and
Han are going to the fest this weekend
with parkas Mattox especially kind of
showcasing this palette so this is a
little sneak preview it has such a
gorgeous range of eyeshadows and a
highlighter blush and bronzer a
brilliant gorgeous dusty rose liquid lip
and pencil and a little mini of my
absolutely favorite mascara which is the
perfect child from a scar you've not
tried this you definitely need to try it
but I'm just gonna go in with this color
here called headshot to highlight my
brow bone and inner corner okay wow
that's right oh my god these are choices
those I chose the so buttery that was a
matte one I'm now gonna go in with this
kind of here it is called at panorama
and it's more of a shimmery one I'm just
gonna use that to further define the
crease and just add a bit of depth I'm
obsessed with these shadows I'm so
impressed with everything that I'm using
so far let's hope it stands the test of
time I don't want anything too dramatic
so I'm gonna leave that there and then
I'm just gonna back away the excess
before we do our eyeliner okay so for
eyeliner I'm taking this wing it um
eyeliner felt-tip pen from a blank
canvas cosmetics I've used brushes from
blank canvas cosmetics before and I do
have a few here that I'm gonna show you
in a minute as well when I do my face
cuz they're more face brushes but look
at the wand on this it's so big and when
I was doing this one it just made it so
- so much easier so I know I'm already
impressing it so I would just show you
how it applies now because it has such a
long nib it makes it so much easier to
go from inner to outer corner and it's
so it's such a soft nib as well and it
sounds a bit dodgy but it's such a soft
nib so it makes everything so much
easier to apply and it just kind of like
a good lines across your eye and then
just doing the wing
okay I will say it's starting to lose
its kind of the point of the nib is
starting to get really like worn but
it's soft so it's not allowing me to be
super super sharp it's kind of like
bending so you can see my wing isn't
like super pointed so I'm just gonna go
back in with my wipe to tidy that up so
we'll see how that one will where's it
came to be a super long wear and a
waterproof eyeliner so like I said yeah
we'll see how that one wears throughout
the day but so far so good I mean the
nib was a bit disappointing it the more
I was kind of like using it the softer
it was getting so as I got to the tail
it wasn't rock hard anymore and then I
couldn't get a sharper wing as I wanted
but a wife did that for me enough that's
fine going back in to that perk
Cosmetics palette I'm going to take the
little mini of the pur fully-charged
mascara I didn't even realize that this
palette came with it so I opened it I
was so happy because Minnie's everyone
loves minis and especially if it's of
your fav product so these are kind of
the eyes complete you can obviously
leave it there in terms of mascara but
you know me and I love a good pair of
lashes but I haven't got any new new
lashes in at the moment so I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply them and then
we'll get on to the face makeup but like
I said any products that aren't new I
will have still listed them down below
so if you want to know what lashes they
are then you can be the description okay
so now we can move on to the face makeup
so for primer I'm gonna take the pur
cosmetics correcting primer and this is
the hydrate and balance formula so
perfect people with drier skin and kinda
just need help with balancing their skin
tone oh so it comes out like a gel
formula and then I am just gonna buff it
into my skin it has kind of like a wet
finish to the skin which is what I like
in a primer might to know it's feeling
hydrating bits actually kind of but it
feels really soft on my skin I can
definitely feel more of like
and adhesive 'ti I can't remember if
that's the word you know you can feel a
slight tack to it so you know anything
that you're gonna put on the top is
gonna hopefully last so we'll see how
this goes
so far so good though it feels super
super soft on my skin which is always
good with a palm you never when I feel
like it's rolling away like some of
those like silicone primers that you can
get and power cosmetics are vegan and
friendly as well I'm just reading the
back of this so for foundation I'm
taking quite like a different one for me
this one is from Carlos cosmetics again
and it is their oil-free foundation this
one is in the color
40 and and it comes in a little sachet
like this so the PR company that stocks
cargo and blank canvas cosmetics and
some of the other like brush and brands
so I'm gonna show you and Natalie she
picked the shade for me and she knows I
like to be quite turn you can see my
next quick tan at the moment on my face
is quite pale so hopefully this matches
well so I'm just going to squeeze a bit
on the back of my hand oh it looks
really like Lucy and then are you gonna
take this brush or from a bag canvas
cosmetics is the f20 and I love a good
stippling kabuki brush so I'm just gonna
dab it like this and then buff it into
my skin so as for color it's quite a
good match it might be the tiniest bit
too pale just for what I am at the
moment but a lot of you are probably
thinking no it matches as for the
coverage I would say it is medium to
build a bone it's definitely not fur but
it's definitely not sure but I'd say you
definitely able to build it up I've
heard good things about cargo cosmetics
I always used to UM really want their
eyeshadow palettes
I'd say the finish is quite a
conservative finish I'm not noticing any
instant shine but it's not really matte
either I don't know if it's the brush
that's absorbing a lot of the product by
I'm finding them having - you can see
look apply quite a lot so with this a
little doesn't necessarily go a long way
but you do get quite a large amount of
foundation in that packet okay so that
is the foundation applied and obviously
it's so far so good it's really
lightweight on the skin but I did manage
to kind of get like a medium covered
from there and the color like I said may
be the tiniest bit you like but I can
obviously warm up my complexion with
bronzer that's not a problem so we will
see how the primer and a foundation that
lasts together throughout the day under
concealer I'm gonna take the Too Faced
Born This Way concealer in the shade
light I'm so excited for this one I saw
it in Sephora when I was on holiday and
I was like yes
I'm not actually tried it yet I've been
holding out for this video so we shall
see I'm just gonna apply that underneath
my eyes my nose is kind of cleaning at
the moment so I'm kind of avoiding
putting too much product on my nose
because I don't want to draw attention
to it and so's my word so won't go to
hide that on then we'll take a bit on my
chin as well and then we're just gonna
buff that into the skin I really thought
this is gonna be a really a really a
full coverage but it's actually more I'd
say of a medium coverage and definitely
has a dewy finish to it I got mine on
see like a couple of shades lighter than
my natural skin tone because I want to
use it for highlighting so that is the
under eye concealer applied as you can
see it's really helped to brighten up
underneath my eyes and it's definitely
not too thick but it is giving me good
coverage so it sits and feels really
nice on the skin so we'll see how this
lasts in terms of creasing throughout
the day I am now going to go ahead and
set my face with powder I don't have a
new powder so I'm just gonna take my
trusty RCM a powder to apply that but I
am using a new brush this is my blank
canvas cause my different this is from a
blank canvas cosmetics it is their f15
tapered face brush and I'm just going to
take my pad and press it underneath my
eyes this brush is incredibly soft like
that feels like silk on my skin no jokes
and no bristles are falling out and it's
brand new so yeah thumbs up for that one
now I'm just gonna yeah take my leftover
powder and just dust that in place as I
just applied concealer so it's all set
by feeling sufficiently it's set in
place now oh what is next so on to
bronzer I am gonna go back in with that
color pop one in
but I've a feeling this isn't gonna be
as pigmented as I want it to be so we
might use another bronzer as well and
I'm going to take this big powder brush
from look good feel better which feels
oh my god so soft again this is from the
same PR company that has cargo and blank
canvas cosmetics I'm just gonna dust
that in there that's like not showing
out maybe I use a smaller brush let's
see if that makes it better
okay smaller brush slightly better it's
not really as pigmented as I want it to
be okay color pop eyeshadows yes
color pop bronzer not a massive fan in
terms of pigmentation I mean it's really
slightly wound up this is probably a
very very good bronzer for if you're
slightly fairer in skin on me it's not
really showing up massively so I'm gonna
go in with this bronze up from Cabo
cosmetics and it is in the color medium
and we're gonna go in with a bigger
powder brush again and see how this one
works out much better I'm just gonna
dust this everywhere to warm up our
complexion this brush is gonna be my new
favorite I think dusting things all over
my face it's got such like a big surface
area and it just blend the bristles are
so so so soft it just blends everything
nicely together
and that color bronzer was really nice
as well what was this again medium it's
not too orange it's really nice and
glowy and subtle I think alright dipping
in it to the selfie to Pat it again I'm
taking this blush color called
photogenic it is gorgeous it's like a
really really pale rose gold color like
looks like it's got loads of loads of
sparkle in it and I'm taking a blank
canvas cosmetics fo4 brush to apply I'm
not a massive blusher era so these
colors get me so excited look at that
glow oh my god if you're gonna get that
palette just get it for the blusher it's
going everywhere and this brush is
really nice and firm
so applied product of really well that's
been my favorite product so far that
blusher is gorgeous I feel like this
might be the icing on the cake this is a
new highlighter from Oprah it is a Rodeo
Drive I do have a discount code for you
guys starting off and think it's Rachel
Leary but I will have listened it down
below I'm just gonna take a Mac two to
four to apply that to the tops of my
cheekbones and probably dust it
everywhere I've seen everyone raving
about this so I have a feeling I'm gonna
love it actually first I'm gonna go in
with the cargo Cosmetics illuminating
stick in champagne there's like a bit of
a base I'm just gonna apply that with my
finger it is a cream highlighting stick
and sometimes I think powders apply
better if you have a base so cuz this is
new in as well why not we'll try it oh
my god on top of that blusher that looks
so pretty I'm glad I remembered this was
here
yes honeys okay now I'm going in with
Rodeo Drive on top of that Oh yep thank
you Tony
okay if you like a pigmented highlighter
I recommend that combination right there
obsessed I knew I was gonna love that
and I know you guys would too
I'm just gonna highlight my little nose
get it bulb in between my brows as well
and my Cupid's bow I'm gonna go ahead
and finish off the eyes by applying that
H&amp;amp;M eyeshadow underneath and then a bit
of that polkas mythix mascara again and
then we'll move on to some new lip
products so these are the finished eyes
with the eye shadow underneath
I had no fallout with that eye shadow as
you saw before when I was using in my
crease so super impressive and I'm
obsessed with this mascara on my lower
lashes as well the little mini of it
almost applies better than the big one
so I'm loving everything that was on my
eyes at the moment so we'll see how this
lasts throughout the day but now like I
said onto the lips so I don't have any
new lip liners but I did get some new
nudes so I'm just gonna apply oak lip
pencil from Mac to start with
I do get a lot of people asking me is my
as I've had my lips done and you can see
like look at what a lip liner does
especially if it's more like a flesh
toned brown color it make it makes your
lips look WAY fuller than they are
especially if you over line okay for
liquid lipstick I am taking colour-pop
ultra matte liquid lipstick in the shade
I have a feeling it might be a sold out
and I'm going to put this on and see off
the top of my head what dupes
spring to mind I've not tried them yet
but I've heard really really good things
okay so this kind of reminds me of lip
line Cosmetics 5050 Anastasia Beverly
Hills pure Hollywood type vibes but that
is one coat and I'm really really
impressed I wasn't really expecting much
less I've heard really good things about
them anyways but for one coat that dried
really really quickly as well but I love
a glossy lip and I got a gloss from H&amp;amp;M
this is the lush lip vinyl in milk and
honey and I'm just going to apply that
on the top okay
oh God really really pigmented and I
don't on that color to disappear so I'm
gonna be really Haring Lee with it
actually gonna dab that in with my
finger when i swatched it in the shot it
was really pigmented so I wasn't
expecting anything less but I didn't
expect it cleared that pigmented on my
lips you know I'm obsessed with this lip
combo hope yes and I'm just gonna
highlight my Cupid's bow a little bit
more just because it's me and it makes
my lips look fuller so that's what I'm
gonna look I think we are finished okay
so this is the kind of finished makeup
like I've painted like I said something
quite go-to for me just because I'm
going out after this so I don't want to
be anything too drastic the time is now
10:00 to 2:00 and I'm going out for
lunch and it's quite hot outside so I'll
be back in a few hours to kind of show
you how the makeup has lasted I suppose
and my final thoughts so
let's get a few hours okay so I'm back
now and the time is is cancer this is 19
so it's 7 o'clock as you can see i think
that i makeup wore really well it's not
transferred to my lid or anything like
that I did go out for lunch and stuff so
I was eating and because I put a lip
gloss on top of a liquid lipstick it
didn't last through the meal so I did
have to reapply it after the meal and
this is what's left so the gloss has
come off and it's just a tiny bit of the
liquid lipstick left but I'm not sure
it's because my powder but my
foundations lasted really really well as
well breaking away a tiny bit on my nose
but I think that's where I had
sunglasses and stuff so I'm actually
really impressed and giving my
highlighter a bit has made it um lost
throughout the day as well so all in all
and it's been pretty hot outside today
as well like I said I'm really impressed
with everything besides the liquid
lipstick just but I think that's my
fault because I put a gloss on the top
of the night 8 loads of stuff it all
gets a thumbs up from me so that's it
for this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed err make sure to give it a
thumbs up if you did and subscribe if
you haven't already if you want to see
more kind of like regular full face of
impressions videos let me know or any

one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
