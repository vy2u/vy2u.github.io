today we're gonna be testing a a bunch
of new in makeup so a full face of first
impressions I wanted to do is kind of
something a little bit different with a
bit of color underneath the eyes I was
inspired by watching a lot of Michael
Finch's most recent videos I think in my
opinion youtubers made me buy a video I
needed like a tail underneath his eye
and the palette by using this video had
a gorgeous teal color so I felt like
doing a little bit of color you know
also obsessing over this lip combination
oh my god I can't wait for you guys to
see what Ivy used to be like the look of
this makeup look then please make sure
to hit that thumbs up button if you are
new here then or welcome and I would
love it if you could hit that subscribe
button and make sure the notification
belt is turned on it so you never miss
are not glued if you want to see how I
got on with these products what I use to
create this look and all that good stuff
then please keep watching okay so I
think that I look I want to go for today
is a winged look so I always do my eyes
first and I'm doing that so the first
new product that I'm going to be using
is the Kathleen lights and color pop
collab it is the dream street I shadow
palette can we just talk about this
packaging first like I love everything
rose gold and then inside we have like
an array of like warm tones and then
there's like a teal and like a bluey
purpley kind of color perfect for this
time of year so I'm so excited to try
this now the lips I think I'm going
forwards kind of like the deep maroon II
nudie color so I'm gonna try and stick
with that theme but that turquoise color
is talking to me and I just watched
Michael Finch's video and he does like a
turquoise underneath his eye I feel like
I might do that you feel inspired by
that but I'm gonna do a winged look so
I've already gone ahead and done of my
eyebrows and primed my eyes don't worry
my brow routine is gonna be my next
video so stay tuned I'm gonna mix the
two top colors here as my initial
transition color but I will say about
these little color pop palettes is that
they're so hue and like perfect travel
sized like they're so mini and like the
pans are really mini to but I feel like
they're super affordable so the fact
that they're many I still think that
you're getting a good amount of product
for your money and those two colors that
mixed together are so nice they make
like the perfect transition shade I will
say there is like a lot of powder fall
out but it's not falling down on my face
so I feel like that's when you know that
you're gonna get a
good pigment because the product is
clinging to me I and not making me
crying and then gonna go in with this
kind of ready bury it color here to
further deepen up the crease now also it
take that one to the lid slightly as
well oh I think I think that color was a
bit more pigmented than the other two
maybe because it's more like the red
color and they wanted it to be a strong
Mac because sometimes it's quite hard to
get pigment from that shades but they've
done a good job on that one so - finally
a deepen up the crease I'm going to be
taking the dark purple shade from the
same palette just concentrating that on
the ultimate part of my eye and then
just these mats are really pretty like
they're not too pigmented that's like
overpowering there's like barely any
fallout that's just like only when
you're dipping your pan into the brush
but I think that just lets you know that
these are gonna be good and it's
actually a really cute like selection of
colors I thought you could do that day
looks with this palette take it to a
night look with this parlor love these
colors okay before we move on to a
shimmery shade on the pally
I'm actually gonna go in with a cream
eyeshadow first and I'm gonna take the
Revlon photo ready by art now there's
like a cream shadow on one end and then
almost a glitter liner on the other
which is absolutely stunning as like an
eye shadow topper like I was mentioning
earlier I got these knives in LA so I
don't know whether or not they are in
the UK yeah I haven't sort of been in to
double-check and look but this one is in
the color burnished
bling and I can't wait to see how this
looks like
so far I like the color it's a good deep
bronze if you guys don't already know I
am obsessed with cream eyeshadows I
think they're so quick and like
effortless if you need to do a quick
crease use holds an instant like shimmer
in your life but that's only if they're
like a good liquid eyeshadow because
this one right now I'm feeling if I open
up my eye it's gonna just transfer
instantly and the pigment is not that
like great maybe that's what the glitter
is for but we are gonna go in with one
of the color pop eyeshadows over the top
of this just to kind of set it in place
because this doesn't feel okay not
massively impressed with that liquid
eyeshadow side of that thing I'm just
gonna go ahead and take H this shimmery
shade here from the Kathleen and lights
palette and actually and mix it with
this one here just to set that cream
eyeshadow in place because I don't feel
like that's very set and I want a bit
more of a pop on the lid not they're
pretty they kind of match the color of
that it could I shadow well that's much
better sometimes I do just like a liquid
eyeshadow for a base anyway if they're
not that pigmented cuz I feel as you can
see like eyeshadows cling so much a nice
it's like a creamy liquid base I'm just
gonna take a fluffy brush again and go
in with that kind of brick color just to
reinforce that transition oh I love
these colors it's like a sunset oh my
god so obsessed okay so I don't have
like an inner corner highlight to shade
really actually I don't really have an
inner corner highlight of shade from
that palette so I'm gonna take a pale
shimmery gold from the highlighter that
I put up but the highlighting palette
that I plan to use which is the NYX a
born to glow highlighting palette and
I'm just gonna take this top shade here
so I'm just gonna go ahead and
we should have cleaned up my undereye
before I like this shade it's like a
nice white gold color so compliments
nice okay so that's kind of at the top i
shadow done so I'm just gonna go ahead
and wipe away with a wipe and clean up
and then we can go ahead and do the wing
but in terms of the eye shadows I'm
really impressed with that palette and
not so much that liquid eyeshadow up
from Revlon oh wait oh my god that
reminds me I'm gonna add a little bit of
the glitter because why the not so
I'm gonna do that now okay now this is
pretty yeah I love this color as well
accompany if I nearly forgot the glitter
like Who am I oh yes okay
now I'm going to go ahead and clean up
underneath my eyes and then we can get
ready to do the wing but as I said so
far so good with that palette I really
love the mattes and oh my god all the
colors and it just go together it's so
nice it's like a perfect little travel
palette for this time of year loved that
glitter from the Revlon thing not a
massive fan of that cream shadow and but
the glitter topper love okay so we've
just cleaned up our under eyes and now
they take the Gigi Hadid Maybelline
collection liquid liner pen I can't
remember if I've users in a vision orbit
is like the newest liquid eyeliner pen
that I've got so if you were thinking
about getting anything from the Gigi
Hadid and labelee in a collection love
that collection by the way there's so
many gorgeous products I'm just gonna
try out the liquid eyeliner this is like
black and I definitely don't feel like I
have to apply too much pressure if I
want to get like color pale and like the
nib is when there's an index like firm
but flexible guys not gonna lie
I don't remember mine uses before but I
that was really good like a lot of
liquid eyeliner pens are very like
flimsy or liquidy and they just smudge
and all sorts but this is a really nice
consistency of not too dry but getting
pigment from it without having to apply
too much pressure the nib was really
like firm but like I said flexible that
was so easy to do if you're in the
market for like a new liquid eyeliner
pen I definitely check this one out okay
now I know that that works I'm going to
go ahead and do it the other
and apply lashes and stuff off camera
because I ain't got no new lashes and
then we can move on to at the face so
these are the eyes computed with like
both liners done and lashes the lashes
I've used are just the House of lashes
iconic lights
I love these ones for like a winged eye
look I think they're super flattery and
natural they're not too too heavy so you
can still see everything that's going on
on the eyes which I am obsessed with
look how warm and bitter Ian oh this is
like me and an eye I mean I'm so excited
to start the face because I have so many
kind of new ish face products the
vitamin isn't like a hundred percent new
but it's like a new color so I'm
interested to see how it turns out this
is the Mac strobe cream in a gold light
eye oh my god wait on them I'm just
gonna use this to moisturize my face it
is actually in there like prep and prime
a bit of the map of Mac's website so a
lot of people if you have dry skin can
use this as a primer I think it has like
some priming qualities to it there is
more just like an illuminating
moisturizer I can't tell you how much
like the smell is so nostalgic to me I
was so excited when I ordered this
because I ran out of stroking when I
forgot how much I loved it if you have a
dry skin this honestly just looks
gorgeous underneath your makeup it just
makes everything that looks so glowy and
this one has like a brief flexible
yellowy gold underneath it I'm sure you
guys know I did actually used to work at
Mac and this used to be like one of our
best-selling products and also just like
it brings back so many memories of doing
people's makeup it just look you can see
it just gives such a gorgeous glow to
the skin I really like this golden
version looks super pretty okay so new
in primer I'm gonna take the iconic
London retexturizing face primer now I
have the iconic London advent calendar
and that's how I got this because it was
on one of the days oh okay this feels
like wrinkle okay it feels like silicone
II but like silky and slinky at the same
time all so soft and that
actually in combination with that strobe
cream feels in saying on my skin right
now yeah foundation I didn't actually
think this was available in the UK yet
but I found it on Space NK so it
actually is but what I got it I don't
think it was I'm not sure basically it
is from hourglass it is that veil fluid
makeup so I am obsessed as you guys know
with the hourglass stick foundation
honestly insane I'm a love it I love the
coverage like the way it looks in
pictures when I went to LA it we went me
and Gary went to the our past store and
met the woman that works there she
invited us down and she said that this
was just as good but it's just a fluid
version I've got the color honey which
is hopefully gonna match my tan I am a
fairly dark at the moment but when am I
not so I'm just gonna do a few pumps of
that and it take that my Beauty a
blender I feel like this foundation is I
said color wise is a little don't let
talk to kind of warm tone my tan my tan
is more of the olive tone right now but
in terms of the coverage it looks like
skin but is giving like a medium
coverage I feel like it's more something
that you build up okay so the color is
definitely not working with me right now
and the finish is hmm it's very like a
radiant and dewy but I suppose we can go
for that kind of a look I think I want a
little bit more coverage but I don't
want to layer it on because it's not my
color is that make sense I just don't
want to get any more orange moving on to
concealer I'm going to take the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow concealer now I
think this is only available in America
right now I don't know where it would be
available in the UK because I'm not yes
Sina so this should hopefully just get
you at UK babies excited for hopefully
what's to come the applicator of this
so like easy to apply but oh what my god
that's a very fluid concealer look I
definitely feel that this isn't gonna be
very full coverage which is a little
upsetting so I'm using this in the shade
creamy and natural which is number two
and you're gonna go in with my Beauty
Blender hopefully this will help
neutralize the foundation that I'm
wearing Hey okay the coverage isn't as
light as I thought it's actually I'd say
like quarter line medium but it
definitely is a very glowy so maybe
we're going for like a glowy skin today
why not were using strobe cream the
foundation turned out to be glowing we
using pro glow concealer let's make a
change okay so for a cream bronzer I'm
gonna take the new two-faced sweet peach
melting powder bronzer so apparently
this is kind of meant to go on like a
cream but have like a powdery finish I'm
just kind of taking a duo fiber brush
and hoping for the best oh I got I can't
tell you though how amazing this smells
the whole sweet peach collection smells
in saying I have a few items coming up
in the face category that we're gonna be
using okay I quite like the way this is
applying to the skin not sure how well
this would show up on someone with a
slightly obviously like a darker
complexion than me I'm liking the fact
that this is quite cool in tone I feel
like it works as a really nice how to
contour blends nicely too okay that's
all the kind of creams for now that
we're gonna be using so to set it all in
place I'm gonna again take another item
from the Too Faced sweet peach
collection and this is the kind of
translucent mattifying setting powder I
have already used this but it is a new
powder it has a slight pink undertone to
it but that's really great for like
helping brighten up underneath your eyes
and it doesn't really show up to tease
you pink on your skin anyways again
the smell of this is
literally insane I made a tweet the
other day saying that I ate it and I
wasn't mad about it because it's smells
and tastes so good conquer over the
smell of this whole collection it's
honestly to die for and it's like a the
sweet peach collection is more of the
matte finish on everything so if you
have oily skin I thought this is a good
collection for you to try it's gonna
sharpen up those battles
okay wow that's just like a baking and
setting I'm gonna go ahead and finish
off underneath my eyes okay is it to
finish off underneath my eyes I think
I'm gonna take the matte teal color and
then towards the inner corner apply the
shimmery tail color oh my god
oh my god sorry just really pigmented ah
thank goodness we baked hers holy hell
that teal color is pigmented and that
was just the matte shades before I
applied the shimmer I'm just gonna take
a little fluffy brush and buff out that
teal color just so it doesn't look so
harsh underneath my eyes and to just
soften it slightly then like I said I'm
just gonna take the teal shimmer and
apply that jazz on the inner lower lash
line so it kind of like fades into it oh
my god this color is stun so pretty okay
so just go ahead and apply the bottom
lash mascara and this is the finished
eyes I love the way that they came out I
wish I knew how pigmented that teal
eyeshadow would be because it kind of
like dropped down a little bit but I
love all these colors together I think
they look so pretty obviously you can do
whatever gonna look you want with that
palette it really offers like a range of
options for you so it sums up to
kathleenlights and color pop for that
collab because I'm living for this look
okay so moving back on to the skin I'm
gonna take the Anastasia Beverly Hills
blush kit in radiant I know this isn't
like totally new but is
for me I only just got my hands on it
recently when I went to LA and I'm just
gonna take the top peachy a color oh
that's some pavement oh okay
pigmented which is always a good thing
so yeah um super pigmented so you barely
need anything when you use that product
cuz I feel like this little kit that's
gonna last a while you guys know I'm
obsessed with a shimmery bronzer so I'm
just gonna take it the same at
highlighting palette I use only for my
eyes and I'm gonna use on my cheeks and
just gonna take the bronze a color at
the bottom here now this does look kind
of orangey so I'm going to kind of
dabble into the gold color too and
hopefully create ah I love that will
those two together ooh that's pretty
before we do highlight a skin you guys
know I love a good cream highlighter so
from the same at Too Faced collection
I'm gonna take the melting powder
highlighter so I'm just gonna try and
apply this the way that I would apply my
normal liquid illuminators which is just
with a little brush to apply it straight
on to my cheekbones oh that's really
pretty but this is giving me like glow
goals right now I love that and finally
as our powder highlighter for the
cheekbones
I'm gonna mix the gold and the white
shade together from the same Nicks born
to glow kit and just apply that directly
on the top
oh yeah sorry I swear every video I find
like a new pilot oh my god sorry but are
you seeing that but that looks like
butter on my skin right now I don't know
if it looks as good on camera as it does
in person but oh my god and finally
moving on to the lips I was gonna go for
a nude but I thought I would play more
on the kind of burgundy or colors going
on in the eye so I'm gonna take the
lovebug lippy a pencil from colour-pop
don't know if this is new but it's new
for me I don't think I've ever used this
one before love this burgundy color and
the lipstick I'm gonna be going with it
is the Too Faced peachy moisture matte
in the color got peach oh my god it's
like engraved with peaches on it how
cute I'm just gonna go ahead and try
this um these are so comfortable they're
cold they're moisture mattes and they
are a really nice rising oh my god I'm
suddenly like obsessed with this makeup
look so this is the finished makeup look
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
