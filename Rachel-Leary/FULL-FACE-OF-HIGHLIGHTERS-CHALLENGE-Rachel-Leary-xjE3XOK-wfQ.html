as you can see we've gone for a really
kind of minimal subtle matte look today
just kidding this is my take on the full
face of highlighters challenge so I
really hope you guys enjoy it I've left
the link to the original video it's down
below where it all came from so make
sure you go watch that one and give it a
thumbs up there's been as so many tapes
on this this is just mine and I'm just
having a bit of fun with it so yeah if
you want to know how to look like a
glazed doughnut then please keep
watching also fYI I am NOT naked I have
a bandeau on before I get any comments
down below yeah let's go ahead and get
started
okay so to start with we want to
obviously stop even from the skin so I'm
going to moisturize my skin using the
Mac strobe cream that I use this on a
day-to-day anyway it's my favorite
moisturizer before foundation and I'm
just going to Mac strobe cream smells
phenomenal as well it gives such a nice
subtle glow but that's not what we're
going for
next up we're gonna pry my skin and I'm
going in with L'Oreal Lumi magique
primer really really similar product to
Mac strobe cream but Mac strobe cream
hasn't actually got like primal
qualities to it it is more like a
moisturizer so this is gonna have some
adhesive and yeah what's that work and
he adhesive Atene to it to make things
cling to the skin a bit better now the
foundation as you can see by the way I
probably said earlier I'm not naked
I've got a bandeau top on but yes so my
neck and body is slightly more tanned in
my face so we're gonna have to darken me
up slightly so I'm gonna mix the Knicks
are born to glow liquid bronzer in a
pure gold with the nozzle ooh manator in
God for 1/3 blk are to make it a bit
more flesh toned I'm noting it already
they should do other challenges like AHA
face using only eye shadows or something
challenge I'll be sick I might do that
copyright wow this really is how to look
like a glazed donut aka delicious so
once you've applied your foundation I'm
gonna go in with powder and set that all
in place now I'm gonna use the Neve
cosmetics nude translucent powder this
technically isn't a highlighter but it
does have a glow like
so it's not technically a highlighter
but it's like one of those finishing
powders that has like an iridescent kind
of paralyze finish to it like you know
the ambient lighting powders from our
glass and stuff so I'm gonna mix in a
bit of the Inglot dazzle wait spot
cleaning it dust in the shade 0-3 for a
bit more color as it's going all over my
face and just buff that into my skin
obviously you want to make sure that it
lasts all day and like you want to stay
matte this is actually a really accurate
representation of what I look like after
the gym with that all set in case I'm
going to apply a bronzer and I'm going
to use Mac a gold deposit those people
have been using like betty lou manizer
by the balm so i wanted to use something
a bit different
but I think just a subtle bronze
obviously just lightly dusting the tops
of the forehead just that you know
subtle other like bronze glow
very discreet
now the highlighter I'm gonna take the
sleek solstice highlighting palette and
just kind of take my fan brush and
dabble in all of them and apply this to
like the highest points of my face so
might cheat the tops of my cheekbones
down my nose you know all those places
like don't be shy I mean this is quite a
subtle highlighter
like I said down the bridge of your nose
they just may be subtly on the end of
your nose you could fly oh I'm gonna
fill in my eyebrows now and I'm gonna
take the anastasia beverly hills at
below kitten Sun dipped and mix the two
colors bronze and tourmaline together
and just yeah fit in my eyebrows
just going for a subtle growl today
love it now for a bit of eyeshadow I
think I'm gonna take the same Anastasia
Beverly Hills palette and take the cup
color summer just on my finger and just
press that to my eyelid just pop that on
actually nice eyeshadow color then I'm
gonna take a pencil brush and they go
back into the sleep sauce this palette
and take the lighter shade and just
highlight my inner corner and underneath
my brows I'm gonna take this underneath
what I like here just a kind of like so
I think this is funny the only part that
I'm not going to use a highlighter for
I'm just gonna go ahead and apply it
mascara and then I'll be right back I
only applied it to my top lashes because
I just kind of wanted this to be a
really subtle I look and kind of more
like a skin focus but finally for my
lips I'm gonna be taking the laura
geller which glow baked as well
illuminated just like a really subtle
nude lip color and now you have it that
was my take on the full face of
highlighters challenge I really hope you
