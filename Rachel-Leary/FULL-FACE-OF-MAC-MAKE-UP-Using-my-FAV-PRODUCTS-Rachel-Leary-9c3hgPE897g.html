back to my channel my name is Rachel if
you are new there's been so many of you
guys recently joining us so hello make
sure to hit that subscribe button if you
haven't already and the notification
belt is on and thanks because we do a
notification belt that is so we do a
notification about shoutouts here and
today's or this week's notification a
bell shoutout goes to Megan Posey that
says you have such perfect skin also
love all your videos hashtag
notification squad love you so much
thank you so much Megan I love you too
and today's video is another full up
face video you guys seem to be loving
these at the moment I've been doing a
lot of kind of like drugstore branded
ones but today we're gonna be doing a
full face of Max so many of you guys
requested it I don't know this because
you just like love mac makeup like I do
or it's kind of one of those brands that
it's high-end but it's it's still
affordable at the same time like some
bits when I was younger it was always so
much fun to go into Mac and I felt like
such a bougie ass bitch picking up
something from Mac and I always just
couldn't wait to go home and wear it
also yesterday on my snapchat if you
don't follow me there and make sure you
do also on my Instagram stories too so
again if you're not following me on
insta come and join the fan I posted a
makeup look which I don't really do it
was an all matte eye but it was using
really warm tones to make my eyes kind
of pop and so many of you said that you
loved the look of that makeup and there
was obviously like a juicy nude lip
involved because I was going out but
like I said I haven't done an OL matte
eye in ages and so many of you were
asking to do an updated kind of making
blue eyes pop video which I've done
before but that was kind of using
shimmery tones I know some of you guys
love matte 10 so I thought why not
combine the two together because I
definitely have some Mac products I can
use to recreate that look so without
further ado I feel like we should just
go ahead and get started
okay so we're gonna be starting with our
skin at first none Mac offer like an
amazing range of skin care and like face
products I feel like everyone once in
their life has tried a Mac foundation it
was just the og brand that was known for
having amazing skin style so to prep my
skin I'm just gonna hydrate it using the
mac fix+ spray this is just the original
one you can use this literally at any
stage of your makeup before after during
it really just hydrates and refreshes it
was lucky enough to work with Matt and
did a Facebook live with them all about
this and the hacks you can do it with
this product honestly if I could
recommend just like one product that was
gonna work for everyone in this video it
100% be theirs plus the smell is
literally insane next up again is
another favorite product of mine this is
the Mac strobe cream this is in the
shade peach light again like their fix
plus they came out with some shade
ranges within this because again it was
one of their best-selling products it's
a really amazing and moisturizer that
gives the most gorgeous glow underneath
your makeup and I wanted to pick it up
in the peach shade because it added a
little bit more like a pinky bronzy
finish to the skin which I really really
love and like I said unlike a lot of the
skin care products this smells insane
I've been over going for quite a glowy
skin and look today so the next product
I'm going to be using is the Mac problem
prime and natural radiance primer in the
shade yellow they do two shades of this
there is a yellow shade and a pink shade
the yellowish shade is to kind of have a
more deeper all of your skin tones and
really helps to brighten up the skin and
the pink one is really great to help
reduce darkness as well but maybe on
slightly more paler skin tone either all
work says they're very similar in the
color it's just kind of based on like
your undertone maybe but I feel the
misconception of this is this is like a
radiance primer but this one actually
works really well on oily skin so if you
do have oily skin and you you get scared
to use anything that says the word
radiant and it or anything like this
this actually had oil controlling of
properties to it so it helps disperse
the oils on your skin and help control
them as well as priming your skin
hydrating your skin and giving a really
gorgeous glow so it also works on dry
skin to you because like I said
as those radiant properties to that I
promise you you guys isn't a sponsored
video and everything I'm saying is I've
already a hit I did used to work for
them so I feel like I want to educate
you guys like on some of their product
so you've never tried them I know they
have so many products so it can be quite
overwhelming sometimes so I thought I
would just kind of talk you through the
reasons like why I like these products
and why they work and kind of like food
for so I hope you guys appreciate that
if you do give this video a thumbs up
already so I know to kind of maybe do
that in the future with brands that I
work closely with and I'm like you know
educated on moving on it's a foundation
they do it so many different types of
foundation it's a rock but today I'm
going to be using the Mac Studio scope
foundation now this is like a gel based
medium to full coverage like buildable
foundation looks amazing in pictures it
does have an SPF of 15 which is always
it's super super handy like I said it's
more of a gel base rather than fluid so
it comes out a little bit thicker I find
this just looks so good in pictures it
lasts ages but it does have a slightly
more satin finish I know a cult of Mac
is the Mac Studio Fix fluid foundation
and everyone loves that one it's a go-to
especially if you're a pro a makeup
artist because it does gonna work for
everyone but I don't know I just I
really really love this one I love the
finish it's like a really comfortable
full coverage foundation because it's
more the satin gel finish so if you like
the look of full coverage maybe have
slightly more drier skin but hate the
feel of a super matte finish then if you
haven't tried this one definitely have a
look I just thought I would zoom you in
quick and show you the kind of finish
and coverage that you get from that so I
use the color end at C 40 which almost
actually looks a little bit light for me
right now but yeah I'm use the color and
C a 40 and I only use kind of one squirt
to squirt and they were kinda like
medium sized squirts and I didn't even
have to add anymore or anything like
that like I said really really amazing
coverage feels super super comfortable
on the skin and I really really love the
finish of it as well so yeah you you've
only ever heard of Mac Studio Fix
foundation and thinks that that's the
only one that they do that's full
coverage of rather than definitely take
a look at the studio scope cuz I love
moving on to it concealer now this is a
new one by Matt thought I was recently
introduced to that I've been testing and
trying and so far so good I really
really like
but the one I'm talking about is the
match Studio water weight concealer I
use this recently in an Instagram
tutorial it literally feels like velvet
it's like a drop kind of concealer and
I've been loving it dropped foundations
at the moment because they have such
phenomenal coverage and you barely need
any of it and it's a MCOs for this
concealer I'm going to use the color NC
25 so a good couple of shades lighter
then my foundation which is an n C forty
but this blends out like a dream like I
said feels like butter and velvet but
still provides the most amazing coverage
because sometimes that's full of
coverage or just like a general full
coverage concealer in general can feel
really thick and heavy underneath the
eyes and underneath the eyes it's like a
really delicate part you know you don't
wanna feel super super uncomfortable so
this provides the coverage and the
comfort as well which is what I've been
really loving it again I just thought I
would assume you in and show you what
that looks like once it's blended and
applied you can see it almost blended
into nothing but provides the most
amazing a coverage and it feels so
comfortable I thought I could barely got
anything on underneath my eyes or them
feel tight or sticky or heavy or
anything like that it's a really slept
on product I know it's new like I said
but if you're in the market for a new
concealer and you love doing this like
Instagram tips with all the dots and
stuff that this is a really good one to
try and I feel like less is more a
hundred percent and this is gonna last
me like forever so that's kind of it for
the cream products for now I'm now gonna
go ahead and set my face with powder I'm
gonna use the Mac Patrick star powder
this is honestly like a game-changing
powder it's one of those powders that
slightly Pinker in under tone underneath
so may not be for everyone because I
know not everyone likes a pink powder
but the color doesn't really translate
on the skin it honestly just photoshop's
your skin it makes it look incredible
obviously we follow Patrick Starr on
Instagram you know his skin is nothing
but flawless all of the time so the fact
that he came out with this amazing
powder is insane honestly one of my
favorite powders but I think it was
limited edition or it's really hard to
get hold of so I try not to use it too
too much but there are some amazing
translucent powders at the moment before
continuing on with the face I am just
gonna go ahead and do my brow so I'm
gonna do one off-camera and then come
back on and do the other one we just
take a moment I definitely nailed that
eyebrow and now it's time to attempt to
do the second one but today I'm going to
be using
the Mac brow fluid line in a deep dark
brunette towards the tail of my brow
just because it adds really really
amazing pigment and I find this like
brow gel line to be one of the creamiest
s-- that i've used in the sense that it
doesn't really dry out as quickly as
some others so i'm just using a small
angled brush yeah like i said that was
so creamy and so easy to apply with
those things though it's always best to
be super light handed with it and I
really really loved the color balance if
for me that was deep dark brunette but
to fill in the front of my brow I'm just
gonna take that little twisty brow
pencil this is in the color Brunner and
I love this because it's not waxy like
at all and it has a really soft color
payoff so it's actually quite hard to go
heavy handedly with this product yeah
just like a super quick brow with super
easy products I love a fluid line and I
love a pencil which is why I wanted to
get these and show you you guys that
these are amazing so let's move back on
it to the skin now the brows are
complete I'm gonna use one of my
favorite bronzers from Mac this is their
mineralized skinfinish and give me Sun
now I know like desi and Katy they rave
about this it is one of the best
formulas of bronzers I think they do
have like actual bronzing powders but
the deeper shades of their mineralized
skinfinish just blend onto the skin at
like a dream most of them have a really
gorgeous golden undertone i rave about
the shade of dark golden all of the time
this one's just a slightly warmer cuz I
think my foundations just look a little
bit too light so this gonna help kind of
warm up my complexion like I said they
blend it like a dream at the undertone
of them is so gorgeous and this one is
definitely one of their most popular
shades
come on SWA I'm gonna take the shade
sculpt by Mac ignore the packaging of
this this isn't like the Melissa sim
packaging this is a permanent product
you can buy in like a pan refill amazing
amazing if you are a pro makeup artist
to put into like a palette or something
it's just a really gorgeous cool turn at
sculpting a powder I just love this
because it's not too dark it's again
it's that cool turn to really mimics the
appearance of shadows I love the powder
formula of their powder products I think
that they just work amazing
combination with their other products as
well I wonder if you guys can guess this
next product it's like one of their
shimmering at bronzy a shade that I used
to be obsessed with if you guessed it is
Mac global glory all of my god I love
love love love love I love this
it's basically gives you the most or
just like JLo subtle glow doesn't really
add too much color but it does kind of
warm up your skin a little bit Mac do is
such an array of blushes as well but a
new formula that they came up with is
they're extra dimensions getting
finished blushes they basically just
have a amazing below and shimmer to them
and this color literally it called to me
if you're a little bit scared of blush
kind of colors like I am anything too
pink is a big fat nori this is such a
nice one it's a really gorgeous peachy
color I just love the glow that this one
gives to the skin as well and they
definitely do it loads of other colors
in this and finally next up is
highlighters now Mac I didn't always
used to have the best highlighters soft
and gentle and stuff like that and it
really wasn't great they've really
stepped up their game with highlighting
over the past year because it's become
at such a trend and I don't know if this
is out yet but this palette is
everything oh my god is so pigmented I'm
not even joking I'm gonna take this
middle shade here just on a brush I'm
just gonna apply it straight to the
brush first and then I'm gonna wet it
with fix+ a flirt on it add a bit more
glow but this is literally insane I
can't get enough it's called their
hyperreal glow palette bang but I'm just
gonna take that gold paler shade as well
just on brush I'm gonna spray it with
fix+ as well to really like intensify
the glory that's about to go down I'm
done
like I said I have no idea that's out
yet I feel like it's Knox I tried to
find it and I couldn't but it'll be
coming so so so soon you guys need it is
perfect for traveling as well or if
you're a freelance makeup artist and you
just need three different turns of
highlighter in one place this is in
sight
okay now we're gonna move on to the eyes
but I'm gonna go ahead and like I said
and just do one eye off camera just to
make sure I'm doing it the best way that
I can it's actually little bit quicker
for me because I can see my battery like
again is flashing because I didn't
charge okay so this is the eye look that
I did as you can see it literally it's
so warm Matt and it just makes blue eyes
really really stand out and so obsessed
it's so quick and easy to do as well
who knew using a matte shades be so
quick and easier to do so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you a way oh okay so
we're gonna be using obviously a Mac
eyeshadows today and you can customize
your own palettes at a Mac as well which
makes it super handy but I'm gonna be
taking the shade soft brown and it's
gonna be like a blown-out rounded shape
today which is why I was okay with doing
Maya's skin first but this look would
look so bomb was like a big black
eyeliner or anything like that I just
thought I would show you like a quick
and easy go-to I look that I've just
been loving at the moment cuz it really
makes blue eyes pop you know no I think
this is one of my favorite matte shades
as well this is the color texture I
remember when I first got introduced to
this because of my eye colors and almost
like you have to try this and I've never
looked back since it's one of my
favorite favorite favorite shades to use
just building up that crease color and
I'm gonna be taking this texture shade
underneath my eye as well this is
literally every blue-eyed person's
favorite color this is the color rule
from that this is just the most gorgeous
matte orange shade and we're gonna use
this to really intensify the warmth that
we've got going on and really add that
orange pop because the color we use on
the lid is gonna be like a super vivid
orange as you can see so the star of the
show today is Mac red brick now I'm
gonna be
taking this on a short shader brush this
is actually a Mac brush it's a two to
eight and sometimes with Mac colors it
can be quite hard to get them to stick
on the ice I'm gonna be it spraying at
my brush with a fix plus to kind of
intensify and make the color stay on my
eye and a fixed plus is normally
advertised or promoted to kind of make
pigments really intense and like foiled
eyeshadows really intense but it works
with matte eyeshadows too you can see it
just kind of helps to prevent fallout
even though we are getting like a little
bit but it helps to prevent fallout and
just kind of really solidified the color
on your lid that you want because
sometimes Mac colors can fade and they
don't really stick as well next color
I'm gonna take is Swiss chocolate of
really lovely or like warm Brown
rosy crease color I'm sticking with the
warm versions of color so this is just
like a very warm brown like dark brown
shade and the final crease color we're
gonna use is brown down again a Brede
warmer toned Brown I'm gonna be taking
it on like a brush like this this is a
sigma short shader e20 brush and what
I'm gonna do it's kind of really push
this into my upper lash line and create
a really smoky line effect and also just
gonna bring it up slightly into the
crease to just further deepen so you can
see just kind of creating that smoky
liner effect and then just taking it up
into the crease lightly thing to
highlight in the corner I'm gonna be
taking the shade nylon Han introduced me
to this thing I said there's a couple of
times I can't believe I've lived without
it I know it's an all matte eye but I do
love eight shimmering in a corner if you
prefer more of a matte in a corner some
of their colors are like blank type or
brulee or something like that but I just
love nine on just because it's more like
a warm toned shimmery gold and it just
really helps to open up the eye moving
on to eye line I'm gonna be a tight
lining my eye and putting some in my
waterline to really like intensify and
smoke out this look and I'm going to be
taking the costo reach I pencil a really
really nice warm Brown a really nice
alternative to black if you've got more
like a greeny blue eye vibe going on or
this if you've got red dark brown eyes
as well this is just a buck abri like
luxurious kind of color I cannot apply
eyeliner on a camera for but you
can see the kind of difference it makes
and we did it tight line as well which
then you do the liner on the top lash
line and they're just really matches
with the smoke shadow that we were going
for as well I just love this it's so
like effortless and easy now onto
mascara you guys know the MAC extended
play mascara is one of my favorites was
introduced to this by Jaclyn hill back
in the day she used to rave about this
mascara cuz she also worked at Mac and
it was one of our favorites on counter
as well the wand of this makes it so
easy to lengthen and separate lashes
even if you've got really really tiny
eyelashes like I do amazing four bottom
lashes for the same reasons it's just
like a go-to and finally we're just
gonna be adding a pair of eyelashes
these are the matte 48 eyelashes there
are synthetic lashes I love these
because they have a clear lash band and
they really mimic the appearance of like
eyelash extensions and I always say
that's the kind of style that I look for
when I do apply a false eyelash so I'm
just gonna put these on and I will show
you the finished eyes so these are the
finished eyes with the lashes as you
guys can see I feel like it really just
intensifies your eye color I love the
lashes and it's kind of not even messy I
look but it's obviously not clean-cut or
anything like that and these lashes just
kind of like hide it and just make it
look a bit more like smoky and sultry
which is why I've been loving doing at
the moment cuz it barely takes any time
into I know there was like a few shadows
involved but it's super super quick now
we can move on to the lips and Mac lip
products for some of my fave and I feel
like everyone's fav gonna be lining my
lips with the oak lip liner it's like
one of my favorite lip liners it goes
with any nude combination I'm gonna be
doing it new today because there is a
few products that I like I'm just like
obsessed with and I've been kind of
