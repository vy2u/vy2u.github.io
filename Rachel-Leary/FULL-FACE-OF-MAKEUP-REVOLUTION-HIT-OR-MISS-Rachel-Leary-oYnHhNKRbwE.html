like completely airbrushed literally oh
my god hey guys and welcome back to my
channel or if you are new here
welcome make sure to hit that subscribe
button and the notification bell because
we do a notification shoutouts here so
make sure that you never miss a video in
today's video we are going to be a
testing at makeup revolution you've
never heard of them before they are
super super affordable a brand available
from a super drug or drug so type thing
everything I think I've used one I've
listed down below and - it's like ten
thousand under which is literally insane
especially because well you'll see in
the video why I thought of it some of
the stuff is like dupes of really really
high-end stuff so if definitely and make
sure to save your money and shop the
products down below if you like them as
I'm applying them but this is the kind
of look that I did something I know
super easy soft glamour that is because
I'm going out after this but if you want
me to do a more testing videos I will
definitely make sure to do them a lot
more colorfully I just thought this is a
super easy glam look that everyone can
do and again is super super wearable and
it would be a way that I has stood
because this is how I like I like to do
my makeup all the time if you like the
look of this makeup look make sure to
hit that thumbs up button and if you
want to see how I got all over the
products and the products that I have
used people watching
okay so because I am going out after
this I kind of want to do a wearable
look but if I do another testing make up
one brand tutorial and definitely going
to use a lot more color and make sure I
have no plan afterwards so sorry if you
don't like soft clambering looks but
they are my fave and I feel they are
super super wearable I kind of wanted to
test it in a way that I knew I would use
it
okay so I don't think that makeup
revolution really did too too much skin
care so you can go ahead and prep your
skin how you want but the first product
I'm gonna be using which says new
actually I am going to doing my skin
first so I haven't already said I can't
remember if I said but I'm gonna be
taking the makeup revolution Pro base
aqua priming base so this is essentially
a primer spray which a lot of people
prefer because we lazy bitches when it
comes to our makeup so just then a dose
of my face into that smells actually
really really nice but then what I do
like to do when it does come to Primus
breeze is just kind of make sure it's
definitely pressed into the skin and
just kind of absorb any excess product
but so far so good it has left like a
little bit of attack I think that's when
you know that it's gonna be like an okay
primer because it's left a little
stickiness and that means anything that
you put on the top should hopefully
stick to it and lasts all day so we'll
see how we get on with that natural
foundation I didn't actually see that
they've really lighted a foundation and
the only one that I saw was the ultra
face face foundation which is a BB cream
and it claims to be ultra long-lasting
and I got it in the color FB onine which
was kind of the only kind of that I saw
so I'm not really sure what to say about
this one as of yet and like if the
colors even gonna match me so we shall
see it looks fairly golden and I have no
idea how much you're gonna need it this
I've just done like two squirts but I'm
just gonna go ahead and apply what I
will say though off the bat smells a
little like that play-doh we kind of
smell which I'm not a huge fan of but
I'm just gonna go ahead and just above
this into my skin it looked really
orange when I was when I put it on and I
was sunny about that Oh
and then I have to give that whole
should be looking where I'm like
obviously picked the wrong color but
when you blend it out the color kind of
changed to a lot lighter and a lot more
to my color so I just talked about with
that one like I said it's in the shade
like oh nine for a BB cream that it said
that it was actually quite a nice full
hover like medium coverage
it's got like a satiny do we finish yeah
a really nice coverage I'm gonna add the
tiniest bit more just like my cheek
areas that's why I like the most
coverage to be yeah it like goes on
really dog but then it blends out a lot
lighter actually looks really really
pretty on the skin okay so that's kind
of the foundation done like I said
really like the finish with that it's
kind of like dewy satiny really fresh
face and really really nice for maybe
like everyday kind of thing the only
thing I don't really like is the smoke I
know some has a little bit like a Jovi
but it's not too overwhelming that I'm
like thinking but next ups so excited to
try it is the makeup revolution conceal
and define I've seen this everywhere
recently everyone saying it's like the
new heart-shaped tape I got the colors
c7 and c2 c2 is definitely definitely
gonna like brighten up underneath my
eyes and I thought c7 was more kind of
to my color so it was gonna have that
rid of my like under-eye circles kind of
thing I'm just gonna zoom you in a bit
so you can see the skin a bit better but
this is what the wand looks like it
really really does or money at the tart
shape tape so yeah this is the color c7
I'm gonna kind of use this as like my
base concealer oh my god the coverage is
like insane and actually kind of a bit
lighter then oh I thought it was gonna
be so I might not even need the c2 but
we shall see I'm just gonna apply this
to all the places that I usually weren't
so like underneath my eyes you were just
like above my forehead a little bit mhm
oh my god I forgot my beads Bend up one
set its I'm just gonna go ahead and
blend this out oh shit I can see what
this hype is about got such a lush
coverage it's like full coverage but
literally not even that thick on your
skin compared to tart shaped eight how
shoot if you get like fun
nominal coverage but it does feel kind
of thick on the skin we see that I don't
I don't mind about because it looks
insane but this you definitely get a
similar effect okay I am loving this
base I am gonna apply a little bit of
the c2 just because I have it here and I
do like the appearance of a brighter
under eye but but that's the only place
that I'm gonna put it just underneath my
eyes oh my god yes I love this I think
that looks and has blended out so nicely
I'm so impressed okay moving on we are
gonna take the makeup revolution Pro HD
it concealer palette and this is in the
shade medium to dark and we're gonna use
this to a cream contour so I think I'm
gonna take a mixture like these two
shades together just using like a duo
fiber brush kind of mainly concentrating
on the slightly lighter color but so far
my brush is picked up like a lot of
product I'm just gonna apply this and
all the usual spots that I worked well
okay so I don't even really need to
apply any oil to this and sometimes with
cream contour products you need like a
little bit of oil to get them like
creamy but this you don't okay let's see
how it blends so he's gonna take like a
bigger your own fiber Brown and just
kind of like in upwards motions like an
almost applied to my jackets I didn't
realize it was gonna be so pigmented and
literally just blends into your skin
just kind of use my Beauty Blender as
well to help do you see that so easy to
blend it literally just looks like skin
like I am loving this so far okay so if
I was to use this again I definitely
keep in mind that a little goes a long
way like it's so pigmented but honestly
that's just like warmed up my skin like
so nicely oh my god really really like
this and plus it comes in other shades
and it comes with like concealer colors
too so I bet you they're super nice
maybe I'll use one of them to like
scoped out my brows and event
that's kind of all the creams that we're
going to use for now so I'm gonna take
the makeup revolution lace luxury a
baking powder now I chose this one over
the banana powder that they do just
because a lot of the powders that I've
been liking recently have a slightly
pink undertone for example the map
Patrick Starr powder a true face powder
like sweet peach mattifying powder that
one they all have a good society pink
undertone which is really really great
for helping to brighten underneath your
eyes so I'm just gonna take some of that
powder on a Beauty Blender and just like
it said use it cheer big words so I
always kind of like apply my powder with
a Beauty Blender but then just take like
a big brush when I want to sweep it off
and dust it away and then I just kind of
pressed the remaining powder from the
sponge into my forehead and you normally
like baked my forehead okay so now we've
like baked that for an alarm just gonna
brush it away oh wow so the purpose of
that powder is not to add any more
coverage but oh my god
I feel like that just looks like
completely airbrushed I feel completely
shook right now that I got completely
slaps on makeup revolution all these
insane products that are like dupes of
the products that I use all the time are
literally a fraction of the price okay
so to continue with the skin you guys
know I love a shimmery bronzer so I've
got the pearl lights loose highlighter
in the shade candy glow it just like a
really gorgeous deep bronze so I'm just
gonna tip a little bit on to a surface
and just use a really big fluffy brush
literally just how like I normally would
do to make sure I don't pick up and
dispense too much of the products so
just got like a big fluffy brush like
this oh okay I can see it's pretty damn
pigmented so I'm not gonna apply it like
to too much this is gonna act as our
like bronzer too I just prefer shimmery
bronzers such Oh gorgeous glowing
actually I like another pallet here but
I'm going to use to add some glow to my
skin it is the makeup revolution ultra
blush palette in golden sugar 2 and rose
gold so it looks like there
so I'm gonna dip my brush in this mat
kind of blush shade here for a blush
because I don't want to too much but it
just gives like a really gorgeous flush
to the skin and now I'm gonna dip my
fluffy brush into that bronzer shade
again this is just gonna add a bit more
of like a golden shimmer rather than the
red tone literally yes to the shimmer
now before I apply highlighter I like to
do my brows and I actually have a few
bucks to try it's the first thing I'm
going to go in with is the makeup
revolution at Bravo made with oh it
comes with a double-ended brush in the
color dark brown so it just looks like
your classic homemade I'm gonna use the
brush that they give you just to see if
that's any good - so I'm gonna zoom you
and Molly to a brow you guys know I kind
of like to use a dip brow for the end of
my brows so I'm just gonna go ahead and
do that okay so not gonna lie
brush is just a little bit too flimsy
for me so I'm just gonna go ahead and
take my usual brow brush to continue but
it's a really nice color - it's not too
warm actually pretty ashy and cool tone
which I really really like pigmentation
for me and a brow product like
especially in a perm aid I always do the
like tail test if you will because like
I don't really have a tail to my brow
what I do but it's just like so short so
I have to be able to like extend it and
it kind of just look like it's part of
my natural brow so then fill in like the
front of my brow I'm gonna be taking the
brow definer duo so it's a precision tip
brow pencil and it obviously it comes
with like a little spooley at the end
which is amazing for when you're just
like brushing the product through so
nothing applies to too heavy and again I
got this in the color medium brown so it
looks like it looks like this and we're
just gonna use this to fill in the front
of our brows I always like to use a
pencil at the front because you can be
super precise when it comes to mimicking
brow hairs but this is actually like so
creamy I probably could have done at my
whole broward this so that is like one
brow complete I think
maybe I'd get a slightly lighter color
for the pencil so it's just I've got a
bit more other gradient but that was
like so good it was so pigmented last
I think they should last I think they're
not gonna budge so I'm just gonna go
ahead and do it the other brow and then
we can we back to finish the skin eyes
and then lips so now both brows are done
I'm gonna go ahead and finish off the
skin by highlighting it and going to be
taking the revolution Sun kiss
highlighter in the color golden kiss and
I swatch this already literally oh my
god just gonna go ahead and take like a
precise little highlighting brush and
just start to highlight my skin oh my
god wow that's really really pretty this
is the finished skin and I'm honestly
like glowing okay so with skin complete
we can move on to the eyes so I'm gonna
be taking the Sophie does nails eye
makeup revolution palette which looks
like this honestly such a gorgeous array
of colors you could do so many looks
with this that involve color but like I
said I am going out after this and I
kind of want something a little bit more
wearable and a lot of time to take off
my makeup I'm gonna go ahead and take
this color here which is called a cup of
tea and just use that as my initial
transition color oh that's such a pretty
color and that's such a cool name too we
can take it in this one they blend
really nicely actually okay the next
color I'm gonna take is this one here
which i think is called floud berry and
it actually has a tiny weeny bit of
shimmer to it but it's just kind of a
nice orange color so I'm just gonna work
that into the crease to give it a bit of
warmth by actually really like the way
that's blending and I'm going love love
love these colors and for the lid color
I'm gonna take the color grow old which
is this gorgeous shimmery a bronzer
shade here and just apply that straight
to my lid it actually looks a lot more
bronzy in the palette but as it applies
it definitely has a more copper
undertone to it my eyes wow this is just
like such a soft glam
but I feel like with this palette you
could so you could do like day-to-night
looks add pops of color I am gonna
further deepen up the crease only a
little bit I'm gonna be taking this
shade here which is called tiramisu I've
just seen the shade underneath it is
called pug and oh my god that's like the
cutest name for an eyeshadow ever I'm
just using that to further deepen the
socket and I'm gonna take that cup of
tea color and mix it with the cloud
berry color and just run it along my
lower lash line to kind of connect
everything all together I feel doing
that really like brings out your eye
color and finally to hide up my inner
corner I'm gonna take the kind of
shimmery champagne color which is called
fairy lights and just apply that like I
said in my inner corner now makeup
revolution didn't do eyelashes but they
did a mascara and this is the amazing
curve mascara let's go ahead and oh okay
so the wand is like super big but
already curved so let's try this out as
someone that has little eyelashes this
is giving me a really nice color but
yeah if you don't wear falsies this is a
really nice natural looking mascara but
I'm gonna be buying a false eyelashes
obviously they're not to make revolution
but actually the house of lashes iconic
lights which I've been wearing a lot
recently for just but going about my day
to day job so I'm just gonna go ahead
and apply that and then we can move on
to a lit the finished eyes literally one
of my favorite looks I know I do this
look all the time - you thought been
wearing a lot of this look in a recent
videos like this kind of style of look
and those of you have asked for a
tutorial so I hope this kind of helps ya
I love the way that this looks on my
skin oh my good now we can move on to
the lips and it's obviously gonna be a
nude because that's the best way I can
test product so I'm gonna use the matte
lipstick in the shade it's posed okay so
there is definitely a lot Pinker then I
thought a non kind of scared for the
gloss but the formula of them is are
really really comfortable and they feel
that super super soft I'm just gonna
quickly highlight my he lives room and
now we can apply the glossy this is the
mind sign by revolution of gloss in the
shade Scorpio
which is not my style sign but it was
the nude version it was the nude gloss
ah okay a really painted gloss like
really comfortable I really like the
full minute these actually they they
literally just glided on but oh my god
slightly too pale so besides the
lipstick being a little bit too pale I
did really love the formula of it and
the gloss is actually a really really
nice for me again I probably would have
gone for a slightly less Pinker shade
had I been in store ants watching them
but overall I am so impressed like on
you guys I think it looks so so so nice
I can't believe I've slept on this brand
and not tried more stuff from them
especially because they are so so
affordable oh my god my favorites was
definitely if the concealer I really
really loves that blush powder but their
shimmers and I really loved
