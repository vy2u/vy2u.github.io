you are new here then welcome please
please join the family and hit that
subscribe button I'm a notification bow
let's say you stand a chance before a
notification bell shout out that happens
in the end of every video and plus it
means you'll never miss a video
algorithms are being fucked up on every
platform left right and center so if you
wanna stay interactive with me make sure
you notification bells are on all over
the show but anyway today we're doing
another full face hit and miss testing
video this is for Maybelline it was the
highest requested brand do you guys want
to try they offer such amazing products
a huge range of products as literally
something every category
besides eyelashes I promise you this is
not a sponsored video I just I'm
listening to you guys you guys wanted a
full face of Maybelline I'm gonna give
it to you I am a massive fan of
Maybelline at the brand already and a
lot of the products I just I love them I
can't fold them tried but from this
video you guys have find some new
products to or you like my
recommendations and it satisfies your
curiosity or whether or not it's worth
buying if you like the look of this
makeup look I just went for a classic
wing and a bright lip which you can tell
you switch up Maybelline obviously do a
huge amount of colourful and nude
lipstick options yeah you like the look
of this lip then make sure to hit that
thumbs are bun and keep on watching
okay so for today's look we're gonna be
doing our eyes first now the first
product I'm going to be using is the
Maybelline total temptation brow definer
now she would me picked this up or I
only had it in like a lighter shade so
I've just filled in the tails of my
eyebrows but something completely
different but you guys know I like the
kana ombre brow looks like though I
would just show you how it works just at
the front of my brow I love kind of brow
defining pencils like this I did used to
have the Maybelline micro brow pencil I
used all that up and I thought I still
had it and I don't so I definitely still
wanted to include something and this is
their new lucky said total temptation
brow definer oh I like this is not too
too waxy and it's not too pigmented in a
sense I mean I feel I can press kind of
hard and I'm not gonna give myself like
a really awful looking brow I like a
really strong colored brow this one is
in the color blonde is obviously gonna
be a bit lighter but eli's know like
they said I like having a lighter color
through the front and this little
spooley that comes with is so cute it's
like a little dome shape but I do really
really love the Maybelline a brow tattoo
if you've never tried that it's such a
cool like idea it's essentially just
kind of like a gel that you paste on to
your brows and it like stains them so
almost like a brow yeah literally a brow
tattoo but without actually getting your
brows tattooed and it's definitely not
permanent but the longer you leave it on
for the longer it will last on your skin
I'm really liking this out I felt like
that was done really quickly it's like a
foolproof pens like definitely feel like
I want to pick that up in my real color
the darker color to try out but I really
like that and it's not too like that it
looks really weird it was a really nice
buildable color okay so onto the eyes I
was kind of thinking of what look I
wanted to do and I knew I wanted to
involve a bold lip because Maybelline
have at such amazing bold lip option so
I wanted to do it something a super
classic serve I'm actually gonna be
taking a bronzers as eyeshadows today
and using one of their color tattoos I'm
gonna go for a really kind of classic I
look so I'm just gonna get taking the
master bronze face palette I'm just
going to be taking this
here in - at my crease as our initial
transition color you guys know I love to
use my bronzers as eyeshadows I think
they're the most perfect like warm tone
if you are looking for yeah just like
warm tones to put in your crease I'm not
gonna be using a huge amount of
eyeshadows today because I want the
focus to be mainly on the lips but
Maybelline do offer some amazing
eyeshadow palettes like their Burgundy
bar and then in the I think it's called
luck in the nudes palette or something
like that but because I wanted a
completely matte lip today I just
thought I would take my bronzes as that
kind of it's like one like one less
product that you need to buy and it - I
really love the undertones of them so
I'm just buff that into my crease and
then I'm just gonna go in with this warm
shade here on a like smaller fluffier
brush and just place that on the
outermost part of my eye and just build
it up and blend it and I love this
bronze shade especially on my lower your
eyes I think it just makes it pop and we
don't want anything too dramatic because
like I said we want the main focus to be
on the lips and I'm going for quite a
classic look so I'm going to take the
Maybelline Color tattoo in creme de nude
I love this this is like one of my
favorite Maybelline products just
because it's such a dupe for the Mac
painterly paint-pot if you've never
tried that it's a really nice eye base
it's just flesh colored gives a gorgeous
and matte finish so I'm just gonna be
taking some of this on a little up flat
kind of concealer brush if you like
doing those half cut crease it looks
this is a really a great product to do
so just because it's really long wearing
its matte and it's a really good just
kind of nude concealer finish color
color finish that's what I meant they do
so many colors if these kind of tattoos
as well so if you're always someone that
needs to do that makeup quite quickly
and just need something on their lid
they do really gorgeous like shimmery
options but I love their like matte ones
there's this woman just crammed nude and
I think this one called a creme de Rose
which again I feel as a dupe for the
painterly paint-pot from that did I say
that about this one I can't remember but
basically they're just really good dupes
for the map Paint Pots
as you can see I'm just kind of taking
it like 3/4 of the way
oh just like that and I know they are
Matt but I do just want to set it in a
place with powder quickly now I won't
speak about this just yet because I'm
gonna be using it on my face as well so
I'll wait till we get to there for that
but I'm just gonna press it on the top
so it's not really gonna alter the color
at all just gonna make sure that it's
all kind of looked and set in place I'm
just gonna quickly go back in with my
fluffy brush that we used in the crease
before just to create that really
gorgeous smooth transition oh my god I
love this it's such a like easy look but
it looks like you put so much kind of
like time and effort into it but just
like so now when I know like a bold lip
is gonna be involved I always just kind
of want to go for minimal ishow and a
winged eyeliner I just think it's such a
classic look it doesn't draw any
attention away and it just yeah is that
kind of signature classic retro kind of
vibe so for eyeliner I'm gonna take the
Gigi Hadid and Maybelline collab liquid
eyeliner just because the nib on this is
so big yet precise and defined and the
color payoff is insane so it's gonna
make it super easy for me to be able to
create a really the kind of like big
winged liner I always find and recommend
like these eyeliner pens for people that
maybe struggle with eyeliner or aren't
confident in them just because they make
it so easy so I just like to kind of
create it across the top and I think we
want to go like big today or like bigger
than usual so I'm just gonna create that
line
I'm just dragged back and I think
Maybelline actually do a really gorgeous
gel liner I personally never tried it I
should have got it for this video that
would have been cool but me and gel eye
line is it's like a love-hate
relationship like I like them sometimes
but I just find pens and liquid
eyeliners so much easier that was just
like so easy to do so once you join I'm
just gonna take a wipe and just clean up
like the eye shadow underneath and just
make sure that that eyeliner is an
attached and razor sharp like Maybelline
don't have false eyelashes but they have
one of the most incredible ranges of
mascara in the drugstore so today I'm
going to be taking their newest one
which is the total temptation mascara I
already love the brush of this it's not
your classic kind of like firm combed
brush which I'd normally go for but this
is kind of like my second favorite brush
type
it's the firm feathered brush which
really rich really helps to lengthen and
define I'm sure like everyone has tried
at least one Maybelline mascara in their
life it's like what they're famous for
let me know in the comments down below
what your favorite maybelline mascara is
this one is sigh amazed if you've not
tried this yet you definite a just gives
the most gorgeous like length and
separation and nothing it too clumpy I
hate like a comfy mascara or how you
think like that
but these are the finished eyes done I
think that's super like easy and
effortless and especially cuz we're
gonna be going in with a couple if you
don't want anything too too dramatic on
the eyes that she obsessed with
everything that I used like I said those
color tattoos are like my fave
especially they're like flesh and nude
colors ones but I'm just gonna quickly
pop some lashes on but then we can move
on it to the skin and the lips which I'm
so excited for again because you guys
know Maybelline foundations are like my
thing so these are just the eyes with
the lashes on a super classic really
easy effortless I look perfect for any
bold lip option so let's go ahead and do
the skin and get to that okay so to kick
things off I'm gonna take the Maybelline
and Gigi Hadid strobing cream in gold
and just kind of place this on the
highest
of my face that I kind of want to go I'm
not gonna apply it all over my face
because I don't want to be like a giant
disco ball so I'm just kind of giving
these parts of my face a little bit of
pre-primed glow but I love the color of
this it's such a gorgeous bronzy color
it would look so gorgeous
on holiday like all over your body is
like a strobing liquid so that is what
it's for it's more like a moisturizer
type vibe such a gorgeous glow
I love the color of this I'm not sure if
it's the same one as Stella coverage you
know strobing liquid I think that one's
a bit more like a bronzy and golden
which I so prefer now onto the skin I've
never tried this primer before this it's
the new maybelline superstay primer I
knew I wanted to use the maybelline
superstay foundation because guys is
like the most incredible coverage and
long wearing foundation but you guys
know I love the fit me man poreless one
as well so I wanted to mix up because I
haven't used this one in forever like
though I would use the corresponding a
primer and especially because I've never
even used it before I can let you guys
know my thoughts on it it says to shake
well so I'm just giving it a good shimmy
and I'm just gonna whoa give it a few
pumps and just rub it into my skin what
I will say is this definitely reminds me
of the wire sell all hours primer like
the consistency and stuff I'm just gonna
kind of avoid the highlighted areas by
the way cuz I don't want to like take
product away but that YSL all ours
primer is amazing and it does make your
makeup glass like all ours - the fact
that this claims to oversee be a super
stay primer and it reminds me of that
one already I have like high hopes for
it really like just glides into the skin
I feel like my skin looks totally
different after applying that it looks
just so smooth hydrated and glowy now we
can move on to foundation and this is
the maybelline superstay 24 hours full
coverage foundation so obviously I was
gonna love this it's full coverage is
meant to last I'm just gonna do a couple
of pumps this is in the color 46 warm
honey I'm just gonna blend up into my
skin with a
II Beautyblender I know you guys always
comment on my Australian accent when I
do that I actually can't say it without
one
it just sounds better you know yeah I
like I forget how amazing this
foundation is the coverage like I've
barely applied like any I just did one
pump and one pump air and it just covers
my whole face with like the most amazing
coverage if you're in the market for a
new drugstore foundation definitely
maybe check this one out I just thought
I'd do a little close-up of the coverage
and the finish I think it's so nice so
nice okay moving on to concealer it was
really hard to pick one because again
Maybelline offer so many amazing
consumers but I thought I would go with
Maybelline fit me concealer in the color
twentieths and I always loved and loved
to tell you guys about if I feel a
drugstore brand does high-end dupes and
this one for me is a super super similar
to the Naz creamy radiant concealer I
think it blends up a lot easier but
still offers the same incredible
coverage there's so many incredible
drugstore concealers right now I'm
loving it
so nicely and I don't find that this
cakes too much because it's one of those
products that's like full coverage but
also lightweight at the same time if I
could change one thing though I'd
probably wish it was a little bit more
like a matte finish because it is kind
of like satiny and that's not like my
favorite thing when it comes to a
concealer underneath the eyes I mean
it's not so much a problem because I
always go ahead and like apply powder
anyways so maybe they should bring out
like a fit me matte and poreless
concealer that would be cool speaking of
powder I'm gonna try a new one today
this is the Maybelline new matte maker
mattifying powder is why these powders
that's like perfect for your bag this is
the color natural beige so I think I got
this with the intention of kind of
setting my face with it I did get
another one in classic ivory I cannot
get the lid off like I actually can't I
think this like jammed it like twists a
tiny bit but so I'm just gonna go ahead
and use this powder now for the rest of
my face and just kind of take the excess
underneath my eye just to make sure it
is still set but I'm not really gonna
get
any brightening qualities from this
because the other color the other color
doesn't work but this part of matches to
my that foundation really well that was
a lucky lucky guess by me so this
foundation was in warm honey and this
powder is in natural beige so I think
that they were really nicely together
and I've done a really good job at
mattifying my skin without applying too
much color or feeling super pinky so I
think these are new actually the new
matte make a book we'll see how this
last because we'll see how this last cuz
sometimes I find with these powders
they're like so good to carry around
with you but then that's why they're
kind of good because you always do Chi
need to touch up but so far so good love
the color that was really scared it's
gonna be super orange and I was
literally gonna get like abused in this
whole video oh my god I'm such a fucking
donut I wanted to use this which is the
master cream contour I mean it feels
okay I'm gonna I'm just gonna go in and
use anyway I probably would have done
this first not the powder but I'm gonna
go ahead and use the contour side of
this this is their massive contour in
the color medium love that it's a little
pencil don't love so much that there's
like a highlight to side on the other
side just because sometimes the colors
the colors merge and I get like a little
bit of like white on there I'm just
gonna run this out not sure how good
it's gonna be in this sense I just
powdered my again but actually that
looks fine thank God for that I thought
it was gonna be this like creamy
powdered contoured mess I love the color
of it and it blends out almost into
nothing and I love the fact that it's
like a cool tone contour color cuz
they're making go back and with like a
warm bronzer this just really helps to
look realistic in terms of shadows okay
to further kind of just bronze up the
skin I'm gonna do anything it's too too
heavy I'm just gonna take this middle
shade here from the same palette that we
used earlier for our eyes they tap a
little bit off because I just kind of
want like a gentle kind of bronze to the
skin such a gorgeous glow yeah like I
said I don't want to do anything too
heavy and this palette kind of offers a
contour bronzer shades and a highlighter
shade for blusher I'm gonna be taking it
their master blush palette
taking this gorgeous pink shade hair I
don't want anything too heavy so this
kind of office like a huge range of
colors depending on what vibe you're
going for but I kind of want this to be
like a bronzed look so I'm just gonna
apply this to the apples of my cheeks
just for like a subtle flush to the skin
I'm loving the way the skin that's okay
so for highlighter you guys know I'm
gonna take the Maybelline master chrome
molten gold highlighted this has slowly
becomes one of my favorite products of
all at time it's the most buttery
formula I'll show you literally so
pigmented straight off the bat I don't
feel like I need to use like a cream
underneath like I would normally do and
when I first got my hands on this when I
went to the launch of it I felt so bad
about using it in videos because it
wasn't available yet but it is now so if
you haven't picked it up definitely try
it so comparable to like gilded honey or
a BH so Hollywood Mac oh darling that
kind of vibe and I feel like the payoff
with this is a lot stronger it's a lot
buttery and creamier and just blends
amazingly like I've used this before and
you guys know it's insane I just think
that looks amazing I'm gonna zoom you in
and show you the skin because right now
I'm just taken back so this the skin up
close I definitely wanted more like a
subtle flawless skin vibe type feel and
I feel like I've achieved that I love
the way that the skin looks but now we
can move it back on to underneath the
eyes I'm literally just gonna dip a
pencil brush back into this middle shade
here just to kind of tie everything
together I'm not gonna smoke it out too
far I don't want the attention to really
be there just kind of want to connect it
all together and then going back in with
my total temptation mascara just to
apply to the bottom lashes so these are
the finished eyes and skin I knew I was
gonna love everything because maybe he
is one of my favorite brands and I'm so
glad you guys requested this because I
love sharing with you guys some of my
favorite products and we can all use so
for the lip option I thought with a
classic look like this why not go in
with a red these are the new maybelline
superstay matte inks and they are
literally incredible they do it some
amazing colors there's like bright
oranges loads especially with that new
total temptation range I think they came
out with a bunch of new nude colors
which obviously you're I'm I thought I'd
go through red too because I haven't
done a red lip in a while and I actually
wore a red lip out last night and this
is a very similar look to what I wore so
I'm kind of getting two birds with one
stone of you guys or wanting to know
that makeup look that I wore from what
you saw my snapchat stuffs yet this one
is in the color 20 Pioneer has like a
really easy applicator brush I will say
these feel a little bit like thicker
then a regular liquid lipstick but the
applicator of that makes it so easy to
apply and it just kind of like glides on
and the sponginess of the formula I
literally can't describe it in any other
way it's an almost more like a lacquer
but like a matte lacquer it does feel
like a little bit sticky but I always
find these tend to be the ones that
don't flake off and give you that like
ring in the middle if they're a little
bit sticky so I'm kind of okay with that
but nonetheless I think this is a
brilliant classic gorgeous look and I
really love the way that it all came out
so yeah this is the finished makeup look
so this is the finished look guys I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
got to see a bunch of Maybelline
products being put to the test but you
may have been tempted to try or seen
people use and didn't know whether or
not it was worth the hype I love the way
that it all came out I promise you this
video isn't sponsored I just so many of
