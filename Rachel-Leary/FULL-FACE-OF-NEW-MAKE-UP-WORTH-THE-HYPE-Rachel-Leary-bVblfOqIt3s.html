makeup which I was dying to try of seen
so I'm even talking about it and it just
looks right on my street right up your

of glam purpley spring leap so if you're

those things so go into the sun's up
make sure you're subscribed I make sure
that Bell is on and now you can continue
watching the video okay
so to begin we are gonna kind of prep
our skin and I'm going to be taking at
the 24 karat gold chocolate dream oil
from velvet 59 now I don't know if this
is like new as in like a new product but
it's new to me because I've only
recently been put on there PR which she
has sent this to me and I am so excited
oh my god honestly this just smells like
chocolate and like I feel like you could
use this in like a kinky sexual scenario
and also be getting like really soft
skin at the same time you know I mean
you can see the gold of flakes in there
as well I'm just gonna do a light
drizzle across either cheap and just
massage that into the skin I feel okay
with using an oil on my skin today
because we're gonna be going in with a
is super matte foundation so I feel like
the combination of this and then I'll
obviously apply a primer and then going
in with the matte foundation I feel like
it's gonna give me a really nice satin
finish because I have quite dry skin but
honestly guys this smells in saying I've
linked it down below I feel like you
just need to buy it just to smell it and
just rub all over your body okay moving
on it to foundation I'm gonna be using
the new la girl Pro matte foundation
this is in the color light tan and it
says it's a HD long wear and matte
foundation now I don't expect this to be
super matte off the bat for me as I've
got quite a like hydrated and
moisturized
base but I've used this once before and
I like you can see that's like full
coverage I'm just gonna use this brush
to kind of just apply the base color
layer if that makes sense just apply the
product
everywhere I feel like a little goes a
long way with this
so just applying that all over the brush
and now I'm just gonna go in actually
with the LA girl sponge that they sent
across with this and just really press
it into my skin just to make sure it's
not just sitting there and just really
work that in I'm loving the coverage of
that I'm loving the color of that it's a
really nice kind of so like I said that
was the color light tan I'm not already
tell how matte it is just because of the
base that I chose to go for but feel if
you have maybe oily skin you like a good
full coverage but nothing that's too
heavy and feels too sticky definitely
check that out they're selling it on a
beauty bit at the moment and I've linked
it down below
moving on to concealer I got this a
while ago I've not used on camera and
barely kind of used it all so it's still
quite a new product for me is the ex1
and delete fluid concealer and this is
in the shade at number 5 this really I'm
just going to pop them on a little
palette just one pump um this really
reminds me of the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer same sort of concept and I
feel like it's the same sort of
thickness as well but this is a lot more
yellow base their whole collection of
foundations and also concealers they're
all very yellow but I think that's
because their brand is meant for people
with kind of more all of your skin tones
that have that more yellow under base
that's just to their target audience ah
but this is like some flesh so I
just applied that with a brush I thought
that would be the best way to apply it
I'm just gonna take my same a sponge and
really like press and work that into the
skin it has quadri it has a really nice
natural satin finish like it doesn't
feel like it's drying out my under eyes
at all
I don't lend it out really nicely as
well because sometimes with these thick
concealers they can fairly thick and
heavy underneath the eye and I put
almost like feel that it's gonna start
shaking and stuff like that but no that
was really nice it blended out almost
into like nothing you know yeah and it
doesn't feel too heavy the color wasn't
too bright or too intense so yeah really
like now I'm gonna go ahead and set my
face with powder and then we can
continue on with the rest of the face
now that it's all nicely is set in place
for kind of a lot of the skin products
I'm gonna be taking the new Hoonah
beauty 3d highlighter palette and this
is the new bronze edition so it looks
like this it has a cream kind of bronzer
highlighter shimmery bronze a shimmery
kind of blusher and then it's regular
highlighter as well so the two that I'm
gonna be using today is just the cream
highlighter and the bronzer shade
because I've got a blusher and I've got
a different highlighter that I really
want to use so I thought I would give
these two a go so first of all I'm gonna
be taking the cream highlight in
Barbados and just kind of apply that Oh
JLo like around the perimeters of my
face where I normally like to apply a
bit more like a shimmery bronzer
I wasn't sure kind of what color this
was gonna be on me because it's almost -
it's too dark to just be a cream
highlighter but it's not really dark
enough just to be a cream bronzer but
whatever the color is I'm loving it it's
like the most gorgeous like sunkissed
gold like I would put this all over my
body I'm just kind of applying it and
it's actually really working I did set
my face of the powder and this is
working really well with it it's not
kind of separating or anything like that
it's really blending
into the skin and giving me a really
gorgeous glass and I want to put some
my shoulder Oh baby bear I love that
color if you're on holiday that would
look incredible like I said all over
your body so take me a big fluffy brush
I'm gonna be taking the shade out of
home up which is like a shimmery bronzer
shade here and this is gonna act as my
bronzer it almost looks like quite a
cool tone shimmery bronzer which I've
never really seen before do you think
it's coming across quite cool tone as
well it's almost like a shimmery contour
which I'm vibing with I love anything
that's gonna make my skin look glowy and
bronzy so I think that just looks
natural you know right moving on to a
blusher this literally arrived today it
is the a benefit Gold Rush blusher and
this is just like let me show you inside
like it has the most gorgeous shimmery
tin on the top of it now this kind of
reminds me of their California blusher
and that had a gold tint on top of it as
well which to me just kind of acted a
bit as a top coat so I feel like if this
one is anything like that the shimmer
kind of comes off instantly but then
you're left with the color underneath so
if I just take my blusher brush yeah as
I thought the gold has kind of come off
instantly but then it reveals this color
underneath which is described as a warm
up golden nectar blush I feel like this
is gonna look pretty nice on like paler
skins as well so the color this is
actually really subtle and you guys know
me I hate anything too dramatic when it
comes to blusher just a little flush on
the cheeks is all I want and that really
it gives it so don't just expect that to
almost be like a highlighter as well as
in if you thought that gold shimmer was
gonna be running the whole way through
because it doesn't but the color
underneath is a really gorgeous pale
coral pinky moon tone color and it just
gives the perfect flash to my cheeks I'm
moving on to highlighter this is one
from NARS this is the new nas powder
highlighter in Fort de France it's your
classic like
champagne e gold now with the silencer
when I first was watching them the
pigment wasn't that great and I was
thinking that our like I had really high
expectations to be something super super
pigmented but then I really thought
about NARS products and that's kind of
not what they're you know they're vibe
is there a lot they're really into their
natural beauty and just enhancing
everything that you already have and
everything feeling quite comfortable on
the skin so I actually have tried this
already but it's still really new and I
just wanted to show you the way that
they were so off the bat hmm it's a like
I've had like you see that's watch I've
got more pigmented highlighters but when
it goes onto your skin and the way you
apply it for example I'm gonna take my
normal highlighting brush sister
anastasi Beverly Hills one and just kind
of buff it in like wow like this almost
gives I don't know how to describe it
it's like an intense strobe like it's so
natural looking onto the skin like it's
literally blended into my skin like
there's nothing sat there you can't see
the highlight you can't see where it you
know where it separates and I think that
just looks insane like it looks so
natural but blinding like this brush
with it as well works amazingly but it's
just such a soft like strobed effect and
I literally love the way that looks on
the skin I'm now gonna go ahead and do a
one aisle car but it's definitely going
to be on the pinky a purpley side
because the lip we're going for is pinky
purple and this is the palette that
we're using so I'm so excited to have a
little play around and we'll be back to
show you how what who where and why
here's on my okay so I'm gonna go ahead
and use the Lime Crime &amp;amp; Venus XL
palette if you haven't seen this yet
literally like oh it is gorgeous if you
have green eyes you need to go ahead and
put this in your basket and buy it right
now because this is gonna be your
palette so if you begin
I'm gonna take the color idolize which
is like a warm brown and just take on a
fluffy brush and it blend into the skin
now notice I didn't actually set my lids
this time and that's because I've been
watching loads of the like Pro anyways
on Instagram for example like if you've
heard of P Louise and mamamaman on and
then the Mitchell I love him and they
never set their eyeshadow base I thought
the pigment shop a lot better when you
don't and on a seer
things just blend a lot easier I have
been saying for a while that I want to
do like a pro anyway inspired makeup
look in the sense that I want to
recreate their complete look and include
their techniques as well because I just
love the way that looks and I just want
to try it on myself you know like
without maybe them having to like do it
or maybe I should ask one of them to do
it and see if they would for a video oh
my god either way just let me know in
the comments section down below because
we're going to go for like a puppy theme
today I'm gonna I'm gonna go in with the
shade triumph which is just this
gorgeous matte plum shade just on a
smaller my fluffier brush and just blend
that in I want this to kind of show up a
bit so I'm taking it quite far on it to
my lid these aren't really pigmented and
really really nice to work with like I
said because they're all of like a
slightly more purple undertone if you
have green eyes I bet you this looks in
saying that this whole palette on you
would just go and then I'm just gonna
take the color of gold on a slightly
smaller fluffier brush again just to
further deepen up the crease but I don't
want the eyes to be too dramatic as
we're going for a slightly bolder lip
today to time with the eye so I don't
want any focus be taken away from that
I'm just gonna blend blend
it's all about the blood about the blend
yeah and and those shadows are really
really easy to blend but before we go in
with our next product I'm just gonna
kind of carve out my crease using that
ex1 concealer again and just a flat
concealer brush just so we've got a
little bit of a tacky a base to work
with us we are gonna be using a pigment
just how about the crease like so and
the pick am I gonna be using today is
from a color pop it is then new pigment
in the shade weakened not sure if you
can see but it's like a really gorgeous
kind of pearly iridescent pinky gold
kind of color it has reflex of like pink
running through it which i think is
gonna really tie it in with the lip and
the eyes as well only good it's just a
really nice kind of dusting of shimmer
it's not too intense which I really like
just like so and then taking it this
shade here from the palette it's called
goddess this really looks like the lip
color we're gonna be using so I'm just
gonna use that to diffuse the crease and
pigment shades together
see it just kind of creates a really
soft transition across the eye I love
you I love you I love you I'm just gonna
take a pencil brush and that initial
idolise shade that we use and just tie
it all together like I said if you have
green eyes you should def o use maybe
more the poplar color underneath your
eyes that's gonna really make them stand
out and pop that's all you can really
show I mean that the highlighter now
like it just looks like skin but before
we apply lashes I'm gonna go ahead and
use a new mascara this is from a buxom
this is that big tease plumping mascara
now my lashes are still kind of
recovering from wearing lash extensions
so this may not be the best demo of this
mascara but for what I have left I will
show you so the one goes from thin to
thick so I think it's meant to get
really like elongated lashes like cat
eye lashes which I really love like
that's what I look for in a false lash
so if my real lashes can look like that
I am down let's try on the bottom
so that's what my lashes look like with
the mascara on but like I said anyways
we're gonna be applying falsies and
today we are gonna be wearing the
Primark sultry lashes oh they're one
pound one pound they look like that
they've got that kind of flared edge to
them a super thin lash band so I'm
hoping they're gonna be really easy to
apply for one pound I'm hoping that
these look good I mean normally I go for
like the faux mink or like mink looking
lashes so I never really go for the
synthetic ones so I'm excited to try and
see what they look like so I'll be back
to show you the lashes and then we can
finish with the lips so these are the
finished eyes with the Primark lashes on
oh my god I normally just don't wear
synthetic lashes just because if I do I
normally kind of customize them myself
and I mean you definitely could
customize these but these just allow me
to see like everything that's going on
on my eye like everything all the colors
and all the blending and they just took
so natural feel like this is a really
nice everyday lash as well and they
exactly as I thought they were so easy
to apply with the super thin lash band
and if you're confident wearing them
without liner as well which I know a lot
of people aren't because you can't
always get them as close but because
they're so thin it works really well so
I really like those but now we can move
on to the lips so for the lips today I'm
gonna be a taking it the unmelted matte
liquid lipstick from Too Faced in the
color melted clover now this is a
inspired collection by Gerard's dog
clover you don't know John is he is the
owner of Too Faced and has the most
adorable little puppy coat over and I
say collection because it comes with
this melted matte liquid lips and also a
really cute makeup bag that has the like
anime print all over it and what makes
this collection so special is that they
are donating huge sums of money and
profit from this collection to three of
their favorite kind of animal animal
charities or whatever they are called
rescue services that kind of thing just
three very close animal charities close
to their heart which i think is amazing
so the color itself looks incredible so
I can't wait to try it on but even if
you just kind of like these dusty moe
the kind of colors or even just for the
cute packaging or makeup bag it's worth
picking up because you know it's going
to an amazing a cause and plus the
formula of these are born anyway so
let's applies clover that's a really
pretty purple
I love this color how gorgeous is that
purple and it really ties in with like
the pinks and purples going on on the
eye but I am gonna go ahead and use a
gloss because I haven't used this yet
and I want to include as many products
as I can they're gonna be new for you
guys so I'm gonna go in with the Mac and
you cope and gloss in a panda kiss which
like every it's sparkly pink so I think
it's gonna really tie in with the lip
and the eyes and just finish off this
look
oh this look girl wants feelin it's a
night guys pretty much the makeup
complete I'm gonna go ahead and use the
new wire cell hydrating makeup setting
spray to lock this bitch oh I love that
that smells really like good and it was
definitely more of like a Miss you know
something again it's a proper like and I
feel like it's gonna make drop marks
with my face that was a really nice miss
I liked that and I really like this
smell as well there's nothing worse than
a sketchy-ass smelling scent and spray
but this is the finished look so this is
the finished makeup that guys I really
