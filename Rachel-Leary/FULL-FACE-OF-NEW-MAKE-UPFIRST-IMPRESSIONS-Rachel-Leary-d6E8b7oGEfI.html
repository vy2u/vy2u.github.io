I've accumulated a lot of new and make
up recently and I thought what better
way to try or than in a video for you
guys it ranges from recent collections
that you probably have seen on Instagram
some may not even be out yet that I have
received so I'm super excited to try or
this I just created like a soft glam
look like you're going to appreciate a
soft Graham look but I'm using some new
products from Tuesday's Oprah makeup
geek a new set of lashes that I've never
tried before so definitely make sure to
give this video a thumbs up and you're
all about trying new at things and new
and makeup or if you want to see it more
videos like this from me in the future
and definitely make sure to hit that
subscribe button if you like the look of
this video and this look in general but
yes without further adieu
if you want to see how i got this makeup
look and what products i used to achieve
it then please keep watching hello hello
what do we have here I've got so many
new products in front of me
I am so excited so I think we should
probably just go ahead and get started
so I'm going to be going ahead and doing
my skin fast cuz normally if I was doing
like my offer's it be because I was
doing a wing I'm not either wing
yesterday for the first time at the ages
and I've just completely gone off of
them on my eyes like I used to be the
bronze smokey eye winged like Queen and
now I just don't think it suits mention
I mean so I'm going to do it like a
rounded I am going to be applying a
little bit of liner because I've got new
lashes and I'll slightly of a wing so
I'm going to like line the top by
joining to do them first so two skin I'm
going to be taking these fasoli Rose God
elixir now I have seen this all over
Instagram it's how everyone starts their
like Instagram videos by going like oh
something like that should not I mean so
this is meant to be a really good
underneath your amita and I'm just
applying two little drop
then I'm just going to bust that in with
this brush it's my multi-task brush
racing from Real Techniques now the one
thing or the one thing I will say is one
the gold flakes don't settle on your
skin so you're not like trying to blend
them in but this smells like oranges
like it has a really strong citrus smell
which I really really like and it has
left my skin feeling really it's not
smooth you guys know I've been well I do
love wearing like a facial oil
underneath makeup and the foundation on
Wednesday is particularly like heavy so
I hope this will kind of help to break
it down and make it like easier to apply
on the skin so far that feels really
nice I don't think I overly did it
because you don't really applying too
much oil cuz then literally nothing is
going to sit on your skin okay it's
something that I was so excited to
receive try and much test in the
toothpaste three and one replenishing a
primer and setting spray so I'm going to
use this at the end of my makeup as well
but I'll see it the primer spray and I
love primer spray they just took a quick
easy way to prime your face and if
you're lazy this will be really good I
thought this is already out in America
but for us UK peeps I don't think it out
yet so I'll let you know how it goes oh
my god I just love that like coconut
smell if you have the two-phase hangover
ex-prime there you know the kind of
smell I'm talking about but the spray on
that's probably like so I'm definitely
feel like I'm getting a lot of product
out of there now normally I would like
use my brush to just like that in a bit
more but because I just used it with
that oil product I don't want to add
more oil on top so I'm just going to
like and fan myself you know so it kind
of dries I don't it'd be two drives my
breast of the foundation I'm using is
preset okay so the foundation I'm using
isn't like that new but I don't think
I've used it on camera and it's inside
my drawer or something I've been wanting
to try and test and it is the rodeo
airbrush makeup and it's a heavy duty of
foundation
paste so it is like sick so I am going
to go
and just use the end of my tweezer and
just holy hell
like just paint it on like so
holy hell this is pretty damn thick so
the only tool that I'm going to be using
is a damp Beauty Blender to apply this
oh gosh this isn't a shade number three
unfortunately I feel like they only did
about four shades and the number four
shade wasn't even that dark which is a
bit of a letdown because CEF slightly
darker skin and you want this full
coverage and you wanted to try it I
don't feel like it was dark enough from
what I remember but in my part with more
shade since like I said this was like a
little while ago but I just haven't
tried it I get quite a lot of makeup and
I buy quite a lot of makeup so sometimes
things just kind of slip through that
you want to try but I know a lot of you
people watching I like me and you love a
full coverage so I wanted to try this
out and like see how it goes but don't
the colors pretty good I might be that
this was called like that airbrush
foundation or something
I do feel like the coverage does make me
look pretty damn airbrushed I went by
but I'm so glad I used like kind of like
oil based products underneath this I
feel like that's helping a lot to blend
this out okay now we have applied our
foundation I am using to consider say
because I can't decide which one and
they both came out recently I have the
airbrush concealer and the abrupting
concealer from its benefit now these are
like these are like a newer version of
their like old boring one one of them is
slightly more pink base and one of them
is slightly more of the like creamier
base and this is the airbrush and this
was the brightening one so I think I
want to put the airbrush one on first
and then the brightening one I know
believe me you might want that pink on
top but uh I was watching Kim
Kardashian's snapchat the other day and
she's been using a lot of pink products
recently and apparently they're really
great underneath the eye anyway even if
you don't have like dark circles so I'm
going in with the airbrush concealer
both of these are in the shade number
two I'm just
apply this underneath my this kind of
reminds me of a slightly more creamier
version than that nos one that came out
that long ago the soft matte concealer
just going to apply that underneath the
eye there and then again if might be to
blend it to blend a I'm using a lot of
like airbrush products on either
completely unintentionally that's the
new trend at the moment airbrush
foundation airbrush concealer everyone
just wants to look plastic fantastic
okay so in terms of coverage I actually
quite liked that I felt like I felt like
it was going to be a lot but actually
using the sponge blend it in really
nicely but for me I just want it to be a
little bit brighter and I've seen good
on a testament of the range you guys I'm
going to take these brightening
concealer again this is in the shade
number two the slightly Pinker based one
just pop that on top but just mainly on
like the fine lines like your bag area
the bagging area the one thing I will
say though is benefit packaging is
always like the best oh it's so you and
speaking of which I'm actually going to
wireless on firing booth benefit so if
any of you guys going to Wireless
Festival on Friday and you see me hunt
you said make sure to say hi because
I'll probably be a little bit tipsy and
I'll obviously want to see all you guys
and get pics I still don't know what to
wear those so can you guys just let me
know you're wearing and then probably
able to decide but I think that's
actually really nicely brightened up
underneath my eye without me you know
without too much product so I'm now
going to set everything in place so I
don't have any new kind of like creamy
contouring products so another new
product I'm going to be using is the Too
Faced Born This Way a cereal ethereal
setting powder I've been dying to try
this because you guys know me and Laura
have a really strong bond
I've never cheat on how I always go back
to her she's like my number one I feel
like there needs to be a new session
without if someone's got to knock off
the top so I really want to try this and
see how good it is I
I'm going to slightly bake with it so
let's go ahead and do that
okay I get it I'm going to tell you now
I don't know this because I was using
quite like heavy-duty products but as
soon as I just put that powder on I
literally felt everything going oh
like not like time I actually yeah that
is probably the way I describe it just
feels like time but I feel that's how I
know it's like definitely been certain
place and if you guys didn't know I like
baked underneath my eyes and then to set
the rest of my face I use kind of like
busing motions I feel that gives an
airbrushed finish and you know there's
like flat contour brushes that you can
get like the rounded one they are
amazing to like buff powder into the
skin weird slightly but baking
underneath my eye like setting my lid in
place but I will say I am deaf I gonna
spray at my face words fix+ right now
because I feel very set like I can't
move but I definitely feel set in place
but powders are one of those things that
you kind of have to test with time but I
do feel sufficiently set it was as soon
as I thought if there's a lot more I'm
holding in the word when I put it on top
of those particular products it did feel
very like setting everything in place
but kind of tightening I don't really
get that with Laura but I know some
people do so we'll see how it was but
this isn't new but I am just going to
spray myself with six-plus because I
don't like a really heavily powdered
finish and I feel like that's something
I've accidentally just done I'm going to
your click I have a best Andra six plus
is one of those like incredible products
that just solve all my issues for me and
a dry skin 6 plus feeling a bit hot 6
plus need to get over your boyfriend
okay I'm now really loving the way my
skin looks after you doing that so thank
you Matt but now I'm going to go ahead
and do my eyebrows and for that I'm
going to use the NYX tame and frame like
brow pomade now I did be a campaign for
the NYX brow products but I actually
only use the micro brow pencil a Mesa
taming frame
and then the other day we received the
big PR package that had all the brow
products in it and I realized never
actually used it before and I feel like
this is a ketubah alternative for like
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow and
stuff all of them not me how to opener
that's what you did isn't it okay I can
open this one so I'm taking the shades
blonde and brunette and I'm going to
take Runet colors towards the end of my
brow and then the blonde shade towards
the affluent to create that like natural
gradient I will say this does steal
instantly as I put on my brush a lot
more like moosie than the dip brow but
then I for the difference of
ages and these are like a brand new I
literally just open them so let's go
ahead and try it so so far I'm really
liking this color that all in like a
very cool tone which I can appreciate
it's always the end of my brow that's
like the test for me phone literally
like drawn so far I really like that
that went on like super easily
it wasn't like too heavy duty as well
and yeah I think that the really nice
color smell to color brunette that I'm
using like towards the end of my brow
now I'm going to take the shade blonde
on a slightly smaller angled brush and
do it the front I just like to trace the
base trace Lizzie I'm going to run it
through and then I like to flip it like
I turn the brush around just go follow
where the brow hairs are going a lot I'm
happy with like the shape I'm going to
use the NYX tempted at brow mascara and
blonde as well never try to be before
and you guys know I do prefer but you
like to brow gel just going to hold it
all in place and use it to kind of
feather up the front and a little bit
more like dimension to the brow I'm not
really like I'm going to go ahead and do
this eyebrow now because now I know that
they work I'm going to go ahead and do
that and then we can move it back onto
the face okay so like I said it moving
back onto the face a new bronzer that I
got recently was from
makeup geek this is in the color tawny
and this is what they described as their
medium skin bronzer so I'm just going to
go ahead and apply this unlike a small
keep brush I will say off the bat it
does look very warm toned which I'm
happy about
well you are I think that's a nice color
that's not too warm and they're not too
pigmented either I was scared I was
going to like brush that onto my skin it
was going to be like clinging to
everything oh just like that a little
bit
oh god I'm going to do that thing and
you get myself like a bronzer helmet at
quick dad dad
there's nothing you to dental clinics no
I really like that
okay makeup geek I see you okay you guys
know I've read a little of a shimmery
bronzer and this one is from Rimmel not
sure it's new but I recently had a
meeting Ramat and they gifted it to me
and it is corded there their radiance
bricks I'm just going to take like a big
fluffy brush and swirl my brush around
and just pick up no product maybe it's
just this one's in the color medium oh
no I am doing what what what I am
getting a little bit of a glow I think I
just always compare everything to my fav
global glow from mark but you know this
is nice really so I feel like if you a
larger skin than me this would work just
as well even though it's in the shade
medium on it to abhilasha and then
highlighter both of these are from Oprah
and both of these are from their new
like their tropical island collection -
this is that blusher it is in the color
fellini it is be like a lighter pink one
because I'm going for quite like a light
pink soft glam look I've decided because
the eyeshadows and everything so I'm
just kind of private to my cheeks
ivory didn't need much of that asshole
and it's definitely a lot darker on my
skin then it appears so I'll be back -
they do you want it to look - like to
light is that makes sense so I'm glad
that it kind of translates slightly
darker onto the skin and as
for a highlighter this is the Oprah
highlighter in a Bali
I love over highlighters and this one is
off like a rose gold so I'm so excited
to try this because I'm really into that
kind of J Lo's bronze gold kind of look
and like a rose gold and really nice
alternative color instead of like your
champagne gold like your iridescent
white highlighter oh my god it's
freaking love there oh my god actually
you saved me in it Oh everywhere I think
that's so pretty it's not too rose gold
it almost comes out quite like a yellowy
gold I can tell that's going to be my
go-to on holiday when I talk more like
color to me thank you anyway I'm pretty
sure that is like the skin done now I
will under see it spray all the same
spray at the end but now we can move on
to eyes I already know I'm going for a
soft round it doesn't going to take
leave you and makeup geek in the nude
splash of the planet I literally think
this is so gorgeous another two screens
prom don't you think these are such prom
colors so I don't even think I really
want to be wearing that much actually
but I do want to test as much as
possible for you guys but I'm going to
take the middle shade and this outside
stretchy start with and these are some
of the new matte color so it's some kind
of bust and crease so just these two
here that background or I don't you guys
prefer it when I do these kind of softer
glam looks to like effortless ones that
kind of look put together that really
weren't anything at all and these
slightly more maybe it tone but makeup
geek eyeshadows I feel like they've gone
under the radar like I'm glad they're
bringing out some new stuff this and if
they hadn't in ages and their eye
products I feel like a war made them
like to take off in the first place
because they were so affordable and it's
so pigmented yes they're just taking
those to new crease colors into the
cream like so and now I am going to take
this kind of here this one isn't a new
one but they have added into the palette
it is the in the spotlight for our
shadow
which is one of my favorite foiled
eyeshadows from them anyway
it's such a gorgeous like peachy pinky
color I think if you had green eyes this
look particularly stunning and then
finally just think it is well I'm
finally just going to take one other
crease color and it is this one down
here this one is called it dark roasts
I've never actually heard of that one
before I feel like that's one of the new
matte shades I'm just going to use that
to lightly deepen the crease I don't
know apply it to month like I said this
is more of a softer Brown looks like we
are going for and just pop that back in
that's actually all that I want to do
this is such a gorgeous everyday palette
I'm just going to take a pencil brush
and take the cryst color that we use in
the crease and just run that along my
lower lash line and connect it around
I'm just going to take a pencil brush
and tape I'm just going to take this
color here which is called Rapunzel and
if use that to highlight my inner corner
why is this one not as pigmented as the
others in the mirror but that's just
like normal come out maybe it's the
brush line anyway I'm actually going to
take the over highlighter because I
decide that color I want that to be more
of my inner corner color I'm now going
to go ahead and apply a new mascara and
this is the amount that Jacobson mascara
in the velvet noir major volume I've had
such incredible things like this I can't
wait to try it but I'm also going to be
trying out these new lashes from Italy
lashes these are in the makeup by Samuel
style I've never tried it before but I
loved his mentor he also has a YouTube
channel if you guys haven't seen it he
is like behind all the like genogram
sometimes and all that good stuff so I
feel like he must use his own lash on
them but I'm just going to give them a
little bit of a trim and then apply some
glue but these are like winged out and
super fluttery and I feel some and these
actually bandless I was going to apply a
liquid eyeliner but if I look I don't
need to now because these are sanded and
maybe I'll feel a bit done something
with liner in the future
but now I
go ahead and apply it mascara I love
this packaging it's like a box again or
a hexagon and just coat my lashes with
them whoo for me I need a little brush
like a bit like grit but it definitely
is super like black which I'm loving
that's what my lab coat looks like with
just mascara but bear in mind to be fair
my natural lashes are very very short
but yeah as I said if you have like
naturally long lashes anyway so like
this would look so nice but now I'm
going to go ahead and apply these
eyelashes where am i pleasers yeah oh
yeah oh my god I love you they've got so
much like the layering to them they look
like you've just kind of had lash
extensions I mean they're still like
drying and sticking down but oh my god I
love them I didn't have a new lip liner
so I just applied a nude one really
quickly but I am going to be using the
adjust restart liquid lipstick in butt
naked now this was sent to me by a
beauty day I didn't purchase it myself
slightly controversial I know because
some people don't support him or
anything I'm not necessarily his biggest
fan but I know some of you guys do enjoy
his cosmetics so anything is fair
because this is actually one of the only
like new lip products that I've received
recently that I've purchased I didn't
punch this one but I've got so I wanted
to try out for you guys and just show
you the colors show you the formula
because even though you may not think
he's like a nice person you may just
like his cosmetics so I am NOT going to
apply this and it is more like the
peachy color I thought it would tie in
with the makeup I will say I do really
like that color and the way that they
apply so while that's drying I am just
gonna take a little bit of that over
highlighter and apply it to my Cupid's
violin but now after the exciting part
I've been dying to try these and so many
of you guys have been asking me about
them I am going to go ahead and apply
two of the shooter Beauty lips trips one
in the shade angelic and one in ritzy I
am going to put some angelic on sizes
it's a slightly a darker one these
honestly glide on and make your lips
look
so juicy yeah and then I do like to take
a little bit of the lighter one which is
ritzy and just apply that kind of more
ugh in the middle I said in the middle
and then I just lit she applied it
everywhere oh my god they are so
comfortable
I can't they're like a barn like
strobing barns I love them so I'm now
just going to go ahead and spray at my
face with the setting spray and that is
the lip complete so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video
I literally it always happens I usually
love everything at that I use I mean a
foundation for every day maybe slightly
too thick it literally is a paste but if
you have full coverage rather like me
then that is something that I will learn
to deal with I really hope you guys
