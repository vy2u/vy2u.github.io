so we are starting bear face today I
thought I would mix up a little bit as
you can tell by the title today is a
full up face of nip and fab makeup now
you guys already know I'm a massive fan
of Nippon fab skincare so the fact that
they have a makeup range is kind of new
to me there are some bits I've already
tried but I already love like their
concealer and their bronzing palette but
I feel like not many of you may have
tried or their whole makeup range and I
thought what went away to showcase you
they're full of makeup range by doing a
full face of nib and fab makeup it was
lucky enough to go to their master class
with makeup by Marion or that long ago
where he again showcased all that
incredible stuff so I thought I would
almost like to bring that to you and
recreate that look for you he did kind
of like a warm eye nude lip type vibe
because I feel like that's everyone's
vibe but I'm gonna go a bit more
dramatic it's gonna be more of a matte
lip that kind of thing but still it's
showing you everything I've teamed up
with nip and fab on that this video for
you guys today because they know the
massive fan of them already and I don't
feel like I can just show you guys and
hopefully you'll love it as much as I do
but before we get started if you like
this honor this video make sure to give
it a thumbs up subscribe if you haven't
already and hit that notification belt
let me know when you have done so
because now it is time for a pose
notification belts are out which goes to
a recreated
MUA O'Brien that says always have post
notification on I love all of your
videos by far best personality on
YouTube oh my god
thank you so much I can't really tell
what your name is but I'm gonna call you
anyway O'Brien thank you so much but
without further ado and let's go ahead
and get started and first of all we're
gonna start with skincare I've got some
amazing products to try
okay so to begin I'm gonna be using on
my favorite products that you guys know
I'm obsessed with these already
it is the Nippon fab glycolic fix daily
cleansing pads these are amazing for
just kind of X helping to exfoliate your
skin getting rid of any kind of dead
skin cells any leftover makeup just
really a cleansing your skin before
moisturizing and priming that way your
makeup is gonna sit kind of the best
possible way on your skin and also look
its best
why I also love about these is that they
contain a glycolic acid which is amazing
at retexturizing the skin I Jackie ina
used to rave about glycolic acid and
then I tried it and it honestly makes it
such difference it's made the biggest
difference in my skin so these are just
kind of like a really easiest step to do
in my makeup routine now next up I am so
excited to try this if you like sheep
masks like me then you should be as
super intrigued by this this is the new
fab ultra illuminating dewy primer mask
I love sheet masks I love feeling
they're like pampering this from it I
feel like it's kind of just like a a
nice little way to like unwind so before
you start like the effort that is your
makeup routine this sounds is so cool I
know that they do a mattifying one as
well but I like my skin to look super
dewy so the fact that this says ultra
illuminating dewy this is gonna be right
up my street they're launching on June
the 20th
in superdrug so you can't get your hands
on them yet but I feel like I'm gonna
try it out now and let you know how it
goes so I'm just assuming you obviously
just you just open it up and apply it
like you would a normal sheet mask this
one it says to leave on for 10 to 15
minutes oh my god
I'm gonna look like The Tin Man it looks
like this so says you have to apply up
directly onto clean skin which is great
because we've just kind of used those
pads to a cleanse so it says to apply
directly onto the skin and to leave for
10 to 15 minutes my god I love these
this feels so good right now okay so
we're gonna leave this on 10 to 15
minutes let's set a timer hey Siri set
timer for 11 and a half
minutes okay your timer is set for 11
minutes and 30 seconds see then all
right let's peel this Oh
oh my god my face feels so like wet and
moisturize oh my god I love this feeling
if you have like dry or dehydrated skin
this might be a great priming
alternative if you have you know that 10
to 15 minutes in the morning to do so
but basically just says after you take
off the sheet mask you just massage the
rest into wipe your face and your skin
for a dewy illuminating moisturized base
prepped ready for foundation so let's
move on to foundation now that that's
dried actually it definitely has more of
at actor which again is a great
indicator for a good primer so their
foundation is just like this I think I
got the shade 40 which is slightly more
tanned I'm hoping it might be too dark
but I do have a lighter concealer here
to lighten it up if needs be I've never
tried their foundation before so let's
go ahead and try it reminds me of the
Mac face and body bottle but I feel like
the coverage is a little bit more full
which is obviously what I like you guys
know I always love to do my skin first
which is why I'm doing so but obviously
it feel free to do your eye makeup first
if that's what you prefer I have no idea
how much of this I'm going to need I'm
just gonna be a blending it and oh he
caught the color is isn't as tight as I
thought so we okay okay so I can see the
coverage is a really nice cut a medium
buildable coverage it's blending out
super easily and actually with the
sponge a little is going a long way and
I don't really think I need anymore I
really like that coverage like I said
it's more like a medium I could
definitely amp this up to a super full
coverage if needs be I feel like this is
going to be a nice kind of everyday skin
look vibes so I'm really happy with that
next up is concealer and I have used
this before and I am obsessed with it
I'm obsessed with the applicator it
like a little a little brush to it and I
said this in a previous video this is
great if you like doing your eye makeup
fast and you love a lot of winged out
liner looks like super sharp ones this
is such a great concealer to like really
get close up underneath it because of
its brush today I'm going to be using
the color 15 and I'm just going to
squeeze up like this and just apply it
directly underneath my eye we are going
to be doing a winged look today but kind
of more just like adding a little wing
to a look it's not gonna be super shot
or anything like that so I feel fine
doing this person if I need to tidy up I
will but it's a really nice brightening
for coverage concealer I'm just gonna
use the tapered end up my sponge to
blend this ow
I'm gonna put it on my eyes as well cuz
this is a really good consider for
priming your eyes too but you can see
the coverage from that is amazing this
is kind of the initial product that made
me really look into Nippon fab makeup
their conceal it was the first thing
that I tried and when I saw the coverage
from it and like the color range I was
like oh they're not playing today and
we're gonna use one of the darker shades
as well
Brylcreem one for you guys know I love a
cream quants war when I'm noticing with
that product there so just like quick to
blend like that really didn't take long
at all and sometimes its foundations
especially full of coverage foundations
and sometimes concealers I'm there like
dabbing away it for like a long time but
I thought that was super quick so that
was the shade 15 I'm now gonna take this
shade 30 which is obviously a deeper
complexion concealer but I'm just gonna
use this as a cream contour and I love
the brush applicator for this as well
because I can be really you know kind of
precise with my placement it's gonna
place own everywhere that I usually a
word wanna warm up and a bronze and just
use my brush to blend it out this is my
trusty blank canvas cosmetics duo fiber
brush yeah just work it all into the
skin
almost like apply too much because I
keep forgetting a little goes a long way
with this stuff become work your
Beautyblender and to blend that out I'm
liking this color because it's slightly
a cooler tone
so what's amazing me for like the
contour side of things I'll use the
bronzer palette to add like a bit more
you know like warmth to the look but
this is a really nice kind of cream
contour color
it definitely has cool undertones to it
I feel that sometimes hard to find and a
darker concealer because a lot of the
time they're just all very warm in tone
okay I'm loving the look at that I feel
like that blended out really nicely
I feel like less is definitely more with
those concealers you get so much kind of
pigment out of as a deist drops and
hence why I have to just go back and
with my sponge because I was a little
over generous and we don't want to be
looking like a fool so now I'm going to
go ahead and kind of set everything in
place with powder and for that I'm going
to be at taking the loose powder from
Nippon fab but this one is in the o2
banana shades as you can see obviously
just comes in a more of a yellow
undertone which I've been loving at the
moment it also comes with a little
makeup booth if you like to use them but
I'm just going to be taking my little
brush and just kind of setting
everything in place they obviously do
this color in translucent as well if you
don't prefer anything with you know a
color to it but I've just been loving a
yellow powder at the moment I think it
looks a little bit more natural it still
does the job but almost just helps to
blend everything together and this one
so far looks really nice I don't feel
like it's suddenly like drying up on my
makeup like I've got definitely I've got
a few powders that as soon as I apply to
the skin it goes like and I just feel so
like dry underneath my eyes and stuff
but this one's just kind of really
sitting everything in place giving me a
really like flawless finish right now
okay that honestly has to set everything
in place without feeling too too dry so
now is the next step for me is eyebrows
so I'm gonna go ahead and use that
eyebrow pencil and chestnut as you can
see it's definitely more of that like
brow definer type shape and vibe so I'm
going to zoom you guys in and let's see
how this works okay so like I said I'm
gonna be taking the
Hasnat eyebrow pencil and it's
definitely that kind of softer brow
definer type vibe it comes with a little
spooley on the end which is always good
just to kind of brush through your brows
then just kind of doing it the way I
usually would oh it's just like to trace
underneath my brow with brow definer
they're definitely more of like a
natural looking brow and this one is
definitely more like a waxy type feel so
I feel this would be perfect or like an
ideal brow pencil if you have kind of
naturally a full brows anyway I mean
this is still working for me and I don't
have naturally full brows but if you
just want like a quick bit of added
color and fullness this would work
really well but the kind of me is really
good this is if you think you've got a
similar hair color to me like I said
this is the color a zero for chestnut
and then I'm just gonna kind of feather
the product through the front of my
brows and then finally I'm gonna take
the Nippon fab concealer because of that
bristle like the brush tip it makes it
amazing to really help carve out your
brows so I'm just gonna use the brush
it's really helped get that shape and
clean everything okay so that is my
eyebrows done I'm now gonna move back on
to it the skin okay so I know we kind of
cream up bronze and contoured with that
darker concealer but just to kind of
emphasize it and kind of warm up the
skin a little bit like I said I am gonna
be taking the nip and fab bronzer
palette so this contains too much shades
and too shimmery shades you guys know I
love a shimmery bronze as well so this
is perfect for me this one is in the
shade zero one bronze and I'm just gonna
be taking this matte shade here which is
called soft tan I'm just kind of
applying that where we put the cream
bronzer pretty much and I've used this
before already in a tutorial and I love
just how natural the color is it really
just adds a kind of perfect amount of
warmth and like golden Ness to the skin
without anything to you know like orange
looking and then I am gonna be a dipping
a big fluffy brush in it to a bronze
which is their kind of shimmery bronzy
kind of color and just dusting that you
know all around where I usually would
you guys know the drill this just kind
of adds like an under globe before you
apply your highlight I just love the way
that it ties everything together and it
kind of just gives a control glory to
the skin I love the way that that just
kind of catches the light so now that's
kind of all the bronzing out the way it
is time for blusher I'm going to be at
taking that nip and fab blush palette
kind of have an array of colors here I
bet you guys can guess instantly what
blush your color I'm going to use I'm
going to use this one here and this is
called a perfect coral this is the one
that Mario used on his model during the
master class and it just looked gorgeous
it's like the perfect mix of like
oranjee but with not too much pinky just
kind of adds the perfect flush to cheeks
nothing too heavy and before we apply
our powder highlight it you guys know I
love love love a liquid illuminator and
this is the Nippon fab liquid
illuminator in white gold I know that
they do kind more of a bronzey one and
they do more like a rose gold II one but
I prefer the kind of paler gold ones
because that's the kind of color
highlighter I like to wear so I'm just
gonna do like three drops like so and
take my classic blank canvas cosmetics
he's our teen blending brush and just
work that into my skin oh just caught
that in the viewfinder okay so the final
step for the skin is to apply powder
highlighter on the top I'm just gonna
take the champagne shimmer color from
the bronze palette and just apply that
on the top and again with this one just
take it on the Cupid's bow just on the
tip of your nose so this is the finished
skin I thought I would assume you an
enjoy like a bit of a close up
everything has blended and is sitting on
my skin like a dream I'm obsessed with
that if you like super glowing flawless
skin like this definitely check out
those products down below
now we can move on to the I so I'm not
sure how I'm gonna do that I so I'm
gonna have a little play but we're gonna
be taking the fired up I shadow palette
which looks like this this is screaming
like summer vibes I'm feeling like I'm
gonna go with something with the Pinker
tones to mix up a little bit so I'll be
back to show you how it works
and what I do alright so for this I look
like I said I'm gonna be taking the nip
and fab fired up I shadow palette and
tip again I'm gonna be taking the shade
cinnamon which is this color here and
that is just gonna be our initial
transition color so I'm just gonna be a
thing that and this is like favorite
shade of transition color it's so warm
so pigmented and easy to blend as you
can see like I tapped my brush into that
like two times and there's so much
bigger but it blends so effortlessly
I am gonna be doing like a winged
outlook as you can see not gonna be like
super clean cut I do kind of want it to
be like a rounded shape but kind of you
know in that wings direction you guys
know I'm talking about just buffing that
color in back and forth as you can see
this is definitely more of a cranberry
eyes today so I'm gonna be taking the
shade saffron which is this one here to
further deepen up the crease we're just
gonna be going from light to dark with
the pink undertones this is such a
gorgeous eye look for summer I always
forget how much I love that cranberry
smokey eyes I think they're so pretty
and especially for like evenings in the
summer it just kind of takes like an
every day maybe minimal eye shadow look
just adds that little extra bit of drama
because the colors not very like it's
not like an out-there color but I don't
know if me I'm always thinking that it
is a realistic view and it's on the eye
I think it looks so pretty and it's so
complimentary of so many eye colors I
like I forget how much I love it
following on from that I'm just gonna be
taking this other kind of wore me pink
shade here and this is in the color
brick just to further deepen the crease
before we move on to colors so the lid
color I'm going to be taking this shade
here but then using this shade
to kind of diffuse it into the crease so
initially I'm going to be taking this
raid copper dread and then kind of
blending it in with a fire breather into
the crease so just unlike a small shader
brush and it's gonna be applying the
first color pretty much all the lid and
then just taking that darker Cherie
shade like I said and just kind of
applying it on the transition between
the foiled shadow and the crease colors
just to kind of add a bit more of a
blend and I just think that creates like
a perfect blend and just to kind of add
a little bit more definition before we
move on to eyeliner I'm just kind of
taking the darkest warm color which is
this dark brown shade here called fudge
and just taking a small it defined
fluffy brush and just blending that and
the outer most part I just applied the
kind of shimmery cranberry color that we
have all over our lids underneath our
eye just to kind of tie it all together
before I move on to eyeliner so for
eyeliner I'm going to be taking the nip
and fab eyeliner pen
I love eyeliner pens they make things
it's so much easier and so precise and
easy to create that kind of perfect flip
so I'm just gonna be doing like a medium
sized flip today I kind of thick across
the lid within a little only like a
little wing but feel free to do whatever
eyeliner you feel like doing so just
dragging all the way across and what I
love about this is that it's so black or
right off the first you know like swipe
or drag so once you've kind of done your
line across the lid I kind of use the
tail of my brows like a guidance just to
create a line and then literally just
like that now the eyeliner is done we
can move on to mascara so I'm just gonna
be taking the NIP and it's fab mascara
I'll be using falsies but I thought if
you're not into falsies I will show you
the effects of this so the brush looks
alike in this and I can tell straight
off the bat that it picks up a lot of
pigment and the bristles are super hard
so it makes it really easy to get really
separated and fluffy lashes I come a bit
closer
Gracie I know my eyeliner kind of masks
it slightly but you can just see how its
separated they are right now this has
just given them so much length and
separation I love the way my bottom
lashes look it hasn't transferred at all
but now I'm just gonna go ahead and
complete the look by applying at some
falsies because I feel like they just
make a winged out smokey eye so we'll go
ahead and do falsies and then come back
for the list so these are finished eyes
I love how kind of easy and simple this
was I'm just seeing that the pattern
throughout all of this everything is
made so easy so simple and it all just
looks amazing I love a cranberry I
sometimes and it's always fun to mix it
up but obviously that pallet has so many
different colors that you can mix and
match with there's some cooler tone ones
but obviously you know me I love a warm
tone I think it looks so much better on
my eyes so now let's move on to the lips
so because there's kind of a lot going
on on the eyes I thought it would only
make sense to do a nude combo and that's
the only way for me to really test out a
good product is their news because that
is what I love the most
so I'm going to be lining my lips with
the lip liner in expresso I think this
is called 0/5 expresso is one of those
twisty up ones so I've just gone ahead
and line my lips with that and now I'm
gonna be taking the matte liquid
lipstick in the colour tart because
that's how I'm feeling it's hearty oh my
god I'm just looking at this thinking
this is such a Rachel nude right now I'm
loving it I'm just gonna apply a little
bit of highlight to my kids go the feel
of that liquid lipstick it's like so
nice it kind of feels quite drying in a
good way when you apply I hated liquid
lips that feel wet because I don't
really feel like I have to really apply
to get the pigment from that but
honestly I love that color so this is
the finished makeup look I'm literally
in love with the way that it came out
it's a various signature me look so I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if this
