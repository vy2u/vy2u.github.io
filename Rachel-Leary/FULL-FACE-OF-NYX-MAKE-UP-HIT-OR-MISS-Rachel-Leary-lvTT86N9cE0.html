looking slightly different from the
intro I know but we're doing a lot of
these videos recently so I thought I
would mix it up today we are going to be
doing a full face of NYX Cosmetics
which I am so excited for NYX is one of
my favorite brands ever they do such a
diverse range of products I feel like
they're a brand that's more aimed at
your everyday person as well as your
super creative and artsy person which is
why I wanted to do something a little
more colorful today to kind of show you
some of their more colorful products as
well if you are new here then welcome
make sure to subscribe and hit that
notification bow because we do the
notification shout outs and as per
requested I'm gonna do it at the
beginning of this video this week's
shout out goes to kala Reem or Rihanna
ji said she's a newbie here I definitely
subscribed and hit the notification that
you are super talented thank you so much
for joining us and hitting the bell I
love ya and it doesn't go unnoticed so
yeah if you like the look of the makeup
look that you saw in the intro and you
love NYX or you just interested in NYX
Cosmetics products this is definitely
gonna be at the video for you
so make sure to hit that thumbs up and
to keep on watching so I think for this
look we're gonna start with the eyes
first night I'm just gonna kind of prime
at my eyes and conceal all around my
eyes and do it my brows so for primer
and concealer I'm gonna be taking the
NYX HD concealer in the shade zero for
this shade is slightly lighter than my
natural skin tone but I love anything
that says that is gonna be HD because I
feel like that normally means it's meant
to look pretty good in pictures which is
exactly what we want I love using
concealers as primers as well I think it
just saves you buying an extra product
and they also help to block out of see a
discoloration that you might have and
just make everything just one color so
the color pigmentation just kind of
shows up the same so I'm just gonna be
dragging the concealer down a little bit
as well so just making sure our eyes are
all set and making us look like little
pin eyes I'm just gonna set that with
powder and we can move on to brow so for
brows I definitely am a big fan of their
micro brow pencil already and I was just
gonna use this but I was rummaging
through my drawers and I saw that I had
a few other products from them so I
thought I'll incorporate them all
because some people like to use
different put it for their brows so I'm
really gonna test them out the other
product I'm going to use is the it NYX
eyebrow gel in chocolate now I'm going
to use this kind of towards the tail of
my brow just because I want a little bit
more pigmentation there I also have the
corresponding like brow mascara and
brows set just kind of add a little bit
more fullness and fluffiness throughout
my brow but if say you have naturally at
full brows anyway and barely need to
fill them any you might just want to use
this product so I'm just gonna go ahead
and dispense like a little bit on to the
back of my hand okay definitely a lot
thicker than I thought it was going to
be and I feel like it might be less is
more with this product I'm just gonna
take my anastasi out Beverly Hills
eyebrow brush in the number 14 which is
just like a really small precise angled
brush and just dip it in and start to
fill in the kind of outer most part of
my eyebrow so like I said this isn't the
color chocolate so good the pigmentation
of this is really really nice
I really like the color as well it's not
as dark as I thought it was going to be
which I kind of like you can definitely
apply more to deepen and darken em if
you want so just apply that through the
kind of like tear of my brow and now if
you're more of a pencil person I'm gonna
be taking the NYX of micro brow pencil
in medium brown so just a shade or so
lighter than the pomade that we use I'm
gonna use this to fill and the front of
my brow so I always just kind of like to
drag it across back into the pomade and
then as I get to the front just use kind
of like flicky pick emotions to mimic
the appearance of the brow hairs I
really like those two colors together I
mean I definitely knew I already liked
the pencil but I have not yet tried the
the eyebrow gel but like I said I'm
gonna use the brow mascara as well and
this is in the shade chocolate as well
and just brush that through just make
sure it's all kind of just like set and
locked in place but I will say that
eyebrow gel that I used at the end
everything that I like at that tail of
the brow feels super locked in place and
I feel like it's literally not gonna
budge which is exactly what you want if
you're like me and you have to fake off
your brow anyway the like my nightmare
is that that's gonna just come off and
my real eyebrow is revealed okay so that
is one eyebrow complete I'm gonna go
ahead and do it the other brow
off-camera and I'm actually gonna do one
eye off camera because I have absolutely
no idea what I'm gonna do and also my
camera battery is quickly about to die
so this will give me a little chance to
at charge as well but we'll be back and
I can show you what I did how I did it
and what I came up with so let's go okay
we are doing colorful vibes today so the
first thing I'm gonna take is the NYX in
your element fire palette I'm gonna be
taking the class work me just like I
appreciate this palette is so so
gorgeous
I'm just gonna be taking that yellow
matte shade in the center it's gonna be
a taking a a big fluffy brush this is
the Sigma e35 and just using that as our
initial
now I want to take this color quite high
up into the crease just because I really
want it to show the whole way through
it's gonna like act as our a razor color
as well meaning whenever we go back in
with colors or maybe if we apply a color
too heavy this is the color we're going
to use to buff it out so it is always
visible sticking with the fire palette
we're gonna be taking this peachy orange
shade down here on a slightly a smaller
brush this is a Mac two one seven one of
my favorite blending brushes of all time
and we're just gonna be concentrating
this right into the crease and just
taking it a little bit higher not as
high as the yellow because you can see
when the peach and the yo mix together
they create that gorgeous orange color
and we're kind of keeping it as like a
blown-out shape we want to take this
from inner to outer corner quite heavily
because we're gonna be cutting out the
crease with concealer so the heavier you
kind of apply them into the crease the
better they look and the more they show
following on from that we're gonna be
taking this gorgeous again red pinky
color for the crease and I'm actually
just taking an Anastacio blending brush
that always comes with the little
pallets that they do it's such a good
brush for like crease colors and being
precise with your crease colors because
it's really like firm yet fluffy brush
which is my favorite kind of brush and
like I said dipping back in to that
yellow shade to smooth everything over
and act as our like buffer a razor shade
we are just gonna make our way through
this palette we're gonna take this kind
of rosy deep dark brown here
concentrating this mainly on the outer
third but always making sure to take it
all the way across our lid you can see
it's like kind of messy on the lid but
in the crease we're getting that
transition its lips you just have a
sunset on my eye right now which I am
living for and finally from the same
palette you're gonna take this dark
purple shade who further deepen the
crease again concentrating it where we
put
that color before picking it out with
this shade I don't want to buff it out
too much as I do really want it to be
visible so we are just gonna leave it
like that okay so now all the crease
colors are done I'm just gonna go ahead
and take the NYX HD concealer again to
kind of sculpt out and clear that lid
space up I'm just gonna dispense it kind
of straight on to my eye and then when I
blink down I can kind of see where I'm
being guided to and just gonna use a
little brush to drag it kind of in and
just create that crease we really just
kind of want to block out any color on
the lid so we get a really high
pigmentation from our lid color across
like so okay so for the crease kind of
I'm gonna be it taking the brand-new
love you it's so mochi eyeshadow pallete
they're all such a like spongy texture
inspired by like the Japanese pudding
mochi so they're super super pigmented
and I'm definitely gonna be going for
the blue vibe see because we put such a
warm crease color going on and obviously
blues and oranges and stuff are really
complementary so I'm gonna actually be
mixing this shade and this shade
together to get a really nice pastel
blue going on so to get the color most
up this product I found using kind of
like Wiggly side-to-side patting motions
or work the best to get the color
dispensed on it to your eye because
there's such like a creamy powder
formula I'm also using a mac 242 brush
as well I always find these work best
with like those kind of eyeshadows like
the color pop eyeshadows and stuff this
brush or your finger I find it gives the
best kind of payoff but oh my god I am
obsessing with this pastel blue and
these kind of like buried tones and
oranges together I think they really
make each other stand out I'm just gonna
dip my fluffy brush back into that red
shade from the elements palette and just
kind of create a soft transition from
the blue into the matte crease shades
just so it really blends softly and
diffuses and it's not just like a super
harsh finish yes I am
living I am gonna be doing eyeliner
today but just like one that finishes
around here it's not like a wing or
anything if you think a wing would look
better with this feel free I just feel
like the last look I did was a wing so I
wanna mix it up so I'm just gonna be
taking the NYX a black epic mousse liner
so I'm just gonna be taking my Sigma E
11 eyeliner brush and taking this all
the way across
kind of wish it was a little more black
I thought I'd mine's quite quite old so
maybe mine's kind of dried out a little
bit so I did find I kind of had to build
that color up a lot but other than that
it was super easy to apply stupid me I
had someone left me a comment on my last
video that said I should test out
mascara before doing eyeliner so you can
really see and I completely forgot which
is super annoying because they've just
come up with a brand new mascara which
is the worth the hype mascara the brush
looks like this so a super big fluffy
brush but we are gonna be applying some
NYX lashes after this so we only need a
light coat anyway and I do find actually
that brushes like this do not really
apply just like a light coat they don't
pick up too much product and they kind
of create more of a super fluffy
fluttery lash which I'm hoping you guys
are still gonna be able to see I feel
like you can still see them they look
super lengthened separated and really
fluffy as well which I love but like I
said we are gonna be applying lashes and
I'm just gonna take the NYX amplified
lashes which look like this that's the
kind of Tree on this side that's
the kind of vibe that they give so I
think they really complement this look
well so I'm gonna wait till that glue
dries and then I'll probably go over a
little bit with eyeliner to cover it but
then now we can move on to the skin okay
so moving on to the skin I'm actually
gonna use the NYX juhi finishing spray
just to kind of hydrate my skin and add
a little bit of tack to it and moisture
I know it's a finishing spray but why
not so this is also a new product for me
this is the NYX total control primer I'm
not sure they're if they've come out
with this yet but I love the next total
control foundation
and I always find corresponding primers
our foundations are meant to work their
best together we are using the total
control at foundation today so I am
excited all to see how this works this
again it reminds me of that milky
consistency that the all ours primer has
and that maybelline primer has this one
actually feels a little more kind of
moisturizing which I really really like
so moving on to foundation like I said
I'm gonna take the NYX total control at
foundation I'm gonna mix the colors true
beige and Boleyn together because I am
literally freshly a baked out of the
tanning oven so this true beige is just
gonna I know it be it's slightly too
light for me but this a golden color is
just gonna match my tan and together
they're gonna create the best shade I'm
gonna take my Beauty Blender to apply
this can you believe that this was white
at the beginning of the day sponge it
into my skin you can see it it matches
my turn with foundation down it we can
move back onto concealer I'm just taking
this thing - before the HD concealer in
the shade at 0-4 I'm just gonna apply
this underneath my eye area and up the
sides of my nose
I'm not taking it all the way up
underneath my eye because we've got that
rounded shape going on so I'm probably
gonna buff that part in last but for the
most part just taking my you-know-what
wow I forgot
I actually drew up eyes I looked at this
and I'd obviously tried it before it was
open in my drawer whatever but this is
nice not being funny what is it with all
these drugstore concealers being so
insane I'm gonna zoom you in and show
you what that looks like up close in
case you can't see like the combination
of that with the foundation has given me
the most flawless base I swear so to set
underneath my eyes I'm actually going to
be taking from the three steps contour
palette the banana shade here and to set
the rest of my face I'm going to be
taking the NYX hashtag no filter powder
in the
honey beige these powders are amazing if
you've tried they like mac mineralize
skinfinish --is they are such an
affordable dupe for that so I'm just
taking that banana shade that has
brightened me up nicely and like I said
just taking that honey beige no filter
powder for the rest of my face
speaking of bronzer I'm taking it that
powder again but this time this is in
the color golden so this is actually the
color of well supposedly the color of
the foundation that I was wearing but
obviously I'm mixed with something
slightly lighter so this is gonna be a
really nice subtle bronzer shade I feel
like I can't go too overboard with that
palette either although some of you
might be like huh
anywho to deepen up that and give us a
little more Kwon soo ah I gotta take
that same palette again but take the
contour color here now this palette is
actually in the shade light and to me
that is such a dark contour color that I
know I'm gonna need to be really really
careful so I'm just really lightly
dipping my brush into this one I'm gonna
buffing upwards definitely build as you
don't go don't go in too heavy-handed
girl okay with bronzing products and
John and just it we can move on to
blusher I love this product by them it
is their NYX
sweet cheeks a blusher palette and I'm
gonna take this gorgeous peachy shade
here just to tie in kind of with the
oranjee colors we've got going on on the
eyes oh yeah yes I just love a peachy
blush ah okay and that color and finally
moving on it to a highlighter I'm gonna
take the new love you it's so multi
highlighting at palette what's cool
about these is that they are super
spongy I don't know if you can see that
they're really interesting formula sorry
I'm going to take my Mac two to four
brush to apply the more kind of
champagne in color I'm just gonna see
what works best with this so obviously
it like I said I'm going to use a brush
first
like a firm bristled brush okay so you
can use a brush with them I wasn't sure
it was going to be one of those products
that works better with your finger but
that's a really pretty but I think this
skin looks so flawless and so pretty I
can't believe that concealer oh my god
yeah okay so that is the skin complete I
am just gonna go ahead and finish up
underneath the eyes probably just gonna
go in with that kind of gorgeous red
eyeshadow and apply mascara I'm actually
also gonna apply the NYX a golden bronze
eye pencil in the eye I've used this in
quite a few tutorials before so I'm just
gonna go ahead and do that and I'll be
back just show you what the finished
eyes look like and then we can move on
it to the lips so these are the finished
eyes oh my god I love that blue if
you're into that pot syv color on the
lid I definitely recommend that I love
you so emoji eyeshadow palette they had
so many gorgeous colors in there and the
skin oh but now we can move on to the
lips I don't want any attention away
from the eye so we are gonna do a nude
Nix off of the most amazing not to
mention colored products but such an
extensive range of nude products I
thought I would show you so I'm gonna be
taking one of their suede lip liners
this is in the color whipped caviar they
do so many colors in that suede lip
liner range I love the color London that
they do as well but moving on to the lip
color I'm gonna take their lip lingerie
in the color satin ribbon the formula of
those you definitely have to a build up
the color nevertheless I love the color
of that one it's such a me color but
moving on I am gonna be applying a lip
gloss and this is the NYX butter gloss
in fortune cookie if you've never tried
this where have you been there butter
gloss formulas are so comfortable to
wear even if it's just on their own or
on top of liquid lipsticks like I'm
doing and this one is more of like the
peachy color so I feel like it's gonna
warm up this lip slightly which is kind
of what I want like
not to mention they smell so yummy so
