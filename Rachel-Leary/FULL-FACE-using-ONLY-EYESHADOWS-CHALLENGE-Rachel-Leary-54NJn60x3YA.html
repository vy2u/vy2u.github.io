you're probably thinking what is going
on here but as you can tell by the title
today I decided to do a full face of
makeup challenge video and this time
only using eyeshadows and I didn't
really just kind of create an everyday
look I did kind of one have some fun
with it and not like market but just
like test out colors and see what they
would look like in an extreme scenario
like this one so yeah went for kind of
bright colors today as you can see and a
really nice blended nude lip yeah
basically just wanted to see what it was
like have a little bit of fun and just
see where the video took me so if you
guys want to watch me it creates this
obviously a gorgeous makeup look using
only eye shadows then loosely watching
okay so we're gonna start with skin at
first so for foundation I don't know
what colors to Hank so I've gone with
these two so this was quite light and
the listeners gonna add a bit of warmth
I'm gonna mainly dip into this one this
is makeup geek features and cream and
then this one is Anastasia Beverly Hills
Party dryer I'm just gonna swirl as
opposed they're just gonna act like
powder foundation isn't it well a
buffing brush into them but maybe not
party dress enter them both god I think
we should I stick with bitches in Korean
really giving me that maximum coverage
that I love to be fair not too bad yeah
color wise anyways British they don't
really think I'm gonna get much more
coverage out of that okay for concealer
I'm gonna take vanilla bean from makeup
geek highlight underneath the eyes
good highlight really trying to brighten
up and like a build up with coverage but
it's not already working down the pitch
of our nose here we go now cause we're
literally using powders we don't have to
set anything with powder so we can go
straight on to a bronzer I think I'm
actually I'm gonna use that party dress
Anastasia Beverly Hills shadow because
that was definitely too dark earlier my
face so hopefully it'll make a good
bronzer maybe slightly too warm for me
to be fair with pigmented eyeshadows a
little go such a long way because he
barely need any of it where is it some
face products you I feel like you need
to like build up lovely to blusher I'm
gonna take this shade here from the Lime
Crime Venus color it's like a shimmery
rose gold color
it's called rebirth
gosh
well I think they look like an absolute
actually it's quite nice blusher color
right on it to highlight now this one's
kind of an easy one because you can just
pick shimmery shadows that you know
we've got on your lid so I am going to
use magic act from makeup geek which is
one of their foiled eyeshadows yes oh my
god I'm one start using this more oh my
god like actually look at the Hat
realistically could have used their like
Kiko - Oh a eyeshadow like I totally
forgot about it but oh my god I'm glad I
didn't because I think I've just found
my new favorite highlighter so I suppose
that is skin done so realistically if
you have quite oily skin this is
probably right up your street it's like
almost using powder highlighters had a
highlighter powder like foundations and
stuff right
eyebrows shouldn't be too hard
considering a lot of people actually do
use eyeshadows anyway I am going to EU
my eyebrows I'm gonna take the color up
fawn from Anastasia Beverly Hills she
said I've only really just got back into
using like powders for my eyebrows like
I always was like religiously using a
pencil and my dip brow and I'm really
sorry that's too warm isn't it odd gonna
take maca from makeup geek slightly
darker Brown because my eyebrows are
super sparse at the moment they need a
bit more pigment but realistically you
do use a lot of powder products on your
face anyway that I shadows can replace
I'm just excited to see how my lips will
turn out that'll be fun won't it yep
gosh
god they look so like orangie oh right
now on to like actual eyeshadow this
should be relatively straightforward I'm
just gonna set my eyelids with that
beaches in cream color that we used on
the skin just to kind of give some sort
of base I feel like doing something
really colorful okay okay so for
eyeshadow we're gonna take burnt orange
from Anastasia Beverly Hills you can buy
this as a single or I'm just using it
from the Modern Renaissance pant I'm
just gonna pop that see when you don't
have a purple eye base look how much for
like a good pull out you get
now taking this nyx palette this is the
NYX ultimate brights palette we're going
to go in with this a bright color here
and just use that to deepen our and warm
up the socket just go back in and build
up as much color on pigmentation as you
want for lid color I'm taking it this at
gold I should have here and this from
Coastal Scents and it's called Bahama
Mama and we're just gonna pack this one
quite a nice orangey cold I thought
would tie in nicely with the orange
crease I'm seriously struggling with
fallout today I don't know that's
because when you haven't got any like
liquid in your face and nothing but to
cling to
and from that same NYX palette I'm just
gonna go in with this color here just a
further deepen and warming up the socket
sticking with that like warm theme this
is just gonna kind of diffuse and blend
everything out as well I'm gonna take
this turquoise color and pop that in my
inner corner just because this video is
already different for me so let's add
some color oh sweet Jesus mother of
fallout get it off god wiser halfway
down my face see oh my god but that just
took it all away now going back in with
this bright orange kind of here we're
gonna run that along with the lower lash
line Lana Lana
oh my god I've never seen what I'm
filming now you can't really avoid
mascara so I'm not gonna wear lashes
because that's just another thing that's
not on shadow so I'm just gonna apply a
coat of mascara so these are finished
eyes something quick colorful now on to
the lips I don't really know what to do
I've got such colorful such bright
colors in front of me maybe I'll go all
out and do purple so from the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance palette
I am gonna take love letter as my lip
liner
let's go for a powerful hombre now I'm
gonna go in with this purple color here
from the scene NYX palette and I'm just
gonna build up like an ombre effect my
god
Wow why do I look so hot I'm gonna take
that pink and place it in the center to
give myself enough highlight actually
let's go me the shimmer for the
highlight this is starry-eyed foiled
eyeshadow from makeup geek oh my god I
feel like we finished so this is the
finished makeup look you could actually
probably if you really put your mind to
it and didn't kind of like take the piss
like I was probably create it something
quite not a nicer lip color or a nice
eye but this is a challenge I just
thought I would oh my god it's a really
big meal I thought overages to have some
fun kind of take the piss a bit and yeah
