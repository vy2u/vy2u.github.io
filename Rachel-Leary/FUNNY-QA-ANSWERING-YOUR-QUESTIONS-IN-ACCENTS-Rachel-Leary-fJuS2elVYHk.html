is a new week it's a Monday don't
normally upload on a Monday but we're
doing it Oh
today we're gonna be doing a Q&amp;amp;A I've
not done one of these in a hot second
and it's always good to kind of keep you
updated with what you guys want to know
lets you get to know me a little bit
more if you are a new subscriber if
you're coming from a different kind of
video and you've not yet subscribed to
my channel make sure you do that now and
hit that notification bow so you are
notified when of my videos go up and
also when you let me know if you'd hit
the notification bell we do shoutouts
which is coming up very shortly but as
you can tell it by the title in today's
video we're going to be doing the Q&amp;amp;A
but with a little bit of a twist I love
doing accents and you guys seem to
really love it when I do accents for
someone actually suggested it to me
which I know she's asked me a few
questions in this video so I'll give her
her little moment to answer your guys
questions in accents chosen by you now I
do have like my certain favorite accents
I like to do but some of you guys have
challenged me and given me some accents
that I've never really done before so
I'm gonna give it my best shot this is
just meant to be a fun light-hearted
video something you can just watch along
and listen to while you do your makeup
find it funny get to know me a bit
better that kind of video which is
actually my kind of favorite videos to
watch as well so if you like the sound
of it make sure to give this video a
thumbs up before we begin but before we
begin it is time it will be a
notification bell shout out times
oh yeah
and today's a notification a post Bell
shout out goes to just macadam who said
the intro of your last media last video
made me we notification Bell one thank
you so much jazz for hitting that
notification Bell
I hope you've seen this video I hope you
appreciate your shout out because I love
you but without further adieu let's get
cracking and start answering your
questions for each
so the first question it comes from a
makeup bike jack and you don't follow
him on Instagram make sure do it make
sure you do is one of my good friends
who's far away us so of course he asked
me to answer a question in a Welsh
accent going if you could collab with
any brand or what would your product be
well I think it would have to be a
pallet of some sort because I associate
myself with pallets warm tones shimmers
highlights
something like that possibly a
highlighter I don't know maybe a bronzy
highlighter what do you guys think what
products would you like to see from me
that you think that I should bring out I
don't know if this is a very good Welsh
accent but I'm trying my best
yeah I think you would have to be some
sort of face product that made you glow
or eyeshadows that made your eyes pop
cuz they're so warm tones I have no idea
red that just went but probably a
palette or a highlighter something like
that because I know you guys associate
that kind of stuff for me all right pet
love Gavin Stacey what's the current OH
the next question comes from the girl
that this video was suggested by just
when you say her name but she's a Shawn
Mendes fan she goes did you like school
American accent um for me school was a
little bit um it was hit and miss like I
like the concept of school I like
learning I liked all the subjects that I
did I love the people in my class
whatever but I don't think I don't know
I had a mixed reputation in school I
feel like I was associated with the
people that I hung out when and some of
their actions reflected on me and a lot
of people didn't like me I got voted
really bad stuff and my yearbook at
school like I got voted most vain all
this kind of stuff and I don't
personally think that I was saying in
school I was never one to go around
thinking that I was beautiful and
flirting with everyone or whatever but
um I don't know I just had quite the
mixed reputation at school I think it
was cause I was quite loud and quite
confident that a lot of people just
liked to hate me and it was probably
more of a popular decision to not like
me than to like me but I had my friends
I love my
I'm still friends with my friends from
school and it's now funny that every
time I see people from school when I'm
out and they're just full of compliments
and it's like oh my god you've done so
well and I'm like are you joking I you
definitely didn't like me in school so
funny how things work out but no I liked
school
I just don't think school liked me does
that make sense I don't know I didn't
okay in school as well grade wise but
yeah I'm a mixed opinions on school the
next question comes from Megan Napier he
says what is your favorite perfume or
fragrance a southern country music
accent well I don't I don't think I'm
gonna have to talk that way out on so my
favorite perfume at the moment has got
to be it's from the body shop oh my god
I literally can't do it southern country
my favorite perfume at the moment oh my
god I know but it would offend anyone
they can't do that shit
it's called Japanese cherry blossom
strawberry kiss was that alright oh but
it's from the body shop and it's the
Japanese cherry blossom strawberry kiss
fragrance it's so damn sweet you're
gonna love it but Shawn Mendes fine
again it said who's your favorite
youtuber to watch in a French accent so
at the moment my favorite youtubers to
watch don't tend to be makeup related I
don't know why I just I prefer actually
that is a lie I sometimes watch makeup
videos and if I do it is Jackie Ayanna I
love her videos she makes it very
entertaining to watch washes also doing
makeup which is what I really really
like I like to be entertained while I am
watching I don't like bowling people
with no personality that is no fun I
also like to watch the S family I think
we all do they are growing so quickly it
is unbelievable and their engagement is
crazy good and I forget how much I like
to watch their videos so I always have
like a few videos of them to watch in a
way which I really like
well I was our family loving Lydia Milan
at the moment I like to watch her love
style videos and see what she is getting
up to I am also really loving Batman
dogs videos at the moment he is so funny
his sense of humor is one that I really
connect with him and many that we do
together was so good but since there are
a few of my favourite youtubers that
allowed to watch at the moment but it
always depends on the mood and I also
love Shane Dawson so we they are my
favorite youtubers Jess says has a best
friend of yours ever betrayed your trust
massively if so how did you do that in a
Julie accent you guys there's been so
many questions with you guys asking me
to do a Geordie accent and I think it's
cause you guys know I love it and maybe
you guys love it when I do it so um I
kind of there's been a couple of
situations where me best friends have
perhaps slept with an ex or something
like that batter a lot of people that's
a no-go you just don't do that whatever
but for me my mentality is a little bit
different and I don't know I don't
really care about that sort of stuff I
know what it's like to be in an intense
situation with someone that you
shouldn't and things happen I totally
get it I mean it says a lot about the
person and just what goes through their
head the fact that they'll follow
through with it and maybe it says a
little bit about how they feel towards
you but I get over it I don't dwell on
things like that's too much that's
really been the only situation that
someone's betrayed me massively but I'm
not I'm not
angered them that's the only best friend
side but how did I deal with it I am a
fan of just talking it out but I have a
way of talking to people that makes you
feel like shit if you've done something
to me I don't really raise my voice
unless I have to
I don't think that's the answer raising
your voice that someone just gets them
worked up and once and gets them to want
to be angry towards you and not it's
just an argument that's not you teaching
them a lesson I just like to talk it out
but I'll just make them feel really
awful about it and that's
how I do that learn know that they're
upset about it and I've made them feel
so sorry that I'll feel a bit better
do you know what I mean but I'm quite
good just thinking about the bigger
picture of things as well so I just
think in a couple of weeks I'm still
really gonna be angry about it because
if I am fine I'll stay angry I'll keep
all that negativity towards that person
whatever but if in reality everything in
I've got bigger things to do I don't
think I'm really gonna give a shit about
this cuz I still want to be friends or
whatever then I'll just see the bigger
picture and I'll always try and be the
bigger person and deal with it talk it
out that kind of thing so they were kind
of the questions that I picked from
Twitter but now I'm gonna go on to
Instagram and it says from sinamay at 93
what would your dream collab brand and
what product would you come out with
German accent happy Easter Rach oh happy
Easter as German accent is something to
exist so I won't say what product
because in case it happens I don't want
someone to take that idea I don't want
to leak my own product you know but in
terms of brands I think it would have to
be something that you would associate
with me so a brand that I use all the
time so I'll leave that up to you you
can leave in the comment section down
below what brands you think I would
collaborate with what the fuck that lets
you manage to sell African but um it
would probably be more of the drugstore
brand type scene because I use them a
lot my audience would be able to get
holder them and I think that's what you
guys associate with me young
Silas C says have you ever had a bad
experience with a youtuber an American
accent love you you guys love the
American accent um a bad experience um
not really a bad experience I've had
experiences where I maybe met them a few
times and I've personally decided we're
not gonna really get on so I'm just not
gonna really try to get on or like I'm
just not gonna try I'm not gonna make an
effort to talk to you if I feel like
it's just gonna be wasted with just our
personalities don't connect or like
whatever like along those kind of lines
but I've also had that done to me as in
in the sense that they obviously thought
that they weren't gonna get on with me
so they've on followed me on things they
don't talk to me there's no effort there
whatever I mean that's just life if not
I'm not done it because I've not done
anything personally to them it's just we
have totally different personalities I'm
not offended I don't hate anyone there's
no beef there there's no tea no shade or
anything like that it's just a conflict
of personalities just I might be too
loud for someone if they're a little bit
more reserved I might be quite
intimidating to them because they think
I'm embarrassing or whatever or vice
versa and I'm putting myself out there
and I'm getting absolutely nothing back
from you because you're just not that
kind of person and you'd rather sit back
and just watch rather than get involved
we won't get on that's just what it is
we'll leave alone there Maryana lemma
map marina lemma I think says what your
plans for summer vacation this year and
his Geordie accent love your videos so I
think many friends are gonna book a
holiday and a couple ideas time portman
and go to Mykonos that's just a girl you
holiday not work-related or anything
like that I know I'm gonna LA in June
which is gonna be work-related which is
going to be so exciting for me I booked
certain holidays but a lot of brand
trips and stuff they just kind of come a
few months before a month before
sometimes even a few weeks before so I
don't always know where I'm going what
I'm doing or anything like that but I
know for sure me and me gals are gonna
try and go to Mykonos and I'm going to
Los Angeles in the salon Chloe at 91 one
that says did you grow up in Australia
if so why in an Australian accent so I
was born in the UK but I was only about
a few months old or maybe one I can't
really remember if I've got to one yet
or whatever and my dad used to work for
a company that involved him traveling a
lot and the opportunity
moved to Australia for a four year
contract came up and while me and my
sister was still young they fought why
the hell not
so we only lived there for four years
but it was because of my dad's job and
we moved back when I was four or five
and I grew up in the UK ever since so I
could I wish I had the like home and
videos of us in Australia because I have
the like most raspy Australian accent
ever and whenever I watch like the Real
Housewives of Melbourne or I'm with any
Australian people or whatever I just
want to start talking in an Australian
accent it literally wants to fall out of
my mouth and not even joking but yet
sorry I lived in Australia for my dad's
job but I am dying for something to
bring me back over there because I still
have family that are over there my mum's
sister actually lives there so yeah that
is why I lived in Australia who would
your Hall Pass be male and female in a
South African accent South African
accents are quite hot - do I have to
think about my orthodontist when I talk
in a South African accent because he
would always obviously speak in a South
African accent I'm guessing a Hall Pass
means someone that I would sleep with
male or female mal I think it would have
to be Zac Effron and female I think it
would have to be Megan Fox Isobel
abatement said what was your first time
like in a Scouse accent I'm assuming you
mean when I lost me the Genesee and all
I can say about that is I was fucking
awkward fucking awkward that's all I can
say really didn't really get to do much
of a Scouts accent for that question
because all I can say is that it was
awkward both was with a boyfriend at the
time so yeah Kiera foster says what do
you look for in a man Irish accent so I
think in a man I have to look for you've
got to be funny if you're not funny
we're not gonna get on like looks fade I
need you to make me laugh for the rest
of me life but obviously I think at
first you've got to be good-looking
there's got to be a sexual attraction
there I like intelligence I like
motivation we've got to be polite as
well I hate people how to rude so yeah
oh you gotta have nice teeth but I
suppose I fall under the category of
good looking and we've gotta have a
similar bond
and you've gotta be not afraid to show
us off and be proud that I'm your
girlfriend
you know what I mean and finally the
last accent is the last question an
accent comes from Chloe Randall that
says most embarrassing moment and you
can and could you do it in an Italian
accent Italian if what if I meet the new
you talk like this and most embarrassing
moment would have to be when I was in
when I was in new I don't do it okay so
I was in Newcastle and I was in a
nightclub and I was chasing after my
friends I don't know if I've told you
the story before but I was chasing after
my friends and I took a tumble
I literally slid on the floor in front
of everybody and I fell I stayed on the
floor for a few minutes I was so
embarrassed I have to be a helped up and
I nearly started to cry because I was so
embarrassed god I think that was really
awful if you're Italian so sorry I don't
know happen that but that is all your
questions I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and saw the funny side of it
and just had a good time watching it you
know if I didn't answer your question
don't worry I'll be doing plenty of Q&amp;amp;A
