today I am doing this olive green winked
out smokey eye which is kind of another
full look I've created for you kind of
stepping away from the dark tones and
thought I'd try something a bit
different most of the products I'm going
to be using in this video are from a
subscription box service called love me
beauty recently they've just completely
redone their website and if you followed
me on social media for a while you know
I've worked with them in the past and
they're just an incredible UK obviously
like I said earlier subscription box are
there you automatically receive 60
credits to spend in the boutique every
month or you can pick items that you
want oh then experts decide for you you
can buy optional credit add-ons or
continue to purchase throughout the
months at like one of their like
exclusive prices which i think is bruni
handy and also the boutique is filled
with it's not just makeup it's filled
with skincare nail products and loads of
exclusive brands which i think is
amazing like to face lord and various
stuff like that so throughout the video
i'll always mention whether or not you
can get this product from the love me
beauty subscription I'm using other
products as well but yeah just thought I
would showcase some of the stuff that
you can get I also have a discount code
for you guys you can use the code Rachel
54 50% on your first month's box so you
would get it for just five pounds which
is incredible everything that you get
isn't only a luxury sample size and
sometimes maybe even a full-size product
so you can't really beat it so if you
like the look of this makeup look then
please keep watching so to begin I have
already kind of prepped my skin and done
my eyebrows to do this I Reese officer I
just I've washed my face and stuff
before applying makeup as always but
recently I've been in Abby's bio enzyme
mask in particular the hydrating one
just because the products I've been
using at the moment I've kind of tried
to make sure have a lot of hydrating
qualities to them codes in the colder
months I found my skin to get really dry
so I want to do all I can to make sure
it's receiving as much moisture and
hydration as possible so these hide
masks have been amazing after look like
a shower or I've washed my face they're
kind of scary like the king it's in like
it's kind of obvious where each it goes
on your face like this but they feel
like the most moist radiator word moist
hydrating like sheets and you press them
onto your skin they feel incredible
they're such like a luxury pamper
treatment like if you're in like line in
the bath or something like that these
are amazing you leave them on for like
10 minutes or so and then take them off
and wash your face and apply your
moisturizer or something like that and
it just leaves my skin feeling so good
speaking of moisturizer what I found
especially more like I said in the
colder months oils to be really good and
this is one of the nude oils you only
need a few drops of this and you can
really feel it moisturize and hydrating
your skin it's one of the lovely beauty
products and so is that mask yeah you
can use this alone or you can mix it in
with the moisturizer I've been finding
liking it just on its own just because I
find that that does enough for me in the
more colder months I definitely prefer
using an oil like this maybe in the more
summer months I kind of preferred to use
something like this which was this more
of a serum this is the comfort zone
sublime skin serum so something like
this I use kind of more in the summer
because it's more moisturizing it wasn't
so heavy whereas something like this in
the more colder months where I find my
skin to get really dry definitely does a
better job but both amazing and both
some of the lovely beautiful apps that
you can get after my eyebrows I've
recently been loving using the Kiko
number 3 brow pencil and to set it in
place I'm just going to use the model
comb or brows browser now onto the eyes
so to start off I've already primed my
eye with my Maybelline Color tattoo in
the color creme de Rose next I'm gonna
highlight my inner corner and brow bone
using the bellapierre pigment in the
shade snowflake this is one of the items
that can choose to get in your lovely
Beauty subscription so I'm just going to
use a pencil brush and a carboxyl e
then it using this eyeshadow from
anastasia beverly hills in the shade
thorn in my crease
then using this makeup geek eyeshadow in
the shade to further deepen the socket
as a base I'm gonna take this makeup
geek foiled eyeshadow in the shade
yes sir then over the top of that
pressing this bellapierre pigment in the
shade reluctance this is also another
product that you can get in your lovely
beauty subscription box and I have to
say it's one of the most oh it is the
perfect olive shade to blend out the lid
shade and the crease shades I'm taking
the shade dirty martini from makeup geek
then on the clean blending brush I'm
just going to buff the Cree shade in
with that color too then I'm going to
mix fawn and preppy together on a fluffy
brush and just buff that back into the
crease then I'll nail it cotton bud I'm
just going to clean up the edge I'm then
going to go ahead and do a winged liner
but I'm going to go ahead and do this
with camicus I always end up going out
the screen but I do have a winged liner
tutorial and as always I will leave that
in the description bar below then I'm
going to go ahead and apply mascara this
is a deluxe sample of the Too Faced
better than sex mascara if you choose
this as one of your lovely beauty
products I'm then going to go ahead and
apply lashes are from SCE toe and are in
this style viola
I'm going to use my lovely Beauty
tweezers to do so and if anyone was
wondering what was on my nails at the
moment cuz I'll probably get a lot of
comments on it is this Lottie
nail varnish in the shade bring me joy
which is like a really gorgeous French
pale pink color and that's a lovely
beauty product ooh
before finishing off the rest of the
eyes I'm gonna go ahead and do my face
for foundation I'm going to be using the
Jojo Armani luminous silk in the shade
six
for concealer I'm going to use the la
girl Pro conceal in the shade natural
and I got this from Amazon
then our before setting anything with
powder I'm going to use cream blusher
from model Co in the shade Just Peachy
to add a bit of color to my cheeks it's
gonna blend that in with my finger
again you could pick this to me one of
your products and your lovely beauty box
and then going to set my under eye
concealer with my Studio Fix powder then
going to bronze up my cheeks using a
deluxe sample of the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer the fact that I UK
subscription box does has like deluxe
samples of toothpaste and I think that's
pretty cool considering there's such a
massive American brand and normally with
some subscription boxes you kind of just
get brands that you've never really
heard of that I think everyone's out of
toothpaste with the skin done I'm gonna
move back onto the eyes I'm gonna go
back in with my bellapierre pigment in
the shade reluctance and just put that
just here on my lower lash line
then for the rest of the lower lashline
I'm going back in with the anastasia
beverly hills i shadow in the shade form
then just finishing them off with a coat
of mascara
now onto the lips I don't really want to
use anything that's going to steal any
focus from the eyes so I'm using these
to laud and very lipsticks this is one
of their sheer lipsticks in the shade
must-have which is like a really nice
dark nude shade and on the top I'm going
to be applying one of their Lord and
berry shining lipsticks and this one is
in the shade 2 over 100 I think but it's
just a really nice light nude and I'm
going to apply this over the top these
lipsticks now amazing
so this is the finished look I really
hope you guys like it something a little
different for fall compared to all the
kind of dark vampy looks that are going
around at the moment I feel these other
tones these olive cocky tones are really
coming in to start at the moment with
clothing and stuff like that I would
incorporate a look using those kind of
tones if you like any of the products
that I mentioned that were from love
maybe - make sure to check out their
website below they recently like I said
earlier just completely redone their
whole website and it looks incredible
and also don't forget to use the code
Rachel 54 50% off your first box which
would only mean that it is five pounds
since they're ten pounds already which
is an amazing deal for some of the
products that you can pick so make sure
to check out their website and I will
link that down below give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and let me

future thank you so much for watching
