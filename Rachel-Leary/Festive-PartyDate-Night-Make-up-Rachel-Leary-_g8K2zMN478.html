I've started with my base and eyebrows
done I will leave all products I've use
in the description down below and then
going in with my Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in the shade light warm in all
the normal places that I would highlight
and just blending that out with my
realtor
- cream contour I'm using my Bobbi Brown
foundation stick in the shade number 7
almond and just placing that in my
cheekbones on the tops of my forehead
and along at my jaw and then just
bending that's blending that out with a
duo fiber brush
to set and emphasize all the places that
I've used my concealer i'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder and my
Sigma powder brush and just like I said
placing that I'm not necessarily baking
but I am placing a heavy amount of
powder and I am going to sweep away the
excess and also just personally
underneath where you contour just really
accentuates that point also our Lord
to essentially set the cream contour
that we did I'm using my bronzer in map
in Mac give me sir my Mac bronzer in
give me son
for blusher I am using it this elf blush
in the shade tickled pink and just
listen that really it softly onto my
cheekbones to highlight my cheekbones
I'm using the Mac highlighter in oh
darling and I know this was limited
edition and I'm pretty sure it's sold
out now but a really good joob is the
Kiko - Oh a eyeshadow or the anastasia
beverly hills highlight it in so
Hollywood and I know both of them a
permanent and you can get the Anastasia
highlight is on at cult Beauty next onto
eye makeup I'm using the morphe 35o
palette and just these two soft brown
shades keeping the shape of this around
as it's gonna be a halo eye and just
buffing that into my socket using my Mac
2 to 4 brush really softly then using my
lorac unzipped palette taking this mode
shape just concentrating this on the
outer quarter of my eye or the outer
third of my eye and also on the inner
third of my eye and we're going to build
up the intensity of each eyeshadow to
create the halo but also making sure to
connect them into the socket so I'm then
taking this slightly darker brown shade
on a smaller fluffy brush and like I
said just keeping that on the outer
third and the inner third of the eye but
still connecting is through the crease
for my sense of this shade I'm mixing
these two foiled eyeshadows from makeup
geek in the shade in the spotlight and
starry eyes I think and just using a
really small flat shader brush just to
concentrate this like I said in the
center of my eye and then softly
diffusing the edges using the fluffy
brush that we used earlier then at
taking my Too Faced shadow insurance
glinted blue and my violet will splitter
in the shade champagne kisses just
placing the glue over the top of the
tooth world shadows and then pressing
begins on the top
then taking this really dark purple
shade on a flat shader brush I'm just
placing that on the broody inner most
part of my eye and on the outermost part
of my eye just to create that gradient
effect of dark to light going into the
center to really enhance the spotlight
effect
going back to my morphe 35o palette and
just taking this matte white shade and
just highlighting my inner corner and my
brow bone
but this is the eye look with just
mascara you could just leave it there
but I'm gonna go in with lashes and I'm
going in with a slightly more rounded
shape and these are the rich fluffy
lashes I think from valor and as you
guys do I do have a discount code so you
guys can get your hands on these for
money off to then I'm basically
recreating what I did on the top on the
bottom just using the first Modi shade
to create the outer shadow parts and
then using the in the spotlight shadow
in the center and then taking his crema
graphic pencil from maxsa in my
waterline and applying mascara to my
bottom lashes and that is the thighs
completed the good thing about this is
that you can use any lip color to go
with it but I wanted to go with
something quite movie just as like a
statement festive looks so I'm using a
catnip Anastasia liquid lipstick and
then it was a bit too intense for me so
I'm going in with this nude gloss from
Tanya burr cosmetics on the top and that
is the mocha completed I really hope you
guys enjoyed this makeup lips let me
know if you guys recreate it by tagging
me on instagram and also let me know in
the comments below future videos that
you want to see I do have a few lined up
I always love to hear your ideas but
until next time I will see you soon bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
