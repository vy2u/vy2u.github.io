today I'm gonna be doing a video on how
I personally achieve a flawless
foundation appearance for like going out
if I know I'm gonna be doing something
that's gonna take all day and I need my
makeup to last these are kind of steps I
will take to kind of create the most
picture-perfect looking face makeup that
I can so I'm not showing you my eyes my
eyebrows anything like that it's kind of
foundation concealer highlights and
contour slash bronzer so I hope you
enjoy and let's get so first things
first I'm gonna start off by using my
Urban Decay makeup setting spray to
rehydrate and set my face before because
if you want this to last a really long
time like you're going out or something
like that by saying spray like this is
gonna be your best friend and then I'm
going to put over the top the Mac
natural radiance prep and mine primer
just because I personally have quite dry
skin and I need something that's gonna
be really hydrating especially if I know
I'm gonna be playing a lot of product on
my face and I'm using my luck c510
foundation brushes to apply my primer
just because I just like
and also if you find that like you got
oily or something I would pop please an
oil control primer or just apply primer
in the places that I get oily but
because I don't like just have dry skin
I just apply a hydrating primer all over
my face when they get really dry between
my eyebrows so make sure not to forget
there and then I'm going to let that set
for a couple of minutes just because
paying foundations straight onto another
liquid kameena it's going to slip and
slide around your face you're not going
to get the flawless finish that you're
after them so this is obviously a
personal preference and it's how I
personally achieve the kind of flawless
look and I feel like people can say what
they want and stuff but you can't really
achieve a flawless finish when you
haven't bought tons of makeup on so
I'm going to be wearing two foundations
the first one I'm going to be using is
the make up ever HD foundation in the
shade 1 to 7 and I love this wonderful
if I don't need me going out people even
taking pictures because there's nurse
the F in it so you're not going to get
that white cast reflected back in your
pictures and then once I put this on I
like to go in with my Mac Studio Fix in
NC 30 for that extra coverage in the
bits that I need
most so I need the most coverage on my
cheek areas so that's why I've applied
the most product and I find the most
effective way to get a full coverage
it's using a flat top brush so this is
from BH Cosmetics and it's just a really
nice flat top kabuki style brush and I'm
just going to be buffing this into the
skin but also pressing in at the same
time and I'm going to be more pressing
in the studio fix foundation so with
this one I can press and buff where's
the Studio Fix I just press that into
the bit so I need the most coverage also
make sure to take it down onto your neck
because you to get the best we look like
yet overall look of your foundation what
a matching your foundation color to the
kind of your neck obviously if my neck
is much darker than my face just because
of fake tan so that's why my foundation
may look
so this obviously isn't like an everyday
foundation routine like I would never
work this much foundation on a
day-to-day basis but if we're going out
and you really want it to last I feel
like I would take the extra steps to
foundations so that's what was one layer
of the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
looks like and you can totally vaz that
if that's the kind of if this is
flawless enough for you then just leave
it as that but I personally just like to
go with a bit more so I'm going to go in
with my Mac Studio Fix foundation is NC
30 and just not all over my face and
just the bits that I still have a bit of
like coloration and texture let's say
like I'm using a patting motion to do
this
gonna zoom in and show you what that
looks like so to highlight and more more
- like conceal I've been really loving
at mixing my mac prolongwear concealer
in the shade NC 35 and my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade
Chantilly so this is the lightest one
and then this is quite a dark concealer
that's Alma it's slightly dark then my
foundation but when I mix them together
it gives me a really subtle concealing
find here and then I'll be I'll add a
bit more of this if I want a bit more of
a highlight and I'm gonna be using my
more Fiat Jeep - blur brush brush so I
apply this and blend it
and so this is what it's good to
especially to know if you're going out
and you're having kind of more like a
dramatic eye doing your eyes first
before your foundation because then you
can use the concealer and stuff to kind
of sharpen any lines if you need to
instead of having those that fall out
and then you ruin all the effort that
you put into a foundation just do it
build it hair hair hair one of my notes
just to even out
and then I find to kind of make it last
the longest time using powders to
contour with and bronze up your skin so
I'm gonna go ahead and set my face with
powder now because I'm not gonna be
adding any more creams so to set my
under eyes I'm going to be using Mac
mineralized skinfinish and light just
because I love these to sit under the
eyes especially with creams as in
setting creams just because they've been
baking for 24 hours so they're designed
to absorb any oils that your skin
naturally produces and give you a really
nice natural matte finish rather than
making little really thick and caked on
it's kind of designed to work with
liquids rather than masks
I'm just gonna be using my blank canvas
f15 kind of like tapered brush supply
this
then just set the rest of my face and
I'm using this new product from NARS and
it's the all day luminous powder
foundation and I'm just gonna be lightly
dusting there I'm actually use a
technique and I'm gonna link the video
down below that Wayne of course recently
did a video on that he's learned from
the makeup artists Sonia and Weiser I
think it is I'll link the video that he
talks about it down below but basically
using your powder and like a light
contouring brush like this just buffing
it into the skin to give you a flawless
finish - you're doing it recently and
I've started actuate to work rather than
just like brushing a crystal place like
dabbing it just using circular motions
to buff it in I find really works and
this is in the shade Fiji
like I'm hardly applying any pressure at
all and it just gives the most finish
I'll see you and once I've finished but
I just want to share this technique with
you because I loved it where now he did
a video on it let me zoom you in so
still a really full of coverage but
without looking too thick or too cakey
on the skin which I Finn is their kind
of best of both worlds and it's kind of
what everyone at once so now on to
forums and up the skin I am going to use
this new sculpt and glow up forever nude
palette by BH Cosmetics that's got a
really a nice full tone contour shades
in it because I find using cool shades
to contour with the NYX shadow and looks
nice realistic by I'm gonna go in with
bronze after with we're just gonna be
using this angled brush from BH
Cosmetics but another name I'm just
taking a mix of the two I can only paint
it
mix it the two top most of it off and
just press that into the cheekbones
next for bronzer I'm going to be using
my map care blend post powder in the
shade dark so it's just basically a
matte bronzer shade on a zoeva luxe
cheek finish one to six brush and I'm
going to go summers at the tops of my
forehead
bring it down just place it above
slightly way you've just contoured
and then just don't do my neck and cheek
that area
and then I just sometimes like to go in
with the brush that I used to powder
with and just go in with whatever's left
on the brush and just go underneath just
to kind of tidy up the edge
next under highlighter and I've got this
new one from a crown recently crown is I
feel a really understated makeup brand
they do brushes which is kind of what
they're most known for but their makeup
they sent me some makeup to try and this
really stood out it says it's a bronzer
and it's their sun kissed bronzer but it
is the most gorgeous highlighter as
you'll see it's so pigmented sieved you
have to tap off quite a lot of it but
I'm just going to apply this really kind
of sparingly on the tops of my
cheekbones down the center of my nose
and on my Cupid's bow
it's got like gorgeous champagne
peach undertones and I've not got
anything like this highlighter wise I'm
just using a sigma f-35 tip to highlight
brush tip -
so back it for the face you can go ahead
and apply blush if you want you know
huge blushes and myself so I'm gonna
skip that step but I'm just gonna finish
off my eyes and do my lips and then I'll
show you the finished result so this is
the finished look I just put some shadow
underneath my eyes and hugs and bottom
lash and scar and then I put my NYX
matte lip cream in Cairo and Cinderella
gloss in glass slipper on the top and
but that's it for the skin and the
foundation and I hope you guys learned
something new and in how to achieve a
flawless flawless face makeup for going
out or just if you know that you're
gonna be wearing it all day I find that
this really works for me and I hope it
