today I wanted to film something that
I'd seen requested loads in my comments
which is basically just something a lot
more natural and wearable personally I
like to wear a full face of makeup all
the time of SIA when I keep things kind
of diverse on my channel and accommodate
for everyone and so this eye look is
literally no lashes just mascara there's
like two shadows on my eyes really
lightweight foundation as well so I
really hope you guys enjoy this is kind
of a perfect summer evening when it's
really hot and you're on holiday you
don't know wear much makeup but you
still want to look put together that
kind of look is that make sense so I
hope you guys enjoy I also just wanted
to say um because not yet said on my
channel yet thank you so so much for a
hundred thousand subscribers I never in
a million years thought that me posting
my first like Halloween makeup video
would lead to something like this it's
incredible and I just wanted to thank
you all so so much and I've been doing a
lot of thinking about like my channel on
my Instagram and like my videos and
stuff like that
and I definitely want to invest in a
curved vlogging camera and do a lot more
folk style videos which would mean um
like better Instagram video into my
bootys Instagram pictures as well like I
don't really have a theme on my
Instagram and I feel like that's what I
want to do but at the moment also just
let you know I'm like in the middle of a
revision and stuff like that for exams
cuz I still do go to college so that's
why videos are kind of always have been
weekly but as soon as they're over I
plan to come up with a schedule of when
to post videos so you guys let me know
in the comments down below like what
kind of days you want me to post I feel
like it'll be like a Tuesday Thursday
and a Sunday or like a Monday Wednesday
and
and that's let me know in the comments
which one you prefer but after this
longest intro ever let's just get
started on the makeup so obviously to
start off I have a clean fresh face and
to prep my skin for foundation I'm using
my mac fix+
just spritzing that all over my face and
then using this product from soap &amp;amp;
Glory which is the instant visual floor
softening illuminator just buffing that
into my skin to add a bit of glow to my
skin to look all that in place and just
officially pry my skin I'm using my
Smashbox primer water again just
spritzing that all over my face
for foundation I'm using my Mac face and
body foundation in the shade c3 yeah
it's a tiny bit darker than my actual
skin tone but it matches my neck
perfectly and it looks like I've put on
a lot but it's just a very fluid
foundation so it drips down my face very
quickly it's very very light coverage
but you can build up and you want to but
for this video I just kept it to one
layer because a lot of you guys have
been requesting something a bit more
natural next up is brows I thought I
would go in a bit more depth because I
haven't already but I can do an in-depth
tutorial you want to see it I'm using
the brow artery pencil from soap &amp;amp; Glory
which is a huge dupe for the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow as we've been wanting
to try that you should try this first I
just like to line the bottom of my brows
and then fill in the tail and then
gradually feather it to the beginning of
my brow or the front of my brow and then
I tend to be quite harsh at the front of
my brow and then I go in with a
foundation brush just to buff out and
stuff in it and then just use kind of
upward strokes to kind of mimic as
you'll see what I mean
so with both eyebrows done I'm moving on
to the eyes I've already primed my eyes
with my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I'm
just using a pencil brush to highlight
my inner corner and brow bone using
Mac's shroom eyeshadow
then using a sigma e 38 blending brush
I'm taking the shade bamboo also from
Mac this is a pro shade so you can get
it in Pro stores or online I'm just
blending that into the crease it's just
a really light soft brown color you
could probably just use a bit of bronzer
to do this if you wanted to keep it too
minimal products then I'm taking Mac
blunts gold pregnant again this is a pro
product but you can get it online and it
just spends blending that all over my
lid and then going in with a smaller
map-21 seven blending brush and going in
with the same bamboo shade again just to
soften out the pigment
and that's it's a shadow I told you it
was minimal next on to mascara I'm using
my favorite mascara it's the Mac
extended play it is amazing at defining
and lengthening your lashes so if you
have kind of shorter lashes that need a
bit more length to them and also a bit
of separation this is your mascara to
get fun to concealer I'm going to be
using two which is just a personal
preference this one is where both NARS
radiant creamy concealer this one's in
the shade custard which is praised
basically yeah bang on my skin color and
I'm just using that to conceal any bags
under my eyes and just kind of color
correct and add a bit more coverage to
my skin and then I'm going to be using
the lightest shade in Chantilly just
under my eyes a bit of a highlight
to set that all in place I'm gonna be
using my NARS
pressed translucent light reflecting
powder just to sit under my eyes to
finish off the eyes I'm taking two
eyeshadows mixed together both by Mac
texture and bamboo just running that
under my eyes and a pencil brush really
softly and blending it out just to kind
of finish off the eye look and make it
look a lot more put together and then
again just apply my mascara on my bottom
lashes and that is the eyes officially
done finish off the face I'm kind of
merging two products in one this is the
Bobbi Brown highlighter in the shade
bronze glow but on me it is definitely
more of a shimmery bronzer so instead of
having a bronzer and a highlighter I
thought I would use this one it also
adds a gorgeous glow to the skin so it
really emphasizes on that fresh look I'm
just applying that on my cheekbones on
the tops of my forehead and just on my
neck slightly to finish off just on my
lips I'm using this lip gloss from soap
&amp;amp; Glory in the shade nude in town it has
kind of lip plumping qualities to it so
it saves me making my lips look bigger
with a lip liner so just trying to keep
products minimal and there's a really
gorgeous wearable color and that is the
finished look I really hope you guys
