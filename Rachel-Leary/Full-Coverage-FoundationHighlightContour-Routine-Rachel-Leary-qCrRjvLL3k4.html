today's video as you can see I have no
eye makeup on it's all just skin because
as you can tell by the title I'm gonna
be showing you a kind of full coverage
foundation highlighting and contouring
routine I do this is not everyday makeup
this is the makeup I would wear or
before I go out or something like that
when I want my skin to look the best
that I possibly can and kind of to
achieve that I wear more makeup than I
usually would on a day to day feel free
to kind of swap out products or whatever
use whatever product works best for you
I do give a few tips and advice
throughout this video and some kind of
cheaper alternatives I'm using a product
that might be slightly more expensive or
all the other way around if I'm using a
product that you can get from a futsal
Superdrug or a drugstore I give you a
high-end dupe for that too so hopefully
I'm accommodating for everyone I
understand this is a lot of makeup so
you don't need to tell me how i it's
just what makes me feel comfortable so
just do yeah so if you want to see how I
achieve my kind of full coverage
foundation routine then keep watching so
as you guys know before I do my
foundation I always do my eyebrows first
I don't know what it is I just prefer to
kind of draw my eyebrows on to clean
skin so to do that I used my Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow Wiz but the soap &amp;amp;
Glory brow archery pencil in hot
chocolate is basically like a chip for
this if you wanted a cheaper alternative
so if I know if I'm going on a night out
and I'm gonna be applying a lot of skin
makeup I always make sure to prep my
skin and take a time prepping my skin
because I feel like that's really
important and I feel you don't prep your
skin enough and the foundation is not
gonna look the best that you want it to
the first step I always do is moisturize
so as you guys saw for my skincare
routine I like to use the only two in
one moisturizer just to prep my skin I
feel like you shouldn't go too heavy
with moisturizer just because depending
on how heavy duty of moisturizer is this
one's quite lightweight so I can be
quite generous with it but the more
heavy duty your moisturizer is the more
products going to slip and slide around
your face so you almost want to apply
not too much that nothing's gonna sit on
top of it then as always again I like to
use my mac fix+ just to really hydrate
my skin a lot of people think that this
is like a primer and technically in this
case I am gonna be using it like a
primer but fix+ just kind of implies
that it's not gonna fix your makeup and
it's not a setting spray it's just kind
of like a hydrating mist so that's why I
use it before I put foundation on and
also why people apply it after they put
foundation on because once you put as a
powder and stuff in your face your face
can feel quite dry and this is just
gonna add moisture back into your face
and that's why it's called like a fixing
spray because it gets rid of the kind of
powdered effect that's why I like to use
it before and after my foundation I've
got kind of normal skin I don't really
need to have a primer as well so I'm
kind of using this as a primer a
hydrating primer I just kind of like to
speed up the process and just find my
face so my face really quickly so this
was a tip that I actually saw kyj and
his makeup artist use on her basically
taking a cream highlighter this is the
sleek beckus illuminator in Monaco so
it's kind of like a pearl color and
highlighter I've got one from NARS as
well the Copacabana one I think it's
called it's a kind of high-end Jeep so
this is the cheap alternative to that
one and just take a small pump of that
on the back of my hand and then with
just a synthetic foundation brush just
kind of applying it where you would
apply like a powder highlighter on top
of your foundation so this is just going
to give you that kind of strobing glow
from within underneath your skin
I can do an everyday foundation routine
so let me know in the comments if you
guys would like to see that one this is
like a full coverage that's why there's
gonna be a lot of products and a lot of
makeup I'm not using a huge amount of
each products I feel like layering in
small amounts but a good few products is
the way that I achieve my skin to look
the best for going out and what makes it
last the longest
so my two favorites are the giorgio
armani luminous silk foundation and the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD it's stick I
don't know what it is about the stick
formulation I just feel like it gives a
much better coverage than the fluid both
of them I prefer over the original
makeup from a HD foundation I think the
Ultra HD is a lot better these two are
my favorites I'm going to be using the
stick today as per usual my neck it's a
lot darker than my face so when I apply
this to my skin if you think a luxury
dark it is to kind of match I always
always always see comments on all my old
videos telling me that my foundations
way too dark but honestly I would look
so much more ridiculous if I I almost
look ridiculous now like if I had a
really pale face and at our neck it's
just because I exfoliate my face a lot
more so the tan comes off yeah so to
apply this I just do kind of two strokes
there two strokes there one two and I
think what it is about the stick
formulation I like a bit more is that
it's really nice free not apply too much
and a little goes a long way with this
foundation like you may think it's
honestly really thin thin on my face so
it just travels a long way which is why
I like it and I've used that so so much
and I've even and blend that in I either
use a foundation brush or a Beauty
Blender today I'm gonna be using a
foundation brush and the one I'm
literally in love with is the Tom Ford
cream foundation brush I know this is an
expensive foundation brush so I don't
expect you guys to have it or to use it
but if you if you're lucky enough to
have your hands in it you'll know it's
amazing
friend ambi uses for me on my prom
makeup and this in combination with
either of these two foundation is like a
match made in heaven I'm literally in
love with this brush it's the zero to
cream foundation brush from 12 board I'm
just gonna blend that into my skin kind
of using that circular buffing motion
even though this one doesn't have like a
flat top or anything like that
that's a crucial step moving on to
concealer I really really really loved
the Maybelline age rewind this is the
one that I used to conceal with not to
highlight mine's in the shade light so
it does a bit of highlighting but I'm
more use this which is the Velvet 59
palette and use this shade here to do
the highlighting so I lay it under my
eyes when I'm going out just going in
like a twisty way and then taking this
palette here this really small synthetic
foundation brush from crown just taking
that really pale shade and placing this
just under my eyes like so and then
taking a damp beauty blender to blend
this out I wouldn't recommend a brush if
you're going to be layering products
because what the best thing about a
beach Brenna is and why it's so popular
and everyone loves it is because it
absorbs excess product so it almost
doesn't let you apply too much and
that's why when you guys think I'm
applying way too much stuff on a cm real
life it's really thin on my face and I
don't feel caked because of this Beauty
Blender so
before applying any powder if you are
more of a powder contour person then go
ahead and powder your highlighted areas
now but I much prefer the appearance of
cream contours on the skin I think you
can blend it a lot more naturally the
colors a bit more natural so I'm gonna
go ahead and do that taking this palette
again from Velvet 59 and taking a
mixture between these two shades I know
that looks really dark but I'll soon
show you so to apply this I'm taking
there more feet g7 brush it's basically
a really tiny synthetic brush I'm just
taking minimal of each of these you kind
of want to go from the top of your air
down and not really any pasture eyebrow
or your eye not adding any excess
product just was left on the brush
my jawline as well and this was another
tip that I picked up from cardi Jenna's
makeup artists taking a light cream
bronzing products to blend that out so
the two that I have is the Chanel so
late and a Chanel and kind of drugstore
alternative which is basically exactly
the same is the bourgeois bronzing
primer I'm just going to be using the
Chanel one for the purpose of the fact I
have it and I want to use it so taking
again this crown brush which is
basically like the Mac 130 find a ssin
brush or something like that basically a
short stumpy do is buy the foundation
brush just swirling around and buffing
the product upwards you don't want to
drag it down because that's when your
face starts to sink you want to drag it
upwards
you
then this is an optional step I just
like to take my beauty blender from the
floor and use the kind of not pointy
side the rounded side and just press
everything into my skin and make sure
it's all that one layer and it's all
like any excess product has been
absorbed so I'm kind of got as minimal
product on my face as possible after
just applying lots of product if that
makes any sense so because that's all
the creams I'm using I'm now safe to
kind of set my face with all the powders
that I'm going to be using so for under
my eyes I'm going to be using the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade diffused light again my friend
amber introduced me to this when she did
my prom makeup and I just thought it was
the most gorgeous under eye setting
powder ever it brightens it gives you
that really like like the name like
diffused like finish and it just looks
so amazing but obviously an alternative
you could use is this translucent powder
from Nev from neve cosmetics and it says
translucent mineral powder bits in the
shade nude and this has the kind of same
exact coloring and finish as the
hourglass ambient lighting powder pretty
sure it's like half the price the
difference being it's just a loose
powder so just be careful if you do get
this cause loose powders are private
heavier if you're not careful so just
make sure to tap off the excess so to
apply this I'm using my Sigma tapered
highlighting brush this is like my
favorite brush ever for applying
anything under the eye the tapered top
just fits perfectly and your eyes and
yeah I just love it you can just see how
much it brightens up under the eye and
also in photos you don't get that
flashback and that's like the best thing
ever
I do switch up though between this and
the Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder just because the translucent
one's a lot better if you've got oily
skin and I don't have oily skin or
anything but sometimes
Matt look then I'll go for that one and
the rest of my face I'm just taking this
Rimmel remote clear complexion
translucent powder just because I don't
want to add any more coverage I just
kind of want to set everything that I've
placed down and I'm using the Sigma
tapered face brush to do this then to
kind of emphasize the contour that we've
made I'm gonna take my Mac give me some
bronzer on a zoeva luxe cheek finish
brush and basically just place that on
top of where we've put the cream product
basically just like how we set the
highlighter in place this is just gonna
set the Queen ones in place but I'm
gonna be quite sparingly with discs
obviously we've already bronzed and
stuff like that so I don't want to look
too
you
last but not least highlighting the
cheekbones I'm going to be taking this
Kiko eyeshadow in the number 208 which
is basically your classic Mac whispers
girl Laura Gallagher Laura Geller gilded
Laura Geller gilded honey Anastasia
Beverly Hills so Hollywood and it's like
a quarter of the price I would use this
and is this kind of like a trusty
highlighter that I know is always gonna
look really good so on a night out I
love using this one and to apply I'm
going to be using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills highlighting brush then the final
step I'm going to be taking my Mario
Badescu rose water spray just to set
everything in place yeah that is
everything that I do in terms of skin
wise before I'm gonna night out in terms
of my full coverage foundation highlight
and contour routine so give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and want to
see kind of more routine type videos or
like an everyday foundation routine or
something like that I'm gonna be doing a
bit of pre filming for when I go to
America it's only for a few days but the
few days I'm away would be the few days
that I would upload anyway so I need
some ideas for then make sure to follow
