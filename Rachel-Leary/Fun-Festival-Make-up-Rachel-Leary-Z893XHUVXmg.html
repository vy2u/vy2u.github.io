today i am bringing you this a blue
glitter liner look which i thought would
be really fun for like a festival makeup
so let's go ahead and get started as
always i'm starting off by priming my
eye using my Mac soft ochre paint ball
just using a synthetic brush to push
this all over my lid and then I'm going
to be setting it in place with a just
like a skin colored powder and I'm using
my Mac and c20 studio fix powder to do
this
then my eyebrows i'm using my anastasia
dipbrow in chocolate to highlight my
inner corner i'm using the whimsical
foiled eyeshadow from makeup geek this
is basically just a really iridescent
violet shade just wanted to kind of
stick with the cool tone and glittery
theme of the liner but you can just use
whatever you want to do this to
highlight my brow bone I'm just using a
matte kind of vanilla shade and this is
Blanc type by mark
I'm keeping the crease fairly basic so
I'm just using peach maybe by makeup
geek and just using once we my
promotions to blend that into the crease
I'm then using purely naked by makeup
geek which is just a slightly darker
just to further deepen it and then
that's literally it
I'm then taking this runway eyes
eyeshadow by Milani in the shade beach
sand which is just a really really pale
gold color I'm just placing that all
over my lid as just something really
subtle because I don't want to draw
attention away from the liner so for the
line art I'm using that Anastasia
waterproof cream color in ocean which is
just a really pale blue shade you can
use anything to do this you can use just
any colored liquid liner it's just to
give a base to the glitter you can even
Mick Mick you can even mix fix+ by mac
with any kind of eyeshadow that you want
to and then that kind of creates a
consistency that you can make it liner
with the glitters I chose to use with a
3d pale mint and the reflex transparent
teal by fine Mac you can literally go to
boots and get whatever glitter you want
or superdrug get whatever you want or if
you can get your hands on these I really
recommend them that they are gorgeous
and I'm just placing downton on eyelash
glue on top of the liner with in it
earbud and then just pressing the
glitter on the top starting with the 3d
mint get ur then putting the transparent
tail over the top and then cleaning up
with a wipe
then I'm just applying a small coat of
mascara before falsies this is the mac
extended play like I always sing the
praises of this mascara I love it so
much it's amazing it just separating and
lengthening your lashes lashes i went
for with the house of lashes iconics
just because they win out slightly and
they just add a little bit of drama to
the look now on to the face i'm priming
my skin using my Mac prep and prime skin
base massage as a primer I'd already
moisturized prior to this video a
flawless finish i'm using my makeup
further HD foundation in the shade and
127 it is slightly two more times than
my face but it matches my neck perfectly
and i'm just stuffing that in with a
real techniques multitask face brush i'm
really liking this brush at the moment
for blending in foundation it just gives
me a really nice coverage and gets it
done super quick I'm then taking my
L'Oreal age rewind concealer i recently
picked this up and I'm loving it as an
under-eye concealer it's the perfect
color it's not too light for
highlighting even though I did get the
lighter shade
going back in with my mac studio fix
powder in NC 20 I'm just setting my
under eyes with a sigma take tapered
high load to brush all the links to
where I get my brushes from are down
below if you wanted to get any for
yourself for bronzer I'm taking the
better shimmering skin Perfector in the
shade topaz this is basically a really
gorgeous bronze highlighting shade and
I'm loving this at the moment just as
bronzer on its own just because it's got
such a gorgeous color payoff and it's
definitely too dark for me to be a
highlighter if you have slightly darker
skins would look absolutely stunning as
well as a hunt as using it for a
highlighter but I'm just using it as a
blunder and then I'm going in with Mac
soft and gentle just on the tops of my
cheeks just for an extra glow
to finish off my eyes on taking cocoa
bear by makeup peak which is just a
slightly darker brown than the ones
we've been using just add a bit of depth
and dimension to the eye but it's just
going to make the blue in my eyes really
pop then just applying blood and rash
mascara and the eyes are complete since
it's festival inspired you don't really
want to be faffing about with lip
products all the time so I'm just taking
the dazzleglass in sugar round by map
which is just a really sparkly nude
floss and then for something a bit
different I'm going to press some of
that reflex teal just into the center of
my lid lid lip and that's the finished
look I really hope you guys liked it
something a bit different for the
festival season I'm planning to film a
festival hair and kind of jewelry makeup
video soon so stay tuned for that one
let me know if you guys to recreate this
look as well by tagging me on twitter
and instagram the links to that will be
at the end of this video but yeah until
next time guys see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
