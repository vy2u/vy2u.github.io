right now because without further ado
we're gonna go from this to a list as
you can see so we're gonna be looking a
little bit different we're getting glam
to go out so let's just have a good time
and get started
7-yard Blanc right so chip again we're
gonna be I'm not actually you know I'm
not really gonna go into every part that
I'm using because I'm just gonna kind of
chat with you guys and get ready while
I'm doing this so I'm going to leave
everything it listed down below if
you're liking the look of something on
each step I will have named it and
linked it down below if you want to get
it you might be able to see products I'm
using anyway while I apply them but oh
my god guys I cannot stop listening to
the new car DB album it is so good if
you guys have been listening to it too
or you guys love it let me know your
favorite songs in the comment section
down below I've been loving as you can
tell by the intro maybe I've been loving
I liked it I loved rip I love ring I
love I do I love bacon head is that what
it's called I let you like I love them
all there's not one song that like I
don't like which is really rare and out
in the owning the last time that
happened was on it might be like
scissors album or um Drake's album the
weekends new like EP album vibe thing I
like all of the songs on their tune I
wish there was a way for me to like have
my music on in the background while I'm
doing this but because obviously there's
like adverts in this video and stuff I
can you know like make money off of
music we're just gonna I already
understand how it yeah yeah and this
looks really dark it's because it is and
that's how I like it
yeah if you can't tell basically my
towns actually really dark sorry it's
just gonna match up with my tan if
that's alright
and all you trolls can move along nicely
did you guys actually prefer it when I
don't know if you noticed maybe you
didn't even know just me saying what
brushes I use do you guys prefer it when
I do that or not I always mix up with my
brushes I don't know if you guys want me
to tell you what brushes I'm using or
just go ahead
and you know not tell you I've actually
always wanted to do like get ready with
me like this for a long time I actually
really want to do like Instagram life's
what I'm getting ready but apparently
I've never I've never done an Instagram
live before so give this video a thumbs
up if you think I should like before I
go out or anything like that cuz I
always get scared either like one
no one's gonna watch it I don't know
when's a good time to do Instagram
nights or anything and you can get some
real trolls going on just sometimes they
might promote your as Graham live on for
someone funds almost page that you know
you don't they don't even follow you so
like of seeing if they post nasty stuff
then you know I'm just not good at that
like oh you can read my face if
something's like upset me I can't hide
her and so if I was like sat there with
like all these Instagram live comments
like coming through and I was getting
mean ones I probably just turned the
whole thing off because nobody wants to
sit there just well people are obviously
sat there watching you and just think
I'm gonna let her know that she is a fat
ugly bitch you know what I'm saying so
they scare me but let me know if you
would want me to drew one and I can just
only let you know like you guys know cuz
you guys don't give me any more like
don't give me much crap sorry I let
Gallagher alrighty I'm liking the way
this looks tonight I'm gonna go with a
slightly brighter color concealer that I
usually word cuz I fought him back into
the trap of liking a brighter and dr c
sue me so today was fun i actually went
to the samson hotel and had a like
intimate breakfast with royal atwood
with nip and fir and makeup Oh Mario I
think he's one of their ambassadors so
he came and hosted I'm surprised that he
even did that hasn't he just been
everywhere recently like obviously he
had his big launch with Kim which
probably took up a lot of his time he
then had his own master class which
looked amazing and then he's hosting you
know another kind of mini masterclass
I'm sure he's doing like so much in
between us so I'm so glad I got to see
him and it was actually funny he follows
me on Instagram because
ages ago I did a thorough Kardashian
inspired look that he had done on Chloe
I did like a side by side image and I
think maybe it got a bit of popularity
because I think I might have hashtagged
him or something and you know on every
hashtag there's like the top posts so I
think I'm guessing that's how he saw it
I don't know but he saw it regardless
commented and then followed me after
that so we were we were sat in the you
know the room and he was about to start
answering questions so he other super
funny so he finally turned around to
kind of face everyone and be like anyone
got any questions and then he clocked me
and I got it oh and then he clocked me
in the audience and said okay I follow
you and I was just there like literally
I wanted to start screaming I think I
reacted kind of badly I just kind of sat
there and went like I don't want to be
like yeah you do like a jack every
second they're young and unfollowed me
aren't ready but you know I mean I
didn't want to like not click cool so I
just kind of sat down like you know but
yeah that was a cool moment a cool
morning we love a cream one for one
let's get blending I'm already going
weird and I think it's the seven Yong
dong what do we want powder when do we
want it now where is it
okay now I've powdered my face I'm gonna
go ahead and do my eyebrows off camera
because it like a Jackson Hale just said
in her most recent video nobody actually
likes to sit and watch people do that
eyebrows unless you're specifically
searching your name and eyebrow routine
and you want to learn because everyone
has their own way everyone's seen how to
do eyes before and so I am I'm going
home and do that then we'll be back okay
we are back brows a done pop corners
topped up my glass is not however but
you know I'm gonna finish that yeah okay
okay so tonight I'm actually going out
for drinks and like nibbles
say I'm so excited going to really like
a lush place oh I don't know like what I
don't want to be you know too too bland
but then you definitely can't dress down
I just got shipped in my brow if you
guys are watching this video at the
weekend or something and you're going
out or you're going out tonight let me
know in the comment section down below
where you're going what you're doing how
drunk are you
time for a little bit of blush a blush
moment I've got to stop with that I bet
you I'm gonna get so many comments that
girl ain't gonna be night clinic on a
can or on cardi beanie or whether I
actually can't stop sometimes it just
works if someone just says something
you're like oh time to glory
oh yeah we can pile it on so do and
we'll say I'm loving this brush this is
the luxe powder fusion a brush by zoeva
so ever so either how do you guys say it
I always let you like go back and with
everything I've done prior before I move
on to the next step just to make sure
everything's all buffed and blend it in
together but I think that's pretty much
the face run
so now let's zoom you in a little bit
and we'll do our eyes I'm feeling like
at a minimum glittery the lamb non-sena
see that stuff okay so the palette I'm
using is the morphe 35o 2 palette just
for reference basically just a matte
warm palette you guys know this is
honestly like go to look for me if I'm
just going out for kind of maybe like
dinner and drinks kind of vibe and I'm
going more like club' I tend to get like
more compliments when my eyes are a
little darker I think that's just cause
my icon is quite light it just makes
that really gonna stand out and pop get
the boys attention you know
yeah so just going in with some warm
crease curls what you guys prefer to do
these days when you're going out I love
just like someone
with my friends some nice food good
company but then there's another part of
me that loves to get like absolutely
wrecked in a bar and a club that bad
thing I think as I get older and then
more times I do go out and get
absolutely wrecked I do think like oh my
god I'm getting a little bit too old for
this
yeah I lose after seeing you guys when
I'm out it's like the funniest thing
I'll be just like blind drunk and so
were you and it'll be loud wow it's you
and I'll be like yeah and I always dread
if I know I've had like pictures with
you guys when I've been in like a cloud
I'm hot I've no idea what my face looks
like or anything but the next day when
it's not been tagged in a photo I'm like
oh my god oh my god oh my god this is it
but honestly I always have the best time
with you guys when I see you wherever I
am and if we both happen to be
completely drunk it's even better that
colour I've just applied us actually I
think as dark because they want to go
right now but yeah I prefer I kind of
like softer I've I'm just going dinner
and drinks vibes obviously I can't stop
with pop one but such a good snack
hashtag not spawn for quick glam looks I
love this this is the Stila magnificent
metal shadow in pitten karma it's so
pigmented so really like cut you up a
new crease pretty right I love this one
and rose gold retro I think that's so
pretty and these just make everything
like so quick and easy to do how quick
was that I'm just gonna go back in with
a little bit of a warm color to diffuse
it together so there's no nori nori
harsh lines oh by the way guys when I
asked you on like Twitter if I should do
this video you know what I put for the
no option it's pronounced nori like me
and my friend say all the time I don't
know where it came from how it started I
think it's meant to be like an Austrian
like a really over-pronounce Australian
way of saying no but we're going like
noir if I'm going to set that in a video
before but maybe I need to do like a
video with my friends again maybe all of
us like getting liddie I'm just gonna do
the damn thing and connect it other see
you don't you think that makes just such
difference in terms of like eye color
making these bitches pop let's get it it
back but okay mrs. blue eyes what are
you sayin so dope right let me highlight
my inner corner you're going to use my
highlighter again on my little brush
that I used in my previous videos that
doo doo doo doo you know I'm just gonna
put something in the water line today
this is the power surge eye Kohl from
necklace mix oh yeah I mean look at in
there and do this this is just like a
very soft gold you see you deserve
nothing nothing at too heavy that's
gonna really shut my eyes down so now
gonna go ahead and apply mascara and
lashes I'll tell you what lashes they
are once they're on and they've me back
to do the lips and finish up so these
are the eyes with lashes on I love can
you tell these are unicorn lashes in the
style peachy pie I think but now we're
gonna take one final drink of the drink
because it's time for lips so you're on
the same stage gluggy glass oh okay
let's move on to the lips you guys know
I love a nude especially if I'm going
out for me this is a little a little too
much going on in the eye to do like a
bold color plus I think I'm gonna be
eating and drinking so we don't want
anything too high-maintenance oh I'm
liking this pen so I don't use this in a
while this is Jane Eyre Adele spice
oh good baby baby now let's use this is
a little mini huda beauty liquid let's
do it
I love the smell of these bees smell so
good
okay eat it that's a nice nude I
normally go for something a little bit
lighter but loads of you guys always
call me out on that so I thought you
guys might prefer this one oh pretty
pretty pretty but I am gonna go over the
gloss this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory at sexy
at mother pucker gloss in a candy queen
and I just kind of wanted this to make
my lips look a little bit fuller and
kind of lighten it up a little it's not
gonna do that
as in lightening huh oh I like that
combo I've left the links all of that
down below if you guys are feeling it
too okay and the final step is to set
everything in place I have been loving
this I'm not even joking I got these and
everyone was using this on Instagram
like on their body I try it on my face
because you know I'm a daredevil and why
not
and I love it the color doesn't really
pay off so much on your face it just
gives you the most gorgeous glow it so
I'm gonna go ahead and prep set and glow
oh sorry I did it again Denine they
smell really good too and just quickly
while my face is still a little bit wet
going back in with my highlighter just
on the tops and we are complete and my
glass is okay so I hope you guys enjoyed
this kind of a get ready with me a style
video is probably actually one of the
most relaxed videos I've ever done
meeting I'm drinking some when water
looks good so if you like this style

out tonight stay sleep if you're not old
