hey you guys welcome back to my channel
so today we are doing a kind of a proper
makeup look I would say it's a little
bit bolder than usual it's basically
just a glance book makeup tutorial as
you guys can see it by the title and the
look that I'm wearing right now and
what's amazing about this tutorials
every single products I'm using is ten
pounds and under so it's super super
football like I said if you're doing
your own prom makeup this year then if
this is a great guide so you don't break
the bank
and you still look loners if I do this
still must say this makeups particularly
good also if you have maybe like a white
dress or a red dress or a black dress
because just adding a little pop of
color is a little different spin on a
prom makeup look then you're kind of
classic nude lip look so I already did
one of them which I've links down below
it is another DIY prom and hair makeup
tutorial a lot more neutral colors so
you can check that out down below as
well before we get started on this super
affordable a glam a prom makeup tutorial
it is time for our notification Belle's
shout out which this week goes to Eliza
fear that says you always say that you
have no idea yet what kind of look you
want to do in the end you kill it every
single time hashtag notification bell on
thank you a so much Eliza or ELISA I
think I said that right I always love
doing through your old comments whether
it's old videos new videos whatever just
to see who is constantly coming in
through the notification down and giving
you some love further ado if you would
like to see how we do this makeup
tutorial by the way this one is a
voiceover just because I thought I'd mix
it up I haven't done a voiceover walk
feels like forever and sometimes some
people prefer them to listen that long
to but I promise I've made it fun and
easy to listen to so I really hope you
guys enjoy this tutorial make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you do save some
coin all the links to everything are
down below let's go
okay so to begin we're gonna stop their
face and we're gonna be using one of my
favorite drugstore primers this is the
maybelline superstay primer let a little
bit literally does exactly what it says
in this tin and makes my makeup stay all
day it's kind of got that milky
consistency which I'm obsessed with and
a full foundation yes looking a very
tanned but look at my body I'm fairly
tanned this is the revolution at fast
base foundation stick only four pounds
or five pounds it's one of the other and
it's literally one of my favorite
foundations ever and I've been reaching
for this so much recently again this
from revolution this is their Pro HD
concealer palette I'm going to be taking
a few of the light shades and a few of
the dark sage to a cream contour and
highlight I feel like this is what
celebrity makeup artists use when they
do clients and all I see in the caption
is we used cream contour and
highlighting products I feel like they
use a palette like this and mix and
match all the different shades to get
their custom color and I feel like it
just looks the best and the most natural
so that's what I'm gonna be doing today
and when it's ultra Graham looks graham
ultra glam looks for the gram I think
that's what I was thinking in my head I
feel like you want a cream at contour I
feel like it just mean warms up your
face so much and this oh my god this is
one of my favourite powders ever again
from revolution it is their loose kind
of translucent powder in the color lace
has a slightly pink undertone to it but
it doesn't really translate like that on
the skin oh my god look it literally it
makes me feel and look airbrushed
I'm obsessed brow time you know the
drill do the brows the way that you do
this is the revolution at brow pomade
moving on to a contour I've been loving
this again this is from NYX it's like
they're three step to contour I think
this is in the shade medium and I'm just
gonna be using the NYX version of that
NARS
ito brush if you will to up contour and
for blush again one of my favorite
blushes as well all of my favourite
products seem to be from the drugstore
this is the lives of peach blusher from
L'Oreal it smells amazing looks amazing
and really it complements this skin
because it's like a peachy undertone and
this I did a video with revolution on
this I'm obsessed that like the Kim
Kardashian highlighting quads right now
but like a fraction of the price
this is the face quad and ignite just
taking the warm bronzer
shade and then at 4:00 liquid
highlighter taking the Loreal at Mon and
more drops you guys know I love putting
a cream highlighter down at before my
powder highlighter I feel like it just
pops it lasts so much longer and then
just looks so much more glam so I'm just
going to be placing a few drops on at
the tops of my cheekbones and buffing it
in with my blank canvas cosmetics brush
you guys know and then from the same
palette taking it via pale gold shade
three two one BAM literally obsessed
with this combo and it's so affordable
as well oh my god everyone is shaking
now let's move on it to the eyes this is
one of my favorite palettes oh my god it
is the South Revolution palette the
original one again obsessed with her
second one if you've not seen it yet you
better go and check it the colors are in
sane but just taking a really light
beige shade as our initial transition
color buffing it into the crease then it
taking this shade here it's like a
desert sand color
literally I love these colors for soft
glam looks they're so like if they're
not too intense it's like a warm orange
it's almost like a yellowy orange and
there's some of my favorite colors to
wear on the eyes so just buffing that in
it to further deepen you guys know the
drill just going deeper and deeper with
the shades of your choice I obviously
prefer a warmer tone especially with
soft glam lips I think it's the most
complimentary on anyone and just going
back in with my previous brushes too it
kind of blend it out but I'm just gonna
take a kind of more defined fluffy
precise brush to kind of almost create a
cut crease appearance but a very very
soft one as you can see I'm going back
doing my brush to blend it out so it's
not so harsh because we're going to be
using concealer as you can see from the
same palette that we used before to
carve out the crease but we're only
doing like a half cup crease that make
sense
you can go the full monty if you want
but as you can see I have left summit
shadow at the end and then just taking
it the white gold shimmery shade from
the palette or over basically where we
put the concealer and then we're gonna
blend that color into the crease colors
with another shimmery shade I love doing
this I don't even think that it just
looks so much more natural literally
look when I open my eyes
three two one look at the blend
literally I think it looks so much
better but then going back in with aid
alka bran and that same kind of precise
fluffy brush just to kind of really
enhance that appearance of the cut
crease but again we want to keep it
really soft we don't want anything too
too harsh this is my fave step I got
these glitters from beautybay but
they're still so affordable under 10
pounds I've got a white gold color which
I'm putting all over the top of the or
white gold eyeshadow and then a gold
color that I'm putting on top of the
gold and again that just creates that
transition and that blend the added pop
of spark or perfect for prom and any
glam looks and really kind of enhances
the cut crease appearance highlighting
the inner corner with the matte white
shade and then again running that
amazing like vomit desert sand yellow
orange color underneath the eye for a
really soft appearance see I'm obsessed
I think it just looks so nice and then I
wanted to add a winged liner to this
look and I'm using the NYX epic black
liquid eyeliner pen to do so to get that
precision and it really is epically
black it's like one of the blackest
eyeliners I've used and I love using a
pen I think there's so much easier to
create that precision without having to
feel like I need to do my eyes first
because obviously as you know I did my
face first so there's no you no room for
error
so just applying up mascara and lashes
these are the daydreamer lashes from
morphe so wispy I did have to custom cut
than the fit look I think they just look
so nice they don't hide any of the eye
makeup which I prefer and finally for
the lips I wanted to do red today I love
red it's my favorite bright bold color
this is the morphe matte lipstick in the
shade
lever I've left it linked down below on
the you @ks site if you're interested
again soft portable but then to tidy up
I'm taking the NYX matte suede lip liner
in a kitten heels I think just to kind
of even up my lips as you can see my
lips are kind of uneven and I can't
always get that precision with the
lipsticks but don't we are done this is
the finished glam look
I'm obsessed so that was the end of the
tutorial
I really hope you guys enjoyed it so
many a bomber products so affordable if
this doesn't as I was saying this
doesn't just have to be for prom
obviously I just thought it would be a
kind of different spin on a prom
make up look I know if you're wearing a
red dress or whatever sometimes you need
to know what kind of makeup to go for so
this would be a good idea if you like
the look of this a makeup look then
definitely make sure to give it a thumbs
up but before you leave subscribe if you
haven't already so you can join the
family and see us all in the next video
