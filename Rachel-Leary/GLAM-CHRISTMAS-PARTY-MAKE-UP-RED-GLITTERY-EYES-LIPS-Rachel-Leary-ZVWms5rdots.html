today we are doing a Christmas party
makeup look I kind of wanted to stick
with the red theme because one red is my
favorite color and two I always
associate the kind of red with Christmas
and the holidays and all that good stuff
I am honestly obsessed with the way this
came out I'm obsessed with the skin I'm
obsessed with the eyes I used a bunch of
my favorite products this is a lot of
makeup in this tutorial is a full
coverage band like or not wearing a lot
of makeup mix that lasts a lot longer I
feel like it looks the best in pictures
and is more durable throughout the day
so perfect for the party seasons so it's
if you don't like a lot of makeup you're
probably not gonna like this tutorial I
decided to go for like a pinky red
glittery kind of rounded blown-out
smokey eye a red lip really full
coverage dewy glowy skin oh my god baby
I'm so excited if you guys to see this
tutorial because I love the way that it
came out if you like the look of this
look already then make sure to give it a
thumbs up and hit that subscribe button
for more videos in the future but
without further ado we're gonna go ahead
and get started on this look again we
are gonna do our skin and we're taking
dogs isn't it Casali unicorn essence the
serum and just rub that into our skin I
love this one it smells incredible and -
it gives a really hydrating at glowy at
face underneath our makeup and then I
realized these chunky hoops were getting
in the mate so I took them off and then
a new product from Kiko this is called
their strobing serum it's a little bit
more tacky than a moisturizer but really
really feels amazing on the skin and
gives a gorgeous glow can you tell we're
going for glowy skin today and then for
primer I'm taking the a Marc Jacobs
coconut primer I believe this is called
and just buffing that into the skin with
my Real Techniques a multitasker face
brush as always this is one of my
favorite primers it's a super hydrating
and leaves it really and subtle talk to
the skin and this on top of all the
other products is a winner and the
foundation I'm taking one of my old
faves this is the Too Faced Born This
Way a foundation in the shade sand and I
only like this foundation if I apply it
with eight damp Beauty Blender so I go
ahead and do that and then for concealer
we're gonna be extra and again an old
favourite is the Mac Pro Longwear I'm
mixing the two it shades n:w 35 and nw20
for extra coverage and the nw20 is just
for the extra
the NW 35 was pretty close to my skin
tone so that just helps gonna cancel out
any dark under-eye circles and for cream
contour I am taking another favorite
this is the aroma duo at contour stick
in the shade dark and I'm just applying
that around the perimeters of my face
and along with my jawline and down my
chin I'm just buffing that in with a duo
fiber face brush I feel this has like
the nicest color and it blends so easily
into the skin which is why it's my
favorite and plus it's from the minerals
so it's a super super upwards or so
you've never tried this I definitely
recommend our it kind of reminds me of
the Kim kardashian-west beauty contest
it's again this is another new favorite
this is the beauty at bakery translucent
powder I've been loving this it really
really brightens up underneath my eyes
so I'm gonna go ahead and fake under
there and just kind of set the rest of
my face and like the contour and all
that good stuff
I'm now gonna do my brows using it the
Beverly anastasia beverly hills dipbrow
in medium brown and these sigma brow
powder in medium and just said it with
my benefit gimme brow and then i can
just wipe all the powder away and we can
move back onto the face and contouring
again this is the balm Bahama Mama
bronzer it's quite a cool tone bronzer
so I'm quite comfortable to you at
contour my cheeks and my nose with it
always make sure to dab out your nose
contour so it's not too too harsh and
then to warm up the skin I'm taking the
Too Faced of dark chocolate Soleil
bronzer and just dusting that around all
the places that are kind of contoured
but a little bit higher and this blusher
is so nice it's from a brand called
protocol but I'd never heard of before
and it's they're like illuminated
apricot swirl oh my god the most
gorgeous glow ever defo check them out
and for a bronzed glow oops don't do
that this is the a boutique bakery
illuminator in it froze or frozen or
something I'm obsessed you guys know I
love a shimmery bronzer and that's why
I'm bathing in it and applying it all
over at my body and now at 4 and liquid
illuminator this is a via Beauty pie
it's strobing drops and I love this
product in literally it blends like
butter into the skin this most gorgeous
base foot of powder harder as you can
see and it's so subtle but like so not
suffer at the same time which is kind of
what we won and the highlighter an old
favor again this is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills highlighter in it so
Hollywood get ready for the pop in 3 2 1
Oh
and I'm just gonna be applying that on
my nose and on my lips and just
everywhere because I wanted to be a
beaming today because it's Christmas
y'all now I'm moving on to the eyes this
is the morphia to create palette I love
this and taking this a big warm initial
transition color into the crease on a
big fluffy brush to a big kin with and
we asked to give it the red theme so all
the kind of undertones of this will be
very warm so again it taking this a map
kind of burn oranjee red brick color and
I love this multi brush - oh my god
applying that further into the crease
and then just going back in with the big
fluffy brush and then it taking this
more popular shade again just further
deepening up the crease you guys know
the drill we are gonna be kind of
cutting out the crease so you don't want
to take it too high you can you take it
onto the lid that's not so much a
problem because we're going to be
cutting it out anyway and then we are
moving on to a dark brown I'm not really
using a black in this tutorial I wanted
to keep it quite warm and easily to a
blend so again I'm just applying that
further into the crease and going back
in with my previous brushes to soften it
out
now I'm taking this a color pop
supernova liquid eyeshadow on my goddess
one of the red shades I left the name of
it and it linked down below and again
using this to cut out the crease or what
Maggard an obsessed with this color and
taking this amazing kind of satin red
shade from the same multi palette I'm
using that to kind of create a secondary
transition across the lid and add like a
bit pop of color which I am obsessive
I'm yet to use that red so so it starts
to use it and then just making sure it's
all blend together by going back in with
the previous brushes now so glitter I'm
taking two shades of the Urban Decay
heavy metal glitters eyeliner I love
these eyeliners as like a an eyeshadow
topper as you guys know I've left the
names of these two down below but going
in with the darkest one first and then
the lightest one on top for that extra
which is out and now I'm just
highlighting my inner corner and then I
kind of wanted to give the lash line a
little bit of something more so just
going in with this dark purple a brownie
black shade just pressing that I'm
really close to my upper lash line and
then to finish off the eye taking that
warm up brick shade just running that
along a lower weight running that on a
pencil brush on at my lower lash line
and connecting it back up into the
crease just to tie everything together
and now for the waterline I'm taking it
this eyeliner from
decay is in the color roach I've left it
linked down below I love a warmer golden
brown in the walls fine oh my god and
now we can do mascara and lashes these
are my favorite lashes at the moment
they're from unicorn lashes in the style
lemon meringue so fluttery and natural I
am obsessed moving on to lips this is
the most gorgeous Christmas red this is
the matching at lip pencil and that
lipstick from the Maybelline and Gigi
Hadid collection in the shade Austen oh
my god I think it just goes so so so
well with the eye makeup and because
obviously but I makeup is a statement in
itself feel free if you're not feeling
too adventurous to pair it with a nude
because I know that was me I would
probably do that but that is the
finished makeup look so that was the
