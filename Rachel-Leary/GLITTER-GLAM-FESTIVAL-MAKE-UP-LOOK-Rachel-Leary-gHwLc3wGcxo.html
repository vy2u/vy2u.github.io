as you can see a super wearable everyday
makeup look today I'm just kidding today
we're going to be doing a fast or
possibly many festival inspired looks
it's just been Coachella festival season
is coming so I thought I would kick it
off with this kind of glittery at the
lam festival makeup look you've got
glitter we've got gems we've got all
sorts going on so I really hope you guys
enjoy it if you like the look of it so

down below when you do so you can be in
for a shout out and this week's post
notification at ballot shout out goes to
nicole prothero that says notification
bell on as per love yeah thank you so
much I love you too but yes without
further ado if you'd like to see how to
get this a festival Guillory a glamour
and makeup look then please keep
watching
okay so we're gonna start off with our
skin already done because I literally
just did like a bronzy at summer skin
tutorial I feel like it just would get a
little bit repetitive because I
basically did a very similar skin
routine so if you want to see that I
have left it linked down below in the
description and also the island that
we're doing I feel quite confident doing
it with my eyes kind of already done
there's not gonna be any loose glitters
on my eyes it's all kind of like glitter
liners and stuff so we're gonna go ahead
and just move straight on to the eye
makeup okay so for this eye look we're
going to be using the BH Cosmetics
weekend festival eyeshadow palette
literally look at it is absolutely a
gorgeous and when I got this so many of
you asked me to use in a tutorial so
this only it seemed like the perfect
tutorial to try and trust it in so we're
gonna try and use like as many of the
colors as possible so we're gonna start
off with this shade right here as our
initial transition color we're gonna be
kind of applying this quite heavily this
color actually really goes with the top
I'm wearing right now but all I got a
look at the pigment in this like this is
no joke when it comes to cut creases and
stuff you really want to apply each
color quite heavily because you don't
want it to you know get lost in the
transition so taking it up kind of quite
high all the way from inner to outer
corner as well as definitely you know an
important step in ordering in making
sure that the color stays visible so
just packing it on like so then I'm just
gonna be taking this deeper brick color
and going ahead and placing this
directly underneath you can see this
kind of blocks out some of the color but
it creates that really nice transition
on the lid we don't want it to go too
far out because we are going to be doing
a wing if you're not comfortable with
doing your skin first then definitely do
this first and then go ahead and watch
my skin tutorial or just go ahead and do
a skin how you normally would afterwards
if you feel not confident going in with
the liquid eyeliner and feel like you
may need to clean it up but once
obviously we've applied that color I'm
just going back in with my previous
brush and just softening and diffusing
that out I'm now going in with this dark
brown shade here and also a bit of the
purple swag shade on
the brush that actually it came with the
collection this is the BH Cosmetics
brush number eight and just really
precisely drawing into my crease I'm
literally just drawing a line almost
from inner to outer corner you can see
creating that crease and defining it
like so I'm not gonna really blend that
out too much but just taking mine the
brush that I applied the initial hippie
orange shade with just lightly not
picking up any other additional product
just helping to blend that out so now
I'm gonna go ahead and take my concealer
and this is the revolution concealing to
find concealer and I'm just gonna use
this as the product to carve out my
crease with you guys have seen me doing
this a hundred times I'll just quickly
show you just applying it directly I'm
not gonna take it too far out but I just
like to apply it in the middle and then
look up and then back down and it just
kind of gives me a rough guide as to how
high I should take it so it's not going
too high but then we want it to be
visible so we don't want it to be too
low either doing this also just allows
like you know when you apply your
shadows to the top they've got something
nice to cling to and they should stand
out a little brighter you can use
anything for this I really like the
Urban Decay Eden primer potion or they
actually have a white one but you'd
probably be really good for this
anything up like an opaque flesh tone
would work really really well and like I
said you just kind of want to stop just
kind of before the end so you'll be able
to create that winged out shape and then
you can see we've still got the cut
crease go we're known but you can always
like you know go back in and add to it
if you've lost some of the colors
slightly but now this is for the fun
part you can go in with whatever colors
you want across the lid I'm feeling like
a yellowy green vibe because we're going
with like blue underneath so I got the
blue and the green to tie in together so
I'm just gonna be taking it this shade
here it's the yellow shade called
euphoria and just applying that on the
inner most part of my eye oh my God look
at that pigment light
as a joke and just tapping it on kind of
halfway across because then we want the
green to kind of be the other class and
the I but I'm also gonna be going in
with a bit later on the innermost part
which is only gonna be going on the
innermost part is that make sense so I
want the yellow to kind of almost be in
the middle and then also be like a base
color for the glitter if that makes any
sense and now I'm going in with this
neon color and just packing that on the
end making sure to kind of drag it when
you're blending the two colors together
I'm just kind of going over where the
concealer is so that kind of gives you a
like a base as to when to stop with the
product like so I'm now gonna highlight
my inner corner with this color here
this is the color of spirit it's like an
iridescent purple I thought it would
really complement the yellow on the eye
and also just a little bit different you
know let's just be adventurous so go on
as much as you want with this I feel
like in a corner highlights at festivals
always pop in and now I'm just gonna
take this I'll lose a shade which is the
most gorgeous like teal color and just
run that underneath my eye like so and
that's going to really connect nicely up
with the green I'm not gonna take it too
low because we are gonna be at blending
it out I'm gonna be taking the shimmer
color called ultimate which is basically
the shimmery version of that teal color
I'm going to use that to buff it out so
connecting it up to the inner corner so
the shimmery colors can meet and also
just kind of like dragging it down
slightly in a triangular motion
underneath the eye
first of all vibes you know I'm gonna go
in with the Marc Jacobs high liner in
the color whirlpool just to kind of line
my waterline and it's gonna really kind
of blend in our water line to that lower
lash line color they're literally
exactly the same it's like the best
thing ever
now before we go in with liquid eyeliner
it's time for Dylan at a time so first
of all I'm going to be taking the heavy
metal
glitter liner these are from Urban Decay
all of them are by the way this is in
the color pyro it's actually kind of
like a click it just has kind of reflex
of purples greens and blues in it and
I'm just going to go over our inner
corner highlight with this color just to
add a bit of sparkle and glitter you can
take it kind of on the lower lash line
as well that's why I love about first of
all a makeup is that you can let you
just do whatever and just call it first
of all makeup and you've just kind of
just dunked your whole head in a pile of
glitter but now this is literally my
favorite one ever this I can use on like
an everyday basis because the color is
so gorge
this is the midnight cowgirl glitter and
I'm just going to be using that on the
kind of look in a third of our eyes are
connecting the in a corner glitter to
something on the lid and also just kind
of creating a new kind of color so we're
covering up the yellow slightly just
kind of creating that transition over
the lid like so god I'm obsessed with
this and the final one we are going to
be taking by the way if you don't have
two eyeliners you could just be doing
this with a loose glitter I just feel
like these are a little bit less you
know pigmented and they don't cover up
what we've already done but they add
like a colorful sparkle you know what
I'm saying honestly so I'm gonna take
this one this is in gamma-ray it's a
good gorgeous teal blue color so I
wonder where we're gonna be picking yeah
I'm just gonna put that kind of
connecting on the lower lash line like
so now all that's left to do is just a
liquid liner wing and apply lashes and
at the liquid liner that I'm going to
use is the NYC black liquid liner this
is like and the lashes that we're going
to be using are these lashes these are
the tatty lashes in okay so to continue
on with the face I'm not a massive fan
of those holographic highlighters like
like blues or greens or anything really
like that but I do kind of want to bring
out some of the colors so I thought I
would use it the efendi beauty at
kilowatt highlighter to really highlight
my cheeks and bring out the
on the eyes and still I feel like this
is kind of like a golden wearable color
so I'm just going to go ahead and apply
that the normal places that I would
highlight and again it is a festival
makeup so I feel apply as much or as
little as you want of this I just kind
of want that golden Coachella glow going
on and this is also going to act as a
base as well for the glitters that we
apply and yeah whatever kind of color
you choose to be your highlighter is
just gonna act as that kind of color
look I kind of stick with the theme and
like the yellow on the eyes yellow
highlighter vibes you know and then just
on my Cupid's bow okay once we are
officially a glowing now we can add some
glitter so I'm going to be mixing these
two it glitters here today these are
both from NYX one is the color teal and
the other is the color gold so again the
yellow is going to really bring out the
yellow in the eyes and then the teal is
gonna obviously bring out the blue
underneath now I don't really know them
easiest way to apply this I'm just gonna
take a little bit of like glitter glue
maybe and just kind of lightly disperse
that across but I am taking like a
little mixing tray just like this and
popping up my glitters on there I'm
gonna be using the two whoa the
two-faced glitter glue to kind of help
adhere and stick them on I thought you
could just use eyelash glue or literally
like just fix+ work I know it's like
sticky but I feel like it's not sticky
enough to make it stay I'm just going to
take like a little flat brush and just
kind of tap on my cheeks and around just
kind of where I want the glitter to be
again you can place this wherever you
want to now I'm just gonna use a kind of
flat fluffy brushes from morphe this is
like the mo and just tap lightly oh girl
I'm glowing yes and then again on the
other side like so
I'm loving this and again now using the
same brush because it doesn't
we're going mixing them together anyway
picking up the teal yeah okay now we've
done that and you've applied whatever
gear that you kind of wanted to go with
this look I am gonna go in with a
slightly bigger glitter because that is
quite like finely milled this one is
from Dustin dance and it's actually
biodegradable is there Bros
biodegradable glitter which I love and
this is a slightly thicker glitter so I
am gonna be using the same active glue
but maybe just applying it slightly
heavier on top of the glist that we just
applied and I'm gonna concentrate this
mainly on the sides of my face I don't
necessarily want it on my cheekbones or
anything like that because it's not as
fine as the next glitter so just kind of
concentrating it so around the sides why
I'm gonna use the same brush because
this brush is really good it just kind
of lightly lightly picking things up and
not being too heavy with them and then
just packing that on and then hopefully
this pink will bring out the kind of
purples and oranges that we had and I
think it looks super pretty and not too
you know too much because now I've never
worn one of these before
this is from a models own it's the love
and light
all-in-one self stick face jewels this
comes with like one to go in the center
of your forehead and there's like two
little teardrops underneath it also
comes with a freckle transfers which i
think is so cool but we kind of have a
lot of a product going on on the sides
of our face for ready so we'll see what
does have a plane it also comes with a
bit of glue as well oh my god right I
feel like I just want to apply these
first this is the diamond
Queen set so let's go ahead and feel and
oh my god guys I'm literally obsessed I
don't think I've ever ever had so much
glitter on my face right now just make
sure everything is all stuck down in
place I'm now gonna go ahead and do the
lips I don't want anything it's your
really distracting the lips if you want
a colorful lip go ahead but
first of all I feel like you're gonna be
drinking eating singing doing all sorts
so a nude lip is like the easiest thing
to do at touch-up and reapply if needs
be
and you don't really have to worry about
it so much and also you don't want to
take attention away like so and then
gonna go in with the dose of colors at
desi @kt lipstick in no shade
I know this isn't like the easiest
lipstick to get hold of so I've left a
alternative down below which is slightly
more accessible and a little bit easier
to get hold of and then finally I am
gonna go in with a gloss just because
one I love a nude glossy lip and two
I've been dying to use this because I
literally got it the other day is the
Kim Kardashian makeup by mario super
nude gloss again I know it's super hard
to get hold of and I'm pretty sure it's
out stock at the moment but again I've
left a dupe for it down below and I
think that for you too I just like I
have no idea what it's going to look
like I just really want to try it oh yes
I'm literally living for this look I
feel like I've got to go out like I've
got to go to a festival right now this
is having a little bit of trouble and I
just put some glue down and I hope
that'll help I think it's just cuz
you've got a lot of makeup on so it's
just used a bit of gloom puppet and now
I'm just gonna go ahead and set
everything in place with the iconic
London perhaps it glows spray hopefully
this doesn't ruin anything
fingers crossed what and duh it's the
finished makeup look so this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this and have some fun feel
free to switch out any of the colors I'm
just obsessed with the products and the
glitter and just the fun of it all so
