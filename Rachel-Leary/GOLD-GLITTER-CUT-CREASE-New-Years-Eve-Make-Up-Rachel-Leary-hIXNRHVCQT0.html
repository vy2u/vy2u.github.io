at the moon we'd go to bed in my arms
you're safe hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today I wanted to do a super
glam New Year's even look using loads
and loads of my favourite products so if
you don't like a lot of makeup you may
not enjoy this video because this is a
full glam makeup look what I love about
this is that there's no liquid eyeliner
so on the day if you're doing your own
makeup there's no need to kind of panic
so no liquid liner can be a little bit
tricky for some people and it always
like can ruin like a really good eye
makeup if you've just put loads of
effort in so this has no liquid liner
just lots of glitter full glam or my
favourite products so it's a makeup look
that I obviously love I feel like
because I've got some burgundy tones in
the crease you could totally pair it
with a burgundy lip but on nights out
and like news and stuff I always find it
to play it safe with a nude but totally
pair it with whatever you want also this
is just like I said and I did so you can
use different colors to create the same
sort of look to ones that you're more
comfortable with or whatever so yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed this look
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
do and definitely tag me on Instagram if
you recreate it and yeah so if you want
to know how I got this look then please
keep watching in all products are listed
down below
begin I'm going to prime my eyes using
my Mac painterly paint-pot as I always
do this one's quite good if you have
kind of have a third to medium skin tone
if you're slightly fairer than me soft
ochre from Mac is a really good one and
if you're slightly more tan
I think it's called quite natural and
that one has more of a warmer undertone
then I always like to set whatever base
I use with a powder
I just think blending is so much easier
when it's powder on powder because
powders can really cling to creams and
that's when it can look quite patchy so
yeah you definitely want to set your
primer with powder for the eyes I'm
going to be using the violet Voss holy
grail palette and I'm taking these two
warm brown shades and just blending them
into my crease on a big fluffy brush I
think this one is from Sigma I always
link why I get my brushes from down
below but they are mostly normally Sigma
or Mac or morphe or something like that
and I just went in with my Mac two to
four to blend that again then taking
this are you kitten me shade which is a
slightly like not lighter slightly
warmer brown with a slightly more purple
undertone I would say just because I was
kind of going and staring towards a
slightly per player theme when it came
to the crease colors but just using a
smaller fluffy brush in the crease to
use that say something like a Mac two
one seven and then going back in with
our initial fluffy brush to blend it
together then using this Wine and Dine
color I love colors like this in the
crease this is a really nice purple
color and again just blending that in
with a slightly smaller brush then I
always like to go back in with previous
brushes that I've used just to make sure
that everything is diffused together and
it blended to kind of the standard that
I want it to then mixing these two
darker brown colors on a pointed brush
this one is from zoeva actually and then
because it's got a really nice tapered
brush or tip or whatever so I find it
works really well in the crease
especially with cut crease looks and
then going back in with my fluffy
brushes to blend it all together I did
kind of want to go quite heavy in the
crease of the colours because I really
wanted them all to show through so y'all
was being quite heavy-handed with them
but that's why I needed to make sure I
was going back in with my fluffy brushes
to blend them then I'm taking this shade
from Anastasia Beverly Hills this is
called noir they do do it in a single
form but this was just in a
that I had taking a flat shader brush
I'm using that to kind of cut out my
crease and create the kind of crease
that I wanted and then going back in
with fluffy brushes again I feel like
this is the key to every smoky eye or
cut crease or whatever and just making
sure it is all it diffused together with
the bigger brush this time I did pick up
slightly more of the first transition
colors that we use just cuz I felt like
I was losing sight of them and I wanted
to bring them back kind of into the eye
look now I'm taking it paint Li again
and this is perfect if you have slightly
hooded eyes and I'm using this to kind
of carve out my crease and create a much
more plain base because shadow did fall
down so again like I said this is really
good trick if you've got slightly hoodie
on who did eyes because you can totally
reinvent your crease and I find looking
down into a mirror makes this tip so
much easier and I think the brush I'm
using is well is from Kiko and I'm
obsessed it's quite like long and like a
duo fibre brush so it's really good with
creams and then taking this L'Oreal
infallible
eyeshadow I think this is in like iced
latté it's just a really gorgeous light
shimmery champagne color and I'm just
placing that everywhere that we kind of
created for the lid and then the glitter
I'm using is from violet Voss and it is
the champagne wishes kiss which is
glitter and I placed placed the Too
Faced glitter glue it down first and
then just place the glitter all over the
lid but kind of left the outer part like
tiniest quarter of my I kind of glitter
free just because we're going to go in
with shadow there in a minute and I find
shadow blends kind of difficult Leon to
glitter so I just left that as the iced
latté shade and then went back in and
just kind of cleaned up the crease now
I'm just cleaning up underneath my eye
with a wipe and creating that wing even
though there is no winged line I did
still want it to be a winged shape and
going back in with the wine color you
can see I'm just kind of placement on
the outer corner and then going back in
with the darker brown shades on the very
very outermost part of my eye to create
that kind of a transition and I feel
like this creates a really effortless I
look as in it looks like you put loads
of effort in but there really wasn't any
well I didn't think there was much to it
at all and it avoided winged liner and
I'm just applying mascara
and my favorite wing glasses is the
Carlie lash from the lure now for brows
I took these two brow pencils from a
benefit and my artist my Loreal brow
artist plumper and for skin I am using
my makeup forever primer in the step one
this is the hydrating one by the way
when it came to the brows I use the
shade two in the outermost part and four
at the end for the skin I am taking
these two shades of the NARS concealer
first I find this step to be really
helpful when I don't want to wear a huge
amount of foundation all over the skin
and then I'm using I just post the
custard shade down first and then it use
a little brush to clean up my wing and
then it places the Chantilly shade on
top and use a little brush like this
this is like a clean two one four and I
just buff that in all around my skin so
over my nose underneath my eye and just
kind of all around the places that I
want to highlight and conceal now I'm
using foundation these are some two of
my favorites this is the Too Faced Born
This Way in the shade sand and in the
shade 7 in the giorgio armani luminous
silk i know it looks like a lot I did
warn you but using this brush this is
almost like a blusher brush I love this
to blend in my foundation now I am
taking the mink Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour stick as like a cool tone
contour so only a little bit and then
this caramel morphe concealer as a
slightly warmer cream contour and i'm
just buffing that in with a duo fiber
brush I feel like the Anastasia contour
stick gives me more of the shadow
appearance and then the warmer concealer
from morphe gives that more bronze look
which I'm obsessed with and then I just
like to go back in with the brush I use
for foundation to tidy everything up
then I set it all with powder and I
finished off the eyes using that are you
kidding me shade underneath and mascara
now to kind of powder contour and set it
all I'm using the Bahama Mama bronzer
which is my favorite and my warm sole
blusher from Mac which is also a
favorite you can see I'm using so many
of my favorite products in this and then
a global glow mineralized skinfinish
from Mac I always say I love a kind of
shimmery bronzer for a night out I think
it just adds such a gorgeous look to
your skin and then this is from galactic
it's called their see-through bronzer
bronzer highlighter and I feel like this
gives more of a glow to the skin because
then I go ahead and place whisper of
guilt from Mac on top to give me that
kind of popping aglow then for this look
I went for a nude lip this is
stripped-down pencil from Mac and then I
use Anastasia Beverly Hills pure
Hollywood and soap &amp;amp; Glory at sexy and
mother pocket lip gloss on top in the
shade donut and that is the finish looks
I really hope you guys enjoyed this look
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you

super glam so yeah I really hope you
