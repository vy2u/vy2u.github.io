enjoyment hula guide hey guys welcome
back to my channel today I decided to
film a look as you can tell by the title
using the newest steel and magnificent
metals collection was really kinda sent
a few bits not all the bits but just
some and I have ordered some more so I
can add to my collection but I was so
excited to try them especially those
like liquid metal eyeshadows I know
they've been all over social media at
the moment so I kinda want to create a
kind of golden glam lip for you guys I
then I blow the peoples really favored
to towards the Fonzie and rose gold ones
which I have ordered because I know I'll
probably obsess over them as well but I
did use the golden one today which is so
gorgeous it's like a really nice proper
gold so I also use the eyeshadow palette
the highlighter and the new liquid
lipsticks that came with the collection
as well but also just a bunch of my
other favorite products that I kind of
love to use to achieve like a golden got
a seed type look should make sure skin
to see a thumbs up if you like to look
at this makeup look and hit that
subscribe button if you're new or you
haven't already and let's go on with the
tutorial so I already have my eyebrows
done for that I've used the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow and the microbial
pants from nyx and then i've saturated
with the 3d powder and some benefit and
sculpted it with the anastasia reveals
concealer now onto the face i'm going to
use it this and moisturizer from bliss
it's literally like the most hydrating
moisturizer devyse i love love love it
underneath my makeup I feel like it's
made such a difference in my skin and
for primer I'm going to take the benefit
Porefessional primer and concentrate
this mainly down the center of my nose
because that's what I find I have like
the most open pores and I have the most
texture and then kind of buff it out
into those kind of parameters on my face
where I don't have so much for skin
foundation today I'm going to use the
Mac Studio Fix fluid and it kind of
makes a bit of the it cover FX custom
drops in candlelight in it for a bit
more of a bronzey a glowy up finish as
you can see I promise you this shader
foundation does match the color of my
neck and my tan so I'm just blending
that in with my Beauty Blender
so concealer I'm going to take the Too
Faced Born This Way it conceal it in the
shade lightly
and just place that underneath my eyes
and pick up the size of my nose and make
my nose appear a little bit smaller and
then obviously just in the places that I
want to highlight which is normally down
the center of my face so just above my
brows and on my chin and around my mouth
and stuff and I'm just using my Beauty
Blender again to make sure that is all
blended out into my foundation then I'm
just going to go ahead and bake using my
Laura Mercier powder as always and this
brush is from a blank canvas cosmetics
and it's going to see one of my
favorites and emotion I'm also making it
short to it set my eyes as well I did
take a little bit the concealer onto my
eyes to prep them for eye shadow then to
contour I'm taking India NYX powder
contour kit and just taking the first
slightly warmer shade just because I
don't like it to be too cool and then
I'm just taking a small little brush to
contour my nose as well and I always
like to go in with my Beauty Blender
afterwards just to make sure it's not
got any harsh lines and for bronzer I'm
taking it too faced chocolate soleil
bronzer just to warm up the rest of my
face and where I just applied that
contour so I like to apply this just
kind of on my forehead on my neck as
well and yeah just on where my cheeks my
cheeks on my cheeks where I placed the
contour just to blend it and warm it up
and then I like to bake underneath that
just to tidy everything up and continue
on with the face this is Russia I'm
going to take the annexed cosmetics
ombre blusher in strictly chic and it's
almost like a peachy orange color which
I love and then I'm going to go ahead
and use the Anastasia Beverly Hills
Nicole Guerrero highlighting palette
which is out on Marshall said I think
and it is honestly amazing the shade
glows getter is 100% my fave from the
collection and if this doesn't make you
want to buy it then I don't know what
will you guys definitely need to
purchase it but then on top I'm going to
use DEA's stealer highlighter and it is
in heaven pew slightly more than perky
undertone which really really brightened
up and I wanted to place this on the top
of just kind of like an extra pop of
highlight if you guys like more like an
iridescent highlight I definitely
recommend using this one out then I am
just going to brush away the baked that
we had some underneath and as you can
see it's really kind of cleaned up our
contour and sharpened everything up and
now we can move on to the eyes so guys
I'm picking it be a sealer I think
the Matt and metals by shadow palette
and this is from their new collection as
well and just taking this kind of movie
warm brown shade and just buffing that
into the crease I think this brush is
from the way that it's one of their like
luxe crease brushes their cruise washers
are honestly so fluffy and make
everything it's so much easier to blend
and then taking this warmer color here
this is like a really right up my street
color a really nice warm brown and just
buffing that to further deepen the
crease again this is another brush from
zoeva as well it's applying as much as
you see fit I wasn't going to go to
dramatic with this look so I kind of
stuck with only about three crease
colors making sure they were already
soft and this is the final one it's
actually got a bit of a shimmer to it
which I really really really like it the
darks have warm up Brown and the bit of
shimmer just kind of added to the whole
gold and got a still that we were going
with the eyes and the whole look so yeah
normally I wouldn't apply a shimmery
color in the crease but this one was
really nice and it wasn't too intense as
you can see for the lid I met clicking
to start the show which is the liquid
metals eye shadow and this one is in at
gold goddess and that the applicator
just makes it so easy to kind of like
cover a cruise if you wanted to do like
a splinter cut crease or anything and
just play some that all over the lid I
think this would look even more intense
if I'd place maybe a foiled eyeshadow
down before or like a pigment or
something and just kind of place this on
the top but on its own I still thought
it was really pretty and then I'm taking
that glow get a shade from the same
Anastasia Beverly Hills kit with Nicole
Guerrero as my inner corner highlight
and then going back in with that zueva
brush to kind of diffuse everything
together and make sure everything's
that's lended on a small pencil brush
I'm taking that warm brown shade and
just running that underneath my eye just
to kind of connect everything together
and then from Marc Jacobs I'm taking a
Highliner
I think this is in married marigold or
something and just running that in my
water and if you guys are in the market
for like a brightly colored really
pigmented eye liners definitely check
those ones out and then again taking
that same metal eyeshadow just placing
it on the inner most part of my eye just
to kind of translate what we did on the
top on the bottom and then finally
taking a small angled brush and that
dark brown shade again just to kind of
line the top lash line I'm going to go
ahead and apply mascara and obviously
you guys could leave it there but I love
a dramatic lash and some lashes for this
look I'm at taking my faves from the loo
I think these are in the style take it
and go so they are winged out in super
fluttery I thought they really
complemented the look now onto the lips
I'm taking the liquid lipstick in the
shade
I think is and this is the one that
comes out with the collection I think
there was a dark bite as well but you
guys know I love a nude and this one was
a really gorgeous like florally pinky
personally kind of color so I really
like this but I did kind of wanna make
it slightly more warm at time to go the
look so I applied via Kiko super gloss
in one 1/3 on top
so that is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
