this is the first time I visiting my
channel hello welcome and please hit
that subscribe button before you
continue I'm so sorry I haven't posted a
video in a few days like the normal
schedule I don't know you can hear oh my
god if it happened then a sneeze already
I don't know if you can hear I'm a
little bit under the weather buy a
hundred percent money to get some videos
out I don't know what it is I just need
to get out of this funk of feeling sorry
for myself an ill and when I go up and
do things I do that a lot better so I
wanted to film a makeup look for you
guys and I've had this like visions for
ages as you can tell with the title this
is definitely more like a grungy or -
makeup look is a completely matte eye
and matte lip and it's along the like
deep red maroon theme which I know a lot
of you love around this time of year so
I really hope you guys enjoy this makeup
tutorial I used a couple of new palettes
I used the NYX elements palettes which I
got my hands on the other day which
literally only became available to us in
the UK yesterday I think or maybe like
the day before so I really hope you guys
enjoy this a makeup look and let me know
your thoughts in the comments down below
and by giving it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it like I said earlier make sure
to hit that subscribe button if you
haven't already and if you want to know
all the products I've used like always I
have left them in the description down
below but let's go ahead and get started
with a makeup tutorial okay so to begin
I'm gonna get my hair out of my face
like I usually do so we can get ready to
prep the skin because we are gonna be
doing the skin first and to begin I'm
gonna use the glam glow Volk asmik I
think it's like the matte glow
moisturizer this stuff feels incredible
on my skin I've been loving it at the
moment and it makes the perfect
moisturizer underneath your foundation
and then to prime I'm gonna use it the
wire sell all hours of primer and then
it used my Real Techniques and multitask
is this multitask face brush full
purpose face brush is there something
like that brush which is my go-to for
blending in all kind of like skin care
products on my skin and my primers and
stuff and for foundation today I'm gonna
use an old favourite this is the Too
Faced Born This Way a foundation in the
shade sand and I'm just gonna buff that
in with a good old a Beauty Blender
there is no better way to do this
normally I stipple and then use a Beauty
Blender but I find with this one that
you just need a damp and Beauty Blender
to get the best coverage and speaking of
coverage I'm gonna use my heart-shaped
tape in the shade medium I
love love this concealer it literally
airbrushes underneath your eyes and I've
been gravitating towards the shade
medium a lot more recently rather than
my slightly lighter shades just because
I'm kind of warming towards the slightly
less bright under-eye I know massive
shock but I love this shade like I said
this is the shade medium and I'm gonna
go ahead and set that in place with
powder and actually leave the powder
underneath my eyes and go ahead and do
my brows all products left down below
and I am using the NYX in your elements
palette and I'm gonna use the earth and
fire one this is the earth one and just
taking a light warm brown shade in the
crease then like I said I'm taking the
fire palette and taking this warm orange
shade and again just building up the
crease it gradually gradually and
gradually if that's the way that you say
it we're just building up the color
intensity and going back in with my
fluffy brushes to it defuse any harsh
lines and then taking it this kind of
brick-red shade on our lid by just
packing it on with a flat brush we are
going for and that I look today so I
always find using a big kind of flat
brush you get the most pickup from the
color I think going back in with the
fluffy brushes to blend it all out then
I'm taking this deeper Brown it's shade
and just going back and forth in the
crease to further deepen it I am
actually kind of building up the color
with this both of the palettes have a
dock like this kind of shade in it I
think this was from the earth palette
though but then I'm going back in with
my fluffy brushes as always you guys
know the drill this is kind of like a
super easy I look just kind of going
back in with the colors and the brushes
to blend it all together then I'm taking
the other dark brown shade that I was
literally just talking about this one
from the fire palette just to build up
the intensity a a little bit more then
I'm gonna take the highlighter that I
plan to use as my inner corner
highlighter and then I'm gonna line at
the top of my lid using the Too Faced a
sketch pink black eyeliner pen we're not
gonna do a wing it just kind of going
all the way across the lid to hide the
lash brand for when we apply lashes so
I'm just applying a coat of mascara and
the lashes i'm gonna be using art the
Koko lashes in Queen B and while the
glue is drying I'm just gonna finish up
underneath my eyes using it this NYX
eyeliner in a gold bronze and then going
back in with the lid shade that we used
from the fire palette and just running
that
like you know just puffing along the
bottom of my eye with a pencil brush and
just connecting it back in it to the
crease colors so these are the finished
eyes I'm obsessed they literally make
blue or green eyes pop life and I think
I suit any eye color but now we can move
back onto the face and this is the
bourgeois chocolate golden bronzing
powder just add a really gorgeous
luminous bronze it to my skin but then I
am gonna further kind of sharpen and
contour up my cheeks using the BH
Cosmetics highlight and contour powder
palette and then taking this shade here
which is one of the warmer ones of the
palette they had so many different kind
of shades it's really good for like a
lot of skin tones I feel but just taking
that on an angled cheek brush and then
using one of my favorite blushes this is
the NYX ombre a blush in strictly chic
and just applying that to the apples of
my cheeks for a warm flush to kind of
complement the eyes and then for
highlight so we are gonna be going in
with two because I'm feeling extra as
 and I just felt like it this is
Laura Geller gilded honey and I kind of
use this as my base highlight it's more
of like a gold and then taking it the
Ofra and nikkietutorials collab in glow
girls to literally create glow goals on
my Mac two to four brush to get a lot
more of a precise at pigmented highlight
and I'm just kind of dusting it all in
the same places that we placed at the
base highlight now I can move on to the
lips and I'm literally going to be using
it the Tarte artists at lip paint in oh
my god what's this called
damn I've forgotten I've loved the name
of it down below it's the most gorgeous
deep red color perfect for the autumn
and that is gonna be the finished makeup
look but we're gonna sell it all in
place using the glamour aglow at glow
set a setting spray I love this smells
amazing and I'm literally gonna drown in
it but then this is the finished makeup
so this is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
