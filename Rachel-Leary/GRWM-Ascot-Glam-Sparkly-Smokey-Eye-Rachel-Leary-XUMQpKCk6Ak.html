go teddy hello so first things first
let's get my hell away yeah
okay so just ignore ignore the devil
horns throughout let you see my hair on
my face so first of all I like to do my
eyebrows first so I like to use both
medium brown and blonde dip brow and
filling in my eyebrows and I always
always always fill them in with the
technically it's a winged liner brush
from Sigma it's the eo6
but on a night out I definitely prefer
to use these over a pen pythor they last
way longer
they're definitely walls of life mmm but
um like smudge resistant like pencils
just smudge way too easily so I like to
do i dip tails going to do tutorial on
like my going up brows my day-to-day
brow so I'll kind of go through it quite
quickly what I like to do is take my
angled brush and the medium dip brow and
kind of stop and zoom in a bit start
about halfway across if you can see my
eyebrows are quite sparse so I do have
to fill in a lot of the empty gaps
I just trace the bottom just kind of oh
the arch round like that and then I go
into the top again still using medium
brown like connect it down then I just
start to fill it in with just loads
little brush strokes so don't apply like
too much product cuz that's me I think
your brows look like like really fake
but you know I mean like that then
obviously this is just like an extra
step you really don't have to use two
different colored it brows if you're
more than happy to use one I just like
that kind of great more like defined
gradient effect so I take the blonde
color and take it quite towards the end
and just kind of brush it through
way back and then either get to the
front kind of the brush it this way up
and kind of feather it up it looks
really funny when I go one by one beer
and then I'm gonna take my mac studio
finish concealer in NC 15
Wow where's my polish come on a little
flat brush like this and I just use that
to scope it out so I apply most of the
product here cuz that's why I look nice
with a highlight
and just gotta blend it back
yeah then I'm just going to apply some
eye primer this is literally just like
walking back as well
I normally always just work a flesh tone
primer I feel like that way it just get
sort of any of the veins on my like
eyelid or anything and just make sure
that anything that I put on the top is
going to stay like true to color like
that I'm now going to go ahead and like
completely do this oh my god look at the
color difference I'm now going to go
ahead and do this I completely just like
it because I always do what I first just
in case I want to play around a bit or
something and I'll come back and I'll
show you this eye so I've just gone
ahead and done one eye and I'm obsessed
I asked you guys on Twitter to vote for
what you wanted to see I hit a few
options because I feel like these kind
of looks are really not like repetitive
on my channel but I do do a lot of them
so I do try and like suggest other ones
but you guys always seem to vote for
these ones so this isn't if I came up
with this was the champagne sparkly I
option so lemme and get ready with you
and show you how he's dead so mainly
gonna be using mac and morphe eye
shadows just because they're what's like
in front of me and I can rely listen I
out makeup geek morphe and Mac tend to
be like my go-go-go twos fours like
lights out and stuff just cuz it been
easiest make a noise align them so I
thought I would go like a really
highlight in a corner so that that I'm
going to be using a matte white Archer
and this is just gesso from Mac I'm
gonna take a flat shader brush
oh god sake me and I Jesus right so I'm
just gonna be it kind of really going
home and like highlighting in a corner
taking it quite far up onto my lid to
I the funniest day at work today we had
such a like like weird theme day but
like we had like pink eye shadows all
over our face and stuff like that and I
had so many of you guys come in and say
hello and I just thought I had to like
excuse myself also I'm sorry like I'm
sorry for having a pink face don't
usually look like this but now I'm going
in with the morphe 35o palette and this
really warm color here oh and that's
going to be our initial transition color
so I'm actually no that's such a lie why
do that I'm going to take vanilla from
Mac and just highlight my brow bone real
quick okay now we're taking those colors
on a fluffy brush find it easy to lip
down just so I can really see my crease
and just buff that into my soccer
like they're then taking my de leyva
brush this is like a smaller denser
crease brush and everything's everywhere
and let me forgot am i taking out this
one here which is like as just a shade
darker essentially than the one that we
just use just using that to create the
gradient also I found going like
downwards emotions when you're blending
in like across the crease gives you like
a really flawless blend I'll show you
what I mean in a second but yep but for
now I'm just like buffing this it's
circular motions not taking it higher
than that initial color otherwise that
defeats the purpose of a gradient
yeah like as I get to here I kind of
like bring it down like that you've got
it's like sunset going on then taking
this middle shade to do exactly the same
thing but this time on this brush from
crown it's like a tapered blending brush
which I really like just of like this so
just concentrating that a bit lower and
the tapered kind of tip allows hit
really into my crease yeah Lucy if
you're watching this you know what
message you've just sent me Wow okay my
face green soiling like that now I'm
going to go in with the lid color I
recently got this new pigment from
Illamasqua if you follow me on snapchat
it is the color for or if you are o are
e for all I think we just like the most
gorgeous champagne color it's kind of
like your classic no money no honey from
the bomb or afterglow from makeup geek
that kind of color and it's gonna
concentrate let's pack up handsome a lid
kind of taking it just over halfway
across again looking down or really
helps the cause and make sure that you
don't transfer it to the top and then
I'm going to go back into the brush that
we use to apply like the brow bone
highlight and stuff and take a bit more
of that gesso color and take it a bit
further up onto my lid just so it all
blends in those feet together and it's
Arneson right
I like to repeat each step until you're
happy so I'm gonna dig around that
pigment there - like that
and on that Zoe the brush that we used
earlier this is what I meant by like the
dragging down motion I'm not going to
take any excess product but I'm going to
take it and then between obviously the
champagne color and the lid I'm just
going to like brush down and you see
like it just blends flawlessly I'd do it
safe and then now I'm going to take a
super precise brush from Sigma it's a
facilities brush but it's just way more
precise and the color round down from
max it's just basically a really dark
matte Brown I'm going to use this to
further deepen up top there
now using this away brush to blend it
out if you guys follow me on my social
medias you guys know that tonight I'm
going to ask Scott what you've been told
it's like super glam but I'm not in
before so I'm just kind of going with it
and doing a look there you know I think
peeps will appreciate but it's not like
the basic like I know a lot of people
associate a Scott with races we're just
going to at this bar there
I never venture out of my hometown
really so if you have no need good
places in like this sorry area to not go
out in of you're from the UK let me know
I'd like to know but now for the sparkle
I'm going to take Mac route
what is it funny though I'm just buying
everything right I'm taking Mac reflex
gold on a brush like this I'm going to
spray my lid with six plus to act as an
adhesive and then press the glitter on
the public keep your eye close because
you've now got like a wet the wet lid so
you don't want it transfer to keep
looking down and then with the gift of
just concentrating that where you put
the champagne color and then just taking
it tiny bit into the crease colors but
also you don't want glitter all over
your lid I just I'm sorry if you guys
are getting sick with these warm colors
I can only like I know I don't even
wanna blow dries I just loved them so so
much I think they just look the best man
right now here take a wipe and clean up
my edge as per usual you could use tape
or whatever to do this also we're
getting ready in silence as normally
I've got music playing if you guys have
Spotify um I have a playlist or now my
user names like Rachael Larry six or
eight cherry six so you can kind of see
what homies come into do I want to say
kind of any more times kind of
on the negative are I took it's a farm
but me to dem symbols
yeah now with that being that I should
have done I'm gonna pile it's black but
I'm going to do that off my eyeliner so
I'm going to do my eyeliner up camera
because I literally go down like this so
I don't want there to be shape footage
so I'm gonna do my line out and then
come back wing done oh my god what is in
my favor today if you like that wing my
pet well but now I'm going to take a
really short little shader brush like
this and a black eyeshadow I'm using
carbon from that bit I can't really lift
up and show you but it's just a black
eyeshadow but my little pin I'm just
gonna keep this really concentrated wow
it's really concentrated in the
outermost part this trick is like a
godsend if you mess up your liner and
then you put it like black shadow there
because when you like blend in you can't
really see any sort of mistake so if you
make a mistake with your liner on like
the top part of your liner using a black
eyeshadow to smoke out your look has a
little trick and I'm taking that little
brush that we used earlier the brown
down eyeshadow I can take a tiny bit
more of the brown down but not too much
and just use that to buff it in I don't
mind being it mess with this because
I'll just use my wife again my clap now
I'm just gonna take my white clean up
the edge and that's it for a shadow I'm
just going to apply mascara and lashes
mascara I'm just applying a little coat
of the Mac in extreme dimension Escarra
which is phenomenal if you even make
like doing water wear false eyelashes
disc is a really full of volumizing
false lash effect custom formula of it
is like super moussey
like so and the lashes I'm going to be
using are inspired by shiny grimmons
birthday get ready with me is the fara
ones from huda beauty and these are like
my actually waves the
she kind of reminded me how much I love
them so petitions that I'm just gonna
pop them on and then I'll show you the
finished eyes and then we will get
started can so these are the finished
eyes with the Farrah lashes on I'm
obsessed
these like my favorite products as you
guys know so now let's move on to the
skin so for my primer I'm going to be
using the illamasqua radiance BHEL BHEL
BHEL which is so nice I recently got
this and it's literally like you know
like the Becca liquid and you know the
better cosmetics liquid versions of
their highlighters it's like that but
obviously it's like a primer now you can
see where I put on like my nose my lips
it's literally making me ball okay so
the foundation I'm going to be mixing
obviously I just really like mixing
foundations at the moment I don't know
what it is either you might just be like
the color and coverage and that
customizability I'm going to be mixing
my NARS illumise illumise still my NARS
all day luminous and my eye makeup Ella
Ultra HD together as you can see once
again rich was two different colors
shock horror so this might look slightly
darker at first but I promise that make
sense
I got way too aggressive hold on I've
smudged stay calm stay calm blend around
don't do this side like just because you
like apply a lot doesn't mean it's going
to be cakey just on the place that I
want a bit more coverage which is like
the size of my face that is just the
only person that I take the stick and
I'm going to use a Beauty Blender to
apply it like blend it in just because
that way it's going to absorb any of the
excess put it that saan my face as well
and really press it into the skin
well moving on to concealer I am just
going to be using the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer in and neck seat in NC 21 else
find that that Pro Longwear concealer I
either you break it or you can't get the
remaining pull up to out where's my
little concealer brush gone so as always
I'd like to take this excess concealer
from underneath my eyes and just use
that to really sharpen now winged
sharpen it the liquid color bitch and
just blending out I've always with my
Beauty Blender when I just said earlier
booty Blender
hello so before I go in with any powders
anything I am going to cream contour
using this Giorgio Armani
maestro liquid summer bronze in the
color one one zero and just buff it into
the skin so cute cones tops of the
forehead a little goes a really long way
with this product so like be careful
boys buff upwards as well
such like gorgeous product and I'm
kidding it blends so nicely into the
skin right so that's all the cream
products done now to set my under eyes
what I've been really liking is I'm
going to use a loose powder just because
unlights out there are the best in terms
of just blasting keeping everything in a
place and prevent increasing oh I've
been really liking mixing my translucent
one from Laura Mercier with this
translucent highlighting luxury powder
from Oprah and this one's slightly more
yellow they use my Sigma tapered brush
to apply and then I'm just going to
apply this in all the places up here
essentially applied the highlight so I'm
going to kind of a partly baked around
the nose especially I find is a
nightmare area and then all the other
kind of places I just kind of lightly
dust it because I don't really get oily
there but you know where you guys get
away so you just apply it wherever I'm
going to brush any excess away yeah I
got I got the hiccups
so that's the powder done I'm going to
quickly just finish off the eye makeup
by going back into one of the medium
brown shades that we used from the
morphe palette then just running that
along my lower lash line
Wow just applied way too much damn you
pigmented eyeshadows Mir now quit get it
off
be going bitch like so and then I think
I'm just going to take the brush that we
used earlier to apply that Illamasqua
pigment and just whatever is left on it
just take it just on like the little
you're in a lower lashline I'll do a
close-up in a minute but I'm just going
to apply bottom lashes
so that's the eyes done but like I said
I'll do a close-up in a second now
moving on to the powders I'm going to
bronze my skin I am going to take medium
tan but I skin finish from Mac on a big
powdery crush as my like initial
bronzing color you guys know I go hand
with bronzer like that now the necrons
er is Mac give me Sun which is just a
same inner eye skin base a bit darker
but I really concentrate this one like
the very perimeters of my face and use
it to kind of contour a bit super warm
for contouring I know that oh well then
it for blusher I'm gonna take Milani
berry amore amore brosher well pigmented
yeah oh oh I forgot I'm gonna take a bit
of them I'm just taking it well this is
gold deposit from Mac it's a good
shimmery bronzer I'm just let's just
work it everywhere
I like this on the tops of my forehead I
think it looks nice is there highlight
I'm going to take moonstone by Becca
whoa skin done finally lips as I like
applying lips is really boring so I
might skip through this but just you
know what's on them it is the NYX nude
beige lip pencil the open liquid
lipstick in Sao Paulo and the Marc
Jacobs lip gloss in moonglow's so by the
time I've done that I'll have finished
makeup look so the next thing that you
see will be the finished look
so that is my finished makeup look
complete I hope you guys enjoyed it just
