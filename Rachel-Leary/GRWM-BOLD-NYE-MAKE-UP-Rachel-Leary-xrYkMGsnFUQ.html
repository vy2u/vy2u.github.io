today I'm kind of filming this as a
chatty kind of get ready with me while I
do this makeup and as you can tell about
the title it's something a bit more
bolder for those of you that love a pop
of color I just wanted to go for blue
because I found somebody called blue
products I really wanted to use and I
feel like I don't do a huge amount of
dramatic color on my channels so I
thought this would be cool but it's been
really cool to go with something if you
just ran like black or white and you
need like statements somewhere why not
do it on your eyes you can tell you
switch up the colors to whatever
glittery that you want I just decided to
go for blue because why the hell not
also realize this is my last video of
2017 so I really hope you guys enjoy it
make sure you have an incredible new
year's whatever you're doing even if
it's just on the sofa at home or you're
going out make sure you stay safe but
yeah if you want to kind of get ready
with me and chat along with me and maybe
learn some new tips and tricks and stuff
while you're getting ready as well then
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
subscribe if you haven't already quick
do it now and let's get started all so
let's get started
all right so I'm gonna film this as a
get ready with me but I always like to
do one eye first just cuz not hundreds
unsure what I'm doing yet so I'm gonna
go ahead and do one eye and then I'll be
back to show you how to do the rest
all right what are you saying boys and
girls I really like electric bill I
think I never normally wear blue because
I've got blue eyes but the warm tones in
the dude are I like it okay so that's
starting now I think it's a primer that
I know always works and that is my go-to
for a night out is Mac painterly
paint-pot I always use this so sorry if
you guys are a bit sick of it but I
definitely prefer creamy
um faces as opposed to ones in that
squeezy tubes that don't really have a
lot of color just because I think my
eyes have like kind of a bit of like a
veiny pigmentation so I won a color
coverage I did say um in my previous
tutorial like if you all have slightly
more fair skin soft ochre from Mac is
suddenly more yellow based lighter
alternative and if you're setting more
tanned then I would say I think this one
called it quite natural or camel coat or
something they're the shades of the Mac
ones that are like matte color and those
ones are slightly more warmer and deeper
in tone and then always when I apply a
cream base I like to set it with a
powder I really if you guys struggle
with blending or anything this is a
really good tip just to sitting wherever
you've done to your eye base with a
powder so then any powders that you put
on top just blend sorry Mike okay so for
the eyes I'm using all one palettes
because I'm all the colors in here I
thought would go with this look and I
know she sells them individually and you
can get ones that are pretty similar to
this from other brands whatever so you
can just use this as a color guidance
I'm taking it this palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills it is the world
traveler palette and I'm going to mix
the shades soft peach and Morocco
together and this is going to be my
initial transition color and I'm going
to
in with a Mac two to four to do this I
feel like if you need to invest in like
one amazing blending brush Mac the Mac
two to four is like a go-to for me I'm
obsessed with it I think anyone would
agree I know I'm raising raves about
this brush and when I used to work at
Mac this was like everyone's favorite
brush this one would work really nicely
with creams as well like on the face I
knew a lot of people used to use a 2 to
4 plate concealer so I'm just dipping my
brush back and forth in the soft peach
and Morocco color kind of when I'm out
towards here picking up more of the soft
peach color because the next shade that
we are going to use is just the Morocco
shade on its arm next though then yeah
like I said I'm going in with a 2 to 4
from Mac no.21 7 from Mac now and just
picking up that Morocco shade on its own
and just kind of concentrating this
almost pretty much half way over my lid
and then just like buffing it back up
into my crease this one's a slightly
more defined brush so I find this works
better with slightly darker colors and
just because the brush I think really
fits into people's sockets nicer then a
2 to 4 I'm going back with the 2 to 4
and just blending it all together okay
and then I'm gonna mix the shade Morocco
and fudge together which is just a
really darker Brown and I'm gonna use
the brush that comes with the palette so
it's just like a really small fluffier
brush and yeah like I said I'm gonna mix
Morocco and bunch together and it just
concentrate that again slightly lower
and not as far across the lid as the
Morocco shade because that's how you
want the gradient but just so yeah just
kind of like slightly lower than the
previous colors and because it's a nice
fluffy brush kind of makes it a lot
easier to blend together
just kind of like buffing that fudge
shade into the crease and then I'm gonna
go back in with the soft peach of
Morocco on the tooth tooth for and just
kind of diffuse the edges so gather and
then we actually didn't go back in with
that t17 and just the Morocco shade and
just kind of press that back into the
center of my eye just to get that
gradient back as you can see there then
buff around like that for the lid shade
I'm gonna take this really gorgeous a
blue color it isn't the color as you and
this is a sigma smudge e 21 brush is
something really small just because I
find with shirring shadows the smaller
the brush I think the more pigmentation
you can get on and it's gonna kind of
smudge it across because again that's
how I find out get the most pigmentation
with color but we are going to go in
with Anson core like glitters and like a
cream shadow on the top and so this is
just gonna be the kind of base color
that makes sense so mainly wanting the
pigmentation and like the most of the
product just on the first half of the
eye and I always like to look down
because then I can really see my crease
so I don't take the color too high
either and just kind of back and forth I
don't like to take it all the way into
the inner corner because then I find
when I do my inner corner highlight um
it mixes with the blue too much I want
there to be like a blank space there
then yeah just pressing it all over my
lid and then as I get to where I put the
crease colors just kind of press it on
cuz then we will diffuse it together but
I'll just be with a fluffy brush like
that then with that two to four blue
blue left I'm gonna pick up that Morocco
shade again just press that back in
literally just pressing it on and then
again on that little brush back in with
the fudge color and just buffing that
back into the crease so they don't lose
any of that kind of a gradient going
across but I think I want to take that a
pseudo color just actually a bit further
of course the lid I want that to be more
blue because that's the kind of star of
the show I'm happy with that so now I'm
gonna go in with this product this is
from urban decay is their cream
eyeshadow or liquid moon dust I shoulda
in the shade viga I think and I wasn't
really sure how to use this cuz when i
swatched on my hand it wasn't massively
pigmented so I thought it would look
like a good is like an eyeshadow topper
if that makes sense like you know you
get these lip toppers at the moment so I
want I'm just gonna Oh paint that on
over the top of where I just have put
that blue eyeshadow and just yet as I'm
getting going across into these warm
colors I'm just being really light
handed because I don't want there to be
too much right up there because we're
gonna have to blend that better when it
dries and yeah just kind of building up
the color intensity with that one that
this this product
all right and me that's just not enough
glitter but I find it I find really
chunky glitter on a night out to be
quite annoying sometimes I've been
really loving using just like glitter
eyeliner all over the lid I feel like
that's not more comfortable I know the
Urban Decay like Midnight Cowboy liner
is like everyone's favorite to do that
but because we're doing blue I'm gonna
take the it's the star liner from
Natasha to Nonna and this is the step to
it section I mean it's just going to get
my brush and just paint it across my lid
so it's literally just like glitter but
I am gonna kind of concentrate this meny
and like the inner part of my eye just
because this takes a little longer to
dry so when I go in with the shadows to
kind of diffuse this together I don't
want there to be like wetness there if
that makes sense
so I'm always making sure to look down
as well so it doesn't really transfer up
across onto my lid or anything
I mean anti-crease anything so yeah like
I said I'm just gonna go back in
slightly with that Morocco and fudge
shade I'm gonna mix them together on my
like two one seven brush I'm just gonna
press just where the colors meet as you
can see like that just drag it down
blending and then I'm gonna pick up my
little smudge it by the gun
my little smudger brush that had the eye
shadow wanna pick up that same as your
blue eye shadow and use that to diffuse
them together as well create that's like
a smoother transition because this is
like powder - powder now if I make sense
I was told I was quite good at
explaining things and like being
education when it came to makeup I used
to work in like retail so if I'm not
explaining very well I apologize and
I've let myself down and again I just
like to go back in with the shades I've
used sometimes just to blend everything
together I think I'm gonna take this
fudge shade a bit higher across the
learn'd prefer the dark ones I think the
darker color blends a bit better
yeah and then I'm just gonna go back in
with the two to four and just butt out
that crease line and then I'm going to
use this little brush from a backstage
beauty this is the prestige pencil brush
it's just a slightly thicker like
fluffier one and pick up the shade noir
from the same palette I use this in my
previous tutorial it's like my favorite
black eyeshadow ever and just
concentrate this mainly on their like
real like outer parts of the eye look
she just like that
just cut it the outer part in and then
going back in the depth to g4 brush I'm
just gonna dab like music more like a
dabbing motion brother and back and
forth and now I'll use the back and
forth buffing motion absolutely rich
it's kind of like the outer part now for
my favorite part I'm gonna take a little
wipe and just clean up underneath my eye
cos we've had some fun I just like to
kind of pull at the side just to kind of
tighten the skin and you can kind of
make this as high as you want as low as
you want like whatever I kind of like to
go for something slightly lower because
I always find when I'm tidying up I
always end up going higher and higher so
I don't want to start off too high like
that and then before I do eyeliner I'm
just gonna highlight my inner corner and
to do that I'm gonna use the highlighter
that I'm gonna use my face which happens
to be a Becca moonstone so I'm just
gonna take a little bit of a pencil
brush and just press that into the gap
that we created there
like that so now it is on to the liquid
liner and I'm gonna use my NYC liquid
liner to do this so I'd start on the
inner corner Oh
and just drag it across I'm quite
confident with a liquid liner when I use
this one because I'm so familiar with
that and it's one of my all-time
favorite ones as well I think they
discontinued it from boots and Superdrug
I never see it anymore so you can only
get it from Amazon which is where I
always link it to but I feel like that's
slightly easier so I just like to kind
of create the thickness that I one I'm
gonna I've like a medium I think and
then you guys know just like to trace
the botton face like a little dragon
nation kind of create the line I want
come back in on don't start coming back
in from like the very end of the line I
leave it about like a centimeter or
whatever look down wait where am I here
look down and connect and then fill in
and then I just build upon like that
so Wow
yay now I'm just gonna apply mascara but
before we do that as in lashes I'm gonna
do my eyebrows and I saw a few comments
on the previous video so you guys really
liked the way I'm doing my eyebrows at
the moment and that has been using a
darker dip brow or pencil through the
end and then benefit goose booth brat
boom good poop brow pencil in shape too
through the front and then I really love
using a lighter brow gel through it as
well so that's why I've done for this
one so I'm just gonna go ahead and do it
with this one so I'm taking it the
anastasia beverly hills brush number 14
and starting like midway through my brow
this is where i want this put up to kind
of like mainly be and I just I don't use
long motions I use lots of like little
ones I feel like that way it dispenses
product a lot like more evenly and it
means like there's less era of mistakes
unless errant less root mistakes I love
to use like a dip brow to create the
tail as well I feel like it's super
pigmented in the product is super
pigmented and I really don't like have a
tail to my brow as you can see so I have
to like defo create one and this looks
kind of the closest to like what a real
brow would look like a real thick brown
so I just kind of end the tail of my
brow towards the end of my eyeliner will
not be a bit more curved there like that
and then yeah I like to use the goof
proof I can't say it the goof proof brow
pencil and shake too from benefit
through the front I can be a bit
heavy-handed with this because it's a
much lighter color so it does require a
bit more pressure but I just like to
drag it through then as I get towards
the front go up to mimic the kind of
motion of the hairs that
already there the color is just much
more complimentary on like my lighter
hair as well and then yeah once I'm
happy with that I like to go into the
lighter brow gel and this is the brow
artist plumper in like medium from
L'Oreal and I feel like this just gives
them a bit more of a 3d effect
especially on the end of my brow when
it's really dark so this kind of lines
it up slightly sets all in place
and it makes them look a lot sick and
like it's got more time stir which I
think again looks more okay so if the
lashes I'm gonna take a brand new pair
of house of lashes Iconix I'm gonna go
ahead and do that off camera because I
feel like this is gonna be a struggle
but yeah I'm obsessed with these as you
guys know so let me just put these on so
these are the eyes done will half done
with the lashes on so you can still see
the kind of drama on the lip then but I
just think they add a really nice effect
it doesn't look now we can move them now
moving on to the skin I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm mister eyes using my favorite
moisturizer this is the Mac strobe cream
this one has the sucky peachy undertone
to it um I love the regular one just as
much and I just picked this one up cuz I
saw that they were doing it so I just
like to apply this all over my skin you
guys know I like to use a brush for this
I'm so annoyed my skin is like really
not good at the moment
I went through a good stage and now
we've reached the crap stage it was only
a matter of time right once we
moisturize I'm just gonna use a primer
this is the benefit Porefessional primer
and I'm just gonna place this onto my
hand oh my god sorry that just explode
ever in my hand I'm gonna place this
kind of down my nose area like kind of
like my t-zone because that's what I
find foundation doesn't really cling as
much and comes off like the like the
most I'm gonna use that same brush just
to kind of like and let it down with the
motion as well just to kind of
apply that like so and this brush is the
morphe 339 by the way now as you if you
guys watched my previous video you I
mentioned that I really like this
technique of doing my concealer first
trying to avoid wearing foundation
everywhere and concealer on the top and
stuff so I'm going to use the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation in the shade
light and just apply that underneath my
eyes this one's a very kind of yellow
base one which I love and as you can
actually see I'm pretty pale a moment
for me because I'm it's about to be New
Year so I'm kind of execrable off all my
old tan ready to reapply like tomorrow
or tonight doesn't thing so I'm just
gonna apply that underneath my eyes and
then where is it then I'm gonna use like
a little eye fluffy brushes there's a
way the luxe soft definer brush a clean
Mac 2 and 7 is basically exactly the
same and I'm just gonna buff this into
my skin apparently it's not really a
thing like go out on new years I never
seemed like Garrity's but I was talking
to a few people whenever one was on with
a comment anything worse and going out
on New Year's and like you just miss
when it looked like look like the clock
strikes 12:00 like I don't know I was
thinking oh maybe I need to grow up and
stop going out but I'm actually going to
Brighton again the New Year's I went
there last year is such a good night so
we're going again so if any of you guys
are bright and you're going to prison
I'll see you there maybe I should tend
to lose my vision it's maybe I won't see
oh my god I look terrifying right quick
quick the foundation I'm going to take
the Natasha de Nona face glow foundation
and I'd not actually use this with God I
have I could Beauty Bay voucher and I
you purchased this in the beauty of a
it's sale and I'm just gonna pump this
around it's really quite full coverage
actually so you don't need a huge amount
on and I find it using
buffing brush something like round works
better with this and this is this away
that silk finish 102 foundation and this
is meant to go with my paler skin I'm
just kind of pressing that in always
gotta be careful if you've done your
brows first that you don't like wipe
them off when you apply the foundation
around this part right foundation done
I'm gonna go ahead and set that all in
place with my Laura Mercier powder
you're probably all sick to death with
this part of it on the seat there's a
reason why everyone uses it and it's
because it is the best I feel like it
just sets everything in place you can
really brighten up your under-eye with
it if you bake with it I feel like
personally I stay matte like all day if
I use this yeah it's just honestly such
a good investment I feel like um it
lasts the longest time as well this and
the RT in May when I feel like I always
go back to these two but this one is I
feel like a cult favorite amongst most
people do you want to concentrate that
mainly obviously where you personally
get oily or you find that makeup comes
off the most
but then I've kind of just buffed it all
around because we're going to cream
contouring today I'll mix it up a little
bit right I'm gonna go ahead and contour
now though and I'm going to use a powder
contour to start with and that powder
contour and this one is from peaches
makeup and it's their sculpting powder
I'm going to take this multi brush it's
the g37 and just carve away this isn't
what I'm using as my bronzer okay I'm
just kind of using this to create that
line and diffuse up slightly I did draw
a line and then go back and forth and
kind of buff up like that and then for
bronzer today I'm going to take this
mineral bronzer from neve cosmetics in
the color seychelles so it's actually
like a shimmery bronzer which you guys
know I'm obsessed with like sherry
bronzes that might
I'm gonna take there's a waiver Lux
cheek finish a brush and just kind of
DAB my brush in it I'm gonna dab off a
lot of the excess because it is like I
said a mineral powder so it's a loose
powder so you don't want to like someone
just shat on your face so tapping a lot
of the excess off even though it feels
like maybe all of its off the brush you
can't see anymore they'll still be
product there and then I'm just gonna
see don't you go get I'm gonna dab this
all around my face first and then buff
it in actually thought was gonna be a
lot more shimmer than that but it's not
so it kind of just has more but the glow
to the skin using a lot of glowy
products today okay with the bronze are
done I'm gonna go and I'm gonna go on
I'm gonna go in with this galactic face
glow in the color gold and it has
slightly something I has a slightly
peachy undertone so I feel like this is
gonna act for me personally more what
I'm getting a zit for is my cool my like
under highlight base and like a blusher
so I'm gonna take a little brush oh look
yeah that's kind of giving me like a
little golden Laura undertone that is
there and now I'm gonna go back in with
what we use is our inner corner
highlight so the Becca moonstone and
just place that on top using a clean two
to four mm-hmm and that is the skin
complete so I'm now just gonna go back
to finish off the eyes and I'm in it
you're just gonna run that Morocco
eyeshadow on a pencil dress don't
remember the on a pencil brush and just
buff that underneath this is the eyes
completed with mascara on now I'm going
to go ahead and do lips personally for
me I know I would go for like a really
light nude but
because I didn't want to draw any
attention away from the eyes that's
going on but I feel like I did that in
my last look and I feel like I see if
you comment saying that you're bored of
it so I'm going to do a nude I feel like
a lot of people actually prefer which is
more like a dark nude this is the Kylie
cosmetics liquid lipstick in a merry
there are so many alternatives this
character like everyone's got a clip
stick in this color it's kind of close
to like Max or or I know that's a a
pencil but um like that whole like
velvet teddy type vibe I personally like
to use like a liquid lipstick to over
line my lips obviously don't have to if
you don't like that look or whatever
they're just gonna go back in with that
kind of peach below highlighter and just
kind of really highlight my Cupid's bow
and we are done
so this is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed it like I said
something a bit brighter and bolder and
I think this would go really well if
you're just brain like a simple color
like black or white on New Year's and
you want to add a pop of color and
somewhere why not on your eyes obviously
you can switch out to whatever color you
want but I decided to go for can't
believe this is my last video of 2016
has been a crazy year and I can't wait
to see what 2017 has in store so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
