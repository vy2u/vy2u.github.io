channel so I'm a bit more in a relaxed
background stay back in my bedroom at
all time did your og use of my channels
but as you can tell by the type of this
video I'm off to a a concert today I'm
going to see the weekend and buy some
tuna in the London Oh - if I saw any of
you guys there by the time Cesare yeah
thank you I've seen tweets Levi saying
that you're going as well yeah I just
thought I would service also get ready
with me I did want to do a clothing haul
but none of it will have as it arrived
in time including what I wanted to wear
today which is really annoying but this
t-shirt will be an occasional as well
but that will go up on Thursday so I
thought I would film a get ready with me
today instead so it's like a glam look
and kind of like casual but kind of a go
glass effortless glam in the clothing
and hair department and then cover
before deep space which is my kind of
favorite look to do so really have you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to hit
that thumbs up button and subscribe if
you haven't already and let's go on with
the video
when back in my bedding sales but I
would literally get ready with you guys
because this is normally where I get
ready I've got like a little make up
desk in my room besides my filming room
so I actually fake time to my face last
night and I know I would say another tie
my face but I have a really good facial
tanner and this one is from North valid
if you like this it is a what does it
say it's like lightly spray onto a
makeup sponge and gently Bend of your
face and neck level of a blur and it
literally gives you the most gorgeous
can I use the little Nick's buffing
brush I did this last night so I kind of
slept on it so this kind of looks like
but it's really nice it doesn't make you
to times or anything I think you just
make the skin look like the best I can
so did you say make I'm going to go with
something probably quite a bronzy but I
was actually inspired by a little you
guys country do the I love styler he had
new tutorial that he posted should have
really dark brown smokes out lower
lashline he was really blown out and
then something quite bronzy on the top
and I thought I really liked the idea of
that cuz I love a bronzy i but I
normally just match it underneath so I
thought I'd go with something darker and
why I like something dark in the wolf
line as well so I think I'm going to go
with that I've got a few at new at skin
carry bits from Urban Decay so let's get
started so tip again I'm going to use
this from Urban Decay is that quick fix
spray is the Hydra charged complexion
that prep priming spray and it's got
like coconut water in it and it smells
amazing and it says to use before
moisturizer and because I'm going to be
applying quite a lot of makeup because I
went to last
I've had a lot my skin to be really kind
of prepped the best that it can so I'm
going to go ahead and apply this and I
will be applying the moisturizer as well
this smells amazing literally like
coconut after I've sprayed that I'm
going to go in my favorite moisturizer
at the moment which is via bliss drink
encuentran moisturizer it's literally
one of those like really wet skin
moisturizers and I love that and I know
because of the foundation I'm wearing it
the foundation is really sick so I want
my like I said before my skin feels
really hydrated underneath so the
revealed too tight and it blends really
well as well it just feels so nice on my
skin I can't even tell you
so for primer I'm going to take this new
one from Urban Decay it is their self
adjusting that
protection primer and it's adapting
pigment soft-focus secret soft focus
effect and shine controls I thought that
going to be perfect for where I'm going
I don't want to be gang shiny I want to
be getting shiny and oily throughout the
day because I want my makeup to loft
so I'm just going to take a couple of
pumps now I will buy I will say about
this I have used it before it has quite
a like like white it does kind of
lighten up your skin slightly as you'll
see as I apply it you can kind of see it
does leave a little bit of a lightening
effect other people can I'm going to be
applying quite a full coverage
foundation on the top of death it's not
so much an issue for me but if you've
got quite dark skin and you don't like
to wear a lot of makeup and so the
foundation that you're going to be
putting on top is quite like a
lightweight one I probably wouldn't
recommend this primer just because I
would hate for you to feel like it looks
ashy or anything because it's like
unless like a white layer if that makes
sense for foundation today I'm getting
into an old favorite and it is the Kat
Von D locket tattoo foundation I am
going to be using a Beauty Blender to
apply just because if you've ever tried
this foundation it is literally so like
full coverage you've ever need any of it
and this way is just going to help help
it's just going to help me it blend it
out onto my skin if you stripes on the
skin and like I said if using my Beauty
Blender to them out this is in the shade
I think this is in the shade medium at
54 you want to go slightly more yellower
based ones I think I am doing my skin
first just because um I I'm going to be
doing quite like a blown-out look and I
do a so I just go not look I like curved
on my skin because I don't want to be
like um sharpening anything else I
really want it to be blown out and smoky
and I feel like I can achieve that when
I've done my face now we want to
consider I'm going to use the top shape
tape in light/medium literally with my
favorite like higher-end concealers is
the most gorgeous gorgeous coverage and
finish literally it doesn't crease the
applicator
like amazing I'm feeling like it's
becoming more and more accessible for
people because the demand for is just so
high if you get the chance definitely
try it
honesty would change your life so I'm
just going to apply this underneath my
eye and up the bridge of my lorry and
when you made yourself look like a fool
miss I'm going to take a deal on mini
Beauty going to finish out these guys
for my snapchat I got send their little
range that's like their set and it's
like a big medium and small one and I
think this one is mint pork this is so
good for like getting and I sit in a
corner I'm just going to take it a
little bit onto my eyes well sometimes I
like to use that for a primer I wonder
if I'll see any of you guys at this
concert later than a few tweets to see
that you guys are going I'm so glad I'm
like obsessed with the weekend and
Bryson tiller is supporting and I love
him as well literally my life 2017
resolution was to see more people in
concert that I never go to concerts and
like go to festivals and already I've
seen it Drake and Tiger and like this is
my final concert I vote tag so far so
pretty good people I would say to start
off the year and I'm just going to go
back in with the original beach dance I
use for my foundation and just make sure
that that little guy didn't miss any
good and it's all blended together so
the final thing I'm going to do why
actually the second to final thing
before we move on to the eyes is I'm
just going to cream that contour a
little and for that I'm going to use me
and NYX full coverage concealer pot and
this is in the shade nutmeg so I'm just
going to take this a more PG at 37 brush
just apply that to my cheekbones then I
just kind of like to stipple
the excess product I'd literally just
lit ages and I'm really liking how it's
not dispensing too much I mean I only
just kind of like dabbling brush in but
I'm just going to blend it up and just
connect all and stop the faucet and just
using the same brush what this is going
to do is just kind of warm
up the complexion I actually just kind
of prefer the appearance of a cream
continental powder I feel like it lasts
a bit longer as well love that and I'm
just going to use the defender again
adjust my forehead to make sure that's
all Preston and blending Callie you
really love the finishes Arden if you
can see but then I am going to take my
trusty Laura Mercier powder this is a
must for like any event that you think
that you're going to be sweating a lot
and like you need your makeup to last a
long time I'm now going to take the
medium-sized one and just apply that
underneath my eye to let it bake and I
believe my contour to shove it up
I'm really scared oh stop doing like
half my eye shadow and the doors going
to go and I'm going to ask the door like
this and be like and now I'm going to
move on to my eyebrows by any little
practice of what I'm going to do first
so I'm going to go through I'm going to
go ahead and do one eye and eyebrow and
then I'll be back to show you how I did
it okay
so this is what I came up with you're
probably thinking another bronze lip I
mean who later different products and
it's a lot darker on the lower lash line
which I really like and I'm obviously
gonna do a look that I love until
comfortable so I'm just going to make
sure that everything is kind of set in
place on the lid just like blending any
creams if they've crease and then just
setting them in place with powder still
so I think my outfit is going to have a
lot of kind of like red in it I think
I'm going to be wearing like a bread
ketchup
fuck shake having to ask to draw with
your face like this I knew that was
gonna happen I was saying it's what my
outfit was gonna have the resonance I
wanted it to be like really red and warm
on the eye so for my initial transition
color this is from makeup geek and it's
chickadee and I'm just going to buff
that into the crease and kind of wing it
and blow out I'm kind of doing like a
half cup cruise cut look so I always
like to take my initial color quite far
across the lid as well
and then pass it up into the crease I'm
one of my favorite ready Brown
eyeshadows is orbital makeup geek and
this is in the color Morocco I'm just
going to press that onto the lid to
start with and then same as before just
buck up into the crease just making sure
to kind of like a blow it out and create
that kind of angular shape it's not
gonna be a completely sharp wing bit
just I've blown out some icky look let
you guys know I love so much you're
going back in with that brush that has a
chickadee shade on just to make sure
everything is all really nicely diffused
out then at the fur that you took the
crease this one is from makeup geek as
well and it is called sidekick and it's
like a really nice warm Brown really
similar to I would say Brown script from
Max or something I'm just going to
concentrate this unlike the main lead
outer part push it onto the lid and
blend upwards and this is like the
darkest color that we're going to use on
the top because I don't want to use this
really dark color on the top I want the
top to be like fire and pausing and like
really light and it lifts my eyes and
then this to kind of like close and
slightly and that gives you that more
like as your my seductive look don't ask
me why I'm going for that kind of look
while I'm at a concept because obviously
nothing's going to happen because I love
these colors together okay so I'm just
going to leave that there I'm now going
to sculpt out my crease a little bit and
I'm going to use the a Maybelline Color
tattoo in creme de nude pretty much the
same type of product and color product
is soft over from Mac then I always just
like to look down into the mirror to
sculpt it out and then I just like to
use my seat weight and then I just like
scoop then I just like to use my finger
and just kind of blend it in initially
and then I'm going to take that Morocco
shade and just terrible terrible purple
- literally cool just like that but then
I am going to go in with the estilo
magnificent metals eyeshadow difference
in the color bronze bell now I thought
this was going to be a lot warmer than
it is so I'll show you what it looks
like just on its own but for me I wanted
it to be this bronzer color so I'm just
going to be exactly what I did gradual
on a change so I'm just going to use
this and listed just where we placed
that color tattoo see it was just a bit
too just like silvery for me and I
wanted it to be like super warm
and fire it so while that's still a
little bit wet I'm going to go in with
this pigment and this is from that
Peters makeup and is in the color Wow
and I'm just going to press that
literally on top of that sparkly shadow
you could totally just skip that stealer
step but if one if did give me a good
base but my pigment on top of and - I
just want to do exactly the same just in
case it looked slightly different but
now I'm going to go back in with that
brush lads and rock eyeshadow on and
just make sure everything it's really
like diffused together and I am going to
go back in with that brown shade and
just read cause like in Forster color
but then that is it for the top of the
eye now I'm going to highlight my inner
corner and I always recently underspin
reaching for the highlighted I plan to
use and I use that as my inner cone on
my life so today that is going to be a
mary lou manizer by the balm and i'm
just going to take a little pencil brush
and I don't mean a corner okay I'm now
going to brush away this fallout which
is why it's good if you feel like there
might be a slight risk that you can have
shadow falling out and you've done your
skin first baking is such a good idea
I'm now just going to apply some glue to
my lashes just so when I'm doing
something else this is like getting dry
and tacky and the lashes I'm well
apparently not the lashes I'm using
today are from Lily lashes and they're
in the style lush they're like a winged
out fluttery delicious eyelash
and I'm just gonna apply some glitter
and the bandit this one is actually
quite thin it's still black but it's
thin so I feel confident and wearing
them without any eyeliner but obviously
you could add eyeliner if you aren't
confident applying eyelashes but these
ones are really really nice and super
lightweight so I'm just going to apply
glue while that is a drying I'm just
going to go ahead and apply it somewhere
then you're going to go ahead and apply
mascara to my top lashes and I'm using
the Maybelline Angels Angels filthy
push-up one I love this one I'm only
going to be doing a light coat just
because of super wearing brushes then
I'm going to apply one of the Marc
Jacobs highliners and this is in the
color Rococo and you can see it's like a
really gorgeous soft brownie color and
just going to run that in my waterline
three puffs and smoke that out I'm going
to take this Anastasia Beverly Hills I
shadow and it's fudge it is such a
gorgeous dark brown and it's got a
really nice warm undertone to it which
for me is perfect you're going to bring
out the blue in my eyes so I'm gonna use
a really small pencil brush and just
press that into the lash line going like
backwards and forwards then as I get to
here I'm almost going to like go
underneath where we've just put that
shadow almost creating like a dark smoky
lower wing and now I'm going to take
that brush that originally had the
chickadee trade on and again it dunk my
brush in captivity and the Morocco shade
but like so lightly and just use that to
release smoke and buff that out
underneath like that now I can pop that
rush of yes and then while that's drying
I'm just going to apply bottom lash
mascara so they're just like the
finished eye makeup complete
which I love like you guys honestly
looking at their singing
that is a great your eyes I'm feeling
really really happy with it and now I'm
going to go ahead and do my eyebrows and
the day I'm going to be mixing it the
soft brandy from Anastasia Beverly Hills
and the ganja problem
because I used to blonde one towards the
front and then the soft brown one
towards the tail so it's a bit more of a
good darker pigmented color where I'm
extending it and then I sculpt them out
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
concealer in 1.5 and that just kind of
gives me a really nice highlight and
then we can set them in place so it just
sets that in a place I'm going to use
the benefit three deep brown tones in
the shade to it just to make sure one
doesn't budge and two gives me like a
little lighter 3d more hell am I saying
like finish I don't know that very word
but just like when the light hits it
this is look a bit fuller so that is the
eyes and eyebrows finish and now we can
make back onto the skin why did I say
it's so much current so now I can brush
a were this big as well save the bronzer
say I'm taking this one up from a fusion
at Beauty add in the color radiance it's
got a really gorgeous like glow to it
and it's not too Brown or too orange so
I really like this line I never reach
for it and I saw it in my collection I
was like you know what I know we're up
today because essentially was just using
this to set that kind of creamy contour
that we put in place okay if you guys
saw on my snapchat I loved this book at
the moment is from Milani and is in the
color Dolce pink it's like the most
gorgeous rose gold color this is not as
rose gold as the luminous I wanted to
custodian or of a pink undertone which
weirdly is really liking at the moment
and the finish of these blushes are so
gorgeous they're like bait they put a
good really nice glow to them but
speaking of glow I'm going to go in and
use the Mary eminence block the mary lou
manizer by the balm I'm going to take my
a sage reveals brush - April I this
so that is the scanner finish now and
now we can move on to the lips finally
and for dying to take the colour-pop
lippie pencil in Boystown i think this
is one of them new ones it just or they
are coming out with like new nude shades
and this one is like this oh my god this
one is like one of my faves you'll be
able to see on it well if it's like a
cool tone ooh which is perfect if you
love to over line your lips like I do
and these are actually some of the
creamiest lip pencils I've used like
they just go on so easily
so once you've aligned the lips I'm
going to go in and fill them with
different from a pur cosmetics it is
their liquid lipstick I think it's
called it's either called obey or obeyed
they've like printed something over it
so I can't really even see but it's
slightly more of a darker nudes and I'm
usually wherever I want we have like a
dark matte nude today which just kind of
unlikely normally it's like a pale
glossy nude funny pinky then I thought
but I'm kind of feeling it I'm now going
to go ahead and use the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray just to lock
everything in place and then we can move
on to hair so this is the finished
makeup look something I am super happy
with I love the eyes so much I think
that's so pretty
using some new products with new
techniques like having angry darks make
that lower lash line I've been loving
that and then study more of a media pink
lips yeah now we can move on to the hair
so for hair I'm going to be using my
Bellamy 6 in-1 curling wand and this is
the largest barrel that they have I
think I think I want to go for like
beachy waves and then I might have like
it hot up half down so to prep my hair
while the colors are heating up I just
take a tiny tiny tiny bit of this
Shermer oil and it says protection oil
it's like a ppppp sized amount and just
run it through and like rub it into my
hands first
now I concentrate it mainly like through
my hair and like the ends of my hair and
honestly I have like the driest hair
because my
since it'll work with bleach and all
that stuff and I've noticed such a
difference with desc
so I'm just running it through this also
makes it really Microsoft is love it
really helps to nourish like the tips
and the ends of your hair so I'm just
going to go ahead and then tie or just
clip actually
kusers of my hair up you guys know the
drill with this so I'm then going to
take like medium sized calculate this
and go outwards for the first one hold
it for like 10 seconds maybe because I
put on quite a high heat like so and
then for the next one I'm going to curl
it in words and just alternating each
time like inwards and outwards just kind
of give you a bit more volume and a bit
more beachy and then once I've done my
whole hair like that
I'll be back to the toilet because you
just want to keep like repeating that
process
so I'm just on the third and final layer
so I'm just beginning to curl it
outwards I don't need to do about three
layers just because I have not that
thick and but I want there to be like
sufficient amount of curls on each layer
so three is normally about enough for me
all like medium for those trunks and
then this column turning inwards at the
last time I curled it outwards I always
do the final one like away from my face
so once is all curled I don't just
whoopsie we'll take all the other layers
out so it looks like this and then I'm
just going to go ahead and spray it with
some a hand fray I'm expecting you to
drop a little bit but I do like to spray
with hairspray now and this is just
spray and play big sexy hair hairspray
you know I actually think I might leave
it like that and now I will show you
what I'm wearing okay so here's a little
overview of my outfit I'm really because
what I actually wanted to wear I didn't
arrive I wanted to like a black and red
texture but if that does arrive by the
time I film this that is probably what I
will wear as you're probably feeling
Instagram or something but for now I'm
just going to use this instead so I'm
wearing this t-shirt from misguided
that's got like a plunging cutout and
like a choker and this will be included
on my whole on Thursday is so stay tuned
for that I've got some silver hoop
earrings to wear as well I've also got
just some a plain black leggings these
are from a collie and they're like
double in sickness so they're super
flattering and really really comfortable
as well and then you're not going to get
those like visual pant lines I'm going
to wear my big red puffy coat I can
always just ditch what I like sitting
down and then I've got my Yeezy boosts
and these are the red and a black one
selfie you do tell I was going to like a
red and vaccine somehow because my sharp
in their eyes this is what I've come up
with so I'm going to pop that all on and
I will show you so this is everything
complete I really hope you guys like
this look like a casually concert vibe
out there optional and I wanted but
still I love it all
