today I have created this easy
effortless kind of winter glam makeup
look and I'm not wearing any thick
lashes which is a massive shocker
considering I always do and that's
because today's video is in
collaboration with Maybelline and is
actually inspired by this picture of
Gigi Hadid for the falsies and gellick
lash campaign which is kind of the main
feature of this video is mainly the eyes
as you can see I've just got a bold
winged liner going on and mascara really
it's super easy to create and with this
mascara especially it creates really
fluttery angelic lashes so who needs
falsies for everyday anyway as I said
this video is Incorporation with
Maybelline's - all the products used off
from there and i have linked them down
below if you guys are interested in
getting them as well - if you like the
look of it this easy everyday a makeup
as you'll soon find out then please keep
watching
okay to begin I'm gonna start off with
my base and a little bit of color coding
because recently I found I've got a bit
of redness around here and a bit down
here so for that I'm gonna use my master
camo concealer palette it comes with a
green shade which is perfect canceling
out redness as you guys know I'm just
gonna dab that in the areas that I find
to get like the most pigmentation of
color just blend them out
I'm just gonna take this shade here
which is of a peachy undertone and what
this is gonna do is really help or
brighten up underneath my eyes and
cancel out any darkness so this palette
is really handy because all the colors
are kind of like in one place you have
to keep using different products and
they're all super lightweight but like
have a really good coverage at the same
time that makes sense
I find just kind of like pressing it
into your skin it's the most effective
way so I like to avoid creasing and
stuff and you're kind of just like
creating this canvas for yourself over
your skin you've got like all that your
patches but doing this beforehand just
kind of make means that you'd have to
apply minimal product on top so it's
super lightweight and easy kind of like
for everyday I'm just going to use my
sponge to kind of press the excess into
my skin
look so then I'm gonna go into the
foundation and for that I'm gonna use
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
in the shade 220 you guys know this
Maybelline foundation is literally one
of my face it has like a medium to full
coverage but I feel like you use a
sponge and only really use a little bit
is perfect for everyday in the sense
that it's a matte finish and things with
a matte finish tend to last the longest
and that's why I was I think it's
probably perfect for winter as well
because you know you can get like really
flustered in the winter time it can
cause you to like sweat and stuff even
though it's cold so I find having a
matte foundation really kind of
withstands that and I'm just gonna kind
of dab this in the areas particularly
over the top of the green concealer
cause you don't want the green to come
through but not necessarily over the top
I would just put the concealer just kind
of like avoid it getting too thick or
anything like that and plus Gigi's skin
in the photo where the kind of look is
inspired from her skin just kind of
looked really effortlessly flawless so
we don't need too much product to
achieve that if there are areas that
like you want to kind of add extra
coverage to I feel like just only really
concentrate that in those areas or maybe
use the concealer to do so you're so not
like putting loads of stuff on your face
from the inspired picture and just kind
of a preferred look of mine she was
really like bright underneath the eyes
so I'm gonna go in with the concealer
palette again and take this shade here
which is the lightest one I'm just gonna
lightly dab that in like an upside down
a triangle to really brighten up
underneath my eye like I said I think
applying lots of little layers is kind
of the most effective way to kind of
make your makeup last longer and without
it feeling too thick and cakey I plus I
feel like it's much quicker as well than
applying loads of product to your face
and then having to blend it out for ages
and then just blending it with my sponge
these concealers I find this little
every like maybe Lincoln so they blend
so easily
into the skin I find when things are too
like thick they just cling I'm now gonna
go ahead and set that with powder and
then I will be like that I feel like in
the winter time you don't need a huge
amount of product on your cheek because
you get such a natural flash from the
cold anyway brand in the photo GG didn't
really have a lot of stuff on her cheek
age either but she does have a nice soft
bronze contour going on so for that I'm
gonna take this Maybelline bronzer it is
their Maybelline it face studio and it's
in the shade blondes
zero one so it's like a really light
color and it comes with a really
gorgeous like hygeia blush bronze type
thing as well so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that bronzer on my brush
and just kind of give me a soft bronze
look I really love this because I
thought you can be quick with it because
it doesn't pick up too much product and
it's a really light color so it's quite
hard to go like overboard so if you're
in like a rush and you just need quick
every day like I said this is a really
good bronzer for that and it's not too
warm tone either it's of that of that
like olive quality which I really like
in a bronzer now to get that kind of
gorgeous winter blow I'm gonna take the
new Maybelline it's strobing liquid this
one is in the color medium nude you guys
know I'm obsessed with the Maybelline
strobe stick and this is no exception I
love a liquid highlighter and this one
like is the most gorgeous bronzy rosy
glow which I always think could double
up especially in this shade as a debris
of gorgeous shimmery a plushy glowy type
thing so a perfect winter perfect for
that quick flush glow look the way I
like to apply it is super quick super
easy just put it on the back of my hand
and then take my finger to warm it up
slightly and then just dab it onto the
skin
I feel like this kind of skin routine
that I'm doing here is literally like
one of my everyday skin routine so I
think it's super quick super easy I've
really not put a lot of product in my
face either and everything I've put on I
know it's gonna last a long time and
it's gonna give me like a read healthy
glow using a liquid highlighter as well
I think looks better throughout the day
so this is a like I said one of my fave
kind of things to do with my skin in the
winter time so that is literally the
skin complete super quick and easy like
I said but again she didn't look like
she was wearing much in our skin I think
this is kind of a perfect skin routine
for those that need to be quick but put
together and once it makes super
effortless and easy I'm now gonna go
ahead and do it one eye and then I will
come back and show you how I did it so
this eye look is super easy to do and it
just looks really put together but I'm
literally using like one eye shadow and
it's more lash and line of focus which I
feel creates that more effortless
angelic look and this is why I think
it's perfect for everyday and for those
of you that need to look put together
really quickly so on my eye I am taking
the Maybelline's the nude palette and
literally gonna take this shade here in
the crease I'm just gonna buff that back
and forth kind of winged out slightly
because I'm going to be doing a winged
liner so I kind of want this shape to
follow too and also in that picture of
Gigi it really doesn't look as if she's
very much eye shadow at all so it's
perfect for those of you that maybe I'll
compliment eyeshadow still want to look
put together and this palettes really
like a good day to night palette as well
in the sense that I'm using this look an
everyday look
but there's colors in there that would
allow me to transition it into something
a bit more smokey dramatic if I wanted
to
you're just buffing that back and forth
into the crease literally that's gonna
be it for the crease color on the lid
I'm gonna take this Maybelline tattoo in
the shade of breathless cream eyeshadows
I think are the perfect product if you
need to be quick but still look like you
made an effort and stuff just because
they lost a long time especially these
hence the name color tattoo like it
literally doesn't come off they do so
many different colors you guys know I
love the crammed nude and creme de Rose
ones for when I'm doing like glam looks
they match my skin color but this breast
in the shade has a pretty after this
angel asked glow to it it's a really
nice shimmery champagne close you'll see
I'm literally gonna place that all over
my lid and just kind of drift it into my
crease color these shimmery color
tattoos make a really a good base if you
want to put like a pigment on the top
all again I shadow on the top but on
their own as well they are just as
beautiful and I think you could apply
this with your finger as well if you're
not like as advanced with brushes or
anything then from the same palette I'm
just gonna take the lightest shade here
and just apply that in my inner corner
to your Breton on my eye before we do
our eyeliner and then just finally
quickly going back in with that crease
color again I'm just gonna take a small
pencil brush and run that along my lower
lash line I'm gonna connect it back out
to the winged shadow that we've just
done now for the winged eyeliner I'm
going to take the Maybelline precise
liner to do this in black and the pen
has like quite a long lip as you can see
which has a really defined point that
makes it so much easier going into the
inner corner you guys know I love this
already from the photo Gigi looked as if
she had quite like a big wing going on
but obviously tailored this to how you
want and you can be like a small one or
whatever I think just adding a wing if
you've got quite a basic ocean it makes
it look as if you put in way more effort
than you have I always like to do is my
eyes open and do the top first just so I
can create the thickness and I have
something to connect the wing back to
like that you could just leave it there
but like I said in the picture Gigi has
this gorgeous wing and I love a good
wing and especially like I said if I've
got minimal eye shadow on I think it
makes such a difference so I'm just
gonna kind of follow the natural line of
like my brow per se and where we'd put
the eye shadow and just tug on my skin a
little bit and do lots of little motions
like so then looking down just kind of
going about a centimetre back and
connect it back up practice makes
perfect with winged liner guys but I
think using a pen if you're not
competent with gel it's like the next
best thing and especially using a pen
that doesn't drag makes things easier
once you're happy with the size of your
wing you can go on to apply mascara so
this is kind of like the start of the
video start the show because it's the
whole @gg look as she is one of the
Maybelline ambassadors is from the
campaign for the falsies push-up angel
mascara you guys know I normally love
lashes but for everyday sometimes they
can be a bit much but when you still
want to have that false lash effect it
is important that you're using the
bright mascara this mascara has three
kind of like the main features and they
are all kind of in the brush as well as
something like an amazing formula and
stuff you can see this has more of a
comb style so that allows you to comb it
nearly like every lash grab them allows
you to kind of like really wiggle at the
root of the lash as well and build up
the kind of effect that you want and
make your lashes look more flattering
and angelic and give you that kind of a
fluffy effect which I love in a mascara
it doesn't pick up too much product
either because it has a curved head this
is also makes it so much easier as it
hugs the lash line so you can wing your
lashes out as well from side to side and
we're gonna make your eyes look bigger
and I always find you know mascaras that
they say that they're gonna give you
volume but their answer to volume is
like a really massive chunky brush this
one is super narrow and this means I'm
not going to get that like black dot in
the middle like there's no chance of me
making that sort of mistake I'm just
gonna go ahead and start at the root and
like wiggle upwards you can see it
really kind of combs through and gets
like all the mini ones trust me and
someone that has short stumpy lashes and
is addicted to wearing false lashes this
gives so much length and like separation
because I really personally don't like
the appearance of clumpy lashes I think
if you're just gonna wear masks are you
want them to look fluttery separated
really widen up your eye do you see that
and on the bottom as well the curved
head this makes it so much easier
like not transfer down like the product
to transfer down and it really gets with
your little lashes you can see my lash
is super separated super fluttery and
wispy no falsies and I think this is
kind of perfect to create that kind of
effortless angelic everyday makeup and
we literally used barely any products at
all and it still looks pretty put
together I'd say by literally the eyes
complete and now we can move on to the
lips so onto the lips I think for
everyday you definitely can't go wrong
with a nude and also obviously in the
campaign picture Gigi is wearing the
most gorgeous rosy nude so for that I'm
gonna take the IDI and Maybelline Color
drama lip contour kit this is in the
shade that blushed a bombshell so it
comes with a gorgeous range of rosy nude
shades so perfect for like that everyday
look and it also comes with a primer and
highlighter as well and that primer is
going to help nourish your lips and make
the lip product last a lot longer
and the highlighter I love to put like
you guys know in my Cupid's bow make
your lips look a bit fuller so it
actually separates into a line shade
range and a color shade range and the
little brush that comes with it is
actually really good and you can line
your lips using one of these colors and
then fill using one of those I
definitely prefer a more of like a a
brownie nude on myself so I'm going to
take the top two colors line with this
and fill in with this but first of all
I'm gonna apply the primer to my lips
because I think in like the winter as
well lips can just get so dry it's
actually just going to take that on my
finger
I'm just gonna get a good base for unlit
products as well then it taking the
smaller end of the brush then I take the
top liner color so more of their
brownian nude shade also if you find
pencils to kind of tug on your skin this
is probably a pretty good product for
you as well because lining with creams
is so much easier once you're done
lining obviously it's time to fill them
and then I'm gonna take like I said that
top color here I lift quite like a
natural lip color as well then again on
my finger I'm gonna take that high that
cream highlighter just kind of press it
into the top of my lip and on my Cupid's
bow just to lighten it fluffy and create
that kind of fuller look and a bit more
of a softer angelic lip too so this is
the finished makeup look I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video you guys
know I love a full glam so I definitely
wanted to do an easy everyday and look
that still looks put together minimal
product only mascara on the eyes
especially this one I feel like it just
creates such a gorgeous fluttery lash
and for people like me that have really
short lashes and kind of struggle just
to wear mascara on their own as the
perfect brush to separate and give
amazing volume and length kind of just
gives me the confidence just to whack on
a winged liner and mascara and still
feel like I look really put together
which I love and is amazing I've left
