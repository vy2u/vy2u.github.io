today I thought I would film a kind of
go to look that I'd like to work when
I'm going out coming I actually am I'm
literally going out in about 15 minutes
so I filmed this for you guys so I hope
you guys enjoyed it if you guys don't
like a lot of makeup then you're gonna
hate this video because when I'm going
out I like to layer it on it's just the
kind of makeup that I like to wear you
guys can just watch this while you're
getting ready to do your own thing or if
you like this kind of look you guys can
do it too I know a lot of you guys say
in the comments below that I don't need
this much makeup but I don't work
because I need it I kind of work because
I want to but yeah so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up if you do and let's get started hey
guys so I'm literally getting ready with
you I'm in my dressing yarn and I am
going out after this so this will be a
look probably posted on Instagram by the
time you've seen this tonight so to
start off with I'm going to be applying
a lot of makeup like I probably already
said in the intro so I've moisturize my
face using the using the only two in one
radiant glow and hydration moisturizer
and I've already gone ahead and done at
my eyebrows using my anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow in medium brown and just
kind of highlighted underneath my brow
bone using the NYX wonder pencil like I
normally do everyone does their eyebrows
differently so I never really like to
include that but I will do an updated
Brad tutorial if you want to or I did
say a while ago I was going to do a
tutorial on like my daytime and like
going out to eyebrow routines that I do
cuz one requires a lot more effort than
the other so I still might do that one
but I'm now gonna go ahead and do one
eye because I'm a bit I'm sure of how
I'm gonna have my makeup so I'm gonna
play around and then I will be back to
show you how I do the other eye okay so
this is a look that I went for obviously
it's warm it's winged its smoky it's my
favorite kind of look for going out so
yeah I'm gonna go ahead and show you how
I did it so I've already gone ahead and
primed my eye with concealer and set it
with a powder then I'm taking the many
MUA palette which I got recently if you
guys saw my sister nap shot you know
that it came smashed but I fixed it so
all's good
I'm gonna take this shade here and mix
it with this one and just pop it into my
socket so I a hundred percent always do
my eyeshadow first if I'm going out just
because when I'm getting ready to go out
is when I'm the most stressed more prone
to make mistakes so this way I'm not
going to ruin my skin makeup if I ruin
like my liner or my shadow or like
something goes wrong then I'm going in
with this one here which is just kind of
slightly darker than this one to further
deepen up my socket as per usual just
placing this slightly lower than the
shadow to create that kind of gradient
smokey effect
then that's my lid shade it's obviously
going to be something bronzy and sparkly
so I'm taking this pigment from peaches
makeup in the shade Wow their pigments
on the tree incredible I don't if you
guys have tried them right they're like
a boutique brand making them at me from
like Manchester Liverpool or like
something and their makeup is just
phenomenal I always post about their
stuff so you guys haven't already
checked them out you should I'm just
going to be tapping that onto my eyelid
then I'm just going to go back in with
the slightly darker brown shade and just
blend that back into my socket to make
sure the crease color and the lid color
kind of trim blend together
then I actually am gonna add a bit of
glitter this is the makeup geek sparkler
in asteroid and I'm going to be placing
a bit of the Mac liquid eyeliner mixing
medium onto my lid first as a bit of an
adhesive so I'm just going to use this
concealer brush and just press it onto
my lid basically where I put the pigment
around the glitter to go and then press
the glitter on top I always look down
while doing this so I don't get any
transfer now I'm just going to go in
with these babe which one these two
shades mixed together to further deepen
up the socket again this looks kind of
more popular than I usually do but I've
been really lucky now at the moment
because sunset I am literally in love
with this palette like a cat then
obviously I'm gonna take my white and
clean up the edge and all see they go to
that fell down on my eye again another
reason why doing your eye makeup before
your face makeup is always a good idea
like so then I'm going to go ahead and
do my chili now I've tried to do this so
so so many times on camera and I always
just end up going so much further down
so I'm gonna go ahead and do this off
camera but if you guys really really
really want to see an update to eyeliner
tutorial give this video a thumbs up and
let me know in the comments below and I
will do that for you so liner done I'm
moving back onto the eyes I'm going to
take this dark purple from the same
money MUA palette and use that to really
deepen up and define my eye socket so
I'm gonna take a little flat brush like
this I'm just kind of work it in to the
crease really kind of only concentrating
on the like outer portion like that and
then going back in with a fluffy brush
that we used earlier not picking up any
excess product or anything and they're
just kind of popping that in so there's
no harsh lines then I'm going back in
with the wipe again and go stop see I
also highlighted my inner corner with
the really really light color from the
mani palette to then I'm gonna go ahead
and apply mascara this is the L'Oreal
scope mascara and then the lashes I'm
going to be applying other blinking a
few lashes in Samantha which are my
absolute favorites for going out at the
moment they're like the perfect winged
fluttery lash so I'm just gonna go ahead
and do that now I've stuck my lashes on
and now I'm moving on to the skin I've
just primed my skin using the natural
radiance primer from Mac then it's my
skin I'm obviously using mine Giorgio
Armani foundation in the shade 6.5 and
I'm mixing it a tiny bit with matte
stick near my mac studio fix fluid in
the shade NC 37 now guys I am a lot
darker on here so I know I always say
this every time but someone always calls
me out on it it is a bit of a
transformation but they just don't want
to put town on my face so it's gonna
look different
okay
couple opposed to that couple of dabs
into me fix fluid I'm gonna learn of you
the reason I mix them together is
because the color of the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk it's more to the color of
my turn
and the fix fluid it's kind of like a
bit more of a yellow a base to it and
also fix fluid if you guys have used
that foundation no it's more of a matte
finish in it for me it lasts like so
long on my skin so it's kind of like a
really good one for going out but I
don't like to just use fix fluid I think
it's a bit too yellow for me so I like
to mix it one up then I'm taking my
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer in the
shade like warm still my all-time
favorite concealer ever just applying
that under the eyes you know the drill
down bit aminos forehead chin Cupid's
bow I do like to take a little brush
like this before I blend it in pick up a
bit of that excess concealer that and
just use it just underneath the wing
just to tidy it up so I don't have to
try and do that with the sponge
then going in with my trusty Real
Techniques sponge and just blending it
out like so and then recently to set my
under eyes I'm actually sometimes I
cream contour sometimes I don't today
I'm not going to kind of been liking a
different method but to set my under
eyes I've been really liking mixing my
shit if it's powder in NZ 30 and my
hourglass ambient lighting powder
together just boom this sometimes when I
set my under eyes just with the ambient
lighting powder and then I go out if I
need to touch up a lot more like
frequently and then it can be a bit too
bright and then using the NZ 31 kind of
helps to tone down the kind of
brightness of the concealer so I like to
mix them together and then I just take
the Studio Fix powder out with me I'll
get my clutch to touch up with I just
press it into the skin not drag because
you don't want to move any of the fluids
around on the skin
moving on to bronzer recently I've been
really liking kind of like layering my
bronzer I know this is a lot of makeup
this is just what I like when I go out
please don't tell me I already know so I
like to take a really massive fluffy
brush and then this mineralized
skinfinish from Mac in the shade medium
tan and just kind of really go home and
use this as my initial it's like a
transition shade that I would use in the
crease let's start with the light one
and then I'll go darker so I'm using a
big fluffy brush and just kind of
placing that only cheekbones you can see
it just have really softly bronze as the
skin tops with me forward obviously you
stop there that's enough bronzer for you
toss this around enough for me so I'm
taking the next one which is a
mineralized skinfinish in dark golden so
it's just slightly darker on a bit more
of a smaller denser brush I'm going to
kind of use this to contour but I am
still kind of buffing it upwards and
like bronzing up my skin being a bit
more like hounded with it as well and a
bit more precise with my
movements these men and I skin finishes
make like the nicest bronzers ever you
know there's like give me some and stuff
I know these ones are kind of one of the
face part of shades but they work as
bronzers then I'm going to lightly
contour using Mac harmony brush up on a
little contour brush don't know why I
just said brush like that but I think
I'm oh god guys when I'm drunk I'm out I
do like every accent Under the Sun did
you ever meet me what I'm out and I'm
talking to you an accident you don't
think it's me actually is I just just
shot a lot of shit nothing too heavy
just like that then I'm taking honeymoon
blusher from makeup geek
then it's a highlight I am taking
champagne a pop get their nose be fuck
it let's put it everywhere and then once
I've done my skin that's what I normally
move back onto my eyes so what I like to
do is just take a warm shadow so I'm
going to take this middle one here and
grab a pencil brush and then just run
that along my lower lash line and then
apply mascara this L'Oreal Scot mascara
is phenomenal on the bottom lashes
moving on to lips I'm taking my duck my
adult JK a pencil from Kylie cosmetics
and just lining my lips with it
you see ya and I'm ready to go jorts
then I'm gonna take the Too Faced melted
lipstick and melted sugar obviously then
I'm going to use the dose of colors
undressed lip gloss on the top and nice
the finished makeup look so I'm going to
go ahead and do my hair and put my up on
and I'll be back to show you the
finished result so I've just cut my hair
and kind of that puts my loops in and
I'm wearing a what do you suit from
Windsor store I've won this millions of
times and you guys already support on my
Instagram but yeah so I'm gonna go out
