let's begin I'm literally just in
addressing y'all my hair is a air-dried
for the mess and for looking great based
keep it that's all about to change and
y'all about to change we've already gone
ahead and done my eyebrows and I was
left the links to I've use it down below
it is my to get brows from Anastasia
Beverly Hills in a soft brown and blonde
I like to sew it in place recently with
the makeup Ella brow gel in the shade 25
yeah like I said I'm now he's going to
go ahead and prime my eyes we are going
to do a wing dip so I'm going to go
ahead and do my eyes first this time and
just going to use the concealer but I'm
going to use on my face and then I'm
also going to use they're just kind of a
scuff out my eyebrows lamp
I literally always love to use my
concealer and the primaries are so good
and it normally why I'm getting ready on
a hundred percent play music but
obviously you can't do that on YouTube
because of copyright reasons please go
up called Ellie Rennell suggest that I
leave my Spotify playlist down below so
I have done that you guys interested in
the kind of music that I listen to like
while I get ready and just like in
general if you think that we have the
same kind of music taste so once I times
night I'm just going to go ahead and
just set it in case with powder because
I feel
that just makes everything so much
easier when you blending your eyeshadow
I wonder if I'll see any of you guys
tomorrow or let me know in the comments
down below and if you already went to
like a race or something like what you
guys will click with like inspiration
flying next have like random events and
surfing and anyway moving on to the eyes
I'm going into an older favorite this is
the model of the new songs ballads from
Anastasia Beverly Hills while Ivy's that
burnt-orange kind of massively I am just
going to get use the burnt orange color
on a big fluffy brush and just blend
that in to the crease the initial
transition color oh my god I have to
turn my phone off to film and I'm
sweating at salute buckets I'm not even
kidding
only what am I going on board but I'm
also let me know in the comments down
below I did quite a big clothes order
from like misguided and pretty little
saying all for like my holiday but I
brought coming out because I'm going to
meet with my friends in it July and I've
also going into Paris and September 1
general French French err trips which
would be cool I also have a couple of
events and stuff coming out said let me
know because of what like a massive
apology heading an accessory to all
because I think I have done a day of
shopping recently and I haven't done a
curtain wall in artsy ages so yeah let
me know in the comments down at the
lorry I don't want to go too dark on the
crease in it so I'm just going to take
that a real girl cut out just tear my
dress as you'll see I would have seen in
the intro is like a baby blue so I was
like oh god I don't know what
accessories and I can't have my major
because initially it was this lush pink
to peace and I had like some rose gold
accessories but then I don't know if you
guys like them to ask or or ever there
is quite formal I just have felt like I
looks like I was going to my local club
a little bit but I obviously look
sophisticated but it was anything like
or perform line I'm still not going
proper formal way so this outfit changes
like a better option I think it's a bit
more sophisticated in something like
would I wouldn't wear out maybe I'll
include it or maybe I'll do like a
clubbing get ready of me and I'll wear
that outfit so you guys can see like
what maybe go
one okay I'm going to leave that for the
crease colors from now and now we're
going to move on it to lid color I'm
going to use this pigment from it next
it gorgeous like orange color I
definitely kind of wanted it to be like
an orangey theme because that's all see
what I love doing the most but also
orange is a really complementary color
of blue and also the dress that I'm
wearing is blue and also I've got a
scarf that kind of has all these kind of
colors on its muscle it will tie in
together in 92 that worked out well
didn't it almost suggests fine clown did
I literally plan my whole outfit around
the make up I want to wear like somehow
I'll find a way to make it learn I'm
just applying the NYX NYX and
multitasker little base which is such a
good product to pigment glitchy
everything just clings through when you
put it on the top so I'm just placing
that on to my lid and then just taking
this pigment I think it was called
Shanghai Sun oh god I literally this is
so long in it I literally forget have
done is such a gorgeous like apricot tea
oranjee color yes pretty right don't I
mean I become this is who I'm actually
kind of scared how drunk I would be
tomorrow I am awful at pacing myself
because normally the drinks that I buy
are like alcoholic but they just taste
so good and then I kind of forget that
there are both and I'm just drinking it
like it's juice and before you know I've
only been at like 45 minutes and
something mmm I mean they're home and
when I've got to go I've actually got to
go some people can just take a tactical
Chan and continue whereas I just get to
the point where I've got like fall
asleep so hoping that doesn't happen
tomorrow and I do pick myself so if I
don't paint myself I'm going to let
tweet like a cryptic message
I'll just tweet peaches maybe and then
that's when you know like oh my god
let's make that how long I'll be able to
know how long my feet will last it
another thing I'm terrified walks
probably not very long as well it
literally doesn't even matter what shoes
I wear I always seem to pick the most
painful one and I'm always going to take
my shoes off stuff 12 yeah actually I
actually think I'm going to bring like
slaps within like my food bag or
something so I have something to change
in jail because I know males are crying
and over
everyone Guntur may not be actually
crying but I'll just stop pissing around
off okay
go anywhere is my sweet huh but now I
just came back and with that real burger
color and just diffusing the line
between the pigment and like we're
obviously put that color before but now
I've got it on I do think I'm going to
deepen it with the dark brown in the
palette just because I wanted a little
bit more depth yeah yeah I'm going to
take this dark brown hair called it
Cyprus umber I'm actually going to mix
it with the red ochre as well you know
that like burnt red color that's in
there and then just buff that on the
outer most part it's kind of I love
doing your eyes ice you can literally be
a mess if you want and I know I'm going
to wipe it away in about three to one
even just going back in with the fluffy
brush and buffing get in soon
yes enough whoa now I'm just going to
wipe away at the edges but oh my god I'm
assuming most of you I'm watching love
island like I like that for little
garlic bitch y'all I've been it like so
many meetings this week and then we took
business or just whatever and then
suddenly it's like oh my god said you in
watching live Ireland and that's what we
end up talking about for the majority of
the time but I was saying like I feel
like every year and I'm always yourself
it will never compare to last year where
Big Sam I won't get into it
why don't you episodes then I'm like oh
my god I'm constantly tweeting about em
silly but really involved you remember
they do that episode where there's a
webbing I'm just highlighting my inner
corner with vara Mia but my Madoka
episode rate gets tools to end and then
it's like a talent show and I was just
thinking of that oh man I wonder what
everyone's times gonna be like obviously
more people going to come in and all
this my stuff is like people might go
but just like spacing on the people that
are there now I but Amber's a dance
driven teacher she definitely done I
thought Olivia kind of did like she
could maybe sing I don't know like or
maybe I saw Camilla could sing and then
we joked because you know Camilla's job
is a really fancy like dissembling those
explosives and stuff imagine if it was
like oh she's got 30 seconds till I've
dissembled as explosive or it's going to
dip like blop
a magic act I mean but when those people
get timed to do a great dangerous stuff
I their particular black circle about me
laughing an area the ami highest mind my
inner corner is sufficiently highlighted
I'm now going to go ahead and do the
winged liner with my NYC liquid liner
I'm going to skip through this a little
bit just because one I really really
need to put the fan on and just like
cool down for a sec and two I can never
sit in the screen I always just get
lower lower and lower and you guys knit
it as a crucial step everyone needs to
take a deep breath and precautions with
so I'm going to take my time I'll be
right I mean so I've just gone ahead and
done at my wing and kind of tried to
cool down slowly so now I'm just gonna
apply mascara and falsies and for that
I'm going to use it the Maybelline at
Big Shot gloss on the scar and how
amazing are these IATA these are from
earlier that in the style opulent and
they're just so wings out and wispy and
stuff so again I'm going to go ahead and
do that because this just like stuff you
don't need it looks real quick but yeah
I'm going to go ahead and do that and
show you I'm just I'm you know you're so
excited about has lash line cuz you like
its we're just going to complete
everything for me so you get a kind of
big but like sinan big so you're still
gonna be able to see why blonde on the
ice so yeah I'm going to do that and
then I'll be back again and I promise ya
how amazing are these eyelashes they
were literally easiest the last man is
so thin and so sex was so easy to apply
it but they're like so mink so you've
always been scared is like this the
minke issue King lashes because the sick
lash line definitely try these out I've
left them at links down below now we are
going to move on to the skin so first
things first I am going to spray my face
with six-plus to give me a little bit of
hydration and kind of calm me down again
slightly and then for moisturizer I was
really loving the Charlotte Toby magic
cream so I'm going to go ahead and apply
that it's not too oily but doesn't leave
too much of like a residue so I've been
really liking this underneath my makeup
I mean if you've applied six plus you
don't necessarily need a moisturize but
I just find almost absorbs smoothness to
your higher face you know god it really
makeup even going to stay on in this
heat like for real girl I've got sweat
coming from every crevice the primer I'm
going to take the immediate post shave
balm this
never let some down and the primer and
it is so good it's like literally my
makeup please whenever I wear this and
it feels really like cooling on my skin
as well I'm using a lot of pipes I feel
if I'm going to keep me fresh and
hydrated but I just like to apply it
with a brush you guys know learn all the
way around honey
okay once we have timed our skin I'm
going to go ahead and do a foundation
and I've been really reaching for my
George Armani luminous silk again Vichy
like I have used it for ages because
I've been trying and testing out so many
different ones but this one just
literally it never lets me down for
event I think it looks so good in
fiction it's not too broad coverage I'd
say it's more like a medium to a
buildable coverage oh yeah you could
definitely build this up to be a full
coverage one but yeah I literally hadn't
used it and so long and then it last
week dinner'll well I really miss it and
I keep seeing pictures of like people
using it on Instagram and their skin is
just always flawed or something I'm sure
a little bit 'space tuning helped a
little there but this honestly is such a
gorgeous foundation I always always
always rave about it sorry guys just
having a fan and head up moment I don't
want me to like get the end of this
tutorial
almost like I step down 360 my makeup
safety all off so so good okay so if we
can see that I'm going to take the Attar
shape deep difference in the color light
neutral it is still not tried shape tape
you have got to like go where the hell
have you been
because this is the concealer of life I
kind of want to put up right under I do
feel like that does look better in
pictures personally for me anyway
because I like to cream contour and all
that jazz so this one is going to help
brighten up under literally it's like
airbrushed under there now I always feel
when I find that concealer it just looks
so good and it never creases a freaking
love it really when I'm taking a new
product it is from a Rimmel it is
they're sOooo contour stick in the shade
light I feel like you look like look
there's a dupe for the thing that Kim
Kardashian's come up with and if I had
got Kim Kardashian's ones which I didn't
I should start a comparison video that
would have been a really good I'm just
going to apply
all around and then on my
chinny-chin-chin
now I'm just going to take a zero fiber
fresh and buff that in as well
I said I'd these blend really really
easy they're so cool so if you didn't
get the human ones like me but you're
like in the market for something like
that definitely that they did a good a
few colors as well to hopefully you
should be able to find one that best
suits you oh my god is like I'm
different blends away my like foundation
into my sweat I'm not even kidding but
recently I have had a lot of meetings
with like drugstore brands and staff
that I put so much stuff I could test
out you guys wanted another video of
like the full face of first impressions
like let me know but also just taking
the like light side and just going
underneath that contour and then just
leave my foundation brush to blend that
in and just use up to just sharpen it up
a little bit you know mm-hmm right now
that is all the cream broke so I'm going
to be putting on my face so I'm now just
going to go my go ahead and it set that
with powder and I'm going to put this
panel to this again and we still read
but I'm just gonna go in with the fan on
what I do this because I've got like
sweat and I get it on to put powder on
to the sweat so she's cool and on powder
and then I'll come back amazing so we
are sufficiently all mattified and we'll
see how long that lasts but now I'm
going to go ahead and write bronzer that
I'm gonna TP Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer has it smells like chocolate and
you can so I'm just going on
sorry crap
quick button that's it out before
someone says I'm gonna burn them but I
feel like we've made it work and now
going to apply you guys know it like
this is my favorite product Mac global
glow is just one of those are at
products don't wear every day like on my
skin I just it barely has any kind of
just a tiny sort of ever warm bronze but
it's like gives you that JLo skin I'm
literally fade in it while I wish I
could literally and then it's full
blusher I'm going to take the amok just
a pinch extra dimension at blusher again
such a gorgeous like rosy gold EPG
McCullough and as such a gorgeous signed
the whole actually mention range
literally does and speaking of which I'm
going to take the infamous Mac oh
darling extra dimension highlighter this
is what I think Emily uses all the time
and honestly how highlights like golf
so although we want to be the singing
man yeah I mean use this an agency's a
nice to get how much I love this as well
god original but yeah like I said
today's a day to use all of the products
that make you feel fancy a towel
grandma's house and just snatched I
don't really need to hope my keeper
supposed to mix they've got that natural
glow going on called a Sula so we just
add to it she'll be okay
so that is the kind of skin bit done and
I'm gonna go back and finish and D like
a lower part of the eyes I'm going to
use my one of my favorite pencil to put
my rule scientists if the Marc Jacobs
eyeliner in at sunset it's just such a
gorgeous like orange II bronzy gold and
it but it's not too dark I'll do look a
little closer when eyes are completely
finished but quietly where my favorite
things have you got if you like
something in your waterline but not too
dark result any don't skip to shut and
kind of really compliment your eye color
balance absolutely done but now I'm just
going to get my pencil brush in it to
the burnt orange color from the Emelin
or renaissance palette so basically the
largest one that we wouldn't might be
like is it too dark on the eyes so I'm
just going to use that to us in pretty
much the pencil and connect everything
together and then I can just apply up
caught in my lash mascara and we are
done on the eyes so this is a close-up
of the eyes eye and loved if I did you
haven't done a wing in so long so I'm
really like loving the orange burn boom
Taylor focus totally complements my eye
color so now let's move on to it the lip
now in this combination I've been loving
at the moment is this one day I am going
to go for a new just because I'm gonna
be drinking to rather datum on their
like the easiest colors to top up and
they complement this kind of alert so
I'm using the this is from new look it's
their lip line I think it's called like
nude pink or something I've got I think
they've totally redone their packaging
out so I'll leave it links down below
I've been really loving desert
like a almost velvety of satin lip and
Vietnam velvet what are these called
velvet gliding strips is the most
stunning nude and it's so easy to apply
so comfortable to attract as well so I'm
just going to go and do that because
it's not a liquid lipstick you just work
a little bit harder to like blend out
the lip liner so definitely make sure
your suffering ends you don't want to
look like old school might even go back
in with the pencil and just and then I
am it just and I'm at my cube so again
because I say like Red Lobster come back
so you aren't amazed if so this is like
the finished makeup I've gone full I am
just going to use a chill selling spray
woo to make sure we are locked or in
place now the next thing I'm going to do
is my hair but realistically I literally
just done a couple of hair tutorials and
one of them would be a perfect - this I
am I am actually understand started what
I want to do in my head I think now I'm
just going to really quickly it strain
it so you know sending you the tutorial

I will show you the completed kind of
hair and makeup and then I'll move on to
the outfit which I'm so excited you guys
