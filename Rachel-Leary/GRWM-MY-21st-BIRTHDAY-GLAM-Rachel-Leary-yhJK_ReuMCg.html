today is Friday the 6th October and
it'll be or it is today my 21st birthday
so happy birthday to anyone else if it's
your birthday today as well so today's
videos you can obviously tell by the
title it's just to get ready with me
this is probably gonna be the makeup I
do for my actual birthday plans if you
don't already know what I'm doing I'm
actually like away I've taken me and my
friends to like a secret destination for
them just for the weekend so I wanted to
be a film this and get this up for you
guys so I'm not sure how active I'll be
over the weekend but it isn't gonna be a
full of glam look so disclaimer here
there's gonna be a lot of makeup
kind of like expensive ish makeup
actually but now I'm looking like there
is like a mix of stuff it's basically
just like all my favorite products and
obviously when it's your birthday you
want to feel special and we're kind of
extra glam that you might not usually
wear so get ready for glitter copper
nude full glam realness of all my
favorite products which I have listed
down below so if you like the look of
this makeup look make sure to give it a
thumbs up especially because it is my
birthday it's not subscribe button if
you haven't already but I feel like all
we can do now is get ready so obviously
wearing my favorite color because it's
mummer
low so to begin I'm gonna always tries
my skin using it via glam the ball
cosmic moisturizer I have been lip here
loving this at the moment it's like a
matte glow finish I know that sounds
really weird but it literally is it's
almost like a bomb so it feels really
matte rather than your classic super wet
feeling moisturizer but it gives such a
gorgeous glow to the skin as well and it
does actually have a priming qualities
okay and it smells amazing as well
literally smells like vanilla so gonna
be using that today and if you've never
tried like glam glow at skincare
products they're literally at some of my
face I only really knew about their
masks and they've recently introduced
moisturizers and setting sprays and all
that good stuff so I'm loving it now a
little extra step in terms of hydration
I'm gonna take my attacher luminous
Julia's skin mist god I love this stuff
you can wear this actually on top of
makeup as well moving on to primers
using one of my faves this is the
Marc Jacobs coconut primer I love this
stuff I feel like it's almost it feels
like a kind of wet a wet skin
moisturizer you guys know I just like to
buff that in with a brush over the past
week if you've been following me on my
socials I would have been in Morocco
with wild Sal obviously cuz I'm pre
filming this so I don't really know how
the trips gone or it went so far but I'm
sure it was the best thing ever just
gonna get myself all primed and ready
now that's all done I wonder if you guys
can guess or what foundation I'm gonna
wear before I show you guys my favorite
of all time
yay hands up if you guessed Giorgio
Armani luminous silk I'm gonna be mixing
the shades 6 and at 7.5 gonna be using
mostly at 6 because it's the slightly
less tan shade but it's my bath Dave I
want to be really tan I'm gonna be
really it turn so you don't need to tell
me if you think this is too done because
that's probably what I want to look like
yeah so today is Friday and today is my
actual birthday so I'll probably be at
like the location that I'm having my
birthday ah it feels so weird to like
organize your own birthday that makes
sense cuz it's like I wonder what people
are gonna do or what they're expecting
but I knew I wanted to do something
really kind of like big I did
contemplate it for ages I was thinking
like do I don't I it so I got a lot of
money but you're only 21 months I feel
like it's kind of like the last big
birthday before like that to use that
like looks kind of big back there I
might probably but yeah so I thought you
know what screw it I'm gonna do it and
that ruins I was just gonna bring it
down to your chest huh No
so it's foundations like this which
don't have like maximum maximum coverage
straightaway I do like to stipple it
onto the skin and then go in with my
Beauty Blender just to blend it all Oh
literally this month of October is gonna
be so busy already the first week of my
birthday and I'm already on holiday
then obviously away from my birthday and
then the week after that I've got like
so many people's birthdays
I feel like around this time of year so
yeah it's like so many people's
birthdays and it hasn't been ages and
I've like forgotten what you do like
presents and like pre planning and all
that stuff and like everyone's gone back
to uni like all my friends so it's a
little bit of a crazy month and with
Halloween to leave me a suggestions down
below what to do for Halloween this year
because I still have no idea
don't say that Pennywise clown because I
feel like everyone's gonna do that
unless I did like Michael and version I
was thinking I was like taking inspo
from desi Parkins melted skull that she
did by the way shape tape taking the
shade medium taking inspiration from how
like melted skull and maybe doing like a
melted clown no that makes sense
let me know if you'd be up or like a
game for seeing a tutorial on that I
have no idea how that's gonna look or
anything I just kind of feel it she just
kind of came up with it the other day
like I thought about it the other day
yeah let me know what you guys are doing
for Halloween what you're all gonna go
eyes or like what looks that you'd want
to see you garland needs and spoon I
can't wait to see everyone else's
Halloween tutorials like all the og ones
in like their studios like desi and
crispy Oh under shall do you like a
gangster clown again but maybe like the
Pennywise clown I've always fine at this
stage my eyes literally look like pins
little piggy button pins that is all
blended in oh now I'm gonna take my
Rimmel insta duo contour stick in the
shade dark and just take the contour
color just gonna use this to contour but
it's actually quite a warm color so this
will add some warmth to our skin too
I always just like to take a duo fiber
brush for this I actually really love
this it applies really dark and I
thought like when I first applied it
like oh my god too much it's gonna be
like it's gonna make me look so orange
or yeah just add too much color but a
lot of these
it's kind of like blend into nothing you
can see like the color was really dark
and this is the shade dark but I don't
know if it's just because of like my
foundation or anything but it really
blends into nothing and adds the most
like subtle contour which I have really
really like rather than it be like a
really pigmented liquid bronzer making
sure to blend down your neck okay so
that is it for creams for now I'm gonna
go ahead and set my face with powder and
do it my brows all the products I've
left it down below I don't already
include my brows in law just because the
products never really changed but like I
said I always leave them down below and
everyone does their brows differently so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then
we can move on to the eyes okay so the
eyebrows are done and I just sculpt them
out with my Anastasia Beverly Hills
concealer in the shade 1.5 so the
eyeshadow today I'm gonna take the blank
canvas cosmetics master Series pennant
and for the initial transition color I'm
gonna take the shade browsin and strut I
think you guys know by now that like my
favorite go-to kind of like a glam look
it's definitely like a half cut crease
just because I know I just think it
really suits my eye shape and like I get
like a big lid color going on I don't
like I said I don't think eyeliner
really suits me so much anymore but then
whenever I do do I don't know I kind of
like it but I do love a good a blown out
look and it's just one that I know
always it's a safe option for me then
I'm gonna take the shade comment to
deepen up that socket while I was doing
my other eye I was just watching
Kardashian's I can't remember I told you
guys or not but ever since I watched the
10th anniversary is special I thought
you know what ever since I watched the
10th anniversary special and they played
some like throwback Clips I thought you
know what I can't actually remember if I
as I really watched the Kardashians from
the beginning I've seen the odd one hair
or they're on like for music from time
to time but I haven't watched it all the
way through and I have hey you which is
a really good app to watch like American
programs on so I started watching it
from the beginning I'm on season 4 and
oh my god I can't tell you how much I
miss that old Kim car
Jensen was such a like naughty girl if
that makes sense I'm just gonna go in
with the shade Coco yeah she was just
like really misbehaved and I feel like
she has this image night I guess it's
because she's nearly 14 which can you
believe she's nearly 40 but she's
obviously a lot more mature and stuff
she was a right laughs back in the day
and the way that they all talk is so
funny and Chris Chris is hilarious oh my
god and kyliyah looks so different like
so different but I know B all we all
know that now I'm just gonna sculpt out
my lid using the same fancy that I used
to uh sculpt out my brows this one's
quite like a thick concealer so I do
make sure to kind of like wipe a lot of
it off so it doesn't lay it too like
thick and heavy on my lid so today is
actually it's Saturday for me so the
week before my birthday and me and my
mom have literally just spent the whole
day like cleaning at my flat from top to
bottom
just because I'm literally gonna be away
for so long and it's always so nice to
come back to like a clean flat you know
a like fresh sheets
everything's been away and it's tidy and
I just kind of wanted to get it done so
just kind of taking it like halfway
across and then whenever I use this
concealer I kind of just like to press
it and so there's no like there's not
like a ton of excess and for the lid I'm
gonna take the peaches makeup pigment in
the shade wow this is honestly one of my
favorite pigments I can't remember the
last time I used it and I was actually
gonna look at my last birthday makeup
video because I was thinking to myself
I'll laugh that I've literally done
exactly the same look I feel like I have
but obviously it's a new year so I'll
have used like new products but you guys
know this is really like my favorite
look and I'm not gonna do Oh something
that I don't like on my birthday cuz you
want to look and feel your best another
one of my favorite products is it
mack reflex glitter in reflex a bronze
so I'm just gonna go ahead and take a
little bit of like glitter glue and just
tap that basically where we just place
that base lid pigman and then just press
the glitter on the top yes to the reflex
glitters from Mac I love them they're so
like finely milled so they're super
comfortable to wear and like I just love
the way that they add such glam Ness to
your makeup look and I have them in like
every color
there's reflex gold and reflex pearl
which are so pretty in Mac collections
they normally like come back out with
that process so hard to get hold off I'm
just gonna wipe away the excess from
underneath my eye I'm just gonna mix the
shades Lily and got us together for my
inner wanna highlight Lily's more of a
matte shade so I'm gonna go in with that
one first and then goddess is slightly
more like an iridescent gold so I'm just
gonna kind of press that on to the top
I'm gonna go back in with that common
shade just to diffuse the lid and crease
colors together you guys know the drill
and this technique it's like one of my
faves just to make sure that everything
is kind of blended seamlessly together
and then on a smaller fluffy brush I'm
going to mix the shades Hickory and it
corruption together to finalizing
Deeping up the crease I make it super
smoky let's add some drama up in here
and then you guys know I always go back
in with previous brushes just to make
sure there's no harsh lines involved on
a pencil brush I'm going to take that
common color which was the one that we
used to diffuse the lid and crease
colors together and just run that along
my lower lash line to tie it all
together like that I always find having
a color on your bottom lash line just
makes your eyes pop and I'm just gonna
put my favorite pencil in my multi and
this is the Marc Jacobs eyeliner in
sunset you
no I like obsessed with these highliners
and this is the most gorgeous color and
then I'm just gonna take a flat brush
like this and take the color Hickory
which is the kind of more brown and dark
shade and just press that up in to my
lower lash line just to add like a bit
more drama and kind of mimic what's
going on up in the crease I'm gonna go
ahead and apply it mascara and lashes
and for lashes I'm gonna take the velar
lashes in it see through they're just so
gorgeous
wispy and winged out I love these ones
so I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
that and then I'm gonna show you finish
eyes then we can move back on to it
their face and lips so these are the
finished eyes of the C at the lash glue
is just drying you guys know this is
literally one of my favorite kind of
looks to do I'm obsessed totally switch
up the colors of your board of seeing
copper and bronze I just love this
technique and I love the reflex bronze
glitter I just love it okay so let's
move back onto the base okay so to
bronze up the skin I'm gonna take one of
my favorite bronzes this is the
Immaculate arised skin finish in dark
golden and I remember I used to work a
Mac one of the slightly fairer skin
girls introduces to me and said that
honestly because this is actually
technically like a face powder they
would just like this is one of the
nicest bronzers to use if you have like
slightly lighter skin obviously it does
show up on more tanned skin because I
would class myself or like to class
myself this stuff like wanting to be
more tanned but if you just use it
really softly it's honestly the most
subtle natural bronzer like it's not too
orange it literally is kind of like
golden so this is just like a go-to
bronzer for me that I know it's gonna
look really pretty obviously is not a
look unless I use my Mac mineralized
skinfinish in global glow I love this I
use this literally every day it's like
the most gorgeous bronze II below which
is my favorite thing ever I love putting
it literally everywhere and you've never
used it I definitely recommend it you're
in the market for like a slightly
luminous bronzer or just loved the
appearance of like more subtle glow to
this
I love that one just to give the skin a
little bit of a quant or I'm gonna take
the Mac blusher in harmony which is
actually yeah it's a blusher but it
makes for a really nice warm contour
powder okay for blusher I'm gonna take a
recent fave this is the Mac Becca what
no I've been using so much man is the
Abeka
blusher in wild honey which is like the
most gorgeous soft pink flush it's a
really subtle I think the last time I
use this I said like if you're not a
massive blush wearer that's such a nice
alternative because it's super subtle
and it just gives a gorgeous I like a
subtle flush to the cheek like nothing
to paint nothing too warm just really
pretty now unto highlighter I'm gonna
take the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
glow and peach glow just on a little
brush and use this as like aa almost
like highlighting a primer the base I'm
just applying it with a brush and kind
of buffing it in but then I'm gonna go
in with my finger to kind of do the
final blend just because I think the
warmth of your finger kind of works
better with this product and I love
applying a like cream or a liquid
highlighter before a powder I think it
just gives the most gorgeous base and
like anything that you put on top is
literally gonna really cling to it
really pop pretty stand out and you're
literally gonna be gold lorina literally
glorying so oh my god I might really
buddies might come out I wasn't even
trying to go out even though I know it's
sassy like for me here now okay let's
apply the final highlight and this is
the diamond glow powder from artis
Couture and Illuminati Illuminati where
am i from sorry yes I am I'm just going
to kind of take this lightly because
it's a loose highlighter and just kind
of dust it over the cream oh sorry I'm
just getting excited over that my name's
Marie England
and then gonna apply that to my little
Cupid's bow and stuff now to finish off
for my lips I feel like it's obviously
gonna be nude it's me it's my birthday
I'm going to be drinking lots I don't
anything that I'm gonna be like thinking
too much about so I'm gonna line my lips
with the a Mac cultured lip pencil on
top of that I'm gonna take the tart
artist lip paint and salty which is not
how I'm gonna be on your girlfriend
I love these paired together I actually
really love I really love the formula at
the Tarte lip paints I'm flying to a big
support order and I have got a couple of
tartlet paints and they're yes boy yes
boy yes boy so I know that it's kind of
really light but I'm gonna go in with
the mac lipglass in nude on top which
was one of the new ones that came out
with it Nicki Minaj's collection which
is like a gorgeous peachy color and has
a gold reflex in there I love this okay
so I'm gonna go ahead and take my glam
glow glow set a setting spray to drown
myself Jets just to set that all in
place bar this is the finished makeup
look so this is the finished makeup look
as I would have literally just said but
