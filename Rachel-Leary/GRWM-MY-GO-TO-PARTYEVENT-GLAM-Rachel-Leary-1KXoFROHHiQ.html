be doing a get ready with me because I
am literally about to head off to an
event for my go to a glamour for events
or parties or something like that so
expect a lot of makeup in this video it
is a bronzer glittery glam smoky eye
nude lip you know the drill but it's
gonna be a bunch of different products
that I may not necessarily use on camera
or actually just some of my favorite
cult products I always use that I don't
necessarily post the details on if I
post it on Instagram as like a quick pic
or something like that you're gonna see
it all in this video so if you like the
sound of that make sure to hit the
thumbs up button and hit that subscribe
button if you haven't already come and
join the family so many of you have
joined us recently so if you're new here
then welcome major the notification Bell
is on in transport a shout out in the
next video there is a notification shot
at the end of this video so stay tuned
to see if it was you but without further
ado if you want to see me going at from
0 to 100 get ready for my events with me
then just keep watching
okay so I've already gone ahead and done
my brows as per you just because I've
been like one everyone does their brows
differently and - I did a brow routine
not so long ago and it hasn't really
changed since then except for the darker
hair I'm using kind of more of a tip
brow all over rather than a pencil and
dip brow but today we are going to an
event as I see it you know so I'm
feeling like going extra as I'm
sure you would have seen at the
beginning they kind of look we're gonna
do so the main palette we're gonna be
using today is the morphe 35o - palette
and I'm just going to be taking this a
light brown shade here in my crease and
we're gonna go for a little winged today
but there's gonna be wings there's gonna
be a glitter it's gonna be an odd thing
so just buffing that back and forth I
just I woke up this morning thinking oh
my god my hair is literally black but
I'm loving it it means I can get away
with being a bit more and I think it's
going to kinda make my eyes pop out a
bit more because a lot of warmness
running through it so I'm really excited
cuz you know before my hair just kind of
had those blondish as she highlights
going through which I did really really
like now I've gone darker having that
kind of cut up running through it I
didn't think would look as like natural
and as nice so I've gone for like a warm
up chalky Brown I mean I'm sure what
I've posted a pic of this look and then
you can see my hair in yes crease come
out done and that was this one so now
we're gonna kind of just keep getting
darker and darker I'm gonna go for this
one here we are going for quite a dark
smoky eye today which I haven't done in
ages I think the darker hair is just
inspiring me you know to be a and a
dangerous then just going back in with
my original fluffy brush to diffuse it
out they just like my favorite blending
brush at the moment this is the blank
canvas cosmetics e20 I saw a lot of
comments recently saying can you tell us
what brushes you use so that was the
blank canvas
8:20 this is a matte - 1 7 now that's
all diffuse out again just going darker
and darker I'm just gonna take one of
I'm just gonna take one of these kind of
Barry Brown shades to a further deepen
up the socket and the brush I'm using is
a map two to one brush it's almost like
the two and seven but it's just more of
like a tapered edge so it's really good
at being precise with the placement and
just gets a bit more definition going no
one in the crease I always kind of like
hold my brushes in my hand and just keep
alternating between them to make sure
that I get I don't know it's just like
there's almost like a reflex to just
pick up another brush and just diffuse
the color just keep going back and forth
like so and it's okay to be messy you
guys know I love to give it a bunch of
it's a winged outlook I always clean it
up with a wipe and again just taking the
previous brush and just diffuse like so
I will go in with a couple more crease
colors by I'm gonna start with the lid
and for that I'm gonna use the Kylie
cosmetics copper cream eyeshadow and I'm
not sure if this is permanently
available and I don't always like to
recommend ordering from her website but
this is one of my favorite products of
all time it is the most gorgeous perfect
copper shade perfect for these kind of
things because it really helps to carve
out the crease if I find that a similar
more accessible product I will leave it
linked down below but I'm just taking a
synthetic brush this is a Mac 135 but if
you're wondering why I have so many Mac
brushes it is obviously because I used
to work there but I no more feet
definitely do loads of groups of Mac
brushes a really good quality and this
is just kind of like one of these
classic concealer brushes so actually
I'm sure loads of brands do it so I'm
just kind of using this to carve out a
crease but we are gonna be going in with
a glitter today you see that it's
honestly just like my perfect cream
shadow and I actually love liquid
eyeshadows and cream shadow so it makes
me so happy that so many brands are
bringing them I just like so and now I'm
just gonna quickly go back in with the
second brush that we used just to
diffuse
that cream shadow into the crease colors
so there's no harsh lines on the lid for
glitter today we're gonna take the lip
cosmetics glitter in cowgirl this is in
the size three so it's a little bit more
like a chunky glitter it looks like this
how gorgeous is that color it literally
screams me I'm just gonna be taking a
little bit of the two-faced glitter
glory on the back of my hand
and just use a brush to go over that
cream eyeshadow and then of my favorite
brush to apply glitter with is the Mac
two or four two brushes these are such
amazing brushes I love them I only used
to have loads in my kit and I know
they're lit cosmetics glitters do come
with like their own adhesive but they
make it a little bit more like a liquid
glitter and I want this to remain chunky
so just using like a regular glue just
kind of pressing that all over again
another reason to do your eyes first
this time cuz it all kind of falls down
but I thought this glitter really
matched that corporate shadow perfectly
and I just love the look of damn it
together again just gonna take some of
that glue press it on top of the cream
shadow and just pile on you know like
how gorgeous is that glitter I die okay
so once that is all plied I'm just gonna
take a wipe and just wipe up underneath
my I'm not gonna clean up the shadow
just yet because we're gonna be adding a
couple more crease colors to deepen and
a dog nap I just want to kind of clean
up so I'm not like irritated okay so I'm
gonna take a little bit more of that
kind of second or third crease color
that we use and just again go back over
the glitter to make sure the transition
isn't like blocky or stop and start like
there is a blend even though it is with
glitter and matte shadows I'm now gonna
go back in with the morphe palette and
just take this dark brown shadow here
and then I'll probably be going in with
the tiniest bit of black so I can't like
dip my brush in a little bit of both
because like I said today we're going a
little bit deeper and darker than usual
I feel inspired by my own hair again
going back in with previous brushes to
help diffuse it all and again same
just buff buff buff it out buff buff
nothing out I don't think I'm gonna dip
in to the black just yet cuz I kind of
like it how it is without the black so
I'll wait to see whether or not I
actually want to use it I'm just gonna
go ahead and clean up underneath my iron
this time create oh the wing shapes you
kind of wanna aim it towards tail of the
brow which is again another great reason
why you should do your brows first cuz
it gives you kind of somewhere to guide
yourself to now just see if they're even
which they definitely are no okay once
we've tidied them up I'm just gonna go
ahead and highlight my inner corner and
for that I'm gonna take the single
shadow from Mac called
nylon and hannah has this and whenever
I'm around her house and we're getting
ready I always ask to borrow it because
it's the most gorgeous inner corner
highlight shade ever and I can't believe
I didn't own it before like that's
someone that works there loves Mack I
just never I never picked it up I don't
know why and I always like to highlight
my inner corner before I do my eyeliner
because I feel like you take it in and
then to highlight on top you might just
get on the eyeliner okay so for Island
today I'm gonna take the NYC liquid
eyeliner and literally open my favorite
liquid eyeliners to use and I'm gonna do
this off camera because I always just
dip down at the amount of times it's
Mike I might as well have not inserted
the clip or even bothered to film it you
guys know the drill just gonna be doing
the eyeliner I do have an eyeliner
tutorial and that is always a link to
down below I'm gonna go ahead and do
that and then apply mascara and lashes
because we have a lot of a drama going
on on the lids I don't want anything too
drastic to cover up so I'm gonna be
taking my favorite everyday lashes and
these are the Lily lashes in opulence so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then
we will be back and we can start the
skin okay so these are the finished eyes
literally it's such a classic Rachel
Party glam look warm period smokey Ness
eye under don't think I'm gonna add
black because the liner went well and
adding black is sometimes a way that I
like to mask if I've done my eyeliner a
little bit shorty so I'm gonna leave the
eyes like this and now we can move on to
the skin skin is literally like my
favorite part so I'm gonna go ahead and
just moisturize my skin you
the mac prep and prime essential oils
stick they do do a liquid version of
this essential oils but this stick is so
like lightweight and feels so yeah light
on the skin it doesn't leave a really
really oily residue but I do like to
wear this if I'm gonna be wearing a lot
of matte and heavy duty foundation this
just for me helps it sit nicely on the
skin and I also love to use a fix plus
to really hydrate my skin as well
speaking of fix plus me and Amy are
going to be doing a at Facebook live on
Thursday so tomorrow basically is
showing you all the hacks you can do
with a mac fix+ why we'd love to use it
and basically our glam for a mac fix+
event that we are going to in the
evening so I'm sure I'll be posting at
more details of that tonight or tomorrow
during the day we'd love for you to join
us on that because I'm so passionate
about Matt and have some good light
inside tips and knowledge when it comes
to products like this so definitely make
sure to check out the Mac Facebook page
for that I'm sure I would have linked it
somewhere already so moving on to the
skin it's a primer I'm just gonna take
the wire selbst all ours primer just
because this is the perfect combination
for me in terms of primer as it's really
hydrating on the skin but it's not like
super wet feeling and obviously because
I've just applied that oil and stuff I
don't want anything to feel like it's
slipping and sliding around my face like
so okay so a full foundation we're gonna
be mixing it two together we're gonna be
mixing the huda beauty foe filter
foundation with the NARS all day
luminous to 20 different night textures
inconsistencies but it's the color that
I'm trying to achieve so I'm just gonna
do a couple of pumps of this and then
just one pump of hooda on either side
then just take a Beauty Blender mix them
together and devta this just gives the
most gorgeous coverage like it's so well
it looks incredible in pictures I know
it's like a little bit excessive but I
always feel like skin is just so
important especially in pictures and of
that events and stuff it's always what
you want to look your best so if I
concealer I'm gonna go in with the
makeup revolution I can
and define in the shade c5 I've been
reaching for this recently over my
heart-shaped tape obviously because it's
such 1 an incredible dupe - I don't feel
so bad for using it because it's so
easily accessible and I really love the
color as well and again just using the
tapered side to blend okay dyes will
blend it but I'm now gonna take the top
shape tape in the shade deep to throw on
the floor to cream contour with and I
feel like I want to pick up the makeup
revolution one in a few of the darker
shades to replace this cuz I love it so
much I just like to take a duo fiber
brush to do so this one is from blank
canvas cosmetics and is the f40 of five
I just loved the appearance of a cream
contour it really really helps to warm
up the skin can't forget to contour your
double chin okay now that's all the
creams kind of done for now I'm gonna go
ahead and set everything in place with a
powder laughs this is the Too Faced
sweet peach powder I just love the smell
of this and the way that it just keeps
my skin looking matte Luther to bake in
place I'm just gonna go back and finish
the eyes now and I'm gonna take this
shade here and just run it along with a
pencil brush along my lower lash line
just to kind of connect everything ah
you can see it just makes such a
difference with your eye color as well
in terms of just making it pop and stand
out which is always something that I
love to do and then I'm actually gonna
put something in my waterline today this
is the NYX glide on eye pencil in gold
and bronze one of my favorite products
to wear in my waterline as it just
literally makes my eyes pop literally I
love it and I'm just gonna apply my
favorite bottom lash mascara and then
you can talk this is the Mac extended
play so these are they finished
oh so now we can move back onto the skin
and finish up with the lips so that
bronzer I'm going to take the NYX
no filter powder in the color golden sea
one of my favorite more subtle bronzers
especially if I've already a cream
contour there's just kind of like almost
sets the cream contour in place and
doesn't apply anything to oranjee or
anything it's a really nice golden color
as the name would suggest and then of
course is not an event if I don't wear a
shimmery bronzer and I love this one
this is from a beauty a bakery is their
illuminator and this one is in the color
so I see I just like to dust it all
around it gives such a gorgeous JLo glow
I'm then gonna go ahead and apply a
blush and for blush today we are taking
the Mac extra dimension blusher in just
a pinch the most gorgeous shimmery
peachy color adds the most gorgeous
subtle flush of color to the skin the
peachy undertone I feel just like ties
in with the ILA
and it has a really gorgeous glow to it
I swear I'm using like so much Mac say
and that's just a complete coincidence
but it's just good stuff I can rely on
in terms of what I'm going to events and
stuff but now I'm just gonna take the
anastasia beverly hills liquid
illuminator in the color bronzed
normally i use the color peach fears but
today i wanted to go for something a
little bit like darker so I'm just gonna
take this color and mix it all around on
my hand so I don't want to apply it too
too heavily so it just kind of looks
like that and just take the brush I
always use which is the blank canvas
e13 buff this in to the tops of my
cheekbones we obviously going to be
using a powder highlighter you guys just
know I love to use cream illuminators
underneath I don't want this to be too
poppin if that makes sense because it is
a bronze color I just want to give a
little bit of a glow and I've been
finding recently if I use a liquid
illuminator that that almost matches the
color of the highlighter it would come
across a little bit too harsh so I
thought I'll try out using the bronze
one and just apply it a lot lighter and
then when I go in with the lighter
highlighter under on the top it will
just and now I hope it'll just look a
little bit more subtle
so speaking of highlighter I'm going to
be using at the
melina master crime highlighter this is
honestly one of my favorite highlighters
ever and just on an Anastasio Beverly
Hills highlighter brush dust that on the
top yeah I like that combo with a
slightly darker illuminator underneath
you felt like it blends a little softer
and easier but I mean advents you always
want your highlight to be perfect
because it looks better in pictures so
that's a skin done that we can move on
to lips I'm gonna be taking you two of
the bucks and Cosmetics plump lines
this one is in the color incognito and
then I'm going to go ahead and fill it
in with white russian literally love
these so much I say this all the time
they just applied literally like a
butter and blend so easily and then I go
so just filling it in with my Russian
and I love the fact that they're like
plumping pencils because they just glide
on so easily and I love making my lips
look bigger and this little brush
applicator really helps to blend them
together I'm gonna keep it matter today
so that is it I'm just gonna go ahead
and spray my skin with fix+
as always just to make sure everything
is just kind of looking fresh and it's
set in place but that is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys loved
this a makeup look and get kind of like
an insight into the full coverage of
glam that I do kind of for events and
when I want to look the best I can for
pictures and parties and all that stuff
