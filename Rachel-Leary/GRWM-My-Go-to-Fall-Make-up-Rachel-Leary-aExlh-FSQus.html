today I thought I would film I kind of
go to autumn makeup look go to to me
means something that I'm comfortable and
something that I know kind of looks good
every time I wear it so yes for me that
is something quite warm on the eyes and
a nude lip I have kind of tried to mix
up I'm using different kind of products
and some of them are brand new to me as
well but the whole kinda they're not
necessarily my go to products but the
whole kind of look is more of a go-to
scheme is a lot more natural it may not
look it but you'll see you in the
products I use Brys I'm not doing a
massive full coverage a lot yeah I
really hope you guys enjoy this look
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
do let me know what your go-to full
makeup is in the comments down below and
you want to see what - then keep
watching ok so I just filmed like a
different tutorial before this one so I
already had done my eyebrows but I
thought I would talk to you a little bit
what I've used so I used the dip brow
Anastasia Beverly Hills in medium brown
towards their like end but if you follow
me on snapchat or Twitter you would have
seen the other day I went to London to
get my brows done by the brow girl on
Instagram and she is her name's Tanya
and she is responsible for doing like
Megan Fox's Eva Mendes Julia Roberts his
eyebrows like she's a celebrity eyebrow
specialist and she has her own product
line and I used the pencil in the shade
medium brown kind of towards the front
of my eyebrow and also her and it
towards the end of my brow I'm obsessed
she was so lovely so informative and she
did if I do see myself she made my
eyebrows look incredible her products
are available in from cult beauty and I
think in some Sephora's like around the
world I'm not sure it's on the website
yeah but I know that she was talking
about launching and stuff via if you're
from the UK you can purchase her
products on occult Beauty and I
definitely recommend checking them out
so on a day-to-day basis I do like to
kind of wear like glam ish type makeup
but normally I'll just do like a rounded
eyes something really wore
one meant to complement my eye color you
guys know I'm obsessed there but I've
got loads of new products I want to try
it and I thought I would just show you
but to start with I'm just going to pry
my skin it using the Nivea post shave
balm and just press that hmm my skew I
didn't I say this every time that the
smell of this is so good smells like
that boy smell and it's really cheap too
so if you're on the hunt for a good
primer I recommend this one and I find
that it absorbs quite quickly as well so
on a day-to-day basis that's pretty
handy too so believe it or not I don't
always wear full full full coverage
every day and I've been really loving
the Naza Velvet Matte skin tint this is
in the shade
st. Moritz medium one and I'm just going
to go ahead and apply that onto my skin
I feel like this is more I think it's
thicker then a tinted moisturizer for
sure but it's not quite as thick as like
a foundation I don't know about anyone
else but sometimes when I wear like a
lot of skin makeup in the slightly
cooler weather it no like breaks down on
my skin but I just trying to gets really
like dry you know so it's just something
like this is a really nice product and
I've been really liking this brush as
well if you saw my snapchat I received
the crystal or like the flawless crystal
brusha brusha shrek from neve cosmetics
and i've been really liking this one for
that foundation i feel like this is like
even though it's quite expensive you
kind of barely need any and it goes such
a long way so I think the coverage of
this is perfect for like school and
stocks it's not too heavy but I think
it's heavy enough ticket make you kind
of feel like confident and comfortable
in your skin moving on to concealer I'm
going to take the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 20 I've been
really reaching for this and using this
a lot at the moment and loads of you
guys always asked me to use slightly
more affordable products and this is
honestly one of the best concealers ever
so much pigmentation and it
like a really good dupe for the NARS
radiant creamy concealer I always
actually prefer the consistency of this
one just because of I've tried them both
and this one just goes on so much like
easier and more comfortable the NARS
creamy one is just kind of like more
creamy but I don't necessarily like that
if that makes sense it's quite thick but
yes I'm just gonna over and I'm going to
take up unto my eye as well because I
always use concealer sometimes as my eye
primer just saves me using one extra
product and to set that in place I'm
going to take the Kat Von D shade and
light palette and just mix those two
shades together and just set underneath
my eye I literally it's been at reaching
Chris so much recently and I kind of
used to refrain from using Kat Von D in
tutorials and stuff only because I want
you guys to be able like oh my audience
to be able to access the products that I
used otherwise there's not really a huge
point just in the sense that like
abusing the stuff that you can't news
but and Kat Von D used to only be sold
on Sephora and I know everyone can kind
of order from us for Sephora that's fine
but everyone knows it when you're from
the UK shipping from Sephora is such a
ball ache but now you can go cut one D
at Debenhams so it makes a little bit
better because I know my demographic my
highest two things are America in the
u.s. so I mean like most of you could
have been able to get it but I did feel
bad using it because I'm from the UK now
oh my god so good that it's in Debenhams
but also so bad because my bank balance
is so being at me but bronzer I'm just
going to take the dark mineralized
skinfinish from Mac which looks like
this your mineralized skinfinish is from
Mac are like from my favorite bronzers
dark golden again is a really really
love lovely God it's a really nice shade
especially it's a ferrous skins but I
was with hand the other week and her
bronzer of choice was this one and I
remind me how much I miss it so we all
be using it today Oh Oh
mineralize skinfinish is just blend like
so nice onto the skin as well just
because they're actually um meant to
just be face powders so the formula of
them is meant to blend really nicely
into your face they're not designed as
bronzers but obviously using one a few
shades darker will act as a bronzer so I
loathe it I'm kind of going to do my
blusher and highlighter together which
is another thing I've been loving doing
just in when I'm like if I'm just like
in a rush maybe or just haven't got time
to reach for loads of different products
so this is the highlighter from makeup
geek in the shade daybreak so you can
see it's like a really peachy color but
because it's peachy I'm going to kind of
use it as a blush and highlight it
together but I am going to take on a
blush brush next breath this is going to
do is just give me a tiny like little
flush of pink on my cheeks but then also
a really nice highlight and that's
literally it for the skin and now we can
move on to the eyes but I'm going to go
ahead and do one eye of camera just to
her save time and then I'll be back is I
this is like my go-to eyeshadow palette
I just need to be quick it's literally
got like every color eye shadow in that
I could imagine and they're all from
Anastasia Beverly Hills for our initial
transition color you guys know I love
doing this I'm going to take the bronze
that I used on my face and just above
that into my crease I just think these
kind of bronzes they've got such a
gorgeous warm undertone to them that why
grab another product when you can just
use the one that you've already got then
I'm going in with a burnt orange from
Anastasia Beverly Hills so just slightly
a darker brown then the bronze that we
just use to further deepen up the crease
well I'm better going to use any
eyeshadows in this look but I feel like
it looks more effective just using a
smaller crease brush as well I just love
how like easy this I look is
and I feel like it makes such an impact
on my eye color using like such warm
tones and like really rounded as well I
think just makes blue eyes really pop so
if you had like green or brown eyes I
would so recommend this look but then
maybe you may use more like Mozy
burgundy kind of tones but then going
back in with the original brush and just
making sure it's all blended together
now for the lid it is actually matte but
it is a pigment and this is from neve
cosmetics and it is called it desert i
honestly like i rave about neve
cosmetics pigments they are like all of
my absolute favourite pigments of all
time are from there and i feel like
they're so underrated as a company
they're a small Italian company I think
and they produce sounds like the best
products ever and I feel like they'd fo
deserve way more recognition than they
have because I never see any kind of
like major massive bloggers or anyone
like talk about them and it makes you
really upset cuz I their pigments are
actually incredible they have so many
colors and they like they're just so
good but this one is desert and it's
literally like a matte burnt orange and
I'm obsessed then I'm going back in with
that fluffy brush and just kind of
lightly tapping and going back into the
crease just to make sure it's all
blended together then I'm going to dip a
slightly smaller crease brush into these
two colors here it is called fudge and
blazing it's really bad at the moment
guys open like obsessively watching
Desperate Housewives like from the
beginning I used to watch it when I was
on TV and like efore all the time but I
got back into it and now I just can't
stop I'm on the season six
I think there's eight l'heure nope not
eight left there's only eight so you
know and it's like I started it I don't
even think I started that long ago but
somehow I'm like near the end already
and I'm getting really upset I'm trying
to think of what I'm going to be
watching next I've got to the bit where
like Rene's in it and pull yarn is back
I won't like give anything away in case
you've not watched and you want to watch
it try deaf or recommend that you should
but right now I'm just going back in
without pigment because I feel like I
lost some of it on when I blending that
dog color in but I'm only concentrating
that dark color on the outer portion
like that that's literally all I'm doing
on the top of my eye I am now going to
go in with a little pencil brush and it
take that blazing shade so this lightly
read more red one up the two I just used
and just run that along my lower lash
line to tie everything together I always
love really orangie warm tones on my
lower lash lines because when it
connects up I think it just kind of
pulls everything together and also it
just really it makes your eye color pop
and I'm all about enhancing like your
favorite features and for me on my face
my eyes are my favorite so I want to do
everything I can to make them look like
as good as they can then I'm taking this
color here is called lace and I'm gonna
use that as an inner corner and brow
bone a highlighter you guys know I used
to live in Australia so if ever you hear
me like just suddenly dip into an
Australian accent it's because I used to
have one and but I do like put it on it
just makes I don't know if you guys knew
that used to live there for four years
when I was like one close about four or
five and I missed the accent so much I
actually love doing accents
I always crack them out and I actually
quite good at them as well like I can
still recite my French oral exam from
school I don't know why I got I don't
know if it's like a memory thing but um
like the tune of it it makes me that's
how I kind of learnt my exams I would
put things in like a tune and stuff and
for one of our French exams you have to
speak a whole conversation and French
and I can still remember the first
paragraph of mine but I'm just gonna go
ahead and pry it mascara but I and I got
full marks on it because my accents
really good over like notes you gonna do
it I'm gonna want to hear it wait on it
after I've applied mascara I will do it
right actually I you know me I always
have to wear lashes with us only because
you look really close you can you see my
lashes are kind of like and for me
that's just I don't I need more even
more lash in my life I wish I was had
natural for once but for lashes today
I'm going to take these ones from
Eschete oh they are in the style black
magic now oh my god to the fallout
buckle it's on my jumper you can see
they're just kind of wispy and they are
kind of more on the natural side and I
ever sort of like what but they are
actually more on the natural side but
I'm going to apply glue to that now I've
I've had a goo I will speak French to
you so if anyone is French
I'll give ten points if you can
translate it and if I get it wrong then
I apologize because it was a long time
ago but but actually x launched in cafes
with criminals and ballet addicted
clearance bicycle in the air cleaner
wait ass I'm going to run actually x
grant in cafes to Clemens origin body
AdvoCare cleon's Baskin Liang dim it oh
my god I call him ok maybe I can't
remember as much they thought do you
that I don't think about it it just
comes out but I just really thought
about it then and then I forgot yeah you
can see like when I'm drunk on a night
out more is that I could speak thank
Jeff on something really and then I just
say that and they're like wow but really
I'm saying I used to work in a cafe and
it was fun or some like irrelevant
bullcrap
but I'm just gonna wait for my lashes to
dry and while I do that I thought I may
as well apply my lips on today today I
do obviously just like a good nude and
I'm just not going to line my lips today
I'm just going to take miss lipstick
from Mac and apply that all over and I'm
going to kind of
press into my lips as well and then I'm
going to go in with the lore'l disco
ball a dazzle glass just so it's not so
nude and it kind of brings a bit more a
life back to good lord life back to my
lips
these L'Oreal lip glosses smell really
good too then I'm actually just going to
dip my finger back into that highlighter
color we were using or not in a corner
and just use that to highlight my
Cupid's bow okay now to just quickly pop
the lashes one oh god I always get
confused with like rounded lashes like
what sides want do you see what I mean
just to me I think it just looks looks
better with a lash and there we have it
so this is my finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it used a
few new different products and I just
love that it's just kind of like fresh I
think it kind of looks quite put
together but really I didn't use a lot
of products or there's not really a huge
amount of product in my face
I know it's warm looking a nude lip and
you'll all be like wow but the next look
I use this like a cool tone darker lip
and I am trying to mix up obviously like
this is like what my everyday kind of
autumn makeup would consist of and I
know a lot of you guys want to see it
and it might be appropriate for those of
you that maybe want to wear more makeup
for school you want to like put together
and not be wearing too much because I
feel like like I said there wasn't too
much makeup involved in this I don't
know if I can just rambling I know I
don't need to justify myself I know
people will say something yeah I really
hope you guys liked this makeup look
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
did and subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in next one ye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
