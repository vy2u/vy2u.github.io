Allura see hey guys welcome back to my
channel thousand first thank you guys so
much for half a million subscribers I
can't even explain how overwhelmed with
like support and love I felt over the
past couple of days it means so much to
me that so many of you like interested
in what I'm doing it just inspires me
and makes me want to work harder for you
guys so I'm not going to drive on too
much because I feel like everyone does
that but honestly it's thank you thank
you thank you but on into today's video
today I created this kind of simple
summer makeup look and it's a get ready
with me so you can just hear me chat
about while I'm getting ready and
creating this weave I'm interested in
more products I use I've listed them all
at down below so if you like the look of
this makeup lip and definitely make sure
to give it a thumbs up and it subscribe
if you haven't already and let's just go
ahead and get started surely hmm hello
hello we're ready to begin I've already
done my eyebrows because they take a
long time but obviously I'll tell you
are useful inaudible to prep my eyes too
because my eyebrows at the moment I've
been using it via benefit precise brow
pencil in the shade 3 through the front
and then via Maybelline micro brow
pencil in a soft brown towards the end
and then decide it will in case I use be
a makeup forever brow gel in the shade
25 and that basically just lightens up
from the hairs because I use kind of a
darker pencil and that way I'm kind of
getting a mix of all the torian's that
are going on and listen we are going to
do the eyes first but I am just going to
apply my skincare bat-cycle at a time
set in I'm going to use the L'Oreal
hydrogenous what is this it's like
they're intense hydrating cream serum
I'm just in love with this at the moment
I think my skin's looking quite good at
the moment of reducing for myself and
I've been using that new L'Oreal kind of
skin care as I showed you and like like
Instagram stories on most snapchat the
other day so if you haven't already depo
check out I'm loving it at the moment so
I'm just going to let that kind of sink
into my skin to begin I am going to use
this customer buxom eyeshadow palette
you can buy the six in so there might be
an even smaller one as well
and you can kind of custom pick the
colors that you put in but VIN out right
there where you want to do something
quite minimal matte and quite basic
because I want to do a bright lip and I
did want to do like a winged lip just
because like I haven't done one in ages
and I want to mix up the summer looks
I'm doing and it's so easy for me to
just do like a really bronzed rounded
eye in the nude slip or like glossy
colorful lips so I am trying to mix it
up but don't worry those two tourism
probably still come I'm just trying to
mix it up so I'm going to stop with this
shade here I can't remember off the top
of my head but I've definitely listed it
down below because I did some research
afterwards who I am going to the
research off with to find out the actual
shade so it's just a good nice soft warm
up Brown we're just going to buff that
into the cream okay so recently just
going to zoom you in a bit so you can
see what I'm doing but I've been loving
I've always say this I think I found the
reason why but loving Michael Finch and
Sean grim and on there like drugs at the
moment and their snapchat and I was
watching their barley blocks earlier and
you know I keep saying I keep saying
thinking or like thank you because of
them now he's now Michael saying what
does he say he says not a problem and
all the days I can't stop saying it to
myself like I am a bit it's just funny
and Joe I think is one I used to live in
Australia so I think I go kind of
connect on that level is that make sense
but I feel like it's I can get away with
saying it because I did used to have an
Australian accent all the time I talk
like this all the time when I was from
the age of one to four yeah I lived in
Australia so I feel like the way that
they say things that I like I thought I
wish that was still the way that I spoke
so I always catch on to what they're
saying really quickly but it also just
made me think about the weird that
me and my friends say like if I really
think about it and we get told it a lot
by like other groups of people that the
stuff that we talk about is like no one
understand and we forget that no one
understands it and I was trying to think
of like the phrases that me and my
friends say like wheels we instead of
you know it's always
or something like that so let me know in
the comments down below if there's any
weird that you and your friends say
together that like only you and your
friends get and that you don't even know
why the you said but you just do
I've got my friends saying thank you
with a Q and they don't even know who
they are it's just so catchy and it
makes so much sense as literally thank Q
ye so we just started with that one
transition color I'm going to take this
gorgeous and fun orange color here and
your tree of cephalus color especially
underneath the eyes which obviously what
I will do next I'm just going to place
that and drag it kind of further across
the lid as well yeah I kind of want to
give something simple pimple but still
kind of like easy to do the summer and
not feel like you're wearing loads on
your fade rating so it's not going to
feel very heavy I definitely want the
skin to be bronzy I always want bronzy
skin in summer embrace that dude oh my
god
thank you guys so so much of how many I
didn't address this is the first being
in the video I probably will in the
intro but this is now just talking about
it thank you so much for 500,000
subscribers and going out to dinner
tonight with my mom and my dad to
celebrate a little and I have a few of
my friends over last night just to
celebrate as well I'm honestly just in
all that's half a million of you that
have clicked that subscribe button and
it's just so bizarre like that's a lot
of people watching me chat and
blend eyeshadow and I don't know just
like you guys confided me a lot like
with that my Q&amp;amp;A that I just did and
loads of you really love that and I'm so
pleased with the response I got from
that because I don't like to come across
like I thought I knew best like I'm
getting legal advice and my advice is
the only advice I just thought it was
like quite a cute idea in terms of just
being able to connect with you guys on a
more personal level so thank you guys so
much for the love to support just
everything over the past couple of days
just the whole time I've been here like
what was that but yeah thank you guys
okay next I'm gonna take my concealer
and kind of create a bullet carve out
the crease just because the color we're
going to put on top is like a matte
cream color I really want to show
up and just look as they want it to I
think I find just making sure we've got
a really clear base to do so is the bet
so I'm not like going drastic with this
it's not a good super cut crease look I
never do my videos like this in the
sense I'm doing it both or at the same
time I'm literally just winging what I'm
doing because I haven't practice but I
think it's because it's such a simple
look I'm not too worried I didn't feel
like I've got to practice yeah okay so
to set that all in place I'm going to
take this matte cream I show again I
will leave the link down below but it's
from buxom and just press that on the
top is pretty much the same color as the
concealer which is great which is going
to make sure that it's all set in please
like that I would say yay like I'm so
pleased myself it actually were I'm
going to get back in with that gorgeous
Sparkie and orange color and just kind
of emphasize the transitions I do that
by just kind of going like in circular
motion just over that line like so I'm
getting a bit sick of the weather at the
moment don't know about anyone else but
where I live one day it's absolutely
pissing it down and then next it's
boiling hot I don't know how to dress do
I need a jacket because one is literally
changing out of nowhere so I don't
really know what to do and my baby is in
the moment also astronomically out of
control and if anyone I've got like some
good products to keep them down but like
I kind of just wanted to go but I know
they're like broken bits of hair hope
you only cure is to grow your hair so
maybe I have to turn it brown anyways
I'm going to take a white because the
next shadow game you just love a black
underneath that after I do eyeliner on
and then I do a wings and it looks I'm
just gonna I'm just gonna just go across
I'm aiming towards the tail of the brow
as I use
okay okay and before I do the winged
eyeliner I'm going to just highlight my
inner corner and this is a carbon-rich
look my favorite type inner corner
highlight to do so is this icy white
shimmery shadow here again I will listed
it down below so definitely make sure to
check out there because the continent
the names of my head but it's part then
as you're going to find out in my inner
corner my inner corner is the one place
I just I could never I never liked it I
feel like I can never hire at my inner
corner as better as somebody else can
but whenever I'll get my makeup done
they can always do it really nicely and
I just can't I don't know what it is it
literally is so poppin and bright I'm
impressed
yes now I'm going to go ahead and do my
winged line answer that I'm going to use
the NYX epic ink eyeliner and I'll be
back because I actually kind of talk
when I'm take my iron concentrating so I
I'm going to keep it quite small I say
that now I'm going to try and keep it
quite small and then I'll be back okay
because I really do winged eyeliner
anymore I'm always so quick I'm always
quite quick with my makeup and I love
around an eye that I forgot how good
that epic in High Line is I tested this
out when we went to the family to the
next back at the beginning of the year
and I feel like if anybody just come out
if I'm wrong please correct me but I
said it for ages they said like I
couldn't use it because I hadn't come
out that makes doing winged eyeliner so
easy I'm obsessed it by completely matte
black super black really precise nib
love it doesn't mascara I'm going to
take the little Big Shot mascara I've
been loving this at the moment that you
guys know I will be applying false
eyelashes but this mascara is so good
I've honestly been loving it at the
moment and it's an lashes I've been at
loving these at the moment as well these
are from that Lilly ghalichi in the
style
opulence if you've been wanting to try
in lashes i know they are like a little
bit expensive for a lash but they
honestly last so long and they do some
really really gorgeous like natural
styles as well as eye Tori I'm just
picking up the video don't mind me as
well as like their dramatic lash they
have some really gorgeous ones that
literally look like lash extensions
almost I've worn these before and
someone asked me where I got my lash
done could I'd stop see set them down
quite well but because they just lips a
Natura so I really have been loving
these and these on forget again to start
opulence I've been loving the lush ones
as well
I'm just going to apply a little bit of
glue that's another thing anything that
ends in ye up again like Glee pinky how
he nice to be as such a big thing in my
friend said it was always Haru
Howie only God everyone must have
Santa's so five million while the lashes
are drying I'm just gonna I'm just going
to apply my primer and I crammed it in
an old say it's be a toothpaste kind of
X so that should give that a coupler
governor poops I am going to be applying
a liquid illuminator to my skin as well
to add a bit of color so let's just let
that sink in and pop the lashes I think
obviously the beauty is drying but I
just think they look so pretty and
natural for like every day but yes as I
said San Fran liquid illuminates and
we're going to use the NYX want to blow
it liquid illuminator in pure gold and
just stripe that on our face really I'm
just applied a corner I'm going to use
the same brush as a pile of clothes
why not Han whoo look at that blew up
right so full foundation today I've been
having as you guys when teasing me
follow me on my social probably more
like my snapchat or Twitter anything but
having a massive makeup clearer and
literally decluttered so much tougher
I'm almost refined in old favorite so
I'm going to use the natasha de Nonna
face glow foundation in the shade of 42
and just a couple of pumps onto the skin
and apply it with a damp sponge it is
lightweight and dewy but it almost like
apply quite sick witches annoying but I
find the finish isn't super full so I
always like to use a sponge oh my god
lunch I'm going oh and always comes just
as I've got like events instead of
coming up on exciting weekend this
weekend so tomorrow we
there is a big Knicks party and we're
celebrating the launch of new some new
products coming out and all that good
dance and then on a Saturday I've got a
big kind of day with benefit so I did it
before would benefit just like a
bottomless Ranchi just hanging out
chilling out with them all and you know
should be fun I love those kind of
things and seeing everyone doing if you
can see that but it's super lightweight
on the skin even though their projects
decadent and white does that anyway so
can see you know I'm getting the same
one I used to apply my eyes with which
actually I think I said is the NARS
canal now radiant creamy concealer and
it's going to apply that underneath my
arm you're just going to add a bit of
coverage and help brighten let's get
dabbing alright so before we go ahead
and set that all in place with powder I
don't know this is less link to this
down below I think I don't know if it's
aimed I like in all places yet but this
is the new hula quickie quintal stick so
from benefit they've come up with a
cream contour stick pop de una and I'm
so excited
I got I use this the other day and it's
so creamy and so easy to blend it gives
such a nice natural color as well so
let's go ahead and blend all and add
some warmth and dimension give such a
pretty like glow to the skin I love
cream products in the skin yay I mean
now I'm going to set everything I'm just
is how do I don't want to be too too
heavy with it just because food like I
said I've been with a summer look I do
like the appearance of Julia's skin but
as I just underneath the eyes it is
really important that and to me
especially like above my top lip as well
they're just the places that I find I
get really hot and that my makeup comes
off the quickest and all and I've set my
nose as well so once that
all sufficiently set I'm going to go
back in with the eyes oh my god I think
I always read about this one
be it sunset Highliner from mark Beauty
oh my god my absolute favorite in the
bull sign at the moment I just think hot
I can talk and we're back I just think
are someone that perky just like really
dark colors in the water it's such a
gorgeous substitute because I do like
the appearance is something in my water
and I think it gives a lot more like a
seductive look that that one is just so
complimentary on me personally with
green eyes as rising will it actually
scientific any icon I think that's such
a stunning alternative like a dark brown
it is called sunset so definitely check
it out but as I say I'm going to go back
in with a big fluffy brush and again
that really deep war deep one room like
burnt orange color and like buff out my
own eyes I kind of want it to be quite
smokes out and smarty so if you didn't
get that I want it to look smoky just
pass that along the lower lash line like
so and then apply bottom at lash mascara
same one again and we can continue on
with the face so these are the eyes done
sue Parton and all that young a few
shades on the lid and yeah me so quite a
bit quick easy I look to do but and lips
we put together I would say okay so to
finish off the face on the network
likely Oberon bit with the Enix and Noah
filter powder in the shade golden these
are literally like affordable tubes of
the mineralized skinfinish from Mac and
I actually prefer there were much more
extensive color range in there and
Philip more like quality and warm which
over II appreciate these are actually
just meant to be a face palette but I
love to use dark ones as bronzers bit
more when affordable alternative then
like I said going to my makeup powder I
found this old gem this is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in topaz and I
sorry I'm just into the brushed I would
use that I used to be obsessed with this
it gives such a gorgeous golden glow to
the skin I always go in with a shimmery
bronzer
days normally it's Mac Global glow but I
just wanted to mix it up and use this
because there's a lot more of golden
color and I love it
and another better product is I thought
it really tied in with the colors of the
eyeshadow this is via blusher in Tiger
Lily is there a luminous blush I put
totally appropriate for the neck and
with God skin is looking so pretty and
to finish up and get a highlight my skin
with the fleet Cleopatra's kiss
highlighting palette and taking a
missionary that's slightly a bronzer
shade but then to make it pop a little
bit extra on the same brush taking the
lighter shade and then spraying on my
brush with the cover effects
illuminating settings which I really use
on my face but just because it's such a
light mist it's not like a like here's
my six clubs like that such a how many I
wasted a comeback like that was such
like
whereas this budget so it just dampens
it slightly blends like a dream yeah so
that is the skin done and now I'm just
going to take the NYX suede matte lip
liner and spoiled again which is like a
coral color because we are going to go
in with like a coral here I don't want
to go like too bright orange or too
bright pink I do like I do that a lot so
I go in the middle and I thought this
goes with the iPhone as well and then
for the lip I'm I'm going to go in with
the colour-pop ultra satin lip in a
jacquard I think this is mm-hmm
and then I'm just going to go back in
and highlight my keep it slow and then
use the cover a check-cashing spray to
so it won't take this actually has gold
particles in it by the way
I don't know they like advertised that
but I got told that it does from the
people that represent them so you
actually are going to be illuminated yes
completely cat is off now but that is
the finished look so obviously as you
guys thought this is the end result and
the unfinished makeup looks I really
hope you guys enjoyed it this video and
