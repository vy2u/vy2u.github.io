 it's New Years Eve I am so
excited for the new year I can't tell
you I'm so excited for New Year's Eve
because it is just an excuse to wear a
 ton of makeup and it's gonna be
okay it's like I said this is gonna be a
lot of makeup in this tutorial we have
done a silver sparkly full coverage glam
look which I hope you guys appreciate
and love if you do make sure to hit that
thumbs up button and also hit that
subscribe button and the notification
bar while you're there to make sure you
never miss another video in the new year
like I said this is a full-coverage glam
look I've listed all the products down
below but if you want to see how I got
this look then just keep on watching
right we're gonna start the um we're
gonna start doing our bass first because
I'm never gonna be using glitter and
stuff but because of the way I'm gonna
do my face I'm gonna find it quite easy
to wipe away any fallout anything like
that but if you're not confident in
doing that but I would go ahead and skip
to like the eye part and then maybe come
back it'd be prefer to your eyes first
but a few a questions recently if asking
me what face makeup I've been wearing oh
my god I've literally found the most
full coverage long wearing for me past
need combination of products which I've
been at love love loving obviously we're
gonna be piling on the makeup stay
because it's New Year's Eve or all extra
spot care and if you don't like a lot of
makeup you're on the wrong video
so I'm just gonna start by hydrating my
face and I'm just gonna use a little bit
of a mac fix+ to do so that one was the
lavender infused one and I'm literally
obsessed with it it really really
hydrates and like wakes you up it's such
a refreshing scent because we're gonna
be wearing quite a lot of skin makeup I
want to make sure my skin feels a super
hydrate and moisturize underneath so we
are gonna be using the for Sally a
unicorn essence kind of serum this works
really well under makeup
everybody smooth it smells amazing and
just gives us such a gorgeous glow
underneath the skin that was also in my
favorite products of the year campaign
video that I did with hand so if you
haven't seen al inside like a little
card here honestly it smells
sorry good next up for primer
we're going to be using the huda beauty
of complexion perfection at primer this
is really good as well because it's
moisturizing but these are really good
tax in the skin that's how you know that
you've got a good primer that serum also
has a little bit of attack again that's
how you know it's gonna work really well
under makeup like I said this is a
really moisturizing yet tacky finish so
your makeup is literally gonna cling to
this and it's not gonna move over using
my Real Techniques multitask face brush
to buff that in but I do think they sell
this individually anymore today if they
do can someone line link it's me down
below I went to the shop the other day
to try and buy this and I know that they
used to only do it in a set I said I
just I can't find it anywhere
and I really need a new one otherwise
okay I'm moving on to foundation and
this is why I feel like people might be
like what but
how you know it's gonna be a long
wearing and it's such an oldie but
goodie and such a trustworthy foundation
this isn't the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation in the color 3w to cash in I
recently got this kind of report back
into my life they kindly sent it to me
honestly it is full coverage like it's
no joke but honestly doesn't move I
swear I I couldn't be bothered to take
my makeup off before having a shower
because I was so tired I think I was
actually little bit drunk at the time I
just needed to kind of wake myself up a
bit so you know on I always sometimes
just go in the shower wash and stuff and
then come out and then kind of like
douse myself an oil and take my makeup
off and I know that doesn't really make
sense that sometimes you just have to do
these things and I swear I came out the
shower after wearing this it was still
on my face like looking perfect and
that's how I knew this is gonna
literally last you through everything
but like I said it is full coverage so
I'm gonna be like blending it out with a
Beauty Blender but kind of just
stippling it onto my skin first so I'm
just gonna be taking the Real Techniques
sister blush brush I'm just kind of
stippling the foundation over my skin so
this is gonna look and feel pretty heavy
like I'm just kind of using this brush
to this place all over my skin I can't
forget your ends and then once it you
look like a completely washed out alien
you're just gonna go ahead and take your
down eg bender and then work it into
your skin this is just gonna really
press it into your skin absorb any of
the excess but still give you like the
best coverage just gonna make it feel a
lot more comfortable on the skin all
reet I feel sufficiently blended so now
we're gonna be blowing your Montana
products so we're gonna be taking out
heart shape type in the shade medium
this is one of what a full concealers
we're gonna be in what the hell what a
fall can see this we're gonna be
applying so just gonna go ahead and
apply this underneath my eyes if you
still haven't tried tar shaped a 20
teen hasta baby that you do I must say
this every time I use it if your fault
coverage lover like many changes your
life so I'm just gonna use the same
beauty blender and that in and this ones
are any like a little bit lighter than
my natural skin tone this is the shade
medium babe this is a bright enough for
you then you don't need to do the next
step that I'll be doing well actually
everyone's plans for New Year's because
I'm thinking having that kind of I'm
gonna say this now I'm having a fairly
quiet one but I feel like it's me and it
probably won't and no way but I don't
want to go into the New Year really al
and you can hear it in my voice now I'm
just gonna take a little bit of the
tartrate tape in the shade light medium
and I'm just gonna put that just only a
couple of dots and I'm actually just
gonna buff it out with brush and really
kind of focus it on where my under eye
bag mark lines ah there's that make
sense and that's gonna really help to
cover them up and give you a super
airbrushed finish also just thought I'd
mention another foundation that I have
been loving is that one from the
collection you know they have the
collection lasting perfection concealer
and then I put on my snapchat or the
longer that they'd come out with the
foundation so good ab really full
coverage
long lasting drugstore foundation is
finally coming to us
besides the although like Maybelline
ones but you know what I mean another
one to add to the collection yes okay so
now we're gonna cream a contour and
speaking of the lasting perfection
complexion products I'm gonna be taking
the shade deep from tar again and also
the nude shade from the collection
lasting perfection concealer range and
this one is in the shade v medium deep
this is such a gorgeous all of you
colored concealer so I use this to kind
of place in at the main kind of contours
of my face
so just kind of couple dots on my
forehead on my cheeks I am gonna take
the Amalfi m3a brush which is part of
the nose contour kit that they came out
with and just and then with that
collection of concealer I'm just going
to use that to almost connect up and
just kind of apply in the gaps if that
makes sense so just kind of give an
overall bronze look and help kind of
blend out the columns
I know this looks like a lot of makeup
but realistically it isn't I
 love it but now we're just gonna
blend out and I'm just gonna use a duo
fiber brush to do so so as you can see
they're like the darker shape tape kind
of acts more like that contouring color
and that medium deep collection colleges
adds a little bit of warmth and bronze
eNOS
love it just keep on the lending
sometimes when I'm blending I'll just
spray a bit more fixed glass just kind
of helps helps blend everything and make
it a bit more easier to learn and then
to blend out my nose contour I'm gonna
be taking this little brush from iconic
London and just rubbing and blending
down the concealer on - it's like the
perfect size little rounded brush then
you can use your beauty blender just to
make sure there's no harsh lines we are
looking that's not okay I'm now gonna go
ahead and do my brows and then set my
face with powder for that I've been
using the Mac Patrick star powder oh my
god this is honestly a game-changing
it's the nice one the nicest powders
that I've used as a slight pink
undertone to it so it really helps to
brighten any areas that you want to
brighten and honestly it sets your whole
face for the whole day so I'm just gonna
go ahead and do brows do this and then
we'll be back to finish the skin brows
and face our shuttle my brows and face
are set and done you know how I do it my
brows I literally just didn't update
brow routine probably a different
technique than you've ever tried so in
sight like a card here you can go and
check that out if you are interested to
see the way that I do Brielle's so let's
continue with the face so I'm gonna go
ahead um get a brush i'm just gonna
enhance the contour slightly just taking
the NYX probe powder contour
highlighting kit and just taking the
shade hair just basically setting a
price then I'm just gonna lightly warm
up the skin at taking it the Too Faced
natural sunny Sun bunny bronzer this is
just gonna warm up the skin add a little
bit of glory the nori
basically just pack it on kids now for
blusher
I'm just gonna take this gorgeous brush
it's from Milani and it is called a
berry amore
as you can see it's like a gorgeous
pinky Goldy bronzy color new this is soy
trio
now to make your highlight like B pop in
and last all night you guys know I love
to use a cream highlight first so I'm
gonna take the Maybelline master
stripping liquid and just kind of apply
that as a base for my highlight then I
just like to apply it with the brush and
just blend it up and into my skin now
don't be alarmed but we are gonna be
wearing like hmm including this three
highlighters one powder no one cream one
pressed powder and one because it's New
Years Eve and if you can't wear three
highlighters one can you chunks every
day you can duh okay so the first
highlighter we're going to be wearing is
from the Kylie wet set which I finally
got my hands on because it finally
arrived after finally waiting a whole
month and then paying their two pounds
to use it but I'm just going to be
taking the shade sweet dream and I find
these applied best when you use your
finger so I'm just gonna take a bit on
my finger and then press it on the top
oh now even though I had to wait a long
time that glow kind of makes it worth it
then yes and then finally just as almost
like a highlighter topper I'm gonna be
taking the artist Couture diamond powder
in gold digger which is like an
iridescent white gold shade I'm also
gonna be using this as my inner corner
highlight which I've been doing a lot
recently which a lot of you have been
asking about cuz it shows up so well in
pictures so this is what I've been using
and I think if it's not yet it is coming
to PG Bay in the UK so we're all gonna
be able to glow to our hearts content
I'm literally just taking the tiniest
amounts I don't wanna overdo it
very very similar to the Kiley wet set
shade but this one's just a little bit
more yes obsessed with this skin okay
I'm gonna go ahead and spray again with
fix+ I'm now gonna go ahead and do one
eye and then I'll be back to do the
Olive occurs I've got no idea what I'm
doing and yeah I need to think not gonna
lie I'm actually obsessed okay I don't
make sure I did so we're gonna take the
Too Faced
Just Peachy matte palette honestly this
is the best crease color palette ever
they're literally all matte shades I'm
just gonna take these two and mix them
together as our initial transition color
honestly like I knew the kind of look
that I wanted to do but this just turned
out way better than I thought
like I'm not normally a massive fan of
silver I thought you know it's New Years
so I'll do it and I'm just it's so
perfect you know it's like the perfect
little wing this is honestly like the
best I've ever done anything I think I
really love my eyebrows for one this
skin is the most like gooey glowy
full-coverage pop in skin I think I've
ever done
and this eyes just so damn yeah I'm now
gonna take these two shades and blend
them together you guys know I've always
just like to go back in with the shade
that I've used before and then move on
to like the next one that makes sense I
just feel like it makes the blend a lot
smoother and easier I'm now gonna mix
these two shades together
also guys my brush is getting smaller
and smaller they're all like fluffy
crease pressures but just getting more
and more precise there's still like
little fluffy brushes so this is kind of
like a blown owl but I'm not going to
too far because like I said this is like
a winged look so just kind of like a
rough ish winged look always go back in
with the fluffy brush this brush
is honestly amazing is the e20 from a
blank
this cosmetics it's so firm and honestly
just lends out anything and everything
I'm now just gonna take the shade peach
top which was a warm dark brown color
and this is think it's gonna be the
final color that we'll use we are gonna
cut up the crease a little bit which is
why I'm taking every color from inner
corner to outer corner because we want
them to show up so it doesn't matter so
much time getting it like on my lip
there or anything because we're gonna be
cleaning it up and kind of the more that
is there the better I'll show up so
that's the final crease look to cut up
the crease I'm gonna be taking the
estilo Magnificent metals liquid
eyeshadow in the shade I'm and dust you
could leave it as this I do go on with
another glitter but oh my god
let me show you like this is the most
gorgeous silver glittery product like
ever
I love these stealer magnificent meadow
shadows there honestly I'm so kind of
like foolproof like I'm obsessed and you
know what I did actually apply another
glitter on this side but I think it
looks a lot better without it so I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna apply it on the
other eye I know that probably looks or
sounds would be weird in the sense of
they might look uneven but they actually
look fairly similar but this the texture
of this one just for me looks better I
might actually even just go over this
you know and then just going back in
with those like medium crease colors
that we used in the crease just kind of
going back and forth
I'm just diffusing the glitter into the
crease colors okay I'm now gonna hand it
my inner corner using the same
iridescent Lee white gold Hadji that we
used on our face my brush was wet before
I applied that
I just sprayed it with a bit of fix+ and
I'm just gonna quickly finish up
underneath the eye going in again with
that medium crease color it was called
peach cobbler and just running that
underly right on and then I'm taking
that peach tart color which was the dark
brown color just on a small flat top
brush like this pressing that in to my
lower lashline and then buff that out
with the pencil so that's what it looks
like kind of as like a rounded I by I'm
gonna go ahead and do a winged eyeliner
and this is the NYC and liquid eyeliner
which is like one of my favorite black
eyeliners ever just kind of doing small
brush strokes blown across like that I
kind of want like a medium thickness and
then take your time here folks I'm gonna
flatten the brush slightly
like so I think this look is like so
cute I'm now gonna go ahead and apply
custom riche I pencil from Mac in my
waterline it's like a really gorgeous
warm dark brown I'm just gonna go ahead
and apply it mascara and then for lashes
I'm gonna be taking the morphia premium
lashes in seductress and I'm so excited
to wear these look they're so like full
big and dramatic palak paneer so I can't
wait to show you their finished oh my
god
so these are the finished eyes I
literally love them they're so New
Year's Eve I can't stop staring at my
eyes okay now it's time for the lips so
I think it's obviously it gonna have to
be a new but it's gonna be a part
bin nude so we're gonna go ahead and use
Mac world lip pencil to outline our lips
honestly one of my favorite nude lip
pencils to use ever it goes it like
everything then for lips I'm gonna take
the morphe liquid lipstick in virgin I
love the formula of these they are so
creamy they lost wages and they
literally blend like a dream yes nude
okay and you could just leave it matte
if you are more of the map gal but I am
NOT I love a gloss and we're gonna be
wearing two well one study PA a lip top
of I'm gonna take the Too Faced lip
injection in milkshake and just put that
on on Lilith
yeah so the glossy lip and then it just
to finish it off I'm gonna take the I
thought this was skinny dip but it's the
San Tropez lip top up from as you a just
make them look even fluffier and to kind
of guide the eyes yes to the say oh and
finally to finish off I'm just gonna
spray again with fix+ this isn't
necessarily a a setting spray it's
actually just kind of gonna make
everything look a little less like it is
like just get rid of any powdered effect
and just make it all look better but
that is the finished look so that was
the finished makeup look I really hope
