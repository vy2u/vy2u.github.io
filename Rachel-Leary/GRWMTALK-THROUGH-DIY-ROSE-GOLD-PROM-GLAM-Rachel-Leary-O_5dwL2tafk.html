channel or if you are new to my channel
then welcome to my channel today's look
is the first kind of prom makeup
installment I went for a rose gold
winged look super highlighted skin kind
of more of a blush focus than a bronze
focus but it's still all very bronzy and
glowy and just like a look that I love
totally I've explained it and I've kind
of done it in a step-by-step so if
you're doing it yourself hope you find
this video helpful
definitely tag me to recreate this look
and obviously I'm not doing like a full
outfit get rid of me tonight you're
going to prom but I put some lette super
blingy hoops in as you've seen in the
intro so I left a link to them down
below I am obsessed with these yes if
you like the look of this makeup look
then it definitely makes sure to give it
a thumbs up and please keep watching
all right everyone so I did one eye
because I was trying to save time and as
you know I want to do as you want it to
be exactly the same as my wedding get
ready with me and if you haven't seen
that thank you so much for all the love
on that and I'll probably have like a
link to somewhere but I'm going to go
ahead and prime it I believe you're
doing your makeup for yourself for prom
you definitely want to get an eye primer
it makes you I makeup lasts so much
longer and apply so much better and this
one my favorite ones this is the
Maybelline Color tattoo in creme de nuit
it's literally just a pale yellow shade
which I find if you've got a fairer skin
is a really nice face for your eyeshadow
because it just looks out any color it's
super full coverage they do want in a
creme de rose as well which i think and
is perfectly looks like more turne skin
I need you some others that Mac also do
some good ones cotton level is cooled
now taking me back to my master days
like groundwork or something happen if
they do a lot more light and colors if
you have slightly darker skin if you
just want like a matte eyeshadow base
like this like that and then I'm going
to go ahead and set that with powder and
I'm just going to use the powder and
Panji in my face which surprisingly
isn't Laura Mercier today it is the
benefit Porefessional mattifying primer
amy raised about this and I was gifted
it as told as it like just as good as
the more
once I'm going to try out today and so
far in terms of setting my eyeshadow
it's working quite well what a view
oh great for the eye today I'm going to
take the Amalfi a bronze smoker
eyeshadow palette pretty sure this is
been out of stock or it was supposed to
be limited edition but it's actually
coming back in stock today like I didn't
even realize I knew I wanted to use it
and then I saw on their Instagram it was
back in still say so I think I actually
all in mind directly from the website
and I can't remember there being
problems with shipping so there so it
checked that out you like kind of
slightly pinkier Browns and all that
kind of stuff oh and I don't know if I
said but the color I use is this one
it's going to bug that into the crease
using my tutu for I freaking love this
brush it's what such like firm bristles
myself explains everything I have like
so many of these and I use most
different things like really good for
highlighting as well you should serve
the napkin okay so the next kind of take
is this one here and just use that to
further deepen the crease I don't want
this lip to end up being too dark City
like it you can get quite carried away
and you don't look like you've been
punched in the eye or prone there's
going to use circular motions of this em
okay so many of you keep saying that I
look like Hannah from 13 reasons why I
showed my hands and they all were like
you know but so many we keep singing I
posted on Twitter and like everyone on
Twitter was like no I don't see either
so maybe it's just in videos or
something but she does have brown hair
so maybe if I have brown hair I don't
personally see it either but just going
to buff that in it's it's nice and soft
now we're going to move on it to the lid
color and I'm feeling very Mac today I
don't know why when it comes to DIY prom
makeup i always think because i'm gonna
have it for used to work at mac everyone
just always wants to get their makeup
done at mac for prom and it always gets
so kind of like booked out pretty
quickly and I'm going I used to work
that we get prom bookings in like
January and wanting to reserve and get
their makeup done so
why not use if you like Mac products is
that still like the case then you can
just go in and buy it yourself so I'm
going to be taking you via NICs mixing
medium and then just going place on the
back on my hand and then place that on
it to my eyelid just so the pigments
have something to stick to and they come
out a lot more kind of pigmented and
they don't transfer or fall down or
anything like that so first I'm going to
be taking is the color naked I freaking
love that this pigment is absolutely
stunning is I feel like it looks
absolutely gorgeous on events like this
and like for brides especially it's not
enough that it's just like satin it's
not super super sparkly but it does have
a little bit of sparkle to it but it's
not like a sparkly some of the other
ones it's so pretty and I'm just going
to concentrate that on like in the most
part and take it kind of like a third of
the way across like so and then the
second pigment I'm going to take is tan
and I used to recommend this pigment
test
anyone with like green or brown eyes I
think it's stunning it's like a rose
gold II movie I don't know what kind of
color but it works so well with these
cruise colors and I'm using that it's
almost like a shimmery transition from
the naked pigment into the crease colors
just a little bit of extra sparkle on
the lid you can have this all over your
lid if you wanted something slightly
darker I think it looks so pretty to set
in the middle Perl
yes and then finally I'm just going to
take this pinky dark brown to kind of
tie everything together and just give
the outer corner like a bit of depth
just kind of buff that in on like
literally that Altemus part in like
inward motions slightly up into the
crease you guys know I just like to go
back in with my previous brushes make
sure everything is blended together yes
one more Mac pigment we're going to take
and that is banana pigment from that and
that is because it is one of the most
good in a corner highlight ever it
really pops really opens up
your eye it's very like golden white
which I really really like who's going
to take for that mixing medium in my
inner corner and then this teeny teeny
pencil brush from zoeva literally
perfect for inner corners and just place
that on top like so it doesn't matter if
you get fallout underneath that's a good
day about doing your eyes first because
then you can just wipe it away as you
guys know I love to do which is what I'm
gonna do now I'm just going to wipe away
because I don't want to add any more
crease colors anything if you want it to
be even darker go ahead if you want to
be more dramatic go ahead I'm kind of
what I'm just throwing brushes anywhere
right now so I'm just going to walk it
away and I wanted to be winged out so I
kind of work towards I also like the end
of my brows going to be because not
there right now these leave a message I
was going to add gears from the top but
then I thought that's quite some if the
look that I did previously but don't
feel limited add as much glitter as you
want now I'm going to go ahead and do a
winged eyeliner and for that I'm going
to use the retro black fluid line pen
from Matt now I really like this for
events because it's based off they're
like fluid line which is traffic
entities like that gel liner pot but
it's like a liquid liner pen to the
formula of it lasts just like a gel but
it's in a really long defined pen so I
really like this so I'm just going to go
ahead and you can see I've kept it
really thin I really kind of just wanted
to stand in a line instead you know what
it works so i normally just get I want
to do thin and also got really like the
fluffy wispy lashes and really want them
to like show so I don't want any like
stick eyeliner to take away from that
and to install me in a corner and the
tip of this makes it super easy to get a
defined line I always like to use at the
sides of these pens I feel like it's how
you get the most pigmentation and
normally I would say get thicker as you
go like Albert
today because they want it to be really
thin I'm kind of keeping it the same all
the way across like that and then you
can use the base of the eye the base of
the eyeshadow helps you to then do your
eyeliner I can never get the words right
on how to describe that but it gives you
a really good basis what I'm trying to
say and the good thing about doing your
eyes first as well it means that you
kind of make the base of the eyeliner
really messy because then you can just
use your weapon needs to make it super
super sharp which is what I always like
to do I've seen another Stern line of
guys I'd quite like it quite like it now
I'm going to go ahead and apply it
mascara and I'm going to use my
Maybelline the falsies angel pressure
mascara this is like my fave ever so for
plan on scar and now I'm going to apply
it my lashes and these are the peaches
makeup mash in the style 18 look at them
guys this so wispy and full and just ahh
I love them so these the eyes before and
I'm now just going to go ahead and apply
them and I'll be back so these are the
eyes with the lashes I derive the easier
to put on the lash band is so thin so if
you're looking to get lashes for prom
and you're not 100 cent confident
definitely get one of the super super
thin lash band even that actually clear
so they're going to look super natural I
still like the Kardashian with these
lashes this big love it so now I'm going
to move on to the skin so to begin I'm
going to moisturize easing it the new
Urban Decay hot springs moisturizer
loads as you asked me how this is or to
kind of try out like though I would try
out a video I've used it underneath my
makeup a few times recently and it's
literally you know I read about that
bliss moisturizer it feels slightly
thicker but now but I get the same sort
of results and says it's super wet to
skin and how gorgeous Lauren Elizabeth
Beauty it's an OPI gel called like home
REE Winkle or something I love this
color anyway on black conferred wish
riser as it leaves my skin feeling like
a baby's buttocks it's so soft super
intense moisture so I've been loving it
so far and I've also been wearing the
lip balm that came with it as well which
is really good it's like coconut oil
infused and anything with coconut oil
infused means it's going to be super
good for your skin speaking of which
moving on it's a primer I'm going to
take you be a month
Jakob's coconut primer it's going to
have actually it uses in a tutorial I
know this
hi around the Marc Jacobs coconut-lime I
think Hannah I then Hannah Renee we
don't know her I'm sure you did she
actually hasn't reviewed them so head
over to her channel to check out the
review on this but I am just going to
apply this up the one thing I noticed I
just kind of went the first time I used
it and it looks you went like everywhere
so close keep it close to your skin and
it comes out quite quickly very careful
but just a few drops of there without it
looking concerning I'm just going to
buff that into the skin it smells so
good really good
and I found the evening these two
moments really a nice combination on my
skin everything feels very soft very
hydrated and then like my foundation
itself just goes on really effortlessly
on the top and also I did before I even
want to use the primer I wanted to use
the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
and they're like using a primer and a
foundation from the same brand normally
are designed to go together and work
well together so I'd test them out for
you maybe notice I have tried to mix up
with the product from the center on the
eyes everything is quite affordable so
that you can do and a really amazing eye
look without having to spend a lot of
money on that but with skin and if you
want it to last a long time that's where
I would invest most of my money in my
skincare and like the face products I'm
using but there are some and drugstore
products here as well on the skin
because I mean they do still do good
ones some of my favorite products are
from the drugstore but if you're
suddenly thinking it's about Turner
splurge and stuff don't worry I'm going
to mix anyway like I said I'm going to
use be a Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation in the shade golden beige I
did have a different one of this I love
this foundation is very very full okay
like the first eye Samish first coverage
foundation I've ever used it looks like
this it comes in a little dropper thing
so I literally just do like nuts or you
need and I am gonna use a damp Beauty
Blender to apply this on the top just
going to get a little bit on the
forehead pinky again just using my
sponge to blend this is going to make
sure you get your is
foundation I could just sit here and dab
all day okay so like I said let's go
concealer I'm going to be using two the
first one I'm going to be using is from
a beauty pie it is their super luminous
concealer and it's got a really nice
little sponge applicator at the top and
listen in the shade light I think and
I'm kind of using this as like the base
concealer but it's quite close to my
natural skin color and it has a slightly
peachy undertone amazing at cancelling
out dark under eye circles anything
that's a slightly pinky a base so this
is kind of going to be doing my
concealing for me like this is why I'm
using this concealer this is what I'm
going to be using for the coverage to
get rid of any dark under-eye circles or
anything like that and then just using
the other end of my Beauty Blender just
to press another lend but I really love
the finish up there it's not on that
finish it says super luminous I wouldn't
say it's super luminous but I definitely
feel like it's not going to crease or
Paik which I mean I feel like that means
it's quite hydrating underneath your
eyes it's not very drying at all which
is exactly what you'll be looking for
doing your own prom makeup you don't
want creased under eyes so as you can
see that kind of concealed any darkness
time I've had but now I'm going to take
the amazing brightening a creamy
concealer pencil thing I'm just going to
use this in a few stripes to write
underneath my eye and my chin now my
nose any or you because me my friends
always like nori nori I'm just going to
use the sponge again - mmhmm yeah okay
and now that's are the cream works that
you plan to use if you have for your
skin and stuff then go ahead and set it
with powder now but I am going to use a
cream bronzer and this is the l'oreal
glam bronzer cushion at dis funny
because I wanted like bronzed
luminous e-type skin with this look and
I didn't want to be using powders and
stuff to achieve them so I'm just going
to take a joy fiber brush and kind of
like dab it onto the cushion and just
apply that really cheap suit of clothes
I won didn't want it to be too
and three I kind of actually wanted to
focus more on blush today if you want me
to do a super bronze strong lip and let
me know I do plan to do a cool tone look
my honey is wearing black or silver but
I just wanted like a soft bronze or
slightly bronze look so I want to do
that with creams and this bronzer is
really pretty and it's from Lorien like
four and final creamer Brooks I'm just
going to use if I'm at the 'mark
Jacobson dewdrops oh Lord I mean 90
loads of companies do it ones like this
so gentle I just get Marc Jacobs
everything that I just have wanted to
try these for ages I've got them
recently and I haven't had a chance to
wear out so I just wanted to include it
in a dewy skin prom look obviously so
just going to apply this to the tops of
my cheekbones I am going to put a power
to highlight on the top so there's gonna
be super intensive thing but yeah I'm
just going to pile it to the tops of my
cheekbones above my brow bone between my
brows because my friend amber told me
it's actually really pretty in picture
you've got quite a highlighted like
scent of the face going on
so then IQ is low and then down the
bridge of my nose
it smells phenomenal in the minimal I'm
now just going to take my finger and Pat
that in working with the fingers so
pretty yeah okay now I'm going to take
the Porefessional
shine bashing Pro power from benefit I'm
just gonna lightly dusted on the areas
that I don't want to be super like that
I know my makeup doesn't last as long
with them so around my nose and stuff up
cuz I don't want to like mattifying or
like I don't want a drastically big this
motion and lightly dust and like yeah a
rolling nose and a chin area I don't
know what to do next let's go back to
our eyes and finish off my eyes and let
my brows and simple oily skin I think
I'm going to go back and finish off the
eyes well okay so I'm just inside
sitting in my brow and I hadn't even
pressed record
thanks for gay time you
the NYX micro brow pencil in the shade -
Brown and I was saying how I like to
trace the bottom of my brow and then the
top top and then kind of connect it all
and fill it in and now I've just been
really having brow pencil in I think
that's super easy equipped to use and
then when I get to the fun I just like
to draw a little bit of a and then from
the base rather like so now do the eyes
I didn't want to do anything to a dark
underneath and I but I'm gonna
personally in my waterline and this is
like my new favorite eyeliner from Marc
Jacobs like ever I know this feels very
much Jakob see in front of you these are
actually only 20 pounds of skincare yeah
a little bit expensive that these oh my
god they do it so many amazing colors
this is my color sunset literally I love
this
I'm gonna wear like every day it's just
like the perfect golden color in my
waterline they're just going to warm up
the lip kind of slightly and like a
subtle way yesterday with me after I
apply and stuff in my water and my eyes
just going to show a bloodshot then just
kinda like been that and I'm going to
take the initial crease color that we
use which is gonna schlep abbreviate
soft warm brown and just runner
underneath and then we just can apply it
some mascara this one is particularly
good on the bottom lashes I feel just go
with the brush so I feel like these are
the finished movie back onto the skin
I'm not going to use like a bronzer
bronzer guy I'm going to take Mac Global
global global eyes skin finish I feel
like I can't complete any like a Ven
dewy skin fresh skin makeup look without
this I wear this I think pretty much
every day I think I could just adds the
most gorgeous glow to your skin if you
have a slightly more fairer to medium
skin tone and it's just like such a soft
golden bronze yeah like I said that's
all I'm going to do for bronzer blush
yeah I'm going to take laura geller
tropical hues which looks like this it
kind of having a ray of colors running
through it and it's a very like rose
gold rush' you can concentrate
up on the Apeldoorn chicas like with
prom you want to look useful and pretty
and a really nice kind of like warm
toned Russia I feel is like perfect to
that now on highlighter I'm going to use
the jersey star and money mu a grab in
Eclipse
yes honey because I call me likes
watching and playing around with this on
my snapchat or Instagram story yesterday
you'll see this is who's me
dude and I come from a brush there's
like I said I like to use a Mac two to
four and I'm just going to place this
basically on top of where we pasted that
coconut dewdrops higher to earlier
uh-huh so I could take it up a bit and
then I always like to press it back and
the skin when I light up there oh my god
so pretty and this brush works really
well with it because if you bought a
Jeffrey start condition here quite like
a creamy formula and it almost seems to
be like pressed and blended into the
skin and I find it in activity for does
that really well so maybe if you have
issues with them in the past and you're
skeptical about buying another one try
with this brush it works really well but
I'm just going to place it down the $39
oh oh
obsessed so the lips I wanted to do
something slightly rosier Golia and
think your own PG so I'm going to use
the racy reveal and matte lipstick from
a buxom really a gorgeous soft pink the
formula of these is so like creamy and
they smell so good all bug free lip
product smell really young so you could
just leave it there but this gloss is
actually it's screaming at my name it is
the buxom up full on the lip polish in
the color Katy literally look at it it's
the most gorgeous pearly peachy pinky
shade I am so excited to put
so pretty oh my god and last but not
least we're going to set everything in
place and I'm going to use the cover
effects eliminating setting spray and
you want a hundred percent make sure you
shake this before you use it otherwise
you're going to get speckles on your
face and that's because this actually
contains like golden champagne particles
it's like the what only one of its kind
I had a meeting with the PR people that
represent cover effect and they were
telling me that it literally illuminates
your skin like it's actually standing
and also sets it all in place give it a
shake it and then give a spritz so this
is the finished look i we have you guys
enjoyed it obviously I'm not going to
prom so I thought I'll put some blingy
hoop earrings and just to kind of
complement the look and you tie my hair
back let me know in the comments down
below and you'd like to see a prom hair
tutorial like three kind of easy DIY
project rolls I would love to do that
for you
obviously I plan to do a lot more prom
looks in the future so stay tuned for
those yeah I literally love this book I
think it's stunning it's just a really
gorgeous rose gold igloo II looks so
perfect for anything so I really guys
