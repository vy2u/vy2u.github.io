today is a slightly different video
instead of watching me go from no makeup
to makeup I thought I would show you
what I do to kind of go from makeup to
no makeup so basically it getting ready
with me Louis if you recently actually
been asking for an updated skincare
routine so I feel like this is kind of
included within there because I'm
virtually showing you how I take my
makeup off most nights I mean is an
extensive skincare routine but just
cries the one that I go to all the time
and what I found kind of work really
well with my skin so I feel like if you
want to see me go from a hundred to
slightly less glam and if you're
interested in just kind of seeing what
skin care perhaps I'm using there's a
few at new releases in here as well I've
been trying testing and loving recently
so yes without further ado I thought
thought what better time at to film this
video where I've got a full face of
makeup on I already posted the makeup
details of this look on my Instagram
because my friend drafted it for me so
if you haven't seen that post I will
leave it down below you won't know
what's in my face but yes without
further ado let's get started
so the first thing I'll obviously do is
take off my eyelashes they feel like
that's inevitable then once I've done
that I want to go in with makeup wipes
now usually I absolutely love the
Neutrogena makeup wipes I currently
don't have any I need to do a little
store order on Amazon so rigidly I've
just been using it these are simple what
kind of skin my seller wipes they're
really hydrating and it says to remove
makeup an MC hydrate but recently
especially on days other modes and loads
of makeup what I like to do is use the
Urban Decay a makeup room they put the
meltdown makeup remover spray this is
really oily and oil is great at
dissolving literally anything so what I
like to do is this is actually spray a
wipe with it also then spray my face a
bit and then just go home and take it
all off I feel like it's a really good
starting point I'm just kind of getting
rid of all the obvious makeup on your
face it's not necessarily a deep team
but the oil does really help to break
everything down also to me I always said
if I like to think they've got quite dry
skin and I love to make it feel hydrate
and I love to feel like oily and like
really like wet drenched skin so this is
really great for that okay so next what
I like to do is kind of I always find
the scar for me it's quite like a hard
thing to get off I always can never get
it otherwise this last year just
something on my eyes so recently what
I've been loving is the ablated and lash
wash makeup remover which basically
quickly dissolves makeup calming called
gel formula oil free and it
non-irritating
this is just base click I'm really cool
like liquidy gel I use this is cotton
pad just to go over my eyes and make
sure I've got everything off I do
sometimes just wipe it all over my face
real quick just to make sure I've got
any of the dirt off well because it is
basically just like cleansing your eyes
I thought this is pretty great at just
dissolving anything that's left on my
eyes I really like it gets all on the
scar especially like on my lower lash
line someone's always find that there's
been something there still and also in
my eyebrows I use a lot of waterproof
eyebrow products or like I'll set them
with something and sometimes they don't
always come out so I always make sure to
go over my eyebrows and everything with
them especially on days like today where
I've got like I thought a lot of makeup
on I really want to do like a deep kind
of exfoliating turn and a point that I
really like and I feel like you guys
would like as well and you haven't tried
already I definitely recommend buying it
or like reading about it or trying it
and see if you think it'd be great for
you but it's the top friction step so
basically it's almost like a charcoal
scrub but in a stick form
you just twist up and just rub it all
over your face I feel like it really
exfoliate your skin really gets in your
pores
another thing I like to use in my vanity
talent skin testing as well if I want
like a really deep cleanse but recently
I've just been grabbing at this because
it's easy just to go all over your face
and I feel like this is a bit more far
in the sack I can refill it like I
breathe in my skin it sounds really
gross but I really want oh you want to
get like the dead skin cells off and all
of that so I feel like this is really
great for that and they do do a mini
travel sized version so maybe if you
don't want to rush out and try the big
version get the mini version it's
honestly it's so fun it's not a very fun
part the skincare routine because I this
black abraded like seeing it almost it's
like a mask if you follow Tarte on
snapchat they use this all the time when
they're getting unready as well I feel I
below two people love this so yeah I
mean like this one I feel like after I
use that product or any sort of times
and my skin can feel quite dry and it's
been really not like taking a beating
but it had a really deep cleanse and
then what I love to do is moisturize
honestly your moisturizing is like my
favorite thing ever and to that I've
been absolutely loving at the moment you
guys know the Bliss fabulous drenching
crunch moisturizer and also recently at
the Urban Decay hotspring hydrating gel
both of these for Greece and listening I
feel like I always use this one more at
night because this one is I feel a lot
more wet whereas this one I kind of keep
on my desk and I use in the morning
sometimes but I do like to switch up
they both do the same thing
they literally both really just feel my
skin with moisture and it feels so so
soft doctors I can't even explain
literally like a baby but smooth like I
said this was definitely more like a gel
and this was more of your traffic
liquidy moisturizer but both I feel are
amazing if you've got choice given
definitely recommend trying either of
these as a new moisturizer for like your
day or night time I don't they fit
really nicely under makeup as well so as
a perk as well but yet only God being
prioritize is literally my fave obsessed
obsessed at first definitely it tried
I've been loving the Bliss
skincare of the fabulous range and also
some of the new Urban Decay skincare and
there's quite a few products I mix and
match between them yes nothing needs and
this one is definitely a kind of new
favorite and it weighs being pub
everyone's routine but I do like to have
a talent face because I do say can my
body and having a completely natural
colored face to me as in literature to
look like when I'm taking off my makeup
or anything and so what I've been really
loving is the L'Oreal overnight elixir
self tanning gel a what I call it a gel
is almost like a liquid but it feels
really hydrating and it does say that it
says overnight hydration faster version
what fast absorption anti streets and a
to your face and body for a natural
looking tan and I love to apply it with
am more feet g36 brush if you want to
see my skin completely clean and
moisturize I just go in with this and
kind of buffer all over my skin leaves
you is such a gorgeous tan in the
morning also been loving this after I've
used fake tan like I generally mousse
and then I wash off the mousse and I
want to reapply or just kind of maintain
it without then applying like again a
really dark tan
this one's really great this one it's
super moisturizing so that's really
great to help maintain your tan it
doesn't like come to any dry patches and
it's just a really nice like golden
color so yeah I basically just do a few
pumps this onto my face or the brush and
just buff it in and it gives me such a
gorgeous and I don't do these every
night I thought I would include some of
my favorite marks one of them I don't
actually have on me I need to go out and
buy another one and it's a sheet mask
and it is the Gagne Hydra bomb sheet
mask I'll insert a picture window click
there if you go into a local drugstores
in drug boots whatever and you want to
find it that whole hydraboost range is
like again a dream it everything is so
hydrating just so nice on your skin if
you have dry skin I am really really
recommend trying those sheet mom she
lost a great I think there's such an
awesome like skin care product and
there's such a like pampering it feels
so great to senior so far after the
shower
completely clean in your dressing gown
company sheet mask like a hair like out
the way whatever literally one of my
favorite things to do and like one my
favorite ways to unwind all I just
asked in the bath or something and these
ones feel just so cooling and wet only
got a hundred percent put in the fridge
like an hour before you use it and then
put on I bet you that feels amazing so
you do not want any sheet masks that the
hydrating ones will have all that extra
liquid in which will be like a reason
for it to be cool so I love that also if
you like those ones that kind of peel
off this ones are really nice one is be
a glam glow gravity mud firming
treatment it's the one that you've
probably seen on loads of people
snapchat makes you it look like silver
and metallic and it does come with a
little brush to apply with you don't get
it all over your fingers but I love this
one it literally it leaves my skin
feeling really kind of like spongy and
like fun but spongy does that make sense
like it doesn't feel tight but it just
feels like plump that's the way I'm
thinking of lumpy I don't do this every
night because it's expensive and all new
rollin but yes I love this one it is not
trying to ground a mask
I feel like this works for most skin
types because it's just firming it's not
like it's giving you any extra hydration
or like because I must control anything
like that so you put all your skin or
dry skin I really feel like you could
use this and yes
I like to look like a 10-man too and
finally I find like overnight I sleep
with a fan on most of the time which can
be quite like drying to your skin but
one I can't sleep in dead silence
there's something about it just can't do
it so I kind of like the noise of the
fan and - I just I'd rather be too cold
and too hot and I have quite a few
pillows on my bed and do this I'm always
getting really warm so I basically have
my fan on all year round anyway like I
said it can be quite drying so I always
like to apply lip balm before I go to
bed and also in the morning too and what
I've been really lonely at the moment is
the Milani it keep it smooth luxe lip
treatment this one's in the shade or
some 0/3 sugar smooth it's like a baby
pink it'll be of any of a tent or
anything it just really really annoys
drivers my lips look she makes them feel
so so soft and yeah I feel like it
absorbs overnight as well which is great
yeah I also like to use the new Urban
Decay coconut oil lip balm and also the
Palmer's lip balm I really like them for
on the go yes I've been loving it this
one at the moment and it smells amazing
as well I want to say it tastes good too
but I know you definitely should be
eating your lip balm so a day over the
steps that I take to a get rid of all
this makeup and how I maintain my skin
to keep it relatively clear obviously
everyone that skin types will ferry so
these products may not or may not work
for you if you feel like you're not kind
of dry normal to dehydrated skin I feel
like loads of these products work for
that also is one of those of other skin
types it's basically if you like the
look of a the products I've mentioned
definitely let me know if your try them
out and you end up loving them just like
me but I really hope you guys kind of
