clean face I'm gonna go ahead and do my
brows as I always do first
then on to skin I'm using this first
base primer spray and then just kind of
buffing any excess into the skin with
the Real Techniques brush just because
sometimes I feel like it leaves a little
bit of a residue then for that inner
kind of festival glow I'm gonna be using
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
liquid in opal and just using that same
brush I'm just buffing that into the
skin I love this underneath foundation I
think it gives such a gorgeous glow from
within especially for like festival
inspired makeup I feel like this is a
must-have
then for foundation I recently got this
today on my snapchat you saw I did a
little unboxing of a few products that I
got this is the cover FX oil-free
foundation which is amazing it's got
such a good coverage I did have to match
the color of my neck because I am a bit
more time than I usually would and my
face was looking a really pale so I'm
just trying to color much here but I'm
just pressing that and buffing that into
the skin to get maximum coverage and
make sure it lasts the longest for
concealer i'm taking this nyx HD
concealer now on the bottom of mine it
says the shade 3 but I was looking for
it online and I feel like it might be
advertised as something else I'm not
sure why it might be tan I'm not sure
but yeah and then I'm just buffing that
into it my skin with this damp Beauty
Blender just to make sure there's no
excess product and everything is kind of
as thin as it possibly can be on the
skin so you don't it just cake up for
anything for a cream a contour I am
taking the Bobbi Brown foundation stick
in the shade warm almond and just
applying that to all the place that I
want to contour my cheeks my chin and
jawline and the tops of my forehead and
then just taking a duo fiber brush to
just kind of buff that in in like an
upwards motion because you don't want to
drag it down because that's when your
face can appear a bit sunken so you want
to keep it lifted and I love a cream
kind of bronzing products especially in
the summertime I feel like they look the
most natural and it gives you kind of
more of a glow than a powder so I'm just
buffing that all into my skin yeah
then I'm gonna be a baking using the
laura mercier translucent powder as
always the reason why baking is because
I'm gonna go ahead and do the eye makeup
after this and there was a lot of
fallout so thank me later for baking
because we're gonna be using glitter and
stuff so this just enables me to kind of
wipe away that excess fallout at the end
and I did just go ahead and set my eyes
there as well taking this away the cocoa
blend palette and this light warm brown
shade I'm taking my Sigma e-40 brush and
just buffing that back and forth into
the crease in like windscreen wiper
motions you guys know the drill as
always until you're happy with the kind
of intensity that you've built up and
it's all really softly blended then it
taking this eye shadow from a sigma in
the color Kat is super warm and super
Orange I'm taking that on a smaller
fluffier brush just slightly deeper into
the crease and slightly lower down to
create that gradient effect I'm giving
it really warm cuz I wanted to do a
really bright lip too so I wanted to
kind of tie it all in together and Plus
warm tones that just remind me of summer
and that kind of festival vibe then
taking that kind of darker brown color
from the same it's a way the palette on
a slightly more precise crease brush
again just taking that into the crease
to give it a bit more definition
for the lid I wanted to keep it quite
simple so I'm just having this as my
face kind of color it is just a simple
map cream shadow from the same soever
palette and I'm just patting that on to
kind of the empty lid space but we
haven't put any shadows and kind of
taking it 3/4 of the way over and then
going back in with one of the fluffier
crease brushes that we use with no
excess product and just kind of going
back and forth between the two lines to
create a diffused blended look then
taking the litter kind of the litter the
lit glitter glue and a little brush that
comes with I'm just dabbing that on top
of basically where we just put that
cream shadow and essentially just where
you want the glitter and the glitter I'm
using is the color champagne wishes I'm
in love with it it's almost like clear
gold but it has like holographic reflex
to it so I thought it was super cool for
like a festival inspired look and when
it came in the post I was like yes
that's why I want to use then I'm taking
my favorite defined crease brush which
is the Sigma F at 36 and the same dark
brown at palette from Oh No
the same palette and taking the dark
brown at color and just buffing that
into the crease and then I'm taking a
Mac vanilla pigment to really intensely
highlight my brow bone and my inner
corner because I kind of wanted a bit of
shimmer then I'm taking a big fluffy
brush and brushing away any of the
excess ha ha and taking now the balance
pencil from Sigma which is a really nice
warm up Brown and it made my eyes go so
red I don't know why it's tough stuff in
my waterline it just makes my eyes go
really red I promise you I'm not pi or
anything like that and I'm taking it
slightly lower I did kind of want a kind
of edgy smudged out look so I'm just
taking that along my lower lashes as
well and also tight lining I think this
is what made my eyes it's super red
because from now on they look so red and
I am apologizing now then I took two of
the crease colors that we used and just
run that on my lower lash line from
mascara I'm taking Mac in extreme
dimension it's like my favorite mascara
for kind of a messy can't be first of
all lash look but I am applying lashes
and these are the velar lashes and the
style sphere they are my favorite
rounded lashes because they're super
voluminous
then it wouldn't be a festival look and
you didn't kind of paint something onto
your skin so I kind of wanted to keep it
still glam so I kept it quite subtle and
took this white gel liner from Oprah and
white rabbit and did four dots
underneath my brow to kind of go with
the first
of all tribal feel that I was trying to
achieve back onto skin I'm taking this
mineralized skinfinish from Mac in
medium tan and just essentially using
that to set everywhere we put the cream
contour earlier and just warm up my
complexion like I've been in the
Coachella Desert Sun then for blusher I
am taking this one from sleek in rose
gold I wanted something still along the
warm tone at Cora Levi's because I plan
to do a bright coral lip so this one
seemed perfect and the gold reflex arts
stunning as a little bit of a subtle
highlight then taking the Anastasia glow
kick in that glow and just going ham and
putting this everywhere I want the
festival do highlight glow you can see
me from the other side of the desert
highlight so I'm just taking that
literally everywhere all over my face
now onto the lip I'm at taking at
something really bright this is electric
coral from Anastasia Beverly Hills you
can do whatever you want you can do a
bright pink a bright orange a bright red
or you could just go nude and yeah just
do whatever you want but that is the
finished look I really hope you guys

video will probably be another prom lick

time I will see you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
