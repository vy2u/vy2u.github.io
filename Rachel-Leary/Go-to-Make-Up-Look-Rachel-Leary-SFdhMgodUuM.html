makeup look which was actually requested
and so I'm just gonna start off by using
my naxi glow foundation and just to do
my brows using my anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow in taupe next on a
day-to-day basis i don't always have
time to sculpt out my brows and on my
lid so I'm just using the lighter shade
from the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit just add some kind of base so that
eyeshadows go on a lot smoother and now
I'm taking creme Brule from makeup geek
and applying it into the greater the
Sigma e-40 just as our initial
transition color
taking lattes and makeup geek in the
zoeva blending brush I'm just applying
that further into the crease just to
give it a bit more depth here I'm just
going back in with my Sigma e-40 just to
buff out now take any matte white
eyeshadow and just apply that all over
the lid with a flat brush
guys a dark brown this is maca from
makeup geek in just a fluffy pencil
brush I'm just the primes really
carefully into the crease and then
buffing that out with them back to 1/7
this just gives the crease a bit more
depth and definition
next time move on to the face and she's
my collection mm concealer I think this
is in the shade Sara I'm pretty sure
it's there like to shade just cuz I
really like to highlight under my eyes
and all over my face and I'm just
buffing that in or blending light with a
damp Real Techniques sponge as you can
see I really like to take my time with
this just because it's quite a pale
concealer I really want to like buff it
into the skin or blend it into the skin
just so I can get it but not to look so
scary
now just take my Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit and a banana shade and just
setting the concealer with the Real
Techniques setting brush now I'm moving
on to contour and bronze in I'm using
the choo-choo face the Too Faced
chocolate bronzer and this is just the
contour brush from blank canvas
cosmetics which is so good I'm going to
link them down below so I've got a few
brushes from them and they're amazing so
yeah just bronzing my cheek and my boy
you
now on to blush this is warm soul from
Mac and just using a zoeva I'm going to
go ahead and say blush brush whatever
sitting it's different name but yet
she's applying that to my cheeks and a
bit on my forehead now on to highlight
I'm just using the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in moonstone as always
now going back in the democracy makeup
you can just taking a pencil brush just
lightly defining my lower lash line I
really like to do this I'm I like to
take it quite low sometimes on a
day-to-day basis like this one I just
like to take a dark shadow like that and
then buff it out I'm just using I think
this is creme brulee from makeup geek
just to smoke it out a tiny bit now
taking a light shimmery color I think
this is blush from the tamanna' palette
just taking a pencil brush and just
brightening up my inner corner
taking shimma shimma from makeup geek
I'm just highlighting my brow bone and
then it looks here like I've gone with a
bit of heavy hand with it so I did go
back in with my Sigma e-40 brush and
just to blend it with the UM the crease
colors down below
now from Ascari he's any was going what
I'm just using the river lash
accelerator in flat try that to my top
and bottom lashes and obviously you can
see I'm not wearing any eyeliner so
because of that I went ahead as you'll
see to apply lashes palsy you could just
wear the scar to look like this but I
went in with lashes either some cat eye
once from the Katy Perry aisle early
range range I think and just applied
them with tweezers now for the lips um I
just wanted something really simple so I
went in with my I'm gonna go ahead and
say Mac moisture rich lipstick and
permanent power but that could be so
wrong but I'll link it down below and
then just apply some really pale lip
gloss over the top and that was it I
also then went in with the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter highlight in
my Cupid's bow and under center of my
lips
I then just start like curling my hair
and I just threw on this jumper like all
the other day I was in fear mode of it
yeah how's it so I hope you enjoyed it
guys and I'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
