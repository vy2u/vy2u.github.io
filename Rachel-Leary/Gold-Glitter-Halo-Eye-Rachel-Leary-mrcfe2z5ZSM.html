I'm starting off with my eyebrows using
my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow definer
and blonde and dip brow in medium brown
then with my skin I'm using the benefit
Porefessional primer and my Mac Pro
Longwear foundation and NC 35 and using
my Urban Decay Naked skin the concealer
in the shade light warm with this eye
look we're not gonna be doing any sort
of a harsh lines or anything and
hopefully there's gonna be minimal
fallout so I'm doing the skin first and
just setting my skin it with my nas
pressed powder in beige but under my
eyes using my diffused ambient lighting
powder wait
Miami title bar the interviews like to
keep it bright underneath the eyes
to warm up my skin I'm taking this
bronzing powder from uh peaches makeup
in the shade light/medium and just
flying it where I would normally apply
my bronzer on my cheeks and on the tops
of my forehead and onto my neck as well
I was obsessed with the Inglot
shimmering duffed in the shade 0-3 for
my body and I just have to get it in the
shade zero one for my cheek so that is
my highlighter and then the blush I'm
using is from Laura Geller in the shade
Rose berry and I'm just applying that
after i pair my highlighter cuz I prefer
to blend my blusher in my highlight if I
make sense but obviously it's totally up
to you
I am literally obsessed with this
highlighter it is so so intense so if
you don't like a strong highlight date
you may but like this but for your eye
but the skin done I am moving on to my
eyes I am prepping my eyes with my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot then for the
initial transition shade I am taking
this eyeshadow from makeup geek in the
shade preppy which is a really kind of
sandy golden matte brown color and I'm
just that from inner corner to
outer corner as it is a halo eye we want
the intensity to go all the way across
from inner corner to outer corner then
using a Mac Pro Longwear eyeshadow in
uninterrupted on a fluffy flat brush I'm
just pressing this on my inner corners
and my outer corners living in my or the
center of my lid blank already or when
we go in with the lightest shade then I
am taking this amazing foiled eyeshadow
from makeup geek called untamed it is
such a gorgeous intense gold color and
just basically pressing this on top of
where we place the uninterrupted
eyeshadow but a tiny bit further in it
towards the center and then taking it
across the back of my lid as well for
the center gold lid color I am taking
this pigment by the balm in the shade no
money no honey and just pressing that
into the empty space that we left before
going in with the defined fluffy crease
brush I am just with no extra product of
buffing out the crease just so we have
no harsh edges and then going in with a
fluffier brush to make sure that
everything is really soft and diffused
then using Mac reflex gold glitter iron
prepping this all over my lid to add
that extra Sparkle and gold shimmer my
waterline and taking there's a gorgeous
of gold eyeliner from neve cosmetics in
the shade amber then from my lower lash
line i am taking the uninterrupted eye
shadow and just placing that in outer
corner and the inner corner and then
taking the untamed foiled eyeshadow and
placing that in the center and just
taking a tiny bit of the bomb pigment
and placing it on the top of that and
also in my inner corner as a highlight
then i am just applying a mascara this
is the l'oreal false lash scoped which
is incredible on its own you definitely
don't need to our lashes with this but
obviously as it's me I'm gonna be taking
this Sofia lash from velu I do have a
discount code below as always and it is
always linked so this is the finished
eye look I'm absolutely in love with
this kind of gold color schemes so onto
lips I'm taking the Electra Oryx know if
the etc pro long wear lip pencil from
Mac and just like my lips as it's quite
a brown tone nude and I did want to go
with a new with this one but kind of the
stick along with the kind of Goldy Brown
theme then using this Agatha's studded
lipstick from Mac at Bondi and just ease
meant to fill in my lips I did go back
in with the pencil afterwards and then
using the Mac left a glass and instant
gold to give it that kind of glittery
gold finish just like we did with the
eyes
so this is my finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed it make sure to
