yes
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I am doing this yellow summer
inspired glitter cut crease tutorial
recently got my hands on some of the
vivid liners from NYX and I saw the
yellow one and I was thinking why not do
something a little bit different and
this hot weather has got me feeling
really inspired to do something kind of
summer inspired so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial give it a
thumbs up if you did and yeah if you
like the look of this makeup look then
please keep watching we're gonna go
ahead and do our eyes first so I'm
already primed in and then I'm going in
with a chickadee eyeshadow from makeup
geek and a big fluffy brush and just
concentrating this kind of above my
crease as like I said this is gonna be a
cut crease tutorial so all the eye
shadows kind of want to stay above that
for now then I'm going in with I think
this is it desert sands from makeup geek
also these are all gonna be makeup each
eye shadows and I think them down below
going in with a slightly smaller crease
brush and then back in with our big
fluffy crease brush just there just to
diffuse the eyeshadows together and make
sure everything is really blended this
one is called a preppy and I'm using an
even smaller crease brush you guys can
see what I'm doing I'm just gradually
defining the crease more and more to
create that kind of cut crease look
mixing these two foiled eyeshadows
together these are fortune teller and
unattained I'm just using a really small
shader brush and using this to cut the
crease out I find it easier to kind of
drag my skin at the side as you can see
just so the product goes on a lot
smoother and I can be a lot more precise
with it then I'm going in with Mac
reflex gold and making sure I'm getting
it super damp with a mac fix+ so it has
some any adhesive fatigue to it and just
kind of packing it on so you want this
to be super glittery and super summery
and yeah this is cool to kind of really
appropriate for festivals as well so we
want it to really stand out and then I'm
going in with maka eyes shadow on a
angled brush I'm just using this to cut
the crease out just so I kind of know
where I want my liner to go and so we
have a bit more of a darker shadow to
kind of really really define the crease
I'm just kind of dragging it upward so
it's all blended together and I'm then
taking a small fluffy brush and just
making sure yeah everything is really
softly blended out and diffused because
we don't want any harsh lines with the
eye shadow because that's what we're
gonna use this for and this is the NYX
vivid liner in a vivid halo this is kind
of what inspired me to do this look I
saw it and I just kind of thought I've
not done anything with yellow or gold in
ages so yeah I'm using this to create
that cut crease look find it much easier
to look down while doing this so it
doesn't smudge and then just kind of
custom in customizing it how you want it
I have to do it slightly thicker because
I have slightly hooded eyes so if I want
it to show it needs to be slightly
thicker line as you can see but yet just
do it to whatever suits your eye shape
and looking down makes it a lot easier
and then I'm going back in with the
Mokka eyes shadow just on the top just
to really cut the crease out and define
it and then again going in with the lid
shades and just tidying everything up
then I am creating a wing using my NYC
black liquid liner like so and cleaning
up any excess from underneath then using
my favorite eyelashes from volute
they're the what the fluff style and I
do have a discount code which is Rachel
leery and you can save money off their
website with them
now on to the skin I'm using this this
works transit primer it's like a mask
moisturizer and a primer in one and it's
the first time I was using this I was
actually really impressed with it it
really made my makeup last all day and
yeah I'm just pumping that into my skin
using my Real Techniques a multitask
face brush using an old favor I'm using
Mac Studio Fix I'm not short on the
shade but I will have listed it down
below and just buffing that in up to at
the skin using my Real Techniques
buffing brush and then I'm mixing these
two NARS concealers together one in the
shade custard and one in the shade
Chantilly custard is more to kind of my
natural skin tone and Chantilly is their
palest one so I use that to highlight
with as you can see and then I'm just
blending that all into my skin using a
damp Beauty Blender
once that is all ANDed in I'm gonna set
it in place with my RC ma no color
powder and then these are the products I
used for my eyebrows let me know if you
guys want an updated brow tutorial I've
listed them all that down below then I'm
going back in with that desert sands
color and just running that along my
lower lash line and applying a bottom
lash mascara you have to ignore my eyes
I had my fan on and it was giving me the
worst watery eyes on my eyes look really
a bloodshot so ignore that please but
yet just applying some at bottom at lash
mascara and then that is the finished
eye look back onto the skin I'm using
this Mac mineralized skinfinish in dark
golden to lightly bronze all over my
skin you guys know the drill and I've
been really loving using a duo fiber
brush to do this I think it blends it so
so nicely if the skin especially once
you've set your whole face with that no
color powder I'm in love with doing this
and then I'm just contouring it using
the Bahama Mama bronzer by the balm and
a small fluffy brush I'm pretty sure
this is the Sigma e-40 and again I do
have a discount code with the Sigma
which I always leave in the description
bar down below for blush I'm using this
strictly chic ombre blusher from next I
love this one it is such a gorgeous
peachy undertone so I thought it tied in
really nicely as we're sticking to quite
warm shades and then using it this I
think it's like a strobe genius palette
or stroke of genius palette from NYX as
well on a multi brush and using this to
highlight with I haven't seen it this
palette before and I'm obsessed it is
one of my new favorite things to
highlight with and then for the lips I'm
using this NYX rose a brown lip liner
myth from Mac and then there's a glitter
gloss from sleek and this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial like I said
give it a thumbs up if you did and
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
