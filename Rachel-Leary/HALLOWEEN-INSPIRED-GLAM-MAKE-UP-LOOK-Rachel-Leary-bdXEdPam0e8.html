so today you know I don't even know like
what this is I wanted to do it like a
glam ish wearable Halloween look for
those of us that don't have time to
paint our faces but just kind of wanted
look Halloween II but more on the DRAM
side arm or the wearable side so I just
thought I'd take some inspiration from
like Halloween colors of like red orange
black do it the glam eyes something a
little bit more like funky on the lip
area which I really really really like
but use
I've used a bunch of my favorite
products I'm also wearing the new Vida
Beauty Foundation I did ask you guys if
you want a full review on it so if you
still do it let me know give this video
a thumbs up if you like the look of this
look I don't even know what it is just
literally a bunch of eyeshadows on my
face had so much fun at playing around
with glitters and all that good stuff so
yeah if you like the look of this look
make sure to give it a thumbs up and hit
that subscribe button if you haven't
already and if you want to know how I
got this look then please keep watching
so tip again I'm just gonna pry my eyes
using my concealer this one it is the
L'Oreal True Match concealer and I'm
also going to take this opportunity to
use a little brush and carve out my
eyebrows but yeah just using this as my
primer and then setting it all in place
with powder then literally taking my new
favorite palette this is the morphe 35o
weight 3502 weight volume 2 i can't
remember what it's called but the new
35o palette and it's just taking a bunch
of the warm shade so initially with a
soft brown i did kind of want it to be
more of like an orange e &amp;amp; red vibe so I
am using the brighter colors in the
palette to like that gorgeous red and
then lounges deepening it up with the
dark Browns as well and I did wanted to
go like really really dark because we
are gonna cut the crease so I wanted the
colors to show so I'm kind of using way
more crease colors than I usually would
as you can see just to build up the
color so when we cut it out its and
really really noticeable I'm even going
to use black I'm just gonna buff that
into the crease using a smaller and
smaller precise brush each time but then
always going back in with my previous
brushes to blend it out and make sure
it's all diffused together then for
cutting the crease I'm just going to
take the Anastasia Beverly Hills
concealer in the shade 1.5 I think this
is just because it's super thick and
that way it was gonna get rid of all the
shadow on my lid and it makes a really
good base and
just gonna take a wipe and wipe it away
and then going in with this shimmery
orange shade from the same palette just
packing on the color I wanted it to be
like orange pumpkin any kind of vibes so
I went for the shimmery orange and then
this incredible pigment from Petrus
makeup this isn't the shade Ruby I think
this would look really incredible or
over the lid but I did kind of want to
create a gradient at something a little
bit different but then going back and
with that little shader brush that we
used the orange on just to blend it
together and then taking a really small
brush and the black to sharpen up the
cut crease again just going back in with
that white book has made a little bit of
a mess and then just highlighting my
inner corner before we do it liquid
eyeliner and for that I'm using my NYC
liquid liner as you guys know this is
literally my favorite eyeliner but I saw
you can only get it from Amazon these
days I've left a link to everything it
down below and I kind of wanted it be
more of a thicker wing than usual so I'm
just building up the thickness but do
whatever you are comfortable with and
then we're gonna apply these amazing
lashes from pinky coat they're in the
style of our one and now we can move on
to the skin so I'm using the
extraordinary a facial oil and
moisturizer from L'Oreal because we're
going in with quite a heavy duty
foundation today so I want my skin to be
as super moisturized underneath and I've
been really loving this primer this is
from amazing cosmetics and it's their
like illuminating primer in the shade it
bronzed so it adds a little bit of color
to my skin but also an incredible glow
underneath because like I said we are
going and with a heavy duty foundation
it's the hooda beauty foundation and as
I said earlier if you guys want me to do
a a full review on this let me know
because this stuff is heavy duty which
is kind of where the color looks so so
so intense but I am gonna kind of color
out color it out you know counteract it
out with a lighter concealer and bronzer
and all that kind of good stuff so I'm
using the Loreal concealer that I used
earlier on my eyes as the primer and
just buffing that out underneath and
using a damp Beauty Blender to do this
tip for that foundation by the way defo
use a Beauty Blender because it really
helps to make it a lot more comfortable
on the skin but now I'm just setting
everything in place with powder we can
move on to up bronzer this is the NYX no
filter powder in the shade of golden I
love these for bronzers and just using a
light fluffier brush to do so and then
I've been loving this recently is the
Kat Von D it shade and light palette and
I'm just going to use that
to add a bit more definition to my
cheekbones and I love this blusher to
this is from two phases like the Papa
don't peach blusher smells like peaches
gives the most gorgeous glow to the skin
I'm obsessed and I've been loving this -
oh my god this is just everything that I
love and this is the beauty of high
super strobing like drops which I'm just
a buffing on to my cheeks it's like a a
primer and then using the Kylie
cosmetics a Fuji at loose glitter powder
highlighter love these two together it
literally makes everything just pop look
look look at it but now we can move back
onto the eyes I'm just using this pencil
from Urban Decay I've left the name of
it down below it's the most gorgeous
like burnt orange red it really makes my
eyes pop so and it ties in with the
colors on the eyes too which I love and
I'm just taking the dark brown shades
that we use from the same palette to
buff that out and then taking the big
fluffy brush that I used it the red on
just to really it smoke it out and add
an extra dramatic effect as you can see
so these are the eyes done and now we
can move on to the lips I'm just going
to line my lips with a Mac brick lip
liner and then I'm gonna go in with via
to a face and melted lipstick I think
it's in the color and mrs. Roper this
gorgeous orange which went perfectly
with the eyes and the shirt I was
wearing it might I add and then is
totally up to you I just start having a
play around with my fluffy brushes and
just kind of picking up the warm red
eyeshadows this is the orange that we
had on the lid ultim the same palette
that's the highlighter I was wearing too
and then I just evened it up with the
black from the palette as well but it's
totally up to you but this is the
finished look
so this was the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial I feel you could totally mix up
the colors and news like purples and
greens or just like all blacks and reds
maybe not with the orange also so if you
guys recreate it definitely and make
sure to tighten you because you guys
recreated Maya Pennywise and melted
clown look and I've been seeing those
are so many of it I love it when you
guys recreate my look so definitely make
sure to tag me definitely make sure to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe before
you leave if you haven't already and
