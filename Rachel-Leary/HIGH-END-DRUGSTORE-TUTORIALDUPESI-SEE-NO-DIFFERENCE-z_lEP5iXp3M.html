not only is this gonna be a makeup
tutorial this video could save you some
serious money if you like the sound of
that give this video a thumbs up already
today we're gonna be doing a half
high-end half drugstore makeup tutorial
slash juice basically all the drugstore
all kind of affordable products that
I've found a dupes of higher-end
products that we all know and love seen
them all over Instagram and stuff but
just have never saved enough money to
get them this is the video for you
literally can you even see a difference
in my face right now
take a moment to guess already which
side is the higher-end side and which
side is via drugstore side and it may be
so by the end of the video if you're
right before we continue it is
notification bell shout out time and
this week the notification bell shout
out goes to Kara Curran that said a
notification bell on fab makeup as
always love you thank you so much Keira
I love you and I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial if you're watching if you want
to transfer shout out make sure you hit
the subscribe button get the
notification bell and let me know if
you've either come from my notification
bells or that you've just turned them on
but without further ado if you want to
save yourself literally 300 pounds and
get this look we've got unreason here
we've got Hooda dupes in here we've got
wire Sal dupes and here tar cubes and
here we've got all the dupes so get
ready
let's go
okay so to begin I now I have a a super
tan face I'm just genuinely quite turned
right now and it's decided to stick
around my lips okay okay so let's prime
our face I feel like which side should
be so this is going to be my high end
site and this is going to be at my
drugstore side and I tried to pick
products that were going to be a dupes
for each other which means they should
have the complete same effect and I feel
like they look the same
they should apply the same it's really
there should be no difference so for my
high end primer I'm going to be using
the YSL all ours primer and for the
drugstore side I'm going to be using the
NYX total control drops primer now both
of these have really like a milky finish
and they really smooth out the skin
I do actually find that the next one is
slightly a more hydrating it feels
slightly more hydrating and kind of a
bit more sticky which is why preferring
a primer whereas the YSL or ours primer
is kind of more of that milky smooth
kind of finish but still works I feel
like just as well I actually love both
of those our primers so much and I feel
like they both work just as well as each
other but literally a fraction of the
price is mad so moving on to foundations
because I'm going out of this I want a
long wearing full coverage foundation
probably gonna be pictures taken you
know I want my skin to be looking good
so I've decided to use the Buddha beauty
of foundation as my high-end foundation
and the dupe for that is the maybelline
superstay foundation both of these have
like a super full matte coverage they
both lost amazingly on the skin probably
because they are so full coverage are
obviously a fellow coverage foundation
tends to last longer because it's
slightly thicker the huda beauty
foundation I do find it slightly more
kind of tacky and sticky and that kind
of makes a little bit more long wearing
as well but I do I love the fact that
the Maybelline one is so full coverage
but it's a little bit more easy to apply
and again it still has the like long
wearing qualities to it so this is the
coverage of the hooter foundation
literally it's so airbrushed and
incredible it is good to throw a filter
foundation so obviously it would imply
that it just gives the appearance of a
filter on the skin which I literally
feel like it does if you suffer from
breakouts or anything like that this is
such an incredible foundation for the
coverage
and now let's compare with the
Maybelline I'm hoping the color is going
to be fairly similar otherwise I'm gonna
be looking for not gonna lie guys I
literally can't even see a difference
not even in the color on this side I
used one pump of latte and then one pump
of Tralee Chaitra leeches something like
that because I just needed to the lucky
one was too light and the trader cher
thought was gonna be a little bit too
yellow and then this side is the
Maybelline in caramel beige and then
literally I didn't okay let's move on to
concealer I feel like this has been the
biggest kind of spoken about dupe over
the past couple of months so the
high-end concealer I'm going to be using
is the Attar shape tape and the dupe for
that I'm going to be using is the makeup
revolution conceal and defined concealer
I've never actually compared them both
of my face I never did one of those
videos so I'm so excited to see if there
really like is a difference so this side
I'm using the shade medium again this is
a super full coverage concealer I'm
obsessed I will I used to be just so
obsessed with the formula this one it
was honestly it is still honestly
amazing and this side I'm gonna use the
shade c7 they're so comparable
especially with their brushes I feel
like this c7 shade is a little bit
lighter but we'll make it work and we'll
make it work feel like we've got some
artwork going on okay let's blend it
does give the most amazing coverage
insane
that's the taut shape tape all blended
out and now let's go ahead and blend out
the make a revolution Wow literally when
you apply them side by side there is
honest-to-god no difference and if that
makeup revolution concealer is only at
four pounds and for us in the UK
slightly more accessible than tar shape
tape a hundred percent
save your money in four pounds I'm soul
sister okay moving on it to a good old
cream up contour for my high-end side
I'm gonna be using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills cream contour kit in LA
and a new baby for me this is for the
drug suicide the new NYX cream a contour
kit as well I think I'm just gonna be a
mixing these kind of two at shades here
for my contour color on this side I
think from experience I'm just gonna be
using it this color here from the NYX
cream contour kit as well so let's start
off with annastolz you're just gonna be
contouring the areas that I want to you
know reduce slightly half a nose why not
and then I'm just gonna take I brush
like this before the next side I will
say with the Anastasi at Beverly Hills
one you do kind of need to apply a bit
of like facial oil into it before you
use it just to warm up the product not
that there's anything wrong with that
all I'm kind of a little bit off with
the coloring again whereas the next one
is kind of creamy off the map okay so
let's just start the blending these are
of a slightly cooler nature because I
want them to be more of a cream a cream
contour rather than a cream bronze
because I'm just gonna apply my bronze
out with as like a powder form but I do
love the way that the Anastasio ones
blend out I think they kind of blend
almost into your skin and just look so
natural as you can see I just think that
looks so pretty
and then let's go ahead and do mix the
color of the next one I feel like
remains slightly more if that makes
sense
I can't even tell the difference in
anything that I've done it might be more
of a koware factor test I got I
literally wig off okay now we can move
on to a setting the face so I'm gonna go
ahead and use the Too Faced Born This
Way translucent setting powder and the
makeup revolution lace luxury baking
powder they're pretty much the same
thing I mean translucent powders of
translucent powders but I think this one
might be slightly more of a pink
undertone I was gonna use a slightly
pink of powder for the higher-end one
but all the ones I
I couldn't find like in stock anywhere
I'm hoping that this one student stock
as well so I'm just gonna go ahead and
bake away it with my two face powder and
just sharpen the contour I must say I
I'm a massive fan of the two-faced
powders I think they're amazing and now
I'm just gonna take the makeup
revolution powder okay it doesn't any
more like a brightening quality but to
be fair this one does state that this
one is more of a baking powder I can't
say that this side feels slightly
tighter as if it's like absorbing
more product maybe but we're just gonna
leave that to a baked for a little bit
and I'm gonna zoom you in and do
eyebrows now okay so for my eyebrows I'm
gonna be taking for my higher inside the
Anastasio beverly hills dipbrow in dark
brown and for my drugstore side I'm
going to be taking the makeup revolution
at brow pomade in dark brown as well so
these are literally like a doop doop
doop de doop doop doop doop de doop I'm
gonna start off with the Anastasio /
made the color of it is a super neutral
dark brown it's not too warm and it's
not too great I love it now we can go on
to our drugstore side so this is the
makeup revolution brow pomade in a dark
brown they both applied really really
like
similarly Lily Lily if I'm really
looking right now this one is slightly
over more grayer undertone maybe in this
one in comparison is slightly warm up in
terms of the formula and the way that
they apply exactly the same okay so we
can wipe away the powders like they both
look exactly the same
I don't know if you can really like tell
ones not like dried me out more than the
other or anything like that they both
feel like sufficiently it's sad I'm so
impressed I'm so glad I've done this
video because I never save myself some
money from now and you know to mean okay
we can continue on with the skin now so
this is another tip that I've definitely
it's spoken about before and it's for
bronzers so for the high-end side I'm
going to be using
the Matt Miller eyes natural skin finish
in a dark golden literally one of my
favorite bronzers ever and for the
drugstore side I'm gonna be taking the
NYX and no filter powder in gold and
they're honestly they kind of look
different in color they're literally
exactly the same I feel like a concept
of them as well are very similar they're
both face powders but I've just chosen
to use a slightly darker color so it
will act as a bronzer for me but they
both work incredibly on the skin and
blend into the skin because they are
just meant to be facial powders of that
make sense they also have a lot more of
a natural undertone a lot less red if
you don't if sometimes you're finding
your bronzer looks really like
reddy-orange you should try a skin
powder in a slightly more darker color
because they tend to be a bit more on
the yellow or golden side I just think
it looks so much more like a natural
color and this is the NYX no filter
powder in golden they both applied
exactly the same they're both are very
buildable bones of which I like because
you know that moment when you swallow
your brush around and then put it onto
your face and you're like oh crap how
the hell am I gonna blend that out so
it's quite hard to go overboard with
these kind of face powder bronzer type
things they just blend so effortlessly
into the skin I'm obsessed I'm obsessed
okay so a big blusher guilt for the
high-end blusher I'm going to be taking
the amok Beauty blusher in lines and
last night it's a really gorgeous
apricot peach you kind of when mixed
together and has the most gorgeous glow
and I thought the best dupe for this was
the blusher in Luminoso by Milani now I
know this is kind of only available in
the drugstore in the if you're in the US
but it's so so so affordable it's almost
like a drugstore price so I'm just going
to be taking my brush and swirl in it
our right hand and you just apply it to
the apples such a gorgeous glow so these
kind of peachy colors are amazing so I'm
now just gonna whoa take the livin oh so
a blusher okay this one definitely yeah
it's giving me more like a a highlight
okay so in terms of blusher I definitely
prefer the mark Beauty one because you
can see that's just I've never really
backed as a blush or anybody get much
color from that speaking of glow I'm
gonna be applying a
we're eliminated before a powdered
illuminator and my powder highlighter
dupe is so good and I feel like you guys
are gonna love it but for my high-end
side of liquid eliminator I'm going to
be taking the Anastasio at Beverly Hills
the peach fears liquid glow and to do
that I'm going to take the Maybelline
and master crime at strobing liquid in
medium Nereid so I'm just going to take
a little bit of the Anastasia on the
back of my hand and take like a little
duo fiber brush I do have to say I do
love that one now I'm gonna take the
Maybelline master chrome in a medium
nude and apply it on this side guys I'm
telling you the only one that I found
with a difference is the blusher but
maybe I could have found found like a
better dupe but so far my skin literally
looks exactly the same on either side
and finally for the skin this is
probably like my best do Oh
but for the high inside I'm gonna be
taking the Anastasi of Beverly Hills and
reesy highlighter and for the affordable
side I'm gonna be taking it the Milani
instant glow powder they even have the
same wave I will say though the
Anastacio Beverly Hills one is just like
insane in terms of the packaging the
fact that you know you're going to be
matching with amrezy is enough just to a
buyer on its own plus it's literally
insane but if you want to mimic that
amazing glow and you can't afford it to
get the real and reesy this one from
Milani I swear it's not like that big on
my skin but they're literally pretty
much the same in color and had the same
effect okay so this is our super glowy
skin
complete and which by the way I can't
see a difference in at all I know I keep
saying it but like I'm now going to go
ahead and do my eyes unfortunately I
know so so
knowing with the fact I've got lash
extensions on right now I'm quite
restricted in what I make up I can do
and I am going to an event after this so
please forgive me it is gonna be a dark
coppery I I know I know I know if you do
want more colored looks let me know and
if so using what and everything else
down below but it's just because I'm
going out after this I'm just gonna do a
super wearable look plus it's due to
some of my favorite everyday products
which you guys might appreciate as well
these forgive me so I think I'm going to
go ahead and like do one I completely
all the high-end products so I don't
have to keep dabbling my brushes in
different ones I'll do one whole eye
with all the high-end products and I'm
going to show you exactly how to do the
same eye with the lower end products and
then we can compare okay so this is
obviously at my higher-end eye one of my
fav everyday matte eyeshadow palettes to
use is the Too Faced just peachy let's
open it up like matte eyeshadow palette
this is honesty gorgeous is perfectly
traveling and like your crease colors
because they're all matte shades like I
said I am gonna be doing a all matte eye
so I'm just gonna be taking working from
light to dark I'm just going to be
taking the color peach tea which is just
a super light warm brown then I'm gonna
take the kind of next darkest shade
which is called a fresh picked on a
slightly smaller brush and just pop that
kind of more all over the lid this is
where I'm going to be starting to apply
colors all over the lid so I'm now gonna
take the color peach cobbler again just
making my way making my way through the
dark nails again focusing on the
outermost part but bringing it up into
the crease just like so and then finally
I'm going to be at taking the color
peach tart just honest even smaller
fluffier brush focusing this mainly on
the outer most part of the eye I'm not
gonna bring this color so much into the
crease cuz I want it to look kind of
more elongated so and you kind of take
me out halfway
I love the way that looks
I'm just gonna take a pencil brush and
take that peach cobbler shade which was
a medium warm brown and just run that
along like so just to connect it all
together and then in the waterline I'm
going to be taking the Urban Decay 24/7
the wire sell of vinyl picture mascara
in number four black in a corner
highlighter I'm gonna take the color
peach meringue from the palette which is
like the matte white shade and lightly
underneath the brow so that is the
high-end eye complete and now we can
move on to doing exactly the same but
with a fraction of the price and then we
can see if there's any different in the
eye shadows hate to save you guys some
boredom this is the part that I use it's
the NYX warm neutral palettes and I just
went from light to dark literally
mimicking the same eyeshadow look I then
to the next 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in
warm bronze and the Maybelline total
temptation mascara as the wire sell dupe
as well to create the finished and
literally identical eyelid so these are
the eyes completed can you see much of a
difference because I definitely can't I
mean I do think I prefer the peach
palette in general in terms of like the
smell and the warmness of the warm tones
but on the seat there's really nothing
in at all okay so moving on to the lip I
thought this would be fun because I like
the queen of nude lips so the fact that
I can find dupes just makes everything
so much better for me and for you guys
so for the high-end side I'm gonna be
taking the Charlotte Tilbury lip cheat
in iconic nude and it's dupe is the
colour-pop lippie pencil in beeper I
know again this isn't a drugstore kind
of product but it's a drugstore prices
literally five dollars which for us is
three pounds or likes something which is
insane once you see they're like pigman
so that's Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude
I must say is a very creamy blendable
pencil but now let's do the color pop
beeper
the blend ability of them is literally
the same moving on it to lipstick from I
high-end side I'm gonna be it taking on
my favorite matte lipsticks this is
honey love I love the color of them
together and the dupe that I found is
the Maybelline GG lipstick in McCall
unfortunately I couldn't find us in
stock online but I found them a call
lipliner online so filling in your lips
with that would have the exactly the
same effect because they're the same
color I swear you could never even tell
and I am gonna apply a gloss because I
did find a really good joob the high-end
side that I'm going to be using is the
skinny dip lip topper in right now the
jus a lip topper in skinny dip and on my
drugstore side I'm gonna be using the
l'oreal dazzle glass in disco ball i
swear that it was the same but that's
the finished makeup look so this was the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this and found this really
informative because I can honestly say I
see no difference like they both feel
and look exactly the same in my eyes I
don't feel like I just did one half
high-end and one half drugstore like at
all
they both performed exactly the same I
mean I'll always have my favorites in
the back of my mind in terms of which
ones I would reach for more on a
day-to-day basis but honestly if you're
looking for that glam high-end look and
want those high-end products this just
goes to show that you do not need to
spend the money and you can look exactly
the same
if you like to the concept of this video
give it a thumbs up and let me know if
you've wanted to purchase any of the
higher-end products that I mentioned but
put in and now I've found you a juice so
let me know if I've helped you out girl
but thank you guys so so so much for
watching and until the next video I will
see you then
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
