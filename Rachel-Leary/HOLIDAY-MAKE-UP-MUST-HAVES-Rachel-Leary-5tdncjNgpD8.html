feel like I haven't actually sat down
and filmed live for like ages cuz the
last few videos that I filmed were
pre-recorded before I went on a holiday
so this video is kind of really
appropriate because now I know as you
can tell by the title the kind of makeup
must-haves that I had on my holiday and
I asked you guys the other day what you
wanted to see and so so so many of you
said what makeup my typical holiday or
what must-have products I would
recommend to take on holiday makeup wise
so that is what I'm going to show you
today a box of things right here of kind
of things I've put together and that I
think of see you don't have to use this
exact specific ones these are just my
kind of ideas of what to bring and then
these are what specific ones I brought
if that makes any sense whatsoever so
starting with base I would probably
recommend bringing to face products so
either two foundations or a foundation
and a BB cream or foundation in tinted
moisturizer or something it's kind of
more like a day and night I know loads
of people like don't even wear face
makeup on holiday but if you're like me
and you like to wear see face makeup
most of the time then the two that I
bought were Mac face and body for the
day and then my cover effects it's the
natural finish oil-free foundation for
the night time so this one is a really
really lightweight foundation it's
water-resistant as well so it's good
during humidity this one doesn't have
any SPF in it so it's really good for
pictures but so make sure to put some
cream on beforehand if you're wearing it
throughout the day so your skin still
stays protective but protective
protected but like I said this one is
super super lightweight and it is so
easy to wear it adds a really cool just
like tint to your skin I have to color
at c3 so it had a bit of a tan to it
because I don't actually tan in the Sun
so I always fake tan so I need it to be
able to match that and like I always say
I never really like to apply fake tan to
my face so this just gives me a bit of
cut up but nothing too heavy during the
day that I feel like it's sweating off
and just feels like horrible on my skin
and then like I said for the night
I like to have something a bit more
full-coverage something that's gonna
withstand the heat something that's
gonna withstand like you're going
partying all your going out or something
like that this is a really good one it's
oil-free so it's got a matte finish to
it it's full coverage so make sure that
you're you're saying kind of like cool
while you're applying it otherwise you
get into a hot sweaty mess and kind of
gross but I found this one to stay on my
skin throughout the night and especially
if I set it with powder my skin makeup
looks like flawless so I really
recommend this one and because it's
oil-free it looks really really good in
pictures speaking of like tanning and
all that stuff you guys know I'm
obsessed with like body shimmers and
fake tanning and stuff and these are the
two products that I literally lived for
on holiday and it is the loving tan
bronze cream all right the loving turn
bronze shimmer luminous cream in dark so
this is essentially like an instant
tanner but it has a bit of a shimmer to
it so it gives you a really gorgeous
glow to the skin and I know it comes in
medium dark and ultra dark but I took
dog meat add a bit of color I applied
fake tan while I was out there as in
like mousse but then sometimes it was
starting to wear off I just needed a bit
more color this was amazing to give me a
bit of shimmer as well but if you want
it to like a glow from the Gods and I
know I did this Inglot sparkling dust
you can use it on your face eyes
whatever it's phenomenal this one isn't
actually the color that I took I can't
find one like oh but this one I think I
took the color 0-3 so it's a bit more of
a deep bronze golden color but these are
phenomenal like it says you can use on
your eyes as well so it saves you
packing an extra like eyeshadow or
something like that saves a lot of room
I know I used it on my eyes on a couple
of nights because I love a bronze
shimmery eye but this just all over like
your décolletage area unlike your legs
or anything like that just gave you that
like blow factor it's amazing especially
if you don't like applying like oils and
stuff
oils give you that kind of ultimate
globe if you just wanted to like a
really quickly lightly doesn't thing
these are so so so good and they have I
think four colors so even if you're
slightly paler than me like this zero
one
zero one month just ones in the shades
very one you can see it's more like a
light bronze color so even us naturally
paler girls can glow too and works
really nice as a cheek highlight moving
on to eye products I think I must have
product for me is a waterproof mascara
this one is the hot and naughty one from
Mac and it's like a two-in-one one that
makes sense it has two ones one has like
a really light fluffy kind of one shape
doesn't pick up a huge amount of product
so it's perfect for the daytime because
I know sometimes during the day when
it's really hot sometimes mascara can
transfer underneath so this one gives a
really nice amount of product on the
lashes kind of creates more of a light
fluffy lash and then it doubles up and
you pick up a lot more product and it's
a lot thicker wand so that one's amazing
for the night time as well I found this
amazing on days that I just kind of
wanted to not really wear any makeup so
I probably put my Mac face and body on
and then a bit of mascara and obviously
waterproof in the heat works wonders and
also if you're going swimming and stuff
this one is amazing also I found like
curling my lashes as well on a day to
day just if because if you like me I
love wearing lashes all the time but
sometimes in the heat or if you're in a
rush I go really can't be bothered but I
have naturally really short eyelashes so
these half lash curlers from Mac I found
are amazing to just kind of curl your
lashes give a bit more shape to them and
then obviously applying your mascara and
it just opens your eyes up a lot more
like if you were wearing a pair of false
lashes speaking of which I really
struggled on deciding what lashes to
bring on holiday because I have so many
and I love so many pairs of lashes bar
in boots or super drug these oiler
lashes of three for two so I made sure
to stock up on these before I went and I
just got three pairs of the eye lower
lashes this one is in one to six or
doing a little closer so you can see
they're super full and dramatic so these
ones I kind of thought will morph like
the nighttime I also really like I think
it's the one 4:9 style of a one six nine
or so
like that but I made sure to pick up
three of these because I'll see they're
not super expensive and they were on
three - so if you don't know which -
just bring aisle ones I love them
deciding what I shadows to bring was
also a massive thing for me and I did
limit myself to I think two pallets but
this one was definitely the most useful
this is the violet Boss holy grail
pallet and it's filled with colors I
knew I could do loads with and it's
super thin and super lightweight as well
so it was perfect for traveling and
perfect - kind of like fit in my makeup
in my suitcase without adding any extra
weight and the best thing is that it has
a big mirror and I totally forgot to
bring a mirror with me on holiday so
this came in it's so so handy and yet
like I said it's filled with colors I
knew I was going to wear everyday my
warm tones are my favorites
and there's matte and shimmer shades in
there like too dark so I could do things
in the day and the night time and like I
said it's super thin and lightweight so
perfect for traveling if you can get
your hands on this definitely do it next
up is a couple of lip products now I
could have bought so so so many types of
lip products but but what I found I
gravitated towards the most was a nude
lip and then a bright lip so both of
these are from lip land and I do have a
discount code and I will leave it down
below but obviously use whatever ones
that you want this one is spotlight and
it is a nude it is amazing and I find
liquid lipsticks to last the longest
time like if you're eating drinking
going out you're talking loads of people
I definitely recommend liquid lipsticks
I think they are the best they have the
best staying power and they're just that
if you're trying to minimalize your
packaging packaging if you're trying to
minimalize your packing and like not
bring too many I would bring a nude and
a bright just because you can't go wrong
so bring your favorite nude and your
favorite bright so this one is spotlight
from lip land and it is one of the new
amrezy ones it is it was my go-to on
holiday I was applying it all the time
with lip liner and then maybe like a
gloss on top or something but it was my
go-to nude lipstick I'm obsessive this
at the moment
I'm definitely going to post a bit more
about this on Instagram because it's
like my favorite liquid lipstick of all
time and then for a bright wise is
Brooklyn
also from the amrezy collection it's
like it's right Coralie kind of color so
these colors I find complement my eyes
the most and if I want a statement lip I
tend to normally gravitate towards red
tones and stuff so this kind of bright
coral screamed of me and I thought if I
wanted to take a bright color I'll just
play it safe and take this with bright
colors on a holiday I definitely
recommend staying a matte just because
they're probably the easiest they like I
said they stay on the best and with
bright ones you really don't want it to
smudge or anything like that so I would
avoid a gloss but obviously do whatever
you want these are the two that I bought
with me and like I said especially if
you're trying to minimalize your packing
and you try to go lightweight I would
just go like a nude and a bright and a
liquid lipstick form and last but not
least I know this is probably really bad
in the sense that people I know some
people have like religious skincare
routines but I know for me on holiday
especially if I was going on like a
party on a day like the one that I went
on your skin does take a bit of a
battering in the sense that you're
probably wearing a lot of makeup each
night but I literally just don't have
the time to do like my full skincare
routine after a night out I think like
okay I'll always always always take my
makeup off but to do a full remove
makeup cleanse tone moisturize and stuff
if I if I've gone on like they say that
got party holiday and I've come back for
a night out the odds are I probably
can't even see what I'm doing or
anything like that so I just need to
take my makeup off quick and just pass
out so I found these makeup wipes these
are from simple and they're kind of skin
cleansing ones and this is a limited
edition packaging I think these are
quite new
these ones remove even waterproof makeup
and they're super super I'm like
nourishing and moisturizing on the skin
so that I don't find that they're
tugging at my skin or anything like that
they're super moist and super damp so
they removed literally everything like I
said even waterproof makeup so you keep
in mind waterproof mascara and stuff
this is gonna get it off the quickest
that it can without like really kind of
being harsh on your skin so these were a
lifesaver for me on a holiday and yeah
like I said they're super kind to your
skin so don't feel bad about taking your
makeup off good wipes but that is
everything for this video I could have
done a lot more in terms of like beauty
related stuff I did just kind of want to
stick to makeup and show you the makeup
must-haves cuz I know that is what I
struggle with when I come when it comes
to packing because there's so much to
choose from and you don't want to over
pack us half the time you don't even use
half the stuff that you use and I always
find I'm always doing like the same
looks on holiday because I just can't be
bothered and then I regret packing like
the whole of my makeup collection and I
wonder what my suitcase looks like 25
kilograms over what it should be yeah I
