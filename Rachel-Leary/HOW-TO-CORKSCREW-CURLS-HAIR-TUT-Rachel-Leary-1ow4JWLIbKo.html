to my channel sir a highly highly
requested video had some fun
experimenting with my hair the other day
and took some pictures and you guys also
saw it in my previous Valentine's Day
video you guys seem to be obsessed with
this hair and it was like my most highly
requested video to do so I thought why
not fill this for you guys I think this
is gonna be like a short ish kind of
video cuz it's actually really really
simple it's more about what you're using
rather than how you're doing it like I
said it's super easy to follow through
so we hope you guys enjoy that but as
you guys know we do a notification Belle
at shout outs on at this channel so you
didn't already know once you hit that
subscribe button or if you have hit that
subscribe button just double check in
your notification about this on if it's
not hit it now and leave a comment down
below telling me that you've done so
just like Olivia 98 did she left me a
comment saying notification Belle is on
love you sis look it's a girl doesn't go
unnoticed so if you like the look of
this kind of corkscrew a messy a hair
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
subscribe if you haven't already and
make sure you're following me on my
socials but without further ado you want
to see how I got this hair just keep on
watching
okay so to begin this is just kind of
like my not like natural hair but I
haven't styled it in a few days and I
haven't washed it in a few days and for
me when curling up my hair I don't want
to have washed it for a few days because
then the curls have really good hold so
that's a good number one tip don't do it
on a freshly washed hair because then
you're gonna get like uncontrollable
frizz and like really like fluffy frizz
and Kyle's don't really tend to hold
that well I think I'm just gonna hit my
hips and take em out Boosh
just brush through my hair darling get
all those knots out but we are gonna use
some key protecting because y'all gonna
be applying obviously a lot of heat to
our hair and this is from easy locks
this is the hair protector oil I love
this my hair is super super dry so using
a heat protector oil is amazing for that
and it acts like a lot of moisture back
into my hair also this smells amazing I
love anything that makes my hair smell
good as well kind of avoid the roots
just kinda wanna pet the ends mainly
okay once our hair is all moisture and
protected we can now move on it to
cutting the hair so I'm gonna tie kind
of one side up and I'll do half my head
you see you guys couldn't really see the
difference in it so I think with this
look is all about the tools that you use
and the cutting one that I'm using is
the Bellamy hair six in one one and this
is the 13 millimeter one so this is
gonna do super super tight curls and get
really get that kind of volume eyes
corkscrew effects if you can't get hold
of this one I know I think mark he'll do
every similar one you makes me just want
any ones that has a really really thin
barrel like I said this one is thirty
millimeters and the key is also you want
to kind of do it in lots of little
layers I find that to be the most
effective way of doing it so I'm just
gonna leave myself a little bit of hair
down below and clip this bit up and
again with the size of chunk of hair as
well you want to really keep it fairly
small and then just wrapping it around
like so and just make your way around
you want to kind of hold the curls for
like maybe 10 to 15 seconds I do have it
on a fairly high heat so that's
basically one that layer done and you
just want to basically repeat the whole
thing it's a really easy process but
like I said it's always all about the
tools that you use I do find it easier
to just keep each layer separated so not
like overwhelmed with her so just tie
that one back chug it behind and let
another bit of hair come down
so now we can just move on to the second
layer
so that is the whole of the left side
don't I'm not just gonna pull this out
yeah
so because the curls are so tight they
do have some volume on their own but I
am NOT just gonna add some volume by
adding some texture mist so this is by a
company called hair by McKnight and this
is the cool girl barely their texture
mist and what I'm gonna do with this
it's kind of really spray it up into the
roots and that you can see is gonna
really give you that lift and kind of
like natural frizz but controlled vibes
I'm literally obsessed with this hair
and to lock it all in place
I am just gonna brush through kind of
with my fingers a little bit just so
some of them aren't so tight and they
drop and then once I've kind of got them
to a cover
I'm a kind of happy and comfortable with
I'm gonna lock the one in place and
spray them in place using the way memory
mist this it's like the best hairspray
I've tried it's so good it really does
look everything in but it's so easy to
brush out and obsessed with it so I'm
just gonna spray my hair with that young
hair okay so now one half of the hair is
done I'm gonna go ahead and do the other
half and then we could have done it I'm
gonna go ahead and show you how I style
and all that kind of good stuff so be
right back okay we're back we have done
the other side of our hair so we're
going to take the same steps again
taking the hair by Samak night cool
girls texturizing spray and then under
those roots and then once we're happy
again
we have the completed yeah it's up to
you how you then what a styler I
remember when I first kind of was doing
this with my handle it she was playing
around there for hours cuz I styled my
hair always in the middle parting I kind
of think it looks better in like a kind
of side parching maybe like a big poofy
like fringe type vibe other
I can put my hips back in now and this
is the finished look so this is the
finished head look I really hope you
