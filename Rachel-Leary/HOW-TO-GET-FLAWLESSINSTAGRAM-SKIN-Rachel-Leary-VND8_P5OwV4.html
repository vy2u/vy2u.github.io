welcome back to my channel today we are
doing a kind of flawless base Instagram
skin worthy skin routine basically all
my favourite products I used to create
filtered looking at skin ready for the
gram and just like my full coverage
foundation routine you guys kind of know
I'm talking about basically a real live
face gym I'm going to be talking you
through my skincare all the way through
to my favorite products and some
techniques in between the icon is get
the best out of the product so I really
hope you guys enjoy this video and find
it useful I'm going to be using it some
hyped about products as well that I know
you guys are going to want to see in
action so that sounds good
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
already so I know you love it but before
we get cracking it's time for our
notification bell shout out time shout
out tap shout out turn oh yeah and this
week it goes to a Monica Grum I think
who says subscribed a notification bell
is on it you are so beautiful and love
the lip from Nepal oh my god Nepal thank
you so much my god your comment doesn't
go unnoticed and it is highly highly
appreciated so without further ado if
you want to see what products I use and
how I achieved this I would say really
flawless looking skin base then please
keep on watching
alright let's get started so if you want
your skin to look its best you have to
kind of prep it the best way you can as
well it doesn't matter what products you
use if you've not like prepped your skin
right it's never gonna look as good as
you want and it's especially good to use
products tailored to your skin type as
well there's no point using a super
super hydrating moisturizer because I'm
raving about it if you've got really
oily skin because you already have
enough hydration so in that scenario you
probably want to use something a little
bit more mattifying less oils that kind
of thing if you are like me and you have
kind of normal to dry skin this
moisturizer is one of my favorites it is
the glam glow water burst hydrated glow
and moisturizer I'm not 100% sure it's
available in the UK yet I haven't linked
it down below on a Sephora site it'll
definitely be coming very very soon
there are other kind of alternatives
like this as you can see from the
texture it's one of those kind of like
wet to skin moisturizers that you know I
love and a Garnier do one I no less do
one it's that kind of vibe smells
amazing and just really really hydrates
my skin perfectly if I know I'm gonna be
wearing a lot of makeup okay next up is
Primus so if you're primer today I'm
going to be using the pur correcting
primer and this is the hydrating and
balanced one I love Primus that are
slightly more wet to the skin just like
my moisturizers because again I love to
feel the hydration in my skin if I'm
gonna be wearing a lot of a makeup and I
love this one because not only is it
really hydrating it leaves a little bit
of attack afterwards as well and that's
another quality that I love in a primer
when it has a little bit of a tacky
finish because then I know anything that
I put on the top is gonna be a super
like oh no it's gonna like cling to it a
lot and I know do a big range of these
correcting primers this just so happens
to be the hydrating and balanced one
this is actually oil-free and silicone
free so if you do have oily skin this
one still might work for you in the
sense that it's not got any added oils
and it is not going any silicone in it
but it's gonna still hydrate your skin
but still hopefully and make your makeup
last longer I always kind of like to let
my skin care products soak in for a
couple of minutes just before I apply my
makeup just so it doesn't just kind of
sit it has a chance for your skin to
literally absorb it take it and go and
perform the best that it can so we're
just gonna wait like a couple of minutes
if you're finding that your makeups not
lasting as long and you're thinking oh
actually when I do I put on my skincare
and my primer I'd literally apply my
foundation straightaway that might be
the reason why because it's your skin's
not had a chance to kind of absorb it
and take it in and like it's not ready
for you to move on to the next product
yet maybe you don't have to wait a
couple of minutes but at least like you
know 30 seconds to two minutes at least
just give your skin a chance to soak it
up okay moving on to a foundation I have
so many at full coverage foundations
that I love I say full coverage just
because in order to get that Instagram
looking amazing flawless skin unless you
have naturally flawless skin I feel like
something with a bit of coverage is
going to really help you give the
illusion that you do and one that I've
been loving at the moment that you guys
have been so excited for me to try test
and show you is the makeup revolution
foundation stick this is only 5 pounds
don't be under the impression that full
coverage means it has to be really
expensive because this is incredible it
applies full coverage off the bat is a
satin finish and it's super super creamy
and so easy to blend as you can see I'm
a so obsessive that at the moment I've
only recently got my hands on it and
it's become an instant favorite it is
literally that good is online on super
drug and now but I think it's gonna be
in stores from the 28th of March so get
excited it comes to America in April
honestly like this stuff is insane and
the way I love to apply this is with
anything with like a flat top so I'm
actually using a sponge from Maybelline
that has a flat top but feel free to use
like a kabuki brush or something like
that just anything with a flat top is
we're just gonna push the product into
your skin so I don't know why I'm doing
that it's gonna really push the product
into your skin and get the maximum
amount of coverage from it I just
thought I would take a moment to just
kind of zoom in and show you what that
looks like on the sea I'm so impressed
with the coverage I do love the formula
of most foundation sticks anyway there's
something I don't really like but
honestly as someone would like dry to
dehydrated skin some foundation sticks
can actually be quite dry this is such a
creamy satin formula lens like a dream
as you can see and it's on a seed like a
such an incredible coverage I'm so
excited for you guys we have to get your
hands on
and you can write now if you order
online I have actually done a swatch
video of all 18 shades of this
foundation on my Instagram so go ahead
and check that out I call link it down
below now moving on to concealer there
are so many amazing concealers out there
at the moment like it's a rock but one
I've been seeing a lot of Instagram
makeup artists use and one that I know
that I used to love and like haven't
reached for in a while but it's still so
incredible is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer this one is in the shade canal
I love love love the finish of this I
love the formula I don't know why I
don't reach for this one so much as I do
just because I guess I'm always just
testing new ones or whatever but
honestly loads of people on Instagram
use this normally Pro makeup artists and
like when I see the finished skin of
like that gorgeous like bronze like ah
they always seem to have used this so
I've been reaching for this a lot more
and it's safe to say that I've fallen
back in love with it you've never tried
a NARS concealer before or actually
they're new a long way radiant
foundation is also a bomb
Quorn definitely go in and give it a
swatch they have an amazing color range
as well I love love love the formula of
this and they actually do like mini
travel sized versions so if yours dick
if you're a little nervous to take the
plunge and spend that money instantly
there's a little travel sized version as
well so you can test it before you buy
it why also love about that concealer is
that it gives amazing coverage and a
really nice kind of glow but without
feeling too thick there are some
concealers that give my obviously
amazing coverage but because they give
amazing coverage
it feels really thick and heavy on the
skin and it feels like it's gonna crease
and all that kind of stuff so this I
feel just sits like comfortably on my
skin now I know some people don't
necessarily like this step but I
definitely prefer cream contouring over
powder contouring I love a good cream
bronzer especially which is kind of I'm
going to be using today and again I'm
going to be taking the makeup revolution
of foundation stick this one just in the
shade F 13 so a little bit darker just
because the blend ability is incredible
this is a really like warm deeper shade
blends amazingly obviously into the skin
I think it just really warms up the skin
it looks so effortless and like
lightweight on the skin I just I love
the appearance of this I do normally
powder contour afterwards because I do
like to set the cream in place like you
would any other cream on your skin but
this is just going to really help warm
up and bronze and I think I just
she looks a lot more natural than a
powder contour and I'm kind of more that
Instagram bronzy glowy skin as you can
see it's just like blended so
effortlessly into the makeup that we
were already wearing I don't feel like
it looks too much at all I feel like the
colors are really nice natural bronze
and it just looks like I've got a little
bit of a tan even though of Maryland
somewhere along the line hence the Liri
so I don't tan not naturally anyway so
yes these are all the kind of creams for
now that we're going to be wearing on
the skin now we can set everything with
a powder so recently what I've been
loving is setting my under eye with a
pressed powder and then the rest of my
face with a translucent powder the
pressed powder that I've been loving is
the hourglass pressed powder in diffused
light I think it's one of their ambient
lighting powders I have a so many makeup
artist friends that say this is one of
their favorite powders to use underneath
the eye
it just gives such a gorgeous just
radiant glow but also it sets your
makeup in a place and just kind of
doesn't allow things to feel too tight
or too matte under the eye it really
helps to brighten it as well the color
is like I said diffuse like it's a quite
a pale shade but the pigmentation of the
color isn't so so so strong that it's
going to be like super white under your
eyes it's honestly so natural it feels
so comfortable underneath the eye so I
just kind of like to keep it bright
under there and this really allows me to
do so so I essentially just applied this
to everywhere that I applied the
highlight and I want to keep bright and
then I take the Beauty bakery a setting
powder this is they're translucent shade
they do actually do a colored version of
this if you're slightly deeper or maybe
have a slightly pink undertone or like
they do a cater for undertones but this
is obviously just the movie Universal
one that anyone can use cause it's
translucent this honestly just sets
everything in place and makes you look
airbrushed Flores looks amazing in
pictures as well so again perfect for if
you take a lot of Instagram pictures so
basically just gonna be putting this
anywhere that I want to kind of bake and
set and I know personally that maybe I
get like a little bit sweaty or makeup
is prone to come off I use this for that
now before moving on to the rest of the
face products I do like at this point to
go in with a little bit of a fix plus
from Mac one of my favorite products of
all time to use while during skin you
could use it at any step of your skin
routine it just kind of helps to really
refresh your face make sure everything's
kind of look
place and it's really good at getting
rid of that powdery finish in the skin
so just before I move on with the rest
of the skin at products I'm just gonna
give myself a few spritz of this and
this is in the coconut scent they
obviously have two other scents lavender
and rose and they also have the original
one which just naturally it smells
incredible on its own I just thought I
would soo-min and show you the skin at
this stage before we continue with the
face products I feel it's super
comfortable in this it doesn't feel too
heavy that fix+ does really help to kind
of maybe get rid of that powdery finish
and not even though we're wearing a lot
of makeup not let it feel that way so
yeah this is what my skin it looks like
right now so moving on to kind of more
the finishing products I like to call
them so you know our bronzer blush and
highlighter are going to be taking the
Too Faced milk chocolate Soleil bronzer
this is one of my favorite bronzers of
all time it's of a slightly cooler
lighter nature so perfect for kind of
setting what we already had on the face
in terms of the cream contouring and
then just adding a little bit further
depths in the hollows of our cheeks
without the color being too intense or
too orange or anything like that plus
this smells incredible this is obviously
their newer formulated revamped one it
does exist already and smell amazing but
they've got this new packaging out which
I feel is coming very very soon if you
have the old packaging this is still the
same bronzer they've just kind of you
know already bumped it up now a full
blusher
I'm very kind of picky when it comes to
my blush in the sense I don't like
anything too pink I love a warm tone I
love just something that's going to
compliment my skin and I found that this
blusher is kind of one that complements
everyone's skin is the NARS orgasm
blusher which looks like this it is of a
stinker nature but this gold reflect
running through it which i think looks
so gorgeous and glowy on the skin I love
the pigmentation of this it's not too
too pigmented therefore I can really
control the amount I put on my skin it's
almost like a cool toned pink but with
warmth running through it that that's
why I feel like it goes with everyone
and complements everyone's skin tone
because the warmth in it will bring out
my eye color along with green eyes color
but the kind of cooler tone if the pink
would really make brown eyes pop as well
so honestly this is just an amazing
blusher to have and I feel like it's an
iconic one as well and finally obvi
there's so many
highlighters out at the moment but I'm
going to show you a technique that
really makes your highlight pop
specially for Instagram pics you also
you want it to be blinding and you want
to tag that account to say bitch look
what you made me do so what I love to do
is use a liquid highlighter and a loose
powder highlighter and the combination
of them together just is Landon so the
combination I have chosen to use today
is the Maybelline master strobe liquid
in nude I love this one I used it in my
dupes video as well for the Anastasio
Beverly Hills liquid eliminated in peach
fears their honesty is so similar but
obviously this one is a lot more
affordable and possibly a lot more
accessible for a lot of people I just
love the color of this and really blends
effortlessly onto the skin it makes the
perfect base for applying either the
loose highlighters or pressed powder
highlighters on the top I just love it
it's a really Universal color as well
and finally like I said after applying
the cream highlighter I love to go in
with a loose powder highlighter just
because the loose pigments of it really
cling it to the cream and just look so
bright and so so blinding and this is
the artist Couture diamond powder in a
cocoa bling which is actually now
available on beautybay which is so
exciting for us in the UK because this
was really hard to get hold of before I
only actually previously had one of
these products before because I bought
it in America so shout out to you at
Beauty Bay for providing us with the
goods
I love the Anastasio Beverly Hills
highlighting brush to apply it because I
kind of really just like press it onto
the skin you know but you just kind of
like dab it on and its really good for
buffing as well and just getting the
most out of the loose product actually
this is the final step it's not going to
be a Rachel leery of skin tutorial
without a shimmery bronzer and this is
again one of my favorites is the Beauty
bakery loose powder illuminator in the
color so or is it frozen I think it
might be called frozen or so I see I
think it's the kind of frozen actually
it's a really gorgeous of bronze color
and I just love to take a big brush with
this and just go around the perimeters
of my face and it just gives the most
gorgeous glow Andrew
blend the highlighter into our contour
or bronzer and just really it ties the
whole thing check out our and the final
step is to again I'm gonna go back in
with my fix plus you could use a full-on
like setting spray if you wish but I
just love the way that fix+ makes my
makeup look and the way that it makes my
makeup last it's not necessarily a
setting spray but I don't know I just
wonder it doesn't make my makeup last a
lot longer
and it also kind of like fixes my makeup
too so go ahead and douse yourself in
this now bitch right now so this is the
finished Instagram skin looking at
