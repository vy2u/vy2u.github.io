today I thought I would film one of my
most highly requested video is the
makeup on basically like I wear and kind
of tip that I would give on how to make
your makeup last all day so I thought
this is very good confident is to be
done following me on my social medias
and stuff you know I am currently in
Paris with Disney as Disneyland Paris to
their students of the force helper three
carriages
so exciting but that means I'm going to
going on rifle date seeing all the
really cool attractions all day so
essentially all my makeup to last all
day so I thought I would film the makeup
this tie with where in order to make my
name out today this may include a bunch
of matte finishing products I feel like
they last a long distance so yeah I'm
just going to give it my tips and tricks
throughout this video on how I make my
makeup last all day so I'll go finish
doing this makeup I'm going to take you
around Paris with me and show you all of
the cool attractions and rides
especially some of the seasons before to
start with one what are you going to
expect if you get the chance to come to
Paris and see this it's only here for a
limited time so yeah I thought I would
show you a makeup showing you around and
then at the end I will show you how my
makeup last is if you guys look at this
makeup this nature's give this fear a
thumbs up and please keep watching to
ensure your eye makeup loss you want to
prime your eyes 100% and I am in love
with this product this is the Maybelline
Color tattoo in creme de nude it kind of
matches my skin color or is just like a
flesh tone color which i think is really
important if you want to look natural
and like the name suggests it's a tattoo
so literally it doesn't budge but to
ensure that a hundred percent doesn't
budge I always always always set my eye
primer with a powder that way anything I
put on top is going to blend easier and
also lasts a lot longer as well so the
eyes I'm going to take the to Phase two
sweet peach palette which contains a
bunch of natural kind of matte shades I
love using matte shades on my eyes
because I feel like these last longest
as well I'm going to take this shape
here as our initial transition color and
just buff that into the crease with a
Mac two to four like I said I feel like
even on the lid using matte shades are a
perfect way to make them laugh because I
find sometimes on me especially shimmery
shades can transfer and then they just
kind of come wipe away a bit easier so
yeah I'm loving this palette because it
contained loads of wearable matte shades
especially this one as well this is a
really gorgeous warm brown and I'm going
to use that to further deepen up the
crease and also kind of take it halfway
across the lid because we're going to
diffuse that into our lid color and we
want to be able to see a visible
gradient so and which is using a
slightly smaller fluffy brush for this
part and it assists slower this is a max
two and seven you guys know some of
these brushes on my all-time faves and I
always use them and then to further
deepen up the crease taking this matte
brown shade just concentrating this
mainly on the outer third of the eye but
not taking it as far in as that other
kind of we just use it as you can see we
can keep a visible gradient going across
the lid and I think that creates a
really effortless kind of smoky eye
effect and it looks really really
effective but then I am going back in
with the brush that I did use before and
I'm just using that to diffuse it all
together so there's no harsh lines
between the gradient and it will smooth
smooth smooth God flows smoothly and
then I'm going to go in with this matte
white shade I think this is called at
peaches and cream on a flat brush and I
find it packing on product as well helps
it last a lot longer because then you're
really kind of pushing it in it to the
surface so it there's no way that it can
move around and because you put that
primer down as well it does have
something to cling on to but like I said
just pressing that over the empty lid
space and then just using it in it to
that War matte brown color by going back
in with the brush we used to apply it
and just kind of using back and forth
motions sticking with the matte theme
I'm going to take this white peach shade
on a pencil brush and just use that to
highlight my inner corner as our inner
corner highlight I really love this
product because even though it's matte
it really is a bright white so it still
pops just as much as a shimmer then I'm
just going to take a wipe and wipe away
underneath and create that winged effect
because we are going to be doing a
winged liner for winged liner I'm going
to use the NYC liquid liner on me
personally I find liquid eyeliners to
last the longest cuz they it dry matte
and there's not a cream so they don't
transfer as easily or if at all and
that's just a personal preference for me
because sometimes I find like I just
said yes gels can transfer up or they're
easily smudged and stuff and these dry
matte which is perfect I'm then going to
go back in with that brown color that we
used earlier but this time on a pencil
brush so we're concentrating the color a
bit heavier and it appears a bit darker
and just using that in that inner inner
in the outermost part of the eye just to
create a little bit extra depth and that
way
smoky effect then I'm applying the scarf
this is the Maybelline falsies push-up
mascara I find this to have quite a dry
moosie formula which lasts a lot longer
on me personally and it doesn't kind of
flake or come off and now I'm doing my
eyebrows before my foundation again this
is another tip I find to make it last a
lot longer as this product lasts much
better on to dry skin and it's a lot
more pigmented and by the way the lashes
I use are the fluttery lashes and I've
left a link them down below for
moisturizer I'm actually taking mac fix+
and then it buffing it into my skin this
way I find any moist like any foundation
I put on the top isn't going to slip and
slide off because this is quite a dry
product as it's a spray and for primer
I'm using it the anivia post shave balm
just because I find this has a
noticeable tap to it when it dries and
foundation really clings to that said
this is the foundation now like this is
a primer that I found my foundation that
lasts the longest on then I'm going to
go in with concealer this is the Attar
shape tape concealer obviously most
concealers have kind of like a matte
finish so it doesn't really matter which
one you use as long as it's one that
you're comfortable with but I find doing
this onto the skin straight away not on
top of my foundation is a way that it
lasts a lot longer and it avoids
creasing and of applying it too much
product as well so for me this is a way
that I get it to stay bright for longer
as well and using a Beauty Blender to
blend in my foundation and my concealer
helps make my makeup last as it as sort
of any excess and doesn't leave any kind
of like excess product so it won't slip
and slide on the skin and foundation I'm
using the Maybelline matte and poreless
because again is a matte finish and it
lost amazingly then I'm going to go
ahead and set it with powder guys I
always uses powder and if there's a
reason it honestly just makes everything
it's so much longer on the skin and it
gives everything a matte finish and
absorbs any oil and just want to see it
it just makes your makeup look amazing
without applying too much as it is a
translucent loose powder now to finish
off the eyes I'm going back in with that
warm brown shade on a pencil brush and
just a buffing that underneath and then
going in with the mascara again like I
said the formula exists it doesn't
transfer and really separates my lashes
so I find it lost the longest time
so these are the finished eyes and now
we can leave it back on it to the skin
for skin I am then just going to brush
away the bait that we had going on so it
leaves our under eyes a super bright
some longer and also setting it all in
place and 4 bronze I'm going to take the
NYX no filter powder now what's good
about these is if they remind me of some
mac mineralize skinfinish is a mac
mineralize skinfinish is a bake for 24
hours and when they're on the skin they
kind of work with the skin and almost
get better with time it's so that's why
I love this one because then it looks
better throughout the day and then it
just applied a contour I'm using be a
Bahama Mama bronzer from at the balm
again this is just another way to ensure
that your bronzer and contour appears to
last a long time on the skin by just
applying a slightly different product
underneath and but blusher it doesn't
really matter so much maybe just apply
one that's slightly darker or bryson you
usually would if you want it to stay
that color for a long time and that
would be a two-faced too sweet peach
blusher now this is a trick I love for
highlight I love to apply a cream
highlight before powder because like
your skin applying a cream
aka your primer before you put your
foundation on it makes it last a lot
longer so the same concept works with
this applying a cream highlighter before
your powder highlighter gives it a
really good base something to cling to
and it literally glows all day that's
the skin finish and now we can move on
to the lips lining your lips and kind of
feathering the product in it gives the
liquid lipstick you use a base and this
is the pro non-web pencil by Mac in the
shade cultured which by the name you can
tell it's designed to last a longer time
anyway and for liquid lipstick I'm using
it the adjust restore liquid lipstick in
mannequin because it's a really gorgeous
everyday nude and I find the formula of
these to last a long time finally I'm
just setting everything in place with
the oil control makeup setting spray
from Urban Decay to reduce any shine and
lock everything in place and that is my
tips to make your makeup last so this is
the finished makeup look it's kind of
like a matte everyday glam look I feel
anyone can achieve and now let's test it
out
so I just finished doing my makeup and
now it's time to kind of explore the
