sighs you can tell me the title today I
never really do review videos so let me
know how it you find this one when you
get towards the end but today we are
going to be reviewing the brand-new huda
beauty of rose gold remot remastered
palette and I never had the first one so
I can't really do a comparison but by
the looks of it it literally looks
beautiful i've swatched a couple of them
just lightly on my finger but other than
that I have not used it yet so I thought
why not do a kind of first impressions
review see if it's worth the hype before
you buy it or in case you're wondering
whether or not you should buy it before
it goes on sale which is on a may the
22nd but before we get started if you
like the look of this video then please
give it a thumbs up subscribe if you are
new so you can join the family and let
me know when you have done in the
comment section that down below so you
can be in chance for a shout out and
this week's personifications bells
shout-out goes to Fiona
gray who says notification bell always
on it never tried knitting fab makeup
before but I'll be sure to try it now
you look stunning yeah I love it when
you guys try the products that I am
recommending and we can share the love
on them and just thank you so much for
all your support so that further adue if
you want to know if the new rose gold
remastered huda beauty palette is gonna
be worth the hype then stay tuned let's
get started
okay so a little overview of the palette
itself
it contains nine of kind of coiled
shadow shades and nine matte shades all
of a very warmer toned nature but huda
beauty I was doing so she ate her when
it comes to her eye makeup with morph
like the pinky and moveed colors - which
is very much kind of represented in this
palette here so I thought I would go
ahead and do a swatch of them all
straight off the back just to see the
pigmentation and I'm gonna do it on my
arm where I have no product on just to
see how well they really do I'll zoom
you in a little bit more as well so you
can see kind of all the colors this
might be kind of like a better angle
there's definitely a diverse range of
shimmers and mattes all there to be able
to create the perfect smokey eye this
lets you look at the color for
everything so like I said I have no
product on my arm right now so I'm gonna
go ahead and just make my way all the
way across maybe I'll insert a picture
of the palette here so you can see which
house I'm talking about I'm gonna go
ahead and swatch Dubai first so that was
just one finger just wiggling about in
the palette let's go ahead oh they're a
little bit kind of flaky like you could
really press that pigment in if that
makes sense
like when you swatch it straight away
there's a little bit of flake but then
you can almost work that in to create
more pigment I will just show you what I
mean that you can see it does kind of
crumble a little bit there but it's not
like super flaky and not kind of wasting
the product but just to show you what
that looks like after I did that swatch
and that's just kind of like a gorgeous
deep olive color kind of like reflex
with black I love that so again this is
the next color along this is the color
fling oh pretty this is like a gorgeous
like deep rose you can see on my arm
again just a tiny little bit of those
flakes that come off with each swatch
but again I just think that's how you
kind of get the most pigment out of a
product now this next color is called a
trust fund and this looks right up my
street it's like a deep copper color the
next one is rose gold which is kind of
like a goal
with an iridescent pearly purple finish
the next shimmery shade is called pink
diamond whew but for me that's
definitely more of like purple I don't
know you tell me does that look purple
to you this color looks so exciting this
is the 24k color this is like a true
gold then we have a little bit more of a
neutral champagne colored this is called
bubbly then we have a gorgeous kind of
pale gold which is called moon dust and
the final foil color which is called
hashtag blessed and it's definitely more
like a deeper gold bronze kind of color
you can see they all swatch so so
pigmented Li and that was just using my
finger and I feel like with these
formulas you've got warmth in your
finger to really kind of blend and
smooth out the kind of shadow of formula
but you can see for yourselves
they swatch so nicely I will show you
what my palette does look like now you
can see they kind of like break away
slightly I don't know like I expect that
from shadows with high pigmentation I
guess and there's not so much a problem
it just kind of like looks a little bit
messy and I can kind of tell that I
won't be able to pick it up with a brush
let's do an example so silver foiled
shadows I love using my mac 242 brush
which is like one of those ginger
brushes that's really great at packing
on pigments and foiled shadows if I just
use it in the trust fund color let's say
and just kind of rub my brush around
I've literally not picked up any product
and I'll prove it because I'll swatch it
like nothing comes up so I feel like
with these foils it's going to be so
much easier to use your finger for it so
that's just a little tip in terms of
getting the best out of them so now
let's move on to the pigmentation of the
matte shades because that can be really
hard to get pigmentation from so again
we have nine matte shades kind of
ranging from pinks all the way to your
kind of classic smokey eye shades so
let's go ahead and swatch so the first
shade I'm going to swatch is the page
shade called demure which is just kind
of like a pale motion and these are
swatching really nicely and these aren't
so flaky at all especially in the pan I
have a feeling it like the desert dust
palate from UWG if I swell my brush
around in it there's quite a lot of
fallout these have definitely been
reformulate and they're dead and they're
a lot more buttery and creamy which is
amazing so the next shade is a dull face
which is like a really gorgeous bright
pop of pink next up is like a deep
purple called
risk which looks like so and then
finally along the bottom it's your
classic warm tone so this one is
sandalwood henna man-eater suede and
black truffle as you can see again all
super super pigmented sometimes in matte
shades it can be really hard to get a
good pigment from them without getting a
lot of loose shadow come up I'll show
you the palette afterwards and you can
see there's literally next to no fallout
on any of the matte shades so off the
bat off the first swatch I think the
pigment is insane there's not really any
fallout besides on the foiled shades
it's a little bit crumbly but again you
kind of expect that from foiled
eyeshadows I just now know that that's
gonna work best with my finger I hate it
when people kind of bash a palette
without really exploring the best way to
use it if that makes sense just because
it doesn't work with a brush you just
can instantly dismiss it I mean we will
try it with a brush but I just feel like
you're still going to get that insane
pigment that they're showing you and
that that's really true but using your
finger is probably gonna be the best
tool so without further adieu I feel
like a let's do and I look I'm gonna do
one that's obviously at best suited for
me because that's the best way for me to
it try it and also you can see I've kind
of done my makeup I'm going out
afterward so I don't want to do anything
too crazy but I feel like a lot of
people can relate to using this palette
for like an everyday kind of vibe the
colors are very neutral and very warm so
that is the kind of look we're gonna do
today so obviously you're gonna zoom you
in for this and further I prep I've
literally done what I normally do which
is literally next in
nothing just kind of had concealer on my
eyes and I don't tend to set my eyelids
anymore because I feel like I should
have actually clings a lot better to or
something that's a little bit wet so I
never really set my eyes anymore with
powder so that's a little tip so to
begin I'm gonna take my a big fluffy
brush this is from a blank canvas
cosmetics is the e at 20 brush I'm gonna
take the shade sandalwood just thought
I'd quickly show you that's kind of all
the fallout that I'm getting which is a
massive improvement from their desert
does the palette I feel like it's not
going everywhere or anything like that
it's not being wasted like it was and
again you do expect some sort of pigment
and lose shadow to come out if it's
gonna be a super pigmented product but
just picking that up on my brush and
applying it directly in to my crease oh
that definitely applied super like
pigmented Lee maybe I should have tapped
it a little bit more off it's actually
not as warm as I thought it will it kind
of looks kind of it looks like warm on
them in the viewfinder that I'm looking
at but actually on my eye it's quite
like a neutral Brown and that's quite a
great a good color to have in a palette
just just like one of those arrays the
shades and like a blending color you can
see it I just tapped my brush in one
time and the pigment is crazy
I don't find that I'm having to work
super hard to blend out but it does
apply a la with just one dab so I feel
like I'm not going to hit pan on these
any time but certainly definitely do
blend out super easily and my phony just
looked quite heavy because like I said I
don't really apply an eyeshadow base and
that boy probably was just King to a
dump area in my eye but that blends out
really nicely let's move on to the next
shade so I'm just gonna make my way down
the palette I'm gonna take this Jade
here and this is called Hana again I'm
looking at the paddle right now and
getting the same sort of fallout from it
and I made sure to tap off my brush a
lot okay this is a pretty color this is
definitely a little warmer in tone which
is what I hoped for even see I've kind
of used the two lighter lighter shades
of the you know
warm tones and it already to me it's
looking quite dark I feel like they come
off a lot darker then they appear and
pan but they both blend really lovely
together I'm gonna go ahead and use
Hannah again just kind of packing it
packing it on but they are blending
really nicely which is always great
sometimes they can just look really
chalky um yeah but they said really hard
to blend but these are actually kind of
you know sticking to the eyes I'm not
they're not blending out into nothing
the pigment is still there it wasn't
just good on swatch it's actually good
on application as well which is key so
we're gonna pause there and move on to
the lid shade I'm gonna try and apply it
with a brush but again like I said I'm
just gonna show you the difference I
really do think this this palette will
work better with your finger so I'm
gonna go ahead and dip my my mac 242
brush into that trust fund color which
is the bronze II coppery color and just
try and apply it turn what I you can see
I'm like swirling my brush in right now
and yeah I don't know I just don't think
it should be like picking anything huh
and I'm always kind of ruining the pan
by not even trying so I'm gonna go ahead
and like I said pick it up on my finger
and apply you can see you're getting a
lot better color payoff I have got a
little bit of Fallout on my face but
brush and when it's gone so I'm gonna
dip my finger in there again kind of
using the dragging emotions to get the
most out of there and my inner corner
yeah it's like it's kind of I know is a
little bit annoying that you have to use
your finger just because I can't be so
precise maybe if you have that to
conceal it down or something using a
brush would be slightly easier maybe
I'll try I think I tried a different
brush and it just didn't work either
do the same on this side okay that's a
better technique to use just like the
drag ol like work your way in and drag
your way out but that color is like
right on my stre is so pretty especially
if you have a blue eyes I think it
really makes it stand your ikana stand
out I'm gonna try and apply the moondust
color which is that shimmery champagne
and my inner corner on a small pencil
brush this is as a way that Lots petite
pencil to 40 whew see that applied
really nicely with a brush maybe smaller
brushes are better but that color is so
nice as an inner corner highlight but I
thought I'll just look nice as a
highlight shade you know I think that's
really pretty
I'm gonna dip my brush back in it to
that henna shade and just make sure it's
all blended out across my lid and then
just taking a slightly more precise
brush and that cocoa color which is that
dark brown just applying that on the
outer most part of the eye to you know
smoke it out add some depth add some
definition just how I usually would with
a smokey eye I'm glad that even the
darker colors don't have much fallout
because that can always be a little bit
of a worry and a struggle especially if
you're like me and you like to do your
skin and makeup first is it sure next to
no fallout with that so cool we're safe
I'm just gonna go ahead and mix a
sandalwood and hand it together and run
that underneath my eye just to connect
everything together and make your eyes
up I feel that's what I'm gonna do in
terms of the shadow on my eye I love the
colors I think that they really
complement any eye color with this eye
shadow palette it's a shame I felt that
you have to use your finger but there's
ways of working around it and if you
guys have tried this palette will have
similar palettes to this and have tips
on working with foiled shadows like that
then let me know in the comment section
down below but what do you guys think of
the color
I think they literally look so beautiful
I can't wait to maybe play around with
the more colorful colors like the yellow
and the purple and maybe even the Pink's
as well if they're anything like the
ones I have tried I feel like they're
gonna blend like a dream so now I'm just
gonna go ahead and do a mascara and
lashes and then show you the finished
eyes and then I'll give you my final
edits so these are the finished eyes
obviously with the eye shadow and lashes
on safe to say I love lashes just make
such a difference right but safe to say
I love the colors of that eye shadow I'm
really impressed with with the way that
it's come out and laughs and I think it
looks so pretty
so let's go ahead and conclude so that
was the end of the video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it so do I think the
hood of beauty rose gold remastered
eyeshadow palette is worth it if you
bought the initial one I remember seeing
reviews on the first one and the problem
was that they thought that the
eyeshadows were super flaky and just
kind of going everywhere and there was
like a lot of fallout if you loves that
palette but hated that quality about it
then yes I would definitely recommend
picking up this one and replacing it
because the remastered formula of all of
these looks so much nicer there's so
much less fallout I feel like you're
going to be way more happier with this
eyeshadow palette do I have similar
eyeshadow palettes to this that maybe I
can use a brush with and it's not so
hard to work with yes so maybe on that
factor about things I wouldn't
necessarily feel like you need to get
this one but honestly it this is just
such a gorgeous palette in itself I mean
look at it if you love doing halo eyes
and that kind of vibe and all these
foiled shadows are calling to you I
definitely recommend it picking it up in
a few days time it is available from it
may the 22nd I think for us a UK law it
will be available on cult beauty and
Harrods and everything like that you can
join the wait list for them but overall
I love the finished look I think that
they swatch amazingly and it's a super
pigmented eyeshadow palette so hats off
to huda beauty for listening to their
customers and remastering one of the
most iconic eyeshadow palettes that was
all over Instagram at one point and
giving us a bed
