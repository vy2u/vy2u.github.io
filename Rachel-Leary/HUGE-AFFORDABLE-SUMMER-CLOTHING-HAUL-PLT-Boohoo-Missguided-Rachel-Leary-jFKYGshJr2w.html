these tops are really nice you can like
adjust the tightness of how much how you
want to be hey guys welcome back to my
channel so today we're gonna be well one
we're in a slightly a different setup
this is like my lounge I just thought
it'd be a little bit more cheese and
gonna be showing you a bunch of clothes
off see as you can tell by the title and
it's just a little bit more spacious and
free so let me know if you guys actually
like this up give it a thumbs up now if
you prefer this kind of stuff for more
sort of relaxed
chatting videos but as you can tell by
the title I haven't done a clothing haul
in a hot minute so I'm doing a huge
summer clothing haul I see some of that
awesome
jumpers included in here but you guys
always compliment me on my like loose
knit jumpers and you always wanna know
where they are I always get them in like
bright colors so I feel like they are
kind of a summary vibe like sometimes
the evenings they kind of get a little
bit chillier so like just like a
loose-knit jumper and some shorts I
really with that so like there's a
few jumpers in here but love it is
majority like summer clothes or from
like your favor affordable brands and
misguided perennial thing boohoo so I'm
just kind of showing you all the stuff I
picked up recently from there you were
looking for some inspiration for summer
and plastic you guys seem to love my
like fashion II and kind of poster I
feel like you might have the same vibe
with me when it comes to fashion
so so I'm just gonna be like holding up
the clothes to start with but I'll
insert clips of me away so before we get
started it is time for our post
notification of Belle at shout out and
this week it goes to Hanna cond week do
it who says love your videos the look is
goals notification belt is on thank you
honey you guys didn't know I do with
notifications Belle shoutouts on here so
make sure you hit the subscribe button
and the notification bell let me know in
the comment section down below and I
always pick one of you guys at random to
show some love to so yes without further
ado let's get on
so let's start off with what I've got
from freedom thing so the first thing
I've got it's so basic I'm such a basic
bitch is literally it looks like it's
looking pillowcase it's just a basic
white oversized t-shirt I feel like in
the summer I don't really like things
that cling to me too much I mean I have
got a few things that do here but like
on a day-to-day basis if I'm not doing
anything too much just this I kind of
like the vibe of like oversized t-shirts
and those are kind of like cycle shorts
you know I'm saying
so everything's very loose and like I'm
going to stay really cool it only comes
in one size maybe if you're like super
super tiny this would kind of like
swallow you up a little bit but I just
love oversized t-shirts they're so
comfortable and I got it in white just
because nobody wants to be wearing like
a giant black oversized t-shirt in the
Sun I say that wearing a giant but I'm
just like because but you know like
black absorbs heat and like white
reflects it so you should probably stay
a lot cooler if you're wearing this and
obviously I think it's just ghost
anything you could tuck into a skirt
shorts the cycle shorts where it's just
like a giant t-shirt dress and boots of
see like maybe something in Tunisia but
like you know I'm saying so like I feel
like this is like a staple I know
they're so affordable at Sur that is
that one next up it's just like a denim
skirt I literally I really don't like
denim shorts there's only like one pair
of denim shorts that I own which I
actually really like to wear because I
was just kind of chafing it's too tight
or whatever so like I love a good skirt
and I just thought a denim skirt goes
with everything this one has a slightly
longer hem at the back which I kind of
appreciate so that I don't feel like I
have to keep putting my skirt down or
anything like that and it's like a super
stretchy like comfortable material as
well and again this could just go with
anything I could teach you I've got some
one wrap front tops here I've got loads
of those
loving wrap front tops at the moment so
yeah I just thought this is like a steep
hill super affordable I love the like
stretchy comfortable fabric so that was
obviously pain and my bus yeah this is a
little bit more like for going out in
the summer I literally are inside the
picture of me wearing this here it's
like a mesh body super it's got like
gold dots on it and obviously I didn't
wear a bra with this I kind of just wore
nipple covers you know what I'm saying
because I feel like if you wear a black
bra with this you're kind of just like
taking away from like the cool pattern
that's going on what I will say about
this though is that you can't adjust the
strap and the fabric itself isn't like
stretchy so you do kind of have to know
your size with this one because it's
like a zipper bodysuit if that makes
sense so it's really well fitted though
and I think it just goes with like kind
of dresses up I complain black outfit
like you liked me and you were like like
blazes a law or just like plain black
jeans a lot just like this like a
leather jacket or like a loose fitted
blazer because I've seen that and so you
might not want to be wearing a leather
jacket
I just think was really nice and the
gold detailing on it means I can wear
like gold accessories to complement it
so yeah you're feeling a little risque
then check that one out so this was
actually the top that I was wearing in
my oh my god did I keep it on it the
whole time in my most recent video you
guys didn't really get to see it so much
it's kind of booby so maybe I should
have got it in like a size bigger but
it's literally just like one of those
tops it's got like balloon sleeves and
you can tie it around at the front I
just love these tops I think that really
like flat terrain cuz I'd like I'm not
one to like not you know shelf the
cleavage and these tops are really nice
you can like adjust the tightness of how
much how you want to be how much support
you want you know I'm saying so yeah I
would love this and I love orange I
think it might just be because of like
my blue eyes anything orange or like the
Capri that I wear really brings that out
and I do wear a lot of warmth
make up that like compliment stuff like
this though yeah I've been loving at
this top and yeah that was the top that
I was wearing in my previous video if
y'all wanted to know and the final thing
I got from pretty little thing it is
actually a jumper but it's just like a
white cropped jumper I thought this was
so cute just that I was visualizing
wearing it with like sure it's or
something or like more in the evening
maybe with just like jeans because it's
really like I've got this in a lot I
wanted it to be like a really loop I
didn't went to be like a tight corrupt
jumper and I wanted it to be like
slightly oversized so I got it in a
large I just Lee was so cute I love
wearing white in the summer too with a
tan and I just thought yeah this would
be nicer in the evenings it's not to
like think of a fabric to like make me
literally like sweat and die it's a
really nice fabric as well and I really
like a v-neck kind of neckline so I
thought can you just let visualize it
we'd like some new white trainers denim
jean dem shorts that kind of vibe I'm
sure I would have inserted the clip of
me and like hi start up or whatever so
yeah so that is all that I've got from a
pretty little thing so now I'm gonna
move on to what I got from both okay so
the first thing that I got again it's
another like tie up front top this time
it is a white one with a bit more like
balloon sleeve with the fabric of this
isn't law like slinky I don't know how
to describe it you know that like slinky
fabric it's like that and yeah I just
love these tie front tops you can be so
kind of like can adjust it
styler up with like shorts jeans that
kind of thing I think they just spend
casual but also dressy it looks like you
made an effort when really you're just
wearing like a fabric like tied round
but I really just am loving this style
of them at the moment so there's a few
kind of like wrap front styles in hair
it's just a lot more complimentary I
think maybe I don't know I'm learning
how to kind of shop for my shape a bit
more and I feel like these kind of like
suit me yeah love that one sticking with
the kind of like tie front ish theme I
kind of got more of like a loose vintage
shirt I really want to pick up some like
like brah let's that like are acceptable
to be like on show that you kind of make
it more of a fashion statement so I
think that's a vibe for this kind of
summer just like an open shirt just
something quite car's fabric of this is
so like the noose fitted and it feels
like it would be like super Airy so I'm
not going to get too hot and I just yeah
I just thought for like evenings at the
pub just like a nice shirt like a nice
jewelry and stuff that I've left the
links to everything down below but yeah
I just thought like maybe that tucked
into like some denim jeans not as fans
yay I think this might be the same one
is this the same okay that's something a
very it's similar but in this gorgeous
like a bronze copper II tone I just love
this color and I knew that I wear a lot
of makeup that is this color so I
thought this would really like
complement that and bring like out my
makeup whether I wear it and also I
think this kind of really goes with blue
I've got a lot of like blue jeans blue
denim skirt like that kind of thing so I
thought that this would be really nice
to wear with that and it's such like
summary a bronze color and this is the
color I aspire to be literally like I
love how x this is it's so nice the
fabrics really nice in this summer as
well okay next up is something a little
bit more funky I picked up this skirt I
did get that one from misguides it was
bit more pleated but I do like a little
like body corner skirt and to go with it
I got this black cropped jumper because
I thought that might be like a nice by
bike skirt and jumper vibes I don't
actually own like a black knitted jumper
like the queen of knitted jumper I don't
have a black one so I got this which is
just yeah a little cropped black jumper
which I thought would be really nice
like with this skirt and like that
jumper would essentially it go with
anything and this white skirt would even
go with like the white oversized t-shirt
like some one of the white tops down
here I just thought the traffic patterns
really like in at the moment and I'm
loving yellow as well it was good as a
compliments whenever I wear yellow so I
mean there's a few other yellow items in
here too so yeah I thought like that's
like a cool vibe just reflect some ankle
boots like a little side band nothing
you guys getting that vibe let me
or is that too like schoolgirl whatever
you guys let me know in the comments
down below what you think about that's
finally something a little more exciting
that's just like do this up for a set
final thing I got from boohoo is this a
leopard print play suit I kind of felt
like this is more like holiday vibes so
I probably wouldn't wear this like
actually maybe I don't know I don't
really find leopard print that like like
you know intimidating now I know a lot
of people think that rule 11 print but I
thought this was quite like a toned down
leopard print and these kind of places
this style of them is like my fave I
love the loose fitted short and like
especially in this like chiffon fabric
then as you can see this one actually
like ties up at the front so it's that
tie front top style that I really like I
just think it's really complementary and
I can't really I can't wait to wear this
on holiday like imagine interested like
a bold lip maybe like red or something
it and then just like some black
gladiator sandals that kind of thing I
just think that would look so nice at
the time it's just like a little bit of
fun for holiday like I love that would
print I think it just shows you're a bit
more fun and adventurous you not to you
know worried about what people are
thinking or they might be think you
might go no Sheen it yeah I really like
that I love the fabric I love the fit of
it so thank you love it and finally the
cutting of stuff is from at misguiding
how some of this stuff might be under
this like a jack in here but like the
jacket for me it's like it is summer
vibes like I still wear jackets in
summer guys so like don't always pull
them out but there's a lot more color in
this which I am so excited for so the
first thing that I picked out was this
like lime neon yellow it's actually a
jumper dress but I feel like I'll
probably just wear it as like an
oversized jumper I made sure to get it
like fairly oversized
again like I said I don't buy it super
tight jumpers in like the summer is a
funky bright color which I'm really
vibing with at the moment yeah I just
thought this was really cool something a
little bit different I don't own
anything like this bright and like this
yellow I thought this would just look
good tucked in just and sure I thought I
could wear like a bright pink lipstick
with this or is that like too much I
don't know Summer 2018 is going to be
extra as look so we want bright colors
so I feel like this is the style of
jumper that like you guys are always
asking me about this is literally the
jumper but I think pretty little thing
do one like literally exactly the same
so I can never remember if it's like
from pretty little thing or it's from
misguided anyway this is just like
another one of those like knitted
jumpers and I just got it in yellow this
time I didn't have a yellow like you
said I love yellow I think of its really
nice to ten this one might actually be
nice the bright pink lipstick I feel
like I'm not sure basic just knit jumper
rabbit some shorts like a belt that kind
of vibe I just think that they're just
they come they go with everything
they're so handy just like a pair of
leggings shorts jeans whatever pop on a
loose-knit jump and they just kind of
like slouchy and cooler like I like to
look but glam and like that's my
vibe was just like slouchy mclamb and I
feel like bright colors just make it
look more fun in the Sun so the next two
things I kind of got to wear together
this again is kind of more holiday vibe
so we'll see how this slightly looked
but it's basically just like a really
really obviously like loose net
jumper type thing obviously it's me I
think it's meant it wasn't advertised
it's like a beach cover-up because the
girl in the picture is just wearing it
in the way that I was gonna plan to wear
it it's just kind of like a loose-knit
jumper bear does have enough coverage to
be able to just look like wear it out it
does have like a low back but I did just
get this like black brawler to win there
I'm like we'll see how it looks but I
feel like this black brawler as well
goes with like the loosen it jumpers or
like the shirts from boohoo it's got
like a little leopard print like the
vibe going on but I just felt like this
with like this over the top it's like
underwear as outerwear kind of risque
but it's still covered and you just kind
of look quite stylish but again or you
could just like wear this as like a
beach cover-up I just thought it was
kind of cool nice and airy see not
sweating you ball
yeah I just thought that this was like
something a little bit different I don't
know I'm all about like trying different
things and also I find this a black
Rolla it's gonna come in handy because I
 hate wearing bras in the summer
like big city girls can you like those
with middle it's like I hate wearing a
bra any situation where I could just
like rather not wear one I'm not gonna
wear one I think this is nice it still
looks so cool but it's like started at
the same time so I just thought I'd pick
up a little black black brawler and on
to the final item I like was so excited
for this so excited for this this is the
it's the fanny Lippmann and misguided
collab I love a bomber jacket if you
know me I used to have bomber jackets in
like every color like no joke I
do bomber jackets at any outfit but this
one was just really cool it's like super
oversized it's white and it's got hurt
now I think jackets in the summer are
fine but like I think white ones are a
little bit more acceptable just because
it's more like a lighter color light
weight and especially this is like so
lightweight I just love the look at this
I feel like it looks really like cool I
don't know and I feel that you can get
away with it because it's so lightweight
something it's not weighing you down
it's not adding any extra like heat it
just kind of like makes an outfit that
really like you know exam him she got
styled on set so yeah I've got this what
just like that what sighs I get it I
don't listen as 12 because it said
oversize ba Manasa is it I didn't know
what the fabric was like like so yeah
this is what I think it looks really
cool I might put my like slightly tube
but no I really like this and I thought
I didn't know it summer and I'm going to
keep saying they still wear jackets and
like this was just like a really cool
one you know because you live in England
sometimes it's like boiling hot Sun and
then suddenly it's thunder and
lightning and it's like I can leave
my hood up so I thought this would be
like really cool this is the slightly
more expensive item I think it's just
like 65 pounds I did use my sister's new
day
discount thinking so I didn't say little
Bitcoin but yeah what do you guys think
I really like it so loving that bond
loving that connection to that was like
a really cool collection so that was the
end of my affordable some operating hall
there was so much hair oh my god if
there's anything that you liked I've
left a link down below if you want to
like have a scroll whatever no
implications just making it easier for
