I've been tweeting and letting you guys
know that I kind of been wanting to get
back into doing clothing hauls and stuff
like that and recently I realized I kind
of accumulated a a bunch of new clothes
from a bunch of brands that are kind of
really big on Instagram and social media
at the moment so I thought I would go
ahead and show you what I got
ok so I've kind of got everything out in
front of me and there's no particular
like theme to this haul it's just kind
of like collective tote so you guys can
get a hint for my style and the stuff
that I'm into and what I'm kind of going
to be wearing around this time of year
one of the first brands I got some stuff
from is from Miss PAP I'm sure you guys
have heard of it and they do a really
good kind of affordable clothing it's
quite generic in the sense that it's a
lot of the same stuff that you see
everywhere but I think that the quality
of it is amazing and some of the stuff
that I picked is like super comfortable
as well the first thing I got with this
pair of boots now believe it or not I've
actually quite a few pair of shoes but I
don't own just a simple plain black pair
of kind of what are they called they're
kind of like that sock boot type thing
and I saw these on the website and I
thought well that's perfect cuz they're
affordable as well they are feel really
good quality I've not worn the exit only
got them at recently but yeah I just
think a Blair a pair of black boots just
goes with everything and definitely
around this time of year I'm definitely
definitely I'm a hundred percent going
to be wearing up more boots so the next
thing I got was this suede skirt it's
like a miniskirt it's I love this kind
of material it's the suede material bits
the super kind of comfortable one and
it's kind of stretchy as well this is in
a size medium and I love the idea of
kind of wearing skirts in the full time
with like a long trench coat or
something or just like a big long
waterfall coat I feel like what in
England the weather is kind of like is
it cold is it not sometimes it's really
sunny so that makes you really warm but
the wind is really cold it's kind of
that happy medium so that is why I got
this and I love nude camel colors as
well so excited to try this sorry it's
not a try on haul by the way it's that
time of the month and you know and you
just don't want to be trying things on
and stuff so please forgive and then the
other thing I got from Miss PAP was
literally just a pair of leggings and
is have a hole in the knee and their
navy blue and I've been really into
Native you at the moment I got a few
bits ages ago like I got a big navy blue
a fluffy coat and I didn't have anything
really navy blue to wear with it or
anything like that so I saw these online
and I so much prefer like jeggings
compared to like actual jeans I think
these just a bit more forgiving a bit
more comfortable as well so I saw these
online and I love the hole in the knee
type thing so I think those up too okay
so the next place I picked some bits up
was from misguided they had a Black
Friday sale and then they had actually I
think I missed at the Black Friday I
forgot about it and I did the whole when
it was 30 percent of everything else I
oh my god that's amazing like I'll do my
shopping then but I girl I got a another
skirt and this one has that kind of
embroidered pattern on the front it's
kind of like a silky material and it
zips up at the front - I don't know oh
that actually doesn't zip okay I really
loved the colors on this I could really
see myself wearing something really
plain like a white bodysuit or like
sewing like that and then kind of
incorporating a lip rolling around the
embroidery on this the whole embroidery
trend is really big at the moment kind
of I think is inspired by like Gucci or
something but yeah I thought that was
really pretty and the colors are colors
that I love and really have a lot of
stuff that would go with them and I feel
like that's kind of a nice little
statement piece if you want to wear like
plain everywhere else another thing that
I picked up was this pearl a suit so it
is long-sleeved it is very plunging and
then it like frills or at the bottom and
I'm obsessed with this material I will
say though I recommend buying a size up
then you actually are if you have like
big boobs just because it's really like
small hair but then you've got to get
that over your chest it's really
complicated and I me and my friend are
having a massive kerfuffle with this the
other day but yeah I really loved the
Freddy material I probably wear a belt
ran the middle of it as well and I love
anything that kind of like plunges with
Effie and I think this is kind of like
nice around this time of year to kind of
wear out I mean you can wear it with a
jacket but play suits like anything like
long sleeves and short hair
I think is a nice compromise and being
like short-short and just like actually
at freezing your tits off while you're
out but yeah I saw this and I was in
love with it and yeah I really love this
material something a bit different for
me and I wanted to try it so when you
dance you can like when you don't move
your bum these are like move with you
and everyone black also a from misguided
I got this is literally just a plain
nude like a jumper dress I got another
one as well from a pretty little thing
I'll show you that in a second but yeah
I just thought jumper dresses trench
coats and like boots around this time of
year perfect because then they're not
too hot not too cold
super comfortable hides everything like
they're just I think they're the best
invention and I'm glad they're kind of
like in style as well because then
everyone can be comfortable but yet this
one is in the color like nude or camel
oversized jumper dress love it I'll link
everything it down below by the way so
you can see what they look like on the
model since I'm not trying them on and
you can get a feel for like prices and
whatever and then the final thing I got
from misguided was this trench coat so
it is in that movi color it really long
as well and I have a camel one from ASOS
that I wear all the time and I love the
kind of style of them so I wanted to get
it in a different color and I'm going to
wear it today with my outfit as you can
see the kind of movi colors go oh the
movie colors kind of go together and
yeah I'm obsessed with this color
especially with like my lighter hair and
having like two eyes I think just makes
everything look and make everything kind
of like pop and I think this color would
look really flattering on everyone and
to be fair for a coat how much was it I
can't see why I actually don't think it
was that much and they always have
discounts like student discounts and
stuff so it's such an amazing material
as well really worth the money and I
can't wait to start wearing this in the
winter and quarter months so that was
all from misguided and I'm going to
really quickly just show you the one
thing that I got from pretty little
thing and it's basically the same as the
thing from misguided but in green so
it's like a car key jumper dress again I
thought this would look nice with a
trench coat or just like so Inc really a
cash
and I've been really loving green at the
moment and this was a slightly lighter
green which is what drew me to it
because dark khaki green I don't think
really complements my skin tone or like
my kind of coloring and this light green
really caught my attention so yeah
that's what I got from a pretty little
thing okay so the next brand that I got
things from is a Instagram a like a big
brand on Instagram called mesh key so
you may not recognize the name right off
the bat but I'm going to insert a
picture here that dress that she is
wearing is from that brand and I don't
have that kind of put on the market or
anything but they are an Australian a
boutique and they have some of the
nicest clothes I've ever seen speaking
of that picture I did go ahead and get
that dress as well so it is like a white
satin slip kind of dress crosses over at
the front I have tried it on and I'm
obsessed with the way that it kind of
sits on your body it's super super
flattering and they do it in other
colors as well and the material of it is
just really it's really amazing and
super comfortable and everything's
really nicely kind of made so I love a
good kind of like a silky dress like
this I'd wear it with like thigh highs
or just like a simple pair of shoes I'm
sure I'm probably a plan to post a
picture on Instagram wearing this so you
will have seen how I would have styled
her another thing I got from that site
was just a plain cami dress like this
this is in the color stone I think it's
not white it's not it's more like a
champagne gold kind of color and I just
love like I said I love these kind of
slip dresses I think they're super
flattering I would wear this one
probably with thigh high boots and like
a nice jacket or like a trench coat
which I'm going to show you here and
yeah the quality of it feels amazing and
it can't wait to wear it another thing I
got with these pair of leggings they're
not super super stretchy they are around
the waist but not necessarily when that
on your leg and they have a zip up at
the back rather than the front and I
just thought like a nice pair of like
faux leather looking leggings and
wouldn't go mess around this time of
year I think like I said they kind of
like just paint back and they go with
everything but add a bit more sort of
like class maybe to look or make
something look or your outfit look a bit
more kind of like put together rather
just wearing
a pair of leggings and yeah I kind of
liked the fact that they dipped up at
the back because then they kind of give
you a bit more of a butt so I really
like these ones and finally from them I
got a kind of a trench coat type thing
but this is a lot more of a lightweight
material so a lot more kind of a lot
more kind of comfortable it's not
necessarily going to make you so like
warm if you're wearing out and it's in
the color tan I love these kind of
jackets for like events and stuff where
it could be like really hot inside B you
might want to stay covered and a bit
more put together I think they're
perfect for either going out for dinner
or summer where you're going to be in an
environment where it's quite warm but
you want to still be wearing like a long
jacket or something they're super super
lightweight as well the quality of this
feels amazing I definitely need to give
it an iron before I wear it but I'm sure
you will see me wearing these pieces
soon I actually have a discount code for
you guys it is Rachel 15 and that
entitles you to fifty fifteen percent
off site-wide and if you've never heard
of that brand before I definitely
recommend checking them out they have
some seriously its stylish items on
there and such amazing quality so yeah
I'll leave everything linked below then
I got a couple of bits from Abu who have
just fallen then I got a couple of bits
from Abu who this is this is one of
their kind of like faux suede what they
called it it's like a faux suede a biker
jacket I think this is in the color
mocha so you can tell I'm kind of really
into the nudes and the kind of tan
colors and I really love I think I have
this one already in more of a kind of a
caramel tan color and then I saw that
they had this one and I'm obsessive this
kind of color I think having a kind of
colored jacket if you specially a song
that likes red or black or something I
just think as a statement piece to your
look makes you look like you've put a
lot more effort in than you might
actually already have so yeah I picked
this up their jackets are such amazing
clothing they've got such an amazing
range in at the moment
definitely miranne recommend checking
them out and again they always have
discounts with like students and at the
moment I think with all like the Black
Friday stuff they might still have
something on but yeah this is their like
suede biker jacket and then finally from
boohoo I got a pair of shoes these are
kind of like rose gold gladiator wrap
around shoes I thought these would be
I think like the party season coming up
we'd like New Year's Christmas or just
like any sort of like events I didn't
actually own any shoes in this color but
I have a lot of makeup that's in this
color so I kind of put two in two
together and thought oh if I'm wearing
like rose gold on my eyes but want to
wear like a black dress or something
kind of want something to tie in shoes
and then finally it is from a Instagram
brand called a blue LaFave I've recently
posted a picture on my Instagram wearing
a couple of bits from them which I'll
show you in a second one bit that you
probably have that you wouldn't have
seen is this one this is a is a baby
blue kind of color it cops you kind of
like just under your boob bit lower I
guess I love baby blue on myself
personally I think it really brings out
the color in my eyes and complements my
hair
they had other colors as well I think
and they've got so much cool like
Instagram you type clothes I know are
kind of in trend at the moment so
definitely worth checking them out yeah
the quality of them is so good I mean
sometimes with oversized sweaters they
can be really thick and then you just
kind of look like oversized but these
are a really kind of like thin ish
material but then lined really nicely so
they're going to keep you warm but still
they're thin and lightweight material so
they're super comfortable so that is
they're kind of blue a cropped sweater
then as you would have seen before I got
these kind of clear rimmed glasses I did
have some before and they're from ASOS
and I've always worn them but these ones
the shape are just a lot more I don't
know I would prefer to wear these over
the other ones I've already got and I
know that these ones are in trend at the
moment these are the perfect butters
when you really can't be asked to make
an effort with your makeup and you just
want something super minimal but maybe
like nothing on your eyes you really
can't be bothered pop these on normal no
love them and I'll leave them link below
and then finally it's just this plain
white oversized sweater as well again is
made of the same material so it is thin
but it's really nicely lined with like
like wool but like almost like feels
like felt but like a lot softer so it's
super warm but super lightweight and the
quality of them is amazing and yeah you
can't go wrong with plain oversized
sweaters they're like my favorite thing
if you haven't already been able to tell
from the few that I've got in this video
yeah these are all from a blue lefur and
I will leave them linked
though so that is the end of my clothing
war I really hope you guys enjoyed this
