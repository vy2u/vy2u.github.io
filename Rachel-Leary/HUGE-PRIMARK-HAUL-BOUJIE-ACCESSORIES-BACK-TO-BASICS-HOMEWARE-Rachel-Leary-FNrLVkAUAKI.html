today I can't believe I've never done
one of these before I'm gonna be doing a
big fat hole Primark haul I recently
picked up a ton of stuff from Primark
some ranging from like home wares those
of accessories some kind of like a
basics but I flipped their necessities
and a few items I just kind of got more
than one color in because who doesn't
love a basic and I feel like Primark is
the queen of shops when it comes to
you're just getting all your basics and
necessities and in all different colors
and it doesn't break the bank so it's a
win-win I'm actually going to see a
Beyonce and jay-z on a Friday with
Primark which is kind of why I've got a
bunch of stuff to be able to wear to the
concert with them and so so so excited
any of you guys are going I think it's
enough obviously the London is showing
you don't see jay-z at Friday if you are
going I'll see you there pet but before
we get started on this bit for haul I'm
gonna give my presentation at Belle a
shout out to Ruby Turner who says
notifications are not loving at this
look
Thank You Ruby I am loving you at muchly
yes I feel like without further ado
let's doll I never know is it doll JH
doll let's doll into this bag of goodies
before ever it's because I wish you just
ripped the sides
so this isn't gonna be a at trial and
all just because majority of this stuff
I thought you don't even like really
need to see it on they're all quite
basics all kind of likes the same stuff
Brooke different colors and then there's
just home wear accessories all that kind
of stuff so let's start off with the
basic stuff orthey I just picked up a
pair of ankles like a packet of ankle
socks I know that sounds so boring in a
bit you're thinking what an anticlimax
the beginning of that haul but I lose
socks like no tomorrow I feel like my
friends come and am I just the only one
that just really doesn't want to lend
anyone a pair of socks because they're
literally like gold dust so I just got a
pair of black ankle socks like red they
go with everything
super cheap as well I feel like they
were like one pound some things so
lovely also some other basics but like
girls these have to be hands down some
of the comfiest and nicest pants ever
the thongs from Primark but like you
know like the thick lace ones I got them
in white and I got them in black but I
always get like the multicolored packs
but then I realized I didn't have just
kind of like the basics colors these
pants are literally my favorite they are
so comfortable they sit really like
nicely unlike your stomach as well and
they're not too tight I always tend to
get like a slightly bigger size in these
ones but yeah I got them in white and
black because they are literally the
best pants ever you feel me I also got a
pair of kind of like black basic strappy
in the heels I feel like I scuff and go
through especially these kind of heels
so much just because they go with
everything it's just the perfect simple
kind of like sandal and these are just
in a nicer faux suede a simple black I
quite like that they come high up
towards the back I feel like just a
staple shoe that goes with any outfit
these were only like antenna I think and
they feel like really comfortable the
bottom of them as well they have that
slightly thicker platform
super spongy so I feel like I'll be able
to last in these
and who would have known that these are
Primark not me but now is it okay so
this is kind of where the repetitiveness
happens I bought three at the same top
but all in different colors because I'm
a girl and that's just what we do plus
with the summer coming up I feel like
the basic kind of colored camis go with
everything pair of jeans a pair of
patent shorts something like that and I
thought these colors were super pastel
and they reminded me of like ice cream
so I got this one and this is just in
like a a mint blue color as you can see
I love the fat there's v-neck and I love
the fact that it has adjustable like
sleeves so you can tighten them or
loosen them as well so again I got the
same top but in this gorgeous baby pink
I'm such a sucker for baby pink
especially when I'm just super turned
with brown hair I just feel like it's a
bit flirty it kind of because it's kind
of not like a bright color
I've never get catches people's
attention and it has like quite an
innocent vibe about it but really you're
out but a pastel don't keep though and
finally I got the same top but this time
it is in a white I feel like why it's
just such a staple especially when
you're tad and on the holiday it
literally obviously goes with everything
so I thought if I'm getting those two
colors and may as well just pick up a
white one I love wearing a like bold lip
with white as well that's so I'll short
we do that wait I'll show to be do only
the warm I'm saying I'll be sure to do
that got there in the end
next up for all trousers so I got two of
the same pair of jeans literally I if I
could show you the pair of black jeans
I've been wearing they've literally been
like worn away probably because I got
six size and a chaise and it's just worn
away at the fabric so I literally got
the same they basically feel like the
same pair but I love these ones because
they are their what they could super
high waist skinny jean and they're super
stretchy as well which I love in a jean
because when you're going out and maybe
like you eat something and your stomach
needs to stretch as well so this kind of
like stretches up with the Jean so I
look she's got a pair of black jeans
I've never tried Primark jeans before
so hoping these would be good I got them
in like a 12 12 10 12 12 12 I think just
because I wasn't sure when I know my
marks kind of notorious for coming out
of this small I thought these are
stretchy and I'm kind of done with that
size anyway so just a reference I got
then in a 12 and then I got the set oh
well I did I was gonna say I've got the
same pair in white this sticker says 12
and I've just looked there and it says
1/8 this isn't even gonna fit over one
of me legs so right I'll be retiring
that and exchanging it but but basically
I've got the same pair of jeans in a
white the superhighways to stretch
skinny by the way for reference these
were 9 pounds each I just I've like gone
through so many pairs of white jeans and
just one ruins them all and I was going
to my wardrobe the other day I was just
looking at them thinking Rachel you need
a new pair of white jeans I love white
jeans I think it makes you bomber look
big and yeah I feel like they were kind
of more acceptable in the summer cuz
they're like a light colored Jean and
reflect the Sun you're not getting it
too hot if you don't want to get your
legs out so yeah I got them but I'll be
taking them back and getting me bigger
size thank you and the final pair of
trousers I got these kind of an orange
chiffon II culottes I got these to wear
to the Beyonce gig on Friday I think
with that white top and then a few of
the accessories that I've got in here I
love this color I love orange I feel
like I want to tie my makeup in with it
Primark I've just come out of there new
summer collection it's very tropical
very this kind of tone so I thought this
would tie in nicely by whether makeup on
the day and they're just very
lightweight I feel like they're gonna be
super super comfortable and I feel like
they'll be perfect for my holidays as
well just to maybe work with like a
white top or like bodysuit black
bodysuit that kind of thing it just adds
a pretty nice pop of color you can maybe
even tie in your lipstick with it but
that's gonna be the clothes I told you
was a little bit boring in the sensor I
got loads of things
kind of repeats them and they're all
basics that I know that us girls will
need and I didn't want to do anything
too adventurous because they thought I
just want to kind of do like a relatable
haul that like everyone is gonna
probably like like this stuff or like
the other colors or whatever their
basics that we all need but then I'm
moving into accessories this is kind of
where I hit the jackpot so I've got this
belt let me take the plastic off and
what I love about this is that it looks
like a Gucci belt world from a
distance Gucci or Prada Gucci I'm up but
I've always wanted to get my hands on
the thicker Gucci belt but I thought for
the time being why don't just get the
one from Primark that looks just as nice
it's a complete fraction of the price is
four pounds and still like it's gonna do
the trick I love the fact that just kind
of like pops in like the actual Gucci
belt does I thought maybe I'll wear that
with the orange trousers they have a
good thicker waistband
I just thought yeah this I've seen like
so many people wear this and I couldn't
believe when they told me that it was
from Primark I definitely wanted to pick
it up while I was there and yeah
I just love belts I love black belts tan
belts all sorts of belts I just feel
like they really can make an outfit and
really just kind of tie it all together
and looks really sophisticated so I made
sure to pick up that one definitely I
recommend that you guys do too if you're
in the market for a belt that looks
high-end but isn't so much this is the
one I also picked up a couple of pair of
Hoops some are fairly basic these are
just a pack two pack of gold hoops I'm
pretty sure I might have actually bought
these before but I think I flunked them
often and I cut oh I just got home after
a nightclub and like bed for an hour and
I was just like thanks for telling
everyone so I made sure to stock up on
some simple gold hoops one slightly more
like a twisted pattern and the others
literally it just a simple gold
medium in my size hoop I would say you
can see I'm a hot against their medium s
size hoop I would say but take a look at
these these are what you would have seen
in my Instagram picture that I posted
going live because I literally want to
put them on right this set
and oh my god they're like really big
but they're just covered in diamonds but
not too thick either my inner thought
was just like yes and I definitely sat
there for like hours just making sure
that they all had their rhinestones in
it but I am so excited to wear these I
think they're so extra
especially when you have like if you
went up dues a lot just kind of like a
big statement hoop sometimes I think
looks really nice and these aren't too
blingy and too out there or they're not
for me anyway but yeah I just saw them
they were only 2 pounds 50 and I just
thought thank you very much and the last
few items are actually just kind of home
very bit so I picked up two candles I
can't believe they're candles or 80
pence whatever but this one is called
Madagascan vanilla which as you can
imagine is that classic kind of like
vanilla linen type smell oh my god it
really reminds me of my Granny's house
and then this one is there oh did you
take it off pretty sure it is called
them button mango and passion 3 one but
yeah literally it smells like a smoothie
I can't wait to burn this not sure like
which pop the house to burn them and I
feel like vanilla isn't my bedroom and
mango is kind of more just like as you
come in you want to smell the fruity
patooty
and I also picked up some luxury face
cloths in the peach color darling I got
these because I've actually run out of
flannels and then that sounds really
weird but like they were all my flowers
are like white and for someone that kind
of wipes off face masks a lot that tends
to be like black or different color or
just wiping off my bone cleanser on my
face
I literally just go through files and
just ruin the color so I thought what
colors my skin Orange
so I made sure to pick them up in like a
peachy color
so hopefully the stains wouldn't be so
bad and I'd be able to wash them and use
them again and these were only 250 for 3
so I thought that was a bargain and the
last two things I got are a luxury
fitted double sheet and a luxury at
duvet cover
in double as well which came with two
pillowcases this was just in white and
this wasn't grade because that's kind of
the color theme of my bedroom when I
make my bed I will insert a picture here
of what my bedroom looks like with those
sheets on and I think it looks pretty
bougie if I do say so myself
yeah it was about time I got some new at
sheets and show my mum would agree says
there I think it's a 200 thread count
100% cotton percale per sale no idea but
it's part of their luxury range so I
just thought that they can't be that bad
and Primark do the most amazing home
stuff like so fun so creative and that's
why I picked up the white and the gray
because I'm boring but now I just got
these it to go to my room the duvet
cover was 20 pounds and the sheet was
she ripped off the price tag I feel like
he might have only been like a tenner
something like that so super affordable
bed linen and I feel like there'll be it
super comfortable but I plan to fake
turn tonight
so probably buying a white Steve a cover
was not the wisest idea oh well but that
was the end of the hall I really hope
you guys enjoyed it a little bit more
laid-back and chill destroy the items
weren't super super exciting but I think
we can all relate to them and might
inspire you to go check out your local
