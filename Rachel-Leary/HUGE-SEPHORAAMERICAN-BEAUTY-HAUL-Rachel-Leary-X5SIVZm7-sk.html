today is the long-awaited Sephora I'm
kind of a chimeric and beauty haul that
I did from my New York Fashion Week trip
obviously I wanted to pick up some
American makeup but you can't get here
some of the brands and that I have
shopped you can get here but there was
color ranges and specific products I
didn't you can get so super excited to
shoot or what I got and maybe give me
some inspiration or like if you wanted
to try things let me know in the
comments down below so like if there's
anything that I show you a new on a
review or a demo or just a tutorial
using definitely comment below and then
if other people agree I want you guys to
like that comment so I can see and I'll
know which products to film with so I've
got a mix of like skincare and makeup
and some haircare products as well so
I'm gonna jump straight into it and
we're gonna start with Sephora so I
definitely think you can get this in the
UK but only from like specific places
and I feel like I'm a bit late with this
one I picked up the tops in the bloom 2
palette I was with Amy and she told me I
had to get this so I definitely wanted
to pick my hands up with it what I
definitely wanted to get my hands on it
you're really into like movi tones this
is the perfect palette for you there's a
mix of matte and shimmery shades in here
and as you guys probably already know if
you've seen it before I thought this
palette was perfect for this time of
year it's got really nice kind of all
terminal colors and I do really like
blush tones and motely turns for this
time of year I think that's super super
flattering on the eye and yeah I really
like these kind of colors so let me know
if you want to see a kind of full makeup
look using this palette so I know quite
a few people have it and I need just
managed to pick it up so a bit late with
it so yeah let me know in the comments
down below also from Sephora I picked up
a few bits from hourglass so 2 of them a
travel size I picked up the minion
little version of the hourglass ambient
lighting bronzer this one is in the
shade luminous bronze light so it looks
like this you have to excuse my nails it
looks like this it's a really a gorgeous
light bronze cover like the name
suggests and it has a kind of satin
finish on this
so it literally does give a luminous
dewy finish on the skin
we'll definitely recommend this for kind
of more medium to tan people because
even though it looks kind of like it
does pay off quite dark on the skin so I
would definitely recommend this if you
have more of a medium skin tone it would
be quite heavy if you're more of the
fair side but I don't know if it would
show up the way it would on maybe a
darker skin tone so definitely more
medium skin tones I don't know if you
can see again the swatch looks really
really light but it does translate on
the skin quite dark yes if you like a
bronzer with a bit of a shimmer to it
bit of an luminous glow I'd definitely
recommend this one I wasn't sure how I
was gonna feel about it so that is why I
picked up the trouble size but I do
really really like it so when I run out
of this I'm definitely gonna pick up the
full size version another travel size
product I picked up was the hourglass
primer when I was there um I loved
Sahari or Karen however you know her she
was telling us that she mixes this with
her Kevyn Aucoin skin enhancer you know
the concealer and it makes the most
amazing foundation but lasts all day
amazing coverage so I I picked this up
because I wanted to try it out before I
bought the full size version again cuz I
wasn't sure if it was gonna go good with
my skin but I really really liked this
primer and I'm excited to try that
combination that she suggested because
I'm always on the hunt for like a really
flawless finish in foundation and her
skin is always phenomenal yeah this is a
pretty good primer I've used a couple of
times already and I really like mixing
it with another one of the products I've
got so I'll show you that in a second
but yeah you're looking for a really
nice primer not to do it on the skin not
to matte on the skin just kind of more
of a really like it's quite hard to
describe it's called a mineral veil
primer but it said like it does feel
kind of wet on the skin which is like a
primer that I really like it's not too
velvety or too like silicone II so it
just feels super super comfortable on
the skin quite similar to the Too Faced
hangover effects in like feel and then
finally from hourglass I picked up the
stick foundation I picked up in the
shade golden tan now this is a bit of an
expensive foundation and I only picked
up because I was in America so it was
slightly cheaper and I know some people
are a bit on edge about it I'm gonna
swatch up really the color in the
coverage so that's the color that I got
like I said
in golden tan also like I said it is a
bit expensive but oh my god this is like
such a gorgeous finish on the skin you
barely need any of it which i think is
why you get quite a little amount within
this product but yeah so you only need a
tiny amount a little goes a long way and
it gives the most gorgeous satin full
coverage finish I also have one of the
Anastasia Beverly Hills stick
foundations so you maybe won't let the
comparison video or that even with the
makeup forever stick foundation let me
know in the comments below because I
know it is quite an expensive foundation
so you definitely want to know if it's
worth it before you buy it another face
product that I picked up is the Kat Von
D locket tattoo concealer you could only
get this in America as in Kat Von D now
it's coming to debenhams in the UK so
I'll see you K girls can get our hands
on it - a lot more easily yeah I picked
this up while I was in Sephora a lot of
tea and light light shades were really
really light and really pink an
undertone this was kind of the first
yellow shade that I picked up and I got
mine in the shade medium 27 warm so I'll
swatch that for you know so that is the
concealer swatch there as you can see
that would be like my foundation color
and then that is the concealer so it is
still gonna lighten up underneath my
eyes but not too drastically but just
like her concealer this is super super
full coverage amy said that she found
that this kind of creased on her a
little bit didn't so much crease on me I
don't know if we just applied it in
different ways but definitely recommend
blending this out with a damp Beauty
Blender to absorb any excess to avoid
creasing so it's not to have heavy
underneath the eyes and it definitely a
little it goes a long way with this you
know me I can't really go to a shop
without buying some sort of nude gloss
so I picked this one out from buxom I
have one from buxom already and it's the
white Russian line but this one is in
the shade Samantha as you can see it's
got it's like a pink undertone and it
has like gold glitters running through
it which is like my dream in a gloss I'm
obsessed with glosses like this and I
probably have way way too many awesome
really similar but you can't get buxom
in the UK so I definitely wanted to try
it the whole of the buxom range is like
lip plumping as well and you guys know
I'm about making my lips
bigger so I definitely wanted to pick
this up and I love a nude gloss I know
new glosses will forever be a thing so
if you're looking for a new one to try
definitely try this one then I picked up
the cover effects enhancing drops in the
shade candlelight I think this is a
really gorgeous bronze color I'll do a
little swatch on my hand for you so it
is this right here as you can see it's
super super gorgeous it's like I said
like a bronzy kind of quite cool in tone
but what the warmest one was really
really dark and I wanted to be able to
mix this in with my foundation yeah like
I said I'm gonna use this to like mix in
with my foundation give it a bit more of
a dewy finish I also really like this
and mixed in with cream bronzers to give
them more of a dewy finish as well bit
more of a bronze glow to the skin so you
can totally use these however you want
to yeah um the other ones are a bit too
light and they were also sold out when I
was there and the darkest one was just a
bit too dark for what I wanted to use it
for so if you're like me and have like
more of a chameleon skin tone this is
the color I would recommend and they're
super super interesting and I'm excited
to like play with it and try it out if
you follow me on snapchat you know I
tried this while I was out there and it
really does work but if you want to
review let me know
it is the glamour glow at pump live
Ovilla the glam glow at plumping lip
mask and the glossy finish they also did
this in a matte finish but that didn't
really appeal to me so much because I
was kind of a bit confused by it but
yeah so this is literally like a lip
treatment - really a plump up your lips
I kind of would recommend leaving this
on for about 20 minutes before wiping it
away and then applying your other lip
product I also put this on top of lip
products that I was already wearing to
just kind of really plump up my lips so
just as like a lip topper if that makes
sense
and not also work yeah so you twist it
like this
and that releases the kind of like wand
and then you take out the wand and apply
it to your lip like that yeah let me
know if you want like a review on this
or like a before and after or something
like that I can assure you it does work
because my lips were on fire when I was
using it and the girls I was with
definitely noticed a difference so yeah
let me know the next few things I got
from Sephora were more skincare related
so I picked
this scrub from Murad is their skin
smoothing polish deeply deeply
exfoliates and leaves skin soft and
smooth and helps relieve congested pores
for me I have quite clear skin but my
friends that are kind of like really
into skin always tell me that I've got
such like blocked pores on my nose and
like blackheads and stuff so I thought
this would be really helpful to to help
unclog them and I'm guessing me gonna
give this a try and maybe it's going to
be one of my new kind of go to skin care
products because I've seen desi Perkins
use it and you guys know her skin is
absolutely amazing so I'll see if this
works for me and I definitely plan to do
a skincare routine very very soon so
maybe you will see this in action then I
also picked up some Sephora coconut
wipes because I'm obsessed with coconut
like the scent and everything and also
coconut is really good for dehydrated
skin and I like to think I have
dehydrated skin because I really like to
keep it infused with products I love the
feel of like oils on my skin and like
really moisturizing products and yeah
coconut is really good for kind of
suiting the skin as well not that I have
like rosacea or anything but I used to
suffer from a bit of redness here so
that helps with there as well and
finally I picked up this is how many is
it one two three four five six this six
piece Peter Thomas Roth mask kit this
was kind of in the last minute minis
section along with some of the other
minutes that I showed you
but the Peter Thomas Roth is quite an
expensive skincare brand so when I saw
that they did minis of all their masks
and it was really discounted I really
wanted to try because there are a few in
there that I was really want to try but
didn't want to full-on go for the for
the full size of them so this is super
handy to try and I will see if any of
them are kind of my gonna be my go-to
and then I maybe I will purchase the
full-sized version I think you can get
Peter Thomas Roth in the UK but I don't
know about this mini set so yeah I'm
excited to try the 24 karat gold one
because that just sounds super luxurious
and finally the last three things I got
from Sephora are hair care products hair
is something that I definitely want to
focus a lot more on I always neglect my
hair and so into buying like makeup
products I kind of forget about it
so the first thing that I got was the
way
hair the way wave spray let me that's
right the way wave spray so this is from
the kardashian-jenner kin huh this is
her brand and I use this a bit while I
was in New York so basically my hair is
naturally kind of weight and naturally
wavy and but when I cut it and spray
this in it just gives that more of a
beachy feel a bit more kind of a crunchy
and like a bit more of a texture it's
like a really good texture spray so if
you are looking for to give your hair a
bit more kind of volume a bit more
texture I definitely recommend trying
this out then I got this from bumble and
bumble it's the high shine low hold
pomade and this says that it you spread
it through your fingers and use on dry
hair detainment add shine so I used this
for I'm gonna book I'm going to use this
for like sticking it down my baby hairs
because I've been really loving having
my hair up at the moment and what
hairdresser while I was out in New York
used something similar to this to really
flatten and tame my baby hairs and it
made it such a difference so yeah to
achieve a more sneaky a high bun look
without my baby has ruining it I am
going to use this so if you suffer from
that like me or like your hair gets
really frizzy and humidity recommend
this as well and finally this is a brand
that I've not heard of and I'm a sucker
for packaging and all of their packaging
was super Saluki this is from igk and it
is their conditioning a cleansing oil
now if this sounds like you because it
literally like was me it's straight away
a nice way I bought it I'm gonna test
this out and let you know how it goes
but it says to sweep away impurities
while nourishing your scalp with this
dream cocktail of coconut oil and
powerful hydrators perfect for anyone
looking for their healthiest lengths
ever especially with those with color
treated hair dry scalps and unruly curls
if you have blond hair and you've been
had like treatment on your hair and this
weather is like effing with your scalp
like it's with mine I'm really hoping
this is gonna like save me so I'll let
you know how I got on with this and I'm
really hoping it's just gonna give it
some kind of nourishment back into my
hair because everything about my hair is
just so so so dry at the moment the damn
weather and color treatment is
ruined it so I'm really hoping this is
going to save my hair there's everything
that I got from Sephora and now moving
on to Macy's Macy's is kind of like a
really good at stockist for Anastasia
Beverly Hills so I see it made short to
pick up some things if you saw my
snapchat earlier I actually when I got
home from New York
she'd kindly sent me as a PR package the
whole of the media foundation stick
range and the contour stick range but
while I was out there I actually picked
up the one in golden this is included in
the medium range so I'm glad I picked
the right color if she thought this was
the right color for me as well this is a
kind of medium it's a buildable coverage
and it has such such a gorgeous finish I
actually have it on my skin now as well
as the banana shade underneath my eyes
and the mink shade as the link or fawn I
think I'm I used as the contour shade
such a gorgeous foundation I think I
still prefer the hourglass one so like I
said let me know if you want like a
comparison or review with this and any
of the other ones that I mentioned
earlier yes such a gorgeous finish on
the skin and I've been really obsessing
with stick foundations at the moment and
then blending it out with a Beauty
Blender so if you wanted to try a stick
foundation this is a good one to try
then I picked up the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow Wiz in soft brown I've not
actually owned it in the shade and I've
run out of all my other browsers and at
Fashion Week everyone kind of had a lot
more of a soft natural brow and I
remember from it using this in the past
that this you can get such a soft
natural brow with this so I definitely
wanted to try it out I mean I'm all down
for the Instagram brow and like using
the dip brows to get it really sculpting
but on days I want it to be really quick
this is such a go-to for me and I really
love the color as well it's super cool
tone and I can kind of really mimic the
appearance of brow hairs with it so
definitely wanted to pick up another one
of those while they were there and
finally I made a little custom quad if
you buy for single shadows you get a
free palette to go with it so I picked
up some of my favorite shades to kind of
customize and make a little like travel
palette with I think I have these some
of these shades but some of they're all
in like separate custom
it's that she's come out with so I
wanted to kind of get them as individual
one so I could put in a little palette
like this so these are the ones I picked
up we have gleam orange Schroeder gleam
orange soda red and this one is called
rtw if you guys would be interested in
seeing like a minimal look with things
like this or if you just want to know if
the Anastasia but the hill show is it
worth getting let me know in the
comments down below so the next door
that I went to was CVS which I was super
excited about it's essentially just an
American drugstores I was able to pick
up some really interesting bits so I'll
probably get the most least interesting
thing out of the way first
look at words these are my favorite
favorite makeup wipes so many people
rave about them you can get them in the
UK but only on Amazon so online I've not
seen these in stores so I definitely
wanted to stock up while I was there so
I picked up a few of bits from L'Oreal
so I picked up the L'Oreal infallible
poreless foundation we do have this in
the UK but the color range isn't the
same the packaging is also different and
I'm kind of hoping this one just might
be a little bit better so I got this in
the shade 108 caramel beige which is the
same shade as desi Perkins so I'm hoping
it's gonna it's gonna be okay it is a
Demi matte finish and I'm yet to open it
and try it so if you want to review on
that let me know because I've got
another one here so let me know if you
want like a comparison video so yeah
like I said the other one I picked up
was the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow so
this one is more of a dewy finish I have
tried this already and it looks stunning
on the skin this one is in the shade 209
caramel beige again I think this one
might be a little bit darker than that
one but on the skin and when I use like
a light highlighter underneath the eyes
and stuff it really bounced out and gave
such a gorgeous finish on the skin see
if you want a review on either of them
or a comparison it says up to 24 hours
as well so like I said if you want a
review on it let me know don't think
this is available in the UK yet but I'm
sure it will be coming probably in a
different packaging like everything else
that they do but yes I'm loving this one
then these instantly caught my eye and I
have
cinnamony UK yet but correct me if I'm
wrong these a two of the infallible
eight-hour wear galoshes and they're
like a Pearlie new golden finish which
is exactly what I look for in a lip
gloss and the fact that this said it had
like eight hour wear really calls to me
because the problem with glosses is that
they never last and they always come off
and you have to reapply I'm super
excited to try these I've got one that
is the kind of more like a pearly pink
one and this one is in the shade 105
petal and then one that was slightly
more of a golden pink color is in the
405 coral sand so yeah super affordable
nude lip gloss if I may add and I'm sure
they look amazing I've not tried them
yet but I'm sure they're going to look
amazing on the skin anything with a
pearly finish I'm absolutely in love
with and finally from L'Oreal I picked
up the loonie True Match Lumi liquid
gold illuminator prime and highlight
this is the product that I was talking
about when I mentioned earlier that I
was obsessed with mixing that hourglass
primer is with this so this is like a
liquid illuminator I've not seen it in
the UK but again correct me if I'm wrong
I'm sure it'll be coming if it's not
already or it might just be in different
packaging but this is like a like I said
a liquid illuminator it's more of a
golden finish that I love mixing this in
with my primer because it does have
priming qualities to it like it says and
it gives such a gorgeous glow to the
skin and then for you to put your
foundation on the top it just acts as a
really gorgeous base so finally from CVS
I have got some bits from Maybelline and
NYC so from Maybelline you guys know I
already have this already but in America
they have such a more extensive color
range
I want the Maybelline it fit me matte
and poreless foundation in it three
three two which is a little bit darker
bit more warmer bit more yellow so I was
definitely going to pick one of these up
we def we do have this in the UK but the
color range is just so proud oh this one
is really good for normal to oily skin
because it's got a matte finish and I'm
obsessed with the coverage of this and
then also from Maybelline I got one of
their 24-hour color tattoos which are
amazing as you guys already know but I
saw this color and I really wanted
something that was more of a paler gold
and I saw this and I don't think you
have it in the UK this one is called a
fairly a brown
did and it is this kind of color so a
really gorgeous champagne e gold so it
looks like this and I really like using
a cream kind of eyeshadows at the moment
to carve out my crease and clean up any
mess so definitely excited to try this
one
I would it probably put my cake eggman
over the top of it to set it in place or
like a foiled eyeshadow of a similar
color just a little tip of what I would
use it for and finally the last place
that I went shopping was Rickey's and we
don't have a Ricky's in the UK and it is
filled with like your favorite brands
like BH Cosmetics morphe and stuff like
that so I definitely wanted to pick some
bits are oh crap I forgot to say also
from CVS I got two of the NYC liquid
liners in extreme black cause you guys
know this is like my ride-or-die liquid
liner and I know it is for a lot of
other people as well so they had it in
extreme black so I definitely want to
make sure I picked up two anyway yes
from Ricky's the first thing that I got
because it was the person I saw and I
walked in was the BH Cosmetics at Carli
bybel palette it is gorgeous it is got
similar mobiie tones to the Tarte
palette and obviously it's got these
four incredibly pigmented highlighted
shades at the bottom so you guys have to
let me know you want to see a look with
this because I'm obsessed with the
pigmentation of these the price that
they were and I'm sure you guys are
going to want to know what this is like
any other tried it already
also I got two of the NYX prism a
prismatic eyeshadows I know you can't
get these in the UK but I just wanted to
pick some up while I was there I got
this bronzy copper golden shade and it
is the color liquid gold and this one is
in the shade a bedroom eyes bit more of
a dark bronze but as you can see it
don't be smashed in my suitcase so I'm
going to try and press it down with
alcohol so I can use it
yeah these NYX Prisma prismatic
eyeshadows are super super pigmented you
have such a gorgeous foiled finish as
well if you use mixing liquid
primer as well or fix+ they'll give me
super super intense so mcfluffster tried
these colors because the only one I had
previously to this is like a pale pink
and these are definitely more of my kind
of colors up my street then I got two
more nude glosses yes someone stopped me
but these are my brand that I've never
heard of it is called how lad Palladio
I think and that they are
lumping lipglosses as well so I'm
obviously gonna be obsessed with these
one of them is slightly clearer and one
of them is more of a nude the Clara one
is called Diamond Eyes and then the top
one is called pearly pink I think so
yeah you guys know I'm gonna be obsessed
with these and I'm probably gonna be
featuring them a lot in my videos and
then the last thing I picked up was a
nail varnish and I think this is part of
the new Essie full range because I
hadn't seen it before but it is called
time for me time and it's like a nude
obviously and this is definitely gonna
be the next nude that I get my nails
painted with but I'm not sure if the
light is gonna pick it up but it has
like a pearlescent finish and like brie
flecks of pink which is so so so
gorgeous so I'm obsessed with this and I
literally cannot wait to paint my nails
with it so that is everything that I
picked up from America I know it's quite
a lot and it really affected my luggage
weight when I bought it back I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video
