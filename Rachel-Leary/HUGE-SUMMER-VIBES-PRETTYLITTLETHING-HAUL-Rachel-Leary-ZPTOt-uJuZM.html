so today we are doing another clothing
haul and this time is all from a pretty
little thing they're literally one of my
favorite online retailers you guys know
this and I've partnered with them on
this video because one that they know
I'm obsessed with them and two I love
showing you guys all their new things
I'm always on their new in page and then
new at summer collection stuff is fun ah
I just thought you guys loved my last
haul so I would bring you guys another
one it's gonna be slightly different
last time I inserted clips but this time
I thought I'm gonna kind of style all my
items together in the way that I would
so you can see how I'd wear them and
just kind of speak about them as I try
them on so hope you guys appreciate that
if you like the sound of this already
then make sure to give it a thumbs up
subscribe if you haven't already and hit
that notification bell it's time for our
post notification bell shout out and
this week it goes to the Millie and who
says you're so inspiring and great
makeup artist notification bell on as
always thank you as so much honestly it
means the world to me reading your
comments and support I love you guys so
so much or with out how they do and
let's get right into the wall
okay so the first thing that I'm going
to be talking about is this jumper right
here like how appropriate is this right
now it's a Sunday right now Sunday's are
meant for spending and just kind of like
lounging around chilling out and I just
thought this was perfect they do it in
another color they do it in like a cream
and then the sunday isn't like a camel
nude color but I love pinky Purple's and
I thought I would have match it with my
lip I thought this I know this is like a
summer holiday clothing haul but
honestly this fabric is one of that kind
it's kind of like a not like towel
fabric but you know I mean it's just
kind of like close to it and super
comfortable the sleeves are really baggy
it's just super oversized in general and
sometimes in the summer it's not always
you know like that warm and like I said
in my previous haul I love it just
tucking in kind of like oversized
jumpers to shorts maybe just to kind of
mix it up slightly kind of be warm on
the top but cool on the bottom so in the
day set it's kind of more mild you're
kind of getting a best of both and I
just love the big kind of print across
of it like I said it is so comfortable
but speaking of shorts I'm going to show
you the pair of shorts that I got okay
so another thing I fear this just kind
of like a staple for summer it's just a
pair of denim shorts now these are kind
of like they're called like a scuba
style Shore and I'm obsessed with them
denim shorts are so hard to shop for
because I don't want them riding up my
bum I don't want to like chafe or
anything like that I just want to feel
comfortable in a pair of shorts and
recently I've been loving wearing shorts
with like thigh high boots a blazer and
a bodysuit like that for me that's a
really comfortable outfit to wear on a
night out per say and these ones are
amazing I know they do this start up
short in like a light wash denim red a
nude they do in so many colors and
honestly some of the most comfortable
shorts I have ever worn literally my bum
isn't like showing but it's not you know
like not showing it's not like granny
shorts these are honestly the perfect
style of fit for me like I said you can
just like wear it tucked in with a
jumper bright lip I feel like you're
good to go
but yet these are so uncomfortable I'm
planning
pick them up in many different colors
perfect for the summer again like I said
try wearing them with like thigh high
boots a bodysuit a blazer you'll be so
surprised how like it sounds really
dressy but really it's not you know
you're just kind of rain shorts boots
and a blaze I like just try it yeah
right now I'm just starting this with
this jumper and a bold lip and I feel
like I could you know I could go out I
have a Sunday race you know something
like that but yet these shorts are not
so uncomfortable if you're looking for
denim shorts and like you've always
struggled with them being too you're
like up your bum or anything like that
try these I've left the link to them
down below like I said they do loads of
different colors but I just thought I
actually don't own a pair of black denim
shorts like what the hell I feel like
that's a necessity for summer they'll
just go with everything so so so
comfortable really true to size as well
so yeah love these okay so the next
thing I picked up is this white satin
kind of button-up shirt I also picked up
this like neon pink really funky like
brawler I love kind of t-shirt bras I
set this in my previous hole like I just
love a t-shirt bra because who the hell
wants to be very like I padded underwire
bra when it's super hot and like this I
just thought was such a fun color and it
just kind of like pops through like a
shirt and you can kind of really oh no I
made sure to get this shirt in like an
oversized fit then I got this in a large
and if you're like me my cup size is
like a e TT e I think it's more like an
email I've got this in a medium and I
like I don't feel like I'm bulging out
of it or anything like that so just keep
that in mind yeah I wouldn't necessarily
wear it with shorts I felt like this was
more like a shirt and jeans type vibe
and cuz you've got this pop of pink
coming through you can kind of mix it up
and have like a pub of pink on your lip
or you guys know I have these like pink
shoes some pretty little thing as well
like I imagine this kind of tucked into
like a pair of jeans with a belt kind of
a look like loosely tucked in with like
a pop of pink of your shoes as well but
I feel like having like underwear that's
really brightly colored but it's almost
like underwear as outerwear you know
like it's like designs to be shown off
it's not like your granny bra from Marks
and Spencers thats like you've got on
the show like this is like a nice broad
- well show it's so detailed and like
looks really cool just kind of like
popping through like your shirt or
something like that or if you have like
a mesh kind of t-shirt vibe and you wear
like I don't know like a bandeau top
underneath like this is kind of like a
nice alternative it's like a fun bright
color
I'm loving pink can you tell for like
the summer time it just reminds me of
that flower emoji you know and that just
always reminds me of summer yeah I just
thought these two looked really cool
together just kind of like it's like
you're casually a but you're not
but maybe
but you never know but that's for you to
find out but we'll look sophisticated at
the same time plus satin in the summer
is a very comfortable fabric
I got it in white because I feel like
sweat patches don't really show up so
much on white and yeah it's a good
really a comfortable area fabric I've
got mine kind of oversized so it would
be more slouchy so that like brawler and
stuff would peep through yeah I left the
links to these down below so you can
kind of see a close-up of maybe like the
brawler and stuff and how and what that
looks like because I won't be getting
mature stars out on the camera yeah
imagine it with maybe like a belt - oh
the possibilities are okay so this was
another thing that I picked up
it is a playsuit how gorgeous is this
I'm like visualizing this with like
white strappy heels that kind of go all
the way up to the top but I still have
that brawler on I was gonna take it off
but actually looks kind of cool like
maybe if I wore the pink heels with it
or something but I just feel like it's
such a flattering shape
peplum always hides a multitude of sins
and I kind of feel like the matching
sleeves give it more of like a slowy
feel I feel so comfortable in there so I
can't even tell you like I feel like I
could
I'm like I'm like down to have like fun
in this play see I think it's so
comfortable
I really loved the peplum and the frills
I feel like it gives a really floaty a
summery vibe you could obviously put
like a belt round it maybe a white place
suit just like never goes amiss in the
summer plus it makes your tan look pop
it like I feel like it's a super
flattering shape it kind of hugs really
nicely on ear but I may have even got
this in a slightly its smaller size I
think this is a 12 milk I could get it
in like a 10 but it would really like
pressurize my boobs but honestly I think
that this is just so perfect for summer
you could wear it with sandals wear it
with heels I feel like it's just a super
comfortable place suit the fabric
there's no slips on this oh my god I
hate buying play suits with zips that
kind of have no stretch it's kind of
like you've got to fit in it or you have
to send it back this one it's like a
really super stretchy material which i
think is amazing it's like it's called
like a scuba material I think I'm not
sure but honestly like this is so
comfortable I feel really kind of
confident in this I feel like I could
dress this up or dress this down it
makes me tan look a real aged hand and I
feel confident to wiggle around I'm
gonna get dance tonight let me know if
you'd wear this in the comments section
down below and if so what with because I
am obsessed with it okay and finally
maybe I'm now looking at it like I
wouldn't wear these like all together
but they're kind of kind of went so
these are the final items this is
actually like a two-piece there's a
blazer going on and a necklace so let me
start off with the necklace so the
necklace has a cross and it's kind of
one of those necklaces that you're
seeing everywhere at the moment I just
thought this was like a really nice
simple version of that necklace I know
this is about layered necklaces and all
that kind of stuff but I just thought
this is really nice just to wear like
everyday a really kind of simple kind of
design going on it would goes with like
everything and it's really on trend I
know this is like super affordable as
well and it's like let's shipping out
stock for age but I'm pretty sure this
one is still in stock and I've left it
linked down below I just thought this
was really pretty and just
cash everyday bish bash Bosh look at my
necklace okay taking in the blazer off
can we just talk about this like I said
it is a two-piece but I feel like the
shorts come up high enough that it kind
of looks like a playsuit I am obsessed
with this tribal print like this isn't
really like free-floating top these
shorts a super like frilly and floaty as
well
I thought the pattern was just so
gorgeous it's so fun I thought you could
wear these with white shoes black shoes
black boots blue shoes like yellow shoes
literally anything and I just feel like
it adds a little bit of something to an
outfit and with a summer coming up I am
all about prints and stuff I just think
this is so fun I own nothing like this
and I just thought this is kind of like
it's out there but it's not at the same
time obviously I wouldn't wear like a
pink lipstick with this but I am just
loving this it feels very like the
Saatchi maybe do you know I mean just
kind of like that kind of expensive
looking
satin print I love this it's so
comfortable to wear I feel so kind of
like airy and free like I'm not gonna
get like too hot in this just like
imagine this on a like with a tan put
like a black kimono on flip flops on
really dress it down or just like with
some like plain black heels or maybe the
own holiday some like white strappy
heels a little bit of like you know
maybe a jacket or something I'm just
loving this I feel like there's so many
ways you can style this or like with a
big pair of hoop earrings I am so on
that vibe right now I think that this is
just so pretty and a pretty little thing
I'd have some incredible to pieces with
like amazing prints on them this is just
the one that I picked up but definitely
checked out there are the ones because I
know I'm there's definitely going to be
going on more than just this one and
finally I did get you know I did
intentionally get this to wear with this
I was just suddenly looking and I was
like hey that color is there like they
kind of go together but I mean like you
know maybe this must it's like a little
bit too much with all of this going on
but I actually wore this place of the
other day this pretty little thing
blazer I think it's called their
boyfriend blazer I have it in nearly
every color the fit it's like perfect
it's just like slightly oversized I can
drink over my shoulders when I wear it
it's really really comfortable it's not
too big I think I get mine in a size 14
maybe say if you're kind of like my size
that's the kind of size I would go for
but I wore this the other day with a
black bodysuit some light blue denim
shorts black thigh highs and my belt
that has like my gold Gucci belt with
the gold in the middle which really kind
of tied everything all together I got so
many compliments on it and I actually
really love this mustard color if you're
kind of other I need you know I think it
would go everyone I was gonna say if
you're kind like tanned with dark hair
then maybe this would be more up your
vibe but I'm picturing like my sister in
this color and she is like fair fair
skinned and I know she loves this color
as well
it's one of those colors that like don't
be scared to try it because it actually
looks so nice and it's one of those
colors that I feel like if you work you
will be like hey you know you're looking
sweet black honey baby yeah I mean this
is what this just looks like with this
I'd probably wear like a black blazer
bungles gonna wear plays with this and
we'll just use this as like a statement
piece like you would a bright lipstick
yeah they're boyfriend blazer the one I
linked it down below if you like blazes
like me or you've never even thought
about wearing Blazers I wanna see all my
friends will tell you iron blazer
obsessed I love them because well yeah
hitch like I said one of my favorite
outfits to wear is just like something
maybe like short with thigh high boots
and like something kind of strappy but
I'm the kind of person I don't really
like to get my arms out too much I'm the
kind of person that's like man's in a
hot I'm gonna keep my jacket on in a cab
at 750 degrees but Blazers are just kind
of like the more feminine jacket they
just kind of throw it on go with
everything if you don't necessarily
get in like the mustard color check out
their like nude blacks like but they
definitely do other pops of color as
well I was thinking about maybe getting
the red one or something like that I
don't know I just think they're so fun
it's so easy to wear so comfortable I
just I love this whole thing so that was
it for my kind of like holiday by
brightly colorful fun
pretty little thing hole I really hope
