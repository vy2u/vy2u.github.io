I've already primed my eyes and done my
brows then I am taking this Amalfi at 35
B palette I think this is and there's a
pastel pink eyeshadow and this is gonna
be our initial transition color where
originally it where originally we're
gonna start off doing kind of like a
smoky eye so just doing the normal steps
okay going from light to dark so I'm
going in with this magenta pink color
just blending that to further deepen up
the crease on a slightly smaller fluffy
brush then going back in with that big a
fluffy brush that we had the pale pink
on and just making sure everything is
all a blended out seamlessly then going
in with a black eye shadow I'm just
concentrating this mainly on the
outermost part of my eye and just
gradually are buffing that into the
crease we don't take that too far over
but again just going back in with our
brushes that we used previously not with
really any extra product just making
sure that is all blended together and
creating it that smoky eye effect for
the lid I'm just taking it the matte
white from the same palette and just
going over that empty lid space
then I'm taking a wipe to clean up the
edge and create that winged effect for
when we do the winged eyeliner and for
this cuz it's gonna be pink glitter on
the top I wanted a pink base so I am
taking the Too Faced a sketch marker in
I think this is like candy pink or
Barbie pink I think it might be candy
pink I've listed all the products down
below and I'm just creating that classic
winged it shape and because like I said
we're gonna go in with glitter I'm going
over the line up with the two-faced
glitter glue and then this glitter is
the ballerina glitter from a coastal
step stand sense so I'm just taking a
little brush and just going over the
liner like I said and then taking
another little brush this one is from
lit cosmetics I think comes with the
glitter that they sell and then I'm at
just pressing that over the top and then
cleaning up underneath with a makeup
wipe then just go back in it to the
crease if you want to just tidy up or
just get it as perfect as you want and
now we can go on to lashes these are the
house of lashes knockout lashes and the
proceeds towards this actually do go
towards breast cancer awareness which is
kind of what inspired me for this pink
look so definitely make sure to check
them out below but this is kind of the
finished eyes onto the skin I just
primed my skinnies in the Nivea post
shave balm and for foundation I used the
hourglass stick but it doesn't really
matter cuz we're gonna be covering off
the face anyway with pain I'm then
taking the edge-to-edge lip pencil from
Mac which is basically just any sort of
pink lip liner and I'm just erasing kind
of the outline I googled what a skull
would look like so I knew it where to go
and I went in with pink because we were
gonna go in with pink paint afterwards
if you choose to do this in any color I
would recommend using a pencil the kind
of same color that you're going to be
using so it's not going to be visible
when you fill everything in then I'm
just going ahead and doing the teeth if
you just Google a half the skull it is
so easy to visually recreate that's how
I find it easier to do then I am taking
the smithee's and makeup effects paint
in the color white and I am just filling
in in all the bits that I wanted to the
white zone s not so everything that I
didn't want to appear Hollow
then I'm taking a thin angled brush and
just using that to get into all the
little places that the slightly thicker
brush couldn't get so just down the
bridge of my nose and in between the
teeth to give that extra detail and
precision with the white color and then
I just went ahead and pressed this white
eyeshadow all over basically just to set
it all in place then I'm taking the
Anastasia Beverly Hills on waterproofing
cream color in the shade Barbie pink I
think what it's either Barbie pink or
candy pink between that liner and this
product but and this is what I'm just
using it to it fill in all the bits that
I want to appear Hollow so this is where
on a classic skull it would be black so
you can use either pink face paint for
this or anything I just had this pink
and I thought it would blend really
nicely so I'm just using that to outline
and add definition and detail and like I
said just kind of placing it in all the
places that I want to appear hollow and
then just adding little shading details
to give it a bit more of a realistic
finish then taking that little brush
again I'm using this to fill in the
teeth just because it is slightly more
of a smaller area so I wanted to choose
a smaller brush to do so and then went
back in with the white paint so it
really it defined the teeth even more
then I just dragged it kind of from the
mouth to create the appearance of kind
of like a jaw and a mouth and this is
the finished look then I am taking that
light pink eyeshadow that we used
earlier from the same palette and I'm
just using this to create shading and
definition and just kind of give it a
bit more of a realistic 3d appearance
now it was time for the fun part I'm
taking the two-faced glitter glue again
and you can do what all like places
wherever you want but basically just
place this anywhere you want the glitter
to be so I just kind of used it around
the outside
then I used it around my brows used it
kind of to define my jaw and then I took
that same at Coastal Scents at glitter
and then I mixed it up and added a bit
of the NYX red glitter in there as well
it's called red bits actually a really
dark pink and it just placed that along
the top just mixing up you can be as
creative as you want with this and then
again I repeated the same process along
the teeth and I kind of mix the two
litters together for a lot of it but to
create oh my god I'm actually online
meant to create more of a 3d effect is
what I meant to say and yet like I said
did the same along at the bottom as well
and then it just took a little brush and
it's a bit more of that anastasia
beverly hills cream color just to add a
bit more kind of like definition and
just little features to complete the
look
then on my lower lash line I'm it taking
that sketch marker from two-faced again
kind of creating a lower lash a lower
lower lash line if that makes sense so
just kind of extending it inwards and
then going back in with that magenta
eyeshadow to really buff it out and that
is the finished eye look we then they're
gonna go ahead and apply like the bottom
lash mascara or whatever you can apply
pink to the water sign you can do
whatever you want with this look feel
free to be as creative as you want so
this is the end result I really hope you
