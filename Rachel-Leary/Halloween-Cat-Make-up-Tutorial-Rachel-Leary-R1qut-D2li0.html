Halloween makeup tutorial so to start I
am just priming my eyes with my soft
ochre Paint Pot then going in with my
Mac fluidline in black track as another
base for when we apply the dark eye
shadow this is just going to make sure
that the black eye shadow we put on top
is super intense then using the exotic
Lotus palette from Velvet 59 using this
sparkly black eye shadow and like I said
just pressing that over the top of the
black base
using the shade poppy from makeup geek
which is essentially just a really nice
map ready pink shade I am using this as
our initial transition shade and buffing
that into the crease
after that I am using I think it's
razzle razzle berry from makeup geek
which is this gorgeous sparkly pink
shade just using that to further deepen
the socket
I'm the theme of this cat look I was
going for is pink but you could pick any
color like purple or blue and just
replace anything that I use with a pink
tone with that color of your choice
then using drama queen from makeup geek
which is essentially just a sparkly
purpley black shade just using that to
create that transition and further
deepen up the socket I see a lot of
questions in my comments asking where I
get my makeup heat products from before
being sent a lot of eyeshadows which I
am so grateful for I always used to
purchase them directly from the website
and if you're from the UK like me the
tax honestly and the shipping isn't that
bad so I recommend doing so if you want
to try them out then as always I'm just
using a wipe to clean up the mess and
create that feline winged flick shape
I wanted a really bright in a corner so
I'm going in with ghetto from Mac on a
really big domed fluffy brush this one
is from crown so it's gonna apply a lot
more products in a smaller pencil brush
wood and just buffing that into my inner
corner then for eyeliner I'm kind of
applying my liquid line as I normally
would in the winged style but I'm gonna
be extending it in the inner corner as
you'll see so that's why I thought I
would include a clip of this in this
tutorial because normally I just skipped
through this but I thought I would show
you the steps on how I do it
and this is what the finished eyeliner
should look like then using carbon from
Mac I'm just cutting up my crease
lightly to emphasize that feline look
then just applying a light coat of
mascara this is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara but I'm gonna be using
false eyelashes I'm using the velour
ones in lashing City I do have a coupon
code which is linked down below
then for foundation I'm using my ex1
foundation in the shade F 200 I haven't
used this foundation in so long but it's
such a nice coverage I didn't want to go
in with anything too heavy just because
we're gonna be applying some other
makeup on the top then using my
Maybelline age rewind concealer using
that to conceal underneath my eyes
nothing too much just because like I
said we're going to be going in with
some other face makeup
to set my skin I'm using my Mac Studio
Fix powder in the shade NC 20 just like
I said to set everything in place and
give a matte finish to the skin because
it's going to make that a lot easier
when applying other face products to the
eyes I wanted to really smoke out my
lower lashline with a really white shade
so I'm using my white noise pencil from
sleek and like I said just lining my
lower lash line really quite messily as
well as my waterline cuz we're going to
be buffing it out with a white eyeshadow
on a pencil brush like I said really
smoking out cuz you want this to look
really dramatic and make the eyes appear
really big like a cat
then just tidying up my eyeliner wear
the white eyeliner may have smudged it
slightly and that is what the eyes
should look like then going back in with
the razzle berry eyeshadow I'm using
this to fill in my eyebrows you guys
don't have to do that I just thought it
would adds the kind of Halloween party
makeup look and it kind of went with the
theme of the cap now for the mouth I'm
using this brow pencil from Kiko I think
this is in the shade number two just to
trace the outline I'm using this because
it's a really pale shade so if I make
any mistakes it'll be really easy to
clear up but I kind of can't really
explain what I'm doing you just have to
kind of watch but just creating a giant
Cheshire Cat mouth shape and when I was
happy with it I went over it with a
black eyeliner like so then using the
white eyeliner from sleek I use this to
create the teeth I created two big extra
fangs to add to this kind of scarier cat
look then all the other teeth are just
kind of as usual I then filled in kind
of the gaps using face paint I use this
snazaroo face paint I just got it from
Amazon like so
onto the nose I'm just taking a black
pencil and lightly tracing the kind of
shape I wanted I don't really like that
classic circle dot cat nose because I
don't really think that's very realistic
so I'm almost creating a heart shape
nose just outlining the natural and
shape to my nose and then filling it in
with this Barbie pink cream color base
from Anastasia Beverly Hills but you
could just use Mac Mac the snazaroo like
face paint set or any other pain or like
a lipstick or something and I'm then
just outlining the nose with the black
eyeliner just to make it more prominent
and defined
then using this eyeliner brush from
bdellium tools and the black face paint
I'm just creating three little freckles
on each cheek and then three little
whiskers to finish off the cat look
finally using that Razzleberry shadow
again just to create a bit of shading on
the outermost part of the mouth and just
extending it slightly and buffing it
downwards I'm doing this on the mouth
and then on my forehead as well you
could go as far as to kind of get
matching spray paint and spray that into
your hair or something like that but I
just thought I'd shade the tops of my
forehead and that is it for this look a
bit of a twist on the classic cat look
but I hope you guys enjoyed it give it a
thumbs up if you did if you do recreate
