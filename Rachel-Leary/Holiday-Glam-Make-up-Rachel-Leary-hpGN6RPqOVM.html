starting off with my eyebrows already
done using my anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow and medium brown I'm just going
ahead and applying my eye primer is it
the Maybelline Color tattoo in the shade
creme de Rose which is basically a
really similar to Mac's painterly paint
if you have that and like I said it's
just applying a thin layer all over my
eyelid using my morphe 35o palette and
this really soft brown shade i'm just
buffing that into the crease using a
fluffy brush as our initial transition
shade
to deepen up the socket I'm taking this
dark warmer brown shade makeup eat cocoa
bet it's pretty similar and using this
defined crease brush to like I said
deepen up the socket and get really
precise movements but then buffing it
out into our initial transition shade
just by going back and using the fluffy
brush that we used before not with any
excess products just to make sure the
gradients nice and smooth to add some
warmth I'm mixing these two colors
together and sort of taking this more
onto the lid and the kind of red shade
is gonna act as a transition for when we
apply a lid color so if my lid I'm
mixing razzle berry and puffy from
makeup geek as a kind of a brighter
under layer getting into the festive
spirit I wanted to use kind of more reds
and stuff like that so I'm using that
and then going back in with a fluffy
brush just to make sure all the edges
are really soft and blended together
then I'm using my Too Faced glitter glue
and my obsessive compulsive cosmetics
glitter in beige which you guys know is
my favorite and just pressing that on
the top so you can see the Reds that we
applied don't show too vividly so
they're not too bright or too unwearable
then I'm going in with this dark brown
from the same at morphe palette to
further deepen the crease and create
that smoky effect
then as always I'm using a wipe to clean
up my mess and create that winged out
effect then going back in with a
slightly deeper brown it doesn't really
matter if you go underneath where you
just cleaned up because obviously you
can just continue to clean up with the
wipe I'm just further deepening the
socket and then on a big fluffy flat
brush this one's from Sigma I'm taking a
black eyeshadow just to create a really
intense outer corner like that and then
just taking a matte cream eyeshadow and
highlighting my inner corner and brow
bone this one I think I used the lighter
shade from the morphe palette but
obviously you can use whatever you have
to hand then I'm using my NYC liquid
liner to create a wing like so and then
I'm just going ahead and the prank
mascara you guys can leave it there but
will it look like this obviously you
guys know I'm gonna be wearing lashes
these are my vendor lashes in cluster a
holic and they just have a really
gorgeous fluttering wing and as you guys
know I have a discount code which is all
down below
moving onto skin I am taking my Smashbox
hydrating primer and just massaging that
into my face and then I'm using my Mac
Studio Fix fluid foundation in the shade
NC 30 you guys know my face is a lot
paler so I do have to color match so
give me time and I will look normal then
using my NARS creamy concealer in the
shade vanilla just applying that in the
usual places this one's a tiny bit
lighter then at my skin tone so I kind
of use it as a base layer for
highlighting as you guys will see but
yet just applying that in the usual
places and blending out with my Real
Techniques sponge
then I'm using my bulb at 59 contour is
a girl's best friend palette which you
guys can get 20% off until a Monday with
the code rate 20 you can use it for
highlighting contouring strobing it
comes with all the necessary steps to do
so and I love it's like a cream to
powder finish so if you guys are getting
into that kind of thing I definitely
recommend grabbing it while you can
then I'm taking my hourglass ambient
lighting power in the shade dim infusion
I think and just setting my under eyes
and all the places that I highlighted
then taking my makeup forever hate my
makeup forever sculpting doer in the
shade number two and using the bonding
shade to just basically set in place
with cream contouring that I did then it
using this mineralized blusher from Mac
in the shade dainty just like I said
applying blusher kind of to the highest
points of my cheeks and taking it quite
far back then to highlight I am using my
mary-lou manizer by the balm on this
Anastasia highlighting brush and just
taking it on my Cupid's bow and the ends
of my nose and stuff like that then
using this soft brown shaping more
people are just running that under my
eyes softly as I didn't want anything
too intense as all the kind of attention
is on what's going on on my lids and
just applying the bottom lash mascara
and that is the eyes completed you have
to ignore my mascara face
onto the lips I wanted to keep it pretty
nude because like I said the eyes are
the main focus so I'm just lining my
lips with my NYX nude beige lip pencil
and then filling them in with the
Geoffrey start liquid lipstick in the
shade I'm nude I literally am in love
with this combination it's like a really
kind of cool tone light nude and then
just for that extra glitter to kind of
match the eyes I am using the Mac dazzle
glass in the shade sugar rimmed and that
is the finished look I really hope you
guys liked this look I love love love
glam looks so I'm so happy to do this
