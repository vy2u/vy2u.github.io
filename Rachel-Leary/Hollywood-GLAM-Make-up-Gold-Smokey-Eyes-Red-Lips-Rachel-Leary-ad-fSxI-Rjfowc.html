I'm just really excited right now
Beauty watching
in a bargain
I just got ahead and primed my iron done
my eyebrows but to finish off my
eyebrows I'm just going to take the it
sleek brow intensity in the shade light
I'm just going to run it via spoolie
through my eyebrows because you know
like me I would like my blonde hair I
quite like to have a slightly darker
brow to like match with my roots but
then I like to put like a blight brow
pin over the top just to kind of match
the blond so this is perfect to do that
and then once I've done that I'm going
to use the other end of the brow
intensity and just use that to highlight
my brow bone so I'm really feel like
doing quite like an intensely shimmery
brow bone highlight so this is going to
be a good primer for that I put a slight
angle as well so it makes it really good
touch get under Neath then you can drag
it down so with that done we can now
move on to eyeshadow now this is one of
my top three picks it is the eyeshadow
palette in a new day and it looks like
this I'm in love with all the colors on
here they're so warm there's a range of
matte and shimmer tones I feel like I
can create like a really gorgeous
everyday look with this and also it can
take it into the night time I feel like
this is a perfect eye shadow palette for
like beginners as well because all the
colors are super kind of neutral and
warm and really complementary to like
literally every eye color which is why
it's one of my faves if our initial
transition color I'm just going to mix
this cream shade and this shade here as
kind of like an initial warm Brown
transition I'm just going to bust that
into my crease using a big fluffy brush
and using kind of back and forth motions
on a slightly smaller fluffy brush I'm
just going to use the brown shade not
mix it with a light one and just use
that further deepen up the crease then
I'm going in with be a dark brown shade
here from the same eyeshadow palette and
kind of mixing it between the brown as
well just as initially quite soft and
I'm going to use that to give it a bit
more of a smoky glamour if you've never
tried sleek eyeshadows I definitely
recommend picking up one of their
palettes they are if you have a pallet
for like everyone that if you're
intimating more pastel colors or more
smokey eye colors and like cool tone
colors there's literally one for
everyone or like if you prefer more
color they have loads you guys know me I
love a warm smokey eye which obviously I
just made it into my top picks I'm just
going to use circular motions to pass
that in and then out and then you're
going back in with on this short fluffy
brush and just diffusing out the edges
from a nude color I'm going to take this
gorgeous gold here it's like a really a
soft gold color and you can apply that
all over the lid kind of like to use
back and forth motions and then like
little parting motions just to really
build up the color just kind of taking
it 3/4 of the way across then going back
in with on medium a fluffy brush and
just dipping it slightly a mix between a
couple of the brown shades and just
diffusing the lid with the crease color
and then going back in with the brush
that we used for the dark brown and then
picking up a little bit more the dark
brown just reapplying that so it's super
intense and we haven't lost any of the
color anything we've kind of got that
nice classic gold gradient this is such
a neat I love hizmet honestly I'm going
to highlight my inner corner and brow
bone using this color here it's really
intense kind of pearly shimmery color so
before I do any kind of eyeliner I
always just like to highlight those bits
first and then under the brow as well
for that brow sculpt that we use kind of
acts as organized primer so the
highlight can appear a bit more like
intensely amazing so once you're happy
with the way that your eyeshadow look
from see it's 100% finished yeah I'm
just going to take a wipe and wipe away
and I kind of end towards the tail of my
brow that's why I kind of like doing my
eyebrows first and because it gives a
nice kind of guideline where I well well
where I want my wing to kind of go in
the angle of it
so once you've done that I'm now going
to go ahead and apply my winged eyeliner
and for that I'm going to use be a sleek
tippet eyeliner in black
the brush on this is really good for
like going in the inner corner because
it's really kind of firm and capered
which is good if you're not 100%
confident in that part now I'm just
going to do it the wing using like the
bottom of the eyeliner as like a guide
but it's done okay obviously it's not
100% because we've not done our skin yet
so you can use the wipe to clean it up
now I click down once you're happy with
your liner I'm then just going to clean
up the bottom of it again with a wipe
and really going to use my nail okay
super sharp edge so once you're happy
with the eye makeup you can go ahead and
apply mascara and lashes to complement
the look this is kind of what the top of
the eyes look like so really a classic
glam it totally needs so a really
gorgeous gold smokey eye but I did go
ahead and just do my base real quickly
and set my under eyes because I just
wanted to finish off the eye lip so I'm
just going to go ahead and apply the
dark brown shade that we used in the
crease and just really lightly press it
up into my lashline
I'm bended going to take that fluffy
brush that we used in the crease with
the medium brown shade which was this
one here and I'm just going to pick up a
tiny bit more of that color just kind of
on the top of the brush and just kind of
a buff that color in this is just going
to really smoke it out and make it
appear a lot softer so I just went ahead
and applied bottom lash mascara and
these are the finished eyes like I said
that a new day eyeshadow palette is in
my top three picks I'm obsessively like
I also said you can take it from a
day-to-night look it doesn't have to be
as kind of encompass glam as this but
you guys know me and this is by up my
street so yeah I love these kind of eye
looks moving on to the skin I'm going to
take the face form in the shade medium
and kind of mix these two colors
together and this is kind of going to
act as our like bronzer and contour just
slightly warmer shade has a really nice
shimmer to it so I love that I'm you
literally just dabbing them lightly in
both
pull it everywhere honey okay once even
applied your bronzer I'm now going to
apply it blusher and again this is
another product that I love this is the
rose gold blusher from sleek obviously I
always say this I'm not a massive
blusher wearer so anything that's kind
of more like a peachy or gold eeeh one
more time I really really like so this
is number two on my top picks and it is
the infamous sleek highlighting palette
in Cleopatra's kiss I love this one is
much more of a Columbia one and way more
up my street I always go on about this
it's literally one of my favorite
products of all time not even
necessarily just from a sleek if you've
never tried it before a hundred percent
recommend trying it honestly it just
makes your highlight pop so I'm just
going to kind of mix between both colors
because I am just that extra I like to
take a little fluffy brush to do this
you see this is why I love it so much
ah yes give it to me then I just like to
take the slightly lighter shade and put
that in the center of my nose and like
in between my brows and down the bridge
of my nose and then just lightly bronzy
a shade just on rye juices oh so again
the Cleopatra's kiss highlighting
palette is one of my top pick and speak
for itself is honestly amazing and now
on to my final pick so to go with this
kind of classic spam look I know you're
probably thinking I would have gone with
a nude but that's kind of so typically
me what other things do I literally love
and it is a red lip when I'm doing like
a classic glam look I love a red lip it
is my go-to for a bold color I'm pretty
sure literally all the red lip looks
I've done is using this one do you sleek
matte me in is it real a wreck I think
it's that I always struggle to pronounce
it anyway but this is my final top pick
I love the matte me range in general I
think it's a really gorgeous formula
they last a long time as well so I'm
just going to go ahead and apply this to
my lips
well can you make up you learn about
tones and colors and there's so many
different kinds of each shade like
there's loads of different tones of red
you can get more like a blue tone red
why like an orange tone red or a pink
tone red and for me this if you've got
blonde hair and blue eyes like me or
similar complexion to me then I hundred
percent recommend this one it's
literally might go to your favorite red
so this is the finished makeup look
obviously a classic gold smoky art you
guys know I love really a highlighted
skin and a bold red lip honestly one of
my favorite lips to do I'm so so honored
