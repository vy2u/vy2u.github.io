today I am doing a how-to on a color
correcting using the new sleek makeup
color correcting a kit I've teamed up
with sleek this video because you guys
love to the last video I did it was a
how-to on highlighting and contouring so
if you want to watch that I will leave
that in the link down below yeah
basically I am going to show you how to
use all the colors and where they go
what they're meant for and show you how
to perfect your base this palette came
out yesterday so you can get your hands
on it now I will leave the link to all
the products that I use but especially
obviously the palette in the description
bar down below as you can see this
palette is like literally pocket-sized
and it contains all the colors you would
need the neutralize or perfect any kind
of skin issue that you're facing I know
for me it's mainly redness but like I
said I go through every color in this
video and it show you where to put it
and what they are useful so I really
hope you enjoy so if you want to learn
how to get this skin then please keep
watching
okay so starting off with a completely
bare face I think it works best to apply
the concealers underneath your
foundation just so this way you can see
all the kind of areas that would need
color correcting in their clearest form
that makes sense you've not got anything
on top so you want to go ahead and prep
and prime your skin as you normally
would and then I'm going to show you the
palette and kind of take you through
step by steps where I would apply each
color on my face and then apply the rest
of my skin makeup so here's the palette
as you can see and I would have showed
you before obviously super pocket-sized
super small so kind of all the colors
you would need are all in one place so
perfect for traveling and saves you
having to buy like separate colors for
each part so to start off with on my
skin I'm going to go in with the green
shade so in order to hide kind of like
imperfections correctly you want to
neutralize the color that you're trying
to conceal so for instance red is the
color that is directly across from green
from the color wheel so taking the green
concealer I'm going to be applying this
on top of any redness it really helps to
get rid of any redness so it's really
good for spots and stuff like that I'm
going to take a little brush and pick up
from the green concealer it picks up a
lot of product straightaway all of these
colors are super super creamy so it
should last you a long time as well you
shouldn't find that you run out of this
lot because a little goes a long way so
for me I don't have a huge amount of
blemishes but I do have some on my chin
and I do find that I get really red here
like on the side of my nose so that's
where I'm going to be concentrating the
green concealer
and then like I said just on any little
rather blemishes that you might have
like so so the next color on the palette
is the purple shade this one's really
good for kind of neutralizing any
yellowness that makes sense so when I
say yellow that kind of implies in terms
of skin any kind of like dull complexion
so you want to apply this to any places
that you might have slightly darker not
necessary your dark under eyes but just
any places that you want to brighten and
kind of give a bit more life to your
skin so if you find that your skin all
over might be quite like sallow and dull
go ahead and apply it all over that's
right like sometimes and also like
tinted primers are good for color
correcting as well if you want a bit
more coverage then concealers are the
way to go this palette is perfect I'm
just taking it again on the brush and
for me I'm probably going to apply this
malls up here just cuz that's why I find
it kind of gets the most darkest and
want to give it a bit more life to my
skin and actually maybe a bit on my
mouth as well
so the next color is this pink shade and
this is perfect anyone wants to kind of
add radiance and get rid of any kind of
darker colored spots and that sort of
thing
but for me I'm kind of using this more
for the radiance tool so I'm gonna apply
this in the places that I want to kind
of like kind of like the powerful one
but kind of brighten up and add a bit
more light to my skin actually kind of
have a few darker spots more like down
the bridge of my nose into the woods at
the side of my skin and kind of see a
few here so I'm kind of kind of going to
press that on to get maximum coverage as
well like so obviously you don't always
have to apply every single color I'm
just demonstrating how to use this whole
palette and showing you how to get
maximum wear from it the next color is
the orange shade now this one is kind of
meant for more um darker to medium skin
tones as the orange and the yellow kind
of do the same thing but obviously it
would depend on your skin tone which one
you use
I'm truely's both because I'm just going
to show you how to use them both but
orange is perfect for neutralizing blue
you guys know I always say when I am
wear like orange tones on my eyes and
stuff it really makes the blue pop to
kind of live there next to each other
but orange on top of blue really helps
to cancel it out so this is what you
want to apply to kind of like good dark
circles or any sort of like I know maybe
if you had like bruising or anything
like that but this is really good for
dark circles underneath your eyes
as you can see they blend on super super
easy and they're kind of in a palette
that you would think is like a thick
concealer formula but they go on really
really creamy so you know they're going
to blend really nice into the skin
without leaving too much product and
feeling like you're wearing a lot of
makeup because this looks like you've
got so much on your face but it's really
a thin amount and it's doing a lot it's
really pigmented I also finally get
quite blue here I don't know if anyone
else does kind of like in that inner
corner so this color is perfect for that
and you could use this on your eyelids
as well if you find that you get quite
dark pigmented eyelids I know quite a
few people have that issue so like I
said the next color in the palette is
this yellow one and this one is really
good for neutralizing like purple
undertones and stuff it's really good
for getting rid of any veins or again
like dark circles for me I actually take
the yellow one onto my eyelid because
that's where I get the most veins and
kind of it's like the darkest areas for
me as you can see I have quite veiny any
eyelids like a flower but also I'm going
to go ahead and put this on top of the
orange to give it a bit of extra
brightness as well and actually my nose
is a few veins so
and then finally the blue shade is
really good like the orange one or
interim is good for cancelling out blue
blue is good for cancelling out orange
so you're probably thinking like what's
orange on your skin but for people that
might want to conceal freckles or
anything like that
or might have like hyperpigmentation the
blue shade is ideal for doing that
so once you've applied the kind of
colors that you want to use obviously
you don't have to use every single color
every single time I just applied them
all the purposes of demonstration just
kind of showing you what color goes
where and kind of obviously describing
to you as well where the colors would go
but like I said once you've applied or
the concealer that you want to I would
go ahead and blend it in with a damp
sponge to absorb any excess product and
really press it into the skin you don't
want to kind of use buffing motions
right back so you're going to take it
away from whatever you just applied so I
would go ahead and blend it with a
sponge so as you can see there's already
like a massive difference in terms of
brightness on my skin I know obviously
it's brightness in the sense that all
the colors will quite pale but you can
see there's a like you can't really see
any blemishes or any darkness underneath
my eyes or anything like that
and I haven't even put foundation or
like my regular concealer on already so
this is why color correcting is actually
such an important step if you're really
wanting to achieve that flawless base
and kind of look airbrushed and all that
jazz a lot of it is underneath your
foundation that like really makes a
difference so that's all the concealers
blended into my skin as you can see my
skin appears a lot more bright and a lot
more radiant which is kind of the whole
purpose of that palette and I really
don't feel like I'm wearing a huge
amount of makeup I can still see pits of
my skin through it the concealers are
not too thick at all obviously if you
apply layers and layers and layers
they're going to be thick but they are
super pigmented in color but they're not
too thick so you need minimal amount to
do a maximum amount you that make sense
a little goes a long way with these so
yeah I definitely recommend if you
struggle with any kind of blemishes or
color correcting or there's just
something missing in your base and you
want to achieve
that flawless finish tryout
color-correcting don't spend like 30
pounds on a single concealer when you
can get it all in a mini palette and i
think these are only $7.99 if you're
from the UK and it's 1099 you're from
America but I will leave it linked down
below yeah once you've applied your
concealers and all of that you want to
go ahead and apply your foundation on
the top and again don't buff it in
because you'll move even though you've
pressed it into your skin you can still
move around the concealer so I would use
either the same sponge or more like a
dabbing dabbing motion on your skin to
apply your foundation on the top so I'm
going to go ahead and do that now and
then we will continue with the rest of
the face
so this is just foundation applied on
the top and as you can see for me
personally I feel a lot more like
brighter underneath my eyes and
everything just feels a lot more
flawless and a lot more even in color I
don't find that there's an areas that
are dark than others I feel like I've
really managed to infect my base if that
makes sense so going ahead still I'm
going to continue with cream products
because I'm not yet finished just
because my foundations applied I still
see one a bit of like contour and
concealer I'm going to use the sleek
cream contour kit in medium you guys
have seen me use this before and you
guys know I love it a lot if you want to
know how to highlight and contour as
well using this I do have a video on it
and I can leave that in the link down
below as well yeah I'm just going to
apply this where I normally would for
contour and highlighting so kind of a
bronze and finish up and perfect my skin
I find because of the color correcting
eyes I need to apply a kind of less
concealer because the underneath has
done a lot for me so as a result of
color correcting you almost need to
apply less face makeup that makes sense
to that's always a bonus be and go ahead
and blend this all in again
you
but once you've applied all the creams
to your face you want to go ahead and
set them all in place in powder so I'm
going to take the sleek luminous pressed
powder and just dust that all over my
face I'm feeling like having quite dewy
luminous skin today so I'm going to take
the sleek face Wilma contouring and
blush palette in the shade medium and
I'm going to take this shimmery bronzer
and use that as a bronzer put blusher
I'm taking my favorite brush from seek
you guys know this this is in the color
rose gold and just a dusting this on the
apples of my cheeks and to finish off
this skin makeup I'm going to go ahead
and you take the sleek highlighting
palette in a precious metals and take
the powder color just here and apply
that to the other place but I want to
highlight which is essentially
everywhere
I'm just gonna go ahead and applied my
scar and then I will be back to apply a
lip option so once you've gone ahead and
done that I'm just going to apply a lip
like I said and this is one of the lip
plumping crayons yeah you heard me from
sleek in notorious nude so basically a
nude crayon that's going to plump your
lips rather than a gloss so first I've
ever heard of these so if you like
things that plump your lips and they've
got a few colors to choose from as well
and this then you'd love this so I'll
leave it all linked down below so kept
everything super minimal as this is the
finished makeup look I just kind of
wanted this to be a skin focus video and
mainly show you how to use obviously the
color correcting palette from sleek I
really hope you guys enjoyed these
