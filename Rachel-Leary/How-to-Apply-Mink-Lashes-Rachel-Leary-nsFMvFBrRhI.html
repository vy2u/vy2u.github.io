today I'm filming a highly requested
video and I asked if you guys wanted to
see this and loads of you said yes as
you can tell by the title is how to
apply mink lashes tutorial so in this
video I'm going to show you the tips and
tricks I take to make things one a lot
more comfortable for myself too a lot
more easier for myself and three just my
general tips on application so I'm gonna
take you step by step from even how to
take them out the packet because
sometimes that is one of the most
difficult parts to cutting applying the
glue all that good stuff the lashes I am
using are from velu and I do have a
discount code and I will leave it down
below if you guys want to get your hands
on these ones as well or the glue or
anything that I use in the video use the
code to get some up money off yeah if
you guys want to see how to apply mink
lashes then keep on watching
okay so to start off with I think
actually something that's quite
difficult can be actually getting the
lashes out of the packaging because as
you know mink lashes are really more
delicate then like the ones that you get
from all the ones that aren't made of
like actual hair so you have to be
really delicate with these because the
hair can be really easy to fall out so
the way I like to do it is open the
packet the ones that I've decided to use
are the winging style from valor they're
one of my all-time favorites so it comes
like this and this string here helps you
obviously to get this bit of plastic out
which I would recommend doing and then a
lot of people I find let me get rid of
box a lot of people are you have to
ignore my two broken nails okay we're
over it a lot of people I think try and
like pick at this bit with that thing
isn't try and peel it off
I found a more effective way to be using
tweezers so these tweezers are just I
think these were just from boots or
something like that so what I like to do
is a bend the plastic like so so this
doesn't damage the lashes at all that
obviously on a really flexible band so
this makes it a bit easier for me to use
the tweezers and tip it and peel it off
like that then that's the other now on
to trimming your lashes so this is my
eye makeup and I currently don't have
any mascara on because with a brand new
pair of lashes what I like to do is
normally normally they are too long for
my eye I already know that I'm going to
be chopping off this tiny bit here and
this tiny bit here and then it's just a
matter of fact of whether or not I need
to chop off any of the actual lashes so
what I like to do is just sit the lash
on my eye and place the shortest end
exactly where I would want it to sit on
my eye and then I know if I need to cut
any more off that's coming from this
side so I just pop the lashes on I want
them to look
and I can tell they're just a tiny bit
too long on their side so I'm going to
cut off this segment here because that
bit was just hanging off my eye so
taking some little scissors these are
from hobby craft I thought they were so
cute just taking the lash so like I said
I already knew that that bit was coming
off and now I know that I just need to
chop off one of the segments so like
that and then just chopping off there's
tiny little bit in it in a corner there
like that and I'm going to do the same
with the other one as well and then I'll
get onto application so now what I'm
going to do is just apply a light coat
of mascara I don't use my favorite
mascara which is as you guys probably
know by now the Mac extended play just
because the formula this one's really
dry and doesn't will not really dry but
it's not as moosie as some other
mascaras and I find it just applies the
perfect amount without really really
coating my lashes and I feel when you're
applying false lashes you really don't
want a ton of mascara underneath because
that's when it starts to look really
noticeable so I'm just applying mascara
first with mink lashes I probably
wouldn't recommend applying them
afterwards because you want to preserve
them as long as possible and mascara can
kind of not damage them but ruin them
slightly so I'm just applying like a
mascara to my top lashes so after doing
that it is time for application and I
think this is what most people struggle
with especially with a brand new a pair
of lashes so the to lash glues I have
they are both by valor they are in white
and black for this one I am going to use
white just so you can really see what
I'm doing but the black one is amazing
especially with I looks like this way
you've got quite a thick line on being
really subtle especially if you're in a
rush in you don't have time if your lash
glue to dry before you leave the house
black is really good in terms of like I
said it being really subtle and
unnoticeable but obviously as you know
white dries clear you can use any one
you want
um but this one I found to be amazing
and it's got a little flat applicator
which makes applying the product
on the lashes so much easier so what I
like to do is take my lash like this the
glue works by twisting and it just
applies a bit like that and then onto
the lash just lightly coat it like so so
just a thin amount like this and the key
especially with brand new lashes is
patience
I'm now going to wait about 40 or so
seconds so the glue has a chance to get
tacky this will make things so so so
much easier for yourself when it comes
to applying the lashes if you were to
apply it straight away like this you'd
find the lash slipping and sliding about
on your eye and that just makes it a
hundred times more difficult for
yourself so I'm going to wait about
another 30 seconds for actually applying
it onto my eye so now on to application
what I like to do is take the lash and
take a pair of tweezers and just grasp
them in the middle like that after
you've let the glue dry for 40 seconds
to a minute placing it down in the
center then dragging it down on the
outside and then dragging it down on the
inside also another tip so obviously
this glue is completely dried on this
side now just taking your fingers and
just clamping your lashes and the fake
lashes together just like that just
ensures that they're really really kind
of glued glitz glues down and they're
going to be staying on because you don't
want flapping lashes about so that just
really helps to insure that they stayed
together because mascara is actually
quite sticky so it does act as a bit of
an adhesive if you really press it down
together so it really helps then what to
stay and last as long but I find this
going to be incredible anyway so I never
really have that issue but yeah just the
tip if you find that they hang off maybe
slips after a few hours that would
helps just really pressing the lash and
your lashes together so this is what
they should look like once the eye has
dried I find that to be the easiest
technique honestly practice practice
practice when it comes to lashes having
these lashes that have a firmer lash
band to me make things a lot easier in
terms of you can be kind of quite firm
with your tweezers when dragging them
down and stuff like that and with more
flimsy ones that's when they can tend to
move about but then like I said the key
for that is just let the glue dry for
ages right not like an hour or so but
literally 40 seconds to a minute so it
gets really tacky placing it down in the
center of the lash and then dragging it
down either side it makes things so much
easier I've watched my friends do it and
I watch them stop from here and then try
and drag it down and that's when things
start to move and they get complicated
so honesty work from the center and then
work in and out because once you put it
in the center you can you do have a bit
of freedom like if you realize you need
to kind of drag it down that way
slightly bit more it'll move and then
you can drag it down there do some pair
of tweezers as well and that just makes
things so so so much easier for yourself
so that is it for this video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and learned
something new I know it was quite quick
but I feel like people think lashes can
be a lot more difficult than it really
is to apply so these are just the ways
that I like to apply them and the
quickest method and I know mink lashes
can be quite scary for some people just
because the lash bands look thick then
they're kind of like synthetic lashes
that you can get so people think that
they're a lot more difficult to wear and
a lot less comfortable so the ways I've
hopefully the ways that I've shown you
how to do it make things look easy for
you and you guys give them a try for
lower lashes I know a lot of people get
a bit funny about make lashes in terms
of Cruelty to Animals and stuff like
that if you go onto their website and
you read all about it you will see that
the new lashes so animals are harmed or
anything like that otherwise I wouldn't
wear them as you guys know I have a
discount code with volute so if you guys
wanted to try these lashes or any of the
any of that other lashes these ones are
my fav as well as what the Fleur
and their car the Carly lash the teat or
any ones that have a wing I'm in love
with you guys have to try them and like
I said you can use my code Rachael
narrate for money off so I will leave
all that information in the description
bar below definitely recommend getting a
glue as well if you're looking for a
decent lash glue especially if you find
that something that you struggle with
because I used to use the one where you
squeeze out the tube and I'd find that
the glue and just go everywhere and I've
wasted the whole tube and it smells as
well so the kind of applicator on that
one is so easy especially for beginners
if you're just trying to try out it
doesn't let you apply too much product
as well yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and learned some tips and
makes it a lot easier for you to apply
lashes so give this video a thumbs up if
