today I've teamed up with a sleek makeup
to bring you a tutorial on kind of how
to cream a contour featuring their brand
new at cream contour kit which I am so
so so excited about honestly I've had it
for like a month or so now and it's
honestly one of the best kind of cream
contour kits I've used it comes in three
colors in this video I'm going to be
using the lightest one as you can see
I've thoroughly used it each palette
comes with six colors ranging from light
to dark
this is shade one two three four five
and six obviously in the tutorial I'll
be showing you how to use them with this
one as well
they are so creamy and pigmented and
super easy to blend like I said it comes
in two other colors as well as the light
one this is the shade medium so again
shade one two three four five six I
could probably get away with using this
one as well for a reference I'm about a
medium skin tone and I'm tan so like I
said I could probably get away with
using this one as well and it also comes
in the shade dark which looks like this
so they have a cream contour kit for
everyone so everyone should be able to
get that kind of highlighted and
contoured look I think they're coming
out with them this week if not already
so I will make sure to leave all the
information it's down below so if you've
always wanted to learn how to cream
contour then stay tuned because I'll
give you some tips and tricks throughout
this video and kind of show you how to
use each color where to place them and
yeah so if you like the look of my skin
now then please keep watching so
starting off with my base already
applied and my eyebrows done like I
normally would I'm then going to go in
with the sleek contour kit in the shade
light so this is when I'm going to start
the kind of highlighting process I'm
going to take the shade one which is
this one here it's a brilliant light
banana shade so it's perfect for
brightening up the areas that you want
to kind of like bring forward and hard
which is typically like your under-eyes
so I'm going to be applying this like I
said just in my under-eye with a flat
brush so typically you kind of keep it
in like an upside down triangle motion
and these kind of yellow tones really
really helped to kind of like I said
brighten cover up any dark circles and I
find using creams so much easier to
achieve that they look a lot more
natural then I'm just going to blend
that in with my sponge
yes right under eyes come to bro
then I'm going to take shade 6 which is
the darkest color and I'm going to use
this to carve out my cheekbones I'm
going to take a rounded brush to do this
and what you want to do is take it from
kind of at the top of your ear and kind
of towards the corner of your mouth but
I wouldn't go any past kind of like your
eye area here like so what's good about
this is that this palette is actually
really quite cool toned which is what
you want when you're contouring I'll I
have a lot of kind of cream contour kits
that are quite warm and you want it to
be cool because that's what mimics the
shadow like that I'm not going to blend
that out yet just because I'm going to
use one of the other colors to blend out
a bit later now to continue to contour I
can take shade 5 which is just this one
here and this is the one that I'm going
to apply to like my forehead area just
because I don't really feel like I need
to slim down my forehead any further if
you do or that's what if you want to
achieve a smaller forehead then I'm
stick with the shade 6 but using the
shade 5 it's still dark like it's going
to do a bit of contouring but it's more
just to kind of warm up and connect it
all together so I'm just going to take a
duo fiber brush for this and like I said
just kind of use this along the kind of
tops of my forehead and bring it down
just add a tiny bit of warmth kind of
connect it down
like so then just for a tiny bit of nose
contour I've never really contour my
nose but with this one it comes with so
many colors I think you can get kind of
quite a subtle contour with it I'm going
to take the shade four which is this one
here which is pretty close to my natural
skin tone and I'm going to use this just
to kind of like I said contour my nose
slightly so what you want to do is draw
lines like that then kind of blend it
down slightly as you can see super
subtle that's kind of what I like about
this palette and also what I like about
using creams everything is just so much
easily blended and looks so much more
kind of natural and subtle with powders
it can look quite kind of cakey like
that
now time to blend out the contour I'm
going to use a shade three and I think
I'm going to mix a bit of shade for for
it just to kind of blend everything
together and make that bit be the
darkest bit but then it's still blending
and connecting together the shades that
we used up here shade three is also
quite light so it's going to act as like
a natural highlight as well
I find you have fiber brushes like the
easiest to blend creams out with just
because they don't let you apply too
much product and they give you like a
flawless finish like there's no kind of
brush marks left on the skin too
then finally to highlight down the
center of my skin I'm going to take
shade - which is this one here and I'm
going to take that one up my forehead
and down the bridge of my nose to kind
of enhance the nose contour and then on
my chin as well
I'm also going to take a tiny bit that
shade too and just place it underneath
my contour as well and that's just going
to make sure it's super sharp
as you can see super easy super
blendable I'm so impressed with this
palette especially the fact that you can
get it from your local suits or super
drug it's incredible I feel like there's
such a hype over Korean contouring and
contouring in general at the moment but
it's all kind of been like high-end
brands so I'm so so so impressed I
really hope you guys kind of found it
interesting sometimes
I never know what to do with each color
because there's six-month inking how the
hell am I meant to use it six colors on
my face so I hope you guys found this
tutorial super interesting the palette
does come with a little information
guide and tips and tricks on how to
contour as well which is super super
helpful if you don't know how especially
if you're a visual learner like me it
comes with a little face and it kind of
tells you where to apply each color
which is so handy now I'm going to go
ahead and finish off the rest of my face
I'm going to set my under eye with the
sleek luminous pressed powder in the
shade zero one so a light powder I'm
also going to set use this a kind of
everywhere that we highlighted to again
set it all in place and bring it forward
after using creams you do want to make
sure that you set everything in place
just because you don't want anything to
crease you don't want anything to move
you just want everything to kind of like
last as long as it possibly can then
it's settled the contouring and bronzer
bronzer ring the contouring and praise
I'm at taking this palette from sleek it
is their contouring and blush palette in
the shade medium and I'm going to take
this one here just to add a bit of
warmth into my skin
then for a bit of a blusher I am at
taking this blush from sleek in the
shade rose gold which is like such an
affordable dupe for the NARS is it
orgasm or deep throat blush or something
like that so if you've always wanted to
try that one try this on burst
then finally to highlight you guys know
I'm obsessed with this palette it is
there if the sleek Solstice palette and
I'm just going to take this color here
and apply it to the tops of my
cheekbones the end of my nose and like
my Cupid's bow Oh
so that is my finished face after using
it the secret cream contour kit to kind
of add a bit more definition and
dimension kind of back into my skin I
