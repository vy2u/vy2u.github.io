today I thought I would do a video on
how to do liquid eyeliner I use a
combination of liquid and gel kind of
day today in most of my videos you will
see me use liquid but I do like to use a
gel and I think in this tutorial I plan
to use a gel just because I have special
techniques under like easy ways to apply
it which I feel would be helpful but
obviously do whatever suits you I hope I
explained things well enough if not just
leave comments down below but I'm sure
I'll say something about that at the end
but yeah I hope you enjoyed this video
and learned something and yeah let's get
started so I've started off with my
eyebrows done and I've also prepped my
eyes and just highlighted my inner
corner and brow bone but I'm gonna go
ahead and do my eye makeup like I would
normally do before doing a winged liner
and then I will talk you through
step-by-step okay so as a lot of you
know I like to be a super messy and
applying my eyeshadow because I always
go in with a wipe to give it a really
clean edge and what this is going to do
is give you something to kind of base
your eyeliner on and that is another tip
that I find to be really helpful so I'm
just gonna take my wipe and kind of draw
a line in the bottom of my eyelid and
kind of towards the end of where my brow
finishes like that
so that way when you're like applying
your eyeshadow you can just be as messy
as you want and you don't have to worry
about like it being perfect straight
away and I always always always do my
eyes before my foundation especially for
this technique just so I'm not wiping
off any of my foundation anyway but
today I'm just just going for a plain
matte brown smokey eye which I do plan
to further deepen up so if you like the
end result by the end of the video and
you want to see a tutorial on this eye
look then just let me know in the
comments below so let's just get on to
the eyeliner so when doing my eyeliner I
either like to use a liquid or a gel
today I'm probably gonna use either just
a gel or maybe I'm gonna use a tiny bit
of liquid just to kind of clean it up
afterwards but I will be demonstrating
it with a gel so this is the Sigma
wicked gel eyeliner what I like to do is
take this either a Mac - I think the
smallest one is the 208 or it's a 210 or
something like that either that brush or
for this purpose I'm using the Dell iam
tools seven six zero so if I just clean
it because I just took my other eye it
looks like that so it's got the tiniest
little angle so I'm gonna get really
precise movements with it and what I
like to do is take the gel eyeliner and
put it on my hand first so what this is
gonna do is really warm it up and make
it a lot easier to apply sometimes I
find with some chela's they can be quite
dry and applying it straight from the
pot makes it really difficult when
applying it to your eye so I always like
to warm up on the back of my hand and
then obviously just clean it off with
some eye makeup remover at the end to
start off I'm gonna trace the bottom of
the wing along the line that we created
and I never ever closed my eyes when I
do my eyeliner they're always always
open I always just move the angle of my
head as you'll soon see
so in slow movements just following the
base the line that we created and then
drag it back in
and then extending it upwards if you
want to another perk of doing your eyes
first before your foundation is that you
can always go back in and clean up the
mistake that you've also made maybe on
your eyeliner as well as eyeshadow and
stuff like that so I'll close our eyes
slightly to fill it in right always just
draw my line towards the center of my
eyelid and then I'll work on the way
across this just gives me a base point
it's like when I close it and it looks
like that but when I open it and it
looks good I'll sort it out afterwards
because the most important thing is how
it looks when your eye is like open
always always always just use small
small brush strokes rather than just one
long line and then you're like it
got it all wrong just really slow and
patient if you want it to look the best
that it can it's now I'll kind of shut
my eyes slightly to tidy up and now
extending it across then always making
sure to keep your eye open to just keep
checking that it looks right so you
don't get carried away and then you open
your eye and it doesn't doesn't look
anything like how you like it too so I
deliberately just got a bit messy there
so I can tidy it up afterwards and get
the precision I want but that's the kind
of effect you should get
so I said now just going back in again
with the wipe just so I can get that
really clean cut edge see you can go in
with like liquid liner or you can apply
this this same technique to using just a
liquid liner not a gel so my key tips
for just applying your eyeliner would be
really help yourself you really struggle
getting that straight line either put
tape down or when you do your eye shadow
like I did just give yourself that
straight line so you have got something
to work with a lot of eyeliner tutorials
I see they just kind of go straight in
because they can get that straight line
perfect every time and I feel like
that's a bit it's like making
assumptions that everyone else can do
that I know from experience that that
was one of the main things that I
struggled with was getting that straight
line and just having that perfect wing
so find a method that you find easy
whether it's using tape or the same way
I did and just keep practicing and work
from there I always like to start with
the wing because that way if the wing
goes right you can just wipe off you're
not going to ruin the whole of your eye
makeup and I find that that's easier to
just kind of connect in and then work in
them in over your eye rather than
working the inner and then going out to
the wing I find it just easier to do the
wing first but obviously it is personal
preferences and obviously I'm not
perfect I didn't get my winged eyeliner
perfect all the time I've had days where
it's taking me like an hour just cuz I
can't get it right but just keep
practicing and you'll get that and let's
stop rambling now and actually do my
makeup now and I'll talk you in a sec so
this is the finished eye makeup with the
liner
this is the finish meter so that was the
finished tutorial I hope you guys have
found it helpful um I know personally
I'm not very good at explaining things

suggestions or as in on suggestions how
to do eyeliner and like other eyeliner

hardest to get back to you just because

will try and get back to you but let me
