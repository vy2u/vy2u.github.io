not said a word yeah sorry hey
guys welcome back to my channel so today
we have got some new makeup which I'm so
excited about this is just browsing
online on a beautybay they had this sale
way it was like spending this much get
this much off they spend over a certain
amount and you get a big discount I
thought oh my god
when was the last time I actually like
bought some new makeup I really wanted
to try so that is what I did so
everything is actually from a beauty
base so this video is kind of like a
one-stop shop I've left everything in
links down below because I do believe it
is all still in stock I kind of focused
on getting like some glittery eyeliners
new foundation highlighters some lip
stuff nude lip stuff so if you're like
me you love a good cop renewed glam in
all aspects of your lips and eyes then
this haul is gonna be it for you but

watchtower and this week it goes to

notification bell always on thank you so
much - so it means so much to me reading
through all of your comments and love
and support always means so so so much
to me it doesn't go unnoticed so thank
you so much but anyway without further
ado I feel like let's crack on with the
whole
so I have got my big box of gear Dee's
hair I think I got about 10 things I'm
not sure so we'll see how fast we can
get through these I've got a few things
from a few of the same brands I'm going
to be swatching them all for you this is
kind of my first time looking at them so
let's see so the first thing I got is
another one of the glitter and glow
eyeshadows do you remember me saying
that I had this mini one that was called
a kitten karma and I didn't know whether
or not if it was the same size or the
same color as the one called kitten so I
thought it let's get kitten said
that is the one that I got so I'm gonna
swatch it for you it looks like a really
gorgeous kind of like it looks like a
really gorgeous like light pinky Goldie
everyday yeah oh my god that's gonna be
right on the eyelids and just see that
they're just like a really gorgeous
every day pinky rose gold each champagne
color I always a bang on about how much
I love these I think they are so quick
just to swipe over the eye give a pretty
like effortless glittery you spent a lot
of time on your eye makeup look just a
couple of crease colors wipe that on
lashes bang I'm out the door
speaking of a stealer they do have
another range of this kind of glitter
and glow shadows but this one is more of
the shimmer and glow so it's not so much
the glittery pigment it's not super
shimmery it's more just like a liquid
eye shadow with a metallic finish I have
the shade of this already in Jezebel
which is very similar to that kitten
color but more of like a liquid rose
gold version this is in the color twig
and it kind of looked like a a super
dark kind of coppery chocolaty color
which is exactly what it is cuz I'm as
you can see at the moment I'm really
into just kind of like dark matte smoky
rounded eye looks but I thought this
would maybe just add more like a base to
a dark matte shadow you can see it looks
like that it's like a dark brown with a
reflex of like a warm copper running
through it I feel like I'd love this for
more on night outs and evenings when I
kind of want a more darker sultry smoky
eye today are
the two things I got from Steeler but
that's not it but kind of like
by-products the next three things that I
got are all the glitter eyeliners the
first one is from opiate the metal and
liquid glitter this is in the color give
me blue and oh my god oh my god this is
just me in a glitter let me just do a
close-up look at that it is literally
copper goals now what I love it using
glitter eyeliners for is maybe if I've
got like a shimmery shadow look going on
nothing with any added gift I kind of
used this to just kind of like pain on
the glitter that I really won like the
color and this color is just a bit of me
let me do a few swatches and kind of
show you what I mean I mean obviously
you could use this as like this line if
you like doing that glitter cut creases
or anything like that but for me
personally I would put this all over on
top of a maybe satin eyeshadow or maybe
a matte shadowed look I was going just
to add that extra sparkle so I don't
know you're picking up how like a
glittery that is but literally just
opening that now has made me all tingly
inside does anyone else get like that
over makeup when they open it and you're
just like so I literally cannot wait to
apply that to like everywhere and then
the next two glitters line is that I've
got I can't remember the colors I got in
these are from la girl la splash is that
not the same as I'm a girl well I
remember these being super affordable
anyway and it's called the wickedly
divine a smudge proof eyeliner this
one's in the color gobbler or the shade
cobbler and this one is in the shade
meal
oh very like LaBute on knives but I got
one again to kind of go more all over my
lid and then I got one to kind of imply
and like my inner corner maybe if the
eyeshadow that you apply on your inner
corner I don't know if any of you else
get this but it's not like staying where
it's not as like glittery as I want it
to be I thought this would be a nice
color just to kind of add a pop of
sparkle so this one's the color gobbler
let me swatch on me hand
oh yeah just a nice like champagne gold
again this would work all over the eye
as well and just kind of like pictured
it in my inner corner and then this one
is in the color meal as definitely oh
it's like kind of an in-between shade
between that really intensely couple and
I got and the gold shade that I just got
and love how glittery these are yes okay
let me zoom you in zoom
never zoomed away from the chakras okay
so that was the OPP one that was the
meal shade and that was the goblet shade
so as you can see just kind of glitter
iron as you can use them for ever you
want I kind of plan to put these all
over my lid because that's why I used to
do it with the Urban Decay a Midnight
Cowboy one and I just loved the effect
that it gave on top of my eyes but I
never had the right colors so I just
made sure to it stock up on me little
liners and I must say I love it
my sorry I should probably stop swearing
okay no was wearing okay so the next two
products that I got art for the face the
first one I got is the la girl pro
coverage HD today High Definition long
wear illuminating foundation so it's
basically said pro coverage full
coverage HD high definition wear long
wear and eliminating that's like
everything I look for in a foundation I
have actually it tried this foundation
before but the color that I got I
thought was the hours are I'll get one
because that literally sounds like my
perfect formula or foundation I was like
right okay one that's kind of dark the
curves when I go out I like to look
really tan and dark so I'll get it in a
dark shade I got it in the shade tan
thinking like that's kind of the shade
that I normally would get but it might
be normally a little bit dark for me but
like it's normally called that color
their version of tan was literally like
and like the thing is I can make it work
but I just have to be extremely
bronze which isn't always so I don't
always get to reach for it so much so
I've got this one in the color soft
honey which is a few shades lighter I do
believe and it does actually come out on
the hand quite like yellowy orange
undertone and when I've got it I thought
fuck's sake I've got the wrong shade
again but when you rub it out I'll show
you you can see it just becomes a lot
more like yellowy and a lot more true to
color so yeah this was in the shade soft
honey what I love about that foundation
it's super buildable and yet it looks
incredible in pictures lasts a long time
on a night out and it's so affordable as
well as so the LA girl Pro coverage HD
high definition long wear illuminating
foundation I love you and this is like
like I said so affordable if you're in
the market for a new front if you're in
the market for a new foundation
definitely recommend this click the link
below have a little shop pop it in your
basket tell me what you think I don't
think you'll be disappointed and the
next oh no wait the other face product
I've been dying it to get my hands on
this like Nora Jory this is the artist
catcher jackie ina illuminator in lucky
so my friends call me peach so I kind of
had to pick this up for the sake of that
you're probably wondering why they call
me peach it's probably not what you're
thinking but it is a little bit of what
you're thinking but not only that it's
because like my name just kind of went
from Rachel - Rach - rachey - Chi Chi -
Cheech - peach I literally don't know
how that happened but it did and I'm not
complaining about it so me and peaches
we have like a connection anyway I've
seen her rave about this I've seen all
of her supporters rave about this I just
love the color as well I took off the
kind of plastic that keeps it all in tap
because I wanted to swatch it straight
away oh it is like the most gorgeous
gold with only really like a hint of
peach it's a proper just like warm gold
which I am that's like the one color I'm
missing in my highlighter collection I
feel like it's only
right that I apply this right now I mean
my heart is kind of like popping today
but I just need to pop a little bit more
sorry
you know you just kind of need to like
take a time out I'm just obsessed with
it like I knew I was gonna love it as
soon as I picked it up made sure I
picked it up they also sell the LeBrons
shade on that as well of your other more
darker complexion and you prefer
something a little bit more less less
intense is this shade but this one works
perfectly for me I will probably pick up
the LeBron shade just because I love a
sort of more shimmery bronze as well but
the artists Couture diamond powders
themselves are an insane formula you
guys know I always say my favorite way
to make your highlighter lip hop is to
wear a liquid one underneath and apply
one like this on top it really clings to
it and stands out and this is definitely
gonna be my newest bow to loose powder
highlight i'm obsessed the shade of it
get it and the last two kind of makeup
related things are lips I'll start with
this one it's kind of a less interesting
one just a little but I just I realized
I'm on my nude lip pencil sitting right
at the moment they're just a little bit
to her cool and the darks I wanted to
pick one up that was a bit more lighter
but still really really natural maybe
that I could even fill my whole lip in
with and this is the LA girl perfect
precision at lip liner in the shade
flesh so let me just swatch it for you
on my hand really creamy formula it's
just this sort of shade here so you can
see a lot warmer a lot kind of more
natural I feel like the perfect shade to
be kind of like over lining your lips
with and it look really subtle I'm
obsessed with this already I can feel it
this is probably gonna go straight into
my makeup bag super affordable as well
so if I fell in love with this pencil I
wouldn't feel bad to always keep
repurchasing it and be buying it as it's
not gonna be breaking the bank so thank
you now this I am so excited for it's
quite new I think I saw it in loads of
the big US bloggers press trip snaps and
adjusting those people receiving it in
PR so I was like I really want to pick
this up is the news you a love pearl I'm
not really sure what it was basically
the little like actually one can we just
take
it's very like Gucci's slash and of
Louis Vuitton Fendi print vibes but you
open it up oh my god they did not come
up to play okay so basically you an come
out with these little like lip kit type
things
Wow so it came with a lip topper a lip
cream and a long wear creme lip liner
now this is a permanent one for sure
this is their funfetti long-wear lip
dropper I've never heard of their opal
long-wear lip cream and I didn't even
know they did long wear lip pencils so
this was the slightly more lighter nude
kind of set let me what let me swatch
these or for you I can get that pencil
out that'd be mint how the hell
kind of want to keep a little case
twinkly butt right case that's a swatch
this pencils this is in pink champagne
oh look shimmery oh my god case it's but
it's shimmery so I feel like I won't be
reaching for that so much but mainly if
I wanted it all over the lip and I'll
swatch the two so let me swatch this
little mini opal
lip cream oh my god it's so cute and
then the little funfetti lip topper Wow
oh my god love this the one thing I will
say about jus a lip products are they
smell in sane like delicious that is
those three there for you so that was
the pencil there's the lip cream and
there's the lip top you can see super
shimmery and nude right up my street I
love you a lip products so it was a
definite yes from me and via final
product that I picked up it's actually a
audio scrub from the brand
too-cool-for-school is there coconut
milky body scrub I love a good scrub at
the moment is I've been reaching for
these so much when it comes to taking
off my tan you know there's like a back
like scrubbers it's like a long stick
with like the brush in the end I find
literally lathering myself and a body
scrub and using one of them to like
scrub my whole body even it was just my
legs my
just say it really gets my tan off by
using circular motions as well I've come
to the end of my other scrub so I
thought I'd pick this one up I love
anything coconut and milky on my body
and I love the brand to call the school
I love their skincare I have they're
like coconut milk mists of this I kind
of can envision what the smell of this
is gonna be like but yeah I just picked
this up to replenish the one in my
shower I'll let you know how I get on
with this but coconut oil and everything
like that is so good for the body it's
so yeah I love coconut stuff in the
shower so if you're looking for a new
scrub always to get your turn off
