tutorial to trend going round at the
moment and as he didn't guess by the
intro I am following at my good pal
Jimmy and Genevieve

vlogger I love her sauce so much anyway
I asked you guys on a Twitter hip whose
tutorial you wanted to see me follow
along and pretty much all of you guys
said Jamie I don't know if that's
because you guys know that we're friends
or whatever or maybe it's part of her
beautiful Scottish accent which I do a
lot throughout this video because I love
it she knows I love it I did ask her
permission to do this video if there's
no tea no shade no pink lemonade but
before we start it is time before our
notification its shadow if you didn't
already know on this channel video
notification shout outs on every video

jazz XO which goes notification bail on
longtime subscriber love you girl I love
you too loss so yes if you want to see
me a follow along to add Jenny and
Genevieve makeup tutorial have some fun
with a Scottish accent with me hit that
thumbs up button
unless gone
I think let's go ahead and get started
with the tutorial I'm following along to
Jamie's night out get ready with me just
a little tip if you are actually
watching this for a night out get ready
with me I'll do a little count along get
some like alcohol going do a shot every
time she says I'm so tanned
okay we are back I've curled and kind of
slicked back my hair like the way a
friend it has unfortunately I did my own
but all I did was cut my hair with like
a wide barreled curling iron which I
used in my previous video which I'll
link here and then just brushed it back
hair sprayed it pretty simple I've just
got my hair done I took you with me we
went to Jasmine she just flipped me and
gave me a little curl I think it looks
pretty similar mine here my skin I'm
going to use the Charlotte Tilbury
wonderful love it
okay so I actually have this this is
deep like Jamie said the Charlotte
Tilbury a wonder go I've never actually
used this before so I'm gonna see like
how she applies us and obviously if you
haven't noticed I am the most turn
person ever
I use my turbo time from Newton and to
and a LinkedIn boom below and I just did
it this morning okay and I got she's
using the bigger version of this I
somehow had the travel sized version of
this I think she might have had a little
travel size kit once of all her as in
Charlotte Tilbury of all her go to
products that I got in a PR package but
if you can't get the travel size might
be worth trying out for you buy it but
it makes your skin look really nice and
radiant it doesn't feel too like sticky
which is what I kind of like in a primer
but if my skin is gonna look anything
like Jimmy's then I'll go there and I
had to get from deshay to come at me
because I am really tired so
is the hourglass vanish stick and the
Sheep golden in they'll do it's gonna be
like me but we're gonna crush some nice
by the way
that much because it doesn't suit me
when I'm peel and it's apparently
getting into the spring months and I'm
not keeping this Tanner
Lane listen we'll see what happens
magic complexion let's use the show it's
nobody magic complexion brush okay and
we're now gonna use a fluffy brush to do
so I don't have the color golden but I
do have the color golden tan and sand
and they feel like mixing them together
is gonna create a very similar shade
like I said if you've never tried this
foundation stick before it is so good I
know quite a few brands are coming out
with foundation sticks at the moment so
get on it okay and because I am also
quite tan I'm gonna add a Coppola sweat
to a slightly darker shade girl and
she's using like a fluffy a foundation
brush so I'm just gonna go in with a
fluffy foundation brush this one is from
Tom Ford has the Charlotte Tilbury so
I'm kind of trying to match the business
that's a good color so the color of use
is golden so it's funny when I usually I
just saw a little bit my pyramid
stop whining messed miss miss I'm gonna
use fixed that's what I'm doing here
this is shading okay okay quick blend
blend we're already on concealer hurry
oh okay I think that color is looking
pretty good so now it's concealer you
use the color medium a my yeah cuz I
want to keep okay the time you know I
don't have to be far too ashy under my
eyes and like I said I get ready like
rapid fire and we're not quite a lot of
that I'm going out tonight I really let
me come all the time here
I never add it here so maybe this is why
she looks so chiseled and snatched all
at the time more is more
oh I dunno something we're a little bit
more okay with a single shoot so perfect
I love this concealer I've already put a
little bit of shape tape over my eyelids
and say set and I've got my brains
already it's real I'm using the company
religion to the roads to be that of the
essence
okay let's blend this Beach is prepared
I quite like using this brush kind of
for everything and the combination of
that vanish stick and the concealer is
giving me coverage man of Rome accent
I'm feeling like yeah this I'm ready to
go out there like she said she's already
done her eyebrows and set her eyes and
stuff like that song I'm gonna go ahead
and do that now to catch up not being
funny I tried to do my brows kind of as
Jamie asked the end of the pressure of
meeting her in person she does and is
blessed with naturally full brows unlike
one but I am loving this she's gonna be
me brow inspiration from now on God now
I'm gonna go in with the Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish Pedro
and I use the shade medium which should
be perfect actually for me to do and I'm
gonna set under my eyes in the same
my make spinach engine in my forehead
okay I don't have that Charlotte Toby
powder I feel like I did once upon a
time and I just didn't reach for it for
ages so I just don't use it so I'm using
the NYX and no filter powder instead
this is in the color honey beige so she
said under her eye area chinny-chin-chin
around her nose and I would use my
grandmother's powder but I don't use too
much Peter when I'm gone out no regrets
go straight into the runs and I'm gonna
use my good ol favorite Mac dark tan and
it's the mineralized skinfinish okay I
don't have dark tan but I have dark you
guys know I rave about these bronzes
they're so good they're not even
bronzers but they're just they're just
like dog face powders which if you are a
larger color you can use this bronzers
fill me up these it's so so so nice I'm
ready to go to start to bronze up her
cheap ones and the cause I'm sweet on
that stuff looks perfect
and I'm just using it my Charlotte
pobedy powder and sculpt brush I'm using
one of a similar shape Mac 137 and I'm
going to do the usual around the jaw
line
I don't like it when I'm really kind of
mine later okay before we do that let's
keep bronzing this base is looking
pretty damn flawless right now I won't
lie I'm liking this selection of
products Jimmy well done all eight cat I
like it a lot okay time to contour love
country is old palette I did a tutorial
using this entire palette but my best
really dark contour shade here all right
up there through the back you know now
I'm gonna go back and okay so she used a
NYX contour kit I don't have that one I
do have this one and I'm gonna use the
kind of darker shade and she just kind
of applied it to the back of her
cheekbones she said she said depth at
the back actually again get at the back
there
is why she's so sculpted I am missing my
dark time and I'm gonna skip the no skip
was that skip scooped the nose oh okay
wait oh my god
skip in the nose does make a difference
I've no idea how I'm doing that right
I'm just kind of skipping the nose was
that I oh I look really Brown I'm not in
a good way let me just I just took my
powder brush is done and okay okay
whatever this is how I do my makeup I'll
actually just cause I always do my skin
first said the same thing to me there
are a couple pearl and just bless the
cheekbones
she's using quite a big brush doesn't
mean bit when his legs like paint off my
face and I came off this whole game you
already know that the 10-man nose is
coming back way to mark you could day
the bridge and then okay let's do this
oh you did quite a few layers and then
she said like a little exclamation mark
down the nose today I'm gonna use
whiskey
okay I don't have it risky by top but I
do have this this is a Nastasia Beverly
Hills blush kit this is the radiant
blush kit this is the color breeze and
it looks pretty damn similar so I'm just
gonna go ahead and use that and that is
like my perfect going out skin super
gooey babe okay so like she just said
we're gonna move on it to the eyes so
I'm gonna assume you in and yeah let's
do the ice
my milk I shot boys I love these I know
that they're not the easiest to get guys
wouldn't mother have done work on that
and homies let's see there for that one
one so for every I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take it could be color unseen you
can clearly see it okay I don't have it
that melt stack but I do have the morphe
35 2 palette and she set the color
unseen which to me it kind of looks like
this shade here so I'm gonna use that
one instead okay she holds it kind of
more like a pan so my Smith to be clear
brush to build that up series usual
using wonder-working movement obviously
this is the latest color that we'll be
using in the transition sheath of things
so it's really really easy to get a nice
and blue now you don't need to worry too
much about how much water to the oil and
all that and they're actually gonna go
underneath my eye with the same color
and the same you go you leave a mirror
and all thats gonna do is gonna stay
under the eye a little bit more and it's
a little bit darker than our eyes will
so it's just gonna smoke out underneath
the boat being too dark let me just
catch up
they're just windscreen wiper motions
super blown out you can tell why I
picked this look because I love this
gonna make up and then she says she's
the same a brush and runs it underneath
her eyes as well ow that really hurt but
we'll get over it
I prefer to use a slightly smaller brush
but we're going with her okay so now
she's moved on to color and she's using
the color
rust and so I'm just gonna take this
matte shade here from the morphe palette
as well under her eye a little bit just
do the Oakside
okay it's so going underneath the eye
with a smaller fluffy brush on just on
the out sides right
touching this in the crease and then I
think I'm actually gonna leave it like
that for the eyes do you know that
simple yeah I do you know that naive I'm
building up the crease bringing that
right and the corner I swap my brush
over and I'm using just a little history
brush a little bit smaller then I'm
going to walk back to my bigger brush
and go back into the transition shade
and then we're gonna bust that right out
okay so the placement of the product I
normally like to take it more onto the
lid because she's placed it quite quite
high so I'm gonna place it with the
brush all the way into the outer corner
just kind of in the hollows I think of
your eye and she holds her brush upwards
over you know I actually remember I
learned that type of Christy so did I
you know without I just stole it thank
you for the tips recipe see now that
makes me quite happy I liked how good he
may look and I thank the cause I'm sort
and it's quite nice to keep it this soft
and neutral a big lash of your name okay
so like she said just gonna keep it
pointing up and blend that out it is a
classic Jamie look I feel like this is
so a grungy effortless but yeah with a
big lash I feel like this was gonna look
pretty and I'm really liking this too
it's really making my eyes pop I feel
like that's what she did right okay
let's move on I'm gonna quickly under
this sheet blur and I'm just gonna put
that over my legs we spoke anything from
creasing and to blur the ocean Jimmy
you're so funny so cuz I don't have that
stuck from the same multi-planet I'm
just gonna take this shade here and just
use it to blow a tape nobody would call
Josh's bitch I'm still blurring I'm
loving this might I'd literally do that
my eyes are popping okay so she said now
onto mascara
today I'm gonna use my pure Beckwith
mascara
honestly I thought this for so long and
use it so much that it's getting quite
clumpy but I love it because it builds
really really easily yeah you know what
I'm not okay
so if mascara I don't have that exact
one but this one looks very similar and
I just got it so when I try a few guys
this is the iconic boom at mascara so
let's go ahead and apply that she's
using kind of Wiggly motions which I
feel like most of us would do Bing I've
not used that hourglass Wendy shame that
many came before it but it looks sweet
as a nut lift today
why not a little baby bottom lashes baby
bottom lashes come on day ten to do out
of baby balton lashes okay
mascara done and that mascara is really
good for boxes FYI and for what was that
you never go out of the night with you I
made these lashes are quite large but I
think it's going to be amazing duo glue
good being one good in that I'm gonna be
lashes so we launched it like just when
you can drive so I'm just gonna use a
little bit of my cat eye brow gel from
Chinese lady GE prays I'm just gonna say
that through because it's a nice dark
blue color cuz I usually wait until if
done repaired and stuff to do this step
because sometimes printer gets in my
braids really okay so she's using
something from Charlotte to be like a
brow fiber so I'm gonna go ahead and use
the new hourglass brow fiber this is
also in a dark brunette shade she's
doing this while her lashes are drying I
know I haven't not shown you a lush yet
I just kind of want to see a lush that
she's going for she said they were big
and wispy and dramatic so I just kind of
want to see what they look like on her
eye and then I'll pick a lash because
she said she doesn't know what they are
Thanks
super helpful this does make your brows
a little bit darker bit more fluffy and
wispy and Jamie I'm just focusing the
lash to be a coronary okay so they're
very fluttery and wispy she's focusing
on the outer corner so I think I'm
actually gonna go in with Koko lashes
queen bee but I am gonna give them a
little trim just so they're a little bit
shorter and then so I can focus them
then on the outer corner and they look
really really similar but I'm gonna cut
from the outside and yeah okay so as you
can see I've given them a little bit of
a cut and applied some glue okay and now
I just really need to squeeze onto the
lash line so yeah just put them on as
easily as that if you can but I'm gonna
yeah go ahead and pop these um okay what
I mean I just use my fingers I'm more
comfortable with my fingers as I gonna
do I use like a tweezer on the inside
maybe these are really similar to what
she's used so I'm living to that and
then again oh we love a big lush doorway
yes
squeeze I'm to the lash line I'm gonna
get my little thing okay so we're gonna
go for a peachy liquid lip cause I'm
gonna use the Buddha Beauty liquid lip
in a bikini babe so she's going in with
like a peachy color you're really bad
okay that's not war okay go with the
darker nude this is again the Hoonah
beauty I could live in jetsetter so a
bit more like yeah a darker nude smells
nice not prepared on these smell good
too
all right cool I'm gonna mix the colors
and I'm not the limit so that's apply
this mmm
yeah I can't like that color bond glad
she's deciding to mix oh yeah I like the
peach color fair but you hate today
what so let's try the need the peach and
then let's Oscar boyfriend's opinion

Jack remember a few guys but he actually
did my back I feel awesome my face okay
