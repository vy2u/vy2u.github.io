it so early it's literally just turning
seven but I feel like I've been up for
ages then up since 5:30 because today is
so exciting today is my meet up at the
super drug in sorry keys with impress
Kathy mine yeah I'm so excited basically
launching and super dragon they just
asked me to come along kind of like a
meet and greet but just kind of help
with the launch of you guys when I come
down see me that you can you do another
pass and all that kind of stuff so I'm
so so so excited to take you with me and
hopefully feel you guys to get in the
Rob like if you come down I want to
block with you guys so yeah I'm so
excited it's time to head out to London
let's do this
we've just got to the story Keys
shopping sometime just waiting for my
agent Fran to get here and then we can
go inside and a little prep and then and
get started
so before we go downstairs and stuff
we've got some what question six I'm
gonna do like a little interview kind of
thing with shout magazine which is
really cool I'm not really sure when
that'll be out or if it'd be like
actually in the magazine or just online
but yeah got some questions there's some
actually quite difficult ones I don't
actually know what song you can you not
help dance return it's on the radio you
know it's questions I like so easy but
you don't know how to answer them but
we're having a practice now so I don't
stutter and flap like you normally did
you guys wanted to know my nails are the
power-up style so they're super short
and round which I prefer that because I
literally can't do anything with claws
and then they have this really nice like
dilatory let me zoom in like accent now
I love them so thanks the ones that I
have on other my own but I'm really
finding these ones if you guys come down
they're gonna be giving these out so
yes I am a back home now honestly odd
that was so much fun
considering it was such like I thought
out location I'm so so happy wits how
many of you guys came but so nice to see
you guys is so nice to finally put like
names to faces and all that kind of
stuff and it was so fun to be there with
impress and get to show you guys the
kind of nails because you guys know I
literally like had an allergic reaction
to like acrylic nails so these have
literally been my savior for the past
couple of weeks I love them I think and
then this vlogger might include like a
little clip of like how to apply them
and stuff so I feel like these will be
so easy like you guys as well if you're
like me and you do a lot of makeup and
you just kind of need your nails slicked
down all of the time but haven't got the
time
like go out and get them done these are
such a good alternative so yeah massive
thanks to impress and Superdrug for
having me and giving me the opportunity
to meet you guys literally I love doing
these kind of things so so so much I
just like to save the minutes like the
memories you know it's like a proper
documentation and I can't let me get rid
of it but it'll just let the permanent
documentation of these times I get to
spend with you guys so I'm so so happy
that I get to do this so yeah I think
I'm gonna at some point I'll add in a
little clip of the demonstration of how
to apply the nails and show you
literally like how easy they are yeah I
literally had the best day I'm so tired
now so I'm gonna have a nap and I hope
the next time you see me I'll show you
how to do them okay so I think I left
off saying that I'll show you kind of
like hard to apply and reapply them just
because I feel like these are so handy
and I'm literally just about to go to a
festival so it's been like a few days
and I've taken most of them off just now
but I left one on so I could show you
sorry that you cannot see my face which
i think is the easiest way to do this so
I've had like these on for a little
while
essentially I'm gonna put like a new set
on because like I just said I'm actually
my way to be fast so I'm gonna put these
on now too
each of them comes with like an accent
nail or you can just apply all this
color and I think I'm just gonna go for
the plain color because I've had an
accent nail on this whole time so
literally you just peel kind of like
from either side almost so like
literally like that and then the same
again on this side just to kind of like
lift it up and you literally can just
take them off it leaves like a little
bit of like adhesive but you know when
you can just like run your finger over
and it comes off like super quick so yes
I'm now just going to take the
to off and then I'm gonna show you how
to apply these so each pack actually
comes with like a little nail file and
comes with like a prep wipe almost so
you can just like file your nails down
file and you like XS good you couldn't
get it off and then once all your nails
are like clean just give them like the
once-over with the wipe and then you can
you know go ahead and apply so I'm just
kind of going to show you how to do one
so as you can see each nail has like a
little plastic like peel back thing and
that's literally all you have to do so
where the peel back thing like is so it
would kind of sit like this on your nail
so the peel back things like at the
bottom of the nail that's literature
what you do so you just peel it back and
then it suggests that you place it down
and then like press down either side and
then just press down in the middle and
then it's stuck on and you can use the
file just to kind of file it down at the
top or to shape it if you want to but
it's literally as easy as that and they
last for weeks so I'm gonna go ahead and
do the rest of my fingers and then I'll
be back to show you the finished result
thought I'd show you like I made sure to
kind of like line them all up because
they do do loads of like stress sizes in
each one so hopefully you should be able
to find one to fit any of them and then
I always just line them up like that to
make it a lot easier for myself so this
is what they look like once they're done
and literally I've been loving short
nails and I feel like they look really
realistic so if you guys are like me and
you just need to be quick or you're a
got like an allergy or you're just so
indecisive all the time and love to
switch up your nails I definitely give
these a go I feel like this is gonna
look so funny because obviously there's
been a duration of time between me
ending this vlog and the last time that
you saw me so this is kind of like my
hair reveal I already have revealed it
on Instagram already but I mean in terms
of like the first video this is kinda
like my hair reveal too so thank you

want to remember forever so I always
like to do these videos anyways thank
you so much like impressed manicure and
kiss and Superdrug
for doing this with me and for allowing
me to meet you guys and like discovering
these nails because they understood my
allergy and my stress so yeah I'm just
so great

able to like film and document them for

that and that's just what Prince dudes
