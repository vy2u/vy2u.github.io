on my last video I asked you guys
actually I asked you guys a bunch of
video requests and so many of you gave
me such good feedback on them so thank
you so much if you answered like my
questions and stuff in my previous video
but one of them was did you guys want to
see the stuff that I got I'm at and
literally majority of you said yes so
obviously as you can tell by the title
that's what I'm doing today I didn't go
to too crazy like I got a few bits I
thought would be fun and I think that
you guys will want to see it in
tutorials so I'm gonna go ahead and sure
my god so I'll start with some of the
stuff that I've got from the balm so I
got the Bahama Mama
bronzer Bahama Mama I don't know why I
said that so with them now I can't even
say it the Bahama Mama bronzer my friend
jazz was telling you that this is the
most amazing color to contour with it's
not too cool it still got warmth to it
so it doesn't look like muddy on your
skin I know that can be a problem with a
lot of contour colors they can be really
gray but this one is already a nice warm
on and I've seen it so much harder at it
and I've always kind of wanted to get it
and if you didn't know I'm at some most
products off-site discounted so I
thought why not get it while I'm there
and I'll obviously insert like a
swatches and stuff of it and show you
the color but yeah I was really excited
to pick this up I always kind of stick
with the same colors for contouring so
now I have something new to try and I've
heard so much about it and yeah you guys
know I'm obsessed with the Big Mama hot
mama
or like the Big Mama blusher that's like
a gorgeous rose gold color so I know
that the bomb cheek products are really
good so yeah I can't wait to try this
one also from the balm I've got one of
the meet Matt palettes this one is meet
Matt Truman II trimmer trim Ramon Ramon
II I'm not really sure he pronounced it
it was the slightly warmer one out of
the two and I don't have many palettes
that are just matte colors and I always
in ilex and tutorials
tend to incorporate some sort of shimmer
so I thought this would
encouraged me to use more matte colors
and try something a bit different so let
me know if you want to see a tutorial
with this I'll show you the kind of
colors and stuff in it now but yeah I am
kind of into the map colors at the
moment so yeah there's any colors that
are calling to you that you'd like to
see a matte look on or like any map
looks like maybe like matte eyes lips
and skin like everything matte then let
me know if you want to see that because
I love know you guys want to see I
always loved the video suggestions from
you because I don't want to just keep
trying out videos that you don't want to
see it because what's the point in that
so yeah if you want to see a tutorial
with this let me know or just like maybe
not as through this palette babe you
like the idea of matte eye looks and
stuff then yeah give us a shout I think
this part would be super handy like on
the go as well like oh it's got like a
really big mirror and it's like quite
small about the size of my hand so and
it's quite thin too so I thought that's
good for traveling and I always loved
their packaging the bond package means
like my favorite next up I got some
things from Milani
I actually got two blushes I have a few
of their blushes anyway so I was quite
conscious to make sure I didn't get the
same one obviously everyone's obsessed
with Luminoso and I've got some other
ones as well so this one is called
coralina
iodide that baked blushes like have a
such a gorgeous glow to them and I love
that any sort of blusher that's gonna
give me any like more radiance and more
like bronze like the two months I picked
up a slightly warmer in tone yeah this
was coralina um I thought the kind of
more orange undertone wouldn't really
make my eyes pop because I'm not a
massive blush aware but when I do it is
a lot warmer is more Coralie kind of
colors Coralie like peachy tones so this
one I was like instantly drawn to and
then we have this one and this one is
called bellissimo bronze so as you can
tell by the name is slightly more warm
and slightly more of a bronzey at color
but it's still of like an orange e'er
tone I feel like I could wear this as
like my bronzer and blush it's that sort
of color like almost like a two in one
product and I'm obsessed it's really
warm and especially if I'm more tanned I
think this would look stunning to it
also if you're slightly more
on the tan side should definitely check
this out I think this would look
gorgeous especially you have like blue
actually probably like any color eyes
but I was gonna say more like blue lui
greeny eye color I think this is look
beautiful moving on I took a stop off at
the eye candy booth which is basically
amazing glitters and they had this deal
going on and it was like six glitters
for twenty eight pounds for me and my
friend jazz got three glitters each
because we we couldn't decide but I
decided not to go with like the classic
bronzy gold e blues just thought I'm
normally drawn to I wanted to get
something different and more colorful so
if you guys like the look of any of
these glitters and you want to see a
look with them let me know
so the first when I was instantly drawn
to because I thought it was gonna make
my eyes really pop is this one and it's
called tangerine twist I'll do a
close-up of it now so you can see would
have been a good idea to take the past
give me slack and strength yeah a super
like electric orange II kind of color I
don't have like some sort of summary
glittery type look with this would be up
anyone's street I know it's of mine so
let me know if you want to see it or
maybe just like I look on Instagram or
something but yeah it looks really
really orange in my viewfinder but it is
definitely a bit more kind of Coralie so
it's like a neon coral I'm obsessed I
can't wait to use this I can't remember
if I said or not but that one was called
tangerine twist then we have this one
called peach fizz a little fruity names
this one it's definitely a lot more red
it's got a really nice iridescent
finished here when the ladies switched
it on at my hand it was definitely more
of a red glitter and that's not really
something I've seen before I've not
really seen any sort of like a red
glitter look so let me know you want to
see something with that it has like a
like I said iridescent kind of gold
tinge to it which is why I was drawn to
I think it's stunning sorry I can't
really show you more like I haven't
really got the glue and stuff to do
swatches for them so I'll probably have
to do looks at them and then you guys
can tell me whether or not you'd want to
see tutorials with them but yeah you can
kind of get the hint of the color
today and I got a color that was
slightly different for me as you know
both of them are still quite warm even
though I said I was staying care about
the golds and stuff I mean that's still
like orange and bread so I decided to
get a blue glitter and this one is
called icing oh my god this is like
mermaid it just reminds me of a mermaid
I'll show you it has you probably see
it's got like purple and gold like
reflex to it
I'm obsessed like I know I did something
like awkward glitter the other day but
this one's definitely look more like a
sky-blue and normally I don't work blue
because I'll see I've got blue eyes but
I was just instantly drawn to this I
thought we could do something really
called it so let me know if you like the
look of that one as well
speaking of glitters I went to the list
and this is where I did go back to like
my bronze and copper roots it was too
much I couldn't I just couldn't resist
and then I got a liquid metals once or
two without first this one is called a
dick dent oh yes so this is one of their
liquid metal ones so the finish of this
one isn't as kind of particle E as that
glitters it goes on a lot more like like
it sounds like a liquid and it has a
very metallic finish of the color so
this one it's like a champagne rose gold
type color oh you know I'm about these
kind of colors I'm obsessed and I
actually didn't know that lick did them
I thought lit just did glitters but this
is dope and I can't wait to try
this one then I got three glitters one
in cowgirl one in Oprah and one in at
fully nude but let me show you so this
one is cowgirl if that doesn't scream
Rachel area at you then I don't know
what it is I saw it and I was like yep
that's mine thank you so much in my
basket so they had a deer line and it
was like three glitters 425 pounds I
think or something like that but yeah
I've gotten wait to use this but
obviously I feel like I know the kind of
look I would do with it so I might
actually do a tutorial on like my go-to
actually have I done a go to clubbing
look before I haven't like this is not
something I would like well on a night
out you know my like too dark smoky eyes
get up you know big lashes you know the
drill so maybe something like this or
like the others then we have Oprah which
is quite similar bit more of a rose gold
that was like proper proper copper
proper bronzy in my view binder they
look exactly the same
alright you wouldn't be done but this
one is definitely more of a rose gold
color and I think the size of the
glitter actually is it the same yeah I
think it is yeah it's the same size a
bit a bit bigger glitter so it will
stand out a lot more but you know I'm
obsessed with these colors so you know I
had to get them I don't care if they
look the same
I'm gonna get in anyway it's my kind of
color yeah you love glitter like me
these two colors are bombers
especially if you have a blue eyes I
definitely recommend cowgirl and Oprah
and the final glitter that I got is
called fully nude and it is your classic
like soft gold color so it looks like
this when it's on when they switched it
on me actually was quite like a silvery
gold it kind of reminded me of the
Midnight Cowboy glitter liner from Urban
Decay which I'm obsessed with but yeah I
think this would be really pretty for
like problems and stuff so yeah I'm
excited to try this about obviously a
bit more excited to try the more coppery
colors but this is just as gorgeous lit
have such an amazing like glitter range
if you've not tried any of that glitters
I doesn't recommend them they're like
the easiest to use as well and I'm
obsessed I will have I've got champagne
wishes as well and then like I was
asking which one should I get she was
like champagne wish salsa I've already
got it she is that I knew you were yeah
so that's how I got from the lids and
and the last two things that I got what
from the love makeup stand which is
basically love makeups like an online
cosmetics distributor just distributor
type brand like Beauty Bay or copies
like they don't have a brand brand of
makeup they just distribute other
companies on their things it was really
exciting to get hold of some of those
brands so I picked up a orange Z palette
just because you can never have too many
and sometimes like it's scent patterns
of stuff like sometimes if like makeup
geek or Anastasia Beverly Hills they
come out with new eyeshadows they kind
of only send the pants I've got nothing
to put them in so it's always worth
having something like having this handy
and I've not got an orange one so I'm
excited to put something in here and
finally I mentioned this in my previous
video I got a new and different
translucent setting powder I got the RCM
a no colored powder I've heard so so
much about this and I literally non-stop
using my Laura Mercier one so I wanted
to mix up and try something new and I
think this one is obviously a bit more
affordable as well so I'll let you know
how I get on with this one obviously the
Laura mess you want it's my ride-or-die
one as of yet this one might be a
game-changer I'm not sure but yeah so
I'm really excited to try this and see
if it is just as good if you guys have
tried this already let me know in the
comments and let me know what you think
because I've heard like mixed reviews
but I have heard that is phenomenal so
that is everything that I got from my
max I know it's not like a massive haul
anything but I did say but you guys did
want to see so if there's anything that
I've shown that you want to see a
tutorial with definitely let me know
especially with I got quite a few
glitters and I know loads of people love
glitter loads especially the more kind
of colorful kind but I know you guys
like the copper ones too don't deny it
even though I do them a lot give this
video a thumbs up if you want to see
kind of more makeup holes or clothing
holes and stuff I didn't mention about
sort of dabbling into the more clothing
type videos and loads of you said yes so
