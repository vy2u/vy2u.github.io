I will feel tomorrow
good morning everyone is actually Sunday
morning now so it is Mother's Day and
the day that smoke will go out but
yesterday I went like it was just like I
didn't do anything all day was so so
tired and hungover from the weekend I
just went in took a pit of just nothing
so well done today in my bed my mom and
dad and my sister came back from you
yesterday because they are about to come
round without coffees and puff pastries
and stuff which is sweet and then we're
going to move some stuff into here and
then we have a family dinner later
yeah I love the bits I can and then come
see some what's the look tonight I'm
just going to now quickly tidy up Colima
aware that they're going to be coming
see anything she's going to do a quick
piece a quick tidy up of the slap oil
guys so basically last night Alex came
round and we did like face month and all
that stuff and I he did the one whip too
like extracting your whole like the life
from your face but even he was like no
any is deeper on and then I cystic cool
and then I did the Grandal and that
basically gives you that silver finish
across the face and remember I used to
really really loved it and then I do it
all tonight and they'll be literally
falling like another day I'm obsessed
today you can see that my skin just
looks really really soft it feels
I mean I did moisturizer afterwards but
yeah menacingly keep doing that when
feeling stress because I think having a
clear skin gives me a clear mind you
know actually look like a song is sprang
out my head but just say my smoothie I'm
pretty sure my sister mom and dad just
arrived so it's about time my sister's
going to see my fat cause he she doesn't
live around her she gives you nice a
month she came down to the weekend never
see Mother's Day so yeah can't wait to
show her how are you of handymen he just
kind of figure out where everything is
going to go in terms of storage why make
out wines and just like to make
themselves at home how comfortable is it
though so my mom and dad have gone now I
just had a look through it I've had my
first shower and it was beautiful and

am at back home now back in my old
bedroom it's this now we've got tackle
or looming literally all my makeup and
stuff like that and then like the
storage for all my clothes got to go as
well so then I'm going to end for
blockheaded because I like you doing
more of these so I want there to be like

will lead up to see a flat tool yeah I
think that's what we're going to be
doing for the rest of the day just like
you're going back and forth moving stuff
over lobster I want the time to be able
to edit this one I'm at home so yeah I'm
gonna call it quits here and just enjoy
