happy as Sunday and if you are new don't
forget to hit that subscribe button down
below and give this video a massive
thumbs up if you love holes today is a
bit of a collective haul recently I did
a bit of shopping I got a lot of clothes
a lot of jewelry actually and a lot of
makeup so I thought why don't just pile
it all into one video and show you guys
what I got I know this is kind of more
like that makeup Channel but loads of
you guys are all my answer and stuff
whenever I post outfit just think it's
such a good engagement with you guys so
I feel like I'm gonna share like more
clothing side of things with you because
that's like obviously a big part of my
life and something I really enjoy and it
gives you kind of looking at all like
sense and toy style so I thought yeah
today we're gonna do a big clothing haul
show some accessories makeup that I've
been like obsessing over recently that
everybody want to get my hands on and
share with you guys I haven't actually
tried a lot of it out yeah but it was
stuff that I just like knew I really
wanted to get you know so you've got a
mix of brands in here today we've got
the classics and then some that alike
American brands that I personally all
bought myself neither it was sent to me
this is gonna be a try on clothing haul
as well like bar like I'll see some of
the makeup items and a couple of the
outfit ones because I've already worn
them so I'll just like insert pictures
but yes let's go ahead and start off
with misguided so because it's getting
colder a lot of this stuff that I've got
is kind of more tailored towards the
knitwear and jumpers and like
long-sleeved stuff so the first thing I
got was literally just this plain red
kind of off the shoulder jumper I think
I already said this from misguided yet I
already have this in a nude and I've got
the one I have in like a camel nude
color in the size like medium to large
and after like washing it a few times
and stuff it's just like a little bit
like too too big like this one as well
like they're just like a little bit too
too big so I got this one in like the
smaller to medium size and I love it
class red is my favorite color plus I
think I could wear this at Christmas or
on Christmas Eve it's not like that
first of beena it's just like a read off
the shoulder jumper they do it so many
colors of these so Reds not your faith
definite like click the link down below
and look at the other colors that they
have because these are so warm and cozy
and I feel like they just kind of go
with anything like walk on a pair of
jeans perhaps hoops and you kind of look
pretty put together and all is is a
brightly colored off-the-shoulder
jumper which as you can tell I'm like
loving at the moment so yes from me
and then the next few things kind of all
go together and I'm gonna insert a kind
of picture of when I wore it all here
you guys it seemed to really really love
this outfit and I was not like a bit
like scared to wear it but it's just not
something that I would usually wear and
it was all from misguided so it's the
pin stripe blazer and I don't know if
you can really tell but the colors on
this Ally oranjee red black and green
and none of them are really like the
colors that I wear but I saw them with
the matching like shorts together and
these are the plastic like the paper bag
short so really comfortable and really
flattering to wear I was looking for an
outfit and I had to be like really
last-minute and I saw they're like the
model wearing it with just yeah like a
black brother which I'll show you in a
minute and I thought that looks really
good and I knew that I kind of wanted to
do something a little bit adventurous
with my makeup so I love jackets or any
kind of item of clothing that has like a
pop of color especially if it's a color
that I love to wear aka
orange I knew I wanted to incorporate
like I'm matching a bright lip with it
so that was just kind of a cup blazer
and it's short set that I got see I
would have inserted the picture and what
I will with it was a leather brawler
this one again it's from misguiding I
thought you could wear this looks like
anything or just like underneath I got
off the shoulder jumper like this so you
don't see bra straps like that and yeah
there was more the leather theme because
I kind of wanted to add a little bit of
a different fabric in there with the
blazer and shorts and I love a blazer
that if you know me I love a good blazer
and I quite like a matching set to I
feel like they look really like put
together outfits and kind of look like
you've tried a lot harder than like
obviously really that you have but yeah
this was just the broth I chose to wear
with there and like I said I felt you
could wear this like underneath
oversized things just to mix it up with
the fabrics and it was super super
comfortable and I got mine in the size
like 12 I think too thick my chest so
that was actually everything that I got
from misguided which I know like wasn't
a lot by I thought I would include it
anyway the next kind of place I got
everything from was Windsor store now I
heard of Windsor store through the kind
of big American Beauty it goes like desi
and like I lost half a year Karen Katie
or if then they all love Windsor store
so I'll go through it then now
all the clothes I got loads of jewelry
from them as well because that jewelry
is so so so nice for just kind of like
staple a basic like diamond accessories
I love them Windsor store do amazing
quality bodysuits like over the years a
lot of the body suits that I would have
posted picture nor whatever a from
Windsor store so I wanted to pick up a
few a basic one because I am actually
gonna have like a wardrobe clear out I'm
just gonna keep all the basic and like
the stuff that I actually wear cuz
there's so much in my water that I
literally do not touch so I've got three
basic or dear suits this one is just a
plain black one I think I've got this in
the size medium medium I got this in a
size and medium and it's kind of that
cut that so it's not V it's not high now
I can't remember the kind of cut that
it's called they're just described as
like the little basic bodysuit so I've
got one in black and the thing about
these the fabric of them is so soft and
such good material like it's super super
stretchy and it's not see-through at all
so like I don't wear these with a bra
because there's straps are too too thin
but I've got it in a size that like
still can hold me up so I got it in
black I also got it in white because you
can't go wrong with like a white buddy
so you put my these two think jeans I
wore this the other night with these
trousers I also got from Windsor store
so I'll obviously show you all of these
bodysuits with those trousers I think
just so you can see what it looks like
yeah this one I got in white and I
actually got this one in maybe a large I
think just because I didn't know the
condition of the fabric at the time and
sometimes with white when it stretches
over like certain areas it's a little
bit see-through so I didn't want them to
arrive in the medium be like a little
bit too small and then when I wear the
white one in the medium you can like see
a little bit of an image or anything
like that but no the work the large is
actually love it too big but it's fine
so yeah I also got it in what and then I
also got it in a burgundy but now I'm
like feeling it this one's actually a
little bit of a different fabric to
those two I think like those two are the
same as each other and this one is just
like a little bit different it's a
little bit more of that like lycra
stretchy material whereas that one's a
lot more like a soft suede II ish
material but it's like it's not suede
big topics
it's just like a lot more softer yeah I
thought I'd get burgundy because I don't
think I actually own a burgundy bodysuit
and obviously it is the autumn time now
and these kind of colors I gotta come
around you could match it with like a
duck lip or a duck I just a pair of
black like leather jeans something like
that so yeah another basic bodysuit add
to the collection now these I was kind
of super anxious to get but I'm so glad
that I did because I'm obsessed over
them and I've had so many compliments
whenever I wear and I think I saw them
on like desi and that's like what
inspired me to get them do these are
called the Oliver major body cargo pants
now aren't they're basically just like
yeah cargo pants with the camo print all
over them a really big long like the
belt that actually kind of like dangles
down when you wear it which I feel like
is really in it's like off-white vibes
kind of thing I've got these because I
didn't know what the fabric was I got
these I think in a large maybe mean it I
can't see on the label but whatever
sighs I did get I wish I got the size
smaller because they're actually really
like stretchy and I didn't realize but
that's okay that makes it a little bit
more flattering on me but yeah I'm
literally obsessed with these I wore
I've worn this with like a big camel
like waterfall coat the black body so I
have black boots on so many people were
really complimentary of it the trousers
in they're a little bit different and I
feel like cargo print around this time
of year again because it's like that all
of the new dark vibes is really in right
now yeah these aren't the nicest like
ones that I've seen ever I saw them on
wings I was like you know what I'm gonna
get them because I've seen like other
brands do them but they weren't that the
print wasn't like exactly what I would
have gone for that was a little bit like
not as green or whatever so these were
like literally like such a good
investment and they're still in stock
and hopefully fingers crossed well they
were when I linked them so the link to
these are down below and obsessed with
these and the final clothing items that
I got from Windsor was this this becomes
really really really see this is like a
black a blazer lacy
so it just looks like an over sized
blazer it'll be so much easier when I
try it on but it's actually got built-in
shorts so yeah it's a place treat that
just looks like a oversized blazer
shorts but it's actually like all built
in obviously I like insert what it looks
like on here I love my he said I love a
good blazer and I love a good place
because I saw that announcer oh my god
like I feel like that would look amazing
you could read it the big like not like
a big I'm get this simple necklace that
comes all the way down I don't think you
can really wear a bra with this but
maybe like I think I when I tried this
on initially I thought right I
definitely now want to get like a black
lace bra to go with this so yeah I love
this and all the clothing that I've got
from Windsor actually fits amazingly so
their size so I thought are quite true
to size it or anything like a little bit
generous so if there's room to like
breathe and stuff like that so I
literally loved everything clothing item
I got from Windsor and they've left it
all down below and finally from Windsor
I've got a bunch of jewelry because they
have that the best simple statement
jewelry as I swear I've got like so much
the first thing I've got was like this
simple diamond gold bracelet as you can
see it's one of those ones where you can
just tighten it by pulling on the little
ball like that
but it's literally just like a simple a
diamond gold or bracelet I didn't really
have any simple bracelets to go it
sounds like my bigger bracelets that I
have that make sense and I always like
to accessorize jewelry with other
jewelry of just like different sizes so
I saw this and definitely wanted to get
my hands on it the next thing I got was
just a basic pack of like a diamond stud
earrings I go through these like no
tomorrow they're kind of like the only
of studs that I wear like big diamonds
like this so I thought this gives me a
little variety and I feel like they
weren't even that expect that expensive
either so I thought this was just like a
good pack of mixed studs because the a
like I said I'd go through the more
earrings that I got are these are
private thin shimmery
hoops from Windsor they're like of a
medium size I would say and they are
gold I can't remember if they did them
in a silver too but they're almost like
a twisted pattern to make them look the
super super shimmery and I didn't have
any hoops like this so I thought why
don't pick up a pegs I think all the
gold hoops I have actually looked really
really big so I wanted to get more of
like a medium and wearable size for like
everyday cash Phibes and
and I got two of these a bracelets which
are the same but one is silver and one
is gold
they're called the rhinestone ex
bracelets and they're super like movable
so they don't come in sizes or anything
like that bi got them in silver and gold
and I just thought these were kind of
really like simple but kind of extra at
the same time like super super blingy
but not too too in-your-face and I
really like the ex kind of style of them
and then the next thing I got were rings
so maybe if I try them on it'll be
easier to show you all of the styles so
this came as a set it's called the gold
new perspective ring set I think so as
you can see I'm really liking that like
a cross pattern at the moment they
thought the cross would go if I wore the
cross a bracelet and then obviously
these are - here are more of like the
stripes and look a bit more like simple
if that makes sense so I really really
like them I don't like anything it -
like blingy on my hands and I don't know
if I would wear them all on the same
hand I'd probably like mix it up a
little bit but they're just kind of like
super thin and oh yeah please ignore
this nail like it happened yesterday but
yeah I just thought they are stunning
and they go with what obviously they'd
go is like everything and just add a
little glam extra Ness to your outfits
and then the last thing I got was a
another ring as well but this was
definitely more of a statement ring it's
actually called the gold rhinestone
statement ring it's just a lot more
thick a lot more blingy a lot more
gangster and I just thought you know I
actually really like the thick kind of
rings like this like thick band rings I
know get rid of this finger cuz it's
really annoying me so this one is the
gold rhinestone statement ring it
definitely is a statement if you love
accessorizing and looking a little bit
extra and a big thick chunky rings
definitely get this one I've been
wearing it like a non-stop so the
affiant clothing items that I got work
from in the style they recently had a up
to a 50% off sale on all of their
clothes so I picked up a few bits the
first thing I got is this black
distressed oversized and jumper so you
can't really see from when i holding up
it's one of those jumpers has got like a
few poles in it and i thought and when
everybody really thought about my
wardrobe I don't really like half the
black jumpers but I had
like they're either too sure or they're
too like it she will or anything like
that so I thought I would get like just
a new black jumper and I love a good
distressed vibe so I picked this one up
while it was in the sale another kind of
basic jumper that I picked up is this
kind of mala gray and jumper dress so
yeah I think it's actually a jumper
dress and I thought that this would look
really good with just some like ankle
boots and maybe some like silver
sunglasses or something or like the
silver bracelets and a little bit of
like a faux fur juillet that kind of
vibe for the autumn time because I
always get really hot and so I don't
like to wear like too many layers so I
don't mind getting up my legs out a
little bit for the cold yeah I just
thought why not get like basic grey I
feel like I've got like black cream and
other colors and I didn't have a great
one so I thought this was a nice one to
pick up while the sale was on and the
final item of clothing I got from in the
style and just in general is this yellow
checked shirt from the sara Ashcroft
range I wanted to get it when it wasn't
on sale and it's kind of always been in
my bookmarked favorites like always in
my basket but never actually purchased
everything and then as was once a lit
was super super affordable so I thought
you know this is a sign I'm gonna get it
I'm actually dying my hair darker
tomorrow and I feel like yellow and just
dark brown hair looks so nice together
especially with a tan and this kind of
yellow mustard color is again one that
I'm really loving for around this time
of year so I thought you could just pair
this with a pair of black jeans I've got
these like black sunglasses that I can
really see me are wearing with these and
yeah just like another jacket or
something you know cash wise but you
could probably really dress it up too
and a lot of the checkered shirts that I
have I like red and that kind of thing
so I thought I'd get something a little
bit different so they were all the
clothing and jewelry items that I got
I'm feeling I'm gonna repost this video
kind of or like really show you guys
this video on Black Friday next week or
when any of these brands have a Black
Friday sale so I'm sure they will and
maybe you can get them like discounted
slightly so hold tight hold tight but
finally what I wanted to show you was
the makeup I got so all the makeup I got
was from a beauty BAE I love browsing
they're new in section and just seeing
what's new so the first thing I got was
from LA a splash and this is their
diamond glitter eyeliner in a fool's
gold
nice is that it's like a deep run see
coppery shimmer eyeliner and I love
shimmery eyeliners I can't wait to kind
of draw that on top of my eyes when I'm
not doing I looks or whatever just to
add yeah a little bit more of like a
coppery shimmery bronze so I'll let you
know how I get on with that also I
picked up from morphe the master of
metallics cream shadow set now I kind of
was looking at this thinking like why
have I not seen that before like I get
sent morphe like I'm on that payoff I've
never seen this before or like if I got
sent it I probably throw it away by
accident like how bad is that
well let's pick this up because they
were all shades that I am obsessed with
I'm actually wearing one on my eye right
now I've got a little bit excited but I
am such a lover and fan of cream
eyeshadow so when I saw this set I died
I was like I definitely definitely need
to get my hands on this because they're
so easy to wear and I love all these
kind of coppery and gold colors okay so
the next few things I got all from
Beauty a bakery so the first thing that
I got was the beauty of bakery like
setting powder in translucent now I got
this because I was watching Holly Boone
on snapchat and when she was on holiday
recently I think her friend was taking
these flash photos of her and she had no
flashback whatsoever she just looked
completely Barbie flawless her skin act
insane and I think afterwards she said
that the beauty at bakery is selling
flour powder whatever in translucent is
like the one and it's so good so I
definitely want to pick that up because
if my skin was gonna look anything like
hers I needed it and then the next two
things that I got are the beauty of
bakery illuminators and I already have
they're like yellow based one of this
which I love by picked up the shades
frosted and ice
I think ice said this one is this will
they look like so you get so much
product in there by the way so this is
more of at the ice color it's like your
classic gold shimmer I can't see if you
can see yeah
like you're like champagne e a gold
shimmer these like work best or I think
just look so a good when you have a like
creme illuminator on under
just because it cuz there are loose
powder it just gives them something to
cling to I'm scared it's gonna go
everywhere okay I'm not gonna swatch so
I'm super scared
but this one is more this one is the
frozen one so it's more of your like the
bronze shimmer I love a bronze shimmer I
actually have this kind of like dusted
all around the perimeters like off my
face today and I love the undertone of
this it is so so so nice so these are
plus the packaging it's so cute yes so I
picked up those from Beauty bakery and
the next thing I picked up was the
cinema secret makeup brush cleaner I've
heard amazing things about this and I
haven't cleaned my brushes in so long
it's so bad so I've got this in hopes to
inspire me and motivate me to clean my
brushes it's like a spot cleaner I'm
excited to try this because I don't
clean my brushes in aged anybody need to
out of have any great things thank you
and I picked up a pair of lashes oh my
god these to me just look like the most
gorgeous everyday like flattery lash
extension esque lashes these are from a
unicorn lashes in the style lemon
meringue so they look like that and
