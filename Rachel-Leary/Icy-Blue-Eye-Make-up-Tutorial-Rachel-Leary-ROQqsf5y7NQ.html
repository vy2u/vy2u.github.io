thank you so much for watching so today
I am starting off with my skin and just
moisturizing and applying primer all
products are in the description bar down
below then for my eyebrows I'm doing
as always my Anastasia tip for our
medium brown and using this aegyo pen
just to define anxiety it's a new
product that I've been really liking at
the moment then for skin I know that's a
massive jump in terms of skin tone but I
was fake tan so I just obviously color
correcting then going in with concealer
this is my NARS radiant creamy concealer
in it custard and just applying that to
all the normal places that I would
normally I'm doing my skin first today
because the eye look I'm doing doesn't
really require me to do any liner or any
kind of clean-cut edges so like I said
just doing my skin first then using my
hourglass ambient lighting powder just
to underneath my eyes and contouring
using Mac's harmony blusher this is such
a nice warmer contour shade if you don't
like those kind of cooler tones this is
just kind of a cool atonal blusher which
I love then oh my god I just got this
the other day and I'm in love with it
it's the sparkling dust by Inglot in the
shade 0-3 I'm using it for bronzer and
it honestly just makes your skin look
radiant and glowy which is kind of tying
in with the kind of icy look that we're
going for and I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills starlight highlighter to
highlight my cheekbones and Cupid's bow
and down the bridge of my nose just cuz
it's got that perler finish so it's
slightly cooler in tone to tighten it
with
blusher I am using this baby pink shade
from makeup geek would first love
just because when it's on top of the
bronzer and stuff it gives that kind of
cool a tone like I said which is too
tight and with the eye makeup which we
will start now I'm taking this palette
from morphe it's 4:35 tea and just
mixing these two softer brown shades
together on this is a wave of fluffy
crease brush and just buffing that into
the crease kind of smoking it out and
taking it out towards the edge of the
brow but obviously not making sure to
pass stickers to do another like we've
been punched in the eye but just going
in circular motions and making sure it's
all blended really softly so a tip for
doing that is just to go in with a clean
fluffier brush this is a sigma e40 just
to get the shape and blended you know
edges that you want I'm then taking this
35d palette and these two darker blue
shades on a smaller fluffy brush and
just using this to further deepen up my
socket these do have a bit of shimmer to
them and normally I would use matte but
to go with the kind of icy effect it
does kind of work and then going back in
with this away the brush with no extra
product on it just to soften out the
edges and then kind of repeating the
process to build up the color intensity
that's why I'm after for my lid shade
I'm taking this foiled eyeshadow from
makeup geek in the shade whimsical which
on the pan looks kind of violet but I
find when it's on the lid it does look
more like an icy white shade so I'm just
using a flat brush to press this onto my
lid and kind of blend it towards the
outer edges then taking this shade from
Anastasia Beverly Hills in this day in
that shade stark hobo it's basically a
foiled eyeshadow in an electric blue I'm
using that to transition the lid shade
into the two crease shades that we
placed earlier just on a fluffy brush
and blending that back and forth in kind
of windscreen light and wiper motions
then I'm taking this matte dark pur
purple this matte dark blue shade to
further deepen the socket
using any map white eyeshadow i'm just
using gesso from mac i'm just
highlighting my brow bone and my inner
corner i really wanted my inner corner
highlight to be super bright so i'm
going in the highlighter that we used on
our cheeks earlier just to really
intensify the kind of brightness then
i'm just gonna go ahead and place the
whimsical shade just towards my inner
corner on my lower lash line and take
the blue shade that we used earlier on
my lower lash line and buff it all out
with the soft brown shades then i'm
applying mascara and lashes these are
the Saffir lash from velour and like I
always say I have my discount code down
below for the lips I wanted to keep it
pretty nude so all the focus would be on
the eye makeup so I'm just taking this
pro longwear pencil from Mac in the
shade cultured miss lipstick which is a
satin finish but you could just leave it
as that I wanted to add a bit of sparkle
as always so I am going in with sugar
rim to dazzle glass on the top and that
is the finished look I really hope you

New Year's Eve tutorial for you on
Thursday which is a collab which I'm
really excited about so I hope you guys
