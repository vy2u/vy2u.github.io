have created this kind of more wearable
I would say Halloween makeup look the
beginning of this tutorial Charlie
starts that was kind of a normal
Instagram glam type makeup and then you
just kind of go crazy with blood and
stuff so definitely one of those kind of
looks us a bit more wearable for
Halloween for those of you that don't
want to go drastically dressed up this
is in collaboration with boohoo so I do
have an outfit suggestion as well for
those that don't really want to wear a
costume either they have some really
cool Halloween bits in at the moment
especially the leggings and the skirt
kind of version of these leggings I'm
wearing which I will show you those are
the accessories that are used as well at
this choker and some of the blood and
paint and stuff it's also available on
boohoo so it's like a one-stop-shop for
Halloween at the moment and it's all
really really super affordable yeah if
you like the look of there's a makeup
look then make sure to give it a thumbs
up and subscribe if you haven't already
I've linked everything down below to
make it so much easier for you so let's
go ahead and get started
to start this Instagram glam horror
makeup you want to make sure you've got
those Instagram brows so I'm using my
brow wiz and might benefit car brow and
then I'm also priming my eyes as well
then taking this away the cocoa blend
palette and this warm brown shade I'm
just buffing that into the crease as the
initial transition color then taking
this eyeshadow palette available from
boohoo I am at taking this warm red tone
berry color and taking a small pencil
brush and I'm just using this to create
a cut crease look since I feel cut
creases are really popular on Instagram
at the moment but you can do whatever
kind of eye look that you want
I just thought these colors and this
kind of look was super appropriate and
then I'm going back in with my fluffy
brush to make sure everything is blended
together as usual doesn't matter so much
if you get it on your lid space because
we are gonna really clean it up in a
minute as you'll see we are just using
windscreen wiper motions and blending it
all together and from the same palette
on a smaller kind of flat brush on at
the edge of it I am it just taking this
black color through the crease to really
define and cut the crease and then going
back in with the pencil brush we have
that red shade on again it's just making
sure everything is a buffed and blended
together so then again going in with the
fluffy brush you guys know the drill
just making sure everything is blended
together then taking this white eyeliner
from Oprah this is why it doesn't matter
so much if you get anything on the lid
because we are using it so you're really
a clean-cut the crease so just placing
this all over the lid and then right up
to the crease but we are going to set it
in place with this white shade from the
same so with a palette that we used
earlier then I'm at taking my tart
artists eyeliner I'm using this to
create kind of cutting effects like you
would if it was like surgery where they
would make the incisions as this is a
cut crease we're really gonna play on
that as it's Halloween as well then I'm
just taking a wipe to make it really
clean-cut and giving us a really good
base for our super sharp winged liner
then I'm gonna apply mascara and false
lashes these are the house of lashes
ikonics and this is the kind of top
finished eyelook then I'm just going to
apply primer this is the NYX angel veil
and then a foundation and then I am at
going in with a concealer with the
concealer you want to make sure that
you're really making it that
sharp because we're playing on the whole
Instagram look and you know when
everyone's always like their wing liner
is so sharp that they could cut someone
that's how sharp we want it to be so I'm
just applying this underneath my eyes to
brighten it up but then taking a really
small brush and really really sharpening
up my wing and then it's just blending
it in with a Beauty Blender
as we want our contour to be super sharp
as well I am attacking this new Tarte
ears Pro blow a palette and the two
contour shades I'm using the cream this
is kind of where the makeup starts to
get a bit more kind of fancy dress like
cuz we're going to be quite heavy with
the cream contour because we really
really want it to show up and it'd be
it's super super defined so using the
creams and then using my concealer to
really sharpen it up this was in one of
Michael this was one of my concealer
hacks in a previous video but then I'm
just blending that downwards and as you
can see it created that really really
sharp contoured effect not necessarily
what you would wear every day but like I
said this is kind of like a fancy-dress
makeup look so we are really playing on
the whole cut contour then I'm just
going ahead and baking and setting
everything with powder baking underneath
is another way to make your contour
super sharp so definitely want to make
sure that you're doing that then I'm
going in with the powder contour shade
from that same tart is palette and just
really really sharpening everything up
then also we want to have that Instagram
at glow so from the same palette I'm
like literally mixing all the shades
together and really really kind of
overdoing my highlight just because it's
like I said they're kind of fancy dress
makeup effect that we really want it to
show up but the waterline I am at taking
this mac cherry lip liner it's just in a
different packaging because it was from
a limited edition collection but there
Terry lip liner is permanent and then
just running that through the waterline
then I'm taking this red paint that I
got from a boohoo
I'm just using this underneath my eye
making sure not to really go go into at
my waterline but I'm just using this as
like a base for the blood I feel like
this is a lot more pigmented than using
eyeshadows and it looks a lot more
realistic speaking of which I'm taking
this zombie a blood spray that I got
from boohoo as well and I'm just
spraying it into a little container lid
and then using a brush to apply it and
creating it that dripping effect then
I'm taking some liquid latex and
applying this underneath my contour to
create a textured more cuts effect so it
looks like we've actually cut our
cheekbones and just using the end of a
and makeup brush to apply that and then
we're just gonna let that dry and while
that's drying we're gonna go ahead and
do our lips and I'm taking these two
liquid lipsticks from a boohoo and using
the darker one it to line my lips and
then using it the brighter red one in
the middle these liquid lipsticks are
actually super super pigmented and they
smell really a good as well but I wanted
to create a tiny bit more of a darker
ombre effect so I'm taking the black the
same black that we used on our eyes from
that eye shadow palette and it's just
using that to kind of a sketch around my
lips and fade it inwards into the darker
purple and then into the red then going
in with that blood again this is the
kind of container that I used and just
using a brush to place that on the
outskirts of my lips and just literally
all over you can be a totally free well
with this and it use as much or as
little of blood as you want I just
wanted to create like a dripping affair
back to the cheeks I'm using that same
red paint and it's just pressing over
the top of the latex and then going in
with the blood again to create a
dripping motion and looking like it's a
super super cut then I'm going in with
the red eyeshadow from the palette I'm
using that on top of where we just
placed that latex just to really kind of
create more of a 3d real-life effect and
a bit of shading I then went ahead and
it sprayed that zombie blood just on my
forehead just to add a bit of something
going on up there because there wasn't
really anything going on and it just
kind of add to the effect and then this
is the finished makeup look so then I
went ahead and just took up my hair down
you can do whatever kind of hair look
that you want with this and then I
decided that I wanted to add something a
bit more to my chest so I went in with
that zombie spray again just sprayed
that on my chest like I said with this
you can go in with as little or as much
as you want I then added a little bit of
gel blood as well just to kind of make
it look a little bit more realistic and
gory with the makeup look complete this
is my outfit I definitely wanted to wear
a choker and I was obsessed with this
one because chokers are super popular at
the moment I then went in with this
velvet Bardot a bodysuit because a
velvet is super on trend at the moment
and these really cute leggings please
ignore the house see-through they look I
promise they're not it's just the lights
but I've linked everything down below
and then your cut look isn't complete
without an inflatable knife to go with
it that was the finished makeup an
