my god today's an exciting day
today I have created Italy and makeup
look obviously that you saw in the
introduction with India long-awaited
jaclyn hill animal feed collaboration
palette i'm sure you have seen this
literally everywhere and if you haven't
or you don't know who Jackson and spiral
where the hell have you been
honestly she is like the og YouTube
makeup impose she's been creating ultra
glam looks that new one pasted on
yourself from like day one well she was
that person for me anyway so I feel
beyond like honored to have been sent
her palette like oh my god it contained
literally every color you could ever
want ever to be on your eyes on a few
screens Jackson community watch her she
is very much like me in the sense that
she loves a woman nude golden bronze
smokey eye but when it comes to pops of
color blues teals and greens I like the
way to go so literally I was dying at
two uses palette as soon as I got it and
I just want to get you guys excited I'm
pretty sure it comes out image and line
maybe I'm let me wrong I'll try and find
a date and leave the link to it down
below
Jackson's also just released a video of
the swatches and have story behind as
well as I will leave the link to that
down below yes if you would like to see
one way of how to use that amazing
palette then it definitely make sure to
give this video a thumbs up subscribe if
you haven't already and then let's get
on with the true
okay so I've already gone ahead and
primed my eyes and done my eyebrows
because one I don't know I'm going to
share about that but I have this did all
of you products like these down below
but I just thought people would rather I
just cracked straight on with the
eyeshadow using the incredible brand new
Jackson Hale morphe palette oh my god
this is actually the palette that dreams
are made of
well there is for me anyway if I just
zoom out and show you this is what the
palette looks like the kind of top 3/5
of all that the walnut air in your
classic Jacquelyn colors and then the
two bottom rows include some gorgeous
gorgeous bright colors and then a bit
more like eight cruller darker selection
so they've really literally is something
for everyone in this palette I'm not
even coming out of it this is going to
be a go-to everyday palette to me this
is the first time but I'm using it and I
definitely wanted to venture into the
colors I feeling this dark blue so I
think that's what we're going to do
today so I think I want to go for quite
a dramatic winged look so that's why
we're doing the eyes first so I can
avoid the way and get that clean edge
like I always do okay so to begin I am
going to take this color here and this
is the color mf0 we're only going
something like a really excited again oh
yeah these blend like a dream oh my god
I mean just the first color but I barely
dipped my brush in that I'm not even
kidding
I'm just going to continue to above that
into the crease for our initial
transition these colors are so great
because if you're kind of not like
scared shadow but don't like anything to
a drastic these kind of colors are
almost like the perfect makeup erases
they just have a buff and blend
everything and make your blending look
way better than it might be okay the
next color we are going to take is this
one here and this one is called butter
would you like me to assign someone to
butter your muffin
yeah the formula of beef is so like oh
my god just like velvety they just blend
so
effortlessly into each other I mean I've
only tried the maps as you can see so
far the so far so good I can totally
understand now why it took so long
absolutely stunning right now let's get
darker I want to be using kind of
orangie colors because we're going to be
using blue in the crease so I am gonna
take this but orange color here which is
called Roxanne does that not just remind
you of that friends Oh
does that not just remind you that
friends episode but it's when Phoebe
sing rock it can get a ticket I
literally live for these warm colors it
was so hard to not do like a bronze
golden smokey eye because I can tell
this palette is like perfect at art it's
about do it for the cruise colors for
now and now going to move on to it DNA's
color and for that I'm going to take
that gorgeous why just electric of blue
and this is called twerp so you can see
why I wanted to use that one I'm going
to be using a Mac to afford to thinness
just because it's really very shimmery I
thought this brush is really great at
applying like shimmery oil their shadows
oh I'm living out of this blue oh my god
I mean there's another fallout that with
these kind of pigmentation from shadows
I I would expect there to be a little
bit of fallout this blue is so bright
but that blue i think is actually
stunning i think it would look so pretty
like underneath the eye as like a pop of
color on like the lower lash line but
now i'm just going to go back in with
that burnt orange shade I think it was
rocks in and just diffuse that blue into
our crease colors just to soften the
edge a little you can see how easy these
are to the land oh my god like
and then I'm going to keep deepen up the
crease so I'm going to take a slightly
darker shade and you take this a dark
brown here and this is called mocha I'm
just going to buff that in up to the
outer most pot it's all about just
creating a transition from light to dark
I feel like when you're doing smoky eyes
like this it's doing the same on the
other eye I always kind of hold all my
brushes in like one hand and that I've
used previously click always jump back
and forth between oh my god I'm living
living living so these colors already
and then it finally to deepen up the
crease I'm getting this kind of here
which is called at Central Park I didn't
want to use black just because back on
me I feel it's almost too much so I'm
glad this an alternative to people like
me that are scared of the dark side and
it's going to really concentrate this on
the outermost part and kind of buff
upwards and inwards and then just going
back in with like previous brushes and
colors just to help defuse everything so
we can get the flawless smoky eye that's
just in him of saying on my snapchat the
other day Jacqueline who was one of the
first people that I ever really like
could watch on YouTube and I think it
was her it was when she used to sit in
front of her sofa and maybe do like a
makeup holes or a beginner's guide
smokey eye like the ultimate smokey cat
eye and she was using all her like matte
eyeshadows like that so kind of Jack and
I used to watch all the time and I used
to be literally obsessed I mean I still
am obviously I what time it is all the
time that I'm going to back in the day I
literally binge watch all of her videos
and I always used to want to have a sofa
and the booty cushion like she did but I
think that's it's like the crease I'm
just going to take a wipe and wipe up
underneath because we did have a little
bit for up I'm just going to wipe away
yeah okay so once you have cleaned up
underneath your eyes and clear
that wing I'm just going to highlight my
inner corner before doing the eyeliner
so I'm going in to take this champagne
or a pale rudi pale champagne gold and
it is called beam oh my god that is such
a gorgeous in a corner highlight oh my
god I want to use that everywhere I'm
here I'm going to sell the highlighter I
reckon oh and that was me thinking that
I could never really highlight mine in a
corner but that turns out I was just
missing the perfect child so now I'm
going to go ahead and do a my winged
eyeliner and for that I'm going to use
the NYX epic ink eyeliner pen and then
I'll be back just because I said I'm
going to go down down down and I always
miss the footage so I do have a winged
eyeliner tutorial I always leave it
links down below okay so I have gone
ahead and it done at my winged eyeliner
and now I'm going to go ahead and apply
mascara and add falsies and from afar
today I'm going to take these two Faced
better than sex mascara and for lashes
I'm going to take these gorgeous ones
these are from Escudo and data in their
Styles newness nebula meb ula nebula
something like that they are so gorgeous
and so fluttery once again I'm going to
go ahead and do that and then I'll be
right back and I'll show you the kind of
top half fish eyes and then you can move
on it to the base oh my god either
living and Foley's colors and this
palette I'm not going to go over this
for a while so expect to see me using
and the next 150 tutorials okay so these
are the kind of eyes done with the
lashes the viewers obviously still dry a
little bit but now we can move on to the
skin I get my skin feeling a bit dry so
I'm going to take the touch-up Beauty
oil I mean they lost it where I used
their cream but the whole skin carriage
is just gorgeous applying literally the
highest to little drops and I'm just
going to massage that and to my skin
this stuff smells so good feels oh my
boy I haven't got my cave on who the
hell am i yeah this feels so good and so
nourishing and actually I find I'm
extending my addiction and
a bit easier I have an oil underneath my
skin lovely now I'm going to try a new
product this is the aroma in step six
and go-go-go
spray is a point and setting spray in
one but right now I'm just going to use
it as a face primer I'm not sure how
much of that you're going to use I'm
going hand with Pinal sprays I like to
maybe like overdo it then times do it so
I know it's actually going to do
something and then I just like to press
the remainder in to my skin so
foundation today I'm going to use a old
one but I've been seeing the loads of
people using at the moment so I'm
thinking I should give it another shot
is be a Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation and I'm going to mix these
two colors together it is sand and warm
beige I'm going to do two spots of sand
and just one little pump of warm beige
but with this foundation I always would
recommend using a damp Beauty blender
with it I feel it applies it the best
and really helps to work it into the
skin
I don't know wanting to be used as a
foundation I feel like I applied it
wrong the first ever time I used it and
you know sometimes when you just do it
wrong or one time and then it kind of
like puts you off for life then you just
don't want to go back and use it again I
feel like that's what happened with me
okay I'm going to use and never actually
I'm not even sure if I'd use it before I
can see we're going to be a tarte
maracuja oil concealer in the color
light sand this is quite a thick
concealer so I am going to be applying
this quite sparingly and I am deaf I def
Oh going to be using a Beauty Blender to
blend this out I'm just going to apply
that underneath take up the sides of you
know any one a little bit of inori's
cool tool and then just taking my damp
Beauty Blender and bending and I kind of
want to use it because like I said
earlier my skin's a little bit dry and
this is a really dewy nourishing
concealer because it's part of their
married crude oil range and that's super
super like I want to keep saying thing
like nourishing for your skin really
like hydrating and moisturizing so just
what I need underneath my eyes when
they're feeling a little bit dry okay I
was
kind of a rollin look today so I want to
go ahead and cream at quantity that I'm
going to take my Maybelline and master
contour and this is the shade of medium
and then I take that little highlight a
bit and just you start underneath the
eye as well just to help brighten it up
even more
I'm just going to take a duo fiber brush
to blend this in so that is kind of all
the creams that I want to apply to my
face so far so I'm going to go ahead and
set everything in a place of powder and
then we can go back to finishing off
underneath the eyes okay we are back up
close and personal so I wanted to kind
of play on the complementary colors
because whenever I do blue on the top of
my eyes I feel like I lose the blue from
my actual eyes which is kinda whenever
you do those kind of colors so I am
going to take the of indicate glide on
pencil in it torch to put in my
waterline so that's like a it's super
burnt orange color I feel like that
going to make my eyes pop a little bit
and then it's you buff that in I'm going
to go back in with that Roxanne color so
more of the darker orange that I do for
like this is quite a of sultry and smoky
looks I want to use the dark color
underneath so I'm just going to take
that on a pencil brush and a buff that
in I do want to kind of make this really
learn out and it like smoky underneath
so I'm going to make sure I'm connecting
it back around oh my god yes I am living
for this okay now I'm going to just
apply puttin our chocolates all we're
going to do on the bottom and then that
is the finished eyes okay so these are
the finished eyes with bottom lash
mascara and everything completed I have
to say I am so impressed the
pigmentation of this palette I feel like
everyone's going to say that but really
I haven't tried obviously all of the
shimmers or anything but from what I've
used the crease colors that inner corner
highlight though I'm so impressed so I
can't wait to create more lips for this
but now let's move on it to the say
and finish out of the look so you'll get
into a couple of old favorites I'm going
to use this not color it is we're both
limited edition but I feel like the
shape in it you can get individually so
if a bronzer I am going to take the
Laguna and then I'm going to mix these
two a blusher shades here which are
called deep throat and final cut hope
can safely member I since it's fine fine
fine
we'll move on so just going to warm up
that and define that cream contour that
we applied alum a little bit more I
really like looking I just as a good
nose contour as well because not too
warm but it's not a good cool tone
bronzer I would say and just apply that
blusher
haven't used a nice blush in what feels
like forever and they're some of the
nicest was out those were for
highlighter I'm going to show you a
little technique I've been at loving it
doing at the moment and it is teach a
liquid highlighter and then a powder
highlighter on top so then I can
eliminate I'm going to use in the Marc
Jacobs coconut dewdrops I'm just going
to take a couple a little pop of fat on
the back of my hand and then it use like
my little finger to press that on the
tops of my cheek bone and I'm going to
work right in with my finger just
because the warmth of my finger will
make that easier to blend and using
patting motions it's going to mean I'm
not going to move any of like the powder
underneath I thought it's just going to
blend a lot better
you've got to be a little patient with
this to make sure you get all right just
like that and I mean I would have taught
you champagne pop but I thought it was
more literally like a month ago and I
really need to repurchase I think I saw
she was coming out of that collective
addition so I was going to hold off and
get that one but what I love about doing
this is it gives like a creamy base for
when I apply my like powder highlighter
and then I find that using a like loose
powder highlighter it just clings to and
adds such a gorgeous sparkle so I'm
going to take the office Couture diamond
powder in Illuminati and on a brush this
is from a peaches makeup and
is called that PC 0-3 I'm just going to
literally the lightest tap and that and
then just brush it across you can see I
hope you like to catch in action yeah so
again going on this side
so I just want to have an M on my lips
and now I'm going to apply it deep color
this is V a buxom lightweight liquid
lipstick in the shade
dudas they're so like creamy and easy to
apply I got this somewhat of a slightly
warmer undertone so the earlier
complimenti I make um I feel like it's
over your lip color but better pen color
I love this and then on top of that I
just someone lighten it a little bit
slightly I'm going to go in with it be a
buxom a full-on lip cream I think this
is in White Russian which is honestly
one of my favorite new glosses of all
time
and it smells like sugar so now I'm just
going to go ahead and use the Rimmel at
spray again just to set everything in
place and then I can show you the finish
makeup so this is the finished makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
