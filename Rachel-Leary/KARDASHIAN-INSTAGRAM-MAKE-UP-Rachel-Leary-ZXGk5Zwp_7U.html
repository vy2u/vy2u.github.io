oh hey guys welcome back to my channel
so for today's video I tweeted and asked
if you guys wanted to see a
kardashian-jenner Instagram type makeup
look because I was feeling super
inspired after seeing the pictures that
makeup by Ariel posted of Kendall Jenner
at can she looked flawless and
phenomenal and I always see those kind
of pictures of floating around and I'd
die to know what kind of makeup is
they've used
or how to get that kind of look some of
my favorites or like I said makeup by
Ariel makeup by Samuel he's another one
and also styled by her Uche those three
are like my favorites I'm obsessed with
their makeup feeds and so if you're
interested in that kind of makeup look
this video is kind of my interpretation
of that makeup it's not necessarily
exactly what they use although some
products are and based on kind of
tutorials that I've seen and when they
list their products it is a lot of
makeup mainly skin because I think they
mainly focus on skin and super easy
minimal eyes so it's minimal eyes but a
lot of skin a mix of high end and
drugstore because I think that's how you
get the best of both and the best look
that you can
so obviously switch out products that
you don't have with ones that you do
that will work the same these are just
what I have these are just what I'm
using if you don't like a lot of makeup
probably won't like this video but yeah
so if you like the look of this makeup
look then please keep watching
okay so starting off completely bare
face I'm just gonna get my hair out of
my face now on to skin this is where I
think these kind of kardashian-jenner
makeup artists and that you see all over
Instagram a lot of their pictures it's
their skin that really captures my
attention it is so full coverage so
flawless I feel like they go quite like
I said earlier and minute on the eyes
and a lot of products on the skin so
expect a lot of products to be going on
the skin today and also I feel like a
lot of skin products are more high-end
just because you can get amazing
products from like your local drugstore
and stuff but a lot of I think those
makeup artists invest their money in the
skincare and foundation and stuff so I
have tried to mix up using some
drugstore some high-end it's just kind
of my interpretation and why I think is
going to look the best so to start off
with I'm going to be applying my Mac
strobe cream all over my skin as a
moisturizer and base
you
next up I'm going to be literally
drowning my skin in mac fix+
and then i'm going to be applying my
foundation straightaway afterwards while
my skin is still slightly damp the
foundation I'm going to be using is a
mix between the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation in the shade 6 and the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation in the shade 2 to 0 I've been
holding back on using this foundation so
much in tutorials because it was only
available in the US but I think either
now or very very soon like next week or
the beginning of June or something like
that it's coming to the UK so hold type
and to apply my foundation I'm going to
be using the Sigma duo fiber f15 brush
I'm going to be applying quite a lot of
foundation but I'm going to be going
over with a damp Beauty Blender after
ridges which will absorb kind of excess
product and really push it into the skin
so technically it's a lot less than it
actually is
and you also don't have to mix two
foundations if you don't want to you've
got one that gives you like one that
you're comfortable with and happy with
that gives you like a really flawless
finish by all means just use that I just
like to mix too because I love the color
and the finish of the Giorgio Armani
foundation I also really like the
coverage of the Maybelline foundation
and it kind of adds a bit more of a
yellow tone to the Giorgio Armani one
because the Georgia Armani one is quite
green
once that is all over the skin I'm going
to take my fix+ again spray my face with
it and then go in with a damp Beauty
Blender and just press just kind of
press the fix+ into the skin
now for concealer I'm going to be using
the NARS radiant creamy concealer in it
custard kind of as my under base for my
concealer so this is just going to help
get rid of any dark circles underneath
the eye and then on top I'm going to use
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer in
light warm because this one is a good
few shades lives for my natural skin
tone so this is going to really help
brighten up under the eye
recently I've been loving the more Fiji
for brush to press this into my skin and
buff it in and then once again I go in
with my beach blend and just make sure
that it is really pressed into my skin
I'm just going over my eye as well
because that will help to prime them
normally if you watch my tutorials I
always do my eyes first but I've noticed
with these makeup artists they're so not
jeweled their eye makeup and they kind
of just they always do the skin first
because the makeup that they do doesn't
need to be so precise or cleaned up or
anything so they don't have to worry
about fall out like that and then like I
said just using my Beauty Blender and
just pressing that really into the skin
especially around the nose area where
sometimes if you're wearing a lot of
makeup it can clog and separate now
before we set anything with powder you
want to get all the Korean products up
away and from watching the like on Kai
DS app like the makeup tutorials they do
on there and just some Instagram and
seeing the products they use they do use
cream products when it comes to
contouring and bronzing so I'm going to
be using the Bobbi Brown foundation
stick in the shade almond to draw on my
kind of contour lines and then use a bit
of the Chanel Salida tan to buff that
out the bourgeois chocolate bronzer
priming primer is like such a good dupe
for this
I just I'm using this because I have it
but yeah and kind of draw lines where
you would normally contour
and then taking it the same a brush that
we use for the foundation just swirling
that into the Chanel product then using
that to buff it in you want to buff in
an upward motion you don't want to drag
the contour down because that's going to
make your face look really something and
you want it to be lifted like a
Kardashian surgery cheekbone say hey
once that is all a blended in we are
going to set our under-eye and
underneath that contour to really
brighten and shopping it up and to use
that I'm going to use my trusty Laura
Mercier setting powder this is honestly
the best stuff for the job and I'm going
to take the damp Beauty Blender that we
used earlier and just press that
underneath the eye just next and I nose
essentially just in all the places that
you want to enhance and brighten up like
so while that is cooking or baking I'm
going to go ahead and do my eyebrows and
I'm going to use the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow definer in soft brown and I
will be right back I think with the
pencil you can just achieve a lot more
of a natural softer brow which is tends
to be the style that all those makeup
artists prefer plus all the Kardashians
and Jenner's have naturally full brows
anyway now to wipe away the loose powder
a technique that I love my friend is to
take actually like a banana powder or a
brightening powder and just take a
little bit on your brush and use that to
wipe away
the powder and it almost gives a more of
a brightening effect
then I'm going to take my Maybelline
master sculpt and just take this contour
color here and just on a really precise
fluffy brush this is a way the luxe
powder fusion brush just take that on
the end and just really define the
contour I'm also going to take this
tiniest bit down my nose next up I'm
going to take a blush up this is a NYX
ombre brush in the color soft flush and
a really kind of nice coral color I'm
just going to grab a blusher brush
then for that kind of a Kardashian glow
I'm going to take global glow mineralize
skinfinish from Mac on a 135 brush also
from Mac and just literally applied this
as a bronzer highlighter and just dust
it everywhere it gives such a subtle
bronzed glow to the skin so that is most
of the skin complete now we're going to
move on to the eyes so this is the kind
of eye look I came up with obviously
I've not applied lashes yet which is a
massive part so that will be coming it
next but they always go very soft with
their eye makeup I think like I said the
main focus is always the skin and so
I've just done something really soft and
really neutral so I'm going to show you
how to do it on the side so I'm going to
be using the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette for this and using all shadows
from here so to start off with I'm a
taking this warm brown color on a fluffy
crease brush and just buffing that into
my socket and cause we applied that
concealer to the eye earlier it's kind
of already primed our eye for us so like
I said I'm just buffing that into the
socket but I'm kind of making sure to
take it out slightly to create a kind of
soft loan-out effect like so then on a
slip still on a fluffy brush but
something slightly more tapered I'm
going to take that same kind of again
but mix it with this darker brown color
here to add a bit more depth and
definition I'm kind of concentrating
this on the kind of outer part of my eye
like so and then going back in is the
original brush and just softening out
those edges for the lid color I'm going
to mix these two shimmery shades here
because they've always got something
kind of light and golden II champagne e
on their lid like that and then going
back in with that brush and just
blending and diffusing it all together
then on a pencil brush I'm going to take
this color and this color and just use
that to highlight my inner corner now
taking a brown eye pencil this is
expresso from makeup geek and you can
use whatever one you want I'm just going
to run this along my top lash line and
down towards my outer corner and then
also tight line with it and you can be
quite messy with this because we are
going to blend it out like that and
taking this really precise pencil brush
this is from the waver mixing the two
kind of cruise colors that we used
earlier and using that to pretty is
soften and blend out that line
like that then taking an angled brush
and mixing this dark brown color here
with this one here I'm going to create a
really soft wing just using kind of fat
lotion
so I'm really quickly going to tightline
with that brown pencil as well for the
lower lash line I'm going to mix those
two dark brown colors again on that same
angled brush and just really press up
into my lashes like that on a pencil
brush just mixing this color here with
the original warm brown color and just
buffing out that line so it's already
soft and smoky like so and then I think
with this look you can either go for
that dark brown liner in the waterline
but I like the look of the kind of
makeup that they do when they use more
of a white or a nude so this is the
sleek pencil in white noise and I'm just
gonna run that in my lower lash line got
just kind of opens up your eye bit more
and gives you more of that kind of it
doe eye effect then I'm gonna apply it
mascara now if you don't like wearing
false lashes but you want to still get
that Kardashian effect their lashes is
kind of almost an iconic factor that
they all have they've all got these
massively long lashes so you want to use
one that's going to give you loads of
volume I'm still going to use a mascara
that's going to give me loads of volume
anyway even though I am going to apply
falsies and this is the Maybelline lash
lash love my god the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara and this one's got
like the oil blend in it so it really
conditions your lashes and gives you a
really moosie thick volumed
lash so if you don't like false lashes
obviously you can just leave it there
but I'm gonna apply these lashes that
are like my go-to up whenever I wear
them you guys always ask me what they
are and they are odd l11 threes as you
can see there are like individual lashes
who stuck towards the end to make them
super wispy and kind of super Kardashian
esque so I'm gonna go ahead and apply
them and then we can move on to lips the
glue is still just drying slightly but I
am obsessed with just how wispy and full
these lashes are so I'm just gonna let
the glue driver as that's drying I'm
going to go on to the lips now the lips
are super minimal as well I'm just going
to be taking a lip liner this is the Too
Faced perfect nude lip liner and I'm
going to put that all over my lips and
line with it and then fill it in as well
if you like a matte lip you could just
leave it as that but I am a fan of a
glossy lip so I'm going to go ahead and
apply a bit of NARS gold Digga lip gloss
on the top and then that is the finished
look
so that is the finished makeup look I
