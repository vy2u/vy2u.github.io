today we are recreating this photo here
of Kylie Jenner which was a makeup by
Ariel when I first saw that photo I've
liked I was obsessed with the look it's
so sultry it's so glam but it's so is so
easy to do as you will see in this video
very kind of minimal eyeshadows to
create such a beautiful and effortless
look if you're liking the look of this
makeup already make sure to give this
video a thumbs up subscribe any of a

all of you for all your support I always
read through all your comments and I
love it being able to shout one of you
guys out if you're liking the look of
this makeup look like I said please make
sure to give it a thumbs up it really
really helps me just do it now it takes
two seconds done it okay good so without
further ado let's get on with the
tutorial
are you just loving out and my face is
right now been using you turn and turn
recently I love having a talent face
base that I'm ready to ace speaking of
an SBS Kylie skin literally looked
flawless when does it not so I'm gonna
use like my favorite products to create
a flawless base so for that I'm gonna
taking my iconic London a prep sit and
draw spray I'm just gonna use that kind
of really hydrate my skin give it a
little bit of a glory you know all of
that good stuff I'm using the original
one to do that just kind of hydrates the
skin gets it ready it for a shit-ton of
maple so my favorite products use
underneath foundation is the mac strobe
cream I like I'm obsessing with this
right now especially if I know I'm gonna
be wearing quite a heavy full coverage
almost matte finish foundation this just
kind of really helps to make it feel not
so heavy on the skin almost give a
little bit of glow through it throughout
the day I feel like this product is a
bit of a grower throughout the day in
terms of glow so it's like a grow glow
if that makes sense and I just love the
effect that this has on my skin
especially in conjunction with the next
product so the final step in terms of
priming our skin is a primer and I've
been really loving the combination of
the strobe cream and this this is the
NYX total control a drop primer really
reminds me of the Elias L or ours primer
essentially it just is like a really
milky base which seems to be a really
effective primer it lasts all day and in
conjunction like I keep saying with that
strobe cream gives a really gorgeous
look glowy finish but then also has
really good priming qualities and adds a
longevity to my maker which is obviously
what you want just going to be working
that in with a duo fiber brush this is
the signature fiber brush I love to
apply my kind of creamy products and
skin care with rushes as you guys know
just to make sure
it's kind of all works into the skin and
we are good to go so the foundation
we're gonna be using today and I've been
loving it so much recently is the hoola
beauty of photofiltre foundation just
feel like this gives the most epic
coverage and in combination with that
skin care I just find that my skin looks
like I filter like the best that it
could and I'm gonna buff it in with a
kind of duo brush think this one is the
BH Cosmetics brushing number four just
to kind of stipple it and to start with
get that initial coverage and just to
kind of work it and make sure you get ba
ba-ba just gonna initially disperse the
product make sure you get your ears and
then once I've done that I like to go in
with my Beauty Blender just to kind of
really reinforce the product like into
my skin make sure that there's none just
kind of sat there that may not have been
needed so therefore not blended and we
just want to make sure Preston getting
the best coverage that we can I just
find that way I get like the maximum
best looking coverage like so but I'm
now gonna go ahead and do my brows and
then we're going to move on to eyeshadow
so it's a little bit of a different
order not doing concealer or anything
yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and do my
eyebrows off-camera I've been doing them
at slightly differently recently as you
guys would have seen on my Instagram
stories if you're not following me on
Instagram make sure that you do yeah I'm
gonna go ahead and do them off-camera
but if you would like a full brow
routine a tutorial then let me know so
I've gone ahead and done one eye off
camera but like I said I've gone ahead
and done my brows as well the part we're
going to be using today is the morphe 15
d-day Slayer palette it's literally like
warm tone goals and hers is such a
warmer tone of blown-out smokey eye
hence why I was gonna do it because I
thought it was so sultry and so pretty
we also you can see doing our under eye
already as well normally I would wait
till I off to concealer but we're just
gonna go ahead and do like a full eyes
first so slightly different kind of
method of doing this technique so to
begin I'm gonna be mixing natural and
upbeat together on my a bigger fluffier
brush this is my blank canvas cosmetics
e 20 and just buffing it into the crease
and kind of the shape we are going for
it's like a blown-out but it will be
winged but we are going to clean that up
with concealer but we're just going to
be kind of trying to mimic that shape
going from inner to outer corner also
taking it quite high up on her brow bone
because she had taken it quite high so
just like so then on a slightly smaller
brush I'm going to be taking the shade
define and just work in that okay not
trying to go past that line there that's
what it's good to do your brows first
because then it kind of gives you
direction to kind of aim for and like an
angle to create this is actually such a
quick and simple buy routine because
it's all matte shades one palette it's
so simple but yet it looks so effortless
I'm just gonna take the shade editor but
on that same fluffy brush but just kind
of use the flat side of it just tap me
brush in and this is gonna be our lid
color so just packing that all over the
lid like so then on a Sun of more
defined a fluffy brush I'm gonna be
mixing the shades define that we just
use but also with that dark brown shade
at the bottom called
mouth just kind of tapping my brush a
couple of times and each and just kind
of creating that wing shape and really
just further defining the socket and
then going back in with your other
brushes you guys know just me ensure
just making sure is or you know I've
blended in it together a little bit more
of that dog brown shade just on the
outermost part of the eye now I'm gonna
be taking the morphia gel liner in a
coffee which is a really really dark
brown
and just creating a really little wing
across the lid and at the tiniest I'll
flip so just kind of starting halfway
across and create an the initial you
know line across I it doesn't matter if
you're not too too neat with this
because we are kind of gonna be buffing
and smoking it out cuz everything about
this was very kind of smoky they
probably actually it used a pencil to do
this and like I said just the tiniest
little wing which is kind of why I use
this brush this is a Mac two of eight
brush because it's a really small angle
something it's just gonna like press it
to create the size of wing I want
because it's gonna be super good II
literally just like that and then
dipping it this brush in to that mode
which the really dark brown this is
another BH Cosmetics brush number eight
just kind of really pressing on top of
that so it's not so obvious and that's
gonna really help to it smoke it out and
just look a lot more you know sultry so
I'm gonna go ahead and it tight line my
eyes and also in my waterline with a
dark brown pencil and this is the Marc
Jacobs high liner in brownie now she
definitely used more of a brown black
slash black but her eyes are a very deep
kind of hazely brown so she can really
kind of that really compliments her eyes
and she can get away with it on a
slightly lighter eyes i try and avoid to
use black and just use a very very dark
brown as a substitute i think it's a lot
more complimentary so yeah this is the
high liner by muck beauty in brownie
which I'm obsessed with for looks like
this so I'm just gonna walk tight line
my eye and then apply in my waterline as
well down with a pencil brush I'm gonna
take that define shade which was that
medium at Brown and just kind of connect
everything together you've kind of
smoked out that pencil and connect up to
the liner and then with a flat top brush
I'm going to take that move shade again
I'm just going to really push that in it
to the low
lashline and smoke that out with the
pencil brush just making sure it's all
connected so I'm gonna go ahead and also
highlight my inner corner and I'm just
gonna use the highlighter that I plan to
use which is from a doll beauty this is
the little palette this is their shine
bright shade which is a bit more like a
gold tone highlighter just to brighten
up our inner corners now we can just
apply mascara and lashes and these are
my favorite lashes ever if you love the
appearance of lash extensions you have
very fluttery flared out lash you guys
know that's like my favorite type of
style these lashes are gorge these are
the lashes from dull beauty Oh mind that
on me Neal from a dull Beauty in the
style Stephanie they come in a 3-pack
not with the same style but with two
other different ones that are both just
as gorgeous so I'm gonna go ahead and
apply these and show you the finished
eyes so these are the finished eye
obviously they're not cleaned up yet
with concealer but I'm obsessed with
them I think they're so effortless it's
so kind of like smoky and salty I mean
it probably has a different effect when
you've got brown eyes and you just look
like you've got chocolate buttons but
honestly I love this it's so easy and so
quick because now we can move on and
finish off the face okay so we're moving
on to concealer I'm going to take the
revolution conceal and define a
concealer now while doing this I'm gonna
make sure not to obviously take it all
the way up and just kind of go like that
and I'm gonna be using a brush to kind
of brush up the initial product so we
can be a little bit more precise with it
and just kind of do the same on this
side and just bring it down a little bit
like that but I'm just gonna be taking a
brush this is one of the morphe morphe
duo fibre brush I can't see an exact
name it's ones I like putting new ones
and just kind of start dragging it down
but kind of up and then we'll like move
our way up like so but then when it gets
to the wing
just kind of drag it out so we get more
of that precise angle and then I'm going
to be using my Beauty Blender to kind of
blend out the bottom so all kind of like
diffusers down but again I'm not using
my Beauty Blender like up underneath the
eye because I'm gonna go back in with
that morphe brush and kind of just do
like a side-to-side motion so it's all
blended out like so okay I'm gonna go
ahead and set everything in place with
powder I'm gonna be taking the makeup
revolution lace setting powder to kind
of help bake and set underneath my eye
so just gonna go ahead press that urn
and then bath the excess down you guys
know I'm not really like that in to a
baking anymore I just kind of like to
set everything in place make sure it's
not going nowhere not going to be doing
a cream contour today like a usually
word just because she didn't really have
much of a bronzing going on it was all
just kind of a little bit of a Khepera
to contour and more blush and highlight
if anything so we can go ahead and set
our face straight away but obviously I
want those Kylie cheekbones so I'm gonna
be taking at my nip and fab powder
contour kit and in the shade medium and
take this shade here which is called
warm ivory and I'm going to be taking
this brush from NYX Cosmetics it's like
my new favorite brush it's like a like
you know that NARS
eat a brush that was around ages ago I'm
gonna be taking this light shade here
because like I said it wasn't too
heavily contoured or to bronze so just a
light shade will do just kind of sculpt
out those high cheekbones oh just like
so and then go along your line and then
it's gonna go down my nose as well this
brush is really good for just really
quickly going down
I am just gonna give myself a little bit
of a bronze glow and for that I'm gonna
take the mac mineralize skinfinish in
gold deposit just sort of big fluffy
brush and just kind of dance that all
over just to kind of add a bit of like a
base glow you know I always say this I
just want a base glow nothing to like
that's like a highlighter I want it to
kind of be quite similar to my skin tone
but a little bit more bronzy just to
kind of give me that glow from within I
am loving this look already
well now recently I've been loving these
these are the two at face peach my
cheeks melting powder blushes - they're
actually a cream but they almost apply
like a powder finish but they give a
really gorgeous glow and her blush I was
definitely very noticeable and this is
in the color ginger peach so really
gorgeous kind of like apricot a peach
color you know I'm just taking a duo
fibre brush I'm just gonna smile and
stipple onto the cheeks these also smell
insane but I just love the look of them
I think they look so pretty
and finally for highlight you can
definitely see her glow I'm going to be
taking this kind of more golden color
from the doll Beauty palette they do
sell these individually which I've
linked down below this one is shine
bright and just apply that on my
cheekbones just above my brow Cupid's
bow and nose like so and finally it is
just time for lips now she'll definitely
had a very kind of peachy pink going on
so to get the kind of a fullness of
cardis lips like I'm gonna be lining
them very lightly at first with my spice
lip pencil how's that one there wasn't a
very kind of noticeable lip liner line
because hasn't actually full with like
filler and stuff but I want to achieve
the same look but without the filler so
we're going to be using a pencil
to do that like so and then the color I
have gone for is from a two-faced this
is their melted matte liquid lipstick in
sell out so I'm gonna go ahead and see
what this color looks like I feel like
that's a tiny bit to it dark I'm just
gonna lighten it slightly
this is morphe brushes brunch liquid
lipstick and I'm gonna apply that on top
I think that's much better so I think
this is the finished makeup look so this
is the finished makeup look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video give

her makeup has become iconic I'm
obsessed with doing them so I'll
