oh wow hey guys welcome back to my
channel so I changed and when the tiny
vacation at collection came out I did
purchase a few bits it was many because
it was such a good mood BAE's collection
and if you guys have followed me up for
a while you guys know one I love a nude
lipstick - I love a nude gloss and three
I freaking love highlighters so they
were actually kind of all the products
that I got so I got both of her glitter
glosses the nude matte lipstick set and
one of the loose powder highlighters as
well so in this video I do at swatch
them I test them out on my lips I test
out a combination on my lips as well and
I test out the highlighter wet and dry
and see what I think of them all I did
pay over $100 for all of them and then I
was having this custom because I am from
the UK so it's like another 30 like
dollars on top of that so overall I did
spend quite a bit of money on this
collection so I obviously wanted to test
out you guys and see if it's worth it in
case you I'd get hit with the same
customs and like I did so if you
want to see if I thought it was worth it
and keep on watching
okay feeling pretty bad right now
considering I have no highlighter on or
no and lips but that is because like I
kind of said in the intro the products
that I did pick up worth lip products
and I picked up one of these loose
glitter highlighters so I thought I'd
better kind of obviously use them and
live in action so the one that I got is
the shade of CG I think this is the
second two lightest one so let me show
you what it looks like so it comes in
like a little plastic pot like this
guide one thing I just really like I did
think that this packaging was a little
bit cheap and you can't really see like
the product inside it but here is a
close-up of it and I will do a swatch
for you now as well so I don't have any
point on a glittery just dipped my
finger in there once and this is
probably the product that I was the most
impressed with because it is super super
pigmented but I'm a loose glitter I
think you probably expect it to be quite
pigmented so it has all the thumbs up
from me at so far I love a loose guitar
litter I think they are the most intense
which is why I picked one of these up
rather than be like pressed part of one
I think it wasn't that skinny-dip duo I
definitely wanted to loose glitter like
I said this is the second time I cached
I saw on one side of my cheek I would do
it literally straight from here and then
on the other side I thought I would wet
it with six-plus and show you how
intense it can be there because with
loose powder highlighters that is a way
to make them put a lot more so I'm just
going to take the highlighter and this
is a matte 2g4 brush and that you just
going to dip the brush in and I'll have
about this much product on there now
this is going to be the size that I just
apply it as it is and I am going to just
tap a little bit of because I always do
that anyways but oh Lord
to me I feel like that's pretty good in
the sense that it doesn't really look
it's not very like the letter e even
though it looks like there is kind of
like glitter in it and I think when it's
not damp and just with one little bit it
gives a really gorgeous soft glow I
might go in with a second there and see
what that looks like
okay so if you like a really really
intense highlighter I this is definitely
intense like that for the second layer
and I can see that it literally it picks
up on the light so much I really like
the color as well I'm scared he was
going to be like to rose-gold the light
one was definitely two tails me and I
did try and get the darkest one just
because I love a bronze body glitter I
would have put that no more on my body
but I'm so glad I managed to hold
different positions actually really
pretty so these were actually $14 and I
feel like that's pretty good I thought
that's about 10 pounds in like English
money so for this I can't really tell
how much point you get I think it might
say let me look on the website hold on
so this is four grams of product so I
can't really do the maps but I feel like
that's quite good especially for like
that intensity and I feel like with
loose powders you barely need any anyway
so for $14 not too bad but now let's do
the other side and like let's wet the
brush and let's see how pigmented it is
then so again I'm just going to pick up
with a fair amount and then I'm going to
take my fix + spray give that a little
spray and a wolf drown and again do it
the same thing
so I think actually applying it we're
almost kind of created the same
intensity as like two layers I also feel
like it kind of molded it all a little
bit together and it blended a bit better
so I recommend maybe wearing your brush
while using it but now I'm really
impressive that I literally put
highlighter everywhere so let's just
take the remnants of what's on the brush
and just it around that no I think
that's a really pretty color
I'm never normally take some on my
Cupid's bow and down the bridge of my
nose I'm not wearing the brush this time
but just dusting it lightly what would
you guys think did you guys pick up any
of the loose powder ones and if you did
let me know how you get on because I'm
really liking it maybe you have it
slightly like textured skin they're not
going to be the Parkview but I feel like
if you have slightly smoother skin like
me and you're in the market for a new
highlighter $14 in too bad again I'm
guessing to pay the customs so it
depends I think this has been worth
connected okay I'm moving on it to a
knit product that is kind of like the
majority of what I got so I did pick up
the nude matte lipstick set now I think
the best way to do this I'll swatch each
color for you on my hand and then I'll
show you how they apply on it to lift
and the other two lip products I got are
the ultra glitter glosses so I thought I
would show you what these look like on
their own just like on top of nothing
and then at the end I will pick my prime
saver at lip combination and show you if
they work together if that makes sense
so I think because I don't want to like
a pigment pigment I don't wanna like die
my lips from the liquid lipstick I'm
going to go ahead and do the bosses
first I love a glittery dresser this was
like a must for me and the two colors
are glitz and glamour glamour is
definitely more like a bronze rose gold
and glitz is definitely more like an
iridescent tiny pink now these on her
Instagram I'm an adult insert picture
here swatch really pigmented Lee
glittery really basically they just a
super area I might even say it they
basically look like a proper proper
disorient blah so I was like oh my god I
need this because I love my lips look
like they're doubling so let me swatch
this is the color glitter so I've
dragged my hand in the product a few
times
I mean it definitely is glittery but it
feels really bitty I guess you can't
really expect much less if you want it
to be glittery but the color
pigmentation
isn't that like clear you can't make
sense but I mean this is the light of
one of the two so let's go ahead and
swatch glamour so this is more of the
rose gold color again I'm just going to
like give it a few pumps
if it means that just not what is this
like maybe I'm just too tired so this is
what they look like that is glamour
swatched next to it I did think it was
going to be a lot more of it like a
bronzy a color like thicker color payoff
but it really kind of is just like a
glitter top coat so now I'm going to go
ahead and bite my lips by I'm just gonna
I'm going to wipe the foundation off but
then I am just going like down over it
with my peach bender again today is a
little bit of a base but then difficult
I think on like my lips are really
naturally quite pigmented so to be able
to kind of see it properly I feel like I
need something there so I'm going to go
ahead and do that and then we can apply
the glosses okay so this is just like my
bare lips like I said and then I just
adapt them slightly with a Beauty
Blender so now I'm going to go ahead and
apply lip so like I said this is a
slightly lighter one of the two
okay so that's it with one layer oh well
so they actually feel a lot more
comfortable and I thought they would I
thought I'd be able to like feel the
bits if that makes sense but this is
super like intense I definitely think I
would prefer this over something you
know make sense so it's not just so
clear on my lips but like I said this is
the kind of glitz that is the light one
of the two but I really like it like I
think like I said this would look better
on top of something but I was like a
little girl it's like okay but it is
definitely more of a lip topper
I feel so these were slightly more
expensive than the kind of powder
glitter these worth $15 so just one
dollar more so I feel like that is kind
of around the 10 pound 11 pound mark so
for a really intensely like as you can
see do a gloss again I don't think
that's too bad
and I do quite like the color I think
this would look nicer over a darker nude
if you want to lighten it slightly or
something like that so I am a nude gloss
lover I am slightly favorable towards
these ones but let's try the other color
okay so again I have wiped it away and
now we can go ahead and apply the next
one so this one is the color glamour for
this one it's a slightly more rows of
gold one so I'm going to give it a
couple of pumps and apply okay so this
one definitely has more of a golden
bronze undertone which is kind of what I
thought anyway again it is super
comfortable it isn't what I thought I
did think it was going to be quite 50 on
the lip but I do prefer this color I
think it's slightly more of a warmer
tone this will kind of warm up like your
cooler tone at nudes and I do love a it
like a juicy pout and I feel that's kind
of the look that they give you so again
there's $15 as well it has kind of moved
a foundation I had underneath which I
kind of expected but I'm hoping it
doesn't do that if I apply it over
liquid lipstick so we're going to try on
a liquid lipstick and then I'm going to
pick my favorite two out of the
explosive and the nude lipstick and I
will see how they work together
okay please ignore how fun and if I have
just gone ahead and applied a lip line
let's just go back so I can see what
what the kind of color looks like with
it and this is how I would wear it for
the first one out of the set is the
lightest one and this one is called
naked so this is the color swatch I did
think that this one was going to be my
favorite as I am a light nude lover and
they smell amazing that is one thing
about her lip products that I do like is
the fact that they do it smell
incredible this like vanilla II like
sweets so let's see how this applies on
the lip
I'm just taking kind of one brush
strokes against the lightest one clip
naked
so I know this might be a superpower for
some people but I did do that
application with one kind of dip in the
brush so I am really impressed with the
pigmentation I do feel her lip products
improve every time something like that
is what a lot of people like to critique
about whether it's the brushes that it
comes with or the formula in general but
it does feel super comfortable I've only
had it on for about like 45 seconds and
I do feel like it has dried I used to
find that they kind of like transferred
a little bit or when you went like they
were just like a rubbery if that makes
sense you know some liquid lips its kind
of peel apart the more you like press
your lips together cuz they're like too
dry
I mean it is starting to crack a little
bit already and doodle I get will be one
of these liquid lipsticks that you do
have to kind of keep reapplying but
after the colorize I just got slightly
darker as it's like add and had time to
breathe but I do really like that color
like I said I do prefer the lighter news
what do you guys think it applied super
smoothly smells really good I think I'll
just have to test the longevity of it to
see how it works or how the glosses
apply on top but after the color I
really like it
I'm trying to I can keep my lip liner on
but the next color is called a birthday
suit I do like this one like you more
people's covers here it's a slightly
darker one so that one wasn't naked so
let's of sorts of birthday suit next to
em I feel like it's just a slightly
warmer toned nude which is kind of more
people's cup of tea and it's not as
light as that one so slightly more
wearable so I just dip the brush in it
once again I do think I slightly prefer
that color it is definitely more of like
the wearable and nude side of things but
still light as well and I do like the
warmer toned new just because that
complements my eyes and I do tend to
wear warmer tone to make up a lot more
but yeah the formula is still the same
it still feels exactly the same which is
always good because I know if some
people get like dud ones with insects
like this but now I definitely think
most people will prefer this kind of
color I feel like this would be a light
turn to news on would someone with
slightly darker skin so if you're more
of a
other skin you prefer a lighter news you
might said this one is a shame I Jenner
you can buy them individually you have
to buy them as a set because I know it
won't get as much wear out the darker
nudes as someone with dog skin would or
you prefer that darker color if I think
it was up to me I would have only bought
the first two shades of this set so in
that sense the money's not really worth
it for me but I am already going to
switch these two and try them on as well
and these and slightly Pinker colors
okay so the next I'm going to swatch is
the shade babe it definitely looks a lot
Pinker than the other two Frost like in
comparison so I'm going to go ahead and
do a swatch next from now so they are
the first two and then this one is babe
so yeah definitely a lot more of a rosy
pink don't buy a light pink so you like
a pinky nude then this one is probably
more for you as you can see that one's
definitely more cool tone and this one
is definitely not like a lighter like
brown and then yes isn't definitely
other thing for undertone to it so let's
see how the color looks on the lips
okay definitely not as pink as I thought
it was going to be I actually really
liked the color via if you definitely
before more of a pinky nude I think this
is really nice it's like a rosy a kind
of color but it's not too pink I
definitely do it there's warm undertones
to it so again this was the color babe
with all of the colors I am noticing
they are getting darker as they are on
the lip and when I look back at the
swatches they do appear darker as well
but no I think this would definitely
look stunning on people with any skin
color it's a really gorgeous midtone
pink
okay I'm presently surprised by Lakotas
I hate pink on me normally because I've
got blond hair blue eyes I don't look
like a Barbie doll by Dean Ornish look
sleepy yeah and it finally I think it is
the darkest color
I couldn't tell between this one and the
one before this one is called a
commander so let's watch it next to it
again I think it is more of the pinkier
under time but maybe funny over warmer
Brown I'm not sure we'll wait till it
dries and see but I do feel like this is
the slightly it darker one up all of
them so if you definitely have more of a
tan with far a darker nude again be to
like the bottom - I probably am
Orchestra now I'm looking at them on my
hand they are very very similar like a
very similar the only difference is
actually the one before looks more like
a cooler tone so Justin is definitely I
think more of a warmer time
okay so now it's applied on the lips
this is definitely more of like a dark
peach which is so confusing because in
their packaging they look so pink which
is what kind of put me off buying
themselves off I don't know well I'll go
for it just because I love a good nude
matte lipstick and she is the queen of
new they said actually always with a
nice nude lipstick on so they can't be
that bad but no this is definitely more
of a a dark peach I feel like this would
look better on someone with darker skin
tone as more of a nude then the other
things one I think this is the more of
like a warmer tone it'd be more
complementary then though okay just a
formula of them overall I feel like
don't do that all the same which is a
class is not one like better than the
other the brush is really easy to apply
and with all of them I only dipped my
brush in one side do you like they're
going to last in all the time the point
of that set was $45 which makes them
again just over the $10 mark each so
slightly cheaper than the lip glosses I
think so I do feel like after set that's
quite good value for money I do feel
like they are is are very dry now let
dry but after the colors I feel it okay
don't you think so I'm not really
disappointed in any of the colors from
that set which I was with when I ordered
the like the velvet ones I hate the
colors and then though they like to the
looks nice I do really like all of these
so identify I'm going to get my wear out
them so maybe it was worth paying that
extra bit okay so I do think my favorite
two did end up being the second two
lightest one which was birthday soon and
then be a glitz topcoat which was the
first one that we applied so I'm going
to go ahead and apply the liquid
lipstick and then that on top and I'm
going to see how they work together so
that is again a birthday suit color and
I am just going to wait till it dries so
I can give it like a fair chance and I
do like to highlight my Cupid's bow
which is kind of come off since the last
time I did it just to give it a little
better definition so like I said would
be they do dry quite quickly so I
thought that's pretty much dry so now
I'm going to go ahead and apply it da
glitter gloss in go in on the top
and just giving it that like a bite test
certified to see it like separates but
now that's wearing really comfortably I
thought this was going to be the vibe
make-or-break deal that like it all
starts to peel off and stuff but that
might come with time that I'll get about
it at the doll maybe because it's Carrie
Lanka that they work well together that
does tend to be what it like with most
brands no it's not like my favorite nude
combo of all time but like of all the
products I had I really liked it I think
it looks free you might disagree but I
do love it like nude so that was it the
