as you can tell by the title today's
video it's at Kendall Jenner inspired
makeup look inspired by this picture
here so it's like a really white silvery
eye and golden lip and really peachy
flawless skin so if you like to look at
this makeup lips and please give up
China starting off with my base and
eyebrows done
I used my Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation in the shade 6.5 and my
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow at
medium brown and the brow wiz then she
had really highlighted under eyes so I'm
using the NARS radiant creamy concealer
in the shade Chantilly I think it's
their lightest one and placing that
really quite heavily underneath my eyes
down my chin Cupid's bow nose the usual
spot and then blending it out with my
nan Chi sponge and making sure that it's
damp so it absorbs any of the excess
product so we're not placing too much
down underneath the eyes
I'm then gonna be baking it the
concealer that we placed underneath the
eyes and everywhere else just because I
feel like this as it's an inspired Jenna
makeup tutorial this is a technique that
I've seen them use a lot and basically
really it makes your under eyes a lot
brighter and a lot more flawless and
matte so I'm gonna be doing that while
that is baking I'm gonna be lightly
bronzing at the outskirts of my face and
cheeks using my Chanel shuttle saleh de
tan product which basically is a
brilliant light bronzing cream and yeah
she didn't really have a lot of bronzer
in the picture that I saw so this I
thought would be a nice product to use
here then I'm just wiping away the
excess powder and from the picture she
had a really nice peachy blush on so I'm
gonna be taking this so either
coral spectrum palette and just the
second lightest shade I think is and
using my Sigma blusher brush to apply
that
her highlight wasn't exactly dramatic or
anything like that so I decided to use
mary-lou manizer by the balm to tie in
with the eyes that we were gonna do if
this is more like a silvery pearl
finished highlighter and I'm just
applying that he's my morphe fan brush
the tops of my cheek right and she had
quite a heavily highlighted Cupid's bow
and no so I'm just doing that as well so
as you can see the skin is really light
and soft and now moving on to the eye
makeup I'm going to be using this next
jumbo stick in the shade cottage cheese
with cottage cheese which is essentially
just like a pearlized white cream shadow
stick just applying that all over my lid
as a base then taking it there's a
waiver on taupe palette and mixing the
two paler shades one of them's more of a
matte cream shade the other ones more of
a silvery sparkly shade I mix them
together and placing that all over the
lid essentially to set that in place and
also just to really intensify the
brightness of the lid shade I'm just
using a flat brush to do that she didn't
really have a lot in her crease so this
is why this palettes really good because
the matte shades in it are really it's
soft and subtle so I'm taking this soft
movia toned shade on the Sigma e-40 and
just softly blending that into my socket
and then taking this gracious lightly
more precise fluffy brush and again just
using that deepen up the socket that's
the only two shades I'm gonna be using
because like I said in the picture it
didn't really look like she had a very
intense so get shade going on so these
two colors together I thought would just
add a bit of de más de mention and it
depth without it just being a completely
flat color on the lid then I'm taking it
this pigment from Illamasqua in the
shade because I think it is spraying my
eyes with fix+ first two acts as to act
as an adhesive and then pressing it over
the top I normally would do this if it
was like a reflex glitter and it kind of
is even though it says it's a pigment I
do find that it is more of a glitter to
this it's just gonna add to the
intensity and the sparkle and I'm then
just highlighting my inner corners with
the same matte shade from the palette
and also my brow bone
Kendal's lashes looked brilliant wispy
on the outer corner so I'm guessing her
makeup artist might have maybe used
individuals for this but I literally
suck at applying individuals so I am
using these Doha lashes from Lily lashes
and I'm absolutely in love with them
they're super wispy and pretty easy to
wear without eyeliner which is why I
love them so much as it was really nude
and golden so I'm taking the etc
lipliner from Mac and then this lipstick
meet on board in the shade vanilla suede
which is really quite pale so I'm going
back in with the pencil just to make
sure it's all blended out and even then
applying it this lip gloss from
Anastasia Beverly Hills in the shade
gilded to add that kind of golden
sparkle finish and that is the finished
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did

comments below for inspired looks and
until the next video I will see you soon
