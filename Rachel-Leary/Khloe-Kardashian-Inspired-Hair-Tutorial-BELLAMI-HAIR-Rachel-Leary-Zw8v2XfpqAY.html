today I'm gonna be doing a actually
think it might be one of the first hair
tutorials I've done on my channel I saw
this recent picture of Khloe
Kardashian's hair and it's such sucker
popular hair so at the moment like it's
definitely a go-to hairstyle for me and
she had such amazing length and volume
and such beachy curls and it looked
super kind of fun and easy to do so I
thought I would recreate it for you guys
so to make sure I'm getting the same
sort of length and volume that she has
I'm going to be using hair extensions in
this video and these ones are from
Bellamy I knew this was the look that I
wanted to recreate because you have such
length and volume and that is kind of
what you get from these four hair
extensions so this is the box that they
come in and I'll show you what you get
inside so you get this really a handy
detangler so this is perfect for
brushing your hair brushing through the
extensions make sure that it looks super
smooth and you can use it to help you
separate and backcomb as well and then
these are the extensions that I have
mine are in the color balayage chocolate
brown - dirty blonde because I do have
darker roots and they are 220 grams and
it's a 22 inch set in and I think the
color number is actually 418 so as you
can see these are all the pieces that
you get it does come with a tester piece
first and I do recommend obviously if
you will not 100% sure on the color
trying it out with the tester piece
first cuz they can't be returned once
the main bit is opened so like I said
this is the 220 gram at 22 inch set and
it comes with two wess with four clips
two weft with three Clips one left with
two clips and four Wes with just one
individual one so you're going to get so
much length and so much volume from this
it's their Bellamy effect and I do have
a discount code for you guys to actually
save money off these hair extensions and
it's just Rach Larry and I'll leave the
link to that down below also because
she's got that really gorgeous beachy
wave going on I'm going to be curling my
hair and the extensions as well and to
do this I'm going to use
the Abela me at 6 in-1 curling sets
you've got such a range of ones to
choose from to achieve the one that you
are one so here is the close-up of
what's inside the box so you've got the
six ones and the safety glove to make
sure that you're protecting your hands
and you don't burn them so from left to
right we've got the 32 at millimetre
wand the 25 millimeter wand the 25
millimeter that kind of goes down at an
angle into more of an 18 millimeter the
19 millimeter that's the same length the
whole way down and then one that goes
from thin from it thin to thicker and it
is 9 millimeters to 18 millimeter and
then we've got the pearl wand that gives
you more of that kind of crimped look
today I'm going to be using the biggest
barrel which is the thirty two
millimeter wand to achieve that kind of
thicker
each year curl and I do have a discount
code for the colors as well which is
rate 160 and that saves you one hundred
and sixty dollars off of the set so I'll
leave a link to that down below because
that is crazy good yeah without further
ado let's get on with the video
so first things first I am just going to
a brush through my hair obviously
without the extensions in and then I am
going to separate them because I
actually like to curl my own hair first
before I cut the extensions and then I
kind of just curl the extensions into my
head that makes sense so just separating
my hair and then taking the six in one
color and like I said using the thirty
two millimeter wand making sure I'm
wearing the glove so I don't burn my
hand I am just taking a medium sized
pieces and just curling them in an
outwards motion to get that kind of
thicker curl and the beach here effect
once I have done it the first layer it's
just a process just keep repeating so
I'm just taking down another
medium-sized layer and then again just
keep taking it medium-sized pieces as
well and just yet keep continuing to
curl them and in outwards motion
once you finished curling your own hair
it should look something like this and
now I'm going to take the extensions I'm
going to take this the first set of
three clipped ones and just use this at
the very very bottom of my hair so just
tying up a massive chunk of my hair and
then back combing using the Bellamy
brush that it comes with just to help
the extensions to grip a lot easier I
find that makes it so much easier for
them to clip in and yet as you can see
super easy and I'm just making sure if I
want to apply all my extensions
I'm leaving hair between them but not
too much otherwise I'm going to I'm
going to end up running out of hair so
again just repeating this process and
now I am taking the full clip one just
because this is a slightly wider part of
my head so it can fit and yeah like I
said just keep repeating the process
however before we run out of hair we
want to make sure we have enough to do
the top knot so I'm just taking the top
most part of my hair which is kind of
like your fringe bits and just brushing
it back and then just really holding the
base and then twirling it and then just
twirling it into a bun it's super super
easy to do back combing it a bit might
actually help as well to give it a bit
of grip and a bit of volume but just
tying it round into a kind of top knot
and then applying a hair tied to lock it
in place
and then just kind of filling about like
stretching it out pulling bits out until
you're happy with what it looks like
then repeating the process with the same
clips again and then I'm taking the two
clip set and applying that to the crown
of my head just because that's where you
kind of have the less look you have less
amount of hair so you still want to be
able to hide it so it's the perfect size
just for the crown and then at the sides
to give the length and the volume I'm
just applying the single clips because
like I said they're easiest to hide so
they are safe kind of in that part of
your head I feel like I'm really
rambling but you get the drift this is
what the extensions look like all in
obviously they're not cold yet but that
is what we're gonna do now like I said I
personally find it easier to curl the
extensions after that in my head I mean
you can totally carve them before and
then apply but I just like to curl them
into my hair so again just doing the
same motion I was doing with my own hair
in an outwards motion to get that
b:g effect
so this is the finished look I really
hope you guys like it I'm in love with
kind of loose beachy ways and the kind
of top not half-up half-down look so I
definitely wanted to get this look up
you guys and show you how easy it is to
do it with extensions and curling them
like I said I've got discount codes for
both the hair extensions and the hot
tools that I've used and I will link
them they should just be in the top bit
of the description bar down below so

information about which extensions I've
used as well like the color and the
length and the weight of them is all in
