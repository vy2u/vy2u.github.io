so today I have done another inspired
look I am obsessed inspired looked on my
channel if you're new there kind of like
one of my favorite looks to do this one
is from a recent picture
I sort of Khloe Kardashian on her
Instagram she is staying at the moment
there were so many to choose from I did
ask you guys if you wanted between like
these two pictures one was more like a
silvery smokey eye and like a straight
hair look and the along was more of a
bronze beatnik and of course because you
guys are like me you guys preferred the
bronze and beachy look so sorry do you
think this is kind of similar to a love
looks are you already do on my channel
bit it's a bit more of a pinky lip and
the way that I've done my eye makeup is
slightly different and the lashes are
kind of a bit more different for me
they're bit more spiky like the ones
that end at her picture and I use loads
of different products so pick and choose
what you will from this I really guys
enjoy this tutorial this is also a
makeup and hair tutorial so I'll show
you how to get this hair look as well
that is obviously more towards the end
of the video make sure to give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoy it at the
end and for more inspired lips in the
future and let me know in the comments
down below and you do when I see the
other Chloe that I should look I know
loads of you did but no it's too is too
much to do too much Chloe is there
actually too much climate I don't know
yeah I believe you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and let's get started
to start off with I'm just clipping my
hair out of the way so we can have a
clear face and we're just going to prime
our skin using the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi highlighter and I'm mixing it with
my two-faced hangover X primer I love
the way that this makes my skin look
because if you like me and you fake tan
your body not necessarily your face this
just adds a little bit of color
underneath your makeup and it gives such
a gorgeous glow to the skin I'm obsessed
so I'm blending it in with my expert
face brush I think this is as always for
foundation I'm using the Loreal
infallible Pro matte foundation in the
shade - Oh a I've linked down below a
website that stocks this foundation as
in the American version if you're from
the UK so definitely make sure to look
there because I was trying to link it
for you guys and I was like oh man would
they don't do this shade but I've linked
it down below so hopefully you'll be
able to get your hands on it if you
think you're a similar color to me but
concealer I'm it taking me concealer
spectrum palette from zoeva and mixing
it these two colors together to really
brighten up underneath my eye in the
picture of Chloe she definitely had a
really really bright under-eye and kind
of center of the face so I'm using a
creams to do that and I'm just passing
on it with a brush this is from Sephora
I think it's the number 57 or 59 or
something like that it's called like the
pro airbrush concealer brush or
something like that and I'm just
applying that underneath my eyes and
then on my chin and on my forehead as
well but because it's a cream and they
can be quite thick I am going to be
going in with my Beauty Blender to blend
it out and I haven't cleaned it anything
since applying my foundation just
because I I find it blends a lot easier
and a bit more kind of subtly not so
intensely that's kind of what I mean if
there is a bit of foundation left on it
I think it blends it all together really
nicely
then I'm taking the Too Faced Born This
Way conceal it in the shade deep and I'm
using it as a cream at contour Chloe in
these pictures was a very varied hand so
obviously adjust the colors to what suit
your skin not necessarily have to go as
dark as this and I'm just blending it in
it with a duo fiber brush in a upwards
motion to create the appearance of
higher cheekbones and then obviously I'm
blending in on my forehead as well to
give the appearance of a smaller
forehead and just kind of a warm up my
skin and make me appear a bit more
bronzed nearly as buns as Chloe then I'm
just going in with my Beauty Blender as
well to blend out my nose contour and
just make sure it's all blended into my
foundation and there is no harsh lines
and it's all super super blended the key
is blending then I'm taking my RC lino
color powder there's no shock there and
I'm just using that to bake underneath
my eyes with and then what's left on the
brush I'm just gonna use that and dab
that all over the rest of my face just
because I don't necessarily want to
brighten up the rest of my face but this
powder is absolutely incredible for just
setting your makeup without any color
and just mattifying your skin and giving
you like a completely airbrushed look
because we cream contoured I didn't want
my bronzer to be anything it's too
intense so I'm just going in with a big
fluffy face brush and this is the mac
mineralize skinfinish in global glow
it's just going to add a bit more wants
to my skin but give me a bit more of
like a highlighted finish as well
speaking of which I'm going in with a
mineral blush this is from neve
cosmetics in the color urban fairy I
recently just kind of was going through
my collection of the day and found this
and I'm absolutely obsessed with it if
the ogor just rose at gold color and
because it's a mineral one it has a glow
and sparkle to it which I'm really
really liking at the moment I seem to be
getting into kind of like summery makeup
just as it's coming to an end but oh my
god I'm so so so excited with this this
is the Cleopatra's kiss sleek
highlighting palette if you saw it on my
snapchat you know this is absolute
incredible and I'm just taking this
shade here as you can see it is so
intense this is a bit more bronzy than
their infamous solstice highlighting
palette so it is definitely more up my
street and I'm just using a a multi
brush to apply this to the tops of my
cheekbones then it just might Cupid's
bow and down the bridge of my nose with
skin finished I'm just going to go ahead
and do it my eyebrows I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz in soft
Brown and setting that in place with the
Maybelline a brow precise in a deep
brunette for a bit more of a softer
fluffier brow then I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills world traveler
palette and going in with the soft peach
shade in the actual picture makeup by
Mario uses his own Anastasia palette so
I thought I would stick with the theme
and just stick with Anastasia Beverly
Hills shadows I don't think you can get
this palette anymore but I have listed
all the shades that I've used it down
below which I think you can buy
individually but I'm now just going in
with Morocco on a fluffy brush just to
further define at the crease and blend
into that soft peach color then I am it
using blini on the lid as she definitely
had something soft and shimmery and I
was looking at close-ups as the makeup
by Mario palette and there were a few
gold shimmers in there and this one was
definitely similar now I'm just going
back in with a fluffy brush and just
making sure it's or softly blend it out
we do want to keep this quite rounded
but it is kind of more of like a
blown-out smokey eye then I'm mixing
Morocco and fudge together and also and
I'm also I'm kind of just patting this
onto the outer part of my eye and then
going back in with a different fluffy
brush and blending it together just so I
can get
of a color and more intense then I'm
using my NYC liquid liner and I'm just
going across the lid there's no wing or
anything like that so this is super
super easy and I think when you put
lashes on and you've blended it out with
your other eyeshadows it is really
effective just to hide the lash band
then I'm going in with a black eye
shadow this is just noir on a really
small flat shader brush and I'm just
pressing this into my outer most part of
the eye as you can see I'm just kind of
merging the eyeliner into the eyeshadow
in a more softer way and just blending
it out with a fluffy brush I'm pretty
sure I picked up a couple of the like
maracas and fudge shades on it just to
make the transition a lot easier for
myself then I'm using this intense rose
color on my lower lash line I'm pretty
sure she probably used something similar
in her crease but it did look really
pink and I wanted to do something a bit
different so I'm just running that along
my lower lash line with a pencil brush
then I'm taking that fudge color on a
flat definer brush and really pressing
that into my lash line just to give it a
bit more definition and then blending it
all out using the Morocco color on a
different pencil brush it seems like a
lot of steps but obviously you can take
what you want from it and you may not
want to use all of those colors but that
is the finished eye look so I'm now just
going ahead and applying mascara and
these are the lashes I'm using they are
from false lashes UK they are the are
dealt develops in 206 super spiky and
really wispy I'm in love with them and
they're synthetic as well now if the lip
she definitely had a brown liner going
on so I'm going in with this Rose Brown
NYX lip liner and then I'm going in with
creme de nude from Mac because I really
wanted a light base it was definitely
more of a peachy lip and I know is not
this kind of color but like I said I
wanted to give myself a light base
because I had a really coral lipstick
but it was too intense too wet on its
own so I'm using this is kind of like
the bottom up color and then this is the
lipstick I'm using it is from sleek I've
listed all the products in the name of
this down below I'm just taking a bit on
the center of my lip and then dabbing it
in it with my finger to create my own
custom shade
so this is the finished makeup look a
really a pretty a peachy lip and bronzy
beachy skin and obviously I'd really not
to it complicated but I think a really
nice smokey eye now on to the hair I
actually did sleep with my hair and I
pull out the night before coincidentally
but this but here I'm just kind of
brushing out the curls that I got from
that to make it a bit easier for myself
and if you're like me and have naturally
frizzy hair these baby hairs always are
just so so so frizzy for me so I'm just
going in with my straightener
to start with and just straightening it
those bits out just the front bits
because in the picture of Chloe she had
really snatched edges so I definitely
wanted to achieve the same look now I am
at taking my Bellamy curling wand I've
listed it down below I think it's at the
25 millimeter one so a bit smaller than
I normally would and I'm just going in
and kind of curling the bits I kind of
brushed out my hair did hold its curl
after the Platt but so it's something
like this and then i'm just literally
running my fingers through it i use a
smaller one so we'd get kind of more
beachy curls when i brush it out and
then I'm taking this pur made from
bumble and bumble which essentially just
kind of really helps with humidity so it
was going to get rid of any of my frizzy
bit so I really concentrate this at the
front of my hair where I normally get
frizzy and to kind of help control the
curls like so and then finally I'm
taking the away wave
spray and just spraying that all of my
hair and kind of using a crunching
motion to create a beachy look so this
is the finished look I really hope you
