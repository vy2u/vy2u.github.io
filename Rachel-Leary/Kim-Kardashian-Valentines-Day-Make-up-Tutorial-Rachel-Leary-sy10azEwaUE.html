today I film a makeup tutorial based on
some of the products I bought today I
went to the on a makeup shop for a few
things but oh speaking of which I wasn't
fooling about this new website actually
denim is new but um it's called Opinion
Outpost calm and basically you get paid
for your opinion in like things that you
actually want so like a cash or iTunes
now just under matches or you know like
stuff that you'd actually bought it all
it is it's like filling out an opinion
based survey and things are relevant to
you so look about Disney or movies and
stuff like that I thought I was quite
gorgeous an easy way to earn money so
I'll link and below because so many
people are in the same situation as me
and a little extra cash doesn't hurt
anyone so if you're interested I will
link them in the description bar below
but today based on things like or which
were the Makeup Forever HD foundation
and I got some below lashes as well
based on that I thought I would do a Kim
Kardashian inspired Valentine's Day
makeup considering is on Saturday it's
really natural the lashes are quite like
flirty and voluminous which is the only
really romantic thing about this look
there's no way or anything so it's super
easy to do as well so I hope you enjoy
and I hope you guys have a wonderful day
on Saturday whatever you're doing we
hope you guys enjoy this look please
give it a like and subscribe and share
we'll do whatever you want to do and
leave in the comments any more videos
that you want to see I'm gonna be
posting a lot more I've got my half term
coming up so you can be posting a lot
more so leave her comments down below
things that you want to see and yeah I
hope you enjoy and if you like this look
please keep watching so to begin I'm
using my Victoria's Secret airbrush
primer just around my nose and in the
places on my face that I feel like need
a bit of smoothing out then using my new
Make Up For Ever HD foundation and a
Beauty Blender this is in the shade 1 to
7 I'm gonna just be stippling it onto my
face and seeing some of the comments in
my previous video yes my foundation is
darker than my face that is because I
fake tan I thought it was obvious but
obviously it's not anyway moving on to
eyebrows I'm using the HD brow palette
and using the second to lightest shade
there it and then to highlight my brow
bone I'm using this sleek pencil I'm not
sure on the shade but obviously it's
just the white one and you see me
getting it I'm just using this under my
brow and then blending it downwards
and using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
I'm just applying this all over my lid
and then blending out with my finger
using a Mac two to four brush and creme
brulee from makeup geek
I'm just buffing this pass that into my
crease and having my brush on a more
it's like gonna be pointing downwards so
the bristles are kind of blending it
upwards and that makes sense and I just
feel like that gives it a more seamless
blended look using another Mac brush
this is the 207 I'm going in with latte
from makeup geek and just doing the same
motion but a bit further down and then
going back in with my Tootsie for to
blend it out after the lid Kim kept it
pretty neutral and shimmery and I think
this is super pretty
Valentine's Day so I'm going into the
natural Zee it's like big all mineralize
eyeshadow joy from Mac and then pressing
the New Year's Eve pigment from makeup
geek on the top to get that really
pretty so here I'm just using as a way
the crease brush and the same shade
Barcelona Beach from makeup geek just to
further deepen the crease and blend out
and again like before going in with my
tg4 to blend out
so my favorite part about this look is
the fact that she didn't have a wind
liner so this is why it's super quick
and easy to do and it can take minimal
effort I'm just using a gel liner for
this that you can use whatever you want
I'm using the Mac tube pen brush I do go
over it with the NYC liquid liner just
to create a really smooth finish but
yeah it took literally no time it's also
if you're in a rush just finish work or
something then you quickly going out for
dinner you know that you're going to get
a really nice look with this and it's
going to take a minimal effort just for
the main feature of this look like him
so I'm using the girl you crazy lash
member villu lashes and I love them now
to highlight and contour I'm using
Makeup Forever HD foundation again but
this time in the shade one one seven so
a few shades lighter and then using my
new Mac color correcting duo and using
the 3d pale yellow side to highlight and
then buffing it out with my Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge
from the photo it didn't look like she
had a really heavy control which is why
I'm using cream and this is the next
concealer in nutmeg
I'm just really lightly applying a
really minimal amount to my cheeks and
the tops of my forehead and down the
sides of my nose just to create a
natural contour just because Kim is
always contoured no matter what look
she's doing but blusher is the main
feature as you'll soon see in a bit to
set my face I'm using the Anastasia
banana shade and they're actually to set
the highlighted areas I'm using the
Anastasia banana shade and set the rest
of my face I'm using the matte Kerr
blender powder in medium
now this palette by nas was so perfect
for this look because it contained like
it has a bronzer and it had a really
pretty champagne and most importantly it
has this really pale pink blush a shade
which is exactly the kind of shade that
Kim had in the picture that I saw so I
just used this I'm using the bronzer to
set the cream contouring that we had
earlier using the really pale blush just
on the tops of my cheeks and then using
the highlight to create a really pretty
glow for Kim's lips she kept it pretty
pale but quite glossy so I'm using
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in pure Hollywood with MAC Cosmetics
dazzle glass and sugar rim my eyes I
just went back in with Barcelona Beach
and applied some bottom lash mascara and
that's it I really hope you guys liked
it as you can see it was super easy and
quick so I hope you guys have an amazing
Valentine's Day and I'll see you in the
next video bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
