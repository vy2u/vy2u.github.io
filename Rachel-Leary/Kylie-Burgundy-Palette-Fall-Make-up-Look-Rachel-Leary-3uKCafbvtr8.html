recently got my hands on the new Kylie
cosmetics burgundy eyeshadow palette and
I opened it up if you guys have seen
picture this already you guys know it's
absolutely gorgeous and perfect for this
kind of autumnal time of year so I
wanted to create a look for you guys I
didn't just want to do that kind of like
dark smoky eye that I kind of always do
I didn't want to do something a bit
different I still wanted to be wearable
though and still come to my taste so I
do this kind of all matte look and I use
another one of cardies products I use
her love bite lipstick as a eyeliner to
kind of complement the eyeshadows as
well so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this look if you did make sure to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe if you
haven't already and let's go ahead and
get started so typically we're going to
start fresh face and we're gonna
moisturize our skin it this is the
Garnier a moisture bomb moisturize I've
been obsessed at this moment but we are
going to do our eyes first but this just
allows it time to sink into the skin for
eye primer I'm just going to use the
concealer that I plan to use on my face
which is the morphe concealer in the
shade sand and I'm just buffing this all
over my eyelid on a morphe gunmetal
brush I'm not 100% sure on which one but
then I'm just going ahead and setting
that just with powder so our eye shadows
will blend a lot easier on our eyes fine
shadow today we're using the acai deep
burgundy palette and obsessed with this
at the moment and I'm just taking this
warm brown shade as our initial
transition color on a Mac 2 to 4 brush
just to start off the smoky eye and it's
going to go from light to dark as always
in the crease but this is such a
gorgeous color it's super warm and
really it brings out kind of bluey green
eyes then going for the slightly darker
shade I think this one is called brick I
have named all the colors down below
just on a slightly smaller fluffy brush
I am just pricing this in the crease as
well just slightly lower where we placed
that original color so the transition
goes yeah like I said from light to dark
then going back in with that two to four
again not with any excess product on the
brush but just to make sure that
everything is really it nicely blended
together for our lid color we are using
this shade here on a flat brush the
matte shades are so so so pigmented I
was so impressed with the pigmentation
when I use this and yeah just using this
all over our lid because I wanted this
to be an all matte smoky eye
then I'm just going back in with that
smaller fluffy brush again just
reversing each step like I do each time
just making sure everything is all
abundant together I find this to be the
most effective way to get that light to
dark gradient the kind of most diffused
and blended together as possible then I
am taking this dark brown shade and just
concentrating this on the outermost part
of our eye just to add a bit of depth to
the crease then again going back in with
our fluffy brushes to make sure it's all
blended together and there is no harsh
lines then I'm at taking this farm
pigment it's called at no money no honey
just for a really gorgeous champagne
shimmery oh god don't want to describe
it any more in a corner highlight then
using a wipe I am just going to clean up
any of the mess that we made to create
that winged out shape to give us a
really good base where when we do our
liquid liner the liquid eyeliner I am at
taking the Kylie cosmetics liquid
lipstick in the shade
super similar and complimentary to the
colors that we've used on our eyes and
something a little bit different you
could obviously just use black or like a
really dark brown either of those I
think we look really pretty with this
look but I just thought this was a
really nice color for a liquid eyeliner
so just going ahead and applying it how
I would normally apply like a gel liner
I use a small eyeliner brush with a
little angle which made it super easier
to get that sharp points then for lashes
these are from valor I will leave the
name of them at down below and they're
super winged out and fluffy I thought
they were super complimentary it for
this look going back to the skin I am
taking the makeup for ever step on
smoothing primer and mixing it with this
new product from lore'l it is there
liquid glow in the shade golden glow
I've been obsessed with mixing liquid
illuminators with my primer just because
it gives me a little a little bit more
color to my skin and it helps match my
tan and gives me a really nice glow up
from within from when I apply it
foundation on the top and I've been
really liking the makeup forever
smoothing primer at the moment I've been
just liking smoothing primers in it
general I think it makes my foundation
apply a lot easier and the foundations
I'm using today are two shades of the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
6.5 and 7 just because I think this
gives me a much more natural color
they can range from kind of pinky to
greeny undertone so mixing them together
it gives me a really good color then
using the same morphe concealer that we
used for our eye primer like I said this
is in the shade sand I was kind of
feeling quite a bright under-eye so this
is quite a lot lighter than my natural
skin tone but obviously once you apply
the rest of your other face products it
kind of balances out type thing so I'm
just using a damp Beauty blender to
blend that all into my skin
I then just set that in place with
powder and did my eyebrows using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is and this
brow pen I've been loving using at the
moment it gives it a bit more of a
natural look then taking that darker
shade from the Kylie cosmetics palette
just running that along my lower lash
line just because I kind of wanted this
to be quite a dark intense matte smokey
eye so I went for the darkest color that
I used you can use any of the warm matte
colors I think they look super super
pretty and then I just applied a bottom
lash mascara and this is the finished
eyes back onto the skin I am it using a
benefit hoola bronzer just to warm up
the perimeters of my face and give a bit
more definition to my cheeks and my jaw
and all that good stuff and then for
blush i'm taking this nyx sweet cheeks
palette and this peachy shade which I'm
obsessed with at the moment this palette
is so so pretty if you can get your
hands on it definitely do it
it's so good for traveling as well and
the colors if you're like me and don't
like a massive amount of blush they're
really complementary and then for
highlighter I thought I'd multi use the
products that I've already used and I'm
just taking some of that farm pigment on
a multi brush and just applying that to
the tops of my cheekbones and then my
Cupid's bow and the edge of my nose just
all the places that I like to bring it
forward
for lips I wanted to go for kind of like
a burgundy toned nude if that makes
sense you could totally use the card
equals medics love white lipstick if you
wanted that as well but I thought the
eyes were kind of dark and dramatic
enough so I went for a purpley nude and
this is a stripped-down pencil from Mac
and then this is the liquid lipstick
from Gerard cosmetics in the color
skinny dip so this is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it make sure to give it a thumbs
up if you did and subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in
the next one bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
