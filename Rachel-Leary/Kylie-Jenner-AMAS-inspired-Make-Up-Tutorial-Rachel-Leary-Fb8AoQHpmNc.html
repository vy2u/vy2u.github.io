inspired makeup look based on what she
looked like after the AMAs so I already
prepped my skin and then foundation I
know that Jenna and Kardashian's are a
fan of the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
but I was kind of running out so I mixed
it with my Kat Von D foundation on a
mixing tray painted onto my face and
then buffed it out with around a brush
from eBay
then from eyebrows I used maca from
makeup geek to fill out the outer third
with a flat definer brush from bdellium
tools then filled in my inner set of the
Kiko brow pencil for a natural kind of
gradient effect then as usual sculpt out
my brows of the practice sealer to Pat
my lids I used my soft ochre Paint Pot
and said it with a matte bone shadow so
blending the shadows on top of it much
easier to do
the initial transition shade are you
speaks in green from makeup geek and
buff it into my crease
then too deep in my crease I use the
mayor mayor palette from Anastasia and
softly blend that into my crease a bit
lower than the initial shade so it all
kind of becomes a green
then using my bomb by OSH palette from
the bomb I'm taking a darker background
following the gradient so again placing
it slightly lower and then blending it
out
then I'm just following the same steps
again at this time just cool it
taking any matte white eyeshadow I'm
tracing this all over the leg as it
looked as if she barely had anything on
her lids so I'm just placing this onto
the areas of the nose shadow and
exceeding enough then to highlight the
inner corner I'm taking this champagne
shimmery shade and using a pencil brush
carefully placing into the inner corner
and also taking onto the lower lash line
for a step further on in the video then
onto the face using my wire cell to
shakaar to highlight under my eyes
forehead chin you know the usual places
and then just using the brush to define
my eye shadow to make it look sharp and
a bit more put together and I'm using my
Real Techniques foundation brush for
this
to set that in place using the banana
shapes and the Anastasia contour palette
with my another blank canvas tapered
highlighter brush I will leave a link to
their website down below
then that's our gimme some cheekbones
I'm using the Too Faced chocolate buns
are to create the illusion of shadows
and women like complexion
Kylie's cheeks are kind of very minimal
so I'm keeping a fairly basic
to give myself a little bit of a
highlight I'm using Mac soft and gentle
pretty sparingly as up they seem to
mostly mat heads using or matte
eyeshadows as well
from close-ups of photos it looked as if
her makeup artist had extended her lower
lashline
from taking an angled brush and a matte
brown shade and I'm just going unto the
highlight I brought down onto the lower
lash line earlier and extend it towards
the inner corner I then buff out that
line with makeup the creme brulee just
to smoke out there
wearing any Linus and moving straight
onto mascara so just with my style this
looks like this the confidence ii like
that so that's really pretty I like
everyday but because this is an inspired
look I wanted some really wispy kylie
inspired lashes so I used my red train
I'm at 43 the lips I used my NYX nude
beige liner my Kat Von D lipstick in
hexagram but you can basically just use
any dark matte bread and then my a dip
brow in taupe and I know that's crazy
but you just gotta rolled it cuz I don't
have a red a red tone a gray toned and
red so I'm just applying my lip liner
all over my Nets of C would be Kylie
inspired if I didn't know the jokes a
little bit obviously not like crazy as
she does but then I just know pregnant
lipstick over the top of that so that's
gonna kind of stop the great old days
you may not see it that much it did make
a bit of difference then once I've done
the lipstick I'm just dipping my finger
expert in and then applying that over
the lips as well and that's it
and then just paired it with a messy
loose bun and that was heads pipe basic
I know but she went for quite simplistic
look I think but it's kind of seasoned
appropriate as well as I hope you
enjoyed it please like subscribe it
really helps me in my videos out there
for more people to see if they love the
unit
