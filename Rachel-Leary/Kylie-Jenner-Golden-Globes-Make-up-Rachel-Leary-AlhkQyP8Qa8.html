to start off this Kylie Jenner Golden
Globes inspired makeup I mix my Nivea
post shave balm and my L'Oreal Lumi
magique
primer to create the perfect base and
add a bit of glow to my skin then i'm
using the l'oreal true match foundation
in the shade golden beige as you can see
my face is a lot paler than my neck so I
am having to cut a match which is why
the foundation does look a lot darker
but it matches the rest of my body which
is or what is most important
then I am taking a beauty blender with a
little bit of extra foundation on and
just pressing over parts of my skin that
I felt needed a little bit more coverage
and then it's just using another part to
be together that didn't have any product
on and just up stabbing that all around
my face to absorb any excess product
then I'm taking this Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow definer in soft brown which
is one of her new brow products and I'm
actually in love with it it creates a
lot of us a lot more softer look which
is the kind of look Heidi had going on
moving on to the eye makeup I'm taking
this eye primer from peaches makeup and
just blending that all over my lid then
mixing these two shadows from makeup
geek creme brulee and frappe to create
the initial transition shade on a Sigma
fluffy brush and I am taking this from
inner corner to outer corner as she had
more she's taken it like I said from
inner corner to outer corner and making
sure to definitely take it all the way
to the edge because we are going to be
cleaning up with concealer afterwards
then it's taking cocoa bear also from
makeup geek and applying this in the
same place but a bit further down to
create that initial gradient and
transition and then going back in with a
fluffy brush to make sure all the edges
are then it's taking this pigment from
makeup geek in nightlife this isn't
sponsored by makeup geek by the way I
just love their stuff and some of the
colors I thought were really appropriate
I'm just pressing this all over the lid
to create the lid shade then taking a
brown sugar I am using this to further
deepen and blend the pigment into the
crease colors as well
mixing corrupt and mesmerised eyeshadows
together on a angled brush I'm using
this as the liners for pressing it as
close to I can close as I can to the
lash line
I didn't look like Cody had any line on
it did look like she was using a shadow
or a pencil to create what she had then
I'm using a mascara this is Mac in
extreme dimension because her lashes
were super voluminous and then taking
the concealer the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade vanilla and I'm
applying quite a lot because I'm gonna
be using the product also in my on will
actually underneath my eyebrows and then
using it to clean it up like so on a
small concealer brush because it didn't
look as if she had a rounded eye it was
definitely a wing so I'm using the
concealer to clean up the edge and
create that look
really wispy lashes are always signature
to Kylie's look so I am taking these at
demi wispies from ardell but i did stick
individuals on the outer corner just to
add to the pad I winged look then I'm
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and not baking as such
but I'm just lightly dusting this over
the concealer to set it in place then
taking the brown sugar I shadow that
we've used earlier on a pencil brush and
running this on my lower lash line
connecting it to the wing that we'd
created using a balanced eyeliner from
Sigma as well I am running this in my
waterline this is the finished eye look
so something super wispy and easy and
smoky moving back onto the skin she
didn't really look as if she'd had
really heavy contour anything like that
so I'm using a cream bronzer from
peaches just just lightly a bronze my
skin then at taking unlawful blush up
from NARS and just pressing that onto my
cheekbones to add a pink flush this one
has a slight sparkle to it as well which
is super nice when the light catches it
too
to highlight my cheekbones Cupid's bow
and the bridge of my nose I am taking
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone on a multi sand brush I'm then
taking adult Jake a lip pencil from the
Kylie lip kit Mac's
morning coffee Pro Longwear pencil is
really similar if you guys are wanting
to try edge it but this is the one she
used in the night so I thought I might
as well use it
then taking creme de nude lipstick from
Mac and blending that all together on my
lips and that is the finished makeup
look then I'm taking a super cool
product from Illamasqua it's a
multi-purpose gel that you can use in
your hair or on your face to create a
really like I said corrupt look I'll go
into a bit more on my Instagram but that
is the finished look I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial give it a
thumbs up if you did and until next time
I will see you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
