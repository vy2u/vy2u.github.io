hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I asked you guys on Twitter what
you wanted to see and I kind of had this
picture saved on my iPhone for a while
loads of you guys said that you really
wanted to see the most recent kind of
Kylie Jenner red lip makeup look that
she posted on her Instagram not too long
ago I'll insert a picture here or you
would have seen it in the obviously
thumbnail or in the intro yeah it's a
super kind of minimal eye makeup look I
know she is never really too eccentric
with her eyelids but she just looked so
sophisticated and so glam and I really
liked the hair as well this is only
really a makeup tutorial the hair I do
explain how I do at the end but
obviously super simple just curled and
in the middle parting yeah so if you
like the look of this makeup then please
keep watching
okay so let's get our hair out of the
way
double horns as always yes I am in a row
because Sophie and who needs clothes
also I have my famil in the background
so I really hope it's not annoying and
you can't hear it but it is so hot and
if I open my window I feel like that's
louder so bear with so going to go ahead
and do a skin first and I am gonna go in
and moisturize my skin with my Mac
strobe cream all products that I use are
listed down below and make it easy for
you to find so I just like to apply that
on with other skyla I like to apply that
straight to my skin and then as you guys
know I always blend it in with a brush I
think I saw that all originated from I
think Lauren Curtis used to do that so I
always do it so this is just going wash
dry our skin
I love the smell of strobe cream as well
smells so good
okay onto priming our skin I am going to
use benefit bulrush Porefessional primer
just going to apply that more on like my
nose and my t-zone because that's where
I find have them at the most like open
pores and where I lose foundation if I
ever do like the quickest so just kind
of around that and then I'm going to
press that in with my fingers this time
well this smells nice too
then I'm going to use my all-time
favorite foundation this is Georgia
Imani luminous silk in the shade 6.5 I
think the Kardashians and the Jenners
actually use this one a lot as well so
yeah staying true to that and also
because it's my favorite too I'm going
to apply that to my skin and I'm just
going to press that in using a butter
egg sponge even though not normally with
winged eye makeup I do that first this
how one is she always was how I should I
relatively basic and I it's using like a
lot of matte shade so I'm not gonna be
using any like pigments and things so
there shouldn't be any fallout so I'm
going to go ahead and do my skin first
shocker
as you can see that I'm just matching
the color of my neck because my face is
rather pale our foundation is on two
eyebrows and I'm going to go ahead and
do it off camera real quick I have an
updated browser routine coming very soon
Thank You Rory I always link my old one
down below anyways but yeah so remember
so this eyebrows done we're going to
move on to the eye makeup just in case
as since we've done skin first we might
need to like tighten up the liner with
concealer and stuff like that but before
that I am going to take what I Amba used
for concealer which is the song which is
the sleek medium contour kit and I'm
going to take this color here and really
scoped out my brow with it
I've seen in her like tutorials and
stuff she's one she is one to sculpt out
her eyebrows so I'm just going to take a
small like synthetic brush like this
concentrating it like mainly under the
arch I'm just really using that to
sharpen up the brow and give us a
highlight
okay razzle bleep just blend it down
then I'm going to go ahead and pry my
eye and I'm just going to use my Mac
Studio Fix and see if it's my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in NC 35 just because
I plan to put this on my skin a bit
later anyways so this one's actually has
priming qualities to it as it's pro
longwear so I'm just going to use that
as my primer as well
Donna cancel out the highlight though so
don't take up too high like that and
then I'm just going to set that with
powder and then I'm going to go ahead
and do one eye of camera just because
I've no idea what I'm doing it so we're
gonna have a little play and then lots
of happy with it I will show you how I
do it and do the other way for you okay
so like I said once we look primed and I
in place I'm gonna take these deliver
warmer spectrum palette and I'm gonna go
in with this color here she had a really
intense brow bone highlight so this is
what we're going to use for that first
most of the eyeshadows that we are going
to be using are from this palette and
then but there's just one makeup geek
one so just kind of pressing that quite
intensely underneath the brow bone cuz
like i said house is really intense
concentrating it under the arch and then
just kind of like dusting out and then
dragging it down
then just taking a creme brulee from
makeup geek as this is a slightly warmer
color that the palette doesn't have I
prefer something slightly warmer in the
crease anyways so I'm just taking this
on a fluffy brush thing this is my Sigma
e-40 edges blending that in we're not
going to be messy like we normally would
just because obviously we're not wiping
away with a wipe gonna be doing with the
concealer so kind of be a bit more
precise with application with this just
buffing that into the crease not taking
it too far out but speaking of
eyeshadows what your guys thoughts on
the Kush a dope palette I liked out
first and then the more I looked at it
the more thought one that looks familiar
and like - I'm pretty sure I could make
that palette out stuff but I already own
like it's nothing crazy but then again
Kylie doesn't really isn't really really
experimental with her makeup anyway so I
wouldn't expect any kind of like
different colors from her there was a
lot of controversy I saw about it being
really similar to the Shannon Sony
palette or like the morphe 35o and stuff
and people are just waiting to hear on
the price point to be like you don't
need that Kylie palette you're only
buying it for the name not the actual
product yeah with that color you don't
want it to be too intense so we're just
going to stop there going back into this
waver palette I'm taking this medium
brown shade here on a smaller heavy
brush and just buffing that into the
crease
I do feel bad for her sometimes in the
sense that everything she brings out
everyone accuses her of copying someone
or they're being duped but it's hard to
come up with something completely like
not on the market just because they
don't tend to sell as well like most
people prefer warm colors most people
prefer nude liquid lipsticks you know
mean like it's quite hard then I am
going to mix these few colors together
what she had on her lid was pretty
neutral so I'm going in with this kind
of color and then this slightly darker
color just pressing that on then going
back in with the fluffy brush we used to
pry that medium brown and just using
that to soften any edges and blend it
all together then taking it this dark
brown hair on a even smaller fluffy
crease brush I'm just going to use that
to define our socket even further this
is going to be the last color that we
use because her eyes are very smoky but
it was all brown shades and very minimal
so I'm just going to use that kind of
concentrating mainly on the outer
portion of the eye just taking it across
to cut it up slightly I'm just blending
that up with into the lighter brown her
inner corner highlight was actually
really gold and shimmery so I'm going to
use what I'm going to use on my cheeks
as a highlight and this is the Jane
Iredale
24 karat gold dust in gold and this is
phenomenal on the cheeks as you'll see
but just as nice as an inner corner
highlight as well I'm going to take that
little shader brush that we used for the
lid color and just press that and you
can take up a tiny bit of slaw so it all
blends together that constant doing that
on the inner part like that now it's
time for eyeliner I'm going to use a pen
to do this just because her flick was
really kind of like fifty sixties like
Brigitte is it Brigitte Bardot like body
inspired so I'm going to use a pen liner
to do this and this is the waver
cat eye pen and this is the kind of
shape but I'm going to be a going for it
is really really hard to film this part
but I will film towards
the end just because I read like look
down and the amount of times I've tried
to film it and it's not worked out
because I've like gone off camera is a
joke but I always think a winged liner
tutorial down below so I've just gone
ahead and done the lid liner as you can
see I've not taken all the way into the
inner corner and kept it really thin
until about here and now I'm going to go
ahead and do the wing but she kept it
quite small like I said I'm gonna take
out about there yet now I'm just going
to go ahead and apply mascara and then
I'll show you the luscious underneath so
this is kind of what it looks like with
just mascara and I think to be honest
the general Kardashian's they don't
really wear lashes anymore but that's
because they get lash extension so they
put naturally it long a fluffy lashes so
they're the kind of star but I am going
to use but first I'm going to go in with
the makeup full spectrum a pencil in
expresso and just go in to my upper
waterline of all together it's on the
bottom but for now just under the top
you can just leave it there if you just
like mascara with this look but I'm
going to go ahead and apply lashes and
these are the filler lashes in the style
it show up fluffy just because they're
super wispy and natural so I'm going to
go ahead and apply them now and show you
they look like with them on this is the
eyes with the lashes on I'm now going to
go back and finish off the face and then
we'll be back to finish off the eyes
that make sense so if we can see like
I'm using two different products I'm
going to be going in with my Mac NC
thirty-five Pro Longwear again just to
kind of conceal not to brighten but just
to conceal any darkness underneath the
eyes and also this is the one I'm going
to use to sharpen up the winged liner
just cuz I personally don't like that
look of a really like white cut liner
and then just going to blend that into
my skin using my sponge again
I actually really love this look it's
like really minimal birth glam at the
same time then to actually add some
brightness and then also to contour with
as well again taking the sleek medium
contour kit and the lightest color on
the same brush and then just
concentrating that on the places I want
to highlight because she had quite a
bright under-eye
in the picture didn't really look like
she was wearing a lot of bronzer it was
almost more kind of contour so I'm just
gonna go ahead and take the coolest
color of this of this contour kit and
just apply that to the hollows of my
cheeks and just just to define them
slightly and I'm just going to use the
same joy fiber brush just to blend that
in
and then for setting underneath my eyes
hers like I said we're really bright so
I'm going to use a slightly different
look today I'm going to go ahead and use
the hourglass ambient lighting palette
and take the diffused light color I do
have that in a singular but I won't use
this just because of the blusher shade
in it as well this patter unfortunately
is discontinued but down below I've
linked both the kind of like separate
products I am going to take a bit of RCM
a loose setting powder just to set the
rest of my face as like I said it was
quite matte and this is just going to
make sure everything is locked in place
as well for the tiniest bit of bronzer
I'm gonna take Mac Minaj skin finish in
dark golden just because I've said this
before it's like the perfect Bronson you
just want something really subtle and in
the look she definitely wasn't wearing a
huge amount of bronze but I can't
imagine she wasn't wearing none so I'm
just gonna dust that lightly this is
also going to be good to set the contour
in as well then taking this blush up
from the same palette I think it's
called
luminous flush I need to I've linked it
down below anyway I'm just going to go
ahead and apply that to my cheeks being
not super heavy handy but enough that
it's going to show are quite obviously
because yet that is definitely one thing
that you notice in the photo
once you happy with your blusher go
ahead and apply a highlight I'm going to
go ahead and use the 24 karat gold dust
from Jane Iredale and I've been obsessed
with this at the moment
with the skin complete we can now move
it back on it to the under eyes and
finish off the look so to finish off my
eye I'm going to take that media matte
brown color from the zoeva palette that
we used on the eyes already and just
really buff that and smoke that out on
my lower lash line she take it
she took it quite far down and really
winged out as well like that and then
going back in with that pencil from
makeup geek just really lightly running
that in the inner corner in another in
our waterline then you want to go ahead
and apply your bottom lash mascara and
then that is the eyelet complete so this
is what the finished eyes look like I
really love this it's super minimal and
like really I found quite easy to do as
well so now let's move on to the lips
the lips I'm going to take the follow
your heart lip pencil from Mac and it
just line them or over line them or
whatever
but then for the lid I'm going to take
the nude sticks intense matte lip and
cheap crayon in the colored stiletto
so this is the finished makeup look I'm
now going to go ahead and curl my hair
and kind of finish off the inspired look
I do ever get ready with me coming up
where I cut my hair and I've curled my
hair and loads of videos before using
like a big barrel and in an outward
motion so then go ahead and do that and
then I will show you the completed look
so this is the finished hair and makeup
look together I literally just curl my
hair and then passed it in like the way
that she had and gave it a bit more
volume at the top so it's kind of really
like 60s and spite so I really like this
makeup look if you guys like this makeup
look make sure to give it a thumbs up
for more inspired looks and subscribe if
you haven't already but thank you so
much for watching and until next time
I'll see you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
