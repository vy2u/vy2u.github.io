today I am doing a highly requested
video ever since I posted on Instagram
that I received the original Kylie
Jenner lip kits you guys wanted to get
dupes and stuff like that because there
every time they're back in stock they
are so hard to get hold of I'm not even
sure how I got hold of them whether or
not they were sent to me or whether or
not orders that I thought I put through
did actually go through and though I
didn't but so I only have the candy que
Dolce K and true Branca I don't have the
three newest that she came out with but
I do have dupes for them just by going
off the swatches that I've seen on
Instagram hopefully these are more like
affordable ones like options as well and
a lot more accessible for you guys so
you guys can get the colors yeah so
let's get started so the one that i
found the most dupes for was candy k so
candy k is the lightest one of the
original three it's definitely more like
a pink toned nude this is definitely my
favorite liquid lipstick of them all the
Dolce K one on me is just slightly too
dark but the amazing thing about these
is that they smell phenomenal they smell
like vanilla and candy k is definitely
more of a color for it's going to be
more like a darkish pinkish nude on
colors like me you're a bit more tan
that we more of that everyday nude and
obviously if you're dark it will be more
like a paler pink so the dupes that i
found for that are the oprah liquid
lipstick in pasadena so I do have a code
with Ofra and it's Rachael Larry and
that entitles you to 30% off so you can
get it for even more affordable more
affordable price also the NYX soft matte
lip cream in abu-dhabi
and MAC lipstick in velvet teddy which
I'm pretty sure because of her anyway
and I think one of her makeup artist
said age ago that she wore velvet teddy
and it's like one of the most pop
matte lipsticks MAC lipsticks up there
is so I'm going to show you now them all
side-by-side so this one here or the
seat is the original I think the closest
one is probably Mac velvet teddy which
I'm kind of glad about because I think
Mac is kind of the most accessible brand
for most people and their lipsticks are
only 15 pounds 50 so it's not too bad
even though velvet teddy is one of those
shades that is kind of out of stock in
most places at the moment so this one is
velvet teddy this one is the NYX soft
matte lip cream so probably the most
affordable one I have them all and again
probably more accessible because you can
get NYX from a lot of places now like
you from the UK you can get it from
Selfridges or there's a NYX UK website
obviously there's an exam Eric website
there's Amazon loads of different places
and then this one is the Oprah one and
the lights kind of make them seem a bit
more or fish but on my hand they do all
look extremely similar this one
obviously is in the shade Pasadena none
of them quite have the same pigmentation
and formula as the Kylie lip kits which
is a shame but if you really like the
color then these are the three that I
own that I found to be the most similar
moving on to a Dolce K this one's
probably been the most popular I thought
just on social media and seeing people
wearing it I not so much a fan of the
liquid lipstick because it's just a bit
too dark on me but the pencil of this
one is my absolute favorite eye and
lover the Dolce K pencil unlike
sparingly using it because I don't want
it to run out because I don't know what
I'll be able to hold of it again but
this one was actually surprisingly up
quite a unique shade I struggled to find
one in my collection that was the same
and I only managed to find one
alternative for this one so as you can
see it's more of that dark brown nude
color so on people that are a lot more
tanned than me or even on a darker skin
this would look absolutely beautiful is
that kind of like everyday nude color I
think that's why it's so popular just
because it's kind of that perfect kind
of for over lining your lips as well so
the dupe that I found for this one is
the MAC lipstick in a whirl again
probably one of their most popular ones
including the pencil because the
Hansol was so popular again I think by
Kylie Jenner it was made popular but as
you can see they are pretty close in
color if you can't get hold of the
lipstick obviously the lipstick was
based off of the color of the pencil so
if you've got the pencil just drawing it
that all over your lip you'll get the
same sort of color again the
consistencies not so it's not the same
the Kylie lip kits go on obviously a lot
smoother and creamier cuz they're liquid
lipstick but and the world liquid
lipstick from the world lipstick from
Mac is a matte finish so hopefully they
both last a longer time and I think the
formula of the matte lipsticks at Mac
are a bit more comfortable because the
Kylie Jenner lip kit the original
formula I think people said it was a bit
dry but apparently her new ones are
amazing they both have a really nice
smell to them if that makes difference
but that is the one that I found to be
the closest if you can't get hold of
Dolce K lipstick
well lipstick from Mac is a good
alternative moving on to true Brown K
this one's actually quite a unique brown
shade I thought this would be quite easy
to find a dupe folks I thought most
Browns are similar like I have some of
the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipsticks and I tried the brown one next
to that but this one is really a true
Brown some of the other ones I found a
bit more red so as you can see on me
this is a real like I said true brown um
the only I only found it two
alternatives to this one and one of them
is a pencil
sometimes pencils all over the lips can
feel a bit dry but if you put like a lip
primer on underneath that should help
but because it's a matte finish they
should last just as long so the two
dupes that I found the true Brown K are
the Oprah liquid lipstick in Brooklyn
and the NYX lip liner pencil in Rose
Brown
so let me swatch them next to true okay
so you can see so this is the ofra
liquid lipstick in Brooklyn and this is
the pencil in Rose Brown I think the Mac
Pro Longwear lip pencil in bittersweet
and it's a really nice true brown color
which I think would be a good soup as
well if you wanted that Brown lip but
yeah so this one's actually quite hard
because the brown shade is so unique and
a lot of people are scared to wear Brown
I think it looks absolutely stunning
especially
more tan skins like I said um this one
would look absolutely stunning see we
can't get hold of true brown Kate even
though when I was on her website that
was actually the one that was left in
stock definitely tried these as an
alternative and like I said with the
Oprah lipsticks you can use the code
Rachel area on their website to get 30%
off so the other three shades that she
came out with for Valentine's Day was a
red a more lightish nude and a pink so
the red was Mary Jo or Mary Jane Mary Jo
kay the nude was coke okay and the pink
was Posie K I don't own those three as
of yet but going off of switches and
what I found I found three of the sleek
matte liquid lipsticks to be what I'm
going for pictures to be a really good
joob so starting with Mary Jo okay it's
quite like a blood red I'll try and
insert like a screenshot of it here and
then I'll put a swatch with this on my
hand next to it so you can see so as you
can see it's just like a true red liquid
lipstick a lot of companies do this but
I found that this one to kind of be the
closest match to that specific shade of
red and plus it is from the drugstore
and super affordable so um so you can
still kind of get that mary jo k vibes
but a lot more affordable price and the
sleek liquid lipsticks are actually some
of my favorite drugstore ones they go on
so nicely and they last the longest time
so this one I wore in a tutorial as well
so that is Roja red from sleek as a dupe
for Mary Jo okay moving on to a Posie K
that was definitely more of her pink
nude kind of rosy pink kind of color and
one that I found is birthday suit from
sleek as well so this one is kind of
more of a nudie a paint that I think the
one that she's got I think the closest
and thing a might actually be saw pencil
from Mac if you've got that one all over
the lip that I think from looking at it
on Kylie and has snapchat that's kind of
the color I instantly thought of if you
wanted a liquid lipstick this one looks
good as well so I'll try and insert
a clip or I can in a picture of Posie K
there and then show you this worm so
this one's kind of a bit more on the new
dia pink I think has is a bit more like
Rosie but Saul might be a bit closer but
in terms of liquid lipsticks this was
the one that I found to be the kind of
closest this one also might be I was the
tooth I put here I was kind of tossing
up between Coco K and Posey cages
because I've seen so many kind of
different shades of the color on
people's instagrams like swatch wise so
it was hard to find one exactly the same
but this one is pretty close so this one
is birthday suit liquid lipstick from
sleek as a Posie K jube finally onto the
last one koko K from a few of the
swatches I've seen it definitely looks
more like a pale pink kind of color so
the one that I found is the petal liquid
lipstick from sleek so this one again
like I said it's more that pale pink
color I'm not sure if the Koko Kate is
more like a pale pink or a neutral color
again I've seen so many different
pictures on different skin tones and
different lights of what it looks like
so I'm not entirely shortened until I
own them I don't think I'll ever be sure
but let me do a swatch for you so I'll
try and insert a pic of the Koko K
swatch somewhere but yeah so this one is
petal liquid lipstick from sleek makeup
that actually called the map me ultra
smooth matte lip cream do you want to be
specific while you're searching for them
if you don't only anyway there are
really nice affordable liquid lipstick
and they have so many other different
colors but these the ones that I thought
would be a good kylie jenner lip kit
dupe so yep this one is petal as a dupe
or coke okay so they were my Kylie
Jenner lip kit dupes I hope you guys
enjoyed let me know in the comments
