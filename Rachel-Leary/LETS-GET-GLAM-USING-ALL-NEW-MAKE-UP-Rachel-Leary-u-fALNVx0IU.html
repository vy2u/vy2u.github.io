you are new here then just welcome in
general make sure to hit that subscribe
button and the notification bell is on
and let me know when you have done that
in the comment section down below
because then you stand in it for a
chance of having a notification shoutout
which is happening at the end of every
video but in this video I'm basically
trying and testing a bunch of new makeup
that I got recently some new that is
completely a brand new to me that I've
never even heard of that I'm gonna try
and something that I'd heard of in the
past or maybe tried in the past I bought
recently and I feel like you guys are
gonna love it
so this is the look I came up with just
kind of like a mouths halo eye type of
vibe really gorgeous at Glamour's again
I can't wait to show you the skin
products on my god some of these are
like really funky so I really hope you
guys enjoyed that if you like the look
of this look already make sure to hit
that thumbs up button and then if you
want to know how I did this look and
what products that I use then please
keep watching
okay so we're gonna start with our eyes
first and I've already gone ahead and
done my brows and primed my eyes because
I didn't actually have any new brow
products which is annoying but if you
want to know how I do my brows I do have
an updated browser tune and it is in the
description down below my eyes today
we're gonna use one palette and it's
from models oh and it is that barely
there two palette I think so essentially
it's just a gorgeous gorgeous neutral
eyeshadow palette they do already have a
belly there one palette obviously but
this is their second edition is out on
the 2nd of February so hopefully this
will get you guys excited to try it we
are gonna do a halo eye today and then
first of all I'm gonna take this color
here in my crease so because we're doing
a halo eye you want to take the brush
from inner to outer corner and take it
on to the lid kind of like quite heavily
that makes sense because we're gonna
carve it out with concealer which will
then help to it tidy up so the fact that
you're messy actually kind of makes it
look a lot better because the color will
show up a lot clearer but so far this is
really nice I always find with this
these palettes so use the models own
palettes before that the shimmers are
always so so pigmented but these matte
shades are really pretty too but I'm
just gonna get progressively a darker
with the time so I'm gonna go ahead and
use this color here to further deepen up
the crease I just kind of like to press
it onto the lid afterward I like the
initial transition color I kind of like
to then continuously press the next
colors I like the outer corner the inner
corner and then take the color across
and kind of like connect it all up this
one isn't too too too different from the
first crease color that we used so the
blend is going to be a really nice once
you've done that again just keep going
repeating the same action but kind of
applying it out but further out and
further out either side I'm gonna take
this matte brown hair again like a
really nice warm rosy Brown and just
press that on the outer corner in the
corner and then take it across I will
say these are really easy to like blend
into each other all the matte shades are
quite close together in
hello like all their undertones are the
same so so that makes it like super easy
to blend and then just gonna go back in
with my fluffy brush just make sure it's
all blended out but now we are gonna
kind of tidy up the center space of our
lid and I'm just gonna use the concealer
that I plan to use on my face to do that
but I'll leave that as a surprise for
now I have used it before but it like
literally my most recent video so that
probably give it away but yeah I'm just
gonna take a small little flat brush
like this and just gonna concentrate
this in the center of the eye to create
the clear space or our halo eye it's
always good if you're looking down to
just like look up and check to see like
where your crease is and that kind of
stuff but I always like to do it
slightly a bigger then I'm gonna plan to
keep it because I do like to go in
either side with eye shadow to help
blend it out in that tense like cover up
like quite a lot of the concealer so I'm
gonna do that now so I'm gonna take this
kind of like the kind of second color
that we used to create that transition
I'm just gonna use like a pencil brush
to do so as you can see Annie's like
back and forth motions to create that
soft blend and transition see now I'm
just left with like a little cat for me
to put a little shimmery shade on so for
the shimmery shade I'm gonna take the
light gold shade from the eye shadow
palette I'm really excited to use these
the shimmery shades from the model's own
palettes are always so pretty and I feel
like yeah so nice it looks really like a
yellowy gold in the palette but once it
goes onto the eye it's a really gorgeous
like champagne shade and looks really
striking and ready here I'm obsessed I'm
just gonna back over that pencil brush
again once you're happy with the way
that it's blended I'm gonna go ahead and
deepen up the crease one more time with
the darkest brown shade I've really lost
colors like this because there's such a
like warm up tone Brown I'm just gonna
place that on the hour
most part of the eye and on me like I
know my spot and I like to use like a
flat brush to do this so I can be super
precise then just go back in with the
fluffy brush that we used for one of the
softer brown shades and just make sure
it's all diffused and blended I mean so
just went ahead and highlighted my inner
corner and a brow bone with that same
shimmery a goal but now I'm just gonna
take a wipe and just leave it like about
half a centimetre and just right away
cuz I do want to go for a slightly more
winged Allah and I like to leave a
little bit of the shadow underneath so
when I do connect it with my shadow
underneath my eye it's not so like sharp
if that makes sense so now I'm gonna go
ahead and apply mascara and today it's
like a new product that like I used to
love completely forgot about it and
recently bought again and I've fallen
back in love with there is the Mac
extended play mascara now I first heard
about this mascara because one I did
used to work at Matt and to Jaclyn hill
used to rave about this mascara it is so
good if you have little lashes like me
it's one of their defining and
lengthening mascara so the brush looks
like this it is super thin so perfect
for just separating your lashes and
giving perfect coat to just separate
them and help lengthen them amazing on
your bottom lashes this is like if
anything the best autumn lash mascara
and it's such a unique brush I've never
seen like mascara brush like see but
they're just super separated super
defined and lengthened and I barely have
any eyelashes and it just for me it
gives the perfect coat before I apply
falsies I'll show you again on this eye
I just I love that mascara I can't wait
I'm like almost excited to apply it to
my bottom lashes but we are just gonna
apply it lashes today unfortunately
again I don't even like newest styles to
try but this is a brand-new pair of
Lillie opulence lashes these are some of
my favorite lashes to wear every day and
they're super light thin a birth luxury
they look greedy
really like lash extensions so perfect
for a look like this way you've got like
a lot going on on the top of your eye so
the lashes aren't going out hide or
cover them they're just gonna add and
enhance the look so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply those and then we can move
back onto the skin but I really really
loves that eye shadow palette the
shimmers are so so pretty and I never
normally reach for mo that tone eye
shadows but I think these are really
really nice so that palette is out on
the 2nd of February so add that to your
Diaries if you are like a rosy and move
tone lover so these are the kind of
finished top of the eyes as you can see
the lash is just kind of add to it
because they're not super super thick
you can still see all the drama that's
going on on the lid space but now we can
move onto the skin which I'm so excited
Forks I've got a bunch of newer products
that I know you guys gonna love okay so
for primer I'm really excited to try
this this is it from a brand could touch
in soul that is a Korean brand and I got
it from a cult beauty and it's basically
a primer that's called feel like
honeymoon skin base primer you know I
told you how to tell if the primer is
really good is because it leaves a
little bit of attack well the fact that
this one was described as honey and
honey's really quite sticky I thought oh
my god I bet this is gonna be really
really great for the skin plus a Korean
skincare is some of the best out there
so I definitely wanted to try and it
comes like this you can see it's like
super runny and like sticky alike honey
so I'm so excited to see how this works
on the skin I'm just gonna go ahead and
oh like oh apply this all over the skin
it has elements of I thought it was
glitter shimmer in it but she maybe it
doesn't think it has like flecks of
something in it but essentially I think
it's just meant to oh okay it's not
sticky as I thought it actually feels
really nice and doesn't unfortunately
doesn't smell like honey but feels
really great on the skin like super
smooth air it does leave like a little
bit of a tap which is what you want in a
primer but it's nothing too too sticky
that's gonna be really really scary okay
so far I really like that what an
interesting concept I've named that
honey anyway the next foundation that we
are going to be using is again like an
old favorite that I've reached recently
repurchase so it's new for me and it
might be a new view
is the a Mac Studio sculpt foundation I
remember like I said before when I used
to welcome back everyone would always
come in they would always always always
just want to buy it Studio Fix
foundation because that was known to be
like the best one cuz it's full coverage
it's matte finish all of that kind of
stuff and no one really ever tried any
of the other ones studio scope used to
be one of the like favorites whenever we
did people's makeup on counter for
events and stuff because not only is it
full coverage it's like a gel base so it
gives a really really gorgeous finish to
the skin if you love a full coverage but
not necessarily the matte finish this is
a great one to try just rather done on
my hair burned on to keep my hair out of
my face but now we have done it
foundation honestly I love the coverage
and finish of that foundation if you've
never tried that matte foundation or
you've tried a Mac foundation and it was
just your fix and you're kind of looking
for a new one definitely check that one
out down below now if you consider I'm
gonna take the makeup revolution
concealer but this is a new shade I used
this in the shade c7 which was kind of
back to my skin tone c2 which is a
little bit too bright I finally picked
up c5 again this is still like a new
concealer for me I think this is such
like this will have made the brand I'm
not even joking it's only four pounds
and the coverage is just insane and I
love the applicator everyone keeps
saying it's like a dupe for the Tarte
shape tape concealer and they're not
wrong honestly the coverage is really
really comparable I think I said this in
my makeup revolution at a video that I
literally just did it actually feels a
lot more comfortable than the Tarte
shade tape just because the Tarte shrink
tape is super full coverage but like it
feels full coverage like it feels thick
but then you kind of get what you're
asking for if that makes sense and it
does look insane or is this one it feels
a lot more kind of comfortable on the
skin and still gives a very comparable
coverage so if you don't like the
feeling of your makeup feeling too heavy
we are in the market for like a full
coverage concealer definitely tried this
one and I actually might buy some kind
of like I'm contour colored ones because
I feel like they would look so good on
the skin so this is like a full coverage
skin look I don't have any powder so I'm
gonna go ahead and set my face in powder
and then we can move on to exciting a
cheap stuff so I've just gone ahead
and it powers the skin so I'm gonna go
ahead and finish up the eyes I'm not
gonna like the mimic on the top this
time just cuz we've gone for like a
winged outlook I don't know I don't want
there to be like too too much going on
so I'm just gonna take that rosy brown
shade there on a pencil brush and just
run that underneath my eye and connect
it back up into the wing what I really
want to show you is that like extended
play mascara on the bottom lashes oh my
god it's like the best ever I'm not even
joking yes now we can go ahead and apply
mascara on the bottom lashes see like
the size of the brush and like the
little bristles are just amazing at
separating and giving length to them I
just like I forgot how much I love that
mascara for bottom lashes I think it's
the brush it just makes it so much
easier okay let's add some color back
into my face so today I thought we would
just use like a shimmery bronzer so I'm
gonna go ahead and use the Maybelline
master crime which is now available in
the UK you guys know I was obsessed with
that molten gold highlighter well this
is the molten bronze version it looks
like a really gorgeous olivey bronze
which is why I was kind of drawn to her
and it has them it's not as shimmery as
the molten gold highlighter it's
definitely more of a shimmery bronzer
I'm loving how subtle one the glow is
and two of the color like I said it's
definitely more of a curve all of you
glow and what I love about the formula
of these is that they blend like a
butter and feel like butter as well okay
oh my god the next bright time it's so
excited for this is the Natasha de Nonna
diamond and a blush palette oh my god so
it's basically just a palette that's got
blushes and highlighters in it which i
think is so cool she came up with two
one was the slightly lighter version and
one was a slightly deeper golden version
I guess more aimed at speed with sunny
darker skin tones but iPhone II could
probably use either for either but I'm
gonna go ahead and take this a blush
shade I'm gonna be using a highlighter
from this palette too but we have
another product to apply first oh my god
what I love about her stuff is that it's
so subtle and she is all
about skin like all about skin below
just looking at phenomenal so the top
half of the palette is actually like
creams but I am sticking to the powder
site that is such a gorgeous Gloria or a
Maya grade you know you just get really
excited in like alright okay so before
we try out that like a diamond
highlighter I'm gonna go ahead and use
these these are from cover effects this
is a little sample of their Mirage
glitter drops so if you guys know it
they're custom enhancer drops they let
the liquid highlighter this is like the
glitter version and I know it sounds
scary to put glitter on your face but
these honestly a blend amazingly and I
find actually work better with your
finger I got my hands on these the other
day so I'm just gonna go ahead and do a
couple of dots and then just work in
with my hand just do a couple of dots
and then tap and blend into the skin so
you can see it just kind of adds a blow
but it's just a little bit more I know I
get blended oh yeah I guess it does look
a little bit more catchy but I actually
really like that
I like the look of having like a
glittery face I love that okay so now we
can go back in with the diamond and a
blush palette and I'm gonna take the
glow extreme powder
wow that is intense insane on the skin
but that is the finished skin and I so
now we can move on to a lips I have been
a loving loving loving these at the
moment they are new in from a buxom they
are the appellant line lip liners and
this is in the shade incognito which is
a gorgeous gorgeous slightly darker nude
than I normally a go for and I'm gonna
go ahead a bill in my whole lips with
this therefore easy to fill in your lips
with there's such a creamy blendable
pencil I love about them is that they're
a pencil then that in finish and they're
like designed to help plump your lips
too I just thought this in cook this is
the shade incognito and I just thought
it's a perfect color to go with this
look and I did think I did say the other
day I've been really loving matte lips
but I'm really kind of being drawn to a
gloss so I am I gonna go ahead and apply
the buxom
on that lip polish in the color katie is
the most gorgeous iridescent pearly pink
and I just kind of thought it would tie
in with what's going on on top of the
eye and just kind of really finish off
the look yes oh my god I am obsessed of
this look but that is the finished look
so this is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
