hope you're all having a really a
relaxing and chilled
Sunday's other videos of this week has
been really not to the Tuesday's a
normal schedule but that some people
could had that extracting video on
Wednesday and I'm going to give it a
little space in between each one so I
thought I would do a Sunday video I
thought I would do a question and answer
head I don't remember the last time I do
one of these and it's bit more relaxed I
mean you can just share and watch two on
a Sunday I asked you guys to ask me with
the hashtag operate on it Twitter
earlier to just send in your like weird
personal just questions that you really
want to know I got loads and loads of
makeup related questions so I'm
definitely going to film a kind of
makeup related YouTube like Q&amp;amp;A I'll
definitely do that at some points but
today I'm going to be answering your
kind of all we're they're more personal
one I don't dwell a lot on each one
because I feel like that's when you only
ever answer like five questions because
your answers been so long I'm going to
kind of like fire through them give you
those honest answers I can sort see
these are things that you want to know
so look up your name of the screen make
sure to hit that subscribe button and
give it a thumbs up if you enjoy it we
are really close to 500,000 and I would
love to see you here again so definitely
make sure to hit the subscribe button to
make sure the notifications on so you
don't miss anything else alright let's
get on with the questions or if I keep
looking over there because I've got my
laptop here with other screen shots on
so I need like readout where user names
and whatnot Isabella asks what's one
thing you've always wanted to do but
never have I've never been - I've never
been like traveling to somewhere like
Bali or something like that and I've
always always always wanted to go there
like the Maldives or just celebrity
black saying but you always wanted to
just kind of go I like on my own and
just like I feel that I would really
appreciate that kind of tropical holiday
or anyone just stuck in a bliss so I've
always wanted to go on Rosie on my own
to like the Maldives or something and
swim it with the pigs on the road by
side that's in the Bahamas you know like
be some of the pigs I really want to do
that what's my favorite candle scent
anything that smells like actually when
when I went to LA to Emily it she we
went to Bath and Body Works and she knew
exactly what she wanted not like what is
that and it's a candle called mahogany
teak wood or something but she got the
extra very good one basically just
smells like that really sexy boy smell
so I really like that smell but I do
like anything that's like three
like raspberry strawberry mango like
tropical fave scented things just
anything quite sweet but nothing like
fake sickly sweet like sweet like candy
floss and stuff that's not my smell at
all
hi-c says ever had a bad breakup I feel
like you have to have had a serious and
longtime relationship for it to be like
a bad breakup
I've never hammer them so I've had
things that are like not good um I've
had things with people I guess or just
kind of like relationships but there was
no like label to it where it's been like
really really intense and then ended
really horribly so I guess so but it's
nothing like Facebook official like we
then weren't to go on Facebook because
we would never we weren't together on
Facebook ever in the first place I know
Facebook McCarthy just but you know
I mean yeah and no I don't know how to
answer it not an official breakup but
relationships is separated happy also
are have you ever met a youtube internal
life that are different in person as to
on camera yes for good and bad reasons
self-explanatory gift some people you're
pleasantly surprised and some people not
presently this going to but just like
confused Vic says honey ever suffered
from anxiety or depression and not that
I've been to the doctors for and been at
diagnosed like not that long ago that I
went to a bit of a favor I really like a
habit like social anxiety or something
that you can't face anything she want to
be on my own and can't really talk
without everything just being so I would
like literally something's really
overwhelming to me I actually can't
function can't talk I just going to like
a shutdown and I don't know what is it's
not depression and I don't think it's
anxiety sometimes my friends think that
I feel like you might have a bit like
social anxiety sometimes because if
things get too much like I said I just
can't do it going to shut down to talk
to you whatever like so I've experienced
why think could be it but no I'm quite
obviously lucky to say I've never
suffered from it and she also asked what
advice would you give people with little
/ no confidence after a breakup that is
what's always actually scare me about
long-term relationships it's just how I
like it if it came too
and how would I even cope because I've
seen my friends break up with long-term
relationships may just go into absolute
meltdown I'd like to think I'm quite a
strong person I can be very like
cold-hearted like cut something else
okay fine done whatever just that kind
of thing but I know obviously when
you're in a long-term relationship I
guess you build up that attachment and
whatever so when they're not there
anymore I must be RC awful I think the
best thing I can say is during the
relationship just make sure that you've
kept your friends I know a lot of people
get to their friends and relationships
because it's like you're just so wrapped
up in it all and I feel like your
friends in your family you don't realize
how much of the support system they
actually ask your life don't the
relationship that you're in be your
backbone like you need other things to
do distractions I feel that's how
successful relationships work if you're
just with each other 24/7 or you have at
each other that putting it said to each
other that's when you want to like you
might get tempted to be with someone
else because you've had enough you know
I mean so like if you do break up after
a relationship I just feel like make
sure that you're surrounded by positive
uplifting people make sure if you've got
rules that you want like you don't want
to text them whatever tell that to your
friends and say like do not let me do it
don't let them give in they need to like
to help you obviously it's not there I
mean it's not their responsibility but I
just I would say well I'd like I don't
know because I've not really been in one
make sure you just got a really good
support system around you or everything
positive if you're planning just never
to get back with them then I would
actually cut them out completely don't
let them don't let you don't be in a
position where you can see what they're
doing constantly because then you're
constantly thinking about it if it's not
there you don't think about it in my
eyes so I would just block them from
everything to try and move on throw
myself with positive people and get
dressed the up get grand do
whatever it is that makes you feel
amazing and just like me just do it like
go out and get drunk and make sure that
you look 100% when you look good I don't
like to feel good so just put a lot more
effort into you take time for yourself
of Pam
sessions on a spa retreat with your
girlfriend or like boyfriend just
whatever I can I think rambled and
that's why I didn't want to do I hope
you took some points from that but next
question okay like a name to Sophie says
what's the top three qualities that you
look for in a partner we have to have
like the same banter if we can't if
you're not as weird as me and I feel
like you're judging me or something
which never going to get on so same kind
of Fanta obviously I have to be like
attracted to them and I've got just
three I feel like I was going to be
funny but I think I'm quite funny so
that probably gone to the same
personality type thing loyalty I guess
all hard-working either way you're lazy
so unattractive personally to me as a
quality so yeah of seal oil and then
hard-working boys that come from two
personalities well you know I mean those
oh my god but yeah the Brady says would
you rather go back in time and meet all
your ancestors or go into the future to
meet your grandchildren probably go back
in time to meet my ancestors because I
feel like history quite interesting I
feel like it would Pirlo and perspective
for me and now as I'm not a lot I might
take for granted right now so it'd
really be quite good for my ego and all
that kind of stuff just as like a
reality check and also yeah I just think
it'd be a lot more interesting I mean
it'd be interesting to see the future
and but then I know that that's coming
and I'm going to just be thinking about
it a lot so I think I'd rather go to the
past I think not knowing the future is
kind of the whole amazing point of it
and why it's so surprising really it
says updates on your day to nine I'd
give you an update if I had one never
been one for relationships all right
long like I'm very quite like a alone
person we love to be drunk my friends
though but ya know nothing really just
talking to a few peeps in the how will
you Linda what's the longest
relationship you've been in love you
love me too longest relationship couple
months I've never it but then I know I
wouldn't come off as a relationship that
I've been like on off with someone for
probably about like two years but then
it's like there's some people in between
but you know you always have that one
person that there that one person's what
we've been like around for like a couple
years Rebecca says what's your most
embarrassing
seeing moment americium barking barking
select my friends need to be here to
tell me what's like my embarrassing
moment for me I used to be I used to say
like a lot of weird stuff to people I
think like because I thought I was
really cool and I once got grounded
because I cycled to go and get some
alcohol off my friend when I was like 12
and then I got cool pretty embarrassing
like I cycled to get alcohol because
that desperate um there's been times
we'll see wells like fallen over and
stuff I can't even maintain trust in it
okay I thought something embarrassing
but I know there's a question coming up
a bow on it so I'm going to wait till
then Ilana says would you rather have to
head precise the golf ball or the size
of the loaf of bread love you love you
too I'm probably at least as bad if my
head not look besides a loaf of bread
right now you can get like head shaped
loads of bread I'm going this is bread
snog marry avoid this from Ellie not my
avoid Cameron Dallas Marcus Butler Joe
sugg and well probably Mary Mary Cameron
Dallas
Malcolm of the spotless boy do suck
avoid Joe sugg and me again later Kyra
said craziest thing you've done an eye
out and I feel like this is why I think
this is like the question I thought was
coming craziest thing I know it that's
not embarrassing though is it I'll maybe
I'll say goes so probably like
embarassingly crazy things I've done
night out is get myself so drunk that
I've actually fallen asleep and a
nightclub Tyler back with my head in the
toilet because him so unwell and not
woke and like my friends had to look me
in there and that was probably about
midnight and Cubs around where I live no
we shot like three or four thousand
sleep like three hours in the nightclub
and then got to about 3 a.m. had a bang
on the door with my friends being like
right time to go
like whoom yeah that's embarrassing me
crazy I guess another crazy saying I got
all the way to London for a night out
drunk so much on the train I actually
got the club was there for about 45
minutes was sick in a cup and then gone
over the whole way home which cost a
 fortune Katie it says what's one
of your biggest regrets so far probably
the way that I can treat people
sometimes because I can be quite cold
and not think about the consequences of
what I'm doing because if someone did
that to me I wouldn't care something and
doing that has resulted in like the loss
of the loss of like friendships or just
like ruined friendships or relationships
type things yeah I guess so like I'd
like a personal one or another regret I
met Ed Sheeran and our port once and my
sister wouldn't come up with me to get a
picture so I just didn't get it to be
she went home and I really regret
extinguished like I just went alone but
I didn't Chloe it says last photo on
your camera love you love you too okay
it's a screenshot of a new Drake film
called teenage fevered I'm pretty sure I
just sent someone to say listen to learn
now Katie says what's your favorite
thing about your personality I think
it's a real good question and again I'd
probably say I hate it I don't
I am quite calm I would say and I can
talk to people quite well during like an
argument or something I never never like
to raise my voice and less I'm one Grunk
and so angry and have like every right
to be angry but I would never really
like to raise my boys they hate it
because my I think I think it just stems
from like um like family like I used to
hate it in my dad like in my dad shouts
at me and I just didn't ever want to I
just face it
so I started still things about where
don't think that's the way to get
through to someone it just makes the
other person more anger ever so I like
the way that I deal I can deal with
situations okay that's what it is so in
terms of arguments I don't like to argue
in quite quick to resolve things have a
love
understanding I don't really care about
I'm very good at saying I could make a
picture of things I won't dwell and
little things yes we think they just
sound quite like a calm person and my
ability to let go sometimes can be a bad
thing but it is probably one of my
favorite things because I do pretend I
don't really tend to fall out with
people a lot and it's never people that
people don't enter for that with me
along but yeah okay I think Lana is your
name have you ever had a weird sexual
encounter like a partner with a fetish
no not as not as of yet of experience -
fetish and you know weird
what counts is weird because oh I think
that's totally normal but someone else
might like no like I can't imagine it's
like really odd that you'd be like what
the hell
so now I've not experienced hang on with
a fetish in like that I'd probably have
tweeted about it - behind also asked do
you date a lot is finding someone
important to you are great not important
to me I said yeah I mean maybe in a few
years I'll start to be like if I'm still
like single but no I don't really date a
lot literally it just doesn't it's not
the top of my list right now things I
need I've got such maybe even my life
when I'm talking to it it was fine
if someone comes along song I'm along
I'm not looking for like anything right
now serious anyway Oh another one live
says current relationships ages do you
want to change it single don't want to
change it probably not right now I
actually have so much going on I can't
you know the beginning of a really loop
the beginning of a relationship is like
that honeymoon stage may not be spending
all the time together doing anything I
don't have the time to give that to
someone right now and I feel like that's
so unfair so I wouldn't want to put
someone through like meeting like wait I
can't do it Conte discontent yes the
other things come first when I'm at
stage I already content everything
settled down on something you're on it
and like whether the money 20 even my
parents
when they were in school and they still
are together that so the pressures on
and she also asks 100 bucks a hundred
chocolate bars or never eat one again
never eat one again I'm not on my
chocolate eat it's nice to have a little
now and then but my skin is so sensitive
to chocolate I'm feeling like I could
have a few like caramel nibbles or like
something next day but like it's just
not worth it's me I mean sometimes
chocolate does hit the spot by Bravo I
can never have it again and have like
then there's something else sweet then
that Amy says oh hi Rachel love you in
your work thank you what your hangover
cure okay I always after a night I'll
have to moisturize my feet it doesn't
cure my hangover but it does make me
feel like the light is so bright right
now and it does make you feel so much
better
don't ask me why I always find think I'm
weird I'll be like letting moisturize
your feet oh my god I think I have a
weird thing about feet but like I always
like to moisturize my feet oh my god is
so bright I always like to moisturize my
feet I made a tweet once and so many of
you agreed with me I need different
drinks I don't know work tip ups light
search go
I need different drinks normally it'll
be like a smoothie a cup of tea and
something else probably like a glass of
milk or something I'm kidding like I
always need different liquids and that
always makes you feel better I go to the
bathroom normally I still got half my
makeup on my face oh my god wait hold on
and we're back um yes and normally led
to different drinks I'll go to the
bathroom probably get another makeup
wipe and take off the makeup that I
didn't take off the night before shower
like singing the shop sitting sitting in
the shower with the rain on your face
thinking about everything that you've
done or that you can't remember that you
did that makes it definitely feel better
but like just feeling it clean and then
a sheet mask that's what I do and then
just do nothing the rest of the day
maybe but netflix and better like
something just take time to just okay
Mia create any crazy night out stories
so the one about me falling falling yeah
falling asleep in the Twitter
being sick in the cupboard having to go
home after 45 minutes oh I had one girl
wasn't actually that long ago she fell
really like a few weeks ago we were
outside of like our local spoons or
weather and she was trying again spoons
but security was saying no like she's
way too drunk which she evidently was so
this is nothing like personality a kind
had a level of understanding because
I'll explain but then it actually
results in police coming up to me and
saying do you want to make it cut folk
do you want to report her and I was like
no like I get that she's drunk there's a
bit by roots yeah basically she was like
all over my friend and he and he really
ought wasn't interested like you know I
could see like she she'd got ourselves
into a beverage state like her outfit
was kind of like wedged up halfway off
and like ahem just everywhere like she
was being really like I think you know
that liked opening like that kind of
drunk and so my head was just a bit like
and like looking at me to be like can
you help me so I grabbed his arm and I
was on your arm and then our attention
came to me and she was talking to me and
I think I was wearing like a top that
was no it was like really low-cut though
see how you could see chest
I should just lunged at my chest and was
like yeah it's a fake and I was like
what are they no they're not and then
she like spun me round like full-on
spun me around grab my arm azalea they
are history cuz well I was like oh my
god I was like stop touching me for one
and two like no it's not like a wish
like it's not that good and then she's
like coming up my friend being like you
need a nose job and then she started
walking away and I think my friend just
I think she might been having like a
fire or something and just like flicked
at her because she was so annoyed but I
was kind of found next to have I had my
back turned and she thought it was me
but through her and she just yanked my
hair and little I was like literally
thought I was going to fall over and
then everyone's not getting involved it
was all over
and we should just happen like it
literally happened within his base like
five minutes and yeah
I'm a violent person didn't hit her not
