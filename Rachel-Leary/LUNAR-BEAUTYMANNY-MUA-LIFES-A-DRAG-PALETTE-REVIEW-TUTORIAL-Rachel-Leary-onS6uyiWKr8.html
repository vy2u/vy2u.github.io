back to my channel I know I look kind of
like bizarre right now but today we're
doing a another palette review you guys
have really enjoyed my hooded beauty of
Hallett review that I did not long ago
and I have been blessed with the Luna
Beauty life was a drag palette by a
nanny MUA I'm sure you guys know him on
Instagram and YouTube if you don't where
have you been living probably under a
rock I have been a huge fan of his for
such a long time I've had the pleasure
of meeting him a good a few at times as
well so when he reached out and said
that he wanted to send me his first
makeup product I I was shook I was shook
I was I was shook and I knew I
wanted to do a review and show you guys
because I like fingers crossed it's
coming into beautybay in the UK but I
know so many of you guys will watch him
too and it's such a gorgeous palette and
so colorful I knew I wanted to do a look
with it as well so before we get started
on the review it is personal edification
a bell a shout out timing you don't know
what that is
when you guys would let me know in the
comment section down below that you
subscribe to my channel and hit the
notification bell or you've just come
upon your personification bells then I'd
go through the comments I'd read them
all and I give one of you guys a shout
so if you want to get involved make sure
to do that now subscribe hit the bell
and just give the video a thumbs up
while you're down there already it
really really helps me out and it just
shows your support but today is a little
bit of a special shower actually comes
from Twitter it comes from Abbey myths
the non-official pretty who says it's my
birthday tomorrow as in today my post
and vacations are on and I would love a
birthday shower in your Manny videos so
please love you here you go happy a
birthday Abbey happy 20th birthday Abbey
I think I hope you have an amazing day
this one is for you but without further
ado let's get on with the review and
tutorial using life's a drag
as you guys know I'm a sucker for
packaging anyway and this one does not
disappoint it has like a rainbow kind of
holographic you know Sheen to it and
when the light hits it and you can see a
manís eyes on the front it says lunar
beauty on the back and like rose gold
the pinky riding oh my god and then you
open it up and it is just gorgeous I
love the fact that it has a mirror it
feels really like well made as well as I
could really fit we're not really fit
you know a sick and it's steady palette
and it comes with a brush which I have
kind of like played with a little bit
already there's like a fluffy brush side
and a flat top side just the classic to
be able to do whatever you want within
this palette we kind of have the more
everyday map kind of crease colors on
the left hand side to kind of everyday
shimmery shades for the lid in the
middle and then the more colorful
experimental site at the end so there
really is something for everybody in
this palette I think that's kind of why
it's grabbing everyone's attention a
beauty guru has done color everyone
shook but I really love palettes that
represent the artist that creates them
you can tell he really put his kind of
stamp on it with the color side but also
the neutral ground side because we all
know that he does a variety of looks
using you know those kind of ends of the
spectrum so I feel it is so much time
I'm just gonna do a finger swatches
today because your girl just faked an I
don't want to wipe it off my arm but
think I'll do close-ups of the finger
swatches after I do them so let's kind
of do this end of the spectrum here
let's do the more neutral shades because
I know for me whites and blacks are very
important when it comes to a palette if
the white and the black aren't super
pigmented it's just a bit like they're
kind of like staple colors to be able to
transform other colors if you know what
I mean so let's start with this end so
I'll also just do a little bit of a
close-up so you can see the shade names
as well so let's start off with kind of
this side like I just said so I'm going
to take the
shade which is cake face the neutral the
light neutral Brown which is sickening
the kind of more cool tone neutral Brown
which is hunty I love that one
hunty then I'm gonna take the black just
Shady
oh sorry you'll see in a second then on
my thumb I'm gonna take the kind of dark
warm Brown called trade can you will
wanna look at that black oh my
god that's pigment if I ever saw it and
then this was the hunty shade sickening
cat face and trade all so pigmented for
matte shades and just to kind of show
you there's like no fallout in the
palette after I swatch them but it might
be different when I use a brush but just
from a finger swatch off the bat looking
good
so I'm now gonna do these kind of like
four shades in the middle so we've got
the other map neutral shade which is mug
the two shimmery shades the pink one is
beets the gold is legendary and this
gorgeous pink is called Chi Chi KK it's
about K AI k AI okay so let's do mug
beats legendary and Chi Chi so you can
see there they definitely don't
disappoint either so mug beats legendary
and Chi Chi I'm obsessed with that pink
oh my god I definitely want to do
something with this and maybe this in
today's look and again even with the
shimmery shades off of the finger
swatched there's no fallout but finally
let's swatch the gorgeous a colorful
spectrum and the yellow is campy the
purple is pageant queen the turquoise is
Kiki the blue is fishy and the burgundy
is snatched Celeste you can be pageant
queen Kiki fishy and snatched so you can
see they all again swatch incredibly and
all the brightly colored chains on that
there's only actually two it shimmers in
this palette which is kind of rare for I
feel like a beauty guru palette he
definitely wanted to stick with more of
the
Matt shades and really worked on the
pigment and you can tell is really paid
off it is insane but as we know it just
because something a swatch as well it
doesn't always mean that they perform
well or blend well so I'm gonna go ahead
and do one I off camera so we can go
ahead and get started I've no idea what
kind of look I want to do but yes I am
so excited to play I have no idea what
I'm going to come up with it's something
with color let's go so I'm just gonna go
ahead and prime my eye with concealer as
you can tell I did a little play around
on the other eye just so I knew because
I knew I wanted to incorporate some
other products and really kind of make
this extra as ugh so yeah just need to
know what I needed in terms of like
glitter so as you know I like to leave
my base kind of wet if you will I don't
really like to a set it with powder so
much these days just because I like the
way I shadows cling and then can blend
them out on that kind of surface so I'm
gonna start off a by taking the yellow
shade which is campy and just take me on
a big fluffy brush this is my blank
canvas cosmetics 821 brush and let's
work this in to our crease as you can
see pigment gained strong still them and
they are really easy to blend out as
well sometimes when you apply a shadow
on to like a wet surface that's just
like that's it that's what you're going
to get from it they don't really work
and blend out but I love how bright
these show up I'm gonna take the yellow
quite high because I want the color to
kind of transition all the way through
and like still be visible even though
I'm gonna be putting on as many of the
brighter colors as I can I'm now gonna
be taking the shade Kikki which was the
turquoise color from the eyeshadow
palette on my 20 brush again blank
canvas cosmetics and you guys know the
drill working this in to the crease I
kind of wanted to use complementary
colors so I wanted the crease to be
mainly the yellow and
to kind of blend and make that green and
then have that pop of paint on the lid
you know that's the kind of vibe I
thought I'd go for I'm not seeing anyone
do that yet so hopefully this will be a
different look for this palette and then
just going back in with the yellow just
kind of like reinforcing the color my
name I'm gonna be taking the blue which
is the shade fishy and this is a blank
canvas a 26 brush just your classic kind
of like fluffy brush and just gonna
concentrating that mainly and to the
crease this blue is so pigmented like
this is a blue if there ever was a blue
gonna buff that in so it's kind of got
that crease shape going on then we're
gonna go back in with the yellow and use
that shade to blend or it doesn't matter
so much of its not completely blended as
you get on to the lid because we are
going to be doing a cut crease look
which only seemed appropriate with this
being a kind of like a drag inspired
palette they basically invented the cut
crease so yeah just gonna have that kind
of little turquoise moment going on it
there I'm now gonna go ahead and just
apply concealer to my lid and cut that
crease good thing to do is just kind of
apply to the middle look up and then you
kind of get a little idea of where to
kind of stop and how far to take it up
like so and now I'm gonna take a flat
brush and the pink shade called ke ke
Kai Kai so I'm like that and just pack
it on oh well I find it with mats the
pigment is sometimes so hard to get
these are in st. especially bright
colors they're so difficult to sometimes
achieve their like vividness that they
are on the palette on your eye but this
is beautiful
there isn't a tiny bit of Fallout but
like you can see like barely any and let
look at the palette from the colors that
I've used there's literally none next
none the tiniest like speckle of dust
just kind of applying this Oh see where
we cut out the crease and then I'm just
gonna take a little tiny shader brush
this is a e27 again blank canvas
cosmetics I'm gonna reimburse that fishy
shade which was the blue it's kind of
back in to the crease and pick up a tiny
bit of that yellow shade on a fluffy
brush to help blend that out slightly
and really enforce that green like so
and then again on that little shader
brush I'm gonna take the pageant queen
shade which is the purple and just kind
of use that to create a bit more of a
cut crease as well then just use the
brush that we had the blue on before so
and now I'm just gonna take a wipe and
just clean up underneath and create that
winged shape like so I am gonna take a
little pencil brush and take the beach
shade which is the shimmery pink and I'm
gonna use that as my inner corner
highlight because I want there to be a
bit of shimmer going on but I'm also
gonna create a little bit of a glittery
cut crease so for the Cubs crease I'm
going to be taking a few kind of pink
eyeliners I'm gonna be taking the NYX
vivid bright vivid petal eyeliner and
this is just kind of gonna act as a
solid color base one put the glitter on
cuz sometimes I find the pink glitter
doesn't always translate as pink glitter
it just goes on on its own so this is
going to be a nice base then I can
assign I'm going to apply some glitter
on the top I'm going to be mixing Lee to
Ivan decay I heavy-metal glitter liners
in catcall and grind so I'm going to
apply Cat Cora it's a slightly deeper
pink shade or like reflex of glitter and
then go in with the lighter shade on top
just for a little extra Sun Sun so now
I'm going to go ahead and do a liquid
and lashes I'm gonna do this off camera
just because it's quite hard for me to
like multitask so the lash I'm gonna be
using are the Lily lashes in goddess and
the black the liquid eyeliners I'm gonna
be using is the urban decay a razor
sharp water resistant long wear liner
and perversion which is like the
blackest of black so I'm gonna go for
like kind of a thick a thick wing and
I'll be back to show you the finished
eyes so these are the finished eyes I
love the way that they've come out I
love the complementary colors so that
this was a good way to kind of
demonstrate how to use or show you how
the bright colors of the palette work
and blend but I'm now going to go ahead
and do my skin off camera I do plan to
do a Instagram video on the skin that I
will do in this video but this is
obviously just a palette and eyeshadow
focused video so let me go ahead and do
that and then I'll be back to finish up
underneath the eyes to complete the look
and then we are done so I've gone ahead
and done my face I am feeling we watch
more myself right now
but to finish off the eyes I'm gonna
take this blue eyeliner this is from
Urban Decay is that 24/7 glide-on eye
pencil in the shade vivid and I'm gonna
put this in my waterline that is very
very hard to a film on a camera but you
can see I have done it and I'm now gonna
take the pageant queen shade which is
the purple shade on it the brush that
came up with the palette just to a buff
that out and it's smoked out our lower
lash line I love the kind of like candy
vibes I just want to make sure
everything is kind of tied in together
like so so I just went ahead and applied
a bottom lash mascara but this is their
finished makeup look if you want to know
its skin and lip details there will be a
few up on Instagram when this video went
live and I will be doing a more in depth
skin routine on my Instagram soon so
make sure you are following me on my
