really important and then down here is
where I keep drugstore palettes so we've
got some next all in here these are all
next they are sleek here again from
bigger next ones at the back and then
ones from Maybelline so now we have
tackled that side of the room it is time
to tackle this side of the room so they
are like one two three four kind of
acrylic drawers both of them are from
Muji and I've just stacked them on top
of each other the lipgloss holder on the
top there is from a by al gory and then
again these are from the same a
collection that the other drawers are
from and these are just two expanding
single ones and they are also from vary
so let's start up here this is just kind
of like a weird thing I think I got some
like TK Maxx but I just kind of put all
my tools in so like eyelash curlers
scissors nail files that kind of stuff
and then this is kind of where I'm
displaying a lot of my lip products as
you can see mainly because I have a lot
of the same brand so I just like to lay
them all out for kind of go to them up
by brand so the top here we kind of have
all Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipstick and again underneath these are
also all unfavorably held liquid
lipsticks in my color order then
underneath we have morphia liquid
lipsticks so they all belong in there
then as you come down if these are all
to a phase liquid lipsticks and then
underneath that is all urban decay kind
of like lip products or liquid lipsticks
as well then under here we're going to
get two glosses these are all of my
Anastasia Beverly Hills lip glosses
these are all granted now with me these
are Marc Jacobs and Matt and as mini Mac
ones at the back neck at the back here I
keep all of my buxom lip products these
are some of my thing and here we have as
you a and know
and at the bottom here we just have a
time of two faces lip gloss and so some
of their peach lip oils and then they're
like extreme lip injection glosses there
so again I display all of like my Kylie
lip products at the back there that
includes glosses and liquid lipsticks
and then I have these three or why no
sell lip products and the front is
because I love their packaging and any
only three twice on the products I've
got so I'm going to keep them out and
display in the top here we have a color
pop these are their color pop lippie
stix and then these are the color pop
glosses again this is all the color pops
but these are their liquid lipstick so
the matte ones and I think I've got some
satin ones in there as well and here
these are all tart liquid lipsticks I
just keep them on display and then we've
got some mini ones at the back again
they are still from talk and here I have
all of my lips and liquid lipstick and
in here I have all of my stealer and
liquid lipsticks and also my liquid
lipsticks from Oprah this is such an
annoying draw because it's just like
slightly it doesn't completely fit but
these are all of like my hood at beauty
lips toast and then three of the liquid
lipsticks I have at the end this is a
little bit of a mismatch straw but these
are kind of all of the liquid lipsticks
and gloves that I like of the same size
so I've got loads and loads of colors
it's Geoffrey start and then peaches
makeup brushes at the bar in here I keep
my makeup for ever colored like lip
paints and then my mini hooter liquid
lipstick the kept in there as well
because they literally fitted perfectly
at the end and these again are a little
bit miscellaneous but these are like all
of my nude lip glosses all of these ones
are from the drugstore so we have like
soap &amp;amp; Glory we've got L'Oreal at the
back these are also L'Oreal but then
we've got two random like Sephora ones
in there and again this is a
miscellaneous drawer of nudes but it's
like Elizabeth Arden Tom Ford Charlotte
Toby all of a slightly higher end and
like Kiko stuff like that but yet
they're all of like the nude spectrum
now are diving into these drawers in the
top drawer here is like my last drawer
if you can see over there I start a lot
of lashes like on my makeup desk I've
got loads of lashes in there so
realistically I think I'm going to need
a bigger home for these lashes but we
some pinky goats and hooded beauty all
of the white one Borowski though it be a
pink box is loo lashes all of the purple
ones are the old kind of the lure
packaging etc etc now in this drawer is
kind of lip products that I don't really
reach for but have a lot of so we've got
the makeup geek the lip glosses their
makeup geek liquid lipsticks these are
all aligned crime they're like the lips
stoppers that were like jewellery and
then liquid lipsticks these are some
more galactic products and then Jesus
Mike miscellaneous brands then I also
kind of keep like some lash accessories
in here so some extra large glue and a
little case for lashes in there in this
drawer is kind of where I keep a lot of
my drugstore products so we have some
NYX products in the back there like
butter glosses they're soft matte lip
creams I've got two lip palettes here
again like some more NYX products even
like their liquid lip lingeries in here
I have orders like my sleek products and
then here I have some Rimmel and then
they are Tanya burr now these two
drawers I still need to go through but
for now they'll have to do these where I
keep all of my lipsticks so we've got
some makeup planner in the front all of
those ones there are adding decay I have
a lot of matte lipsticks that's why I
keep all my limited edition matte
lipsticks all of these are filled with
buxom lip products and at the back there
again at their all as in decay and they
are all sleek I particularly want to
talk about this drawer I really really
go through it all of the ones in foxes
are from Smashbox
again it down here we've got some Tom's
poured in a mask these are all from
hourglass we've got some Kat Von D again
some slightly bigger
Mac little some MAC lipsticks like that
didn't fit in those little things that
were in there yeah this is a drive we
need to go through but it's so
overwhelming I kind of just like shut it
and pretend that like it's not there and
then in the bottom again is a little bit
of a mess what Samantha McCann nails
products from here but again all of
these are like the drugstore licks
lipstick so all of those ones over there
are soap &amp;amp; Glory and a lot of these are
L'Oreal but also
Maybelline and yes I believe like go
through all of these and see which one
they actually want and then I can
prepare them and get them away now these
kind of drawers are relatively boring
but approaches in anyways I feel that
you'll want to know but yet these
kind of where I keep a little mini
skimmed hair some brush cleaning out all
that kind of stuff here it's like my
place master all I do it go to this draw
a lot I love a good mask to all of my
sheet marks in here mainly a lot of them
are from emails ink but we do some soap
and glory again some more masks from now
sink and then this and lip balms and
stuff at the back this is like my hair
product straw so just kind of like heat
protectors and hair sprays and all that
kind of stuff and like little hair
accessories you can't really see but
like there's a lot of things I can put
my hair ties in on like hair brush and
stuff here's where I keep kind of a lot
of my excess of body moisturizer so
we've got some from obviously at
Palmer's I freaking it love at Palmer's
products and then soap &amp;amp; Glory the body
sharp all that kind of good stuff if
that's poison there and if these two
drawers super boring
it's literally just like brushes oh like
still in the combination act so it's
just kind of like excess brushes still
in like their packets or like Beauty
Blender so when I'm done with brushes I
can just go into there and grab some new
ones and finally I'll just go over what
on my desk so I keep all of my go-to
facial brushes there and usually benders
there a lot of stacks of lashes that I
reach for a lot of the time they've got
two mirrors here and just this thing

tweezers Beauty blenders and mirror like
