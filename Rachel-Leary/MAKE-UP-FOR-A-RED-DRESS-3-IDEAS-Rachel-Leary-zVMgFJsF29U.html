as you can tell by the title and the
intro today's video is one that I think
is just in time and perfect for the
party season I have created three makeup
looks that I think would well suit a red
dress red dresses around this time of
year because it's like Christmas and
stuff are increasingly popular and I
know sometimes it's kind of hard to
decide what makeup to wear whether or
not to go bold on your eyes on your lips
or whatever so these are kind of three
ideas that I would personally wear with
your red dress you obviously don't have
to do them and many suggestions and you
can take what you want from them this is
the first look that I created so if you
want to see how I got this is the first
part of this tutorial and then the rest
will follow just a heads up I only do my
base once in this tutorial and is in the
first one just because my base doesn't
change throughout it's just kind of my
lip and I options let's do so I thought
instead of continually repeating what
I'm using on my face I'll show you in
the first one so if you like the idea in
the concept and just the general looks
in this video then make sure to give it
a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't
already and definitely make sure that
you have my notifications on because you
know what YouTube's been doing at the
moment so just click the bell down by my
name I think it is or the subscribe
button make sure to follow me on all my
social medias as well you will see them
in the kind of the next slide
yeah I really guys enjoy this video and
let's get started
for this first look I'm doing my skin
and brows first I'm using my deep brows
from anastasia beverly hills and this
lore'l brow artist plumper I've left
everything in the description bar down
below in case you miss it but I am first
of all going to go ahead and moisturize
my skin using the Mac strobe cream my
skin is actually looking really good at
the moment I was having a really good
skin day and I loved the appearance of
strobe cream on my skin when it's like
this and this is the peach colored one
as well then I'm going to go ahead and
prime my skin this is the benefit
Porefessional primer I like to
concentrate this mainly in the kind of
like center of my face and I like to use
it downwards emotions to do that and
obviously I like to use a brush as well
you guys know I love using your brush to
apply it my skin products for foundation
I'm going to go ahead and use the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD stick in the shade
127 this matched me really well at the
moment I'm not so freaked out at the
moment you guys would be pleased to know
and I've been I've spent a bit of time
with Hannah over the past week and she
gets so so so many compliments when she
wears this and I haven't worn it in ages
so she inspired me to wear it again and
I have to say I forgot how much I love
this foundation it has such a gorgeous
finish to it for concealer I'm taking
the Maybelline fit me concealer in the
shade 15 sorrowed and insert a clip I
have left it down below and there are
other clips where I use it in the future
where kind of due to the order that I
film this I forgot to include it now but
yes I wanted to brighten up underneath
my eyes so I'm going to go ahead and use
one of the lighter shades of this
concealer to do that and then I am it
just bluffing that in with a Beauty
Blender and yeah make sure it's damp
though otherwise it doesn't do the job
this concealer is really like the NARS
radiant creamy one so it is quite thick
and that's why you like to use a Beauty
Blender to absorb any of the excess then
I'm going back into my old friend Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder and
just using that to set my whole face to
warm up my skin I am at taking this at
peaches bronzer in the shade
light/medium and just dusting that
around the perimeters of my face and on
my chin and all that good stuff just to
warm up my face because I'm going to
contour using the Bahama Mama bronzer
from the balm just in a much smaller
brush and this is just going to help
define my cheekbones and all the places
that I want to appear kind of you know
narrower and for blusher I'm taking this
mineral blush up from neve cosmetics in
the color summertime neve cosmetics i
feel it's just so so underrated they
have the best pigments and blushes ever
so definitely go ahead and check them
out if you haven't already and for
highlighter i dug out this old gem this
is the makeup geek and kathleenlights
palette and just kind of dip my brush in
all of them and just use it to highlight
all the places that i want to bring
forward so my cheekbones at my nose and
my Cupid's bow on to the eyes I'm taking
the blank canvas cosmetics master series
palette and this color right here for
this eye look this is definitely for
someone that doesn't really maybe oh my
god can't get my words out that isn't
very adventurous maybe because we're
only taking a few eyeshadows and it's
very minimal on the eyes so I'm just
buffing that into the crease and then
just taking this color here to further
deepen and that's literally the only to
crease colors that we're going to be
using you can obviously turn this into
something else and make it a lot more
dramatic by deepening it up with darker
colors as well but for this look I
wanted to keep it minimal for those of
you that may not like be very
adventurous with your eye makeup and
again like I said neve cosmetics
produces the best pigment and this is
one of my favorite pigments of all time
this is liquid mirror by them and it is
a really gorgeous champagne gold would
definitely it double up as a incredibly
like intense highlighter as well so if
you do try that definitely be careful
and this is another favorite that i
don't think i've used in a tutorial yet
it is the Stila cosmetics metallic
shadow in a pixie dust and i find this
works the best when you use your finger
and just apply it directly to your lid
it just gives such a gorgeous glittery a
gold finish and then going back in with
one of the fluffy brushes that we used
earlier in the crease not with any
additional product just to kind of blend
the two together and then taking that
second crease color that we used in the
crease so the dark one of the two just
using that to run along at my lower lash
line and connect everything together and
that's literally it for eyeshadow
besides highlighting our inner corner
and stuff and I'm just using the same
palette to do that and at the a matte
white shade then I went and applied
these lashes you guys love these on my
Instagram yesterday they're from
backstage beauty in the
style I think this is Melrose Avenue and
for lips these are some of my favorite
matte lipsticks this is from its sleek
and this is from Anastasia Beverly Hills
bless the names down below but for this
tutorial I am going to use the Mary lip
kit from Kylie I recently got this and
definitely wanted to try it out for you
guys
loved loved loved the way this applied
her lip kits I think just keep getting
better and better so yeah this is the
first look so again maybe someone maybe
a look for someone that's a little less
adventurous but I still feel it's a
super effortless and put together for
the second look I'm gonna go ahead and
at prime my eyes with the Maybelline fit
me primer
again just buffing that all over my lid
and then it just setting it in place
with powder to make it super easy for
when we blend shadows together for the
eyeshadows I'm taking the NYX warm
neutrals ultimate shadow palette and
this warm brown shades right here just
mix them together and at buffing it in
it to the crease for this look we do get
a bit of Fallout just as an FYI so you
could just not do your skin first but it
was quite easy to wipe away so I'm just
giving you a little heads up with this
and this one I'm trying to get more red
in the eye makeup rather than on the
lipstick so kind of switching it up and
that this palette is perfect for it
because it has so many warm shades and
I'm taking this red shade here and just
further deepening the crease and going
back in with that fluffy brush to blend
it all together for the lid shade I'm
taking this pigment from peaches makeup
they also do incredible pigments and
they're so affordable as well you can
see that I did get a little bit of
fallout here so maybe put a better
primer down or something that's a bit
more sticky and this one is in the shade
secret so it's like a brown tone red and
then mixing these two glitters together
it is the NYX red glitter and then the
Mac black and red reflex glitter I'm
just applying a glitter glue and now
maybe you should have done that before
but then yet just pressing the glitter
on top and mixing them together until I
get the desired color
then mixing it these two burgundy shades
together from the same next palette just
using that to kind of clean up the edges
make sure everything is blended together
you guys and know the procedure
and then going back in with my trusty 2
to 4 Mac brush just because I love the
bristles on this I feel like it just
blends everything together then going in
with this shade this is like I think
it's the darkest one of the palette and
just kind of concentrating this mainly
on the outer portion of the eye to add a
bit of kind of extra dimension and make
this a bit more intense and it's smoky
this time and then I just brushed away
at the fallout which was relatively easy
to do and then just highlighting the
inner corner and brow bone again then
taking my concealer and just applying
that underneath my eye and then I'm
using a small brush to kind of it drag
it out and kind of create a wing but we
aren't going to use any winged liner in
this one you can obviously add that if
you want to then I just applied mascara
and these lashes oh my god obsessed
these are in the style Rodeo Drive again
from a backstage beauty and then using
the slightly more redder shade from that
palette just using that underneath my
eye to kind of connect it all together
and it tie everything together
so these aren't the finished eyes and
then I went ahead and completed my skin
makeup exactly the same as I did before
but now I'm going to do a nude lip with
this one so I'm taking this entice lip
pencil from nude Stix this can actually
go all over your lips so feel free to do
that
I just kind of used it as a creamy lip
liner because for liquid lipstick I went
ahead and use the Geoffrey start
mannequin I'm obsessed with this one
it's definitely my favorite one that
he's ever produced and it's almost like
my perfect nude so this is the second
look I did again like I said wanted to
concentrate the red on the eyes rather
than the lips as kind of switching it up
and something a little bit different on
to the third and final look I'm doing my
eyes before my skin at this time so
going ahead and priming my eyes the same
way so using that Maybelline concealer
and just setting it with powder going
back in with that blank canvas cosmetics
palette I'm taking a slightly cooler
shades can't remember the shade of this
one exactly but it's one of the lighter
brown ones and just buffing that into
the crease then mixing it these two
colors together on a slightly more
defined crease brush I'm concentrating
this kind of above my lid and just try
to really get it into my crease because
I did kind of want to create a softer
cut crease look with this so using kind
of slightly smaller fluffier brushes to
do so like Sigma e25 Mac two and seven
that sort of size then to kind of
further deepen the crease I'm using a
even smaller fluffy brush and again like
I said just concentrating this and
mainly in at my crease not kind of
buffing it onto my lid or anything like
that just above my lid to create that
soft cut crease effect obviously going
back in with the suits afford a blended
are together but then going in with the
concealer you know how I like to kind of
cut that crease and it's been a bit of a
trend at the moment this just kind of
cleans up your lid and makes things so
much easier for you so I love doing this
and then I'm setting that in a place
with this matte white color this is kind
of an all matte eyeshadow look so for
those of you maybe that don't like using
shimmers this is perfect view or if
you're of a slightly mature age and have
kind of sagging skin mattes
are perfect for that maybe not as
intensive look as this but just as an
FYI for those maybe that do makeup on
other people then I'm cleaning it up
with a wipe after defining the crease
with that slightly darker brown shade
this is going to give us a good base for
when we do a liner speaking of which I'm
using the Natasha de Nona blackest black
star liner this is incredible it has the
smallest like sickness brush so you can
get a super precise line and it's
amazing for when you're doing that kind
of inner corner bit and you could just
leave it as the matte black but as you
saw it doesn't come with a glitter kind
of top coat so I was really excited to
try and use that and put that would be
something different but just going ahead
and showing you how much easier is when
you have a kind of base to work with to
do your liquid liner like I said you
could just leave it as that but I'm
going to apply it the glitter and you
just apply this on top it has the same
brush size as well so again you can be
super precise with your placement and it
just unknown added a little bit more of
a festive touch as that's obviously at
what glitter does these days and again
using another pair of backstage lashes
these ones are the synthetic ones in the
style Chelsey just because I thought
this way you can still see my eye makeup
and I wanted that glitter liner to show
through and then taking the soft brown
shade that we used on a pencil brush
along my lower lash line to tie it all
together sorry my eyes are really red
this was like the third time of taking
off my makeup so you have to bear with
me with the eyes complete it is now on
to the lip again I am taking another red
off so you could do whatever lip color
you want but I thought red would tie it
all together and this is from Too Faced
in the shade lady balls and that is the
third lip complete so a bit more of that
kind of classic glam all matte look with
a matching red lip
so that we'll see a third look I really
hope you guys enjoyed that look and all

much fun filming it with so much makeup
