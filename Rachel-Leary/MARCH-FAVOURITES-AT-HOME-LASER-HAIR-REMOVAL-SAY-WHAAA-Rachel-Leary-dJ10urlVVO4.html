today we are doing a March favorites
video I cannot believe we're already in
April that means next month is May it's
nearly summer oh my god I'm not ready
but there's been so many amazing
products that I have discovered in a
March not just makeup and all of them I
feel like a mean kind of summer related
get you in the spirit of things getting
ready for summer that kind of thing so I
hope this video is gonna be helpful and
you find some really new interesting
products when I say it not just makeup I
ditch me I'm going like all ends of the
spectrum I've got some DIY body glow
like a cooling down a primer and also an
at-home laser hair removal kit let's
jump straight into the view and let's
talk about this first okay so this is
what I'm talking about
so this is the IPL 200 laser hair
removal kit which is gonna be one of the
new products in littles new Beauty range
now let me tell you something about this
I have not probably shaved my legs and a
very long time thanks to this bad boy so
like I said little I'm launching a brand
new range of a beauty of products and
this is going to be available in a
stores only from April the 5th so in
like wait tomorrow when this video goes
live it's only while stocks last I know
this was super super hard to get hold of
because it sells out so quickly because
if you think about it for the price
point if you do your online research and
you look at the clinics that do laser
hair removal to do as many treatments as
it gets to work whatever it can be like
500 pounds but like six treatments it
can be 500 pounds this you're paying the
one-off pricing just do it whenever you
want so how it works it's like as you
can see it's just like a little machine
like this you're given a little booklet
that obviously has instructions with it
just to see whether or not you're
suitable to use there things you
shouldn't shouldn't do with it all that
kind of thing so you want to make sure
that you've got no tan on or whatever so
I can't really demonstrate it right now
because I've got tan on but essentially
what you want to do is just to shout off
anybody makeup whatever in the shower
and also you do actually want to shave
the areas that you want to treat because
this doesn't necessarily get rid of like
long hairs what it does is get rid of
the hair
inside your skin and just kind of help
to get rid of them completely so what
you want to do is take the booklet on
the back of the booklet it kind of gives
you a guideline of your skin tone and
then the hair color and then your kind
of obviously like match it up and it
tells you which energy level to use
because you're so you don't want to use
one too high and might really doubt but
and/or damage your skin but then you
don't want to use one too low and it not
really do anything and what I love about
this is even though you're at home
you're still getting the
state-of-the-art
IPL like technology that you would get
if you were getting it done
professionally or whatever like that so
you're still getting the same treatment
but in the comfort of your own home so
like I said it she just gets rid of the
hair root to reduce the chance of your
hair leg hairs or what are the hairs are
growing back and like I said I don't
remember the last time that I like
properly shave my legs because of this
right here
I mean after three or four treatments
it's like up to 50% hair reduction which
is amazing this in combination with
another product that I've got hair I
have had like the silky smooth legs ever
I always a little bit scared about laser
hair removal because of maybe what it
does to your skin and if it damages it
or not because I've always been a little
bit nervous about it but this has an
integrated UV filter in it specifically
designed to protect your skin so when I
saw that and just how easy it was gonna
be and I could do it at home on my own
so I wouldn't have liked anyone going in
between areas or whatever I love this
you can literally use it at home and you
can get it from little from tomorrow in
stores
honestly and get it while stocks last
because this will sell out so quickly
and you definitely are gonna want this
for summer we literally turn it on I've
got it plugged in so I guess I can turn
it on like so and then a little green
light will come up here and this
determines your level so it's
automatically on at level one but if the
chart told you you needed to be on level
two check it again that goes up you guys
know the drill when you're ready to go
you just press this up here and just
start zapping away it's so handy
especially like I said for the summer so
it's available from Lil's brand new PG
range which will be out tomorrow April
the fifth use it as many
did you run this is like straight in me
basket thank you and thank you so much
for little for partnering with me on
that segment of the video because I've
been wanting to show you guys that for a
long time I thought it'd be so handy for
you guys to have cuz I know laser hair
removal sounds like such a good idea but
spending all that money and going so I
could clinic or whatever never know
where to go I just thought an at-home
kit you guys would really appreciate it
especially before your holidays coming
up or you just hate the bane of shaving
your legs this reduces that all that
time and effort by so much so I hope you
guys appreciate that little gadget that
will be available for you tomorrow
from little stores only get it while you
can thank you but as I said you do shave
your legs before you use that and this
has been one of my favorite things ever
this is from pink it is that soap and
skin coconut oil dual phase body wash so
this is kind of like it has a body wash
in it but then like an oily moisturizing
liquid in it as well I've just shaken
this up right now but normally it's like
pink and there's a white layer this one
smells incredible but two leaves me
feeling so soft I'm not even joking I
just kind of doused this all over my
body to keep myself anyway but I kind of
really concentrate on my legs and kind
of rub my legs and kind of create that
lover but you can get with like bubbles
and stuff and then what I like to do is
shave my legs as normal but kind of
using this is almost as like my shaving
cream and then use that laser hair
removal kit and I swear I left baby butt
smooth for like the longest time
obviously with the laser hair you can
use it a few more times but I've not
needed to shave like since if that makes
sense and this has left my skin feeling
so soft and slinky and moisturized and
like I said it smells amazing this is
from the new Victoria's Secret pink
beauty range I love anything with
coconut oil because it's guaranteed to
really soften and smooth my skin and
yeah so I've left the link to this down
below so the next thing you guys would
have seen on my Instagram stories a lot
and again I think would be really good
at for summer or any sort of activity
but you know what you might be getting a
little bit hot you know it's a primer
and it's from a sport effects and it is
their cooldown primer and recovery gel
what this does is again
it's a primer so anything that you put
on the top is gonna last a long time but
what this actually does is really kind
of hydrates your face and helps to
reduce redness while you're working out
or just getting hot if that makes sense
so when I apply this I do actually feel
a slight tingling sensation and what
it's meant to be doing is helping you
kind of cooled down and reduce the
redness and work with you while you're
working out so again we're just for the
brightness cuz if you're like me and
you're at the gym and you want to wear
makeup to the gym but because you get so
red this really really helps maybe even
if you don't put makeup on over the top
this just really helps to reduce the
redness on your face help controller and
then yeah if I said it's a prime so it
helps make your makeup last even if
you're not working out but you maybe you
just want to get really hot or you're in
a job that gets you really hot
throughout the whole day and you find
that your foundation isn't really kind
of covering the redness that might come
through this is really really great to
work with your skin and I've been
wearing it to the gym and I love it so
the next two products I'm going to talk
about our foundations kind of total
opposite foundations and two that are
kind of new to me actually one's not so
much new to me then the other one but
it's new in the sense that it's been
brought back into my life but we're
talking about the new one first so the
one I'm wearing it right now and I wore
it in one of my most recent videos I
just found I've been reaching for it so
much it's the LA girl Pro matte HD
foundation I wear this in the shade
light tan but I literally just love it
the coverage is like medium to full but
it's so easy to apply I love the color
range of this light tan is definitely
one of my lighter tan colors but I think
it looks really really nice with my skin
a really nice yellow undertone I love
the fact that it's matte and HD I think
this is gonna be my new go-to foundation
to like film in because it works really
well with lights and because it's a
matte finish I don't look super super
shiny or anything like that
I've been trying it a lot more with a
lot less kind of oily products
underneath to really test the matte
finish on it and I really really do
believe that this is a beautiful matte
finish whenever I put this on I feel
like I don't really need a powder but
honestly I've been reaching for this so
much as a go to your foundation I know
really really great lasts a long time
and look great in pictures and
under-lighting as well so if you do a
lot of that stuff definitely check this
out it's available at beautybay and it's
only like a tenner it's ridiculous and
the other foundation I've been loving at
the moment is the Loreal Pro blow I've
had this for ages because it's been
available in the US for ages and they
made sure to pick it up when I was over
there on the seat this is gorgeous if
you love a slightly more satin and gooey
finish not that kind of thick cream
coverage this is like a medium coverage
that you can definitely build on but it
gives you such a gorgeous kind of JLo
glow it's only currently available
exclusively at Amazon so I've left the
link to it down below with all the shade
ranges it's just a really hydrating at
foundation I feel like this would look
gorgeous in the summer when you just
kind of want maybe something slightly
lighter but still to kind of last and
look really beautiful on your skin I've
the color 209 at caramel beige this is
slightly too dark for me right now but
this is definitely more of the color I
wear when I self-tanner honestly I just
love this they're infallible range is
really great at lasts a long time and
sometimes is a misconception with below
we looking at foundations and they're
not lasting all on your skin this one at
last is the longest time really has a
gorgeous satin finish and it's not too
heavy on the skin either so I feel
comfortable wearing this site in the
summer so the next product I'm going to
talk about is a highlighter again I use
this recently in a video it is the NARS
new powder highlighter in Fort de France
now I'm not gonna lie I can't remember I
actually said this in the previous video
I didn't like these at verse I literally
just from off the swatch like you don't
really pick up a huge amount of product
so I thought oh this is not going to be
good or just like not kind of like the
highlight that I like I like all the CF
blinding highlight I know all of you
guys do Tilt so at first I was thinking
like now I've got better ones whatever
but I was doing that testing new in
video this was kind of it the new
highlighters that I've got so I thought
obviously I'm going to try them and test
them for you guys that you know my
thoughts how wrong was I oh my god
you'll see it in the previous video of
how this look but this gives you such
unlike blinding highlight but it blends
so smoothly into your skin if there's a
drop it looks so natural I do like to
wear I had that the food of beauty a
cream highlighter from the bronze
palette underneath I do always like to
add like a cream or liquid highlighter
underneath my highlighters anyway just
to really make them stand out but this
in combination with a cream or a liquid
highlighter just looked beautiful but
honestly they did so many colors of this
as well this is just kind of the one
that I've reached for the most it's in
Fort de France you should really check
this out if you haven't they are so
luscious on the skin I'm obsessed they
blend like butter the next couple of
products I'm going to be talking about a
more on the Spray side of things one's a
second spray and one is a DIY home
bronzing spray that I know will be like
my summer essential but the first thing
I'm going to talk about is it the wire
cell hydrating a setting spray mist I
love a mist
so I hate those setting sprays that once
you spray them on your face they brew
need I feel like they've left literally
like drips on my face cuz it's quite
like a you know you've got like dots all
over your face and you really do have to
fan it out this is literally exactly
what it says I'm gonna spray it now it's
just like a mist I don't feel like any
residue it's like sat on my face I'm
waiting for it to dry it smells also
really nice as well and it really does
feel like it's just hydrating my skin
and getting rid of that powdery effects
that might be on my skin just kind of
really making my makeup blend into my
skin then it's not just sat there you
know it really works with your skin's
been really reaching for this lately and
the other thing I'm talking about you
would have seen when I went to that mac
fix+ event ages ago we created our own
kind of body glow mists but I was using
Mac pigments and stuff like that which
kind of give a bit more of a subtle glow
to the skin
I want glitter darling I want bronze I
want whatever so I actually mixed it
with a brand called peaches makeups
their pigment ends famous which is
actually more like a refined glitter
pollen let me get so it looks kind of
more like this I don't want to get this
everywhere like this kind of color I
literally put like a few big scoops
inside my coconut fix+
let me show you okay now I just kind of
look a little bit wet at the moment but
because that's not a pigment and it's
like actually refined glitter I'm left
like sparkly and bronzy and I look so
DUII I want to spray this that you all
over my body and the fact that is the
coconut scent as well just reminds me of
holiday and all that kind of stuff
so I feel like actually iconic London
just come out with their like branded
version of this so this is just kind of
more of the DIY version of that if
you've got fix+ and you've got pigments
I love this and you can customize it
however you want just pop your favorite
pigments in a fix+ give it a shake and
your glow into the woods so the final
two items are kind of more of the basic
makeup kind of fave just once I've been
reaching for so much not necessarily a
March launch or anything like that but
just throughout this last month I've
been reaching for it so much more than
the first one is an eyeshadow palette
the one from makeup revolution it is the
chocolate orange one it just contains
like the perfect shades of like matte
colors that I've been using my crease
some highlighting shimmer colors as well
not to mention it smells like oranges
it's honestly like me in a bowl it's
just like me in a palette I've just
found reaching for this so much
really quick eye looks done wash all the
colours I need her in there so
affordable as well love this and finally
I think I made a tweet about this maybe
at the beginning of the month or the end
of last month but just a lip gloss that
I can't stop using it's the Fenty lip
topper in gloss balm honestly it's
called the university lip topper and she
has got that bang on it goes on top of
every nude any color literally where on
its own on top of the mountains with a
satin worth of any shade of nude this
just makes your lips look so thick and
juicy I love that applicator of it I
love the smell if you've not
yet picked up a venti beauty product I
definitely recommend this being a
guaranteed one that you can't not love
it's not not going to be your color it's
not not gonna look good on you honestly
it just looks incredible
smells incredible and who else is so
excited for her new summer launches with
those body lovers like oh I'm already
feeling pretty shaped by that collection
but honestly this is like an OG of NT
beauty product it is always gonna be one
of the best things that she's ever come
out with looks amazing on everyone put
it straight in your basket and I don't
think you'll have any regrets I really
