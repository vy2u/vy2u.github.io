said I did not sat down and using like
spoken the camera box because the
schedule this week of videos has been a
little bit different it's because like I
said I am vlogging my week I have so
many exciting things going on this week
so I definitely made sure to plug it and
that will be up on Friday so I kind of
want to make sure everything with evenly
spaced out so I'm doing a Wednesday
upload today more casual background I
think sometimes you guys prefer this
background but this is going to be a
whole I want to BL click hold things up
and to show you a lot better so yeah
like I said this is a massive summer
clothing all from like plain old thing
misguided I know that's quite like an
easily accessible shot from most the
people that watch me for like the same
age so I thought if you guys like one
style and you're going on holiday and
you want to do the bit that I'm getting
then this will be a good video
annoyingly mother nature decided to
creep up on me one on the busiest
weekend too and I wanted to film a try
on hold so I don't think I'm going to
try them on but I'm sure like because
I'm going on one day I'll be posing
after pictures of all of this stuff so I
am really sorry about that
but our Father is do let's start with
mid sided so the first thing I got from
misguided is actually a bag it is this
it's like a little crossbody hit myself
with the strap but in the little
crossbody bag with a chain like this I
thought it was really pretty
I have don't really have a small a
smaller black bag just to kind of tie
around but all you need is like just
fine a little bit of makeup it's called
whatever when you're just like strong to
the shops or something you know that
when you're on holiday just need that
little bag not a huge beach bag I didn't
just have one that went with everything
all my kind of black bag kind of too big
for that so I want to make sure I got
this and it kind of reminds me of the
Gucci one you know that has the like
symbol a bit you'll see without spending
thousands and thousands of pounds on
that little side bag so that is the
first my boy so it was kinda dope
everything I really like that'll zip
detail and in the next thing I got is a
pair of shorts now I really like these
these are like so it's paper bag shorts
I think they're described so they've got
the really kind of like thrilled waist
and then they're just like a really nice
fabric with loose fabric sure I'm aren't
the only denim shorts that I actually
like her from new look surprisingly the
fit of them it isn't really comfortable
they're not too funny
and that's so cool funny unusual you
know I mean but I really have been
loving it being short something I think
they're super super flattering they're
on so comfortable in the hot weather so
I definitely think I might guess you are
more pairs but just cuz they were plain
black I thought they just go with
everything and I plan to actually wear
these tonight at the NYX face awards
going to that tonight but I plan to wear
these so I'm sure you'll see them on
when we're done and the next thing I got
is actually like a little skirt hope you
still have the label on because I've
been saving them for the whole I do mind
like wear them and then get them dirty
and then after washing them and then not
be ready in time the next thing I got is
actually this skirt it's a really nice
fabric like super comfortable fabric and
it has that kind of like war hence it
almost looks like you cut it yourself
but I just thought I love a white skirt
I think if you have a little bit of a
button or white makes your butt look
like more out then you know maybe want
to like grab it a bit more but I just
thought is it super super comfortable I
love wearing skirts in this weather
because just let it air out you know I
mean it's too hot to wear jeans too hot
to sometimes wear that's short to get a
little bit of tracing so this is just
perfect so this was just like a white
fabric hand shut and look board and
literally a white fabric skirt would
like that rule hand I just thought
literally go with everything whack on a
baggy like Fante and you don't thank you
the next thing like I don't got a lot
Basics around the summertime it's when I
realize that I haven't really got any
basic stuff and just need stuff that's
going to go with everything so the next
thing I got was there's a body suit
literally I've looked at cooler and
nineties net body suit core so it's
quite high net because if you like a
bigger chest gal like me some people
might just get bored of seeing your
beautiful the time so mix it up and have
a high net and this is bit and I thought
this would just go with like let's say
those shorts we've done insures like a
little belt just something honestly just
a plain white bodysuit to go with
everything in the fabric of this is
really kind of like stretchy but but
tight so if you like it might suck you
in a lot as well
so looking forward to trying this and
seeing if it works think it's quite high
as well that looks like that's going to
right up my ass
and that is why I'm not trying on right
now where are they
I've lost the earrings so the next thing
that I got were actually a pair of
earrings and they look like this they
are super kind of like a dainty little
golden Crossland
I just thought like I wear earrings
quite a lot normally it's a pair of oops
I just listened like quite a nice
alternative a little bit more like
classy and civilized it's still like
glam and when you've just kind of got
your hair up maybe because I am trying
to have my hair up as much as possible
and outside because I get like the worst
sweaty neck ever so just like a messy
updo and like a little statement pair of
earrings I still so much even though use
a simple festival statement and it's
super pretty
so if you've been into your jewelry
recently like me and interest in kind of
like earrings I think these are really
nice so the next thing I got was a x-ray
suit and I've been really in it to
ruffles at the moment so if you have as
well then this might be you as well it
is this it's like a a nude or like a
baby pink ruffled sleeve it's like a
bandeau fit and then like mussels loops
again and then it just goes into the
shore I literally love stuff like this I
think your look is so pretty and I love
that kind of like boho look when you
wear something like this again
the good curly messy updo like a big
pair of Hoops I'm so into that look
right now I just thought this was like a
very nice color because the eyelet when
these lipsticks so compare it with like
a nude lipstick even maybe that's those
earrings and just like some sandals
collected actually on the pair of
sandals in this color from last year so
I'm so looking forward to wearing this
and also I wanted to kind of suck in and
then the loose-fitting short kind of fit
of a playsuit to be really flattering as
well so if you think you like a similar
body type to me then definitely at check
this out I think it's so free I just
want to shimmy shimmy Yummie engage in
me young and the next thing I got was to
kind of go with something that I've got
from pretty little things I kind of like
was thinking in advance but I thought it
would go with a lot of things and also
I'll tell you like an outfit I've been
loving wearing at the moment but
basically I just got a plain white bando
like cross over bandeau top so I've got
this to go with kind of like I've got a
gum mesh
beings we just can't aware that the bar
being underneath but I've been really
loving at the moment is wearing up
Brando's or lycra products like this a
pair of like a loose fitted shorts and
then a really nice blazer I freaking
love Blazers i recently got like a
pinstripe one i've got a black one I
definitely want to get more because
there's such a comfortable jacket when
you when it's hot like this and you
don't want to be wearing like a very
hefty jacket but you want something so I
cover up with slightly then a blazer and
an oversized blazer I'm really really
loving especially with shorts I think
it's like like a very chic learner so
I've got this to potentially wear some
shorts and a blazer but kind of may need
to go over there like underneath
slightly more messy see-through tops and
I just got it in wipe this or it can't
go wrong with white and my 2008 it looks
like quite a big one so I think it'd be
quite flattering that yes so I think
thing that happens in more colors as
well so you're in the markets which is
like a plain band as this one is super
comfortable weather looks of it and then
the next thing I got was actually a
swimsuit now this might be quite hard to
it demonstrate almost not honest it's
just come undone so the next thing I got
was this swimsuit so this kind of
sleeves go like this and then this would
kind of go around your waist and then
these are the pants you can kind of
visualize it I've left the link to it
down below but one I'm a hunter not
comfortable just standing in like
swimsuit and it too if you click on the
link down below you'll be able to see
how it works on the model but I just
thought it looked super kind of
hugging you in and all the right places
again click the link down below and
you'll be able to see what it looks like
on the model so you know I mean and plus
I've been loving this lip ring detail
recently I thought that I could wear
like if I wanted to get glammed to beach
like we're from silver hoop so I could
match my swimsuit because I am that
person every time I hold it up it comes
from done yeah but I haven't tried this
one on it yet anyway just because
disorder any arrived the other day so
I'll let you know how it gets on but
again I'm sure I'll post pictures or
like something but I've been loving
since each other minute I feel like
everyone's coming out with me like
stylish one but almost making it like
more acceptable for us gals - you're
worse off like this and if you might
want a fashion statement so I really
like this one well and finally the last
thing I got from this card was actually
an oversized t-shirt and it's like in a
box past
you party blue here at denim if called
the destructive oversized key to opening
but literally it looks like this so
these bits kind of sit over your
shoulders and intersect hold up the
scene
these are fit to sit over your shoulders
it's such a comfortable fabric I'm not
even kidding but I love oversized
t-shirts I feel like they just make
sense a little safety blanket and if you
type them into your shoulders and kind
of like unroll them slightly then I know
I just like a look like fun it's got
like holes in it like I said it's a bit
destructive to you but I just thought I
really liked the color I really I've
worn it once already and it really made
my eyes kind my pop and stand out but
yes I think they did this in other
colors as well but in this here's well I
never like to wear anything that's too
thick heavy going to make me feel like
very sweaty and uncomfortable so I love
a good oversized t-shirt and this one
was just kind of different to anything
that I've had like with these straps as
well but if you want to see more what it
looks like on it then the link is down
below
so those everything that I've got from
this guy did now finally we can move on
to I got from a free little thing so
again I've got another swimsuit and this
time it is one of these ones I feel like
these are everywhere at the moment so
this is like the top half of it and then
it attaches to the bottom and then you
get these like high-rise bikini bottoms
and I got this in black and white as you
can see I have actually ordered another
one from it somewhere else and just in
plain black I just think there's such a
flattering style swimming costume I know
that they do those notes on cards I
think there's like a pink one as well
which is super pretty but I'm quite like
a monotone like my monochrome monitor in
monochrome badly so I got black and
white and I just feel like this is like
a really flattering like I said nice
swimsuit
super stylish as well so I'm excited to
try that putting on the holy ball and
now this next thing is going to be quite
hard for me to show you so I will hold
up but I definitely kind of try this on
all my time of the month if you know
what it means but if this jutsu I will
insert a clip of me holding it up silly
but I plan it I'll go through it now
kind of what it looks like but it is a
jump see rather than okay see so it does
get all the way down to the leg so that
is kind of at the top of it these bits
actually it's high around with any of
the straps here and then it's like this
all the way down like a really long wide
leg like ruffled honestly it looks
absolutely stunning
I definitely want to get a white blazer
to go with it to obtain white one
they're going to do city but Shivani
type jacket thing but oh my god guys if
you're like super tall as well I'm not
super tall if you were I think this
would look bu I'm loving a flared leg at
the moment and this one definitely has
one and again with the ruffles I think
it's so pretty is so flattering and you
can kind of adjust the tightness of it
as well it is like a bit of a halter
neck one so I just it literally Ã«cause
me to my holiday I cannot wait to post
like a picture size though on my holiday
and this so yeah stay tuned for that I
just thought this absolutely of gorge so
earlier I showed you that white bandeau
top and that's because I've got it to go
underneath this which is just like a
mesh orange kind of a bandeau top it has
got like hot like it is more of the mesh
material if you felt like you weren't
being the Rihanna wild thoughts go with
it I ordered this before that video came
out and asked let me like oh my god I
can like see her nail and just stroll
down and be like making it in there
naked but I really loved if I thought
this to be super quick to just throw on
top with like a bikini or something when
you just want to cover up slightly has a
really cool kind of like sled sleeve I'm
loving orange at the moment it's so
appropriate for summer so I've been
really like excited and wanting to wear
this out so yeah this get like a pair of
orange sunglasses and some wear band
around your head bad girl RiRi is there
yeah another thing I got is another bag
which kind of little bit more like to go
and you're probably thinking why'd you
get that but initially I got this for
when I went when I went to Ascot the
other day but then it didn't really go
with what I was going to wear and then I
totally just changed my outfit anywhere
any but I thought this would be a super
nice with like that rustles places
because it's actually technically that
place is quite plain and if you just run
into a log of the litter I got this it's
like a what's it called a champagne like
glitter classified I just thought it
added a little bit of like glam to an
outfit you could kind of pair it with
like gold or silver accessories because
it's kind of got a little bit too color
on it
like everywhere I just thought this
would be really really cute with like
yeah pair of sandals that kind of crazy
just to add a little bit glitter and
glam to your outfit on like a summer
evening or if you're going out or
something like that I just thought this
is really good at size as well so yeah a
little bit of glitter and then do sound
and really thinking why they get this
for like the summer but sometimes I do
just like to sit around in a jumper and
short well it's not too hot but it's not
that warm
wait when it's not that cold i watch and
say well it's not too hot but it's
almost too hot like sometimes I just
like to ever have jump in short so I
just got to clean it swept it in baby
pink and red which is literally my
favorite color I definitely made sure to
get them oversized because I didn't want
to be wearing tight jumpers but I do
love to wear loose-fitting crewneck so I
just got one in pink and red and they
did hundreds of other colors but yeah
sometimes I just like a sweater to throw
on and you know what the English weather
is like who the hell that knows when
it's going to be boiling hot or and it's
like right now
pencil me down the drain but being a
final item that I got is again like I
never like roughly type thing but is
this top I thought this is so cute it is
why it is like strategy it shoulders and
then you have like that gap in your
shoulders and then it really puffy and
loose fitted sleeve and then Advocate
little peplum detail at the bottom I
just thought this was so cute so
flattering like and such a comfortable
fabric for the heat it's so lightweight
I'm not even kidding
so I thought this would look really
really nice again I just I picture
everything with like me in an updo and
like hoop earrings but I just thought it
was like really cute and any I like a
bit of a chance like just makes your
boobs look really good in this top you
know so wear that in mind
yeah just thought you can pair this in
the past denim shorts that you pair of
leggings or something want to see these
kind of tops I think are like staples
for the summer because they're so
lightweight and comfortable and they
literally go with everything in a kind
of add like they look like you put loads
up in and it's really just like a simple
top I know that sounds really strange
the I mean most tops that you just put
on an active color pull the whole outfit
together
and everything else but you may look
quite basic yeah I'm just like
visualizing this was like a bright lip
really minimal makeup and just looking
super cute and it would look so much at
the time I mean whenever you wear white
and you turned it looks good but that is
everything that I've got so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know if you want to see a lot water me
