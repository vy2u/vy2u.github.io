a slightly different session today I
thought that I would kind of film this
just kind of sat down as if I was a Miss
like showing like my fret we'll see is a
lecture in my friends but just like
showing my friends all these recent
items that I've got if you can tell by
the title all of these items I feel
crept into some special categories box
loads of them a bit more comic glance
but like all from really affordable
shops and stuff like that but all kinds
of appropriate for summer and accessible
before we start though I feel like
millions of questions on this so I'll
just say lashes I'm wearing are Raquel
from su WT which I've literally recently
just fallen back in love with and on my
list is be a buxom full on lip polish in
Leslie actually how gorgeous eyes like a
rose gold lip gloss I've been loving
this at the moment as well let me know
if you would want to see it like a
beauty kind of current Beauty favorite
type video because I've had I'm getting
real spider just thing a deed clattering
all of my legs when really narrowing it
down to my favorite product so let me
don't you want to see that but anyway
let's forget on a list of all so first
things first a skewed bits from you can
Instagram shop but it called a mesh gear
boutique they are based in Australia but
I do have a discount code if you guys
can use the code Rachel xx you can get
15% off so saving you their money honey
so let me show you I got because I'm so
excited for these but they went into
discomfort agent I feel like I was out
folks that whole time anyway so these
bits of a mesh key boutique this is the
item I was like most excitable I feel
like a loads of places that do stuff
like this at the moment but this is
their what's it called the draped metal
mesh alternate oh my god it in gold it
is sparkly it is so extra I can really
it see this beam like quite like a glam
festival at times out there because it's
really lightweight that you look at the
strap detailing it's all got like
diamonds in it and you can see that you
all have got diamonds in it so kinda
like obviously holders around your neck
and then these bit tight up and strap up
at the back literally just imagine
yourself gold hoops this drenched in
like golden oil or like shimmer powder
as festival
I can't really like envision myself
doing that and I hope that I do do that
at some point I literally and loved'
there I feel like a few places to do
this but this is the only place I saw
that did like the diamond strap and I'm
literally in love so I cannot wait to
wear that and the next thing I got was a
play see I actually got a couple of
plays it from now I thought that they
did a really cute selection so this one
is that she just like a white Bardot
type of placing it over layered kind of
light fabric it's like a big trend in
the moment and I love white with like a
tan so I thought this would be so acute
just for like holiday or just lots of me
like weight like a jacket and trainers
is quite casual as well as in perfect
for summer they definitely did like
loads more colors of this but yeah this
fabric is just so you can tell it's
really like a really good quality and I
feel like it would be a super flattering
it fit as well so yeah definitely check
out the other colors that they do I'm
just a plain Jane and gold white and the
other pages that I've got is this it's
like that cowl neck one keep telling
quite looking like the CalNet is color
literally like it asking me to do our
matching copper eye and like a
newsletter and glass like you know the
drill no it's just a satin play suit
with a cowl neck it kind of holds necks
at the back and it is a buckler just
wanna this literally makes me want to do
take up all my makeup and redo it and
make it all in this color again I
definitely think they did this in a few
of colors and the fit of this looks
really nice and I'm really loving this
satin at the moment as well love like a
deep coppery of bronze for summer if
they like with a tan or even if you were
slightly paler this might make you look
more turn this is super pretty so so
nice maybe like a belt as well or
something I think that'd be really nice
and lastly the thing I got from there
was a of bodysuit are we interested in
this it looks like plain cream my baby
look really close it's like a really
shimmery fabric I thought this would
just be so nice to talk on with like a
pair of jeans like a cream belt maybe
it's something that like that and it's
really lightweight I think it's kind of
quite high rise as well which is quite
flattering on some people so yeah I'm
sure if you can really wear a bra with
this
I think it's so pretty and I don't
actually own a buy own like so many body
foods but not a bodysuit like this I
think this is a really nice like pretty
alternative for my steering's just like
brown up because it's like glam but not
too bad because I feel like the sparkles
make it glam but it's just kind of like
quite understated that's why I mean so
go to the bit I've got from a pesky
boutique I've linked them at down below
and my dad drove a discount code is 15%
off which is Rachel X oh yeah moving on
oh but moving on it - what am i favorite
online retailer which is pretty little
thing so I mainly got kind of festive
Liat based clothes and then a necklace
from pair the first thing I got was like
holter net please suit
so again white I didn't really think
about when I was ordering the other
white places I already had a white place
food atomic sense
so well done mate yeah it's just like a
little pest limit finish and it's just
shorts white halterneck I'm not actually
even it tried this on yeah literally
it's all just been sitting in my room
ready to film at this haul for you guys
yeah I just thought that'd be so nice on
holiday and again with a tan super
flattering finish I do quite like a
halter neck at the moment because I
always forget about necklaces and I
thought I could wear like a big oops a
dead like my silver ones that you guys
see all the time or be a big gold ones
that variegatedness all by the way baby
even want to know where they're from
there yeah it's a brilliant items of
stretchy material again I'm not actually
sure with this on it they had other
colors I assume that they do could this
pretty little thing they normally do
lots of colours in those if they're like
basic stuff like this no I just thought
this would be a cute for summer or likes
going out in I feel like I'm going to be
wearing a lot of places throughout the
moment because it's not like freezing
anymore but it's not boiling so it's
easily nice with like some heels but you
could just up dress it down and that's
just like this can you tell okay so you
guys might seen this already because I
wore it to Sarah Ashe Cross shoot the
other day but this is the like red rail
a jacket I saw this and I was like oh my
god how festival and like summer
appropriate is visit is so nice I love
red as you
I can probably see that how Isis it I
feel like you could wear this is like an
all-black outfit it's like a statement
piece of likes and gold hoops or
something or like how I sold it like for
a festival so I had like mansions and
raffles which are included in here as
well and all that stuff so I thought
this is so nice something quite
different for me and I really like it so
shimmy shimmy yay and then I got this
like matching ATCO orbit I thought was
so acute it's a black kind of a ruffled
skirt as you guys can see a ship on a
material so super lightweight perfect in
the summer for like heat and stuff if
you don't anything like clinging to you
this is really cute and then it came
with just like a at minute a little
Bardot pop so it's actually a little
matching outfit they definitely did
other patterns of this so it definitely
have a look if you think that'd be cute
I don't got me really cute flight
festivals again or just like in the
summer just walking around like a little
matching cold just like a jacket over
your shoulders I better get to be like
understated but you look really put
together and like you put a person but
really you're just wearing a black top a
black skirt and I'm talking about and
it'd be a final thing like rocking
pretty little things actually a necklace
I love layered jewelry or like layering
jewelry if I do wearing nothing since
well if I click on that tangle in so it
looks like this let me not hold up and
show you it was gold is like one of the
legs but across one of them's got like a
Halfmoon type thing and the other just
rates down I thought this was just so
prestigious to like well like judging at
tops or something like that and the
festival season up like maybe would like
a gold choker as well so you've got like
all the jewelry going on yeah I've been
looking for something like this for ages
and I just thought this was really
pretty there's some pretty little things
that are super affordable so again like
everything else I haven't linked it down
below
okay the next few things I got are from
boom so the first thing I got you're
probably thinking like how is that some
appropriate but it's just like a black
chiffon shirt really boring really not
interesting whiteboarding kid area
you might be like me you know we like
you don't want to wear a jacket but it's
not quite cold enough it's not quite
warm enough not to wear a jacket but you
just need it something on I've been
loving shirts whether it's like a
checkered shirt or something I thought
this would be a really nice alternative
it's like I said it's a bishop on
material so super lightweight and also
like a couple of months ago I put a
really pretty brother from misguided
it's like red or something I thought
this would be really cute like you know
you want to show off like you're pretty
bralette but not be like a little richer
I know what this would be nice because
it's kind of like seen through ish base
like a breeze good material eh it's not
that these really don't think it's a
completely share so like if you just
have some of the buttons undone run up
the sleeves just something really
lightweight for the summer I really
liked it and I don't actually have a
plain black shirt and they thought
they'd kind of go with everything really
understated yeah to that crowd but why I
got that and then the next thing I got
from burger was a pair of boyfriend
jeans that cowlick distressed and ripped
them I didn't have one in this color I
do have a pair of like mom boyfriend
distressed jeans but never like really
really really pale and then I've got
some that I like blue and white like
bleach I didn't just have any preview
ones and V cool and these are a really
like relaxed fit and they have like just
the amount of ripich that I was after so
so I'm glad I got now I feel like blue
who actually doing really good jeans so
definitely check them out if you haven't
already but yeah they're just like baby
blue I always roll up the bottoms of
them but just like really relaxed fit
jeans because like I said it would
summer and still unlike the specials
this would look really cool you can do
that whole fishnet trend I don't
personally do that or have done that but
if you want this feels like a good
amount of rips to be able to show them
off and also yeah like I just think
they're really good so that festivals if
you don't want to wear shorts just like
an Aries
alternative if that makes sense you
still like not getting too hot and like
it likes chasing whatever by the way my
lighting gets in and out I'm using
natural light and literally just feel
like I'm sat here talking to you guys if
you were here so I hope you appreciate
that and then the two final things I got
from boot were jewelry again so I got
this body it chain so this bit time
around like
your neck then this drapes down like the
middle and it's got diamonds you can see
like little gems going down I think
there's three in total one at the top
one in the middle why the bottom and
then this bit kind of like wraps around
your body so almost as if you're wearing
like a harness type thing obviously to
wear it sort of like rounding it round
your body type thing I just thought this
was cool like you were wearing like a
brawler or something like that and you
just wanted a lot of jewelry could layer
it with that one or just like another
choker on the top but I split with super
dainty super pretty
so Jessica's little summer staple or
expectable staple if you're wearing
something quite low-cut which sometimes
you guys noticed I did they still kinda
just like a drape down the center I
think with sexy quite pretty in and then
finally the last thing I got from a
boohoo was these bad boys these are the
biggest hoops I've ever owned and I
didn't even realize that was that big
rifle and I kind of just thought they
were like average size but as you can
see they're like quite twist they're
like twisted that's the reason why
that's the reason why I've got them I
just wanted like a pair of twisted hoops
not realizing oh my god what an eyelash
not realizing that they were so massive
so you can see that how big they are on
me but massive hoops they feel like Oh
such a trend in a moment and these are
really really nice like they're not too
heavy I don't feel like they're drooping
my ears on anything that's super
lightweight I think they're really good
quality as well so she's been looking
for a pair of like a massive hoops
I checked these ones out because
everything I got from boohoo and now I
got accused bit from a soul so from a
source I kind of like two of the same
two
genres I think I got two guys of my
bosses and two more denim items the Sun
masters I got these ones I am obsessed
with yes honey
red is one my favorite color but also my
alpha bells rang to Thursday
like there was all kind of bread and I
just wanted it perhaps like red lens
sunglasses I really hope these are still
in stock because I'm obsessed with them
I'm colored lenses are we in at the
moment especially like the yellow ones
that keep seeing and all of that so I'm
loving the red vibe another pair of fun
website got a kind of clear lens but
these ones are a bit more like laptops
these also from April's and I call their
oversized square son well since the pale
brown lens so I've been loving the kind
of flat top oversized vibe and the clear
lens really called to me because I feel
like when I said before clear lenses are
we in a trend at the moment I just
thought these which is kind of sass you
know you can just sit back and relax and
be like how's your mum young should you
June I'm just kidding yeah those is like
all the Sony's that I go really hoping
if you guys like them that they're still
in store we had the other two things I
got like I said we're like denim items
the first thing I've got was some these
are both actually from new look but from
a source if that makes sense because a
so stock new look
ASOS stock the new look why do I say
that
a CIL's stock new look products so if
these out of stock in a sauce then check
in new look but I got these pair of like
light distressed denim jeans who the
hell knew that new look shorts would be
it so as being a comfortable these are
literally like the most favorite pair of
shorts I've ever bought they don't show
you a bummed out really conservative
debris it nice fit as well
so what comfortable I love the color
like the pale denim color I love the
distress at the front it's not too
distressed that you're like me showing
out your pants or anything like that
like a that's so comfortable a really
good fit I'm so glad these are like such
a good thing that I bought you know and
it just fits right it's comfortable
everything looks good thank you
new look so your denim shorts and then
the final thing I got from a source was
actually a pair of mom jeans but these
ones are white and not actually tried
them on yet so fingers got that base
pair but these are just like some white
mom Jean I'm seeking a plan to roll them
up again I wanted I didn't actually have
a pair of white distressed jeans I
thought the name look really nice with
the tan and the summer something
lightweight not too tight so yes these
ones again from new looks if they're
anything like the shorts but I don't
know if they'd be fit yet because I
haven't tried them on and I'm hopefully
I would have interests because I have
tried them on yeah it's just there was a
couple of bricks like one than me one of
the thigh and again unlike the other
side and I just this was just a
knowledge that was missing from my
wardrobe I just didn't have a pair of
white loose fit distressed jeans and I
really really really love white jeans so
these were a mess Inc and it'd be a
final item I bought and if you finalized
I got one pair of shoes I literally died
when I saw these they are so fast for me
they are like a red sock boot and I
thought you like going glam to festivals
and stuff like that this would be
amazing and I just thought that these
would just be a maze anyway like a
statement shoe with any of the pair of
jeans I wore and just like a plane
outfit red lipstick summer evening
outfit sorted yeah I literally am in
love with them and they are from ego you
know you have a discount growing em I'm
not sure I do anymore but they're super
affordable shoes anyway it's literally
obsessed them I knew they were out of
stock for age thing so it's in popular
they did other colors as well and a sock
and shoe it's like a lycra finish and
they feel like they just literally cling
to your foot and you're not slipping
you're not going anywhere which I really
appreciate because otherwise my feet
start to help way sooner than they
should because I might cling on to dear
life inside the shoe but no these are
super comfortable so far they've read
which my favorite color and I love them
survived everything I collect she has
