at the moon we'd go to bed in my arms
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I was kind of like rummaging
through my makeup and I was looking at
kind of new things that I had and all
the things that I'd forgot I had and
recently I got the models own dare to
bear nude like I'll show you it's
essentially an eyeshadow palette that is
filled with matte browns and I normally
a bit of a shimmer girl I always go trim
it so I thought I would do something
matte and most kind of like cool toned
Brown but also rummaged in my drawer and
found a load of my NYX lip lingerie so
if you have either of these products I'm
not sure if you have the pallet yet I
think that comes out really soon so this
is just a look to get you excited and
inspired for that as well but I know
these are super easy to get hold of and
I've not done a dark clip in a while and
I feel like as the months go on and
autumn is approaching this would kind of
get the ball rolling so yeah it's kind
of like a soft cut crease dark clip
tutorial I really hope you guys enjoy if
you like the look of this makeup look
then please keep watching
so to begin we're going to start with
the clear vase and go ahead and do our
brows and prime our eyes as always
products are linked down below then
we're taking this dead to bear our
shadow palette from models own as you
can see it's filled with so many
gorgeous matte brown colors and I'm
going to start with this medium brown
color on a flat brush like this and with
my eyes open I am just going to define
and cut my crease
going in with this light brown color and
a fluffy brush I'm just going to use
that to slowly begin to diffuse out the
line then going back in with that medium
brown color and a pencil brush I'm just
going to use that to create almost like
a gradient between the light brown and
then the dark brown line that we created
and going back in with that fluffy brush
to make sure it is all blended out
seamlessly and then just going back in
each time building up the intensity that
I want and then obviously going back
into the fluffy brush again to diffuse
it all out then going in with the
darkest Brown in the palette I'm going
to use that to go back over the line
that we created as our new crease just
to make sure it is super cut and super
defined
for our lid color I am taking the palest
shade in the palette and just pressing
it onto my lid using the brush that came
with the palette and just using that
also to erase any shadow that may have
fallen down it to really define it the
crease then I'm just taking a wipe and
wiping away any excess shadow to give us
a really nice sharp line and a base for
when we apply our liquid eyeliner the
liquid liner I'm taking the Maybelline
precise liquid liner pen in the color
Forest Brown as this is kind of like a
matte Brown look I thought I would go
with brown eyeliner today and it is a
super super complimentary on the eyes
and something a bit softer maybe if you
don't like black so also perfect for
back-to-school and I'm just skipping
through this because I've done it
previously in a tutorials and I always
link my winged liner tutorial down below
but just creating a simple cat eye
winged liner then I'm just applying
mascara and you obviously you can just
leave it there if you want to but I love
a good pair of false lashes and these
are from violet was I think the style
that I used is called sexy and I know it
but I think that out of stock but house
of lashes Iconix are so similar onto the
skin I am it using the Illamasqua matte
veil primer like I said as this is a
matte look we want our skin to be matte
as well and I love this primer and I'm
just buffing it into my skin using it my
Real Techniques expert face brush as
always the foundation I'm at taking my
Mac Studio Fix in NC 40 you may think
this looks quite tan but I do go in with
a lighter concealer to kind of even it
out and make it appear a lot lighter on
my skin but obviously I am normally fake
tan so it does match my neck on my hands
and everything like that but I was just
blending that in with a Beauty Blender
for concealer I'm using the NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade vanilla as
you can see it's a lot lighter than my
skin tone so when I blend it all out
everything kind of balances out on my
skin and I don't appear so Orange
so if you want super matte skin and your
makeup to last obviously you're going to
be sitting your makeup with the laura
mercier translucent setting powder I'm
just using this underneath my eyes with
a tapered brush this is from Sigma I do
always link where I get my brushes from
down below and I'm just baking
underneath my eyes but then just dusting
it all over my face to make sure
everything is set in place for contour
I'm taking the Kat Von D shade and light
palette I was like I said rummaging
through my makeup drawer and realized I
hadn't used this in ages and just look
how much of a nice color that is to
contour with and I'm just using this
brush from zoeva as well to do this it's
just one of those flat top contour
brushes and yet just contouring my
cheeks and just the tops of my forehead
basically anything that I want to appear
slimmer then it to warm up my skin I'm
at taking Mac give me Sun bronzer and a
duo fiber brush just because I feel that
blends it the most evenly and softly
into the skin for blusher I'm taking
this little blusher here from NYX and it
is in the shade angel I don't think they
stock that in the places that sell like
NYX now I had to find it on Amazon and
or on their website but I felt like even
though this is a matte look I couldn't
go without a highlighter but I didn't
want it to be too intense so I went to
the hourglass ambient lighting powder in
it brilliant as that just gives more of
a subtle glow for the eyes to finish off
I'm mixing these two colors together on
a pencil brush and just buffing that
along my lower lash line connecting it
back to the wing so it all connects
together and then I'm going in with
brown mascara and this is the Horten
naughty mascara from Mac on my lower
lashes as well it just is something a
bit more natural and a bit softer and
these are the finished eyes I'm so happy
with how they turned out I'm really
trying to improve my cut crease game so
I'm going to keep doing cut crease
tutorials every now and again it's a
practice for the lip I'm at taking this
NYX lip lingerie in a beauty mark and
just applying that all over you could
use a lip liner but with liquid
lipsticks I find sometimes they're
unnecessary if I had to wear a lip liner
with this it would probably either be a
stone or chestnut from Mac
so this is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed it make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you did and
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in the next one bye guys
