just doing a everyday glam look today
I'm just kidding this is my first
installment of Halloween makeup and I
thought what was the trend last year and
I feel like desi pack and set the bar
with that melted skull that she did and
this year because of the film it
everyone has been doing the Pennywise
crown so I thought why not combine
together and do a melted Pennywise crown
I feel like this is for those of us that
still want to be like a little bit glam
but want to be scariest thug2 so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial if I'm being completely honest
I don't use any face plates in this I
use all makeup if I could do it again I
would use face paints but then I was
kind of looking at pictures of Pennywise
and his makeup is a little bit crap too
so I feel like I'm just gonna roll with
it and pretend that that was the look I
was like trying to go for if you like
the look of this makeup look then please
give it a thumbs up and share with
someone who loves to be glad that loves
to be scary at the same time that you
feel would enjoy this look but without
further ado if you want to know how I
got this look then please keep watching
okay we're gonna start with the glam
side of our face first so I've already
gone ahead and done my brows and primed
my eyes for this look we are using the
morphe 35o 2 palette and this orange
shade here oh my god guys I think the
palette came out today if you haven't
got the palette yet 100% recommend that
you do because this is gorgeous and I'm
sticking to the kind of red theme and
this palette is perfect for that
speaking of which I am taking the like
bright red shade from the palette and
just buffing it back and forth and to my
crease and making sure to blend it out
with the previous brush we are gonna be
doing like a cut crease look so it's
okay if you're a little bit messy on the
lid because the more color you apply
they're kind of better the cut crease
will look so now going in with this dark
brown shade again just to build up the
depth and the definition in the crease
and kind of sticking towards all the
same colors and then finally finishing
off with a black to really really deepen
up the crease and create that kind of
harsh cut crease effect and then again
blending out with my previous brushes
then we are gonna take a little bit of
concealer that we're gonna use in our
face this is just the Bourjois healthy
mix one I probably would recommend
actually using one that was slightly
thicker because this one almost have
blended in with the eyeshadows as you
can see it wasn't so much of a problem
because we are going in with a white
eyeshadow on the top but it just meant
that the base wasn't like
proper like clean to start with but now
I'm taking the BH Cosmetics it take me
to Brazil palette and this massive white
eyeshadow which is just perfect for this
because we're going to need a lot of
white and it's a matte shade as well and
I'm just pressing that on top of where
we put the concealer just to really
mattify it create a really clean base
and then going back in with the black
eye shadow you could have used the black
from the take me to Brazil or the moth
you want either it doesn't matter
just remember really it's small shader
brush to a further deepen up the crease
and then just soften it out with a
fluffier brush then we can take a wipe
just to clean up the edge because we are
gonna be doing a wing and you guys know
this is my favorite technique to avoid
any fallout or ruining any face makeup
always doing my eyes first so I'm gonna
be using these two products today for
eyeliner and lashes and while the glue
dries we can move on to at the face so
this for this I'm gonna be moisturizing
my face using my L'Oreal extraordinary
oil moisturizer just cuz we are gonna be
using quite a lot of like dry paints and
makeup and stuff so I do want to keep my
skin it's super hydrated and this is a
really hydrating primer as well this is
from Stila is their one-step prime and
I'm just buffing that into my skin I do
let my skin just dry for a little bit
before I go with this next product which
is the NYX wonder pencil essentially
it's just a nude colored pencil and I'm
gonna use it this to kind of draw all my
lines on my face so it's not gonna be
too difficult to cover up or anything
and now I'm just gonna start by drawing
the kind of melting effect I was looking
at kind of melted faces on googled for
reference and obviously like I said in
the beginning this was inspired by desi
Perkins melted skull so just to get the
shape and stuff it's always good to look
at a picture for foundation I'm gonna
take the efendi Beauty foundation and I
did put it on to like a low dish because
I am gonna kind of be like a painting it
onto my skin to start with just because
that way I can kind of go into all these
little gaps that like a big brush or a
sponge wouldn't do so that's what I'm
doing here I'm just using a little
concealer brush and applying the
foundation into all the kind of drips
and kind of going along all the lines so
I get a really a smooth and clean cut
edge and above my brows as well of
course because that's a really kind of
clean cut edge too
but then I'm just going in with a damp
Beauty Blender to kind of like fill in
the center of my face
then seal it like I used earlier
I'm taking the Bourjois healthy mix
concealer by the way guys I have left
all the products that I'm using it down
below and all their shades in case you
think they're the same as me and you
want to know the shades that I'm using
but then I'm just gonna go ahead and set
everything in place with a powder this
is the RCM a and no color powder which
is essentially a no kind of powder
it's a translucent powder which is super
super finely milled and I love it and
then I didn't want anything to be too
too Brown I did kind of want to just
stick to like the contour but I am
wanting sums of warmth so I'm taking Mac
harmony blusher as my contour just to
really kind of narrow down at my
cheekbones and hollow them out but also
taking it up on to my forehead as well
and because it is a crown I did kind of
want to stick with like the white theme
so what perfect product to use
then the nikkietutorials and over a
highlighter and glazed donut because
this side of the face is supposed to be
quite glam and this highlighter really
does make you glow to the quads and make
you look super glam but now I've done
the face I can finish up the eyes so I'm
taking that red shade on a big fluffy
brush and then at pressing this dark
brown right into my lashline that's just
to finish off the look so that is that
side of the face done and now we can
move on to the clown side first of all
I'm gonna put these contacts in I do
recommend yellow because that is the one
that penny what Pennywise has yellow
eyes and they left the link to these
down below and then going over the lines
that I did with the NYX pencil just with
a white one because we are going to be
painting our whole face white so this
just makes it a lot easier and to help
block out my brows I'm just taking the
Too Faced glitter glue and then
depressing my RC MA and no color powder
on the top this just helps get rid of
the texture that your hairs give
although you are kind of meant to use a
pretty sick but I did not do that
anyways but now I'm gonna move on to
kind of drawing the rest of the features
onto the face so I was looking at a
picture of penny wise on google for
reference so I just drew on the nose his
big smile extending my bottom lip
drastically during the lines connecting
up to my eyes and also making my top lip
appear a bit smaller and also drawing on
his big teeth and now to fill in my face
white this is what it's like a gel paint
from Make Up For Ever I do recommend
probably using like a white face paint
because it's a lot easier to get off
because believe me this was a pain in
the ass to take off but it was super
super pigmented and you basically just
want anything white that's gonna be a
super bright on your
then I just went ahead and set
everything with that RC m8 no color
powder again and for the red I use the
NYX and vivid brights color in the shade
bad blood pretty appropriate for a
Halloween look but I'm just filling in
all the places that were red so it
essentially has smile and extending
obviously my bottom lip and the
connection up to the eye then I'm taking
this a black eyeshadow for our eyes I'm
literally just packing this on with a
big fluffy brush I didn't even use a
base because the Messier is the scarier
looks and as you can see that literally
took two seconds now I'm taking a black
pencil for my waterline if this is a Mac
feline it's literally just a matte black
pencil and I also use this to draw on
his super thin eyebrows that looked like
the brows everyone used to have back in
the day
now I'm gonna fill in my nose again with
the same NYX vivid brights and bread
paint thingamabob and I'm also filling
in just half my nose because one half
has melted off or it is kind of more
than normal one and then I'm also using
that red to draw the kind of you know we
just drew that connection going up to
the eye this is kind of it extending
upwards so as you can see it just goes
up and I did do it past the melted just
for like a little added effect but
that's essentially what we're doing here
now onto the teeth and just again it
taking that white and just filling in
his two big teeth and then to a little
teeth underneath and then filling in the
kind of gaps in his teeth of that makes
sense with the Tarte TARDIS eyeliner
that we were using before just to kind
of block it out and give the appearance
of like a deeper mouth because obviously
my teeth aren't really there they're on
my lip so we want to make it look as
foreign as possible and then it's
totally up to you what you do I decided
to add a bit of shading using a matte
brown eyeshadow and then went in with a
little bit of black to kind of create
the appearance of for a more smiley
cheeks and then shading it out but
essentially that is it and to me I
thought that was pretty easy thank you
