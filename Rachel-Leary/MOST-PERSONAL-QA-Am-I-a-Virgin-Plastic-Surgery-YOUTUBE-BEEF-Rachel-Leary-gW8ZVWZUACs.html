today we're doing a super personal Q and
a cuz I feel like I haven't done one in
ages and you guys love these kind of
videos where you get to know me a bit
better I love doing these kind of beers
cuz I think they're super fun and you
get to see like a side of me that I
might not portray on a camera so you can
find out some more insights into my life
so I asked you guys to ask me it's some
invasive personal questions so I'm gonna
go through them ask them now if I don't
answer your question it may be because
it wasn't personal enough or like if it
was making it relates to kind of when to
avoid those questions so I want these to
be a bit more like about me and then
like details about me
so I told you to comment on my latest
Instagram post questions so I'm gonna go
through them and then I'm gonna go
through the ones on Twitter as well so
if you ask me a question and it was
personal then stay tuned okay sir tarah
Josey asked what is the one
characteristic that is major channel for
you and a guy like say you meet him he
ticks all the boxes but he has that
characteristic that's enough to put you
off love you girl love you too um I
think if he takes all the right boxes so
I'm guessing that's the classic like
that good luck game they're funny
they're kind but you know all the stuff
that you look for but I think the one
characteristic you know what I think if
they're really if they've got no manners
or they're just really rude then I just
I don't think that's gonna work or if
they don't get on with my friends I
think that would be enough to put me off
because that's like a massively
important factor you just got to get on
with my friends and be able to socialize
with them because I love like group
socializing situations and it's better
when everyone can just get on you know a
Leah bunion bunion bunion says what's
the boyfriend search um there is none
but complicated Sophie Edwards says what
age did you lose your virginity and did
it happen in an awkward way all my
friends that know I'm not gonna go into
too much detail but all my friends that
know me will like laugh because they
know how
happened but I think I was this 16 maybe
at time and yeah it was kind of awkward
and it was on I'll never forget because
it was on a Valentine's Day so for ages
I was called Valentine girl so you can
think that's cute or awkward but I think
it was kind of awkward Ashley bong bong
yeah says would you ever get butt
implants implants no I'd never get butt
implants but would I get like fat
transfer maybe but then I'd feel like
I'd have to speak about it because if I
suddenly became mega rich and was able
to do like all that kind of stuff which
I probably would just because life's too
short and if you're uncomfortable with
your body like do whatever the hell you
want but I would obviously say then
that's what I got dunks I would hate for
you guys to look at me and think it was
like an unrealistic expectation or
whatever so no but no no two bad ones
Edgar Samantha 23 says is there any
youtubers you don't like and why um yeah
I think maybe a couple of people why it
will either just be because I met them
in person and it wasn't the same as like
online so I was just kind of like okay
like you've not like done anything wrong
just not the person I thought you were
so we'll move on from that and I don't
know I think some people are big like a
baby critical and contradiction and like
contradict themselves a lot with the way
that they speak to their followers and
then what they actually like do if that
makes sense so for that reason there are
like a couple that I just feel like we
don't get on but that's like I'm I'm
sure there's plenty that don't like me
or I know this and that don't like me
like people just don't mind you know and
I just and it doesn't bother either
party I don't think so many surgery
questions okay zelich dot C says which
part of your body are you most insecure
with and would you want to get surgery
for it by the way I love you
um maybe I feel like just my body in
general I'm kind of into
but I get surgery for it if it was
making me really uncomfortable than 100%
I've always wanted slightly more like
toned arms but I feel like that's kind
of achievable at the gym so I'm just
gonna work more on that I'm not like
body confident really asshole and never
really have been I feel like if it got
to a point in my life where I still
wasn't any just getting on and I want to
meet people and I felt like it was
holding me back then maybe I would I
don't know I'm not really thinking about
that now I literally just turned 21
how about back off says and did you ever
get into an intimate moment with a girl
love you
um I kissed like all my friends I'm sure
you were and me and my friends just like
touch each other all the time is like
jokes but I do love my friends so maybe
now I'm just kidding um I've kissed
girls and stuff like all the other kind
of questions on my Instagram aren't like
that personal so I'm gonna go move on to
Twitter wait it's like Toria Legree Chi
says do you have a type in guys and if
so what is it um I like like to think
that I have a type
it definitely isn't if that makes sense
in my head of C my ideal type is someone
that can make me laugh is like gorgeous
tall dark and handsome maybe like a few
tattoos their facial hair and works
really hard kind of has their own I
think someone slightly older than me so
they have their kind of own self
established already or whatever but that
doesn't that's not really reflected on
what I've been through or who I've been
with but I feel like that was all that
has been like my type and my head but
you love and I'm not like who you like
it that's just I don't know you just
kind of connect with people on a
different level sometimes and your type
just goes out the window
kwo 3 says are you a virgin well the
fact I just told you when I lost my
virginity would imply Noorie
Jamie VIII says number one life lesson
it's so far I love your videos thanks
girl um life lesson so far I don't know
maybe just like everything's not what
see I know that sounds very like what I
like mysterious but I mean serious like
weight that you can apply that to a lot
of things like what people get up to
just the way that people behave I don't
know just I feel like everything's not
what it is do you know what I mean I've
been watching too many conspiracy
theories too so that's probably why I'm
thinking that I can't really think of
another lesson maybe just like don't lie
because it always gets found out maybe
but yeah something about things on what
they seem people lie gotta move forward
see the bigger picture the same girl
actually asked me like a few questions
as in this is the girl that asked me if
I was a virgin and she actually asked me
the most personal questions so that's
exactly what I wanted so props to you
Lauren but she says what is your boob
size and what shoe size are you boob I'm
an eager shoe size I'm a six Chrissy
Jennifer said how many X's do you have
well I've never really been in like a
long-term serious relationship if I
actually count like people that I've
been out with I could probably count
them on one hand and I feel like 1 2 3 4
like relationship we then broke up
ex-boyfriend
I'd like seen people and stuff where
that doesn't really count yeah so I
think for Sarah Gregory says when was
the first time you got drunk um back in
primary school not prime school
secondary school but there was always
like a few people in our year that had
like big parties every year that you
could always be like count on to happen
and expect it to be invited to so I
think it was probably
like yeah night maybe when Lambrini and
wkd were like a thing and if you could
like get some from like an older friend
that you had it was pretty cool so I
feel like when I was probably like
fifteen at one of those big parties that
was super hyped about every year Gemma I
like this question
Gemma Jones said most invasive
experience with a guy while clubbing I
know Sydney guys are in your face but
what boy what our boys in the UK like
too so I can one and Sydney springs to
mind but I feel like there's obviously
been a few occasions when you're just
trying to leave or walk away from
something and I boys just don't really
like take no for an answer
so maybe just like say Oh take my number
come back with me and you're like no no
no sorry I'm just like with my friends
it's like Millie there if you're not
interested so that happens all the time
especially in London but probably the
most invasive moment that I had was when
I went to Newcastle two years ago for my
birthday and we were all in a club
together and my friends had kind of gone
a little bit ahead than me so I was just
kind of like training behind I was not
that this is an excuse to behave like
this at all I'm just gonna but paint the
picture I was wearing like a really
low-cut dress that obviously like I'd
have to stick my boobs - Irish mind the
picture so I'm going to show you okay
this isn't from the night but that's me
wearing the dress so you could kind of
see the thing I'm talking about
anyway so I'm just like shuttling along
behind them and I'm walking up the
stairs and a club that we were at and
kind of halfway up the stairs there's a
table that you can all see but rent out
wherever and it was literally filled
with boys so I'm like walking up the
stairs and they're all pouring their
vodka or whatever and I'm like walking
with like my car and they like come on
to me and they're like made like do you
want some and stuff it's coming straight
from the bottle so I know that it's safe
and they're not like handing me a drink
they've pre poured otherwise it would
never have taken it but I was just like
your house sure like whatever you can
like top up my cup whatever and then
they're pouring it in
cup and then he moves it to my chest
so he's pouring straight vodka all over
my chest think fuck that was all that it
was because I'm wearing a white dress
so who bought because obviously not
sticky and it's not gonna stain it's
just gonna dry and we'll be fine but I'm
tired as well dude I mean like he just
poured that all over me and I'm like ah
ha ha
like thanks I'm already kind of going to
the bathroom the bathroom is upstairs so
I just thought oh my god I'm just gonna
go under the hair dryer and we'll just
move past it but as he's pouring it on
my chest him and his friends then kind
of come at my chest to almost like lick
it off and that is when I was like get
off me like I don't know you that's
really yeah really fucking invasive but
then I just think I must have been kind
of tipsy the time so I was like hey
off you go bye bye I'm gonna end on a
question for my friend that goes when
was the last time you bought well Lucy
I'm about to see you in five minutes
so probably tell you then two days of it
anyway so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this Q&amp;amp;A and give it a thumbs up if you
want more invasive and personal kind of
questions or type videos I love these
kind of ones cuz I sit here and I'm
laughing and thinking oh my god I wonder
who's gonna watch this that knows me and
it's gonna be like when I next season be
like but anyway if you like this video

answer your question it probably just
wasn't passing they're nuts so take that
