today I asked you guys on Twitter what
videos you kind of wanted to see and a
lot of you guys said like must-have
products that type of thing so I thought
maybe I might do a series or something
but I'm going to start off with my
must-haves utterly palettes so I have
created ten brands I have kind of like
more palettes but it's kind of more
brands and then we'll pick my favorite
palette from them so just start off with
the kind of more affordable side of the
palette spectrum some of my favorite
palettes from like the drugstore and
stuff like that these ones from L'Oreal
Paris they're kind of like the perfect
size to kind of just chuck in your
makeup bag and I have the colors so I
have two of the nude ones one in Rose
and when beige and the other one in
smokey so they kind of have um have a
palette for kind of every person if you
like more cool tones or more warmer
tones I personally prefer the beige one
the best just because you guys know I
like those kind of warmer tones so it
looks like there so most of the palettes
are the same innocence they contain a
like variety of matte shades and
shimmery shades so perfect for like all
of the ghost smokey eyes did that make
sense and they're a really good dupe for
like the naked palettes if you don't
have them and you want something a bit
more affordable these are really good
and the pigmentation is I mean if you
haven't tried them already defo pick up
one of the L'Oreal color riche like
either nude rose anomic beige rose or
smoky palette speaking of the naked
palettes they are definitely a must-have
for me i / naked one and the naked 3 I
don't own the naked smoky or the naked -
I don't know why I don't know the naked
- because as you guys probably know
those colors are like right up my street
but the naked smoke is a bit too cool
tone for me but you can see the naked
one if I have to pick one of them
definitely the naked one it's definitely
my most loved to add more and it's
definitely the most warm tone and I
think just with most things the original
is always the best I've literally
pan on the half-baked shade it's like my
favorite go to gold shade I really don't
use it enough I always forget that I
have this palette so let me know if you
want to if you have this palette to
anyone Seymour looks lit that yet the
naked of the Urban Decay eyeshadows in
general are like amazing I am too of the
like glittery ones as well and I'm in
love with them there's such such such
good quality and they're like a perfect
gift as well so the naked palettes even
I only own two and there's four I
definitely a must-have I shadow palette
if you haven't tried them already moving
on I am in love with the Sigma eyeshadow
palettes as well if you've you can get
these on like love makeup I think and I
want to say that cocktail cosmetics if
you're from the UK or Amazon maybe box
you can get them from the signal website
as you guys know a job at this company
so leave it down below but yeah the
Sigma eyeshadow palettes are such a good
size
they contain at 12 I shows and they're
all like a really decent size like I
said they are super super pigmented this
one is the smokescreen one and they have
such a variety of colors and they do
like sets of them as well online if you
wanted to get like the palette and like
other things as well they're super
pigmented I love with that golden shade
there like I said a lot of these
palettes are really good for like smokey
eyes and stuff or if you just like the
more neutral tones for everyday this one
contains a brilliant gorgeous pop of
like turquoise so it kind of has colors
for everyone there's one of their other
ones that has more kind of white warmer
pink year Moby burger cheatengine I
really really really like that one as
well so if you haven't tried any of the
Sigma I shadows I have their single
shows as well just like the urban decay
and they're just as amazing definitely
worth checking them out they're such a
good size and they're really like thin
and compact and I love the fact that
there's like a giant mirror in there is
world super handy for trouble so yeah
death a must-have palette another
favorite palette for people that love
warm tones just like me is the deliverer
quickly blend palette this one I think
when it came out
when not four and it's still one of my
favorites as you can see it contains how
many to 3/10
I shall is all like a really good size
it's annoying me that it doesn't have a
mirror but the packets so thin anyway
this one's like amazing to travel with
as well these two are like the best
crease shades ever you've got like your
initial transition shade and like
something to deepen up with as well as a
really dark shape there and loads of
different colors for a shimmer you've
got like pinks Browns a bit of purple of
a sea of gold and a really nice
highlighting color so it kind of is the
perfect palette for someone that loves
and warmer tones and maybe a bit more of
a natural look really good present as
well I recently got this to my friend
for her birthday and she really liked it
Oh via the pigmentation of these is so
amazing these are like so even just
general as a brand their pigments are
incredible they're some of my favorite
pigments as well but definitely this
palette they did so many of these kind
of like palettes of 10 shadows this
one's definitely my favorite and I think
there's a lot other people's favorites
as well but there's a lot more like a
cool tone nude one smoky one bit more of
a colorful one so if you haven't checked
out the Zoe the autumn palettes you
definitely should they are like I'm
saying for all of these and as obviously
because it's in this video I must have
palette more like a recent discovery for
me I when I went to America got the
lorac unzipped palette I debated between
all of their palettes and which one to
get because there's like the lorac pro
one - there's that big one and they have
another one like this that's a bit more
golden but this one just kind of called
out to me it's it's honestly one of my
favorites I do look with it and everyone
like really really really liked seeing
eyeshadow quality and stuff like that
these are so pigmented and if you it's
like the perfect what even though it's
just been like Valentine's Day palette
it has such gorgeous like pink tones
this is definitely more than movi
burgundy kind of colored palette so
maybe for people with more like green
eyes this would look absolutely stunning
on I'm in love with the pigmentation of
these that unbrided color and unspoken I
like their to matches that they are
amazing I
definitely want to do a like Matt's I
look with these colors because they're
so pigmented and it come to the mirror
which is super handy and it's just as
thin as there's a wave of palette as
well so it's really good for traveling
and I am in love with just like the
pigmentation let me swatch there this is
the shade undiscovered like such a
gorgeous gold color you can see I'm most
of these palettes of warm tones but I am
telling you guys that they do you like
Coolidge anyone's and stuff if you're
from the UK you can get lorac I think on
some like beauty outlets and Amazon I
think you can get them on but if you
haven't tried this one or any of the
lorac palettes this one was definitely
my favorite but you should definitely
try them out I'm getting it moving
on Anastasia Beverly Hills that has
definitely got some of the best
eyeshadows in the palette and like
eyeshadow game it's very annoying
because when she comes out with palettes
and they don't they literally sell out
so it's like literally instantly and
some of them are like limited edition
I'm not sure if this one was or this one
was these two are my favorite out the
ones that I've got it is the self-made
palette and the world traveler palette
especially because they both contain so
this one is the world traveler palette
if I do a kind of close up of the colors
you can see you've got like your warm
tones this is like my favorite color
it's in both of the palettes it's pink
champagne and it is a beaut the air you
can see you've got like your warm tones
your highlighting color some pops of
color for people that are a bit more
adventurous I love this one and you can
still get your hands on it defo get your
hands on it this one's my favorite one
of all the ones that she's come up with
I know her and makeup by Maya coming
the palette and I can tell that one's
probably gonna take over my life and I'm
gonna love it so if you haven't tried
Anastasia bubbles eyeshadows you should
if you can get your hands on the palette
it's a lot more easy opportunity to try
out all the colors but she obviously
does sell individual eyeshadow pan but
you can custom make your own palettes so
you should definitely try them out
there's some really at nice colors in
there I know this isn't a palette that
you can buy but obviously they sell the
Z palettes on their website future cuts
to make your own one it is makeup geek
this is my not like every day I shall
iPad app it is colors the eyebrow where
regularly you can see it is like the
warm tone like heaven I've got mix of
shimmer and mattes in there if you
haven't tried makeup geek eyeshadows you
definitely definitely should a lot of
you guys requests for me to do a
must-have makeup geek eyeshadow kind of
collection so I'll definitely do that
you know it's mostly these ones here
some of my favorites are Peach Smoothie
beach sand cream some of the foiled
eyeshadows I am in love with makeup geek
eyeshadows they are some of the most
pigmented eyeshadows I've ever used and
they are so cheap you can get them on
beautybay now if you're from the UK so
you haven't tried them yet definitely
maybe start with like a like the 9
pallets you can make and get like 4 or
like or 9 or whatever and just try them
out they are so affordable and such
incredible quality you'll be addicted
like me and have like everyone in the
collection yeah so this is kind of like
my custom palette but so it's kind of
like a must-have I shadow more than like
an art I shadow palette but you should
definitely custom make your own one with
colors that you love maybe get some more
adventurous colors as well they've got
literally every color Under the Sun
eyeshadow on their website so definitely
recommend makeup geek before makeup geek
I my number one eye shadows were Mac
eyeshadows this is the this is their
neutral palette so they do sell these
palettes and the inserts and for you to
fill them up individually these are like
this is like a premade one obviously I
went for more of the warm neutrals they
did a cool neutral one as well but I
also have my
that I've made myself so I've just kind
of bought the palette not the insert so
I could fit more eyeshadows in and it's
kind of just like everyday crease colors
that I wearing here Mac eyeshadows um
even though so many more brands are
coming out with shadows Mac I still feel
always been number one they are such
they have such a range of colors so easy
to blend texture is definitely my number
one favorite put under the eye
especially it really brings out the
color because it's like it's this one
whether it's the one I put pound on it
really brings out the color in your eye
there are only ten pounds and eye shadow
which or seems a bit more expensive than
makeup geek and you most people would
probably argue that make it Peaks a lot
more pigmented they are one that they
last the longest time and you can get
two parents for palettes or the Sigma 50
into you've not tried Mac eyeshadows by
picking up a couple one just trying them
out because they're just as amazing and
a lot more accessible for like people
everywhere because Mac is such a like
worldwide global brand
so Mac eyeshadow palettes slightly more
even expensive product are the Tom Ford
eyes shadow palettes the two that I own
are golden mink and Cognex a bomb this
one is the golden Mik one I kind of live
for the two shimmery shades I'm more
prefer the Tom Ford like shimmer shades
for the lid in these palettes but they
just called to me I've got this one on
my eyes today I've got this one in my
crease as well it's like a nice matte
Brown this one's definitely my fave out
the two like I said again this shimmery
shade here is a life it's like a
shimmery bronze color and it is gorgeous
on people only you've got like any kind
of eye especially blue it really brings
out the color I know they are slightly
more expensive but they are worth it the
pigmentation is absolutely stunning and
the glitter it's like not too much it's
at the perfect shimmer they're really
nice size I like hand back and travel
with the mirror as well so if you can
Tom Ford eyes shadow quads are amazing
and I know that they do loads of colors
like cool tones like a really smoky one
and that sort of stuff so definitely
worth looking at the Tom Ford eyeshadow
palettes the last but not least I think
this is everyone sort of number one
palette and over the last year has
literally taken over
like the eyeshadow pallete game the
morphe palette obviously at my number
one is the 3/5 oh if you guys didn't
know every time it goes and stock it
literally sells out instantly but if you
guys have it it's like the most
phenomenal palette ever you get so so so
many eyeshadows for such an affordable
price if you're a warm term lover
obviously this palette like speaks to
you in the Y note speaks to me and it's
literally me in a palette I'm in love
with like every single color and I've
never really liked that with a palette
like if I loved every color that's quite
like a rare thing but I honestly I've
done my brush in literally like every
single one every time I'm doing like a
smoky eye or something it's amazing I
know it's quite hard to get hold of and
recently I purchased the 35k palette so
this one's a bit more of a cool toned
one with these ones but it's got loads
of warm tone down here and I'll
essentially another that I've never I've
not really had people talk about it so I
got mine from a Beauty Bay but the
pigmentation of more the eyeshadow brush
and shadows are so incredible and when
you buy them individually they're so
cheap and you can custom make your own
ones on their website as well I think
you guys knew that morphe palettes would
be like my number one even though those
aren't really in an order I was saving
this one too laughs because I could go
on and on a lot more people it's and how
amazing they are they are like a really
good size as well they're super
lightweight for trouble and a really
nice gift as well cuz I think more
people coming such an incredible brand a
lot more accessible for us people here
in the UK I think the brand the
pigmentation of the shadows and the
price just makes more feel like my
number one I shouldn't must-have
palettes so if you can definitely get
your hands on one of them they have
literally every single palette Under the
Sun you can think of crazy colors
neutral colors cool colors warm colors
everything so there's definitely a
palette out there for everyone and that
is it they are my must-haves kind of
brands for eyeshadow palettes or like my
eyeshadow palettes in general I really
hope you guys liked this video give it a
thumbs up if you did and let me know you
want to see another must-haves video and
if so what of in the comments
below sorry I didn't get a video up

schedule next week just been super busy
