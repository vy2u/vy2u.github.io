is the first video of 2018 it's a lot
better way to start the new year with an
updated everyday makeup routine for 2018
this is mainly a task in focus video
there is no eyeshadow involved for me
every day I can just really quickly do a
decent looking skin work on a pair of
lashes or just mascara if you're more
comfortable doing that and a lip gloss

just gonna give a little bit of an
update for the new year I've planned so
much content for you guys I can't wait
we are going to be doing a bunch of
different kinds of videos I'm going to
be doing a series of testing makeup in
the upcoming weeks of work as well of
just a single brand so you guys know was
good from some of the favorite brands
that you've always wanted to try so you
can kick start the new year with some
fresh makeup ideas maybe I don't know
gonna be posting a lot more content on
my Instagram and snapchat too so make
sure you are following me there I'm also
super active on Twitter so again if
you're new make sure you following me on
my socials because once you're doing
come and join the fun but yes so this is
my everyday updated makeup routine for
the new year without further ado let's
get started
okay let's get crack-a-lackin' baby
Oh sick me just have a skin appreciation
I found little and scram tutorial how to
get this glowing skin so it'll be up if
you're watching this on the Wednesday
will be up tomorrow so keep my Instagram
for what I've used on my skin but I'm
just gonna be uh prying my skin using
the Hooda complexion perfection primer
this is such a good primer it literally
makes your makeup last all day and even
if it is just like a lightweight
everyday makeup look you don't want your
makeup to be slipping and sliding around
throughout the day whatever you're doing
especially if this is gonna be like your
quick makeup routines when you're like
flying around which is kind of what it
is for me I don't want to fall off my
face and this primer is amazing for
keeping it on also it feels super
moisturizing on the skin I use this in
like a lot all the videos it's such a go
to prom with me I know it's gonna work
my way okay moving on to foundation I've
been reaching for these so much recently
and I don't think I've use them in a
video yet and loads of you are asking me
about them it is the collection
perfection weight collection lasting
perfection 16 hour wear foundation I mix
these two colors together I mix the
shade cool vanilla number six and cool
caramel number seven just because the
cool caramel gives me a little bit of
that warmer undertone that I have going
on on my tan but core vanilla is more
like my natural color so I like to mix
these together they are kind of like a
full varying medium to full coverage of
foundation so depending how much of it
you use it can be more like a medium one
especially if you've got a lot of
skincare on like I do at the moment it
will definitely it share it out so
perfect for everyday but you can also
build up to a full coverage if you love
that full glam look every day which I
also love so I'm just gonna be stippling
it on to the face with a Beauty Blender
a Beauty Blender is also one a really
fast tool if like this is gonna be like
a quick everyday routine for you but it
also is fast and shares out the product
which is a really really nice because
like I said this is medium it's a full
coverage but obviously mix it with a
moisturizer it will get that long wear
but also share out too I find the
coverage of this to be kind of light
semi matte I feel like it
he has a satin ish finish to it but then
that might be because I always wear a
lot of moisturizing skincare underneath
which might alter the actual finish of
it now I love the coverage of this they
extended their shade range as well and
it's from collection so it's super
affordable to me that a lot of my
everyday products are from the drugstore
but I feel that's because you always
like like to save your higher-end
products for a more worthy occasion than
just going to the shops
okay cedar I'm using an oldie but
goodie is the maybelline instant age
rewind under-eye concealer I always see
it like that people complain about the
like sponge applicator of it but I
actually really really like it has a
really great coverage and it's really
really good for getting rid of those and
I bags which is exactly what we need
first thing in the morning for our
makeup and I'm gonna be using it in the
color light so go ahead on my face
unless we're just using my Beauty
Blender to blend that wall out again
honesty love this concealer I always
forget how much I love it until I think
oh I haven't used that in a while and
then I go towards it I'm hoping in 2018
they come out with like a bigger shade
range if this concealer because I feel
like it's really quite small when I went
to America they had such a more
extensive color range so I'm hoping
that's to come for us so if you're more
like a lighter complexion or a deeper
complexion and you've always wanted to
try this concealer I'm feeling 20:18
will of be the year okay so that's all
the cream products that we're gonna be
using on the face because anybody got
time to cream contour on like an
everyday basis so I'm now gonna go ahead
and set everything in pace with powder
and this is the beauty bakery
translucent powder
now I was saying to you guys on Twitter
and if you don't follow me on Twitter
what you doin do it now pause video and
do it now because I'm so active on
Twitter it's like the easiest way to
kind of contact you guys instantly I'm
saying that I want to do a series of
videos one every day for a week of
testing brands of makeup and so many of
you said Beauty bakery and I would so
love to do that it's a brand that I feel
like this 2018 is gonna be their year
100% their powder is insane you guys
know I'm obsessed with they're like a
loose powder highlighter this brush
the bronzy ones and lip products are
supposedly amazing as well but that's
kind of all they do finale do eyeshadow
lip products powder and highlighter and
that's I feel like that's not really
testing like a full face of makeup so I
might wait later on and upcoming months
to see if they come out with anything
new so I'm able to do kind of more of a
full face if that makes sense
because I don't think they do any like
skin products or anything like that so
we'll hold tight and see because I
definitely would love to do that for
that brand and test them out for you
guys cuz yet they have so much hype and
speculation around them I think it would
be really good to test I'm now gonna go
ahead and bronze up my skin it using my
trusty hoola bronzer this kind of works
as like a bronzer and contour all-in-one
so it saves me having to use two
different products because I do love to
contour and edgy enough to bronze for me
there are two totally different steps
but this is kind of like my quick and
easy all-in-one product to do both those
things if you're of a lighter paler
complexion than me they did come out
with a hoola light this last gym oh my
goodness but see this year last year
which could be a perfect few guys if
you've always kind of thought maybe who
knows a little bit too dark for you or
if you're more of like a darker warmer
complexion than the Dallas I think it's
actually more of like a blush a shade
but it works really well as like a
warmer tone it deeper bronzer would work
for people with a slightly more kind of
warmer and more tanned complexion than
me for my everyday makeup I am so just
kind of more skin focused and as I said
at the beginning of the video I'm not
gonna be using any eyeshadow I just feel
fairly comfortable to wear a big pair of
like lashes so it's definitely more of
like a skin focus video you can't go
wrong with a little bit of blusher and
I'm gonna be using my Milani baked blush
in berry and more think I use this in my
previous video as well I love the
formula of these they give such a
gorgeous glow they're not too too
pigmented so you're not left looking at
like you've been slapped in the face I
cook less hands and this one has a
gorgeous gold like reflex running
through it which I really really
appreciate it gives such a like gorgeous
natural flush
the skin so that's kind of the main base
of the skin done but before highlighter
I am gonna go ahead and do my brows and
for that I am gonna use the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow Wiz in medium brown
and set them in place with the Loreal
brow artist plumper in light/medium just
because I've kind of got like lighter
bits running through my head but my the
base of my hair is naturally quite dark
so I like to kind of mix it together
with these two products I literally just
did my updated brow routine so I'll add
a card to that there so you guys can go
and watch that because I'm just gonna
quickly go ahead and skip through this
part and then we can move back onto the
skin and nearly finish the eyes and it's
basically the quickest makeup routine
you've ever seen in your life okay brows
are done dangerous brows just make such
difference a sweater now it's time to
highlight the skin and I'm gonna be
taking an old favor again this is the
Oprah nikkietutorials Club in glory
goals even though it's just a quick
everyday a makeup routine don't let you
blow go like I said I always like to
focus on the skin sorry I just choked on
my own highlight we're just gonna douse
ourselves and this gorgeous product I
see I thought I give your skin is on
point then I feel really confident to
like go throughout the day I feel like
skin is just so important I could just
keep applying this oh dang
make sure to get the Cupid's bow pop in
and our nose poppin yes skin mm-hmm
okay now we're just gonna set the skin
in place you're using it the a glam glow
glow set a makeup setting spray well if
I actually spread it on my face that
would work that stuff smells so good so
you obviously want to make sure that
your skin is completely set all day but
now there's only a couple of stages left
we're just gonna apply mascara lashes
and a lip product super mascara cuz to
be fair you could just stop at mascara
but my lashes are a little bit small so
I feel comfortable wearing lashes on an
everyday basis of see if you don't get
yourself a good mascara and this mascara
is from maybe as the
sensational one I was watching Jolin
Lipscomb's like best of 2017 video and
she mentioned this and I knew it was in
my collection so I thought I'm gonna
give it another go and yeah I can tell
I'm gonna be reaching for this a lot
more this year I'm excited to see the
numerous cars that I can I know that
maybe they're coming out with I've seen
it on like the American Instagram and I
love this one cuz it's got a cooker
thick brush and the bristles on it I
like really hard to say really it comb
through your lashes really separate them
and lengthen them you see it just gives
like a really gorgeous natural fluttery
lash now I actually only apply mascara
to my top eyelashes on like a day to day
basis just because I feel like it just
creates more looking elongated look on
my eye it just makes them appear a
little bit more open I don't know why I
just I know sometimes I feel like if I
apply it on my bottom lashes as well
after I've applied my false lashes it's
kind of like a little bit too much I've
not got like corresponding I makeup to
you know go with it so I just kind of
apply it on just on like my top lashes
only but before we apply our false
eyelashes I do just like to highlight my
inner corner of my eye and I'm just
gonna take the highlighted that I used
on my face so the glow girls Nicki
tutorial highlighter just to kind of
brighten up my inner corners like so and
then for lashes today I'm going to be
taking another pair of the morphe
premium lashes and these are in the
style smoochy they are super fluttery
they're not very like what's the word
they're not like super clustered or
close together so they're a really nice
natural fluttery eyelash they give the
appearance of lash extensions which is
something I actually think I want to try
this year I've never had lash extensions
before and I yeah I really want to try
them because every lash that I purchase
or like I wear I'm always after that
lash extension effect like something
like natural fluttery very flirty and
wispy and that's always what I look for
in false eyelashes so like why haven't I
tried
just actually getting the lash
extensions I don't know but while these
lashes are dry I'm just gonna apply a
lip product and I'm just gonna be using
the one today this is the two-faced
sweet peach creamy peach oil lip gloss
in the color pick buzz I love this
they're super nourishing on the lips
smell insane it's like such a gorgeous
perfect everyday nude color honestly I
could eat a tube of this and not even
kidding I personally prefer a paler nude
for everyday they do a really gorgeous
nude color range of these so if you have
heard something darker definitely have a
browse these they literally glide onto
the lips and I feel like them I remember
they go on effortlessly over like the
liquid lipsticks if you find that your
lips get dry really easily these are
really nourishing lip gloss
cuz it's lewin tell you guys and I live
ah suffering just gonna go ahead and pop
the lashes on we're just gonna be out
here waiting for the glue to dry but
this is pretty much the finished makeup
look so this is the finished makeup look
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video super quick well I found it super
quick I feel I can use quite a minimal
amount of product for me and we still
kind of looked effortlessly put together
this is like my go-to makeup look for
2018 just skin focused lashes and a
little bit of a nude lip gloss I really
