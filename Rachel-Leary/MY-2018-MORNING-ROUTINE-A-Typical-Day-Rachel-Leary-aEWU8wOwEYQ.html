morning guys and welcome to my morning
routine
good morning everyone and as you guys
know already this is my morning routine
video it's currently like 9:00 a.m. 839
a and I just woken up hence looking so
gorgeous but we're gonna start the
morning we're gonna have some coffee and
possibly a smoothie whenever I wake up I
crave different I know actually that it
depends how hungry I am or what I'm
doing but I'm gonna be going to the gym
soon so I normally just like to have a
cup of coffee and a smoothie it's gonna
go ahead and do that now but actually
what another thing I like to do a first
is make my bed I don't know if anybody
else does but when I make my bed it kind
of one assures me that I probably won't
get back into it because then I can be
more productive and two I just kind of
feel more set for the day so I
definitely like to make my bed before I
do anything else
so this is what my bed looks like when
it's made I feel like I've told people
where these are from before those those
posters are from casino and these
cushion covers are all are from Alison's
gonna have to do with this um we're
gonna have to deal with this too so as
you guys know I do live on my own in my
own flat and one of the downsides about
living on your own in a flat in the
morning is you kind of walk into the
kitchen and I'm kind of faced with
everything that I couldn't be bothered
to do the night before so that tends to
be the boring stuff like the dishwasher
and just general cleaning so normally I
have all intentions of coming to the
kitchen and making coffee and stuff but
I'd rather just get the annoying stuff
out the way so that's what I'm gonna do
okay now the cleaning is done I can
officially it stop making myself
something into a drink
now sometimes if I'm super tired and
getting up super early I'll have an
espresso but a lot of the time I love
these skinny latte sachets there from
Nescafe skinny lattes actually only
really have about like 17 calories in
them and I definitely prefer them to
mainstream at regular coffee so I'm
gonna have one of these this morning but
also this morning I'm gonna be making
myself a little smoothie before I go to
the gym just kind of help fill me up a
little bit as well so in my smoothie I
like to put frozen fruits out to put
strawberries or frozen blueberries a
fresh banana and I've been loving using
oat milk as well as some oats and the
tiniest bit of peanut butter as well
this is kind of like my breakfast
morning smoothie because this all gives
me a lot of energy before I go to the
gym like slow releasing energy so let's
go ahead and
and now it's just time to blend
voila really good fun fact - I always
like to leave my spoons in my hot drinks
cuz it helps it cool down a little bit
quicker and then I can drink it quicker
- now I know I said that I make my bed
in hopes that I don't get back into it I
realized I've woken up and I haven't
checked my social medias what the
and that's definitely one of the first
things that I do do so perhaps maybe
I'll hop back into bed just for a little
while with my drinks and do that it's
now 9:30 so I'll probably give myself
kinda like 20 or so minutes to do this
and then it's time to go to the gym so
that's why I kind of have that as my
background so it doesn't really let me
sleep in so much so I'm motivated to get
up and go to the gym
so I don't know about anyone else but
the first app that I go and I think is
Instagram and I so much prefer looking
it through at people's Instagram stories
than I do snapchat at the moment I don't
know what it is I just kind of like
prefer them you know so I love it to go
ahead and watch everyone's like
Instagram stories and see what they're
doing then usually I like to go on
Twitter
twitter is like one of my favorite apps
- I love like I feel like my Twitter
feed is just so funny and witty all of
the time and I love reading people's
like funny tweets so I just like to have
a good scroll through here then usually
I'll probably check snapchat and see
what kind of like all my friends have
been up to especially his last night was
a Saturday night and I didn't go out so
I'll see if there was anything that I
missed and then finally I'll probably go
on what's up and respond to a bunch of
stuff that I probably it was asleep and
missed so I'm just gonna be sitting here
drinking my drink having a little let's
scroll it through a social media I also
will probably check my emails as well
but I didn't kind of want to show that
on the screen in case there was anything
a private and confidential like I said
just gonna drink my drinks have a little
scroll and then it's off to the gym
which I actually I'm gonna take you
along with me and film kind of as much
as I can without kind of being cool or
feeling embarrassed so I'm going to
bring you along to that but first I will
show you the makeup that I wear to the
gym because I do I some but it might
help some of you guys out that maybe one
to our makeup to the gym but don't know
what makeup to wear to the gym because
all the makeup that I do at the gym is
kind of like okay to oxygen if that
makes sense
I'll show you okay so we're here at my
makeup - but like I said I do like to
wear a little bit of makeup to the gym
so I thought I would just show you what
it is in case you guys like me and you
don't want to go completely bare but
then obviously you don't want to wear a
full-face this is actually made for its
like sporting makeup it's by a brand
called sport vex it is there cool down
primer and recovery gel so I put this on
my skin at first and it had leaves are
like a cooling tingling a sensation to
your skin and I think it's to help
prevent redness so obviously when you're
working out and stuff it kind of helps
reduce you with the appearance of
looking red then at the foundation I
were matte face and body foundation this
is so so so sheer I can't remember the
exact percentages but I'm
sure this foundation is like 60% water
is super super hydrating on the skin
it's really really really really
lightweight but it adds just like a tiny
bit of color so it's perfect for the gym
and I actually think its water resistant
or sweat resistant it's something like
that so again I find this super
comfortable to wear to the gym and then
I take my Anastasia Beverly Hills at
brower's in medium brown and like really
roughly fill in my eyebrows as they do
need a little bit of work and then
finally I literally just put on a light
coat on my top lashes only just of a
random mascara okay so this is literally
my gym face like I said super minimal
but sometimes I just need a little
something so I don't know completely
like I just woke up and out of bed so
now we are off to the gym thought I
would just show you what I'm wearing so
you don't think that I'm this like
totally professional gym go cuz I
literally just wear like a baggy t-shirt
some leggings sports bra all that stuff
so it's time to put it on so just a
little heads up I actually wear men's
deodorant I just thought I just feel
like it is so much more effective
actually smells and really really good
and lasts a long time so if you go to
the gym a lot or you just sweat a lot
then and you're a girl
try men's deodorant because I actually
hate the smell of women's deodorant -
here's the gym attire nothing special
but these leggings are like so
comfortable by the way we're trying to
grow a butt in 2018 yeah this is
literally me off to the gym so let's now
actually and go to the gym
really I'm hot I hope you guys I
appreciated some of the clips that I
inserted of just what I do in the gym I
am at weekly vlogging next week so I'm
sure you'll see a lot more it was
actually fun filming some bits and
obviously with my friend Lucy and stuff
so I hope you guys appreciate that but
now I'm gonna go home and shower but I
thought it'd be fun to show you some of
my favorite like I like things that are
used in the shower in terms of like what
I used to wash with and all that kind of
stuff in case you guys I don't know are
interested but yeah so she's gonna drive
her now shower and then it's literally
like half-past twelve so it's
technically not even a morning anymore
it's the afternoon so I've kind of like
failed this video already but I'll show
you the last minute bit and maybe my
morning skincare routine and yeah so
let's get cracking these are my favorite
things to use in the shower I love the
shower gel it's literally smells like
strawberries so I like anything on my
body that smells really really sweet
there's like Sun since I like for
certain parts of my body I like my body
just not really sweet I usually like my
hair to smell kind of like coconutty but
we're not washing our hair today
yeah so I love this on my body and also
my sister got me into this this is from
lush it is their Snow Fairy body
conditioner you kind of apply it to your
body while it's damp like in the shower
rub it in and then wash it off and
you're literally left feeling baby but
smooth I am obsessed with this so that's
kind of the like shower cleaning routine
that I do when I'm just washing my body
and not my hair and then afterwards I'm
gonna show you my morning skincare
routine okay we're now all fresh out the
shower so like I said I'm just gonna
show you my good morning skincare
routine so first of all I like to kind
of cleanse my skin of any dirts that
like I might have picked up while I was
asleep or like just followed with Jim
and I love I used the it Nippon fab ones
too but these ones are just here's the
Nippon flat ones are in the other room
for when I use them the other day this
is the glow tonic to go exfoliating
toner pads like I said these are really
good at just getting rid of any like
dead skin cells any left over makeup
really just kind of helping you deep
clean your skin to start the day with
like a fresh base I normally use kind of
one either side and I always kind of
like to focus it around
rose area because there the cut that's
come out the area that gets kind of
clogged up the most you can see just
kind of like a little bit of makeup left
that we've got off so I don't actually
really use a moisturizer in the morning
and that's because normally I film in
the morning and that normally involves
applying makeup and that's what I like
to apply my moisturizer but I still like
to have like a skincare routine before
applying my moisturizer so I've been
really loving is the origins ginseng
energy of boosting this this is so a
great in the morning it smells really
refreshing it's what I can really like
citrusy scent and it's just like a light
oh no it just hydrates your skin without
the real deep power of a moisturizer and
just leaves me feeling really refreshed
honestly it smells like a fruit salad on
your face then what I like to do is just
apply the kind of corresponding eye
cream this is the gin again from origins
the jin-sang eye cream to brighten and
deeper which is exactly what we need
first thing in the morning and I'm just
gonna dab underneath my eye and again
going with like a patting motion because
this kind of gets the collagen and I
know your blood pumping into the surface
underneath your eyes to make them look a
lot less tight so if you've been
applying your eye cream or kind of going
like back and forth try like just go
like tapping it into your skin and
seeing if that makes more of a
difference in terms of making you look
more awake and helping get rid of the
appearance of under-eye bags
and finally the final step is the Mable
and Meg lumi elixir and this is
basically how highly highly erotic acid
and vitamin C serum now this is again
really good at just kind of helping
reduce the appearance of like wrinkles
and like in the college and active in
your skin how tighten up your skin and
again I'm just gonna like slap it across
my face but it doesn't really leave an
oily residue it really is just like a
lightweight serum which is again perfect
for the morning because I like to apply
a lot makeup kind of afterwards so I
don't want any kind of oils or anything
like that to kind of ruin the makeup and
be sitting on my skin for ages I
normally like to apply oils unless they
specifically don't designed to go under
make up late at night and then that way
I've got like eight hours or whatever
how many hours for them to just like
absorb and my skin to feel bruni like
refreshed in the morning so I am a
feeling super super fresh now and now
this would be the time that I'm just
gonna quickly make myself some lunch or
I would get to filming a new video or
whatever I have going on at for the day
obviously today is Sunday and not every
day is a jam-packed day filled with
events and all that kind of stuff and
I'd normally get like a lot of post but
obviously as it's a Sunday I haven't
today so I'm just gonna go ahead and get
cracking editing this video I normally
have a video or something to edit or
like film video and then edit something
like that so yeah I just thought this
would give you an insight into what my
mornings normally consist of the kind of
things I get up to on a day to day a
basis like I said I'm gonna make myself
some lunch but I'm not gonna include
that in this video because like I said I
am weekly vlogging for the next couple
of weeks and I'm sure I'll be including
what I eat in there if you enjoyed this
video definitely make sure to give it a
thumbs up and let me know what you love
to do in the morning and give me a
thumbs up in general if you like these
routine videos because then I'm
definitely gonna do like an evening
routine or anything else so just let me
know in the comments down below what you
think thank you guys so much for
watching sorry it wasn't like super
exciting but this is the real life so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
