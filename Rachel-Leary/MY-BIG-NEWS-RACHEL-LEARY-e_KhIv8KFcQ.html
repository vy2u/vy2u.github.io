see by the title in fact I've been kind
of teasing it all week to you guys I'm

this is so so so exciting literally I've
always wanted to do this I thought long
and hard about the kind of design that I
wanted it to be and I kind of looked at
other people's match and I was thinking
like I want to create something
obviously that's me personal to me but
something that even if you don't know
who I am you can still wear it you know
like I don't want my name to be
completely plastered all over it I
wanted it to be wearable merch that like
anyone can wear that I know you guys
will love that I obviously it love and
that it's personal to me so I really
really hope you guys love it as much as
I do I just wanted to take the time to
say like this isn't possible without you
guys I did she love you guys so much and
I wanted to kind of give you something
back you know like I wanted to make
something or just like create something
that we can like both have in common you
know I mean like just something that
brings us together you know and if you
remember like a few weeks ago has asked
you guys what kind of things do you
think of when you think of me I am so so
so happy that you guys said nude lips
and like all that kind of stuff because
that's literally the idea that I went
with and that I kind of always knew that
I wanted to go with so in this video I'm
going to show you everything that I am
coming out with this is just kind of
like the first batch of stuff if it goes
well and that you guys love it feel free
to give me as much feedback as you want
in terms of what products you'd like to

like to see her on or like you want me
to change anything
all that kind of stuff like let me know
because I want to like keep this going
and I want to bring out new stuff for
you guys but I really hope you guys like
the kind of first batch of stuff that I
have chosen and design for you guys so
first things first let me tell you when
the launch date is the launch is on the
31st of October at 5 p.m. so Halloween 5
p.m. which is Tuesday so two days from
now I will have left the link to the
website that you can shop it on down
below as the countdown has already begun
I announce this like a couple of days
ago so you guys have been able to get a
vibe of the kind of print and design
that we're going with on some of the
products so I feel like without further
I'm just gonna go through all the
products I'm gonna go through the sizes
the prices and all that kind of stuff
and all the information that you're
gonna need in this video ready for
Tuesday it's also in front of me I'm
wearing one right now
I can't wait okay so first of all let me
talk about what I am wearing right now
this is like a crewneck sweater of
everything I am gonna insert a picture
of it here because I haven't I can't
like put everything on so I'll show you
what it looks like here but it will hold
everything up so this is just like your
classic crewneck sweater as the white
body and black sleeves I thought I
really kind of liked this design I
didn't want to just go with like a plain
sweater I'd rather goes like a plain
pity and I wanted the sweatshirt to look
like kind of cool so this is the design
that kind of runs throughout everything
it has loads of little are l's on it and
my font that is on my youtube banner and
what you guys don't know is this is a
really custom design because those are
my lips I literally ascend the company
that I'm working with a picture of my
lips and they carton eyes them and
there's like a glittery outline I don't
if the cameras like picking that up yeah
they're literally at my lips on all of
the products that I'm going to show you
that have the lips on so like they're my
lips which is really cool and also the
only thing that set it does say my name
on the sleeve but I kind of just wanted
to keep it kind discreet I'd obviously
no one's gonna want to wear like a big
jumper that says Rachael Larry on it if
you're not mean cuz I don't know in my
head I just thought I want it to be
super super wearable that that like
anyone can wear you know so it just kind
of has like my initials in the lips with
the white glittery outline black sleeves
and my name on the sleeve now the price
of this sweater is 22 pounds and the
size is run from extra small to extra
extra large and they're super super
comfortable I can't tell you how amazing
this quality feels it's so nice and
snuggly a perfect for the upcoming
months literally like I don't mind this
non-stop the next thing I'm going to
show you is just a plain white t-shirt
again with the same design on it still
has the ability outline I have been
wearing this to bed as well if they are
so comfortable I can't explain it but
yeah just a plain white t-shirt I
thought like white just goes with
everything like tuck it into some mom
jeans with a bed
got like the cute lips on it this one
doesn't have my name on it anywhere just
the little are ELLs in the lips and
obviously the really cool glittery
outline again the sizes of this run from
extra small to extra extra-large and the
price of the t-shirt is 15 pounds and
the kind of final clothing item which is
I think it's like my fave is this is a
giant pink hoodie again with the same
lips design just in the corner and my
name just on the sleeve I'll insert more
of a picture here I love baby pink like
as like a bold color fennekin looks we
good on boys it looks really good on
girls and I thought this is just such a
gorgeous gorgeous color and I love the
lips against the pink too with like the
white glittery outline I'm literally
just obsessed with this one again run
some sizes extra small to extra
extra-large that's the price of this is
26 pounds and I just like I want this in
like such an oversized size and like to
snuggle in and just slip like a giant
marshmallow I feel like that's the kind
of vibe I've always go for yeah I'm so
obsessed with this one I feel like maybe
in the future come up with other colors
but for now I definitely wanted to go
with like the pink black and white vibe
because I don't know that's just kind of
like some of my favorite colors like the
peachy pinks and all that kind of stuff
so I'm so excited for you guys to get
your hands in this I feel like you guys
are gonna love this one
so the t-shirt the sweater and the
hoodie a kind of all the clothes I'm
coming out with I don't want to
overwhelm you all with like loads of
different kinds I just want to go with a
few basic ones to start with that I'm
like in love with like I love the kind
of contrasting sweater a big pink hoodie
and just a plain white tee I think there
were three things that I loved that I
wanted to kind of give to you guys first
and now I'm gonna move on to it the
accessories these are like my fave the
print the first thing that I'm gonna
show you which I'm like most excited
about is the makeup bag this is like a
black canvas makeup bag I wanted to
obviously make it black because how many
of these canvas bags have I got that are
like a white color and they just become
around within like two days because of
all the makeup that's in it so I wanted
to make it black so it stays looking a
really really cute can we just talk
about the design it says
I love a good nude and inside the nude
as loads of lipsticks and our ELLs and
again it has the white glittery outline
I actually think that this is site might
be my favorite product out of everything
besides maybe like the big pink hoodie
but I asked you guys boys something that
I say a lot and you guys literally said
I love a good noon I was like thank God
that you guys have said that because
that is why I've gone for so like I said
I feel like all the products I'm like
bringing out of really personal to me
especially with the fact that they're
like my lips and the color scheme and
things that I say I'm like obsessed with
this this just only comes in the black
and it is only eight pounds so I thought
this is a really good just like
Christmas stocking filler or a gift or
just a makeup bag in general like I
can't tell you how obsessed yeah so like
I said that one was eight pounds and now
I'm obviously coming out with bad guys
as they come in the sizes from a 5c
which is like back in the day - I put
the eight plus so which is exactly the
same size as the seven plus so yeah
ranging from basically a five up to a
eight or seven plus now I've got to kind
of color schemes going on because I
wanted to give you guys a little bit of
variety so anything that is kind of like
a black base has that lipstick design on
that was on the makeup bag so there's
loads of like nude lipsticks and are l's
in the background which is what I've got
on my phone like right now and then
anything with this like nudie a peach
background has got the lips so as you
can see it's like my lips repeated in
different shades of nude with like a
peach background and again lots of
little are else I can't tell you like
the quality of them are like so sturdy
and so thick and so good and these the
two designs available and these are
selling for 10 pounds which i think is
really good for a phone case like of
this quality can you hear them nothing's
gonna break it
and again next up I was trying to think
of products that are like relevant to
this time of year relevant to me and
that the design would look good on and
I'm thinking a mug duh I love a cup of
tea I love Allah say like the mugs
like I just love a mug in general
again it has like the two prints going
all the way around like the lips and the
lipsticks on them by the way everything
comes completely like packaged and on
the packaging is this sticker which
looks like that and it has kind of like
the website on it and all that good
stuff anyways yes we have the two mugs
in the nude and the black print and
these are selling for eight pounds and
finally the last kind of variations of
it and products I'm selling which I have
kept in their packaging so you can kind
of see ah top sockets obviously I feel
like everyone's done these but they're
actually so handy like I had one of my
phone not that long ago cuz I was like
testing them out and when it when I took
it off my phone just like didn't feel
the same but I didn't want to put it on
my case right now because I wanted to
show you the case on my phone we have
two variations of pop circuit obviously
the lips and the lipstick obviously you
they can go on top of the phone case if
you choose to buy that or just look like
cool as on your phone yeah like
like everything else it comes in the
black version and the peach version and
these are also selling for eight pounds
so that is everything that I am coming
out with to begin with in my first batch
of products I really really hope you
guys love them as much as I love you and
I also love them I tried to like I said
keep it personal to me and just like
something that I know you guys are all
gonna love and like not products I feel
like you wouldn't use like I feel like
all of them you guys be able to use on
like an everyday basis let me know in
the comments down below if you're
planning to get anything and what your
favorite items are and what I will say
is I look inside here the first 100
people to use the code yes are gonna get
a personalized to stick a pad which I
actually wrote a handwritten note that I
made them turn into a sticker for you
guys that basically says thank you so
much I love you so much
I like I've signed it and there's like a
picture of me there as well so yeah just
something fun for the first 100 people
to use that code look at one of these
too I don't know if you can tell
obviously I'm just so excited for this
launch is on Tuesday for the 31st set
your alarms is at 5 p.m. obviously I'll
be tweeting out the link and everything
but the link is down below as the
countdown has already begun also in this
video I'm gonna leave
customer service and inquiries link just
because I'll probably be read like
promoting this video when the match goes
up so if you have any problems or
anything there will be the people to
contact although I'm sure you won't have
any problems but if you do that would be
the place to get in contact with them
and if you're worried about if things
are going to sell out this is the best
part the company match that I have
teamed up with on this they are like a
print-on-demand company so they just
print so quickly but like as it's being
ordered if that makes sense like I
haven't got a limited stock I haven't
got like a limited quantity so you will
all be able to get your hands on
anything that you want because it's not
going to run out they're gonna print it
as long as you guys want it if that
makes sense so I was so so happy about
that cuz you see so many people that
just say that like it goes out of stock
and like you can't get your hands on
what you want to so this way you should
all be able to get your hands on
everything that you want like as much as
you want and it should all be okay thank
you guys again so so so much for
watching I really hope you guys love
everything that I'm coming out with like
I said in the comments let me know where
you're excited for if you're gonna get
anything let's just share the love in
the comments because I can't wait to see
you guys wearing everything and if you
do it definitely make sure to tag me and
just post it on your Instagram or
Twitter or whatever just show you that
you're wearing it give this video a
thumbs up if you're excited and
