so today I wanted to do more of a chatty
type of video I know I look like a super
down for that kind of thing I did do a
snapchat this makeup look and loads and
loads and loads of each of you guys want
to see a look for this so I definitely
make sure to do that next week also I do
have another video ideas next week I'll
let you guys know at the end of the
video you can let me know that something
that you want to see but yes today I
thought I would bring you at my kind of
current favorite so I went on like a
massive trying spree if that makes sense
I finally got around to try and loads of
new products that I received all the eye
patches and yeah I just thought I would
share my kind of current feeds or like
must have it so let's start with like
skin kind of products and I've been
banging on about this all month it's not
like a new product but the Bliss drench
and quench a moisturizer I'm pretty sure
you can see I'm on the last like dollar
honestly if you love like a wet skin
like wet to skin moisturizer type thing
you will absolutely loved it
I feel like it might be a little bit
pricey I might leave around like 25ish
pounds later the moisturizer but it
lasts so long you barely need any of it
is a hundred percent to me personally
I've got normal skin I would say I like
to think I've got dry skin therefore I
love products like this I mean you've
got really dry skin 100% recommend
trying this out I think it's sold and I
think someone that actually works and
lots of sponsors tweet me to say yes
they do send it months and Spence's
being seeded to try and get a sample of
something because I'm absolutely
obsessed with this I'm definitely going
to be repurchasing this 100% so yes I
moisturize a few I also have like a
couple of favorite combos if that
interests people but I've been really
loving and mixing it these two together
underneath my foundation so these other
hero drops make the hero project glow
drops they just launched on QVC UK so
I've left a link to them down below
they're like a facial oil but they
really don't need that much of an oily
residue
you know I've used my L'Oreal
extraordinary facial oils that one's
just kind of meant as a facial oil it
can be used under makeup I have used
under makeup but it's really good but
when I compare the two this one
definitely has a slightly drier finish
so I find works better under makeup and
then I absolutely love this primer
different
radiance primer this like although my
face is kind of buffed in and then this
on top could meet the most gorgeous
glowing skin I've ever seen if I had
like a natural tan and didn't mean
Dacian to be the color that I am I just
wear these two all day I mean 32-hour
pyrovile no burning on top but honestly
these two together are a dream if you
have dry skin definitely recommend
trying them out I mean if you have oily
skin you could try these out sometimes
social world actually quite good in
helping balancing out the skin I don't
know that's what this is designed to do
so don't like mark my word on it
but yeah I'm literally loving these two
together underneath my foundation like
after I do need identify foundation
until another facial product that I've
been loving at the moment and I knew I
was going to love it and I pretty sure I
told you guys I was going to love it is
that not that colour-pop the knockout
duo I mainly use the blusher I'm
actually in love with displeasure
I've actually ordered quite a few
blushes recently I'm kind of really in
the mood for blush I think is like the
spring and summertime I really love a
peachy flush on the cheek so when
colour-pop came out with this peach
collection I was like woo gimme and I
actually really like the kind of
highlight I don't use it personally as
like a highlighter highlighter more of
us could all over bloah but I love the
tulip colors of these so my blue eyes
and complexion they really kind of make
them pop and really compliment my skin
and so you've got a look at some of the
compression to me you think then I
definitely recommend trying these out
they're really gorgeous and super
pigmented as well the highlight is not
the most pigmented thing in the world
but I personally like that for what I'm
using it for
so yes the knockout so this is another
combination that I've been loving it is
mixing the fees to cover effects
enhancing drops in the shade moonlight
and sunlight sunlight is definitely more
of like a golden color and the moonlight
wine is definitely more of a Kapali
color so I love to mix them together I
actually kind of bust
I think the sunlight one just across my
dental college to make it glowy so I did
other kind of mixing them together on
the back of my hand getting my Beauty
Blender
and putting on my chases watch I have on
today and then I love to top it with the
sleep Cleopatra's kiss highlighting
these like if you want a popping
highlight i really recommend a cream and
then a powder i've always said a cream
underneath anything kind of helps them
any powder that you put on top pretty
cling to it and bring out it's like
pigmentation so it's no different when
it comes to highlighting and i've been
loving the color that these two create
and the kind of consistency that creates
on my skin and then talking it mixing
the two powder shades from the
cleopatra's kiss highlighting palette
from sleek which you guys know is one of
my top picks funds our website anyways
and their whole pro in general and it's
part of the campaign I don't find oh
thank you guys so much for the love on
that it makes my day seeing you guys
tweet the pictures from it yeah if you
haven't checked out or tried it yet this
is the like most affordable highlighting
palette I've ever like purchased in the
sense of like and it being good and it
be amazing so definitely try these
together if you haven't or as different
cream and like a palette or whatever
just I've been loving these at the
moment Rachel wait of mouth okay let's
move on to some I products I have
absolutely fallen in love with via
benefit precisely my brow pencil I used
to use the shade sport all the time
which is a tiniest bit too dark to use
completely all over my eyebrow and then
I recently picked up the shade 3.06
it is literally the perfect shade for me
to go kind of through the front of my
eyebrow and then I just kind of go I'm
now started to fill in my whole eye brow
with the shades three and then if I need
to just kind of deepen up the ends to
create that gradient effect I've been
loving these at the moment they're so
pigmented they laugh literally at the
longest time and I find I can yet be
really precise with my brow movement
kind of create that really nice
feathered effect at the front and
benefit brown roots in general are so
becoming like my go-to and favor
I haven't actually touched an anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in a long time
obviously love that but I've been
finding a pencil to the trick is so
quick so easy and I feel like with the
speed on the end is everything you just
get such a more natural brow and that's
something I've been really loving at the
moment and you guys have been saying
that you've been loving me doing it at
the moment so yeah I've been loving
these if you haven't tried any benefit
browser looks they have so so so many
kind of different ones to tailor any
sort of brow that you're after and
definitely check them out but this is my
recommendation
and precisely and my brow pencil okay so
another color pop thing I've been loving
and I've been just obsessed with or
months ever since I really got them are
color pop eyeshadows that single I chose
are crazy good these are the ones I have
I've just put them in an extra-large Z
palette obviously I reach for all the
kind of than that warm tones but they're
shimmers are stunning they are so
pigmented actually make a phenomenal
highlighter as well if you want a
multi-use your products they have some
really bright color than British I just
saw on the Instagram that they've come
out with really bright colors as well so
I'm excited to try those but yeah I bit
affect my go-to eyeshadow palette so
like anything I've always got it on my
desk it's not something I put away
because I'm always using them in all of
my makeup looks and that's I
deliberately want to be something
different but if I'm posing like might
go to brands I'm like my Instagram just
because the makeup was too good not to
share with you guys even though there's
probably like the same as I do all the
time
I've always use these colourpop's
eyeshadows so if you haven't checked
them out they're amazing and also
they're like shocked um supership one's
really good as well but I always find
they're a bit hit-and-miss
and you have to use like a thing or
whatever but these aren't these are like
super pigmented does exactly what it
says on the tin blend like a dream list
them so a brand was recently introduced
to and I'm instantly obsessed with is a
new lash brand and they are sold in a
super drug and they are pinky goat
lashes oh my god so if you're willing
that kind of mink lash effect but you
don't like the idea of kind of mink
eyelashes or you find that they're too
expensive for at the moment these are
amazing I'm wearing that r1 ones at the
moment and you've been looking at my
Instagram so like the only ones I have
been wearing I'm obsessed with them
these two styles as well as gorgeous
this isn't a style hair so I'll do a
close-up in a minute
these are slightly more rounded lash and
these ones are literally exclusive to
subscribe mandatory welcome today saw
them and it almost inspired me to do a
favorites video cuz I'm thinking I love
this prime like they are just producing
the most beautiful lashes ever in fact
that they're so loving superb materi now
super affordable too but these are in
the style rumor and they're exclusive to
super drug so I mean they have
when I say that they have that in
website where they sell them but they
also sold receive drug these ones will
only be sold in the soup drug so these
ones are in the style HESA as you can
see it they are super voluminous and
super rounded and wispy and just so
extra I'm obsessed
but I feel like these ones are going to
be at my newer go to as well as the are
ones I've got on these in the style
Ruba look at them they are so winged out
and fluttery and oh my god so these ones
are actually kind of more like silk made
so you get the effect of like an English
pub see it something I actually think I
have an extra pair of the are were
lashes that I've got on so I will
quickly show you the packaging with them
I did include them in a my vlog because
I received them as a PR thing something
to show you but these are the style
armor oh my god they're literally like
the most gorgeous fluttery winged out
lash ever I'm pretty sure they have
loads loads of other stars as well if
none of them kind of appealed to you
they're just kinda like my favorite ones
we got only literally assess them and
they're kind of a brand new brand to me
and they're currently like one I'm
actually loving at the moment so I've
got a couple of eyeliners I've been
loving at the moment and I used to not
really be one to wear anything in my
waterline and then I kind of discovered
these kind of tones and they're just a
bree olson product so and i've been
really loving the effect that they give
the first one is the urban decay 24/7
glide on pencil in the shade smog now
this is like a really gorgeous golden
brown I really don't like anything super
super dark and my water island only
eight complements my hands at all
especially black actually I really don't
like black in my waterline I mean I
don't mind it but like I don't think it
suits me innocently and that these kind
of softer Brown at colors they really
bring out my eyes personally if you've
got any tool kind of I think a brown is
such a nice alternative I mean a lot
softer easier on the eye if you still
want to wear me in your waterline and
then I've been kind of like smudge it
out underneath or whatever it's like a
really deep golden brown I think it's so
complimentary on my eyes and I've been
yeah like I said it really it loving
wearing that and then another one I've
been loving I've been loving the whole
range in general if the a Marc Jacobs
Highliner and Orange Crush now you might
think like why would you want something
orange in your waterline but if you've
got blue eyes I really recommend that
you try this
standing when you put it in your
waterline my eyes are literally like
popping out my skull it there it's so
gorgeous and it's such a nice
alternative as well it really brightens
up my eyes but without using like a nude
or white or something and then also
really brings out the color of my eye so
it's an all round like winner and the
pigmentation of these highlighters is
absolutely incredible and you get the
chance to get them actually I don't
think they're that expensive for an eye
liner kind of but I think they're
actually only twenty pounds and I know
Sephora stops the whole range of them
and I think only John Lewis and it
stocks the matte highliners this one's
more of their like shimmery one I'll
swatch it on my hand now for you and
show you I'm hoping that focus but yeah
the whole concept of them is that
they're like a gel pencil eyeliner so
they're designed to be super pigmented
and that orange shade I've just an
obsessed that like I said it really
brings out the color in my eyes and I
just love the color of it and I think
when I do like my favorite corporate
bronzy lips it's just a really gorgeous
kind of like final touch so it'd be a
final kind of eye product is like an
olden but like golden product I've
literally I've loved it for so long it's
been in a drawer and then I've only
really been reaching for it recently
because I forgot how friggin stunning it
is is the amok reflex bronze also
picking this out made me then go on to
the Mac website because I've linked this
product down below they do a reflex
copper and I had absolutely no idea that
went straight in my basket along with a
couple of other extra dimension blushes
so you've seen them being advertised at
the moment and we'll know they're like
I'll let you know so thanks to that but
the original one that I've been loving
is the reflex bronze their reflex
kinases are absolutely stunning you've
never tried them before honestly I would
recommend picking them up if you love it
there's glitter they're super super
refined so you can almost you can use
them with fix+ that's what we used to do
when I worked there and if you've
sprayed the customers I was six plus
first then you'll brush with the product
on mystic buzz and then pass it on and
then just kind of let let it dry
absolutely stunning but also there's
like eyeliner or like aya pieces that
would work really well if you wanted it
to be more other like intense packed on
of glitter honestly it just finish off
an eye look they do so many different
colors so many funky colors as well
there's loads of like white looking
ones that are like reflex peel or red or
pink so they just a dab really gorgeous
likely actually reflex of a color but
this one is obviously more like the
bronzy orange Iran loved it literally I
get so it so many confidence whenever I
wear this and people ask what it is my
favorite like eyeshadow topper type
thing I'm for a night out or something
if I want like a cup of smoky eye
honestly love it
can you tell down another because I do
and finally I have a couple of lip
products this is the makeup geek cream
stain in the shade dosey doe didn't
realize it was called that but that
cream stains in general I showed you
that I've received the collection of
them and you guys want to see like a lip
swatch video let me know that they're
cold cream stains but there's so I know
what the way they're just feel like
velvet what's that on your lips I
probably would have said this more like
a velvet type thing but I'll swatch
little this is obviously their nude one
obviously another good nude it looks
like that and that was literally just
with a couple of swatches they are so
gorgeous they have so many colors as
well so it doesn't pick up maybe a few
of the bright ones if you want to try
them obviously I recommend the nude I
really love this new is quite a cool
tone nude as well which kind of brings
mirrors the next product afterwards but
this is the one of the cooler tonot
nudes that they do all of them is
actually stunning I definitely think
those are bright colors as well perfect
for spring if you want to try one but if
you're really funky colors as well like
dark green and then grays and browns I'm
kind of like looking over there because
they're all SAP up there but they do
like reds and stuff on I think there's
such a gorgeous formula it's almost like
a liquid lipstick but like I felt like a
really soft one so that you don't like a
liquid lipstick because you think
they're quite drying definitely
recommend these out and put the word
it's stay in it so they do last a long
time as well so they're comfortable long
wearing at loads of different colors
it's makeup geek as well so I don't
think they're too drastically expensive
I just put a link to them at down below
do you want to check them out but I've
been really and then the packaging is
really like shaky so that's a plus and
smell and it be a final and little clock
the closet just gave away the final lip
products that I've been loving is a lip
gloss from soap &amp;amp; Glory this is the mini
version of the one that they sell this
came out in a Christmas
I think this mini one in particular was
from a Christmas collection I have
purchased the full-size one as well this
is be a sexy mother pucker at lipgloss
in candy queen I'm going to leave the
link down below to my friend amber she's
a makeup Arjun anyone who's ever doing
my makeup
it's her I'm pretty sure I have time to
earn a few pictures where she's done my
makeup and it's literally been it's
always always stunning she posted a
Instagram video of her lips with this on
and I messaged her and I was like oh my
god what is that on your lips forever
need it she said it was this when I got
it even though like I earned it up
already having it but it's on if you
selling it I like a nude lip gloss I'll
do a swatch for you but it's almost more
of like a pinkier tone so when you wear
cooler tone nudes or like if I like to
formula like a cooler tone new to
product and this one I want to wear this
almost just like warms it up slightly is
that makes sense the whole sexy at
mother pucker lips range is stunning I
love all the colors and stuff in the
formula of them and it's like a plum
English as well I literally love
parenting classes and that one in lovely
in the drugstore is like a really
affordable good one and they have such
gorgeous glitters running through it as
well I'll leave the link to Amber's
video of it on her lips down below so
you can actually see it on tell me if
you watch that video that you don't work
out and buy that because she makes it
look so good I don't know if you can see
but yeah it has a slightly pink
undertone and like glitter running
through it which I absolutely love and
it's from so from Laurie as well so it's
super affordable but yeah it's just a
lip gloss that whenever I put a nude lip
on I've just kind of gone - I mean I
have so many nude lip glosses I apply
like loads and loads of different ones
but I really love the formula of these
and at this color in particular is
actually stunning
