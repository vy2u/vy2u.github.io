today I'm doing a so different and more
fun video I've always wanted to do this
kind of video it is a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A if
you don't already follow me on snapchat
I'll get there because you definitely
should I'm always posting like new
makeup tips and alcoholic beverages and
just kind of filming my general drunk
and nights off so definitely make sure
to follow me on there yes I opened up my
snapchat do a public yesterday and asked
you guys to send me in your video
questions so I could open them alive on
camera and yeah just answer your
questions and then you can kind of see
yourself in the video so it's the first
time I've ever done this so I'll see how
it goes I'm scared I'm going to get like
weird questions but I did ask you send
in your video so if you sent me like I
did also send in a video so that all the
ones I am going to be opening all
there's something really weird has
happened and it said like open those and
I haven't so I'm so so so sorry if you
guys are one of the first people to send
me in something and it's like sighs I've
opened it and I'm not done showing it on
can my breathe don't know why that's
happened so again it massive apology so
I'll land that for next time so maybe I
won't leave it so long yeah I'm just
going to go ahead and start from the
most recent videos and then answer your
questions so this one is from Nisha I
love you too my biggest inspiration is
protein I'm assuming you mean like
makeup so I would probably have to say
like Instagram and stuff or the people
that I am friends with through it like
I'm so inspired by everyone like around
me I get inspired by like artwork maybe
like in terms of like colors and just
seeing how things work together but no I
definitely say I'm mainly inspired by
like my feeds and like the people that I
hang around with and what they're doing
and all that kind of stuff I feel like I
learned so much from other people
youtubers like your trucks reach you
favor youtubers way too much pinky that
for example I mean usually I love to
watch a Michael French Charlie I
fricking love them also I love to watch
all my friends like Hannah and Amy and
CeCe and I all of them I also love
watching something where I watch covers
TV any of you guys watch that it's like
like a news YouTube channel I really
like that i also really love
choreography
youtube channels as well I know they're
not like specific youtube but I love
that kind of stuff in general
they're tips on keeping on your makeup
all day especially if you're working try
today even my makeup well a day
definitely like a primer that has a lot
of glycerin in it so it's super sticky
because I feel like my makeup really
clings to it my definitely a hundred
sensual to like baked on my face with a
loose translucent powder and then just
kind of set it all with powder as well
they're like my top tips and then like a
setting spray this is Lauren hi Rachel
my name's Lauren I'm from the United
States and my question for you is you
had recommend one makeup item to what am
I going to cut you off but we have to
recommend one makeup item to a makeup
lover I'm guessing like what would it be
Mac reflex glitters I feel like they
don't get spoken about but they are
absolutely stunning they have so many
cool colors and yeah I literally look at
them this is from Laura how it truly
literacies and my question is if you
could have done one thing in your life
differently what would it be and why
thank you so much I I could do one
during my life differently I feel like
nothing in the sense that it's led me to
where I am now I like Bruni happy with
where I am now I feel like everything
happens for a reason so like if I did
something differently it might change
the future of like of where I am but I
think maybe just like when you have like
little friendship fall outs and stuff
maybe I'll feel like something
differently on but not done the thing
that cause before up I feel like I said
everything happens for a reason so I
can't really I probably say one
combusted so I just wanted to know have
you tried online dating and if so what
has been your worst online dating
experience
oh my god already sick American people
is so cool thank you and I never tried
online dating and I've never had tender
or anything like that that whole concept
me scares me because it's I don't want
to get catfished my gosh I don't really
have any like stories about that kind of
stuff you know but I wish I did my
friends have some artsy outrageous
stories I've read that happening to a
video with my friends food like one of
my best friend Alex is like some of the
 funniest stories ever he's
actually nuts and famous like my other
friends as well so let me know that's
something you want to see like a Q&amp;amp;A
with my
friends this is from Megan favorite
perfumes I love Jimmy Choo blossom I
have this long-term Victoria Secret it
could like intense and I freaking love
that and there's a new YSL one which I
am at freaking obsessed I can't remember
the name but I'm having to get my hands
in it really soon I like anything that's
really sweet
I'm also a massive fan of Britney Spears
fantasy the pink one I know that's so
old-school but I love things I like
super super sweet this is from yves
videos just way too many i'm getting
started in strong for you to love you
too and if your makeup is incredible
excuse the crazy hat babe i have the
like crazy of hair ever don't worry but
any tips from starting just think
outside the box
youtube and instagram is just growing so
fast at the moment of everyone just like
everyone doing it so you need to do
something that's going to make you stand
out what makes you different from all
the rest that's going to push you out
there and all that kind of stuff like
everything's just going at such a pace
but if you want to make sure that you
are able to stand out from the crowd so
just maybe like alternative looks or
think what is like what do you want to
see on youtube and like create that kind
of content and just 100% make sure
you're enjoying what you're doing so
it's a hundred so it's genuine and it's
like yeah stuff that you enjoy because
otherwise you'll just lose the
inspiration and the motivation and then
you have you able to get anywhere so I
think I answered your question this is
from Sophie I think you alright my
favorite beauty product right now
probably the new Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid glows this one is in the shade
peach says I'm obsessed and I would like
to put a powder highlighter on top but
I'm literally living to these they blend
out like a dream and yeah I'm just
living for them at the moment oh my god
this is from Caitlyn she always comments
on my stuff so thank you
my favorite snapchat filter is probably
the one that makes you look like the
bigmouth one you know I mean I was
looking at love that one and I feel like
it always had like a do it sometimes
well it does to me anyway and it just
makes me look even funnier but I really
miss the like halo angel one that made
everyone look pain I miss it I wanted to
come back so that probably was my
favorite one when it was around she
asked me another question but it's crazy
imma go she often quite you and I
actually liked it what is my type on
paper it's funny because my type is not
you guys actually probably don't know
this but rachel has a boyfriend now but
my type on paper will be like isn't my
boyfriend if that makes sense so I don't
really have a type like I feel that
everyone has probably told off enhance
more ever but I feel like that's just
like I don't know hard to find and then
have a personality to match someone
that's able to make me laugh as a saying
like banter as me get on with all my
friends obviously has to be like
good-looking just because you've got
have like that sexual attraction you
know and after the other question
connector I was going on a question I
get all the time I hate answering and I
don't know sometimes when people ask me
like what like about makeup advice it's
really hard to everyone like not because
I don't like those questions but it's
more just because like everyone's so
different like I don't want to tell you
that that's what you want to get like
that's the only thing that you want to
get or anything because it might work
for me but then you might buy it and it
might not work for you in it and I'm Pro
don't want you to think like gave you
like a shiny recommendation so those
kind of questions I get like a bit like
I don't to say they're just in case it
doesn't work for you but it's not
because I hate those kind of questions
you know I mean but you did not meet you
but I want to like move on the child you
kidding because you always come on all
my stuff and support me so yes I already
answered that one so now you know
if I could speak to any animals what
would I say I don't know I probably
talked like cats and dogs and stuff and
just see like yeah
how does feeling today actually really
want me to scratch their head they're
actually I mean like I'd love to be able
to hear the animals voice back I always
imagine what people's pets voices like
would tell I did they have one that
sounds really weird but now or like I
talked to an animal that's like usually
seen as really aggressive and just see
if they're like actually not I don't
know that's such a weird question like I
really like that question but it makes
me think and really makes you think you
know this one is from Mary Parish what's
your favorite one or even a diamond in
that video only couple don't tell me
love you too my favorite restaurant is
probably STK I've ever been once and
you're probably thinking right so how is
it your favorite restaurant but I don't
want to overdo it but it's honestly I'm
such a state likes I love steak and
knives like one of the best steak
restaurants I've ever been to let me
know other good steak restaurants I've
had that flat iron is really good as
well so yeah let me know in the comments
humble that you love steak like me and
you have a favorite restaurant because I
feel like I need to try it mom this is
from early a thank you if I want to lost
you what I do depends on the amount that
I won let's say it's like and then 100
million I probably I get will not
probably I'd give a lot to my family
donate a lot there I think I invest in a
few things as well maybe like things
abroad in terms of in terms of like
charities and stuff so maybe help fund a
few things I probably buy a few
properties maybe and but yeah just
donate a lot and buy a lot of bags who
do I want to win love island oh my god I
think it's so annoying
I'm like in love with Chris which I
absolutely hate Olivia and like if she
he's the only reason that she's still in
it like if he was with someone else be
so much better I think Ken and amber are
going to win out I don't know why I just
feel like they are because they're like
the most genuine
kind of couple I might even sure spinach
I won't win I actually have no idea I'd
be happy live anything won excerpts I
really don't want a Montana to win now
you can tell I think had catch for your
cousin kind of coming out you can tell
the kind of like girl that she was in
school and she just seems really bitchy
these days I hate that I don't think
that there's like love there I think
kemon amber actually have love so in
terms of I love Ireland
I think they should win you're slaying
that winged jazz I don't know like I
said YouTube is just growing it so so
like quickly at the moment I feel like
no one's really doing just like makeup
tutorials anymore which is such a shame
like everyone's got into the whole
vlogging side of things and I feel like
you just have to keep pushing your
content out like even if it's really
unmotivated due to the fact that you
haven't got many followers now you just
have to keep going you have to remember
like all these people with millions and
millions for ages probably only had like
100 200 like everyone always says it's
like one video so you just need to like
keep going and that would like hopefully
happen that for you I mean make sure
it's dipped it's the content that you
love and just make sure that your titles
are really short sweet the point your
thumbnails are really kind of just like
what is you know I mean all those kind
of things that you look for in a youtube
video when you're searching and you're
watching people videos just do not
obviously don't copy but just like the
inspired marketing here so my favorite
meal is 100% stick I love steak like I
really could just go on and on about
steak of how much I love it I love
calamari as well but yeah steak as a
creamy mushroom sauce either some sort
of like potatoes or a chips of a rocket
salad oh my god you've won my heart from
oh my god Hannah says what's your go-to
a drink on a night out and double Malibu
and cranberry or double vodka lime
lemonade or and way
and a side of a Tokina rosacea or a
double gin and passionfruit and lemonade
so a good go and drier if you would
start a makeup line what would be the
first product you create and Alice from
Annie the first product I would create
would probably be like a face palette I
feel like I love a shimmery bronzer like
a bronze lurkin I feel like that might
be something you guys associate with me
as well so maybe like a free face
palette with like a matte bronzer a
shimmery bronzer and then like a really
like a blinding champion gold highlight
that kind of thing then just like be
looking to the person to do that with
that's going to be the last question so
it is asking if I'm doing a meet-up in
London and yes I am doing a meet-up in
London or details will be revealed it is
like with a brand but it is it will be
in August in a occipital fool I'm not
going to say it to to too much but I
want to be kind of more personal so
there will be tickets to it not that you
pay for but you guys want the chance to
win them so it's quite it's like a
limited amount and obviously like if
more people come and there's time then
then they've said that like anyone can
come in but we are going to make some
quite limited because I want to be able
to spend time with each and every one of
you and taught you to take pictures just
like have a chat and that kind of stuff
so it's quite limited and I never really
do meet up so I didn't want to just like
say I'm having one I'm like then no one
that comes I like I want it to be a bit
more like formal organized which is why
I'm doing that but yes stay tuned for
that in the next coming weeks for the
chance to come and meet me and like come
say hi because they were all your
questions thank you guys so much for
setting them in so again I'm so so sorry
if you sent me in a question and like it
said I've opened it and I didn't end
like actually I read it or what happened
then I tried to answer as many as I can
without making this too long but I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
excessively make sure to give it a
thumbs up if you want me to do it more
people just like other types of Q&amp;amp;A and
