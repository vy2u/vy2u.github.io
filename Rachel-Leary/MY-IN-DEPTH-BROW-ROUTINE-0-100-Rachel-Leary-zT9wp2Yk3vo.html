so today is my long-awaited updated brow
routine ever since I went to Los Angeles
if you are new here welcome hit that
subscribe button before you continue but
I did go to Los Angeles like a couple of
weeks ago very very luckily with via
unique calm and anastasi at Beverly
Hills
it was a oppress'd trip as anastasi
Beverly Hills has now launched all of
her makeup on feel unique calm was very
lucky enough to get my brows done by
anastasiya herself yes if you don't know
who Anastasio Beverly Hills is where
have you been under no eyebrow zone Rock
she very kindly did our eyebrows using
her own personal techniques and tricks
and how she looks at eyebrows and does
them if you just want to see how I do at
my brows feel free to skip ahead in the
video but I just thought I would share
some insight into Anastacio Beverly
Hills and just talk to you a little bit
about this like how it she does them
because I found it so so so interesting
when she told me about keep it as brief
as possible so before we get started
let's talk about anasazi Beverly Hills
her history I think she said she was
from Romania and she only had studied
makeup briefly and before that she did
kind of mechanics and science and all
that kind of stuff so she kind of
combines the two together and she's very
intellect with The DaVinci Code and all
of that stuff so saw the face as very
kind of mathematical scientific and
structural so when it comes to at the
angles at the face she's very kind of
into it and knows exactly the placement
of each thing hence why the products
that she brought out first were like a
contour kits and a brows because they
are a very very structural part of the
face when she first moved to Los Angeles
she didn't really speak much English so
all she could really do is be like an
aesthetician which is just someone that
does like your brows and stuff because
you don't really need to speak to be
able to do that and she came over a time
web browsers weren't really even a thing
she just kind of rented a room in a
beauty salon offering it to do at
people's eyebrows using eyeshadow and
water to create like a pomade and she
started to build up a big clientele
because like I said no one was doing
eyebrows no one was fitting them in and
people were seeing the difference that
it made it to their faces and were just
spreading the word and loving it and
then one day this woman came in and put
her brows down my Anastacio fell in love
and said you know what their angular
brings
in tomorrow to get her brows done - so I
want you to do her eyebrows so the lady
that came in to originally get her
eyebrows done was Cindy Crawford agent
who then the next day brought in Cindy
Crawford to get her eyebrows done and
that's kind of where it all started
Cindy Crawford fell in love spread the
word with all her celebrity friends and
that is how a Nastasia kind of grew in
the celebrity eyebrow world and became
the phenomenal a business woman that she
is today
honestly when she was telling me all
this stuff I was just so like infatuated
with what she was saying she is such an
interesting so intelligent woman I'm not
even joking but anyways she then went
ahead and told us how she sees how
eyebrows which I actually do talk about
in the video so I will leave that then
she's very into the more kind of natural
brow nothing too too too heavy so her
techniques are very simple yet effective
and kind of take a little bit of
patience but you achieve kind of the
best looking brow for your shape which I
do go and talk about in the video so I
really hope you guys appreciate that I
really hope you guys learn something
know maybe learn a few more techniques
and tricks like I did and get the best
brows that you can I hope I explained it
in a way that is easy to understand I
don't know if you guys see my like
before-and-after over my brows I mean
you do in most videos but I really hope
you guys find this video helpful if you
do make sure to give it a thumbs up
before we continue
but obviously without further ado let's
get started with the video and let's get
serious with our brows okay so I'm gonna
go ahead and just do this brow to show
you so I can do a at comparison so the
first thing you wanna do is kind of make
sure that you've got the shape in check
before you do anything I've never seen
anyone use their like spoolie and of a
brush as much as she did she honestly
used it as long as her main tools so you
just want to make sure that all your
brush all your brow hairs are relatively
short so what she did was a brush them
all kind of upwards and the ones towards
at the top if they were kind of a long
she would give them a trim so just like
those ones that you can see here I'm
just gonna give them a little trim then
also she would go in and just kind of
pluck away at any kind of stray hairs
now this is just gonna give you like a
good base to start with just like your
makeup or anything like
that you just want to make sure that
your brows are as like tidy as possible
and then that makes everything a lot
easier for you so it's kind of easy to
find where kind of stray hairs are just
the ones that don't really follow the
shape of your brow I remember when I was
sat down in the chair she was like do
you mind and literatures just like you
know what do what you want so just kind
of like the stray hairs around the brow
so I like to do my brows kind of just
before I do my highlight but I've
normally done at the rest of my face if
you're quite like a messy person kind of
like to use a lot of concealer maybe go
ahead and do it your brows first but she
was quite happy to do with my brows when
I had my makeup done and that's just
kind of the way that I do them to now in
terms of the shape she said that they
should always start in line with your
nose the highest point of your brow
should be from the nose all the way kind
of at that angle and the distance should
be the size of your eye between so she
made mine a lot more arched as you can
see that's kind of the shape that I've
still kept and it made such a difference
so that for me was a big difference so
like I said you want to keep a eyes
distance between your lashline and the
highest point of your brow so there's a
tip for you if you didn't know that and
then the end of your brow kind of ends
at this angle or like length so I did
tell her I was like my brows are
naturally really short and that's why I
always like to do my brows before my
highlight because I need a little bit of
product they're drawing product on top
of highlight can be difficult cuz
highlights really like to show any
surface but now we've got the shape in
check we can go ahead and fill them in
so Anastasia's technique for filling
brows in is to go in with a pencil first
and I'm obviously gonna be using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz to do
so this is just a lot more of like a
defined a pencil and like a micro pencil
and that's the kind of thing that I have
always loved I've always loved her brow
Wiz or any sort of micro brow pencil so
I was so glad that she use this and the
color that I'm going to be using is
taupe now I'd never used tote before I
always use medium brown but her
technique is to go in with a lighter
shade of brows and then a darker shade
of the dip brow pomade now you want to
do that because the light pencil is
if the illusion of the shadow that your
hair's already create so like when you
brush up your hairs and stuff there is a
light shadow underneath and that's kind
of what you're mimicking with the pencil
so the pencil is used to fill in like
the base of the brows I'm just gonna
raise my brow to tighten the skin and
just go ahead and trace now back in the
day I always kind of filled in and
extended the bottom of my eyebrow and
that's what made it look a bit thicker
but she told me that I needed to extend
on the top of my brow now to make it
easy for yourself you can draw your
guide lines in so I'm just gonna do a
little dot here with the pencil to show
where my brow should start the highest
point of my brow should be here and then
my brow should end yeah where I was kind
of doing it around there now I can just
go ahead and fill in were basically just
filling in the shadow that's already
there so just go tracing the bottom of
the brow just following it around it
doesn't have to be too too neat to start
with because we will go ahead and tidy
it up but then what she did do was a
brush all the brow hairs down just so
she could see like what parts she hasn't
thought in and kind of go in with these
like downwards motions and then brush
them all up and then just go in where
the shadow is and already this is
creating a really natural looking
eyebrow and then as you get towards the
front of the brow she made sure to go in
kind of more circular motions like going
back up into the eyebrow kind of thing
and then always going back in with that
spoolie brush to diffuse it out now
that's kind of it for the pencil side of
things I'm now gonna go in with a dip
brow this is
like a most infamous product and it's
worth the best products ever now she
said for this part because this is where
you do it they're defining you want a
really firm angled brush so this is her
brush in number 14 I have left the links
to all of these down below but this is
considerably darker than the taupe dip
brow and what you want to do is just
kind of take a bit of product on the
brush just by kind of like tapping it in
and then brushing one of the majority of
it off so you barely have kind of any on
the brush and what you're going to be
using this for is the mimicking of the
brow hairs so you're only gonna be doing
light strokes going through so for me I
need to kind of concentrate this most
towards the end of the brow because
that's where I don't have any hair and I
need to like mimic the appearance of her
always just make sure to like brush off
product if you feel like you've got too
much because it is so easy to just plonk
a ton of product on and you've done
suddenly got these Scouse brows he
doesn't mean to harm can you see it just
looks a lot more natural and that was
the part that kind of like shipped me
the most was just how swapping around
your products and using science and just
really thinking about like what you're
doing rather than what actually looks
like good if that makes sense really can
create such a different brow and really
transform your face Sohn literally just
following the direction of my hairs and
drawing them in so I'm just gonna add a
couple more on the top there just to get
a little more shape and brush through
like she always did literally every step
always brushing through but this brush
is honestly insane it is so small and so
defined if you've got a slightly thicker
brow you might want a slightly thicker
brush so example her brush in number
twelve would be amazing to get the
similar effect but can you see it really
does look like a naturally more filled
brow obviously we need to just tidy up
underneath slightly but honestly just
using
that lighter pencil to create the
illusion of shadow and then going in
with the darker brow hairs that kind of
match the color of your brows to create
the illusion of more brow hairs just
creates the most perfect eyebrow and
also knowing how to shape your brow too
so knowing when to start the distance
that you should have and where it should
end will honestly change the shape of
your face completely and this is where I
mean when I say brows make such a
difference so when it came to it using
concealer underneath the brow I know a
lot of us like to conceal all the way
across
she said that was like her biggest pet
peeve and like it's not what you're
meant to do because when you highlight
your face for example you want to
highlight the higher suite and it's
exactly the same with your eyebrow you
want to highlight the highest points so
I'm gonna take the pro pencil in base 2
which is a really nice natural color for
me and you just want to kind of
concentrate it mainly on the highest
point of the brown which is OC your ahh
so that's where she placed like majority
of her product she then it took a brush
number 20 which is a really amazing flat
top brush and what you do is then use
that brush to sculpt and add more
precision in terms of placement of the
product and just dragging it down to
blend so you can get a bit of like a
more defined tail of the brow and then
any of the excess product not any
product placed there you can use it to
tidy the front if needs be like so now
I'm just gonna kind of take that brush
too tightly at the top just from we're
brushing through a little bit took off a
bit of me foundation that's why that
brush is so good to do that you can be
is so precise and that once you're happy
with that is our finished brow I mean
I'm never ever gonna be able to do it
the way that she did my eyebrows she is
the Queen and she had a lot more of the
knowledge like in her head
look at the difference it's definitely a
lot more arch than they used to have it
if you are a subscriber of mine you know
I used to have quite straight brows but
honestly I'm having unlock more of an
arch brow really elongated in my face
and it was all to just do with knowing
where to place each angle she does do a
brow kits that have the kind of stencil
in it and can help you yeah I just feel
like this technique has honestly changed
my life and if you've never used that
kind of technique before and you're
struggling with your eyebrows to look a
bit more on the natural side definitely
give it a go go for a lighter brow with
a darker per made with a really precise
precision brush only highlight the
highest point of your brow and really
try and get nailed that shape but once
you're happy with your eyebrow you can
go ahead and lock it in place using a
clear eyebrow gel and this also just is
great to feather up your brow and just
give it a little more texture and make
sure it's not going anywhere
so yeah I'll give you a quick
before-and-after again to the main tips
I would take from this video is one make
sure that they're all kind of primed
trimmed and ready by just plucking the
excess brow hairs once you know the
shape that you're going for and it cuts
away at all of the longer hairs towards
the top of the brow you want to measure
from the nose this is where your brow
should be at its highest point and the
highest point should be an eye width
apart and then the end of your brow and
here always fill from above never trying
to lower your brow and highlight the
highest points using a more natural
highlighting
I hope you found those tips and tricks
and really helpful I'm now gonna go
ahead and do the other browser so I can
show you at their met together and then
I will be back to finish the video and
now this is both brows done so you can
