channel so today we are doing a cute and
hey well love it these are Q&amp;amp;A type
videos I always want them to be like
personal and juicy I try and answer
makeup related questions as much as I
can on like my Instagram and you guys
kind of comment and ask them and on here
I just want to do a more kind of like
deep and personal questions interesting
questions
dirty questions that kind of things you
guys can get to know me a bit more and
just kind of see more of my personality
so instead of Twitter this time or
snapchat or something I asked you guys
to ask me questions on my Instagram if
you don't follow me on my Instagram at
make sure you do that now I love
Instagram stories love Instagram in
general so make sure to go and follow me
on there to kind of see what makeup
picks and stuff that I don't always go
to here on my youtube channel so I'm
literally gonna go through the questions
quickfire as many as I can
I literally asked you guys an hour ago
to comment and there's 200 comments plus
already so I'm gonna literally or west
through these as quick as I can
the first questions from lib and let's
just get things started sheep says
what's your middle name my middle name
is Elizabeth Cameron Thomas says the
weirdest place you had sex best friend's
bedroom floor Hanna makeup says most
recent picture in your camera roll well
I just took a few like selfies of this
makeup and they're no fun but the one
before that is this kind of like meme a
picture of Rihanna sorry it really made
me laugh Chloe having zli it says
weirdest thing a guy has ever said to
you um funny that you say that was going
through my Instagram dm's earlier I'm
like I have some weird DMS from like
really old men and probably just someone
offering me 20,000 pounds to go just for
dinner I guess that's kind of weird
I can't think of anything else that's
weird I'm sure on nights out people have
said like weird things to me I can't
really remember I think I had like a
really weird chap my months now sat down
got outside of a nightclub and this guy
came up to me and said oh my god nice
boots and I was like oh thanks I got
them from Bella Rania's no no sorry I
meant nice boobs and you know and it's
just like okay I don't know how to
pronounce this fat G Oh bet Jase
Sinclair said best and worst traits
about yourself that's a good question I
feel like my best trait might be I don't
feel like I'm very argumentative I would
rather not argue and I'm quite
understanding I feel like I can see
besides the story and would rather just
like not argue about it my worst trait I
do think I'm right a lot of the time or
like my waves like the best where you
kind of thing or which can probably be
very annoying I'm always on my phone
again very annoying I'm quite a good
liar as well I thought my friends might
be like no you're not that I am like I
am which is not a good quality to have
oh my god the same girl says do you get
hangover anxiety as in fear of what
you've done the night before oh my god
is that thing because yes half the time
I get really drunk I can't remember a
thing anything I've said what I've done
and it's actually a terrifying which is
why why don't when New Year's
resolutions is to like not really drink
during the week and like really conv
June
about about how I am drinking because I
feel like it might be affecting my brain
Meaghan underscore and Lily Jane says
what's the worst thing you've done at
drunk details please
um I think and the worst thing I've done
when I'm drunk kind of in terms of maybe
like embarrassment
I was once going out with the girls I
used to work with and I drank like a
quarter of a bottle of Syrah and squirt
bottles like big it's imagine that's
like that much vodka and I'd filled the
rest up with lemonade and it was a mango
flavor so it's actually really really
drinkable I drank like that up on the
train journey to London because we were
going through my hairs really we were
going out in London and literally by the
time I'd got there I was absolutely
wasted like we were queuing for the kerb
and I remember I couldn't even walk I
could barely understand I'm surprised
they even let me and I think it's
because we had a table but before we've
got shown to our table and we've sat
down on these like benches waiting I had
to grab one of those like fancy white
cups that they have in all those London
curbs was sit in it and just basically
said bye oh my god I have to go bear in
mind this is like 11:00 p.m. like we
haven't even sat at the table yeah we've
come all the way to London I've just
been sick in a cup in front of everyone
and I got uber the whole way home and I
don't even London I live an hour and a
half out of London and then gone uber
the whole way home I think that's
probably been like the worst thing I've
done because that NASA space race Tilia
says have you ever done something bad
and blamed it on someone else or what's
the biggest lie that you've told and
yeah I've done something bad and lean on
someone else
I'm biggest lie I've ever told probably
saying I didn't sleep with someone when
I did because I knew it was gonna be an
issue
or someone else that was a long time ago
by the way k-19 or KL 9 says tell us
your complicated relationship explain it
Rachel um I've actually seen a few
comments on this I seen a few comments
on this and a few of comments on
actually I said to you a lot there's a
lot of comments on this a lot like drunk
story comments so well I can see what
you guys are really interested in it's
complicated
I'm just so unsure of what I want that I
just keep going around in circles and
it's not good for me it's not good for
them but it's not damn complicated
anymore we've come to like an agreement
type thing so yeah single if anyone's
got any tall dark and handsome friends
let me know grace under school kiss-kiss
says have you ever suffered from anxiety
and if so what's your advice now my
friend said to me the other day that
they feel that like everyone suffers
from anxiety at times and I actually
really agree with that I'm not diagnosed
with anxiety I don't get it really bad
but I get super super anxious about
certain things so I guess that's a form
of anxiety but I get anxious about like
weird weird things like I can't face a
lot of things and the thought of doing
things like socially and stuff makes me
really really anxious so I don't know I
guess that's kind of like a form of
anxiety I don't get it
both for me and I'm definitely not
diagnose there what's your advice and I
feel like because I don't have it a
comedy give advice but maybe just take
yourself out the situation deep breaths
do something that relaxes you that kind
of thing I literally like I'm not the
person to ask that kind of thing but I
just thought I would mention about the I
feel like everyone has a form of anxiety
in some ways because I feel like that's
true and certainly one two three says
have you ever been on a really
embarrassing date I'm not really like
being on a date and that's another like
New Year's resolution like a mental one
in my head is I wanna go on more like
dates I don't take things just like too
seriously I think and I feel like dates
have to mean something and all of this
kind of stuff and I feel like they don't
people just go on random dates all the
time and it's like nothing I think it
just makes you more confident as a
person and put yourself out there a bit
more and open to the idea of
relationships and more you're after so I
have already been on embarrassing date
because I'm not really being on a proper
date so yeah
Maryana deep tree says where the sexual
experience love you love you to win a
sexual experience and probably when I
went on a holiday like a girls holiday
and there was like a
competition but we went to like one of
those beach parties that you go on like
with your reps and all that kind of
stuff but now it's in the competition
and I was quite drunk and I just got up
onto the stage and like partook in the
competition and there were loads of
brownies and stuff and like one of them
but literally this is on a stage in
front of like hundreds and hundreds of
people I don't know why I think my
friends like pushed me up onto that I
don't know but you have yet to get up
onto the stage and do all do all these
crazy things and like one of them luck
was like sex positions one one of them
was like unknown basically just like
dancing on these people but I really
love to dance I don't know I just like I
love dancing and so I had like a great
time but it was Mickey it's actually
weird I don't know I'm just fun about so
many people and just yeah let loose yeah
okay 27 says what's your favorite
alcoholic drink and non-alcoholic drink
favorite alcoholic drink is a probably a
porn star martini or just like a glass
of wine like Rosie or Pinot one of them
and non-alcoholic drink probably a mango
iced tea Abbey mint said weird I know
but have you ever weed yourself in a
public place
hell yeah you think I got time to go
into the toilet and I'm flying around
outside the club in my heels no I'm
going behind a car Caroline Wilkie says
from my personal question what's your
favorite sexual position yeah I went
that low love you rage uh Colorado right
my son I wanna jump juicy and personal
question so I don't really know I
thought you guys gonna ask my favorite
sexual position is where you cross your
legs and tell them to hurt on friends
underscore little black raincloud says
do you have any embarrassing period
related stories oh my god yeah I do like
I my parents I'm so bad it's like well
it used to be back so bad and so heavy
I've had so many like times where I've
like leaks everywhere or yeah just like
leaks everywhere in clothes and stuff
they actually got to put my used to cap
when I was on my period I'd have to
carry around like a spare pair
pants with me like just in case it was
always that bad but I think the worst is
embarrassing experience I've had is when
you're not sleeping in your bed and like
I said I think I slept over at my
friend's house like we just had a
sleepover and I woke up and I'd like
period it and her bed obviously girls
understand she was a really good friend
so she was absolutely good okay but
obviously I was completely rumen is that
Romana
begum under school o-62 pretty sorry if
I've got that wrong what do you look for
in guys when do you want to get married
and how many kids do you want love you
lots
lovey - and what do I look for in guys
someone who's funny can make yeah so it
can make me laugh really caring
understanding I obviously have to be
attracted to them so for me that kind of
means ideally like my type inside hall
for a muscular dark and handsome
I like facial hair I kind of like
tattoos they have to be smart to be able
to have like an intellectual
conversation with them ideally a little
bit older than me as well as like that's
what I look for well that's what now I'm
looking for kind of thing when do you
want to get married I think there's like
I want to get married late twenties
maybe so I can have start having kids
around that sort of time - I'm not even
sure that I even want kids I'm literally
not maternal at all but I feel like
that's because I've never had a
long-term relationship with someone to
be like oh my god okay you know what I
want you to like have my kids I mean I
actually more recently I've been a
little bit maternal like I do I feel
like it's just your burner meant to have
kids you know I feel like I am meant to
do that but I wouldn't be the end of the
world it's like I was someone's like fun
aren't type thing but ideally if I did
then dead have kids I would probably
have like I'm not sure Emma Thomas says
what's the highest body count a guy
could have before you were put off by
them ah I don't know I mean that's not
really something I thought about or like
asked I mean you know you always you're
always gonna be a little bit curious but
never really like lost probably over at
my age of 21 over like 50 I think that's
like that just shows you're not serious
and just a bit of a user an appeaser
Amy learn to two forces have you ever
had lip injections if no why not no I've
never had lip injections before my lips
are kind of naturally quite big as they
are but I have actually been thinking
about it just because it's really
annoying I have this like dip in my lip
that I always like obviously you fell in
with a pencil and I always always always
in my pictures like kind of like push my
lips out for them to look a little bit
fuller so in my head I just kind of
think well why don't I just get like
like the smallest amount you can get
like give myself the natural like
fullness that I pretend that I've got
and then sort out the unevenness like
I'm not sure but then the thought of
like needles and stuff makes me cringe
and it would be me that it goes wrong
for like I just know it would be so I
don't know I'm still like waiting
whether or not I wear my mom would
probably kill me Jessica Helius excess
body count girl what a personal question
I'm not gonna I'll let you guys like
gasp for a little second like have a
thing but probably less than you think
and it's actually single figures oh yeah
I'm gonna finish on this one solo 92
says how did you and Amy come to meet
Theo and Alex I've always wanted to know
I didn't realize people realized that we
knew them obviously Amy's going out with
Alex or like seeing Alex whatever so
that's obvious and that's that's kind of
how I met them anyway and through Amy's
makeup books so that was my personal
