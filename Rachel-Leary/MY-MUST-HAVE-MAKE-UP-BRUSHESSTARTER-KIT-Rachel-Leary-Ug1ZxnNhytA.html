today I'm going to be doing one of my
most requested video I don't know why so
much recently but I've just been seeing
so many comments recently that you guys
want me to do a must have or a starter
kit video on makeup brushes because
there are so many makeup brushes out
there so like literally every part of
your face I feel like people have their
own preferences of what the first
brushes to do for them and all that kind
of stuff so I thought I would do a video
on basically my must-have makeup brushes
that I would get to do at my face out
there are some little extra ones thrown
in it I probably could do eye makeup
without but like I just really love them
but as someone that is fortunate enough
to only to like hundreds and hundreds of
makeup brushes I don't have tried to
narrow it down to a left so overwhelming
amount and yeah so you guys can see what
kind of brushes I use what I think you
should have just to kind of create like
a ground things like this like all of
these brushes I would have used to
create a look like this so if you'da
part of them might be a little bit dirty
as well so it was out me rambling on if
you kind of like these must-have type
videos make sure to give it a thumbs up
and subscribe if you haven't already
probably love to see you in the next
video but without further ado let's go
ahead get started I'm kind of going to
go through them in the order that I
would use them so I'm wondering if you
guys probably guess on the brush that
I'm going to use the first brush I am
going to mention is the Real Techniques
multi-task face brush now you can use
this brush for literally anything like I
said it's a multitask face brush I think
Lauren practice back in the days to use
this for have foundation that's kind of
how I got introduced to it but I find
this works really nicely for applying
like my moisturizers and my primers
which is what I use them for obviously
not your number one tool that you can
use is your fingers to use a primer and
moisturizer 100% go ahead and use your
fingers but for me I like anything with
like a duo fiber kind of top and it's
really like fluffy as well I just love
it to blending in like I said my primers
and stuff too so it's all kind of
pressured and like absorbed into my skin
I hope this helps create an even layer I
would definitely use it for foundation
as well anything with sort of creams I
love this but yeah the Real Techniques
multi-task brush I love love love it for
applying my primers as you guys know I
use it literally in every video and if
I'm a tool or brush I'm going to talk
about is a Beauty Blender I feel like
everyone should have a Beauty Blender
you can do this via primers you could
use this a foundation you can use this
for blending out concealer you can use
it
power you can use this could use this
and literally apply anything I recently
went to a beauty blender launch dinner
because they come up with a new one
that's kind of like pink and white and a
swirly one which is really really cool
yeah it is actually you can do your
whole makeup look with a Beauty Blender
because if you wear cream eyeshadows you
could dip it in and apply it to lids you
know it's got a small tapered end I just
feel like these are incredible
they do recommend that you use it damp
with a manual you can blend it into the
skin a lot better I've got to leave that
everyone the best friend I always use it
to kind of touch up with as well I feel
like this in 100 percent a must-have and
there's been so many dupes of damage I
do feel good but you can't be an
original Beauty Blender okay the next
question I'm going to talk about is a
duo fiber brush these are so good again
for all sorts of cream products I use
these to kind of apply it foundation I
made me kind of using to blend out a
cream contour again you could use this
to apply a primer of out concealer I
just feel like with the duo fiber
brushes they're incredible with creams
and this is a really nice sized one to
kind of get like precise application
maybe not necessarily a hundred percent
a must-have but I do find like I always
am using receive this one in particular
is a Mac one three and zero brush but
there are so many companies that do to
put more affordable versions but yeah I
just like the short bristles I think
they're really good for cleansing out of
cream contour cuz sometimes I find with
a Beauty Blender it could just kind of
take away the color this I find gives a
really effortless blend so I love a
little kind of duo fiber brush like this
okay I feel like this kind like a og
brush back in the day I watched Jackson
Hills makeup tutorials all the time she
was obsessed with a sigma f80 kabuki
brush i bleaching every time i read out
this brush i read it in her voice if you
like a full-coverage flawless foundation
look use stippling it dis onto your skin
really creates that finish I feel like
again it's with the flat top it kind of
is a bit bigger than the other one I
just use and a lot more dense
therefore it like prices a lot more
product into your skin creates such a
flawless finish if I want my extra
coverage in an area I 100% go in with a
flat top brush like this like I said
this one is just the Sigma f80 one I
rest and links to all these brushes and
a name standout like you guys to check
out that if it's Jackson Hale approved
in her full coverage of foundation
routine you know that you need it and I
love it as well so hopefully that's
enough okay the next two brushes are for
powder and if I get so many questions
about this specific brush whatever I use
in my videos this one is from a blank
canvas cosmetics it is their s15 brush
it's basically just a really small table
fluffy brush I love using distant like
pressed powder lightly underneath my
eyes and like buff powder all around my
face then the other powder brush that I
really love to use is something a bit
bigger again where the tape is finished
this is the Sigma tapered face f25 brush
you can see they're both of like a
similar size just mine is bigger than
the other so if you're maybe not
necessarily into precise part of
placement a bigger one would cover more
surface area quick a few so this one it
might be better I do like this for
applying more like an iridescent powder
underneath the eyes or like wiping stuff
away and then this one I like carry
around with me everywhere and it's
really good for product placement
they're both super fluffy and I feel
like neither some reassured so much on
my face so these are like my to go to
palette brushes and yet you guys always
ask me about this I mean this because
the bristles are red but it is from a
blank canvas cosmetics so for bronzer I
like to be quite precise with my bronzer
I don't want to have like a whole like
orange face on one side and I go to a
bronzer brush is from a zoeva is the
luxe cheek finish is the 1 to 6 brush I
loved it I feel like is the perfect size
just kind of get into the cheekbones but
still big enough to be able to bust and
blend I love this I can just dust it all
around
another bronzer brush with like the
shape like this again I feel like it
just fits perfectly on your face and
this is a nice size too I can always
like pop this my bag into take it
everywhere with me I feel like a lot of
speed brushes that I'm going to be
saying are from similar sort of brands
there's a lot of Sigma it's a waiver Mac
all sorts and I know especially for
Sigma and so ever they come in amazing
brush set so I definitely recommend
maybe checking out the brush it's that
these are involved in to get like the
most out of your money so I think I got
this on in the brush I bought it for
Christmas and actually I've been
obsessed and I use it everyday
ever since the next brush I mean be
jeweled map is for Russia now this one
is from a blank canvas cosmetics and is
s 0 full brush this one for me is just
super
fluffy I know you can see that it like
really just someone passing that's a
massive blush aware or doesn't like too
much blusher something like this is
really nice because it's so fluffy you
can get other ones whoops listen this is
a Mac one and it's like I don't know
it's just a bit harder which again will
pick up more product but then place more
product in your face a lot more like
prominent leaf if that makes sense with
my fine is just so so so fluffy but
again just because I'm naming this
specific brand and brush there will be
so many other brands that do a similar
sort of rush maybe some definitely form
or whatever but it's more like the sheep
and like the quality that I'm loving and
I get that quality from this one and
it's like it's a different time with
cosmetics it's lessening to it down
below but it's that classic angled blush
contour brush a lot of people I
literally just watch Hannah's current
must house video and she loves these
kind of brushes of foundation and when I
used to work at Mac there was a woman
that used this brush or like works in
the Mac version of this brush against
the foundation so there's no rules with
with brushes and what you can use them
for but I personally like this one for
blusher can't look like this rationing
on probably but moving on you guys know
I love a shimmery a bronzer and I just
love to dust it all around my face and
you probably always see me using this
brush this is a mac 135 brush it's
literally just a massive fluffy brush
now you could totally use this video
bronzer you could use this the old
foundation if you want to paint like not
paint on but like apply a lot I just
like to just like powder products into
this again like shimmery bronzer or an
illusionary bronzer just really lightly
dust it everywhere just because it
covers a lot of surface area quite
quickly I know
morphe do a similar shape to this brush
which would probably be a fraction of
the price but again Mac brushes are
really an incredible quality which is
lower this one's not staying at multi
art I just passed and haven't tried that
one so I don't want to hundreds don't
recommend getting that one instead of
this one because I'm not trying it I
just know I've seen it but I just love a
big brush like this you could totally
some face powder as well I just think a
big fluffy brush should be in like
everyone's collection you can just use
whatever you want for it whether it's
like all over your body or whatever I
just I really like this one so this is
the mac 135 that I personally use to
just like creating a
Oh on my face and these final two
brushes I'm going to talk about for like
a face section is for highlighting now
mine are both really small I don't
personally reach for a fan brush or
anything like that when it comes to
highlighting because I like to be quite
precise and I feel like these just blend
and have such incredible application so
this one is a morphe m5 double one I'm
probably the only person that doesn't
have a multi coat like that you want to
get this brush you can use curved a
little bit for money off but I don't
have a coated down so um as you want I
know you can just get these on beautybay
anyway which is why I've left a link to
down below listen if the m5 one one is
basically I think it's actually meant
for your eye it's like a really big
fluffy brush but I loved it for like a
base highlight where I love that kind of
color to show through more so I use this
for more powerful highlighting as in
like press powder highlighting I just
feel like you can get such a precise
application whether it blends so so so
nicely onto the skin I love this I would
also actually use this for concealer to
buff out like if I have another one I
would use that for that but yeah I love
this brush for highlighting and I'm sure
you guys know I've always read about
this brush for highlighting as well it
is a Mac two to four this is actually
again incredible as a fluffy crease
brush as in like in your eye I love this
for highlighting but specifically love
this for like we use powder highlighters
I pick them up with a brush because it
is super precise give it a little bit
spritz and just buff it in the bristles
of these are quite action they're quite
fun compared to the other ones that they
really really blend into the skin which
is what I love about this for
highlighting so my highlighter just kind
of looks effortlessly it placed onto the
skin so I'm sure you guys know this is
coming but yeah I love a Mac two to four
for highlighting but now move on to eye
brushes I am excessive with eye brushes
I really lacks like narrow this down and
foot look if you just want to create a
glam look like what I've on or just kind
of have enough brushes to be able to do
everything I'm going to really cut it
down here's the basics so here we go I
feel like to create any eye look you
need a big black not necessarily black
where are we going with that a big
initial fluffy brush for your transition
color this is a sigma e40 I must read
about these like everyone raised about
these Sigma do incredible eye brushes
and this one
such a go to it literally is what I use
back then for my initial transition
color I always use it as almost like a
blending a razor I always won this is
another color down go back in with this
brush please another color down go back
in with this brush you know I mean so
I'm literally in love with that Sigma
e-40 check it the next brush I'm going
to talk about is a slightly smaller
fluffy brush this is a is over two to
seven I'll just show you the shape of
this it's almost similar to a Mac two
one seven if that kind of shade I feel
like so many brands do a brush like this
and I feel like everyone needs one is
just a slightly smaller and more precise
fluffy brush to get kind of further and
deeper into your crease you could
probably use this as your initial
transition kind of I'm just super super
fussy I love to kind of mix between them
both I feel like it's such a great shape
for all eyes and when you're using loads
of colors it is good to kind of mix it
up with brushes I feel like they brought
the tools that you use kind of affect
how your eyes look if you're being very
like restricted with the amount of tools
that you use and you're thinking why
isn't it looking as great it might just
be just even on this left brush you know
just like applying when it comes to
applying shadows but yet those kind of
to a necessity shapes to be able to
create the looks that I do so these are
two that I recommend and like I said
this is from silver and it's a two to
seven come I'm OCD and I like need loads
of brushes but I'm just going to
throwing shapes and sizes out there for
you so you guys can see for yourself I
do like to use another fluffy brush this
time feeds to a slightly smaller both
are from zueva I pray to probably get
all of these in a set somewhere but this
is the two or three one and this is the
Tooting for the two three one is called
a luxe petit crease and the two two four
is called a luxe defined crease I'm
going to hold them up so you can see it
so the one on the Left which is this one
has slightly less precision but it's
just kind of more fluffy again I love
this is just like an eraser like an ayah
razor buff I feel like you can be quite
precise with it and then it has that
fluffy ability to be able to blend it
out and then this one has more of like a
it's almost a good giant pencil brush
like all the bristles are really firm in
place so you can get incredible like
definition and like precise application
with it but again it's still a fluffy
crease brush so you can buff it out so I
really love these ones going like a full
blown smoky eye I want it to be a
blended through the voice which is you
know
a lot of the time I love kind of going
that extra mile with a little brush like
this to make sure I'm getting precise
application and everything is blended
seamlessly
now the next brush I love is a Mac two
for two you could use this for anything
you can use to apply your cream
eyeshadow base I like to use these to
apply glitters again cream eyeshadows or
any kind of like the lid shape that you
need to pack on this is my favorite
brush for packing things on everyone I
work with like this - gingy brush and
honestly is a go-to I love this again
for creams powder anything on the eye
packing it on I love this brush I can't
really but enough has never found a kind
of cheaper alternative so I really love
this again the mat - 4 - 2 - 2 - 4 - I
think it's a month - 4 - so you're
struggling with like cream shadows or
that kind of stuff can't find a brush to
do it the bristles on this make it so
easy to blend so easy to apply so and
this is like a must-have for more kind
of precise shadow application I always
like to reach this brush if I'm doing a
halo I adjust like a small shader to
pack on a color this is a Mac - to a
it's literally just a weeny weeny tiny
shader brush you can also use this to
apply any inner corner color or like
buffing out any kind of shout out on
your lower lashline it's basically just
a really really Diggy brush to be able
to do whatever you want there to apply
some like brow bone highlight with it as
well
I just feel like anyone needs a very
small shader brush like a big animal to
be able to create like the flawless eye
look maybe if you just pick between one
but I really loved it I use it for like
loose shadows as well these are plies
foiled shadows really nicely yeah I just
love this one for applying any sort of
lid color and the final brush I'm going
to talk about is a pencil brush these
are so good for applying minimal things
so again in a corner highlighter I
always use a pencil brush like this to
apply my lower lash line shallow if I
put anything on my top lash line I want
to buff it out again this is such an
amazing precise brush to be able to do
that with I kind of use about two or
three of them in one go once like inner
corner highlight one for shadow
underneath and that kind of stuff so
maybe get a couple of these of the thing
you're getting a pencil brush but I feel
like everyone needs a pencil brush it
can do obviously whatever you want may
need to do like no time
and all that kind of stuff is just yet a
very good small precise brush to be able
to do kind of little details with but
that is it I feel like that is kind of
my like really condensed recommendations
of brushes shapes and like the sizes and
all that kind of stuff that I use to
create my everyday makeup I've left the
links to them all down below and you can
find cheap alternatives or like once I
