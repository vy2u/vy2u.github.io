look slightly wet I think tan my face
last night so I kind to be quick because
there a rumor mailer coming in a minute
because today my flat is literally being
completely packed up we are moving to a
new flat I'm literally moving across so
the removal men are coming just to pack
everything up today and then tomorrow
they're gonna be moving at all so there
should be a chance for me to show you an
empty flat tour of this one and my new
one but I thought I would just show you
what my flat looks like now in case
you've never seen it hello by the way I
don't know if I actually introduced you
to the moving vlog so yeah they're gonna
be here soon I've got to take the pins
out and stuff so I kinda need to be
quick but let me just show you like my
flat as it is now so this is just like
their entrance this is my bedroom this
is like my wardrobe the ensuite and then
you come through makeup filming room
another bathroom and this is just like
the lounge area so it's all pretty like
full right now and then obviously it's
all literally about to be emptied
literally it's me my sideburns this
morning how it is I'm gonna quickly pop
some like eyebrows on and take the pins
out and then I'm guessing they'll be
here which would be exciting and the
process will begin
so guys it is all done I guess I can now
show you kind of like my pack duck slap
obviously not everything is weight not
everything everything is completely
packed up because some things can't be
packed up and we just move them all over
as one so that will all be happening
tomorrow so I'll show you my flat all
packed up and then actually I think I'm
gonna pop over to my new flat because
obviously if all my furniture is moving
in tomorrow I'm not gonna get to show
you it empty and they really want to
show you what it's like empty so I'll go
ahead and total on over to my new flat
to be able to show you that yeah now
time to show you what the incredible
it's a removals company called gentle
giants and the guy was so lovely if
you're in the sorry area or actually
ideal they do like London as well
honestly they just come in pack up
everything and yeah you're not really
disturbed but he was super nice so now
yeah I'll just show you my packed up
flat and then the next thing I gas will
be to show you my new empty flat so I
think you'll see that they're actually
really similar just a little bit bigger
so you can see this is like the biggest
pack up like all my products are now
gone my bedroom is just filled with
boxes and stuff all my clothes pretty
much all packed
we just got gonna get one more wardrobe
of that in for tomorrow my makeup room
is all packed up as well and my kitchen
is pretty much all packed up too so now
I guess I have to show you well I want
to show you what my new flat looks like
so I'll do like a trippy thing so this
is the entrance to my old flat and here
is the entrance to my new flat and this
is the entrance to my new fatso bevor
different layout so in here we have the
classic utilities cover but this one is
so much bigger and it has so much more
space to store like my shoes and
everything like as that you come around
the corner
and this is the master bathroom
so this from around this master bathroom
just
a shower like toilet sink like my own
sweet did and the moss and the ensuite
in this one is the one with the bath so
this is gonna be my work room so as you
could see just an empty white room hope
I have my first package delivered here
the other day yeah just a big empty
washroom then you come through here to
the hallway this is another storage
cupboard and this one's just like
completely empty this one's just
completely empty so I don't know I'm
gonna in that it's just handy to have
and this is what my other flats mean
locked and then we've just got some like
you know drawers on a mirror there this
is just my bedroom got some fitted
fitted wardrobes in there with some
much-needed space and storage and then
we've got my ensuite with sunlight
really cool like in the wall storage
which is really good shower a little
dinky tub so cute yeah so that's my
bathroom and then it become Surrey and
it's got some double doors which I'm
like that's a swag and then we have the
kitchen and these are all windows down
here and yeah just a little a little
overview of my little pet that we've got
going on literally it is so bright and
air in here and also around the bay
windows it's about keeping I know I'm so
excited to all my stuff will come in
here to ride it she can't visualize
where it's all gonna go but you know
it's really similar to the flat I've got
now and this sense it's like a rounded
window and a rounded sitting room living
room that kind of thing so I'll be
excited to stop hang around with all the
furniture get my makeup in be able to
start filming again in like my new rooms
which I always motivates me to like
start filming again in this sense I'm in
a new environment which is always really
really fun so yeah that's kind of like
that empty flat and I guess the next
thing will be just to move everything
across and then I could show you the
finished flat it's not like completely
finished when I move everything across
Booker's just because something work
old flat doesn't necessarily mean it's
gonna work in my new flat but for now
it'll do kind of thing so I'm sure I'll
be doing like a fully done flat tour at
some point but tomorrow would just be me
moving all my initial stuff in and just
so you can get a feel of the space more
it's like with all the furniture in it
which I'm so excited for paper love it
good morning guys it is Thursday morning
and it is officially moving day
more of an up sir everything is gone
only we let the big stuff slap look this
whole thing the sofas are in you're not
you don't quite a lot um stuff is coming
into my bedroom slowly but steadily God
all way make ups being transported
outside the most important thing but
there's not huge amount to show just
yeah or just literally anything up and
we're we valued at some progress with
unboxing all my makeup so I thought I
should probably be filming this and show
you me get to the rest of these boxes
God literally this is so tedious hey
guys so is now definitely a good few
hours later and I've pretty much
unpacked majority of what I can I mean
my makeup room still a little bit of a
mess as you can see but that's because
the unit that all my clothes hang in we
left all the tools at my old place I
still have the keys to my old place and
can still access it so and we need to
kind of get the tools for that so we
thought I'd just show you everything
that I've done and then definitely gonna
call it a night tonight just because
today has been long I'm sure you can
imagine like literally moving is one of
the most stressful things ever and it
takes so long so I thought I'd just show
you everything that I've done so you can
get a vibe for the place now so as I
said my makeup room still I'd like to go
but all of that and stuff it's just
stuff that needs to go on there so
that'd be so easily done once that's all
put together and I can't wait to start
filming and makeup tutorials and all
that good stuff again they're kind of
still clothes as well and come through
come through oh look I'm vibey my
bedroom is now yes an abscessed okay
thank you the lights on so this is my
bedroom now I'm definitely gonna hang my
pictures back up there I've got a lot of
my clothes in here now and I've got to
unpack all my bathroom stuff as well to
be fed that's gonna be another little
job to do and then unpacked literally my
drives the kitchen the sofas and I'm
putting all my stuff slowly but steadily
back in to these and that's pretty much
the pant so as I said I am a super duper
tired I haven't got my Wi-Fi sup yet so
I've managed to connect like an open B
cy5 managing to watch Gossip Girl it
just made me is so happy because
literally after say all I want to do is
put my feet up tomorrow I'll hopefully
get everything done everything will look
as it should be I'm sure there'll be a
few empty boxes lying around yeah the
next time you see me will be Friday
mourn
ready to continue this as a long process
guys I don't recommend doing it without
you know someone that knows what they're
doing okay and my mum she has literally
been the best mum if you're watching
this I love you so much and good night
morning everyone
oh my god it feels
so good to have like fixed hand and put
some makeup on which is exactly what
I've done it this morning I haven't
really done it to too much more unboxing
because I can't do anything until my
wardrobes been up because all the boxes
that are left just kind of filled with
codes that went in my makeup room which
is really annoying I thought maybe I'll
just I don't know whatever
I'll saved it this morning my room in
the light looking delightful oh yeah I
base all my products into the fitted
thing like who the hell needs this much
of stuff I don't know but I managed to
unpack all of that and yeah this is my
bedroom just gonna pop those boxes away
again it's kind of all still the same
old this I can't wait till this gets
assembled and I can hang all this stuff
up and then all the stuff in those boxes
has a place to go but right now it is a
Friday and my friend Chloe is about to
come around and see it for the first
time in person obviously I always said I
sent my friends like videos and stuff
when I was getting yet but yeah she's
gonna come back and see it and then
we're just gonna hang out and yeah my
dad might need to come round later
though because and there's a few things
that need doing like the showers a bit
funny just the way that I think it's
screwed on so I feel like he'll be able
to do that my TV doesn't work so
annoying there's like signal port for
the TV lips she like isn't working so I
told the landlady and I think she's
gonna come and help sort it yeah the
rest will just be trying to find a home
for everything but my friends coming
around first so yeah that's kinda like
my plans for the day
I'm hoping this vlog is going up Sunday
and I'm hoping they actually do
something interesting between now and
Sunday to show you guys I just couldn't
want to show you with it out any boxes
but I'm not sure that's gonna be
possible but fingers crossed
yay I'm so happy to have like makeup on
and stuff like the past few days we've
just barely been wearing any makeup
because one it's been packed away and -
like I've been doing so much kind of
like walking around and stuff that it
just kind of like falls off my face
anyway so I've had a bit of a skin break
but now it's back to the for glam and
it's Friday and I'm craving a glass of
wine and I'm pretty sure it's only like
12:30 so oops hey guys oh my god it's
now the evening time Richard I knew this
would happen I knew I wanted to do
Blagh but then i knew that wouldn't be a
huge amount that I can you know vlog and
tons of just like moving and then
showing you and then I knew there was
gonna be boxes for a few days oh god
getting a better life there so really
sorry about that but is now it's
obviously Friday like you said earlier
and I'm going out on my god I'm so
excited to go out I haven't been out in
like so long because I've been preparing
for this move and all sorts but I
thought I would just show you my face
and everything like that I definitely
gonna need to be doing some makeup
tutorials ASAP I can't wait for my
makeup room to be unboxed yeah my friend
is coming to pick me up because she
lives where I love now which is really
fun so she's going to pick me up and
then we're going and then tomorrow yeah
this could be the end of the vlog if it
is I'll say bye now and I'm sorry it was
kind of like but at least you get to see
where I live now and the process and all
that kind of good stuff yeah I will see
you guys tomorrow bye

just peeled off this one this is in the
color dark brown and then I'm gonna pull

tutorial so you would have seen the
packs I used on that this is basically
what I had on my face last night before

weather is so crap today but I'm just
gonna make myself some lunch and then I
have to go back to my other flat and

back because then later on like I said I
think earlier I've got to assemble that
furniture and then these boxes are
