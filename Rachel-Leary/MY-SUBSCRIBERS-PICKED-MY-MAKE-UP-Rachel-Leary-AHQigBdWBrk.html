today is another kind of challenge type
video it is you guys get to pick my
makeup so I asked you guys on Twitter to
tweet me products you wanted me to use
so all the products chosen have been
chosen by you guys and I'm gonna insert
the tweets where I got them from at so
look out for a little let's shout out if
you think I may have picked your item
speaking of shout outs we also do a
notification bell a shout outs on this
channel you don't know what that is
it's just letting me know in the comment
section down below when you've hit that
notification bow and I pick a random up
comment to show little love to because
you guys are giving me the love by doing
that so this week it goes to Tanya can
who says notification bell on your
amazing no you are amazing thank you
guys so much for the love on my previous
video if you haven't already seen it I
will leave it there it is I tried
following a makeup challenge and let me
tell you it was a funny one
without further ado if you want to see
the makeup of products I use it to
create this kind of soft glam look with
a berry lip there's some new products in
there from that kind of Stasi Beverly
Hills testing some overly hyped products
as well that you guys wanted to see just
to see if they are worth the hype so
without further ado let's get started
okay so I'm gonna start with the skin so
I only really saw like one or two tweets
for a primer and they were ones that I
didn't have and I didn't have the time
to go out and get anything so I kinda
had to make use of everything that I had
here but someone did tweet me saying
anything too fast so I thought I would
go ahead and use an old favorite this is
the two-faced hang of the X primer and
is literally or one of my favorite
primers ever what hold on luckily your
girl has a spare always have backups of
my favorite stuff but as I was saying I
love this primer so much it's the
perfect combination of like a really
stir izing primer but also a part that
works really well so it feels super
comfortable on my skin it's kind of
meant to make you feel a little more
alive hydrated but also make your makeup
last a long time which is exactly what
we want so even though none of you said
that exact primer I love Too Faced as a
brand anyway so any excuse to use
anything to your face okay next up I saw
a couple of tweets to use this I did see
loads of tweets to say using the new
L'Oreal a foundation stick to the makeup
revolution foundation sticks I plan to
get my hands on them very soon so I'll
be able to like a comparison video maybe
or a video of them within themselves I
did see a couple of people saying the
ex1 that foundation because you wanted
to see if it was worth the hype and I
also actually really loved this so again
I'm so glad that you guys wanted to kind
of like see this in use and to apply I'm
actually gonna be using this sponge and
it's from a Maybelline but it's so good
I'm not even joking so I didn't even
know Maybelline did sponges and I don't
have that out in the UK yeah I got this
NARS in the US and it literally it's the
best thing ever
yeah I'm just gonna apply the foundation
to my skin I think that it's a really
nice kind of like satin finish and I
definitely say it's a medium coverage
you could definitely build this up and
also share it out I feel I'm using the
shade six right now this to me is like a
everyday foundation because it's a super
gorgeous like natural finish and it's
not really heavy on the skin I think
they kind of take pride in this
foundation kind of looking like your
skin but better and I definitely
with that but if you're in the market
for like a new everyday kind of medium
coverage foundation is like a
natural-looking finished I definitely
would recommend that one and you can now
get the boots which is so much more
easily accessible and I've left a link
to that and also everything else down
below I only saw one request for
concealer and it was a good one it was
the make up a revolution conceal and
define I'm gonna use the shade c5 for
this I still can't get over how amazing
this concealer is I barely need any of
it on my brush and it applies so much to
my face
the coverage is insane and I literally
can't believe this is only four pounds
so I'm just gonna be applying that
everywhere that usually weren't and i'm
using the maybelline sponge again just
the other side to blend that in and I
always like to kind of take up onto my
lid to act as a primer as well like I
said you guys still haven't tried this
yet it's definitely worth picking up I
have it in the shades c5 which is kind
of like a everyday color in the sense
that it's just like a little bit lights
that my skin tone but it's still light
enough to brighten but nothing too
drastic I also have it in the shade c2
which is obviously really light so I use
that it's like my brightening shade and
if I want like a really bright under eye
and I also have it in the shade c7 which
is kind of more that matches my skin
tone concealer color so sometimes I'll
use like c7 with c2 on the top or like
I'm doing now I'll just use c5 on its
own I love the combination of those two
together cause like I said the
foundation is a little bit more on the
natural coverage side but that concealer
is definitely more on the medium to full
coverage size so it's nice to have like
a more natural coverage face and then in
the areas that I particularly need it
which is my under eyes I've got that
fuller coverage so so to set it all in
place that somebody asked me to use the
RCM a translucent powder I'm so glad you
guys requested me to use this because I
haven't used it in absolutely ages I
love this powder it looks really really
good in pictures however I hate that
there's like nowhere to dispense the
powder which is so annoying so I kind of
have to take the lid off or like just
disperse like a little bit onto like a
flat sir
this which looks particularly dodgy then
just take my brush and set it all in
place I haven't used this in ages it
used to be like my go to powder but then
so many brands came out with like
amazing powders came out with amazing
powders like the Mack Patrick Starr one
the two-faced definitely came out with a
good a few good ones and this powder
wasn't so as easily accessible but then
there was such a hyper built around it
that I think a beauty baked on it I've
definitely linked it down below and I
think it is on the BG base site that
I've linked it so really easy to get I
thought I'd just assume you in quickly
and show you what the skin looks like
I'm obsessed everything is just like all
it's set in place I look dead but it
doesn't feel heavy on my skin at all
I love the combination of that
foundation and concealer together it
kind of gives me the perfect mix of what
I'm after and you know that powders
really looked everything in place so I
thought I would just zoom in and show
you that now I am gonna do eyebrows
there wasn't a huge request for eyebrow
products but the one that did come up
was the anastasia beverly hills dipbrow
but i thought i would play on that
anything to face to tweet as well and I
completely forgot I had this it's the
Too Faced chocolate brow knee pencil in
the color soft brown and you guys know I
like to kind of have a lighter color
through the front so I'm going to use
the dip brow from Anastacio in a dark
brown through the tail of my brow and
then the Too Faced brow me I pencil in
soft brown through the front to kind of
create that ombre effect okay we are
back and brows are done I figured you
guys know how to use a deep brown you've
seen me use it hundreds of times before
and I've used and I always link my brow
routine and the description down below
the brow pencil is more of like a brow
definer and like I always do I just kind
of fell at it through the front but I
really like the way those two go
together and I was a bit cautious of the
color being soft brown there's gonna be
too light but I feel like they blend
really nicely together but now we can
continue on with the face oh okay so for
bronzing and contouring somebody asked
me to use a new face of bronze that this
is their milk chocolate Soleil bronzer I
love this and I love how yummy the Too
Faced stuff always smells it gets me so
excited to use erm not even joking there
chocolate range every
thing is literally infused with like a
chocolaty vanilla smell and I love the
blend ability of these bronzes and they
definitely have loads of shades of these
I feel like that's just warmed up the
complexion nicely your jaw and chin area
yes I love that and I feel like I need
to kind of just bronze up everywhere and
for glad somebody asked to use the
Maybelline blush I'm gonna take it their
master crime at blush and I'm gonna take
this one here you guys know I'm a big
fan of this blutter kit already I think
this is a really good item to have if
you're like a pro at make a parson you
need something for your kit because it
has loads of different shades you can
use them as eyeshadows everything so I'm
just gonna apply but just kind of softly
here I'm kind of inspired by the whole
it's soft glam Anastasio palette vibe
and it's gonna be quite a soft glam look
but the pigment of these is really
really pretty and I'm waiting for the
day that Maybelline bring out like
individual blushes or if they already do
let me know in the comment section
because I've never seen them I tried to
search for them online as well and I
couldn't see them anywhere and to finish
off the skin for highlight I'm gonna
take the anastacio Beverly Hills and
amrezy highlighter which is now
available on the UK Anastasio Beverly
Hills website so I've linked it down
below as well as the soft round part
that we're gonna use so I cannot wait to
see you guys glowing because this is
honestly and saying I'm so glad that you
asked me to use this like oh my god I
feel like I say this about all
highlighters that I use but this one is
I impressive yes honey we is gonna be
glowing today just highlighting all the
places that I usually would I could
literally just keep applying that's ages
I'm like scared for the day that this
runs out if you haven't had the
opportunity to get your hands on it yeah
definitely do it is so gorgeous if this
doesn't like show it to you then I don't
know it will that's bomb.com yeah okay
so that is the skin finished I am so
happy with the way that it's come out
and like the choice of products and the
way that is looking in general so now
we're gonna move on to the eyes and
we've got some exciting new stuff to do
to the eyes
let's go ahead and do that now okay so
for the eyes today a couple of you asked
me to use the new anastasi out Beverly
Hills soft glam eyeshadow palette which
I'm so excited for it is so gorgeous I'm
only gonna be using this for the crease
colors today because someone asked me to
use something else for the lid which I
have wanted to use for a while so I'm
excited to use that so from this palette
I'm gonna take the shade orange soda as
our initial transition color I'm just
gonna blend blend and build such a
gorgeous color I'm just gonna make my
way through the dark
crease color so now I'm gonna take the
shade burnt orange build that up into
the crease I don't want anything too
heavy on the eyes today because we're
gonna keep it kind of rose gold these
soft glam vibe looks cuz we're gonna go
for a slightly darker lip option so we
don't want any attention to like be
taken away from that I always like to
like press and then blend you guys know
the drill just getting progressively
deeper I'm just gonna take the color
actually rustic and Sienna mixed
together and they're gonna be the kind
of to a final crease colors that we use
just packing but that's all we're gonna
do it for the crease colors onto the lid
somebody asked me to use the newest deal
at magnificent metals shimmer and glow
eye shadow I love their glittering glow
eyeshadows but this one is a lot more of
a metallic finish and if you kind of
like looks like this but you don't have
the time to sit down and I wet pigments
and all that kind of stuff these are the
best things ever I when I went to the
launch of these I was telling them that
these are like my go-to if I need a
quick smoky eye to look pretty really
pretty they just glide on really
pigmented fast time super quick they dry
super-quick they're like I said super
pigmented so this is in the color
Jezebel and it's like a gorgeous rose
gold so I thought perfect with this
palette and literally just paint it on
same on this side
literally obsessed like I said I love
these and what I love about these also
is that they do amazing everyday neutral
colors like this but then they also have
those pops of colors I think there's a
really really gorgeous olive green like
a turquoise II purple kind of color so
if you like more of the colorful
when you're doing things like this then
they definitely have an option for that
as well and that is kind of the eye
shadow complete so for the next step I
thought I would assume you in a little
bit more because otherwise had product
to test and try was the benefit gal bang
mascara to see if this is also worth the
hype I'm sure you saw everyone on that
trip for the launch of this and
literally was so hyped up so I
understand the inquiry so the wand looks
like this it's what am i kind of
preferred ones the bristles are kind of
like hard and firm so you can really
separate and elongate them and create a
it's separated yet dramatic eyelash so
let's go ahead and apply so I'm just
kind of rolling the brush into my lashes
but that is what my lashes look like
with it but my first kind of coating so
they look super separated and lengthened
but still pack a punch I almost like
don't need falsies but we know I'm gonna
be applying falsies so the brush did
make it easy to get the bottom lashes
which I really really like and really
kind of gripped them and combed them
because it does pick up a lot of product
though I have kind of got some
underneath my eye but that will come off
in like two seconds with an earbud but
that's the difference as you can see so
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other eye
and then yeah like I said I will show
you the lashes so these are the finished
eyes with just mascara on I could
probably just leave it like that but you
guys requested me to use the tacky
lashes that I got in the other day I
love this brand of eyelashes I love the
packaging for one and if you follow
murmur murmur Mitchell on Instagram he
uses these in literally all of his looks
I'm obsessed with how fluttery these
ones are these are the TL for style
they're my favorite style out then I
fill in like nikkietutorials and James
Charles also rave about these so I'm
gonna go ahead and apply these now so
these are the finished eyes with lashes
you guys pick the best stuff I swear you
guys just must know me but like I said
these lashes are some of my faves said
the tattoo dashes in the style tr4 I've
left them at linked down below they're
just so fluttery that entry still too
much attention away from the eye almost
like a perfect everyday yet dramatic
eyelash with you into that kind of thing
but you definitely could have worn this
I was that mascara on its own so now all
there's left to do is the
I was gonna do a classic nude because
you guys asked me to use a buxom plump
line and also a maybelline superstay map
in clip stick and I definitely do have
some favorite nudes from them like the
stealth box and plump line the Engel
neato plump line and the driver
maybelline superstay matte liquid lip
used them a lot so I thought I would mix
up the color and go with this cute kind
of berry combo so I'm gonna take the
color lover from Maybelline but first of
all line my lips with a Dahlia danger
from a buxom yet said that is the lips
line I'm loving that color it was called
dolly danger and it's such a gorgeous
berry color but now for the main event
it is the Maybelline liquid lipstick in
lover which is again a really gorgeous
very nude oh my god literally a perfect
match
these Maybelline liquid lipsticks
literally a do not budge such a
comfortable formula as well I've been
loving a driver at the moment which is
their like pale nude color you guys
haven't definitely checked them out okay
we are nearly finished is just be a
final step somebody asked me to use the
maybelline superstay makeup setting
spray their whole superstay range it's
been really impressive so far I love the
primer foundation the liquid lipsticks
I'm they've already impressed me so
let's see it's super like hydrating so
until let that dry dry thought I draw
draw draw but now this is the finished
makeup look so this is dia finished
makeup lick all chosen by you guys so I
really hope you guys liked it if you did
