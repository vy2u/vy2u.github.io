today I decided to do a video on how to
kind of enhance the color of your eyes
if your eyes are like blue or green like
mine and this eye shadow look is going
to look really nice on all different eye
types but because it's so warm it's just
going to really bring out the color of
blue eyes and green eyes because orange
and blue are kind of complementary
colors so it's just kind of Mentor
enhance the tones in your eyes and just
make them really stand out and you can
pair this with a nude lip or any kind of
color lip I decided to stick with the
warm theme and go with kind of a really
nice warm coral color parrot with
anything that you want to I know I say
this in like every video I feel really
bad the 10,000 subscriber belated
giveaway is coming I'm waiting on two
more things to arrive in the post and

you kind of like my new background and
setup and stuff I'm kind of changing it
around a bit and being a bit more
professional yeah you like it and please
keep watching let's get started what my
so to start off I'm going to be priming
my I using my Mac soft ochre paint or
and this jumbo pencil from la color in
the color relaxation I think it is and
I'm applying stopped at the paint
brought to the other part of my lid and
the pencil to the main body of my lid
this is because we're going to be using
lots of warm shades so the warmth tone
and this is gonna really bring out the
color next I'm taking caramel and Sienna
from the mania Anastasia Beverly Hills
palette and using that camera on a sigma
e40 brush at the initial transition
shade and then using piano to further
deepen the crease
next I'm taking max melon pignon and Max
reflex from I'm at placing the map melon
pigment on first using a sigma e55 brush
just pressing that onto the lid and then
using the same brush pressing the
glitter over the top just to add that
extra gun
sparkly lid then going back in with the
Sienna shade just a further deepen the
crease and hope you love any definition
from placing the glitter on the lid then
using the shade chocolate from the
anastasia beverly hills tomorrow palette
which is just a really nice warm dark
brown and just placing that into the
crease on a pencil brush to add further
definition for skin eyes Laura Mercier
foundation primer and the NARS all day
luminous foundation in stromboli the
brows I used to Anastasia Beverly Hills
brow Wiz in medium brown tip brow in
chocolate and the skinny brow in light
medium and to contour and highlight I
use the annotation beverages food
control pill in light and settle in
places Mac light mineralized skinfinish
natural and my Max Delphic stronger
then went ahead and applied the same la
color eyeliner in my waterline just to
really bring out the blueness or it's
got green eyes the greenness in the eyes
and then applied Sienna on the lower
lash line to smoke out the eye line
under the pencil brush and then I had a
tiny bit of caramel underneath that with
a fluffy brush
I didn't want to do any eyeliner with
this look so I just went ahead and
applied mascara and you can leave it as
that but as always I'm going to be
applying some of all slashes that have
an invisible lash band as I said before
that there is no eyeliner with this clip
then on to the lips I've decided to
stick with the warm cream you can apply
any kind of lips that you want this eye
look is really neutral and this is
Anastasia Beverly Hills electric Kohl
