channel so today I'm joined with huh
sorry weird hand you guys always ask us
to do beers together we asked you guys
on Twitter what you wanted to see and
literally weigh over half of whoever
voted said that they wanted to see us do
each other's makeup so on my channel
you're going to see me doing Hannah's
makeup because we thought that'd just be
easier and then on her channel I will
leave the link for it down below and the
video she does my makeup yeah so
obviously if you want to see this look
after this video head over to Hannah's
motion watch it burn I mean so head over
to have this channel to watch that one
but yeah if you want to see this makeup
look and the one that you saw in the
introduction then please keep watching
thanks so much for doing makeup I'm a
little bit something I'm not sure what
I'm gonna what she said
okay let's get started so I am going to
moisturize her skin first using this
Body Shop vitamin C a moisturizer and
just buffing that in with a brush I feel
like when you're doing makeup on other
people it's either good to use a brush
even though I know I use on myself or
just to ask their permission to use your
hands some people really is don't like
it but we are going to start with the
eyes first and I'm going to take Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and just above that
all over Hannah's eyelids like so this
was her favorite primer and I was trying
to use some of her favorite products as
you guys already know so yet just
buffing that all over the lid and then
setting that in place with a powder just
to make sure that when I'm going in with
other powder shadows it doesn't cling to
any creams and it makes it a lot easier
to blend we are going to be using all
makeup geek eyeshadows today just
because that was the palette that I
brought with me so that's kind of all
but I had and this is I think purely
naked and I'm just buffing that into her
crease lifting up her eyebrows slightly
so the skin is tightened and I can
really see where her crease is and using
my Mac 2 to a 4 brush to do so to
further deepen up the crease I'm going
to take Coco bear also from makeup geek
I have listed everything that I've used
down below guys so if you wanted to
recreate it you can do and I'm using a
slightly smaller fluffy brush this is
the Mac 2 to 4 and I'm always just
pressing this into the kind of outer
part of her eye but then buffing it up
into her crease I find pressing shadows
gives you the pigmentation and then
using that kind of windscreen wiper
motion diffuses the two colors together
Hannah will tell you I was like the
blend I'm when it comes to makeup on
other people I will honestly continue to
blend for about two days because I am
such a perfectionist when it comes to
stuff like that because I know I want to
do the makeup on someone else how I want
it to look on myself now I am taking a
bitten so a slightly up brown shade also
from makeup geek and I'm using an even
smaller fluffy brush and again
concentrating this slightly further to
create that gradient and then buffing it
back into the crease always going back
in with my original a fluffy brush to
make sure everything is really diffused
together
I think bitten and like purple
undertones really complimented Hannah's
eyes because I'm the eyes are of like
that bluey green kind of color and
anything with kind of green purple
really brings them out then
can see yep going back in with the two
T's to fought to make sure that I am
happy with that blend then I'm using the
soft ochre Paint Pot again and I'm using
this to kind of carve out her crease get
rid of any of the shade like any of the
crease color set of may have transferred
onto her lid and then this also gives me
a really good base because I was going
to go in with a loose pigment and loose
pigments work better when they're
slightly dampened or they're clinging to
something wet so using a base like this
this is why you kind of see this all
over Instagram because when people use
shadows or pigments using something like
this underneath really it makes them
stand out the pigment I'm using is this
one from neve cosmetics this was I think
the first time Hannah's usually of
cosmetics pigment you guys know I rave
about these so much and this was like a
champagne e color but it had a purple
undertone so I specifically brought it
with me because I knew I wanted to use
on Hannah to compliment her eyes and
then using a fluffy brush again to kind
of go back in and diffuse the crease
colors with the lid shade let me see
when I was editing this the amount I
just went back and forth between brushes
I think I have like a OCD problem when
it comes to makeup but I wanted to make
sure that it looked the best that it
could and yet so you can see sometimes
where you put the cream the line can be
quite harsh so I was using a pencil
brush as well to kind of really diffuse
them all together and then just touching
up as I saw fit then using the
Cinderella reflex pearl it's not
necessarily just from Cinderella they do
do it permanently but I'm not sure how
easy it is to get hold of what I like to
do especially on other people is to
spray their eye first with fix+ make
sure they keep their eyes shut this
whole time because we don't want it to
transfer then I also spray my brush with
fix+ as well after applying the glitter
and then it press it on the top then I'm
going in with this makeup geek eyeshadow
this is maca so just a really dark brown
concentrating this on the furthest kind
of part of the eye to really create that
gradient effect and then going back in
with previous fluffy brushes that I've
used I never really pick up any
additional product it is just to kind of
diffuse the colors together as you guys
know that's my favorite technique to do
and then finally as the last kind of
transition color I know so many
eyeshadows you don't obviously have to
do this far but we were doing an
ultimate glam look today and I always
feel like a little bit of black goes a
long way then I'm highlighting her in a
corner with shimmer shimmer from makeup
geek just using a pencil brush hannah
has the most amazing like inner corners
to highlight I find it so difficult to
do it on myself so has worked so much
easier and then I applied some under her
brows as well now my favorite part I am
just using a wipe to clean up the edge
and create that winged effect I find it
easier when doing on other people to
kind of tighten the skin and then drag
the wipe across then eyeliner on
somebody else as you can see it was
quite hard to explain what I'm doing but
I never make people that I do makeup on
to shut their eyes while doing eyeliner
I always make they then keep their eyes
open I go across the lid first and then
tidy it up with a wipe afterwards I feel
like going across the lid first as well
gives me like a thickness idea of where
to connect the wing to and there we have
it so that is a both the eyes complete
I'm then just got Hannah to apply some
mascara but I did go back in with a
little bit of that corrupt shade I
always go back in with a little bit of
black after I apply eyeliner in case
it's the tiniest bit like uneven it was
part of my eyeliner hacks it just kind
of diffuses and hides the like any
mistakes that you've made then obviously
going back in with my fluffy brushes to
make sure everything is a-ok before I
continue
so yeah just getting Hannah to apply the
mascara and then we used her favorite
lashes it's the J makeup from Lilly
lashes and I just applied glue and then
when I apply lashes on somebody else I
get them to look down apply it in the
center first and then use tweezers to
kind of push it down either side these
ones are kind of it was a bit of a treat
just because she wears them all the time
so they kind of were naturally it fitted
to her eye so it wasn't too difficult
but if you're applying a brand new pair
of lashes
especially if they're quite thick banded
or mink I would definitely kind of play
around with them first bend them give
them a bit of flexibility before you
stick them down and then
you might even need to cut them to a to
make them suit their eye but yeah I
would just be a bit more kind of wary of
that for her brows I was so excited when
I worked in a Mac I used to just love
doing other people's brows I don't know
why I just kind of found it not like
easy but I just kind of knew what I
wanted to do so I told Hannah before and
I was really excited to fill in her
brows she does have them at micro bladed
so they didn't need it too much filling
in but I took the dip brows in chocolate
and then soft brown towards the front
feathering it up kind of towards the
front of the brow with the lighter shade
to create more of a natural appearance
and as you can see when she turns to the
side I loved it I personally feel like I
nailed her brows hey bitch mmm skin can
flick my face are you sure but you
forget sure about this bitch the shuttle
fun oh my god
oh this truck
oh my god no that never happens to her I
knew you were gonna do it I didn't
anyway I just continued to buff the
primer in her skin using a brush and
then a full foundation I'm taking the
Becca full coverage foundation I like to
apply it directly to the face and then
use a brush to kind of diffuse the
product kind of all over like spread it
out and stuff especially because it is a
full coverage I feel like it definitely
needed to be applied with a sponge but
like I said just applying no not
applying just spreading it out using a
brush and then going in with a damp
Beauty Blender to kind of blend it all
out together and I hadn't used this
foundation before and I thought the
color was perfect for her so yeah just
buffing that all over the skin and I use
a little brush when I was near her brows
just because I didn't want it to be I
didn't want like the foundation to go
into her brow so I needed to be a bit
more precise in that area and I didn't
really go up all the way underneath her
eye either because I feel like when you
use concealer you can do that so you
don't want to apply too much product
under there because underneath your eye
is like a sensitive area anyway and you
don't want it to crease either and also
you have to make sure that you blend
down the neck on anyone including
yourself
and then going in with the Attar shape
tape concealer this is in the shade
medium this one was deliberately meant
to be quite close to her skin color
because I've been loving at the moment
using a concealer that is close to the
skin color and then going in with a
highlighting pen afterwards to do the
brightening so just like I said taking
this underneath her eye in that
upside-down triangle emotion and also up
the sides of her nose for a little bit
of a nose contour then using the tapered
side of my Beauty Blender just pressing
that into her skin and then the tapered
side allows me to get really kind of up
and underneath her lash line you can
just watch her skin become flawless I
mean hannah has flawless skin anyway so
it kind of was inevitable it was going
to look so good but I'm in love with
this concealer and Hannah hadn't used it
before either when she saw that I bought
it she was super excited then like I
said going in with the prep and prime
pen this is Mac light based I'm just
applying this to kind of all the places
that you might have applied a light
concealer to begin with obviously you
don't have to do this and you can't just
use the lighter concealer to begin with
but I feel like this is just such a
lightweight product and it does so much
I wouldn't personally use this on its
own I feel like a lot of people use like
boost as a concealer which is totally
fine if you don't want that full
coverage or any like a huge amount of
coverage like I said because this is a
really lightweight then going in with
our best friend that this is Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder and
I'm just dusting this underneath her
eyes and all over her face to make sure
everything is set in place and it's
going to stay matte and it's going to
last us for when we get absolutely
steamed in later
then I'm going back in with that purely
in naked shade or this actually might
have been at creme brulee I'm not sure
but basically one of the Cree shades
that we used earlier just on a pencil
brush running this along her lower lash
line and connecting it back up into the
wing
I love applying lower lash kind of
shadow on myself and anyone I do a
makeup on it just because I think it
makes such a difference and connects
everything together and having a color
underneath the eye that really
complements their eye color will make
their eye color really pop and then
obviously to finish off just applying
some bottom lash mascara sorry I kept
kind of like coming across I did try and
crop out as much as me doing that as
possible for bronzer I'm taking a dark
golden by Mac it is one of their
mineralized skinfinish is technically
just a face powder for someone that's a
bit more tanned so it's of a really
natural color and it makes the perfect
bronzer this was one of Hannah's faves
as well and I'm just dusting it kind of
everywhere that I want to maybe slim
down some using it to kind of contour as
well then taking this shimmery bronzer
this is from the Mac and Mariah Carey
collection it's called my Mimi if it's
still in stock a hundred percent get it
while you still can
it just kind of gives a gorgeous glow to
the skin and finally I'm just
highlighting the tops of her cheeks and
all the places that I want to bring
forward and make pop using the new Mac
extra dimension skin finish in a double
gleam I think I showed this in my
snapchat the other day so these were
kind of like the first time using these
products on her for lips I am taking the
Mac and mariah carey collection a lip
pencil in new ombre basically a really
gorgeous brownie peach color i took that
kind of over the majority of her lips
and over lined them slightly but then i
was originally just going to keep it as
this but then i thought actually i
wanted something to tie it in with the
modi tones going on in the eyes so I'm
taking the buff like lip cream from
jouer and just kind of applying that to
her lips and then using my finger to
press it in to kind of blend it a bit
better and then going in with the Mac
time times that Mac Mariah Carey gloss
and this one I think was like just a
little bit more
honey or something like that basically a
peachy gloss to complement the look and
that is it it's time for the big reveal
like the makeup let's say it is about
your racquet No
yeah oh my god oh my god absolutely love
it
oh dear yeah look at them a little bit
yeah I know oh my gosh I absolutely love
it it's so weird is all I looking at it
with like my darker darker I love the
rose how do you know yeah
Oxana suppose but then my god this is
like I feel like you yeah I feel like
I've transformed now I need to secure
