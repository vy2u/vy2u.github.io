today I created this kind of matte lip
and I all kind of revolving around the
plum shades because it's autumn and
stuff like that I was sent a bundle of
it cosmetic stuff recently so I thought
I'll try and incorporate some of that
because you guys said you wanted to see
what it looked like and I've had really
good things about them so I wanted to
test them and try them and tell you what
I think it's super easy to create I've
kind of tried to keep things as
minimalistic as possible but still
create a wearable put together look for
you guys if you want to try out any of
the cosmetics products that I use in the
video then I have a discount code for
you guys it is full for it 15 and you
can use that for 15 percent off any $45
orders on it cosmetics calm so I will
leave all information like that and
click the link down below to use that
too so if you like the look of this look
then please keep watching
so stop I'm just going to be priming my
face
next the skin I'm gonna be trying the it
cosmetics CC cream in the shade medium I
still love you guys in the comments
saying you want to see something with
that a bit more natural in the skin just
because personally I prefer something
that's a bit more full coverage but I do
like to wear things like this on a day
that I like minimal makeup so I'm going
to be using the CC cream as my base I've
heard really good things about the CC
cream in a sense that you couldn't get a
really nice coverage from it if you
build it up but for people that prefer
like a minimal makeup and just wanna get
that skin a bit of a bit of coverage but
not anything too heavy kind of like that
no makeup makeup lip this is really good
for that it's really good for
brightening up the skin as well
after the brow so we're gonna go ahead
and do that off-camera cos I've done it
a million times before in a videos and I
do have a tutorial on it and like always
I will leave the link to that down below
with eyebrows done I'm gonna move on to
concealer and cream a contour so I'm
going to be using the it cosmetics bye
bye under-eye in the shade light for
under my eyes and the shade deep for
cream contour I've heard so many good
things about this I think this is quite
a full coverage concealer so having
something quite natural and share on the
skin like the CC cream and then pairing
it with a thick concealer might be more
people Street if you prefer their kind
of more natural skin look I've heard
this literally doesn't crease or crack
so I'm really excited to try this so
apply it I'm gonna use that it cosmetics
heavenly luxe dual ended I shadow brush
I'm gonna use this one for the contour
and this one for the concealer it says
it's an eye brush but I've been really
liking the way this applies concealer so
onion use it for that
I'm just gonna be blending that out with
a beauty blender then using the shade
deep and the other end of the ocean
airbrush I'm gonna use that cream to
contour
I definitely prefer cream contouring at
the moment to powder I don't know why I
think I just prefer the appearance of a
cream contracting it looks a lot more
natural and lot more yeah just a lot
more natural a lot more bronzed and
sunkissed rather than like a harsh line
and I'm just gonna be buffing that out
I'm really impressed of the way that
this concealer blends out because for
sometimes when containers I like full
coverage they can be really thick and
really hard to work with but this one
with the skin laughter I'm gonna leave
it there and I'm gonna move on to the
eye just in case there's any fallout I
can always clean up and I haven't set it
with powder yet so I'm gonna go ahead
and do one eye off camera now and then I
will show you how to do it so I've
already gone ahead and prepped my eye
and I'm just gonna set that in place
most of the showers I'm gonna be using
up from the it cosmetics naturally
pretty romantic speller so I thought
this is the kind of ideal palette for
the autumn time it's got light colors
and obviously dark colors as well as a
green in there a blue so you can kind of
create all kinds of looks with this warm
and cool I'm just gonna set my primer in
place using the shade hope oh my god
these are extremely pigmented then on a
fluffy crease brush I am taking the
shade adore which is just a light warm
brown shade as the initial transition
color
what's good about this palette is as
well like I said it just has a diverse
range of colors as well but they're all
matte shades as well which I feels
really on trend at the moment and if you
work them you can use them as eyeliners
and stuff like that which i think is
pretty cool then I'm taking a slightly
darker Brown from the palette and it's
oh it is this one here called embrace
then I'm going to take this plum shade
from makeup geek in the shade bitten and
use that as my lid shade
then going back to the it cosmetics
palette I'm taking this deep plum shade
called fate just using this to kind of
blend lid shade with the transition
shades and get back into the fluffy
brush and just blend that out then I'm
just gonna keep reapplying the lid color
and deepen up the socket until I'm happy
with it then I'm gonna use the
transferring power shade as my inner
corner and brow bone highlight I'm then
gonna take the it cosmetics note up
waterproof gel eyeliner pencil in the
shade black brown or something just a
bit softer and I'm just gonna run this
along my top waterline and bottom
waterline so these pencils are super
creamy so they're really comfortable to
wear if that makes sense like they're
not tugging on your or anything like
that and they're waterproof as well so
they should last all day
now I'm gonna set my face and finish the
rest of my face before I'm finished off
the ice so to set my under eyes I'm just
going to be taking the laura mercier
translucent powder on a real techniques
setting brush to bronze up my skin I'm
using the NYC smooth skin bronzing
powder in the shade sunny
to highlight my cheeks I'm going to be
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
highlighter in the shade Riviera so it's
the one that's just got a slight bronze
undertone to it now I'm gonna finish up
the eyes so going back to the it
cosmetics naturally pretty romantic
palette I am gonna take the shade
embrace again and run that on my lower
lash line
then we have tried this out this is the
it cosmetics tightline full lash black
primer using a lash primer is radiant
good in if you don't like to wear false
lashes but you want that kind of extra
volume from your mascara putting a
primer underneath it really helps and
lock in the curl and the length and
stuff like that so I'm excited to try
this but I am gonna be wearing false
lashes it's got like a really thin
petite one so it really grabs onto each
lash like so then I'm gonna go in with
the it cosmetics
hello lashes five-in-one clinically
proven mascara I love the brush of this
one I've used this a few times already
kind of reminds me of the Mac in extreme
dimension a scar in the sense it's got
that 361 yeah this was really great and
grabbing all the lashes and the little
bubbly bit at the ends really good for
the lower lashes as well I think it's
got that kind of melted fiber technology
that's meant to make your lashes look
longer as well now you could just leave
it at that but I want to add a bit more
drama to the look so I am gonna be
applying false lashes the ones I'm using
today are my favorite ones from Lily
lashes in the style Miami so this is the
finished eye look so pretty simple
really easy to create and I would say
perfect for the full time now onto the
lip I wanted to stick with the map plum
theme of the eye so I'm gonna take my
Mac plum lip liner and line my lips are
there
then I am taking Mac Viva Glam 3 to fill
in my lips so this is the finished look
