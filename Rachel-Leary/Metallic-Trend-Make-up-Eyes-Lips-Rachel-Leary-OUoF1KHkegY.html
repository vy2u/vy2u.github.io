but stronghold would
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I decided to do kind of a metallic
trend makeup look recently up and seeing
there's so many new products coming out
that have kind of like a metallic theme
going on like I know kylie jenner has
those metallic lip kits two-face have
those metallic lip kits jouer which is
what I'm going to be using in this video
because I've got some the other day
these are on snapchat I picked up a few
of they do a prone on my lip creams in
the metallic finishes and also the lip
topper in skinny dip which is going to
be the one that I use so I kind of went
for more of a nude metallic thing just
because that's what I prefer but if
you'd like to see like along the lines
of that kylie jenner trend cuz I know
her newest metallic lipstick is really
dark if you'd like to see like a
metallic dark makeup look let me know
I'm also using a new product on my eyes
from lit cosmetics and it's one of them
metallic glitters so recently like I
said I picked up stoney metallic
products I thought I would do a tutorial
if you like the look of this makeup look
make sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already and
let's jump into the tutorial typically
going to do our eyes at first I'm going
to go ahead and prime them using my
Urban Decay eye should I post a potion
in Eden as always and I like this one
because you can kind of use it to help
sculpt out your brows which I've already
done as well I'll leave all the products
down below as always and I'm also just
going ahead and setting this with powder
cuz it makes it so much easier to blend
a shadow
speaking of which I'm going in with the
initial transition color which is creme
brulee from makeup geek and just going
in with a really fluffy brush I think
this is the Sigma e-40 which is my
favorite for these kind of crease colors
and just blending back and forth in
windscreen wiper motions then going in
with this color this is Mac uninterupted
Pro Longwear
eyeshadow I have a feeling it's been
discontinued because I couldn't find it
anywhere online but I know there is a
makeup geek eyeshadow that's super super
similar I think it might be called
preppy or doesn't sounds or something
but I just wanted to use it kind of a
more different undertone of a warm eyes
shadow this is still quite a warm look
but this one is definitely a lot more of
like a Sandhya nude color which kind of
goes with the champagne a bit more
speaking of which again I'm going in
with another makeup eyeshadow this is
a foiled eyeshadow I think it's
starry-eyed and we're just going to use
this as a base because I am going to go
in with more of a liquid metal eyeshadow
on the top and this is from lit
cosmetics it's in the color addicted as
you can see is such a gorgeous champagne
color and I like to take the glue and
then dunk the brush that it comes in
with it and then dip the brush in it to
the product which kind of makes it that
metal finish and then just a brush it
across my lid as you'll see
the final eyeshadow we're going to be
using is Coco bear from makeup geek as
well and just using this to further
deepen up the socket and just blend the
lid colors and all the cruise colors
together and just create that warm smoky
eye effect then going in with a wipe and
just cleaning up the edge at the angle
that I want and going in with the
pigment vanilla from Mac and I'm going
to wet this with my mac fix+ as well to
get a super metallic finish then going
in with the NYC liquid liner and just
applying mascara because it's me you
know I'm going to be wearing lashes and
these are my absolute favorite from the
Lert they out in the style what the
fluff and I do have a discount code in
the description to get you a money off
now onto the face I'm going to skip this
step just because I include it in
everything but I will show you some of
the cheek products that I'm using this
is the Maybelline I think it's the cheek
brick or bronzer brick in the color
blonde so this bronzer is meant to be
really complimentary on at people with
blonder hair so I'm really impressed
with the color it's not too orange and
it's not too muddy I really like it and
then I'm going in with this blusher from
makeup geek in the color bromance which
is a really gorgeous shimmery rose gold
color it's really pink but it has
speckles of like gold running through it
and I've not actually heard of this one
before and I'm absolutely obsessed with
it then obviously to highlight I'm going
in with this color moonstone from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Sun dipped
palette and just blending that and
glowing from the guard's honey
continuing on with our I make up on to
the lower lash line I'm again going back
in with that lit cosmetics glitter and
just kind of concentrating it mainly on
the inner most part of my eye just
because I think it looks really
complementary if you take a bit of the
shimmer that you're using your lid and
just placing it like I said on that
inner part of your lower lash line and
then I really wanted to kind of
concentrate that uninterrupted color
along the lower lash line just because I
didn't want to use the same warm tones
that I always use and that one is kind
of a really unique color and then I'm
just going in with a bottom lash mascara
and that is the eyes completed now on to
the lips I'm lining my lips with this
Natasha de nonne a pencil in medium
natural it's like my new favorite pencil
it just is the perfect natural color now
for metallic lip colors I'm using the
jus a lip topper in it skinny dip but
this one is called a Pomplamoose and I
know that's such a funny name but I'm
just obsessed with this whole range but
like I said I'm going in with skinny dip
and that is just a lip topper it doesn't
have a huge amount of color pigmentation
to it so I'm going in with this soft
matte lip cream from NYX and the color
Cairo as a base and I just kind of
waited for that to mattify and dry and
then like I said it going in with the
lip chopper in skinny and skinny dip
from Shoei and I've linked it below and
I think it's out stock at the moment so
I'm really really sorry but you can add
yourself to the waiting list and then to
broody enhance that metallic finish I'm
going in with the highlights that we
used earlier and just highlighting my
Cupid's bow and patting it in at the
center of my lips as well and this is a
really good trick to make your lips
appear fuller and that is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to give it
a thumbs up if you did and subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in the next one
