today I asked you guys on my Instagram
and Twitter yesterday whether or not you
would be interested in seeing my kind of
interpretation of a minimal holiday
makeup look and like all of you said yes
this is the kind of look that I
personally would wear on holiday if
you've watched my videos you know I'm
all about like full coverage heavy glam
so for me this is minimal make-up or the
seat for some people this might be a lot
of makeup for some people but I have
tried to use as minimal products on the
face as possible and kind of multi-use
products all over the face and I just
kind of wanted to achieve that
effortless holiday glow look so I've
gone really easy on the eyes and I kind
of wanted to add a bold color somewhere
so where else did I go on the lips
November than orange just because it's a
summery color but you can pair it with
whatever you want and yeah so if you
like the idea of learning how to create
this minimal holiday inspired makeup
look then please keep watching also if
you want to know where my body shoots
from I will leave it down below because
it is a body suit and I'm obsessed with
it so yeah all information as always
will be in the downbar so let's get
started
so starting off with a clean up bare
face I'm using this Illamasqua radiance
veil primer as my base I'm in love with
this primer it gives us such a gorgeous
glow underneath your foundation and your
makeup which is kind of ideal and the
look that we were going for for this
holiday inspired look
since I've not actually been on a
holiday I'm gonna fake my tan as you can
see my skin is naturally a bit paler
than my neck so I'm kind of balancing it
out using this benefit
do you wait is it do you who that
something like that but basically it's
like a liquid bronzer you can apply this
underneath foundation or on top I'm
applying this underneath as a base to
give my skin a bit of color this has
absolutely no coverage to it so this
isn't a foundation but you can obviously
well this his foundation if I was
naturally tanned I probably would over
the top it's just my base
but for foundation I'm using Mac face
and body in at c3 this has a pretty
minimal coverage and it's really good in
hot weather this because I'm pretty sure
it's water-resistant so it works well in
the humidity and adds a really nice glow
to the skin as well for concealer I'm
taking Mac Pro Longwear in nw20 and
taking a really small pump rubbing it
between my fingers I'm just dabbing it
underneath my eye and then blending it
out this is kind of the most coverage
that we are gonna have and I did want to
brighten up underneath my eye because I
think it just adds a bit more dimension
to the face and kind of makes the rest
of the face look more tanned when you
add your bronzer and stuff which is kind
of the look we were going for that kind
of bronzed glowy look so I'm just
buffing that into my skin with this
morphe brush and then I am going in with
this NYX liquid bronzer in the color
pure gold or pure golden or something
and I'm taking a stippling brush and
just using this to kind of really really
lightly contour and bronze the skin
where I would normally contour and
bronze is like a powder or something
like that
and so going on the tops of my forehead
using a duo fiber brush as well insures
that you don't apply too much product
and absorbs any of the excess then I'm
going in with this Topshop glow pot in
the color gleam I tried to find it
online but I'm not sure if they still do
it anymore it might only be available
in-store but like I said I'm just using
a my finger and dabbing that onto the
places that I want to highlight so just
on the tops of my cheekbones and down
the bridge of my nose keep his bow and
actually between my brows and then I'm
just buffing that in with the dura fiber
brush to make sure it's all blended
together then I am taking this nice
pressed powder and I'm not saying my
whole face I'm just setting the areas
that I am prone to getting like a really
dewy throughout the day so the sides of
my nose and
or head this has no coverage to it
either so it's not adding anything like
that it's just mattifying the skin and
making sure it's all gonna last all day
and through the humidity this is a
holiday it must-have product for me
matte gold deposit I'm obsessed with it
this is what I've been doing a lot on my
skin recently and a lot of you been
asking what the glow to my skin is is
this I literally dust it everywhere with
a big fluffy brush to add a golden glow
it doesn't add too much and it's not
something that you wear on its own it is
something that you go quite light hand
with because it is quite a dark color
but just dusting all over your skin I
think is the most gorgeous glow then for
blush I'm taking the balm a Big Momma
blusher as it's like a golden pink color
which kind of ties in with the theme of
just kind of looking really bronzy and
dewy and then I'm gonna go ahead and do
my eyebrows using my Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow definer in soft brown and
then it's setting that in place using my
L'Oreal brow artist plumper and I think
medium dark just to set it all in place
so it can resist the heat on a holiday
and it just add a bit more color to them
if you have naturally full brows you can
probably just wear this on its own then
I am at taking gold deposit again and
I'm just using this on the eye this is
the only product we're gonna be using on
the eye and just packing that on with a
small shader brush all over my lid and
then going in with a soft blending brush
that has no product on it and just
softening out that edge because
obviously we don't want it to look
really like touching anything
so just softening out the edge since
that's the only thing that we do have on
the eye and yeah just blending it out
I'm then taking gold deposit again on
the same brush and just running that
along my lower lash line just to kind of
tie everything it together and I think
applying a shadow on the bottom of your
eye really brings the eye look together
and then they're taking the globe whore
again from Topshop and just using that
to highlight my inner corner so it's
gonna tie in with everything that we've
got going on on the face as we are using
the same product so it also saves room
in your travel bag as well so you don't
have to pack any additional product and
then I'm gonna go ahead and curl my
lashes and apply a waterproof mascara
this is the new Mac in extreme at
dimension mascara as you'll see is
absolutely phenomenal if you don't want
to wear false lashes this literally
gives a false lash effect and the 360
brush allows you to get all your little
baby lashes as well and I'm only
actually gonna be applying mascara to my
top lashes just because we're going so
minimal on the eye makeup sometimes I
find it looks better when I don't have
anything on my bottom lashes so that is
the finished eye look and then to finish
up I'm just applying the next Sun is it
Sun one soft matte lip cream which is
just a really nice a bright orange color
just because I was feeling the summer
holiday vibes and I love these kind of
colors for that time of year and it that
is the finished makeup look so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial give
it a thumbs up if you did and leave me a
future requests in the comments down
below I always love reading them to
inspiration but until next time I will
see you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
