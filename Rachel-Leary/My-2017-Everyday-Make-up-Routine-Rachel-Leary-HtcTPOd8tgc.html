happy New Year to all of you guys and I
definitely I'm going to try and make
2017 like my year I feel like everyone
keeps saying this but I definitely want
to put a lot more effort into content
that I'm producing and listen to you
guys more in the stuff that you want to
see so with that being said this is
definitely one of my most requested
videos and it is an everyday makeup
routine I know on my channel is super
glam a lot of the time and that is what
I love to do I do love doing full
coverage full glam looks that is not
what I look like 99.9% the time there
are days when I just need to obviously
put some sort of face on I don't need a
full glam face so I thought I would show
you what that is if that makes sense
so for me this is a minimal amount of
makeup it might be loads for some people
or whatever but this is like a minimal
makeup look and it is something that I
can personally achieve every day I use a
lot of my favorite products and when I
want to wear minimal makeup I do like to
focus on skin and then just really only
wear mascara on my eyes so yeah that's
kind of sounds like something you do too
and you want to see some new products or
just see what I wear on like a
day-to-day basis if I've got to put
something on and make sure to give this
video a thumbs up subscribe if you
haven't already and let's go ahead and
get started
every day I'd like to focus mainly on my
skin so to start with I like to prep my
skin and this is the 'epic see rosewater
makeup fixing spray I think rosewater is
incredibly good for your skin so I
always like to start with a good
moisturizing spray then for primer I am
taking the Nivea post shave balm and
just applying that with a brush all over
my skin and mainly concentrating it on
the places I find that my makeup doesn't
really last as long which tends to be
like my nose area and then for the skin
I'm actually taking this tint from NARS
is their Velvet Matte tint in the shade
simpler it's to match my tan and this is
a really gorgeous I feel like this is
really good for everyday because it's
super lightweight but has a really good
coverage then just applying it concealer
to brighten up underneath my eyes and
this is the urban decay I think this is
the weightless skin concealer in the
shade light warm and just buffing that
in using the same makeup brush that I
use to apply my foundation just to make
me look more awake in kind of balance
out the kind of highlighted areas of my
skin and then setting that in place with
my favorite powder of all time the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder this
is just incredible for everyday it's
just got no cover like no coverage or
color it just sets everything in place
for bronze i'ma taking my Mac mineralize
skinfinish in a dark golden I find this
is the perfect everyday bronzer it's not
too orange it's got a really gorgeous
all of you undertone so it's nothing too
heavy either and it has kind of a nice
subtle glow to the skin as well speaking
of which I do love a glowy bronzer as
well and this is the mineralized
skinfinish in global glow I just like to
test this on the top of my forehead and
my cheekbones just to add a bit more
warmth to my skin and then finally to
highlight I'm taking my favorite
highlighting palette of all time this is
the sleek Cleopatra's kiss highlighting
palette and I just like to apply this to
at my cheekbones my nose and my Cupid's
bow as well just to add a gorgeous glow
to my skin for eyebrows for everyday I
just like to use a pencil just because
I'm quite comfortable with that and
confident with it as well and I love
these ones from benefit this is the
precise brow pencil in shade 4 so I like
to use this in the tail of my brow and
kind of halfway across and then I like
to take the goof proof proof brow pencil
in shape too through the front of my
eyebrow just as a slightly
like to show to create that natural
gradient effect for mascara I love
Maybelline mascaras so much and this is
their colossal mascara and I'm just
applying it to my top lashes just
because I find when I'm just going to
only be wearing mascara it looks more
flattering on me if I only apply it to
the top and then I'm going to take my
highlighting palette again just dust
that lightly in my inner corner just to
kind of brighten up the inner corners of
my eye and for lips I don't want
anything too dramatic to go along with
my face so I'm using the NYX soft matte
lip cream in Cairo and then again
highlighting like Cupid's bow just to
bring that forward slightly and that's
literally it I really hope you guys in
it joy to my everyday makeup routine
super quick and easy and achievable for
me and I hope you guys feel like you can
achieve this too with whatever products
you've got so make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in
the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
