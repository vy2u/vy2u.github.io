oh hey guys welcome back to my channel
so today I recreated this makeup look
for you guys it was a makeup I did on my
birthday and I asked if you guys wanted
to see a tutorial and majority of you
said yes it's very similar to a lot of
looks maybe that you've seen before from
me but that is because these are my
absolute favorite looks to do hence why
I did it for my birthday all products
will be listed at down below because
this is kind of a chatty tutorial so I
may not be kind of holding everything up
so in depth ly like I usually would so
like I said everything is always listed
down below if you enjoy this video make
sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already yeah
without further ado let's begin this
makeup tutorial okay so to begin I am
gonna just spray my skin with that touch
I do eat skin miss just as like a way of
hydrate my skin because sometimes I can
never be bothered to you know a probably
a moisturizer if I'm feeling super lazy
and especially by now I'm going to be
trying a lot of makeup and cuz it was my
birthday you know it's gonna be a lot of
makeup I would need to make sure that my
skin is super hydrated then I just kind
of like buff the excess into my skin so
doesn't sit okay so moving on to
eyebrows loads of you asking like my
eyebrows at the moment I don't know this
cuz I've been doing differently I've
been kind of putting a lot more time
into them I've been like loving the look
of a sculpted out brow at the moment so
even though I do definitely plan to do a
really more in-depth iran tutorial i
thought i would include it we're going
to use our medium dip ralph first
because i like to do the tail of my
eyebrow first I'm just taking a sigma
e06 winged liner brush and starting just
kind of like halfway across and creating
the shape that I want for the tail
already you can see like a glitter on my
face I just filmed my Halloween tutorial
that went up on Tuesday and it just
seems to be lingering I always like to
use a dip brow towards the end of my
brow just because it applies a lot more
pigmentation my browsing actually short
so I need it to kind of look as real as
possible and it doesn't matter so much
so it's not totally tidy underneath
because that's why you sculpt them up
with
cela then I like to take my brow where's
and soft brown and kind of run
I like lift up my brow to make the skin
kind of tighter then just run it along
underneath go connect it to where we
just was applying the dipbrow furthering
them and you can see I'm just using that
really light frequent strokes and I'll
just go over the tail as well slightly
now when I get to the front I just kind
of mimic the brush hair move the brush
the my eyebrow hairs and change my
direction to go upwards then I'm taking
the Kevyn Aucoin skin enhancer in the
shade sx0 form and just on a little more
fear and one-seven-zero brush
concentrating that under the arch and
then just dragging it across then I
actually like to go across the top of
them to give some real definition and
ship then I'm just going to go ahead and
up pry my eye and get it ready for a
shadow I'm going to go ahead and do this
I and everything off camera just because
it's easier to just do one on camera
here that makes sense okay so I just
went ahead and primed my eye using the
Maybelline Color tattoo in the color
creme de nude I'm not sure if that's
only available in the US or like there's
just something about that I feel like
it's quite hard to get but it's
literally just Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
so y'all good now I'm taking the morphe
3502 King like this color and this color
and just kind of dipping my brush in
them and just mixing them together as my
initial transition shade just buffing
this back and forth in the crease this
is definitely going to be a look you've
seen a hundred times before but it was
my birth
day so I did a classic look that I loved
I think the good thing about this is
well this is what I do when I watch
videos even if it's a video I feel that
person has done so many times before or
they have like a certain style I just
take inspiration from the way that they
do it and then if I want to switch other
colors or put my own twist on it then I
will which is what I hope you guys kind
of take from my videos especially looks
like this like yeah I know it's like a
birthday kind of get ready with me type
video and it'll be a look like I said
that you've seen before but you don't
have to use these colors and just learn
from technique dipping back in it to the
same palette I'm taking this warmer
color here just a slightly smaller brush
and just concentrating that and the
Curry's below the obviously the initial
colors that we've just put down to
create that gradient can actually
rethink are you a 1/4 quite like a soft
or like a minimal amount of colors in
the crease because they don't like to be
too too much because I knew I wanted
like a step liner and it was for the
daytime anyway so nothing's will grow
then just going back in with the 2t for
not I haven't picked up any additional
product I'm just buffing these two in
then I don't even smaller fluffy brush
I'm taking this color here just to
further deepen the crease kind of really
concentrating this on the outer part of
the eye circular motions buffing upwards
into the previous colors and then going
back in with the two to four and a
little bit of the initial transition
color that we used just using that to
buff everything together the lid shade
again still using the same palette I
just take this shimmery color here wait
no here and put that all over my lid and
this is using a Mac go to 14 like the
little gingy brush just kind of having
that on I always kind of drag it down to
bring out the most of the pigmentation
just kind of taking that almost like a
little bit over halfway across the lid
then going back in with the kind of
medium-sized fluffy brush that I had the
medium orange cutter on just using that
not I haven't picked up anything extra
just to merge the shimmers with the
crease color then I'm just taking a
makeup wipe to clean and create that
winged shape of it always do I find this
to be the most easiest and effective
method especially when I'm about to do
winged liner just because it gives a
really good base and speaking of which
I'm a taking the taut Tartus eyeliner
pen and I've been acting like this is so
so so so black and so like easy to use
as you'll see and I kind of wanted to
thicker wing than I normally do because
it's my birthday as the liner just
starting from the inner corner
that was so easy I'm an obsessive this
is so dark as well then once you're
happy with the thickness across the lid
you can I then do the base line of my
liner and then drag it down and then
just work on it from there
like it's so hard to liner on
then I always go back in with my wife
and just reopen it up then I'm just
taking a little pencil brush and there's
kind of darker brown color here and I
just come in with my eye open look down
into a mirror and just define my crease
even more and add a bit more depth then
using my medium fluffy brush just making
sure to diffuse any harsh nuts and then
a little bit of the shadows kind of
transferred onto the eyeliner so just
going back over
like so then I'm going to go ahead and
apply mascara and I'm using the tartar
tears and scar as well and then it for
lashes I'm a really can't remember the
style or like the exact name
I think it's winning from the lower
lashes so they look like this
and I'm just going to go ahead and do
them now the glue is just drying but
this is what the eyes look like with the
lashes on obviously I don't completely
finish them yet but now we can move on
to this good okay so for the skin I'm
just going to go ahead and apply my
primer and today we're going to be using
the anivia post shave balm or whatever
it's called just slap it across your
face there and just gonna blend that in
and you guys will be shocked I'm not
using my Real Techniques multitask brush
I'm using this one from morphe which is
the g 39 clinic the foundation I used
the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow in the
shade 209 again I'm not 100% sure if
this is available in the UK yaks eye
rehab it comes to the UK that is for
sure but I got this while I was in
America I am tan my face is also pale so
if you're thinking oh my god that is so
dark you would be correct but it matches
my time and that's the end result that
we're going talk and I've been really
really loving this morphe g36 brush to
buff in and my foundation I'm obsessed
with the finish at this foundation it's
already gorgeous subtle glow it's
something to boil a or anything so I
love it as a really nice coverage for
concealer I'm taking the taut shape tape
concealer in the shade like medium I've
been obsessed this asks such an amazing
coverage and I really like the wand
applicator it's super thick and this is
how it kind of like the color balances
out on my skin I apply a slightly darker
foundation so it matches
but then the concealer I wear it's
always a lot lighter and that way when I
blend it all out it kind of lightens up
my whole skin and it doesn't look so
drastic and then I always take a little
brush and use this to get right up close
to my eyeliner and really sharpen it out
and to blend that out I've been really
liking the more Fiat G at 40 brush to do
that
sorry about the really dark background I
literally just owned a Halloween look
but let me know if you guys like it
then once I've applied all of that I
don't have anymore creams to apply to my
face so I'm just going to go ahead and
set that all in place with my Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder okay
moving on to the rest of the skin I'm
going to take Mac give me sauna bronzer
this has been my favorite bronze at the
moment and just a walk using that to
warm up my skin I have to be quite
careful now my hair's lighter by the way
thank you so much for all like the
lovely comments on my hair I was just
sad at first I thought oh my god it's
quite a drastic what to me it's quite a
drastic change I don't know um you guys
notice as much but for me it was intense
but I'm literally obsessive there I'm
glad you guys like it too and then it's
taking my peaches and cream sculpting
powder in light/medium on a more Fiji at
37 I'm just going to throw that across
the room I can use that to likely define
much more then cuz it's your birthday
you can be fancy and use your favorite
makeup I'm taking deep the a Marc Jacobs
blusher in lines and last night just
kind of all a big fat smile and then for
my highlight I'm taking the ultimate
glow kit from Anastasia Beverly Hills
and mixing what I'm kind of gonna dab my
brush and all of them but mainly it is a
white sand and like sunray but maybe
white sand yes
fancy
so that is the skin complete just moving
back on to the eyes I'm pretty sure all
I did was take my give me at Sun bronzer
on a pencil brush and just smoke up my
lash line
sorry if you think the light keeps
changing I'm using natural light and
clouds just come therefore obsessed with
this mascara for lower lashes I think it
really defines them well then it finally
for my lips obviously was it going to be
a buff they look on me if it wasn't
something glossy and nude and I am just
going to take the oak pencil from Maddie
illamasqua tees lipstick which looks
like this and then I top it with the
amore Fiat cream what is it cream lip
polish in blush recently I was seeing a
lot of color asking if I've had my lips
done and I haven't I promise no one will
let me but I find oak pencil from Mac to
be subtle to be it such a good pencil if
you want it over on your lips
mmm-hmm much too much this is such a me
look I can't even tell you so this is my
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys like it it is so so so me
