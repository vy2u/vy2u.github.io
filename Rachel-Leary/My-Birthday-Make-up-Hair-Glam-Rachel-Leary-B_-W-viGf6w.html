today I am filming my birthday makeup
that I posted on my Instagram the other
day I'll leave the link down below if
you want to see that post or maybe I'll
just put a picture of it here but I
asked you guys if you want to see a
tutorial and the majority of you said
yes um please don't think this is going
to be something totally different
because it's my birthday I wanted to
kind of will do a look that I know that
I love which of course as you guys
probably know is a bronze kind of smokey
eye but this time I added a bit of
glitter and did my hair I actually I'm
wearing don't know if you can tell I've
got hair extensions in so this is why
I've kind of made it like a birthday
glam makeup and hair get ready with me
because I never normally wear hair
extensions but because it was my first
day kind of wanted to do that a little
bit extra so let me know if you guys
like my hair with extensions in my
hair's already long anyway it's kind of
just for the layers and stuff and these
are from at Beauty works and I like I
said I've never wanted scented before
but these are some of the nicest it
literally feels like real hair they're
so comfortable and I'll leave the
details about these down below and I do
have a coupon code for you guys so I
will leave that in the description bar
down below as well you guys know get
your hands on some of these extensions
but yeah without rambling on too long
let's just jump into it as always I'm
doing my eyebrows first using my
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is in a
medium brown then I am priming my
eyelids using my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot please excuse my hands throughout
this video I know they're awful but I am
using my makeup geek eyeshadow in the
shade Sahara is my initial transition
shade and just buffing that into the
crease then I am further deepening the
socket with Coco bear also from makeup
geek
for the lid shade I'm using it to foiled
eyeshadows one in the shade in the
spotlight and one in the shame shame in
the shade flame thrower so I'm just
concentrating the in the spotlight shade
and then in a third of my eye and then
using flamethrower as the outer shade
then I am just going in with a fluffy
brush and buffing that out and pressing
the beige occ glitter on the top of
where we place the in the spotlight
shadow using the Mac Smith Mac mixing
medium in the eyeliner form to adhere it
to the eye then going in with a dark
brown shimmery shade I'm just using that
to further deepen the socket and almost
create a soft cut crease kind of look
to deepen further and finally I'm using
corrupt from makeup geek which is
basically just a matte black really
softly in the crease to add the soft cut
crease look that we'd created with the
brown shade and going in with a fluffy
brush to make sure there's no harsh
lines so you guys know I love a wing so
as always I'm going in with a wipe and
cleaning up the edges I'm then using a
white eyeshadow to highlight my brow
bone and inner corner
then using my NYC liquid liner to create
a flick I have tutorials on eyeliner and
eyebrows in the description down bar
below as always I just find they're kind
of boring to do on camera all the time
then going in with my Velvet 59 My Fair
lashes mascara just to apply a light
coat because we're going in with lashes
these are the Aikido lashes in the ship
in style alumina and either code in the
description bar below for them as well
then onto the face just to hydrate my
face I'm using my mac fix+
then it using my Olay flawless blur and
hydration primer just to get ready for
foundation
full foundation I am using my Giorgio
Armani luminous silk in the shade 6 and
buffing that in with a sigma f80 kabuki
brush
 seal I'm taking two one is more
to my skin color shade and one is more
for highlighting its NARS radiant creamy
concealer in custard and then the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer in the shade
light warm and then I'm just blending
that in with a damp Beauty Blender
for a cream contour i'm using the Bobbi
Brown Foundation stick in the shade
almond number seven and then to blend
that in more naturally I'm using the
Chanel Chalet
the Chanel's a lady tan just because
that's slightly lighter and so it
creates more other enormous transition
I'd say
to set all those creams I am just
dousing myself in fix+ and then pressing
that into my skin with a Beauty Blender
then using my neve cosmetics translucent
powder in the shade nude to highlight to
highlight ya to kind of enhance the
highlight under my eyes and then using
my mac mineralize skinfinish in the
shade give me son I'm using that to set
my contour and add a bit more warmth to
my skin for highlighting I'm using the
Laura Geller baked illuminator in the
shade gilded honey and just applying
that night nicely the hell-like
softly into the tops of my cheekbones
and then using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills highlighter in the shade starlight
which is more of an iridescent pearl
finish I am just pressing that on the
top
you
back onto the eyes I'm going back in
with Coco bear and just running that
under my eyes with a pencil brush and
then using the shade chickadee to kind
of soften the edges and blend out on a
fluffier brush
for lips I wanted to keep it pretty
simple cuz I was going out for dinner so
I'm just using the Tanya burr cosmetics
lip gloss in the shade daydream because
I knew I could always just reapply this
really easily if it was to come off
while I was eating or drinking this is
the end result of the makeup like I said
it's nothing too dissimilar that you
haven't seen before but it's one of my
favorite lips but now on to the hair so
I'd already pre-cut my hair using my
nume 5 in one color and the thickest
barrel this is the full head weft and I
only used one of these on my hair then I
used this is the mid-sized weft and I
again irony's one of them and this is
the face-framing weft and I used both of
these so here I'm just showing you how I
curl them is pretty much
self-explanatory in the sense that I
just split it in half and then wrapped
the hair around the wand and held it for
about 15 to 20 seconds did a loose curl
like so I have more hair detail and
information in the description bar down
below but I am just separating my hair I
think I do
two big layers and then two smaller
layers but for the smallest layer well
the smaller so the first layer I am
taking up the majority of my hair and
just leaving enough for me to clip in
the full size weft I back comb the roots
and spray them with hairspray before
applying the West and do that for every
layer basically so here's a sped up
version of me applying my accent it was
the first time doing it so I have no
idea what they look like from the back I
think they were okay but they turn
alright in the end so enjoy
this is everything all finished hair and
makeup I really hope you guys liked it
