voices in my head
you forgot
hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I thought I would film my go-to
holiday look which is basically the
makeup I wore every night when I was
going out and when I was on a holiday so
it is a lot of makeup it's glam it's not
like my everyday holiday makeup because
that was literally like nothing if
anything at all this is what I want on a
night out if this is a lot of makeup for
you that's fine this is just what I find
to kind of like withstand the heat and
withstand like dancing and stuff so for
me I have to apply love makeup for that
to work and if I want it to all stay in
place and stay matte and stuff like that
so I really hope you guys enjoy this
video I haven't done a full band makeup
in forever so I really missed them I
know a loads of you probably going to be
like oh my god you do these kind of
looks a lot but I really feel like I
haven't filmed one of these in a while
and this is literally what I might go to
makeup looks it's for me if I'm not
filming obviously it's super quick super
easy and I feel makes such like an
impact because it's quite glam but it
really didn't take a look effort and I
use a few new products as well I also
give it three lip options at the end the
one that I'm wearing currently it's kind
of the one I would have worn on the
nights out just because nudes are like a
go-to and they're super easy so keep
reapplying but I do give some other
options at the end if you prefer
something a bit more adventurous so yeah
if you like the look of this makeup look
make sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already and
let's get started
so to begin starting with a clean face
and just getting my hair out the way I'm
going to moisturize my skin using my Mac
strobe cream this is one of my favorite
moisturizers to wear underneath
foundation especially if I know I'm
going in with quite a matte and like
full coverage foundation because it
gives a really gorgeous glow underneath
and keeps my skin feeling really
hydrated
then foot primer I'm using the NYX first
brace primer spray just because this is
such a quick and easy way to prime your
skin and it kind of hydrates at the same
time and the foundation I'm using the
cover effects oil-free foundation in the
shade g50 which is obviously a bit more
tan too than my natural skin tone but I
was more tired on holiday I did mention
in my previous video that this was my
go-to of the nights out just because
like I said has a matte finish it has no
SPF in it so it looked really good in
pictures and it lasted all evening then
if I can see that I'm using my
Maybelline age rewind concealer in the
shade light just to brighten up
underneath my eyes and like obviously
highlight my face conceal any dark
circles and it's super easy to apply and
blend into the skin as well so this was
a must-have me on holiday
I was all about cream bronzing on a
holiday and this is the Georgia Armani
master lick my strode liquid bronzer in
the shade 1:1 at zero and I'm just using
this brush from Mac just to apply it
it's like a duo fiber contour brush like
a flat flat top to come to a brush and
I'm obsessed with it especially for this
product so I'm just kind of applying it
to all the places I want to define a bit
more so my cheekbones and the tops of my
forehead and along my jaw this just
really really warmed up my complexion
and like I said I was all about being
super bronzed and tanned on holiday so
this it's like my favorite product I
know it loads of you probably thinking
like oh my god you look super Brown or
like super tanned but in pictures and
stuff it kind of did the most for me it
lasted as well especially when I said it
with powder and bronzer on the top and
I'd literally am obsessed with this
product
I hate to say but this may have actually
replaced my laura mercier translucent
setting powder this is the RC ameno
color powder and it is a must-have on
holiday I don't bake with it I just said
it I set everywhere with it and it
literally makes you look airbrushed you
literally can not sweat through this
light this is the key to making your
makeup last especially in hot countries
or like somewhere where you're going to
be like sweating a lot or anything like
that this honestly is amazing and I'm
going to set my eyelids as well just
because I didn't apply an eyeshadow
primer I use my concealer as my
eyeshadow primer so I just wanted to
make sure it was matte and yet this is
literally a holiday must-have I really
should have included it in my previous
video but yet this literally kept me
matte and made my makeup last all
evening and then two bronze I'm going in
with the bourgeois golden bronzer this
basically had a little shimmer to it
most of the products I applied to my
face didn't really have a matte finish
besides my contour powder but I just
wanted to glow all evening so I was
obsessed with this bronzer
I literally never realized how much
difference contouring made this is the
makeup geek contour pan in bad habit I'm
just taking an eyeshadow brush I think
this is my Sigma e-40 and just using
this to really lightly softly lightly
softly contour my cheeks as you can see
it really just defined my cheeks a lot
more so I'm obsessive doing this at the
moment and yeah just going in on the
other side as well
just to give my cheekbones a bit more
definition
this has been my go-to blusher at the
moment it is from makeup geek in the
shade romance essentially is a really
soft pink with a touch of gold running
through it so had a really gorgeous
shimmer which like I said previously I
was obsessed with on holiday my skin
would not be complete without some matte
gold deposit of course I literally take
a giant fluffy brush and just dust this
everywhere to add some final warmth to
my skin and that final glow
I didn't have these exact shades on her
day but these are two shades from the
new Anastasia Beverly Hills Suites Glo
kit in marshmallow and butterscotch and
oh my god I've just found my new
favorite highlighting combination as you
can see literally it is beaming
obviously the marshmallows a lot more of
a pearl color and butterscotch is more
of the golden so it mixed together I am
obsessed if you guys get the chance to
definitely grab your hands on this one
these two colors literally just by the
palate for these two colors seriously
they are amazing
now onto eyebrows I used my dip brow in
medium brown and my brow definer through
the front in soft brown onto the eyes I
didn't have this palette while I was
away but I really wish I did is the NYX
ultimate shadow palette in warm neutrals
which is exclusive to Selfridges I
literally got it the other day and flew
it which is perfect so I'm just taking a
big fluffy brush and that originals kind
of the original that first soft brown
color I showed you and just using that
as my initial transition color
and going in with this more brick deeper
rich brown color on a smaller fluffy
brush just to kind of create that
transition we're going for more of a
rounded I guess this was so much easier
for me to do on a holiday and I thought
it looked really dramatic but it
literally was a required minimal effort
and then going back in with the original
fluffy brush just to soften out all the
edges
you guys know this process by now and
now taking a darker brown color this one
had slightly more of a firmer perkier
undertone to it on this the same
bug and maybe something a tiny bit
smaller but yet basically just creating
that transition and really creating that
warm up blown out smoky look
this may be my favorite pigment of all
time it's from neve cosmetics you've
never heard of them before they do the
best i shadow pigments I'd like ever use
this one is called the sales I think
correct me if I'm wrong I don't know how
to pronounce it but yeah it was I
literally wore this every night on
holiday on my sheet on my eyes literally
everywhere it is a such a gorgeous brown
coppery color and then mixing these two
colors from the same NYX palette on a
smaller definer brush I am just using
that going back into the crease blending
everything out and creating a bit more
definition and a bit more of a smoky
effect then on a really really small
definer brush I'm mixing these two dark
colors together and really working that
into my crease point and concentrating
it on the outermost part of my eye just
to kind of emphasize the smokiness and
it's kind of like salt finish up the
eyelid and create that gradient effect
I literally never wore eyeliner on
holiday I always took a flat definer
brush like this and the two dark colors
that we just put in the crease and just
smudge that along my lash line it's kind
of creative like I said more of a smokey
effect and for when I put my lashes on
made it a bit more blended in and then
I'm taking this highlighting color and
just highlighting my inner corner and
brow bone
then just apply mascara this is the new
L'Oreal mist if you make a volume
mascara to my top and bottom lashes but
to finish off my bottom lash line and
taking that brick color and just taking
a pencil brush and running that along my
lower lash line and just smoking out
connecting it kind of back into the
crease colors that we use and again at
taking that flat brush basically
repeating what we did on the top on the
bottom as well
and just pressing that into my lash line
connecting it back into the crease
colors to really smoke it out so this is
the eye makeup look with just mascara
but I'm going to be extra these lashes
won't be for everyone it's technically
like three sets of lashes it is Ardell
one month fries with demi wispies on the
top and a few individuals I was obsessed
with these and whenever I wear them on
Instagram you guys boys asking what they
are now on to lips I'm going to give you
three lip options and the first one is
the one that I wore on holiday and it is
a nude I think the nudes are just easier
to wear on nights out because they're so
much easier to reapply and this one is
the NYX lip pencil in earth tone the lip
land liquid lipstick in a spotlight and
the Kiko gloss in one 1/3 and then
something a bit more colorful this is
just a lip gloss from Anastasia Beverly
Hills in it candy you guys wanted
something a bit more bright and finally
a red option this is the lip land
cosmetics liquid lipstick in a Brooklyn
I do have a discount code and I'll leave
the link down below I in my previous
video said this was my go-to bright on
holiday that is the finished look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see in the next one bye
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
