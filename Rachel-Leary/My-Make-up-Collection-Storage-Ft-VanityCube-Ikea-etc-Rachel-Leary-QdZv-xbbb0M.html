amount of space I might do like more of
a quorum tour later on for now I'm just
gonna be doing and makeup collection
which is all over there so I'm just
gonna jump right into it so here's a
little overview of my vanity here we've
got my big vanity cube which is
literally the most amazing storage for
makeup ever as you can see it literally
holds just about everything this is the
main beauty of my desk so I'm just gonna
go through this now okay so on the top
one I don't if you can see but it's
split into loads of little compartments
on this side and then it's split here on
this side and it already kind of came
with holes to put lip products in in
this compartment here so here I have
kind of concealers that I use or reach
for day to day the next part I kind of
keep powders that I reach all day today
then at the back I've got kind of my
setting sprays or like Primus I got the
Smashbox primer water Mario Badescu rose

cream from NYX and Cora which you guys
know I absolutely love a matte lipstick
in the shade myself which was a limited
edition lustre that I paid way too much
for on ebay but it's an amazing color
and then to OCC lip tars let's just
stand them up so now I get a move on to
the job it's what the drawer looks like
when you pull it out so it's kind of got
nine compartments in it at the back I've
got my highlighters these ones from
Anastasia which you can get from cult
Beauty via from the UK off so you can
order them from Anastasia if you're from
the US or anywhere else but and so I've

the Kiko - ooh a eyeshadow that kind of
shade and the Starlight one underneath
I've got Riviera in here and people next

which is topaz which is more of like a
shimmery bronzer and then obviously

other face products that I use well in
here is two other face products that I
use a lot so like I said I've got the
Kiko - Oh a eyeshadow the Laura Geller

translucent mineral powder from neve
cosmetics which is amazing for
brightening up under the eyes if you
guys like that kind of a set here I've
got my NARS
luster blusher which it's like one of
the only blushes I actually wear because
I don't really wear a lot of butter so
you guys can tell my videos by really
I'm getting into this one
and then my two phase delay bronzer here
are just two mascaras that I use a lot
as well
I use this one all the time it's my Mac
extended play lash you guys I love this
one then my sister sent me over a
package from America because she lives
there at the moment so and if you're
watching this today but she recently
sent me I was from covergirl stuff so
this is one of their mascara that been
trying out and really really liking
other eye bits and like eye accessories
if that makes sense so here I've got my
Maybelline Color tattoo in the shade
creme de Rose which is basically a dupe
for Mac painterly which like if I also
have in here yeah got Mac for your hair
I've got black track by Mac in there as
well and my NYC liquid liner and then
the makeup revolution Aquifer which is
really good for mixing weird like
pigments and stuff like that to really
bring out their color then in here I
kind of keep my brows tough so I've got
my Sigma stunningly ladylike gel liner
but I like to use that on the ends of my
brows to deepen them up my Mac medium
brown dip brow my two little gimme brows
one from modern power and never from
benefit the L'Oreal artist brow pump and
the Anastasia Beverly Hills clear brow
gel moving on to the next draw is kind

&amp;amp; Glory in hot chocolate
Anastasia pencil in medium brown as well
and my Kiko brow pencil I've got my it
cosmetics mascara my better than sex
mascara and the it cosmetics like
eyelash primer thing which is really
good I'd keep my sellotape at the back
there and then here I've got this
acrylic I shall explore each case from
by all gory as well which is so handy
for storing pigments and glitters and
stuff I use this to store mostly
pigments and a few single eyeshadows but
yeah on to the next door this is kind of
everything to do is cream contouring
highlighting that kind of stuff so I've
got all the Anastasia cream contour kits
I've got light dark and medium there
and I got the two new ones the one in
light and the one in fair I've got the
powder contour kit there from Anastasia
and the bourgeois bronzing primer the
Chanel so late
tan the Kat Von D shade and light
palette the Bobbi Brown foundation stick
in almond the Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow which
technically isn't for highlighting on
contouring but I love that for like a
night out putting on my chest and my
legs my arms and stuff like that so I
put it there to like remind me to use it
and then it's really cool like
contouring and highlighting stick from
neve cosmetics so on one end you've got
that kind of contour shade then here
it's kind of a pencil which i really
like
yeah that's it for that drawer in the
last drawer is where i keep eyes shadow

hills eye shadows that they came out
with their summer collection and then at
the back I've got all the kind of really
colorful makeup geek eyeshadows and then
two blushes that I don't have a thing
for yet so I really like this one so
that's why I keep this in this drawer so
it reminds me to use it but yet that is
it for this beauty of an acrylic storage
I'll leave the link to this one down
below because if you're a makeup lover
like me this is like the most perfect
thing ever to have because this one is
in the style in New York and yet like I
said I'll leave the link to that down
below so just a little overview for like
the rest of my desk like I said I keep
my brushes in these two IKEA pots then
obviously towards the back my dad put
this up for me I think it's meant for
like kitchen utensils and stuff but I
thought it'd be really handy to kind of
just display all my excess brushes on
there you have to excuse my hand weather
it's gross I need to wash it it's got
swatches all over it but yeah so they
just keep all my excess brushes in then
here this sort of thing I think it's
from Muji just basically keeps
accessories or like lip balms or like
stuff that I don't really reach for it
I've just got a pocket of cotton buds
there my bio there when I used to take
my makeup off sometimes then over there
is a lipgloss holder from buyer glory
that I keep the two kind of lip glosses
from Anastasia Beverly Hills that I wear
most of the time and I got the rest of
the liquid lipsticks this isn't all of
them these are just kind of colors that
I reached for the most is they're all
just kept there so here onto my Alex
drawers that they both fit in my corner
like there's on that too the first
drawer this isn't really beauty related
but it's basically where I keep all of
my sunglasses so here are the rest of my
foundations I've got this thing here
that is from an online shop on Amazon
basically that sells acrylic storage if
you search acrylic storage into Amazon
I'm sure it will come up and then this
trough here at the front is from Muji
and this I keep kind of foundations that
are more my shade the kind of side I've
got my Ben Nye banana powder nozzle
daily - pressed powder the Rimmel clear
compaction powder and then for the NYX
mineral sticks in the middle foundation
one kind of one's a bit too light for me
and then in here I kind of keep my more
high street ones then here at the front
it's literally so much and I can't lift
it up but I basically keep like other
like basically concealers that I don't
use all the time I said that is that
drawer and then here my lip drawer so

here is just kind of eye products I
don't really reach for that often -
sticking on the scars that I'm gonna try

can see I like to keep things and browns
as much as I can so the next drawer down
is just deeper and this is what I keep
all my palette here I just keep I prime
