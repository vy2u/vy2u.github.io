so today I'm doing a highly highly
requested video a lot of you guys are
constantly asking me about my skincare
and stuff and like my skin routine so I
thought I would do a video of my
must-have skincare favorites and kind of
explain and show you how I use each one
you find these videos helpful make sure
to give it a thumbs up and let me know
in the comments down below but without
further ado I guess we'll just jump
straight into it so I'll start off with
kind of like my nighttime routine in the
sense that that's probably the most
extensive one and that's when I use the
most products everything that I say I
don't necessarily use every single time
I'll kind of let you know which ones I
do use every time but they kind of mix
and match depending on what my skin's
feeling at the moment and the weather
etc so to start off with I remove my
makeup using makeup wipe this just kind
of gets the basics of and mostly just
removes everything from your skin
I've rave about these Neutrogena ones
that honestly the best I've ever tried
you can't actually get these in the UK
in like your local super drug or boots
or anything like that so I always stock
up when I'm in America or I order mine
from Amazon I'm not really sure why I
love them so much they just feel really
really soothing on the skin it should
get everything off even waterproof
makeup and they're definitely the ones
that I would recommend next up is the
Oscar Renaissance cleansing gel this is
what I use to kind of deep clean and
just kind of cleanse my skin off see as
it says I kind of find cleansers that
aren't that are kind of a moisturizer
bit too intense just because I use a
couple of my own moisturizers for that
and this gel is really hydrating and
really feels really amazing on the skin
and it says to massage on to dry skin
until men--the melted into an oil and
that's why I really love it you know I
always say I really love my skin to feel
hydrated and really I love the feel of
like moist skin and it feeling really
oily so I'm obsessed with this I feel
like in really deep cleans this is also
formulated by like a team of doctors and
scientists and stuff so their
ingredients and it's a pretty beneficial
and it feels amazing on your skin as
well and helps kind of unclog pores and
stuff and I'm going to show you how I
use this with this next tool yeah so the
way I use that it says to massage it
into dry skin so I use
my vanity planet ultimate skin spot to
apply it I've seen so many girls use
knees and I definitely wanted to give it
a go if you're like me and you're super
super lazy I feel like this just kind of
does the job for you and makes things so
much easier and you know it's doing a
really good job it comes in like a
storage travel case as you can see like
this and it holds all three different
types of brushes so when I use my
austere cleansing gel I would do a
couple of pumps onto this and this is
the silicone brush as you can see
obviously it's made of like silicon
silicon and it's been dumbing this
obviously I'll demonstrate how I use it
but the silicone brush actually resists
bacteria and is perfect for like
sensitive or acne skin and I like to
think of myself as kind of having
dehydrated and sensitive skin so this
works amazingly for that I find that I
get really it cooked up here though
using the other brushes there's an
exfoliating brush and a daily cleansing
brush I mean you can alter the depending
on how much of like a deep cleanse that
you really really want so yeah you can
just use this with your favorite
cleanser and it really helps to deep
clean and remove excess makeup that the
wipes may not have gone and because they
kind of like rotate and massaged into
the skin they remove like dead skin
cells and stuff so all around just like
a lot more beneficial than just using
your hand I've seen like so many
different types of things like this but
this one's definitely like the most
affordable one that I've seen and I
definitely recommend this one and if you
check my description to make it even
more affordable for you guys there is a
link down below and purchase this for
only $38 and it's originally 125 so
definitely check it out down below once
I have kind of that use that cleanser
and my skin sparse system to kind of
remove all of the excess makeup I then
like to go in with a bit of the pixie of
glow tonic this is kind of like is it's
definitely a liquid but it's a really
exfoliating liquid it really brings out
the dirt in your skin and I like to just
apply a bit to a cotton pad and just
apply that to anywhere that I've got any
blackheads just maybe on like my nose
and stuff that's where I tend to get
them the most like I said it gently
exfoliates your skin and it kind of
helps to even out your skin tone and
give you a bit more of a brighter
complexion so I really like this and I
see so many people rave about this all
the time if my skin is feeling extra dry
or it's kind of getting more to the
winter and like I said it getting a lot
drier
I
really like the estee lauder advanced
Night Repair Cream this stuff is just
really really intend I don't use this
every day because like I said it's
really intense and I don't want to
overwhelm my skin but when my skin is
feeling extra extra dry I either just
applied this straight from my hands onto
my skin or I mix it in with my nighttime
moisturizer and I just find this to be
super hydrating super nourishing on the
skin and it's quite a luxury product as
well and you can definitely feel that on
your skin so I love this one so I have
to kind of moisturizers that I like to
use at night time sometimes I like to
use both and sometimes I like to use
either or depending on how lazy I feel
if you're lazy like me this is a
lifesaver this is the Clinique Moisture
Surge spray so essentially it's just a
moisturizing spray oh my like I said my
skincare routine and nighttime routine
totally depends on how I feel
some days I might just use wipes and
then just spray this afterwards if I'm
feeling like really I can't be bothered
but I need something it's definitely if
you're lazy with your skin care this is
a really really good liquid moisturizer
to kind of rehydrate your skin after
you've just applied wipes with it this
is really good when you come home like a
night out and you just take off your
makeup and you just and then my final
step would just be a normal nighttime
moisturizer and this is the one from Liz
Earle this one is made for dry sensitive
skins like I said I feel like I've got
dry dehydrated sensitive skin so I need
really good ingredients and the
ingredients in this are phenomenal my
friend amber recommended this to me
it's got like avocado oil in and stuff
it really helps to replace any lost
moisture and I've just found this one to
be really nice that it's kind of the
extent of my nighttime skincare routine
or like some of my must-have products
for my skin before I go to bed I thought
I'd also talk about a couple of masks
that I've been loving I am in love with
the a glam glow hydrating mask as you
can see I've literally finished mine but
anything that feels that super hydrating
on my skin is like a must for me that
you have dry skin or anything I
definitely recommend trying this one out
so this is more of a recent one for me
this is the Peter Thomas Roth travel
sized version of the black purifying
mask black purifying Mosques tend to
have charcoal in or like volcanic ash
that type thing and they're really good
for exfoliating and these
the type of mosques I use when I'm
having a bad skin kind of like week
month or whatever this really helps to
kind of pull out any dirt and dry out
any like spots if you kind of suffer
from really really oily skin and you're
always one you getting clogged pores I
definitely recommend to try this one out
I thought I'd also show you a favorite
body skin care type product and
obviously it is the soap &amp;amp; Glory
righteous butter and this is the diamond
edition if you smelt this you know this
smells incredible I love the smell of
soap &amp;amp; Glory skin care products and this
one just has a really nice pearlescent
finish to it and it just gives you such
a gorgeous glow over your body as well
as really really nourishing your skin
and then finally I'll talk about what I
do in the morning my morning routine
isn't really as intense as some people's
and I've got a few new products I've
been really really loving so depending
if I shower in the morning cuz normally
I shower at nighttime if I shower in the
morning or I'll always 100% wash my face
in the morning I've been really loving
the Murad skin smoothing polish I
literally recently only picked this up
I've seen a massive difference in the
way that my makeup applies and how my
skin feels after I use this because it
is a cleansing polish I can use my skin
spa to apply it and just kind of
exfoliate it onto my skin but I'll
either use that I'll just use my hands
with this one just because it's a bit
thicker yeah it really helps to it
deeply exfoliate so if you picked up
obviously and you've dirt throughout the
night on your face and relieve any kind
of clogged pores and stuff it's also
really good if you've got oily skin
because it has witch hazel in it and
cinnamon extract and that helps to
balance out oils on your skin to kind of
distribute them across your skin so yeah
really good if you've got oily skin as
well then obviously once I Drive my face
whatever and I'm ready to apply makeup
to a fresh face I've been I've been
really loving these products from
benefit it is the instant comeback
facial serum and the firm up eye cream
I've noticed a massive difference in the
way that my primers and my makeup
applies on top of these and these just
really hydrate your skin without leaving
any kind of like wet residue they absorb
really really quickly it's always good
to have an eye cream as well I feel like
my concealer creases less when I got
this on and they both just feel like I
said super hydrating on the skin before
I apply it my makeup because they're
from a makeup brand makeup is designed
to sit well on top of them
definitely can tell with these so that
is it they aren't my must-have skincare
products and kind of like the stage that
I take with my skincare routine
definitely make sure to take up the
offer down below with the vanity planet
skin spa system leaving a lot of money
and it's definitely worth it there's so
many out there on the market and I think
70% off is actually incredible so
