for my long awaited nighttime and
skincare routine I like to start and
finish my evenings always the same with
a cup of tea you guys saw me doing this
in my morning routine as well if you
haven't seen that video I will link it
below but yeah just making a cup of tea
after doing that I wonder over to the
fridge usually and just decide when I
want some sort of snack today I wasn't
too hungry but I was just feeling some
kind of yogurt and strawberries and some
bananas just something like that just to
suppress my sweet cravings
then I'll just take this usually I'll
either take it so far and just relax in
front of the TV or like today I felt
like just chilling out in my room so I
took it upstairs into my room this is
now the time of night where I just like
to lay on my bed to put my fairy lights
on in my room as as relaxing as possible
especially at the moment because I'm in
the middle of doing exams and stuff like
that I just like to keep us relaxed as I
can so I'll just spend hours on my
laptop and phone just watching videos or
online shopping or something like that
this is my favorite websites include
tumblr I like to get inspiration from
there I'll see YouTube that was me
watching it Shani grimmons
boyfriend tag she is probably one of my
favorite youtubers then I'll just like
to go on my phone I'm all obviously
check Twitter I'm at Rachael underscore
Leary if you wanted to tweet me I'm
really a lot more active at replying on
Twitter I don't know what it is but I do
interpret your comments too but yeah so
you should check that out so I'll just
like to browse one of my social media so
I'll go on Instagram where it's at
Rachael Erie if you wanted to follow me
on there if you know me as well you also
know that I love vine I don't post
anything on there but I just love
spending hours just looking at other
people people's like that one and stuff
like that then I like to check snapchat
now this is my personal snapchat but so
obviously I do have one but I didn't
know if me making a snapchat for you
guys would be something you'd be
interested in let me know in the
comments below
then after a lot of procrastinating I
like to get up and take my makeup off
before a shower so this is my skincare
and makeup remover routine I like to
take my makeup off using and I like to
do my eye makeup up using a specific eye
makeup remover this is the pro one from
Mac but I also really like the Sephora
one and the one from Gagne I think it is
that's purple then I think this is what
a lot of you want to know when I take my
makeup off and what's made the most
difference in my skin is mixing a makeup
remover this is the one from soap &amp;amp;
Glory with a few drops of bio oil bio
oils designed to help get rid of any
skeins and really hydrate the skin and I
used to get a lot of like little spots
on like the side of my face and just
like color pigmentation and ever since
I've used fire oil to help take off my
makeup I find that's all gone so that's
a little secret for you then I like to
use my Garnier micellar water just to
get rid of any leftover makeup or dirt
which surprisingly there normally is up
quite a lot as you'll see
next off is a shower in before having a
shower I sometimes like to do a face
mask so I'm just washing my face so it's
all clean and I like to a face mask
before shower because they always
recommend oversee that you wash it off
so it's just easy for me to wash off in
the shower this is the Korres
pomegranate cleansing mask I absolutely
love this it smells exactly like a glam
glow mask does exactly the same as a
glam glow mask and is only like seven
pounds I'll even link to that in the
description below but recently I've been
getting into masks just cuz I've been
fighting it's making my skin a lot
smoother and cleaner and I just love the
look that it gives my skin the mask I
recommend you leave on for 10 minutes so
in the meantime I thought I'd show some
of my in shower essentials this is the
Herbal Essences hello hydration shampoo
and conditioner the soap and glory at
bitumen sea facial wash the body shop
strawberry shower gel which you can tell
has been at muchly loved and i need to
get a new one and sometimes if i'm
prepping for fake tan but i will do that
at an upcoming fake tanning routine i
like to use a coffee scrub and this is
from the brand jealous and it's got
hints of coconut in as well so it smells
amazing then before the shower i like to
listen to music so while I'm in the
shower I put something to listen to so
I'll just pick a playlist put it on
shuffle and get in the shower
after the shower I like to get in my big
pink fluffy dressing-gown and obviously
do my teeth then recently I've been
really loving the nip and fab dragon's
blood fix pumping mask and what I like
to do is apply a thick layer to my skin
and you can either leave it on for 10
minutes or it says you can leave on
overnight for a really intense like
hydrating treatment which is how I
personally like to use it and then
obviously just push it up in the morning
then I just like to get into my pajamas
and crawl into bed that's then followed
by another long session of just going
over my social medias you guys know the
drill I'm sure everyone does the same
but yet so that was my nighttime and
skincare routine I hope my skincare
routine was up to standards I know a lot
of people requested it and I kind of put
off ages because I didn't really think
is anything special but I just thought
I'd show you what I do but that's
everything so I really hope you guys
enjoyed the video give this video a
thumbs up for more routine type style
videos and let me know in the comments
below what you would like to see next
but thank you so much for watching and
until next time I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
