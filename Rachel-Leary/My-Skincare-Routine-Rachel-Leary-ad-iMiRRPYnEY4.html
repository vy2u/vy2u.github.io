today I am bringing you a highly
requested video of my skincare routine
and to do this I've teamed up with sip
drunk and Olli bring you and show you
the skincare routine that I've been
using at the moment that a lot of you
guys
sinter things have worked because you
guys have been asking to see a video if
you guys want to check out their
products they are exclusive to see the
drug so make sure to check out sooth
drug calm obviously if you have a super
chutney you make sure to go in there and
check them out
so let me get started and show you the
stuff so for this video I do want to
wear a huge amount of makeup just
because it is a skincare routine I
wanted to show you what my skin was
looking like at the moment so on my skin
I am currently wearing the only two and
one hydration and BB cream I think it
comes in two shades the shade medium
which I haven't my skin at the moment
and the shade fair so for the more kind
of colder months and stuff when I'm not
gonna be wearing as much and not as much
Sun and I'll probably be ranked a more
fair shape but at the moment I have two
shade medium on you know anything about
only you know they're an incredible
skincare brand and what they've done is
mixed their skincare with a bit of Max
Factor foundation really hydrating BB
cream which gives you a really healthy
flow and kind of really helps to even
out the skin tone
somedays I can't be bothered to buy a
lot of makeup or I'm just going out for
like a few minutes or just something
like that this has been my go-to product
to throw on also because it's got kind
of the Olay moisturiser enriched in it
it's that's why I mentioning it as part
of a skincare routine because it's still
hydrating my skin and give me a really
gorgeous glow which I love
before applying a foundation or like the
BB cream for instance you need a really
good base otherwise your foundation is
never going to look as good as you want
it to so the one I've been loving at the
moment is the only two-in-one hydration
and flawless blur so this basically has
that instant smoothing effect the skin
which is ideal before applying any
makeup base and like it says in the name
it's still got that hydrating boosters
you've got drier or kind of normal skin
like me it's perfect for giving you a
really moisturized face before applying
your makeup and one of the best things
about it is
absorbs really quickly so you're not
going to find that your foundation
slipping about or your BB Creams
clipping about on your face it absorbs
super quick but still it's giving you
all the benefits of the moisturize like
other moisturizers but it's still the
perfect base foundation when it comes to
taking off makeup recently I found
myself being a lot lazier I used to use
like micellar water and like 750 cotton
pads to take off but recently I've
discovered the be pure micelle or white
so these wipes are super moisturizing I
find to be really big as well compared
to some other ones I've years so it's
super important to cleanse your skin and
these wipes really help to cleanse and
tone and give your skin that really
refreshed look so they're really like
wet as well so I find that they last
like I used to use one makeup wipe to
remove my makeup and I think if that
makes sense if I feel like I just need
one so they lost a really long time as
well they're super good at turning your
skin to I think it said something about
how it's got like a pH balance formula
so it really helps to give leave your
skin really smooth which is something
that I am all about I love my skin
looking as smooth as I can and I finally
feel really good to my skin after
removing your makeup it can be quite
abrasive on your skin sometimes because
you've been doing all that kind of
circular motion so it's super important
to moisturize and I have to kind of
moisturize that I've been music the
first one is the Eau de two and one
hydration and radiant glow so this like
it says gives more of a radiant glow so
it gives more of a sunkissed healthy
looking skin and moisturizing effect to
it as well so you're still getting the
key benefits from moisturizer
really soothing your skin then also
you're building up a nice healthy glow
even in the winter time I still have to
maintain some sort of glow to my skin so
this one I find to be really subtle and
not too intense and give me a really
nice glow underneath my foundation and
plus it has SPF 15 in it which is ideal
because you don't want to be getting
wrinkling on your odor and SPF helps
protect you from the Sun the other
moisturizer I've been loving is the
Bondi science every day gradual Italian
milk so this one's a bit more of a
thicker moisturizer so maybe on days
that I find my skin to be super dry but
I still want to have a bit of life in my
skin I knew something like this I also
take this one down onto my neck as well
just because I find the color to be a
bit stronger the only one is amazing at
giving that kind of subtle glow that
kind of is that you can filled up like
this when I find to be a bit more of a
intense color so I'll use that kind of
more on my neck as well as my face
sometimes and it's bit more of a thick
of moisturizer so this one I use on days
where I feel my skin's a bit more tired
so a new kind of part to my skincare
routine has been to include an eye cream
I've never I've never really thought
about using an eye cream and recently I
went to the skincare spa day and it was
choose this amazing idea on me and it
made such difference so I thought I
wanted to get one of my own the one I
picked up was the be energised eye cream
so what this does it's a pretty cooling
formula which really helps to get rid of
any dark under-eye circles there really
helps to bar frighten and hydrate
underneath your eyes and I found
elephants using this my under eye
concealer pryzen a lot more smoothly and
I don't feel like it gets cakey or like
it creases as much since using an eye
cream which obviously is a bonus but I'm
doing a lot makeup and stuff like that
all the time and I just apply this at
nighttime just I mean the tips of my
fingers and just dab it underneath my
eyes I personally don't suffer from that
much dark under-eye circles but I do
find that when I'm really tired like
this this really helps me to feel a bit
more await the next morning like I
mentioned earlier with the whites I find
it really important to cleanse your skin
to make sure you're getting rid of all
the dirt and all the dry skin that you
might have on your face so either a
nighttime you're buckin bothered almost
the time it's in the morning I like to
use the be revealed
glycolic cleansing peel I think this is
so basically just apply it to your face
leave it on for two to three minutes
kind of avoid the eye area but I like to
take it down onto my neck as well so see
I tried a lot to make my neck I just
want to make sure I'm getting rid of all
the dirt in case I missed someone taking
off my makeup and it does I think yeah
it does come with a cloth that you can
use to kind of help wipe off but like
you can just use a flannel or something
like that and it's ideal for kind of dry
and oily and combination
literally anyone can use this and I just
find this really helps to brighten up my
complexion and give me a really youthful
it says to leave on for three minutes
but sometimes what I like to do is kind
of put this on now I like do my teeth or
like something else and then like I wish
I've just kind of passed the time so
either in the morning or at night time I
think it said you should use like two to
three evenings a week but in the morning
if I know I'm not gonna be wearing a lot
of makeup that day I'm like you said
then and I find this has really helped
especially on the sides of my face right
bad I had the most texture to my skin
just to kind of really buff away all the
dead skin cells so I've been really
loving this as well they are all the
products I've been loving recently and
coming up with the ideal skin care
routine for me I've been using this for
a month or so I've been loving it's the
one that I've found to work the most
effectively on my skin so I've
definitely found it to be really
important to make sure to maintain a
daily facial cleansing routine and the
products I've mentioned especially the
ole a two-in-one rage I've found to
provide everything my skin needs to stay
healthy and well hydrated so if you guys
