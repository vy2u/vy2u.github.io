to start my morning routine I don't like
to really sleep in so I set my alarm for
9:30 and have a second one
at 9:45 to ensure that I get up in time
then of course I lay in bed for a while
checking emails and all my social medias
and what YouTube it is before getting up
and opening my windows and legs and
light into the room
next I have to do my teeth especially
before makeup because I don't want to
brush off anything that I put on my lips
afterwards and I like to use the oral-b
3d white toothpaste in case you were
interested please excuse the difference
in color between my face and neck I do
always say my next different color it's
just like that because I exfoliate my
face a lot more often then I just like
to rinse my face with warm water to wake
me up and clean my face
next is breakfast I like to make myself
either a breakfast tea or a green tea I
especially like the pineapple and
grapefruit green tea from Twinings if
you've never tried it it is stone
refreshing and delicious but today I
went for a simple breakfast tea I don't
have any sugar in mine just a splash of
milk and always have to leave the spoon
in there I'm not really sure why for
food I tend to be pretty basic sorry if
you were expecting some avocado on toast
or something but I'm just gonna stick to
my Special K with chocolate and add some
frozen strawberries on the top
after I've eaten I'll take myself and my
tea back upstairs and do my makeup and
today I wanted to do something a bit
bold and dramatic but feel free to do
whatever you have time for and what's
comfortable to add some moisture back
into my skin I'm using my mac fix+
then priming using my L'Oreal Lumi
magique primer to prep my skin for
foundation
I'm doing my eyes first in case of any
fallout from the shadows so I'm going in
with my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot as
always all over my lid and then to set
this I'm using the shadow buttery from
the anastasia beverly hills artists
palette you can use any skin tone shadow
or face powder next I'm mixing creme
brulee and chickadee from makeup geek to
create a warm transition shade in the
crease using my Sigma e-40 brush as
always and then next I'm taking this
warm brown shade from the Sigma
smokescreen palette and just further
deepening my crease you guys know the
drill next I'm taking this shimmery
peach shade all over my lid I'm kicking
the eyes relatively basic because I'm
gonna go for a bright lips I want the
focus to remain there and now I'm taking
baby I'm a staff in the Anastasia
Beverly Hills palette again on the outer
third and blending it into the crease
with this deep brown shade from the
Sigma palette if you missed any of that
all product info will be down below to
give my eyes a clean edge I'm taking my
Sephora eye makeup remover and a cotton
tip and going for my outer corner
towards my eyebrows to create a really
clean at cut line I'm then doing a
simple wing with my Sigma wicked gel
liner and a signal winged liner brush
you've seen me do this a hundred times
but this is the end result I went for
then apply my mascara use whatever one
you want for this look I'm gonna be
applying lashes as well so I'm just
giving them a light coat
the lashes I'll be using are from the
lure and the style winging it amplifies
the cat eye effect from the liner and
the eye shadow since our skin has had
time to soak up the primer I'm going
straight in with my Mac face and body
foundation since you guys prefer it when
I use a lighter weight Foundation and
I'm just buffing that into my skin as I
mentioned before or products details
will be in the description bar below as
well as shades I'm then highlighting
under my eyes with my mac mineralize
concealer what I like most about this is
the applicator just because it lets me
clean up my liner even further really
precisely but I then will buff it in
with my morphe gtex brush
I then did my brows I was getting a
stronger brow today so I use my dip brow
in taupe to warm up my skin I'm using
this new shimmer cream in the shade
sultry in the springtime I love the
appearance of creams on the skin I just
feel they blend a lot more naturally and
feel it's so much more lightweight on
the skin to further bronze and set the
cream I'm using my Mac mineralize
skinfinish in dark then to set my
concealer I'm using another mineralized
skinfinish but this one is in the shade
light
I'll I wanted to use something with a
pink undertone to kind of act like a
blusher as well but still give me a
fresh dewy appearance so I'm using this
Sigma loose shimmer in the shade lush on
a Sigma tapered highlighter brush back
to the eyes I'm taking that initial warm
brown shade from the Sigma palette and
running it under my eyes on a pencil
brush
then I'm applying my favorite bottom
lash mascara from Mac and then
highlighting my inner corner with the
shade shimmer shimmer from makeup geek
on a pencil brush as well
because this I shadow look is so
versatile you can basically use any lip
color you want and I just felt like
using a bright coral this is electrical
for Anastasia Beverly Hills now for hair
my hair is naturally curly but it
definitely needed some control so to
curl my hair I'm gonna be using my nume
titan-3 set what is amazing about this
set is that it has interchangeable
barrels in a variety of sizes depending
on the look you want to go for today I
use the thickest barrel to achieve more
beachy and loose looser curls and it
also comes with argan oil as well which
is amazing to soothe out my frizz I do
have coupon codes for you guys so you
can get your hands on them too to get
$100 off any curling set and a free
argan oil use the code peeps or 40% off
any Hot Tools excluding hair care
accessories and seasonal catalog again
with a free argan oil with the code
chocolate bunny all information will be
in the description bar below if you are
interested I said before I'm gonna be
using the thickest barrel today so let's
get started to begin I'm gonna be
separating my hair there'll be three
layers in total and then just rushing
through my hair to reduce any previous
curls and then applying a pea-sized
amount of the nume argan oil to suit out
my frizz
then applying a heat defense spray this
one is just from big sexy hair and
smells it's super yummy
I'm taking my nume wand and the thickest
barrel I've set it to 200 degrees and
I'm taking medium size chunks of hair
and holding it for around 30 seconds and
doing it in an outward motion the set
does also come up with gloves to protect
your hands if you're interested but I
was clearly feeling rebellious but that
is one side done and that's the other
side done again just using the same
technique as before I then tie that
layer back into a ponytail so my hair
isn't getting all mixed up with the
other layers and then it take another
layer down again brushing out the frizz
and smoothing it with the oil I then
repeat the same motion of wrapping the
hair in an outwards direction and
holding it for 20 to 30 seconds and this
is the finish result of this layer I
then at take down at the final layer and
repeat everything I've just shown you
the previous two times
but this is the finished result I
absolutely love the appearance this
color gives my hair so definitely make
the most of those codes and check out
new me site so with hair and makeup done
it's time for my outfit I decided to go
for a basic high neck black cameo from
new look a tribal style necklace from
bershka leopard print Topshop jeans and
some rings also from Topshop and Urban
Outfitters but that's everything guys I
hope you liked my finished look and
