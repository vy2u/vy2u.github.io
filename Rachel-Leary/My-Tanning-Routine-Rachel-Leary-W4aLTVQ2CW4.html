today I'm doing my long-awaited tanning
routine video this is just a few steps I
like to take in order to get the best
looking time I can you obviously don't
have to use the exact same products as
me whether or not you just take a few
drips from it or just learn something
new that's the whole point of the video
so I hope you enjoy and let's get
started the first thing I like to do is
get rid of any other tan I made
previously hat on or any dead skin and I
like to use a coffee scrub this one is
pink jealous body I will leave their
details down below this one smells of
coffee and coconuts it smells absolute
amazing and I just rub this all over my
body and it says it's best to leave it
on for 10 minutes and then the officers
give notice ellipsis about that is what
I did after
after exfoliating with the scrub I'd
then like to use my loving time
exfoliating NIT just to get any bits
that I miss and you guys we pleased to
know that loving tannic now chips to the
UK but so many of you guys ask me about
it I'll leave all the information down
below in terms of outstripping rates and
stuff like that and I just like to clean
my body so I just take my shower gel and
also I take this opportunity to shape as
well just because having a nice smooth
legs and stuff like that just a bride
makes the town apply better basically so
I just clean my body and then just shave
my legs this is just what I look like
after exfoliating I will now I always
like start on my arms that's like the
hardest bit I drink and trying to get
off old tan I did get most of it off but
now on to the application and I'm using
is the loving time deluxe bronzing
mousse in dark this is on a seat one of
the best times I've ever used it's such
a natural color and such a really
blendable consistency I've never had any
problem to the end nervous and not
paying me to say that but I'm using a
brush to get the smooth application to
my chest which is a tip I picked up from
Mike Jackson hill and density I think
and for the rest of my body I just
applied the move for my loving turn it
you guys to get all of these for free
with the code rachel with any moose
purchase you can use any mitt that you
want I actually like to use too
personally I like to use this one also
for the fake bake I don't apply any
product to it I just use it to kind of
get any excess product and smooth
everything out so normally leave it for
like eight hours but I know we like to
do it overnight so this is what edit
work in the morning but then I just like
to shower off I literally just stand in
the shower I don't use a sponge or
anything like that
then when I get out I just Pat myself
dry it with the towel then I'm going in
with a moisturizer you can use anything
that you want it doesn't have to be a
graduate on one I just use at one
there's kind of abundant formula in it
just to kind of add to the tan and this
one is from elements and it smells
incredible and leaves such a nice glow
to the skin so I'll leave a link to that
down below if you're interested and
that's the end of my telling you guys I
really hope you enjoyed it I just put my
coat on and my makeup and this is the
kind of natural looking time I brought
fur and connect and guys I'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
