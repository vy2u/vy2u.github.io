so I'm really really excited if than
this beneath you guys I don't know why I
came up with it the other day and I
thought this would be a really good idea
especially for this time of year when
you might be looking for Christmas
presents for one of your friends that's
really into makeup or something like
that um and as you can tell by the title
it is my top 10 Mac lip combinations so
this is going to be three lip products
each time I'm going to go from a nude
down to a really dark lip and like I
said three lip products so I'm going to
be using a pencil a lipstick and a lip
gloss I'll show you what it looks like
with just the lipstick and the lip
pencil and then with the gloss on the
top because not everyone loves a glossy
lip and some of the ones I don't
actually use a gloss in them either
but yeah like I said not everyone likes
a glossy lip but when it comes to nudes
and pinks and stuff like that I love a
glossy lip so all the products I am
using like I said are Mac and I think
most of them are permanent so you'll be
able to get your hands on them any time
of the year I know some shades are
really popular and might be sold out
around this time of the year but I
thought this would be a good idea to
just want to show you my favorite Mac
lip combinations because sometimes it
can be quite intimidating going in and
seeing all the lipstick so they've got
understand all the pencils they've got
all the lip glosses cuz they've got so
so so many so these are just my top ten
and like I said quite a good gift idea
if you didn't know what to get anyone
and you know that into their makeup and
start a lip combination is I really keep
present like couple of things from Mac
and that I look good on their lips and
just as a skin reference obviously not
all these lip combinations are going to
look the same on if you're a lot paler
than me or a lot darker than me arm as a
reference I am about an NC 32 and NC 35
in a Mac foundation and these are what
these colors look on me and these are my
favorites
I just thought I would share them with
you I feel like I've rambled on enough
but yeah so let's go ahead and get
started so to start off with one of my
favorite
Nayla beige year nude lip combos is a
lecturer pro long wear lip pencil
creme de nude lip gloss and instant gold
luster glass I'm gonna try and do a
swatches of all of them the Electra
pencil is a really nice wearable baiji
brown shade it's kind of got a yeah like
I said like a brown undertone to it but
if you guys were like stripped down or
oak or anything like that it's a bit
more of a warmer Brown than that those
two a bit more cooler in tone so that's
the pencil and I like to pair this like
I said with creme de nude lipstick so
like I said creme de nude it's kind of
in the name it's a nude it's really
creamy it's a cream Sheen lipstick so
they're really glossy on the lips but
they're not as glossy as say a luster or
a frosted finish it's really comfortable
to wear as well and I find that these
blend really nicely so you might be
thinking that that pencil is way too
dark for that lipstick but when I try it
on I'll show you what I mean and they do
blend super easily and then to top it
off I love a glossy nude lip and this
color is gorgeous this is a luster glass
and instant gold it looks like that so
it's pretty clear in color but it's got
really a gorgeous gold reflex to it so
those three together
I will obviously add clips in now but
those three together look absolutely
beautiful
moving on it to a slightly pinky nude I
really love subculture pencil flesh port
lipstick and sugar rimmed dazzle bar
you'll see throughout this video
dazzle glosses are a recurring theme
because they are hands-down my favorite
gloss they are like the glitter areas
gloss and I just love what a glittery
lip looks like looks like when the light
hits at your lips just look so full and
so plump and I just think I get captures
attention and just looks beautiful
so a flash ball I think is their paler
satin lipstick that they do so satins
kind of the next one to a matte finish
it's not completely matte but it's not
as glossy as like a cream machine or
anything like that so it's really a
gorgeous texture and
blend super nicely with pencils one of
my favorite pencils of all time just
because it goes with literally
everything is subculture it looks like
that and like I said flash port is
really a pair you do have to make sure
that you blend out these two together
but subculture I wear that with like
honey love blankety it's such an amazing
pencil if you don't if you want to get
your friend a nude pencil and you're not
sure which nude subculture is always a
winner I think it goes with loads of
skin types and then sugar and it's a
super pale pink so it looks gorgeous
over these two like I said this is still
a nude combination but it's just got a
bit more of like a paler pink undertone
to it rather than the kind of brown Eve
light beige you need kind of colors
moving along still in the kind of nude
but we're kind of going a bit more
Orange EPG this is one of my fav
mination it is boldly bare lip pencil
hue a glazed lipstick and moth flame
dazzle glass so this is like I said a
bit more of a peachy nude a glazed
lipstick it's definitely more of a wash
of color so you don't want to go too
heavy-handed with your lip pencil just
because it's not as strong as a pigment
to be able to blend outside with fall
deeper pencil is more of the woman nude
shade so they do go together
but you just have to make sure that
you're slightly softer with the color
and the monster flame it does alas is
absolutely stunning
definitely one of my favorites it just
adds a bit of a warmer glitter to your
lip so that is what those three look
like we have the dazzle glass at the top
pencil hair and the lipstick there that
kind of shows you that it's a bit more
of a peach but like all the other ones I
will show you what that looks like on my
lips now a couple of lipsticks that
would look gorgeous in this combination
I just don't own them is Shanghai spice
I girl both look amazing with this gloss
and pencil combination as well getting a
bit more darker ish and a bit more pinky
this is one of my favorite pink a lip
combinations I do tend to stay away from
a bright pink lip so I haven't really
got a really bright piglet in this video
some people can rock a bright big lip
and I
that looks beautiful at the time I feel
like it just makes me look like a Barbie
doll and there's nothing wrong with that
but for me it's just not one of my
favorite looks so this one is a bit more
wearable for me personally and it is
double time at pro longwear pencil
Mitchell are the new ones that they came
out with so it's still a bit of a nude
but it's more of a deeper nude a pink
honey love lipstick which is one of my
favorite lipsticks of all time I work
with so many I'm just showing you what
it looks like in this combination and
baby sparks at dazzle glass so this is
what they look like swatch on my hand
this is baby sparks dazzle glass and
love lipstick and a double time a pencil
I'll show you what they look like on my
lips now but this one is kind of more of
a deeper nude then obviously the first
couple that I showed you so this one
kind of is a bit more like a safer
option the new pro longwear pencils the
shades that they came up with are
amazing double-time and cultured are
defo of my favorite ones but yeah like I
said this can be padded any you could
switch out honey love for velvet teddy
or spirit lipstick or cherish or
something like that that would look
amazing with this pencil and gloss too
but yeah that's what this one looks like
it's one of my favorites if any of my
work friends are watching they will know
that this is I think it's one of all of
our favorite lipstick combinations so
this is stripped down pencil Viva Glam
to lipstick and sugar rimmed dazzle
glass so this one I'd still classify as
a nude it's just a bit more of a cool
tone brownian nude stripped down pencil
is hands-down defo like one of my
favorite lip pencils to help anything
wear this with flash pore wear this with
cherish wear this with honey love stuff
like that looks amazing I'm just showing
you what it looks like with this one
because but this is definitely just one
of the first lip combinations so the
Pens on the lip stick together is quite
dark but then it looks I like to lighten
it slightly with the sugar around it as
well so as you'll see
but the main thing about this is one
it's such well I love it as a lip
combination anyway but Viva Glam
lipstick I don't know if you guys are
aware but a hundred percent of the
proceedings of Viva Glam lipsticks go to
the MAC AIDS Fund which is one of the
biggest charities and does so so so much
a hundred percent of proceedings go to
this so if you wanted to get this
combination for someone as a present
know that you're doing a good deed by
buying the lipstick it's such a gorgeous
color anyway to wear on its own
especially around this time of year with
cooler tones coming into fashion instead
of maybe going for like a darker lip a
cool tone nude is really install at the
moment and I am in love with this
combination so there's the pencil
there's Viva Glam - and there is sugar
and so this is the only kind of pink
combination I really like it's
definitely a pink pink but it's not like
super super bright and it is edge to
edge lip pencil creme Cup lipstick and
rags-to-riches dazzle glass so that is
what they look like swatch on my hand
there is rags-to-riches there is creme
Cup and there is edge to edge edge is
definitely a lot more Pinker than I
think it's showing up on camera but yet
this is one of the Pink's I really liked
where creme Cup is such a gorgeous color
creme Cup and rags-to-riches just on its
own without the lip pencil I think for
maybe someone that's quite young is a
really really gorgeous baby pink
combination so if you know someone that
likes Pink's um this is one of my
favorite ones and if they have a similar
skin tone to me I'll show you obviously
what it looks like on my lips now and I
really really like this one but like I
said I don't really wear a lot of Pink's
just cuz I don't want to look like a
Barbie doll but I really like this one
so next I have my kind of purple lip and
it's not like bright bright purple I
like to pair kind of cooler deeper nudes
with the kind of brighter lip pencil and
lip gloss so my idea of my favorite kind
of purple is heroine lip pencil blankety
lipstick and a fun - happy
as dazzle glass so this for me is a bit
more of a wearable purple blanket II
like I said and if you guys know
blankety is a nude lipstick but it's
really cool and blending out with the
pencil um is what I do to create the
purple looking shade because obviously
heroin and fantabulous at both of really
a bright colors but I definitely feel
blank she's got that perfect undertone
which is why you can get away with it
and I just think fantabulous dazzle
glass is like the funnest dazzle glass
ever I think it's gorgeous and it's got
a bit of pigment to it so it helps to
kind of really add a bit more purple to
the nude lipstick so there's heroin lip
pencil there's blankety and there's
fantabulous and I will show you what
they look like on my lips now so as you
can see um it does take a bit more
blending but I'm lipstick if you really
wanted to go bright bright purple that
would look good with the pencil and the
lip gloss as well is up the amp or
violetta or flat out fabulous or even
heroine lipstick obviously goes with the
lip pencil now the next three I show you
I instead of it the next thing I show
you is just a lip pencil and a lipstick
just because there are a lot more
brighter colors and with bright colors I
feel it's quite risky going quite glossy
if you're eating or drinking and stuff
you want them to last the longest time
and glosses can kind of not necessarily
ruin that but makes it a bit more
difficult so the next one I'm showing
you is my favorite bright orange
combination and that is high-energy
pencil and Miley Cyrus a second Viva
Glam that she bought out so these two
are like a match made in heaven they're
like the same exact color so it's not an
ombre like a lot of the other lip
combinations I showed you and this one
looks amazing on any skin tone from
whether or not you're super pale to
super dark this kind of orange looks
phenomenal
I love it when I'm a bit more tanned the
also the Gloucester mighty came out with
is well looks incredible on top of this
one so yeah this is like my favorite
orange combination because it's not too
out there orange it's bit more
a red-orange so that is the lipstick and
that is the pencil I said this is a
matte finish so last is super long time
on the lips and I think perfect for this
kind of time of year when people are
looking at like reds and deeper colors
this is like an alternative for like a
Christmas party or something and oranjee
red looks gorgeous with like a gold
smokey eye or like a minimal on the eye
and does that statement yep so yeah
that's what that one that looks like
second-to-last is probably one of my
favorite combinations and it's like the
perfect red lip and that is ruby blue
lipstick and cherry pencil I feel like
nook is famous for this lipstick and
pencil the combination is just gorgeous
it's slightly more of a cooler red I'd
say bit more of a blue undertone to it
but it's definitely one of my favorite
Reds ever read is I could go to lip for
me like I said having blond hair and
blue eyes red is one of my favorite
colors to wear as in clothing wise as
well as on my lips if I ever need a
bright statement lip I'll always go for
a red I feel like it just complements my
skin and everything and this one is
definitely one of my faves so this is
cherry pencil and that is Ruby boo
I think Ruby food like I said is one of
Mac's best or it might be Mac's
best selling lipstick it's gorgeous from
being like I said any skin type really
pale too really dark boy and anything in
between it looks gorgeous yeah that's
what that one looks like and finally my
last lip combination is miss diva Pro
Longwear pencil and diva lipstick so
around this time of year this is
probably one of the most popular kind of
color choices and dark burgundy lips
always always always come round into
fashion this time of year and this
combination is like my favorite again
like the previous to it they are both
the pencil and the lipstick together
create a really nice matte finish
I think especially with darker shades
you want you don't want the risk of them
smudging at all because it's there the
most difficult thing to get off ever so
keeping the mat just ensures that
they're quite dry and reduces the risk
of smudging that's what they look like
really really gorgeous like burgundy
wine plummy colors like I said amazing
and brilliant Rend at this time of year
so if you were looking maybe you know
your friends getting into makeup and
they like following trends or they
really like a dark lip this one is
definitely one of my favorites and that
is what this one looks like on my lips
so that is it for this video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and maybe I'll
have discovered a new Mac lip
combination that you liked or potential
gift idea for someone that you know
really likes makeup or is just getting
into makeup or just really likes MAC
lipsticks or Mac makeup in general this
video is not sponsored by Mac or
anything like that I just love Mac as a
brand and their lip products so I
thought I would share and I get a lot of
questions about lip combinations and
stuff like that so yeah I just thought I
