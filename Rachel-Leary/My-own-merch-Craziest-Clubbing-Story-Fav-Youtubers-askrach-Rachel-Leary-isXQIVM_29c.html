earlier today I asked you guys to ask me
questions on Twitter with the hashtag
ask Rachel because I feel like I haven't
done a Q&amp;amp;A in forever and I thought I've
been going away and I've got to film a
few videos I'll do a a question and
answer for you guys see I'm just gonna
go to the hashtag and go through the
questions that you guys ask me that
wasn't a specific theme for this one I
said make them kind of like fun and
interesting few of them get asked a few
times so if I answer someone's question
and you answered that question it was
only because I saw it first if that make
sense so I would try and answer as many
as I can so the first question was from
ex Mia Alice and she said favorite photo
you have on your phone okay favorite
photo in what sense like funny maybe I
have so many memes on my phone and some
of them I like my favorite photos but
okay so I like narrowed it down I've
done like a few so I like this one of me
and my friends just because it was a
night out that we went on it was really
nice picture and we never really get
like a group picture standing up so I
like this one that's my friend Alex
Besson and Chloe I really like this one
of me and Han because I know I think she
looks phenom and yeah it's just
a nice a nice high quality picture of us
together
I love this one of my friend Alex cuz
can you just mmm he's like one of the
funniest people I know on the scene he
just looks hilarious in this one I have
this one if ja rak can you guys know
jack I'm sorry dude that makes me laugh
I had this one of me and my friend Lucy
and I really like this picture as well
bi they're just a mother few of my
favorite ones I've got like other funny
ones and stuff but you know we can't be
sure on how much my go to I look at the
moment on a see if I have to be really
quick and I want to do something that
looks nice I will just do a bronze
rounded eye and I'll use the for say the
sales pigment from neve cosmetics and
like a few warm colors in the crease
some branded lashes that's like my
favorite favorite favorite look to do it
and i always do it on holiday
pretty much my go-to holiday makeup i
think i did a video on it I'm not sure
but yeah that is definitely my go-to I
look forever
Ashley Rene Rene asks what is your crazy
as a clubbing story um
probably the time me and a group of
friends went to Brighton for New Year's
we drove down there and like parked in
an underground car park and then
obviously like we drove there like in
our clothes that we were going out
clubbing in and then we like slept in
our cars like after that night out like
we didn't think really think about
accommodation or like getting back so
stuck they were drinking and stuffing it
was New Year's that we obviously weren't
gonna drink and drive but yeah like so
he slept in our cars in the underground
car park and yeah like the general whole
duration of the night was really like
weird as well now I think about it so
many of my friends just to get to in the
sense they were just like no one could
see no one could walk it was it was how
New Year's should be spent it was a good
time they've YouTuber at the moment I
really really love ELISA actually like
I've only recently found I think
actually been subscribed to her for a
while but then kind of like forgot to
watch her videos like I just subscribe
cuz I was like she looks like something
I want to watch that I will watch her
later but I follow her on Twitter as
well and she's so funny
and she's so original she comes up with
so many of like new looks and ideas like
she has this mystery makeup Monday thing
and I think that's so invented and so
cool such a little like personal thing
for your channel so I'll link her down
below and you can tell her that I said
hey Solly underscore Jade said faith
thing about doing YouTube and I love you
love you too and my favorite thing about
doing YouTube is kind of making your own
schedule and you're kind of like your
own boss so that make sense unless you
have like a full day of doing things you
can kind of go up when you want and yeah
you give yourself breaks and schedule
things this you want to I think the
whole freedom of it all is probably the
best bit besides paying with makeup all
day and that being my job to know I mean
so yeah I probably just say the freedom
of time sometimes I mean I have busy
days and like meetings and stuff but on
days where you just kind of like planned
to film a video and it's not too hectic
it's like a nice day when you think
about like what other people have to get
up and do that work underscore Olivia
Hall said if you could only have one
noodle
Glaus which one would it be snapchat fan
oh my god I mean it she sat here like
looking at them all okay it would it
would probably have to be either Kylie
so cute or Marc Jacobs Moonglow xix
Caitlyn said favorite moment of 2016 so
far probably there's a few I think I
mean hitting my milestones have been
incredible Kylie Jenner liked my
Instagram picture ashley tisdale made me
her woman crush Wednesday
nikkietutorials followed me on Instagram
all the events and stuff I get to go to
and experiences with Hanna and stuff
there's a few things coming up that I
think will be the best moments for me
for example I'm going to be fest with
Han I'm going to New York in September
with Amy's makeup books and Maybelline
for New York Fashion Week which is gonna
be incredible I can't believe it
obviously I'll be building that and
everything and I think that will
probably be a massive highlights me and
yeah I mean there's been a few things
and I've been truly blessed this year so
I can't think of just one the same girl
said would you rather have balls hanging
from your chin or have a five inch tail
that wags every time you get excited I
think wait is the tail for my chin and
it works or just having a tail cuz I
think I'd rather have to tell them my
gosh you guys Hale LWT I think that's
how you say it says what was your fav
and least fav subject at school so my
favorite subject at school was probably
a little bit of psychology maybe just
because I think that's most interesting
and we did like a lot of criminal
psychology and it's funny when you do
psychology how many like real life
situations you can apply to it and like
make sense and how people's
personalities make sense when you know a
bit more about their upbringing in child
psychology so it is a really interesting
one and I put and I like subjects that
really test you and get you thinking and
my least favorite was probably maths
even though I did it for a level and I'm
quite good at it like the basic stuff in
there
and then some maybe it just caused me so
much stress and I dropped it as soon as
I could
page underscore Wilson said if you could
only live with three and make up items
for the rest of your life what would
they be
eyebrows mascara of foundation I guess
those three if I could deal with that I
could deal with it Robyn border says you
always rock a nude lip nude lips are
your favorite as in her favorite and she
wants to know what my favorite combo is
at the moment I've absolutely been
loving earth tone pencil from NYX
spotlight liquid lipstick the amur easy
and lip line collection I do have a lip
land discount code down below and a
gloss on top so it'll just be what I'm
feeling on the day so at the moment
those you a skinny dip lip topper is
phenomenal but like I said the coyote or
the Marc Jacobs lip gloss I mentioned
before on top of that as well just
Maisie Bradford said I was watching
yours and Hannah's get ready with me
yesterday and most likely to tag is that
another collab coming we plan to film
that so many videos together we have
like so many ideas and we I mean do all
this stuff together but there's never
really a time to just like sit down and
film but we definitely plan to nothing
way more collabs coming between me and
Han let's meet real koenkan said would
you rather have good hair and bad makeup
24/7 or good makeup and bad hair 24/7 oh
my god definitely good makeup and bad
hair cuz I would this hat on I was
something as long as my face laid it
would be okay crazy over Nile or well
her name's Amy said would you rather
change something from the past or be
allowed to change something happen in
your future I would change if I could
see and what the things was to happen in
my future um I wouldn't change anything
in my past because I'm so happy with
where I am today so if I change anything
and that would like alter it then I
really wouldn't want to do that so I
would definitely change something in the
future if I could see it happen and yeah
I would alter it if I could
Natalie Smith said will you be having
any meet up soon I am going to the meet
up with shot magazine in Manchester I
think it's the 20 is the 27th of August
links on their Twitter and I did retweet
it not too long ago and to get tickets
but if you guys minded me to do a other
type of meetup where it would just be me
a bit more children a bit more relaxed
and let me know I just be scared no one
would turn up I say this every time but
imagine if I was just there and none of
you are because you're all from so many
different places it's hard to find one
place that we can all like me in the
middle favorite cocktail I think it's
got to be a sex on the beach
or do that anything that's got rum in it
like pineapple peach strawberry like
those really are kind of like old
vanilla raspberry like sweet flavors
like they're the kind of cooked as I go
for I'm not like I'm a hito kind of
person unless it's a flavored mijita
like I don't really just like men yeah I
think rum is a nice flavor to have in a
cocktail or like vodka and stuff
flavored vodkas nice what makeup brand
would you love to collab with I think
there's a few I love to collab with a
lashe company because I think lashes are
like a signature thing of mine and I
think I'd be able to really put my like
creating a lush that would be my perfect
lash is always something I've wanted to
do I won't like name specific company is
good I'd love to come up with my own
like a bronze to highlighting palette
cuz you guys know I'm obsessed with
putting like bronze shimmers on my face
and I already had like a vision of one
that was like they had a bronzer in it a
champagne kind of quite a highlighter
and then I could see golden bronze
highlights and that was slightly bigger
that you could put so that had enough
product you could put everywhere I've
already envisioned it in my head it's
like a shiny bronze packaging and yeah
like I've got it in my head just like
putting it to life would be a dream come
true
Josie Peter says where do you get your
backdrop material from in your videos I
want something similar for her she want
something for hers go on Amazon and
search sequin tablecloth that's it and
then literally I got like a rose gold
one and then I just hang it up on my
wall and that's literally it
Amanda Jane says do you have a five-year
plan or are you winging it either
personally or professionally
I'm just winging it like I hope
obviously to continue to do this and
this take me and lead to other
incredible things like is doing at the
moment yeah I think it's just growing my
social media platforms using them for
the better good like either for me
professionally in a sense of coming up
with my own product or collaborating
with a brand or yeah just using it just
making the most of this incredible
opportunity that I've been given I guess
that's why I plan to do it next five
years take it easy
says if you could bring out your own
merchandise what would you do makeup or
something different kind of just
answered this um I think I would
definitely want to do something makeup
related because that's more me I think
so
for me it would definitely be either
lashes or like a nude lip kit or
something bronzy and highlighter es type
thing day yeah so those three things are
like three things I am dying to bring
out or like cuz I think correct me if
I'm wrong they might be the three things
that you associate me with nude lips big
lashes bronze skin if you have any ideas
let me know in the comments down below
what you thought I would bring out or
what you'd like me to bring out and
maybe one day it'll happen ex Han
Hanna's fear says three at favorite
songs right now
I would have to say those three what's
always in your person tonight out so I
take off seat my car an ID and I have
another form of idea it's my rail card
because the picture on my ID and my rail
card I do not look like what I look like
now I've got really dark brown hair so I
always get a question a lot on it so I
have to bring another form of ID that
has the same photo on it but in color so
you can see that it is me and so I have
like something to prove that it's me
because I see my hair is redundant now
so yeah and then I bring the lip option
that I'm wearing on that specific night
I'll bring my studio fix powder and a
small powder brush yeah that's normally
what I bring that studio fix powder
comes with me everywhere and sometimes
depending on if my makeups been playing
up I'll bring lash glue and tweezers
because the amount of girls in the
toilet that's like glue and I'll just
pop up you know I'd say yeah no like
something like that but only a few
little make up it's the end the school
Caitlyn says what's the feeling like to
know you inspire people
/ that you're a role model it's so odd
just because I'm 19 and I look up to so
so so many people and the way that I
look up to people sometimes if I really
think about and I think oh my god two
people look up to me like that it's
really really weird to comprehend but
it's a lot of not like pressure but you
just have to constantly remember that
always that you've got people kind of
looking what you're doing and a lot of
the time like snapchat and stuff there's
a lot of responsibility but it's an
incredible feeling I mean for people to
look up to you how can you not say that
that's an amazing feeling I'm truly
honored to have such an awesome
following of makeup lovers like me on
that now I'm gonna finish the video here
thank you so much for sending in all the
questions I'll make sure studious things
it is nice to just kind of sit down
sometimes and talk to you guys so I
really hope you guys enjoy
this video give it a thumbs up like I
said for more Q&amp;amp;A and more personal chai
tea videos make sure to subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in
the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
