today I am bringing you a few of my
favorite types of products that I love
to use around this time of year for the
party season especially with like
Christmas and New Year's coming up those
of you always ask me kind of work what
my cult or must-have products are when I
go out and stuff so I thought this would
be a brilliant if G video idea I have
teamed up with Beauty Bay to create this
video as they are having a Christmas
sale so the products I have chosen and
now severely discounted and just in time
for Christmas and you can get your hands
on them all are available at obviously
Beauty be calm and I've linked them all
it down below as well as the names of
them and the prices and all the
information that you would need I do
have some of the products on my face
right now so you can get an idea of some
of the things I've chosen but without
further ado let's jump straight into it
so around this time of year I find I'm
constantly at styling my hair curly
straight all the time like with
different events and stuff so I
definitely want to be protecting my hair
making sure it's remaining shiny and
taming any flyaways because I know I
have like naturally that frizzy hair so
one product I've been really loving at
the moment is the matrix of Boyard sugar
shine system illuminating a mist and yes
this illuminating mist is for your hair
what this does is basically it protects
your hair from the heat but at the same
time gives you loads of shine or like or
like holds in your shine tames any
flyaways because it has quite like a um
like an oily finish but like a smoothing
finish so yeah basically smooths your
hair gets shine to your hair and protect
your hair from the heat styling so I use
this kind of before I apply any heat to
my hair and then afterwards as well it's
almost like a finishing spray it is 30%
off now if you're in the kind of look
out for a good heat styling spray that
also is gonna give shine and make your
hair look super healthy again then I
definitely recommend checking it this
out okay next up is definitely more of a
body type product I feel like this is
the time of year especially like I said
with parties and stuff dresses are
getting shorter legs are coming out all
that good stuff so I love this this is
the this works perfect legs sculpt and
shine and it basically is a highlighter
for your legs so what you want to do
with this is kind of apply this to all
the places that you want to highlight
Daniel like down the center of your
casts and your thighs and it has a
really nifty kind of rolling device as I
want to show you and i swatched it so it
I'm just easily glides onto your leg I
love about this is that you don't have
to get like your hands covered in the
product it just kind of rolls onto your
legs and you can easily blend it in with
that as well what I love about this is
kind of more to the fact that it's not a
really intense shimmer it's more like a
natural shine because I feel like you
would want to use other products for
that if you wanted it to be really
really intense so this is super subtle
and it's a really light color so it's
not going to transfer onto your clothes
which is a massive thing you don't want
to kind of throughout the night wearing
your white dress and then suddenly you
realize it's gone from an ombre of brown
to white rather than it's staying white
all night so I think this product is
about twenty percent off it is now 19
pounds and yeah basically perfect for
those of you that love to add a bit of
shimmer to your legs but nothing too
intense you guys know me and I love a
gold smokey eye and I feel like around
this time of year everyone lots of gold
smokey eye and some of the most gorgeous
pigmented eyeshadows are from at Natasha
- no no this is one of her mono metallic
eyeshadows in the shade at gold flesh
and natasha de Nonna products I actually
have another one here are a little bit
expensive so definitely make the most of
this sale I think has single shadows are
normally over like just over 20 pounds
and this is now like 13 I actually have
it on my eyes right now for you guys so
you can kind of see so yeah like I said
if you don't want to like invest in one
of her massive pallets per se definitely
try out some of her single shadows
especially the metallic ones as you
would have seen by the swatch and stuff
they are so pigmented and I love a good
gold eyeshadow so this one is in the
shade gold flesh I think everyone needs
a good bold eye shadow speaking of like
eyes and makeup and stuff you obviously
are going to need a good eye shadow
palette beautybay kind of it teamed up
with her cosmetics to bring an exclusive
cheek and eyes set like this and they're
super miniature so perfect for kind of
traveling around if you're getting ready
at your friend's house you don't want to
bring like a crap turn I shadow is like
I said it is a cheek and eye palette and
I do have a couple of the shades from
this on my in my crease at the moment as
you can see it offers a range of crease
and lid shades on a kind of actually
cooler and then there's a couple of
warmer tones in there as well but I feel
like this is kind of perfect
just combined with the shimmery shade
and create a effortless smoky eye and
like I said smokey eyes for the party
season is a must-have for me but then I
also feel like you could create
something really easy and everyday with
this as well so maybe this could be a
party it must have for the night time
and the morning after I will have
includes it's watching them so you can
see how pigmented these are as well and
like I said I have it kind of the war
and the slightly darker brown ones in my
crease at the moment like I said it does
come as a like a duo pact so it also
comes with a cheat palette which I'm
wearing as well so this contains a range
of blush shades a giant highlighter and
bronzer kind of gives you a a blush
shape for all I think these ones are
slightly more on the matte side and
these ones have a bit more of a shimmer
to it so it's something for everyone I'm
in love with this bronzer shade because
it's slightly more on the kind of golden
warmer side so again this kind of saves
you when you're getting ready at your
friend's house having to pack loads of
different blushes and bronzers and they
come in a little and nifty a set like
this and the price is obviously at them
included together which I will have it
linked down below so this is an
exclusive with pur cosmetics for Beach
Bay so definitely check it out while you
can
to get in the market for like a good
cheek blush palette and an eyeshadow
palette definitely it killed two birds
with one stone and while the sale is
still on another must have it for the
party season for me personally it's a
matte liquid lipstick I think a matte
lips just can withstand the test of time
if you're drinking eating you're out
just talking to everyone I feel like
they just last the longest time and
definitely a must-have this time of year
a brand I've been loving at the moment
is actually coloured raine and this is
what I am wearing right now I think it's
such a gorgeous blush a pink color not
normally something I would wear but I
think it makes a a subtle statement and
this one is in the shade at 24/7 and
I've linked it down below of course yeah
I think now with the sale on this is
only about like 9 pounds 60 under a
tenner so amazing if you've wanted to
try this pranks I know is massive in
America and that's the best thing about
Beauty Bay is that they stop so many
American brands that we always want to
try obviously for us at UK people or at
the UK prices I know they have a ton of
colors to try so if you don't
necessarily like this one then have a
browse and there will definitely be one
for everyone and finally I know I
mentioned a leg blow kind of type
product but you guys know I love to just
glow all over face decolletage
everything and I thought I would make
the most of it considering it's
quite expensive I picked up the etosha
Danone a face and body glow in the shade
light at the moment I love applying a
cream a highlighter
before a powder one I feel like it
really intensifies it and this one is
for your face and body so I picked it up
in light so I could apply it to my face
as well as the highest points are kind
of like my collarbones and that good
stuff this is actually usually at 46
pounds but it is 40% off in the sale so
definitely it check this out if you're
in the market for a good or body glow
and you can also use it on your face - I
do have it on my cheeks right now and
yeah I would probably apply this I would
fake tan the day before
wake up shower off the fake tan and then
apply this when I'm kind of in the midst
of getting ready and stuff so I've still
got that kind of tan underneath and then
apply this to the highest points I feel
like on news and Christmas you are
totally allowed to be extra like the
tinsel and the lights on your tree and
glow just as bright and this is a
perfect product to do so you can
obviously apply that or Daniel eggs too
but yeah I prefer kind of those kind of
liquid illuminators are a bit more
intense on my face and like chest area
those are kind of my top six of types of
products for the party season I feel
like for me personally I wouldn't be
able to make it through without those
kind of products all of which I have
linked down below and are available at
YouTube AECOM as part of their up to 50%
off sale for the Christmas season so
definitely make sure to check them out
on at Beach PACOM and obviously all the
other products that they have in there

of year or what your favorite must have
