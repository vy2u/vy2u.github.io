today I thought I would do a different
kind of video for you something that
involves me kind of sitting down and
talking to you rather than like a makeup
tutorial but I do have a morning routine
coming soon which is makeup and hair so
stay tuned but that one I'm gonna be
announcing the winner to my giveaway in
this video so I'll leave a little thing
that says kind of like skip to breathe a
little bit because I'm gonna be talking
a lot about the lovely beauty box first
but all you're interested in to see is
who want the giveaway then skip forward
to whether I've put yeah today I thought
I would talk about kind of new Beauty
finds and one thing in particular I
wanted to talk about was a subscription
box service now I've never done one of
these before I've only really ever heard
of them while watching like American
youtubers like I know kathleenlights
always does her like if see unboxing or
her like a boxycharm unboxing and I
always find them really interesting
because they seem like such a great
concept in the sense that like you're
getting a few products that are normally
really expensive but you're paying
they're like set amount so I think it's
like a really good idea and so the
people are love me beauty which I hadn't
actually heard of and then I was looking
at people like in the throne they kind
of talked about them before as well and
reached out to me and just said whether
or not I wanted to try it out and see if
I liked it and just show you guys
because I know in the UK beauty boxes
aren't really that kind of big and I
think if there's like a real big gap in
the market for it especially
the love new beauty brand because what
they try and do is incorporate products
that you can't easily access in the UK
so say there's brands like two-faced or
something like that that like you've
always wanted to try but it can be quite
hard to get hold of that's what they
trying to be try and incorporate bigger
brand slender they're going through this
big kind of revamp at the moment where
they're kind of getting loads of brands
and to join up with them which i think
was pretty cool so this is what it came
in it's just a black box and I haven't
actually looked inside yet I've kind of
opened this to see what the books like I
haven't actually looked at the products
inside ok so this is the box so it's
weak you actually I'm so it says lovely
beauty in rows of gold which hi and it's
sort of box side so it comes in like a
little sack like that and a card that
says I have too much makeups said that
no woman ever I just has all that
information on the back but what's good
about this one is I don't know if this
is the same with every beauty box cuz
I've seen when you try don't really know
what you pay or see the set amount a
month
okay so they're three steps
they're four steps even is one to begin
your profile so you basically kind of
pick certain style icons that you like
and like makeup looks that you like from
some celebrities and stuff like that and
then they'll recommend products tailored
to the individual looks for you or so
you can have a range of yourself what I
think is they offer you for kind of
coupons that allow you to pick four
products kind of not necessarily for
free but yet they kind of offer you the
coupons to get those products and then
you can pay a little bit extra for a
little bit so you really want to try it
so I think that's the kind of thing how
it works okay so they'll give you six
credits per subscription month and you
can add as many other products as you
like so then yes so you get six
complementary products and then you add
as many other ones as you're born but I
think cuz mine's a sample one that they
should not even leave for any I think
yeah so this it's a little fact that it
comes in
okay so the two brands I got things from
were two-faced and Malenko and Ikey it
obviously both those brands before and
they are amazing as so or two smoothness
so this is oh it's like a cheek and lip
tint from Morocco in the shade just
peachy
so this kind of shade is like my
favorite for like yeah spring and summer
this but just a swatch and in the pot
but it kind of blends up to be like a
really subtle peach color I love that so
next from model coat is party proof lip
cream in the shade after hours so it
looks like this model coat is an
Australian brand if you didn't know they
do have a UK website I think but it's a
lot bigger in the in like Australia
stuff like that so that's really key to
their like incorporating it oh that's a
hardy case for the lipstick that looks
like this let's go up you see like a
little mare on the side so everything
you're like applying it ha oh my god
that's stunning
I love red especially for like the
summer party season like I probably got
like white for like my outfit choice I
don't know not really this just ends
happened and then I really like to just
up with like a bright color since this
kind of color is polarized up my street
a few more things so I've got on both of
these those two things I think were full
sized samples and then these two from
Too Faced are kind of miniatures so I've
got the Too Faced better than sex
mascara which I have the full size of
but I am really running out of it since
this has come at the perfect time oh
that's so sweet and this is perfect for
like going out just like putting your
clutch bag or something like that yeah
yeah I literally love this mascara so
much it's what my favorite and then
finally as a little sample of the
chocolate Soleil bronzer I've always
wanted to try this
I've smelled it before when I was in
Sephora in New York and it smells
amazing just like all them all there are
the stuff and this is in
shade medium I think oh my god so it
looks like that so this is kind of the
perfect contour shade
but I'm gonna get a lot of use of that
and again that's very good for just like
travel-size of you as well to like put
in your clutch bag or something like
that it was everything that was in that
subscription box normally there would be
six products I think in this month I
think mr. safe they sent it to me just
to test out um yeah no definitely worth
checking it out I'll leave the link to
that website down below and also if you
use the promo code Rachel 20 you will
get 20% off your first subscription if
that makes sense but just really sweet
of them I had the privilege of actually
going it to there and might be their
headquarters in London and meeting more
and the team are so sweet they're trying
so hard to just really promote their
brand and so I was really happy to do
this for them there's not a sponsored
video or opinions on my own and I didn't
have to do this really didn't ask me to
I really wanted to show you you guys
just because I think it's such a good
concept and I've always wanted to try
beautiful since I've never known which
one to try so I'm really glad that I had
the opportunity to try this one just
because I've really loved it when things
really sleek the products are actually
ones that you'll want to use because
there's nothing worse than doing like
paying a certain amount a month for a
subscription and then getting like a
green nail varnish
like purple eyeliner and I know that's
up like someone else's Street but you
know and it's just products that's like
that's not for everyone like not
everyone's going to want to use that but
I'm really glad that they incorporated
some bright colors but I feel like
they're kind of wearable bright colors
and overseer eye mascara and bronzer you
can't really go wrong and I know they'll
change that products every month but
this kind of just gives you idea if the
kind of stuff that you would get and I
feel like this is just right up
everyone's the streets I hope you guys
enjoyed this kind of new finds beauty
video I might kind of do these on a
monthly basis just like new things that
I've tried or discovered I might kind of
do more hauls and stuff I'm still kind
of trying to find what like what kind of
channel I want my channel to be if that
makes sense like I know all the time
it's like makeup tutorials and stuff
like that but I'm going to be doing a
morning routine video next that
obviously isn't a makeup tutorial it's
kind of more lifestyle and I think
that's the kind of route I might want to
go down but let me know if you guys just
want me to stick to makeup tutorials and
that kind of just be X or C that is it's
a huge
audience of people that want to watch
that - a bigger audience of people that
might want to see more kind of
down-to-earth videos where you kind of
get to like chitchat and stuff a lot
more it's time to announce the winner -
might give away so by doing this I'm
just going on this website called like I
don't know that but yeah basically it
just you put in the Europe or l2 the
