today is a super exciting video it's a
New Year's Eve alert lab with the
gorgeous Khloe Morton here on YouTube we
both wanted to create different kinds of
New Year's Eve looks for you guys and
this one is Khloe's she's created this
gorgeous pink / bleak glittery eye with
a matching lips if you want to see that
tutorial I'll leave the link to it down
below as well of all of her social media
so make sure to go follow and subscribe
if you haven't already but if you want
to see my tutorial then please keep
watching
starting with eyebrows done I'll leave
all products down below I am moving on
to the skin and priming with my Smashbox
illuminating primer but first just
hydrating my skin with my mac fix+
sprayed this is kind of my step when i
can't be bothered to a prime oyster Iser
and this prime is good in the sense that
it gives a really nice glow to the skin
but also adds a bit of a bronze tint so
as you can see I am quite fake tan in
this video but my face looks a bit paler
so that just helps to balance it out so
moving on to the eye makeup I've already
primed my eyes and I'm just going in
with Mac's soft brown on a larger fluffy
brush and just buffing that into the
crease as my initial transition shade I
kind of wanted to keep my crease cooler
movia tone so I'm going in with makeup
eats country girl on a smaller fluffier
brush I'm using this to further deepen
up the subject
then I'm using 15 from make up eat to
further deepen up my Sofia this is one
of my favorite makeup heat I chose it's
such a gorgeous plum shade and it
reminds me of the color scheme that
Chloe's using in her video to all ties
in together and I'm just like I said
bustling seaport in to my socket and I'm
kind of building up the color as I go
just so I can really get that purple
tone in there
now it's time for the glitter I recently
got this Inglot number 66 - and I'm
absolutely in love with it it is so
glittery so a bright so I am just
packing that on using the Too Faced
glitter glue to make sure I get minimal
fallout and the color intensity and like
pigment of the glitter is intense as it
can be oh my god it's like my favorite
glitter and then going back in with that
brush that I use to apply bitten with
barely any excess product on it just to
make sure the transition is nice and
smooth between shadow and glitter
then using badda-bing from makeup geek
as a further crease shade just to you
know create that smoky effect from light
to dark and intensify the outer corner
of my crease then using the wipe to
create a wing I kind of am going for a
slightly lower wing than I normally do
just so when I do my liner and the
lashes and everything is all super glam
super intense and I'm highlighting my
inner corner using white lives from
makeup geek which is essentially just
and matte white eyeshadow and mixing the
anastasia beverly hills highlight in
that star light as well just so I get a
bit of shimmer in there too then I'm
gonna go ahead and do a my winged
eyeliner using the Inglot number 77 I do
have a tutorial on this so I will leave
that down below and then it using
corrupt from makeup geek which is just a
matte black eyeshadow and going in with
a small flat shader brush just to create
an even deeper socket and a Brede smoky
effect
future
just applying a light coat of mascara
because as it smears and because it's me
I'm gonna be applying lashes I'm using
the severe lash again from velu but use
whatever lashes you love or that are
your favorite as New Year's it's the
time to be super Graham now onto skin I
am going full full coverage I'm mixing
Giorgio Armani with coverfx cream
foundation and using my Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer in the shade light
warm just to highlight all the places
that I usually would I'm also taking
this time just to be really precise
underneath my eyeliner to make sure that
it's super crisp and super sharp to set
everything in place I am using my Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder just
to make sure my skin is for matte and
it's gonna last the longest time because
if you're going out or anything guys
obviously what you won't become your
makeup I'm then also going over the top
of that with this need cosmetics
translucent powder in the shade nude
just to give a bit of an iridescent feel
or appearance to the skin
iridescent powders like the hourglass
one as well just under the eye make it
look super glam and flawless I love it
I'm then using the Kat Von D palette to
contour and bronze around my face and my
cheekbones using this Zoe but fluffy
brush and taking it down onto my neck as
well then using my Inglot body shimmer
which is my new favorite thing and just
applying that essentially just where the
places that I applied the contour but
just to add a bit of glow to the skin
the blusher I am using a makeup eats
honeymoon which is a soft sparkly pink
shade just to tie in with the sparkle
and the glow to the skin and the eyes
I'm then highlighting my cheekbones and
keep his bow and down the bridge of my
nose with Matt oh darling Anastasia
Beverly Hills are so Hollywood and the
Kiko I should have been tr-8r dupes for
this if you didn't manage to get hold of
this cuz this was a limited edition
they're not moving back on it - it's
that I make up I am it using the a look
list that we use on the lid and just
placing that on the inner third of my
eye spraying it with fix+ before just to
add a bit of adhesive and then going
back in with the country girl eyes
shadow on a pencil brush and buffing
that connecting it to the glitter so
it's softened out and then using the
small shader brush that we used earlier
with a bit of black eyeshadow placing it
on the outer third of my eye and then
going back in with the pencil brush
again to smooth and buff it out I'm then
applying bottom lash mascara and then
that is the eyes finished moving on to
the lips I asked you guys on Twitter
what you wanted to see and I decided to
do a brown lip as something a bit
different up so you can pair with ever
you want this is the Kylie lip kit in a
true at Brown at Kay I'm absolutely in
love with it it really ties in with the
eye makeup but like I said you can do
whatever you want and that is the
finished look I really hope you guys
