today I'm doing a going out having kind
of appropriate makes look so to start
with I'm priming my eye using my Mac
soft ochre paint or on my kind of brow
bone area and then a more darker base
and this is maybelline color cast
impairment so the developers are going
to be using on the middle gonna be so
difficult or ostriches better then using
a warm Brown this is creme brulee from
low tech dudes I'm using efficiently for
tea but then it up into the crease just
above the dark face when we look like
the lid then you can just write how to
tell if you Milton Ragnhild favorites
palette I'm using those away the brush
just to place this below the warm brown
shades that we applied into the crease
and then blending out a deck of the
Sigma e-40 brush
and then using victim form a complete
story though that was our focus and
again doing the same kind of technique
bit plating is just below the powerful
then it seems to darker P brown shades
together and moving this to to further
define the crease and a pencil brush
make a short should not get this on the
lid at the time you're going to cut the
crease but it'll be really softly next
unmixing max blue brown prism and the
makeup revolution liquid eye primer and
I mix these little fish kind of just
with a move that is using 6 plus of
medium how to ease out so it just makes
a pigment stay on and up here a lot more
metallic and you put this all over the
lid and using up the makeup seat
maybe he's meal definer brush again
doing the same technique as we visit
sittin although there might be enough
you don't sound hollow largest using a
good cut the food and and blending out
into the book
and I felt like I needed to warm up my
crease rightly so I'm going to do some
makeup to move really lightly like a
pretty much tapped off and most of the
product and using it on a second in 40
just at the very edge of my eyeshadow
just soften it out and then using the
morphe gel liner in Slate just to do my
liner and then I felt like it wasn't
really like dark enough over the top of
the pigment so I go in with my NYC
liquid liner just to darken and define
it a bit further now onto the skin I'm
using my Mac Studio moisture cream and
my urban decay makeup setting spray with
oil control just apply my skin and then
using my NARS all day luminous
foundation in Stromboli and my la girl
pro conceal in creamy beige and not
anything you can seal it in gently to
highlight entrance around my eyes
especially if I'm going out I have to
make sure that I fit under my eyes and
the rest of my face with a matte palette
I'm using my Mac Studio 6 in NC 20 to
highlight under my eyes and then using
my Mac Studio care blend powder in
medium to set my whole thing and it's
also why I used in the oil control spray
to set my skin and I used a all days
throwing foundation quanto I'm using
that boxing powder in oh and the
anastasia beverly hills torrance shade
is really similar and then to bronze up
my skin I'm using the Bobbi Brown
highlighter in bronze glow and then
using a makeup suite after go click
click
pigment to highlight my cheekbones
then taking makeup geek bitten on a
pencil brush and just blending this
underneath my eye and then I'm using
makeup geek mock I think it was I'm a
small definer brush just to smoke it out
and add a bit more definition to my
lower lash line I then went ahead and
applied mascara and you can leave as
that but I feel like the eyes are too
intense so I have to put them lashes on
and these the I'll or one four nine now
on to lips I'm using Mac world lipliner
and Kat Von D Agatha lipstick and to
prime I'm using my Mac prep and prime
lip which makes such a difference when
applying your lip liner that goes on so
much more smoothly and it loves so much
longer and I highly recommend it I know
it's not something that you immediately
think about when you apply your lips and
people just apply lip balm but trust me
that primer smells and as in smells it's
so good and works really well on the
lips and I'm just using mac studio
finish concealer in the center of my
lips as well and if you're wondering
about the Mac well liner anything I'm
not gonna be able to hold a bit I stood
by to and I bought it and it will be in
my 10,000 subscriber giveaway so make
sure to check out that so that's in the
city school boy I hope you liked it let
me know in the comments below things
that you want to see in the future
please give this a thumbs up it really
helps me out and I'll see you next time
