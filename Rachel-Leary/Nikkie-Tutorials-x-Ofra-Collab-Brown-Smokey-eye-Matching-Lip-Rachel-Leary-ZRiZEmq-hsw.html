so today I'm assuming a matte brown
smokey eye half a country's neck and
what really inspired me to kind of use
more brown tones and stuff I recently
received the Oprah and Nicki tutorials
collaboration which contains a gorgeous
highlighter thank you so much I'm at
three liquid lipstick shades one is a
nude one is an orange and one is a
metallic Brown which as you can see is
what I was inspired by and used today it
is not out yet I think it's out in a
week so I just kind of went to create a
look using it get you guys excited so
you can see what it looks like when I
put it on obviously I haven't put the
shades on just a couple of them but I'm
sure I would do looks using them very
soon make sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoy it and subscribe
if you haven't already if you need to my
channel then welcome because if you like
the look of this makeup look and want to
see how I do it then please keep
watching okay I'm trying to just keep
using it natural light but if it starts
to dip that I'm active change it so
apologies for that
first things first I'm going to address
two things one yes my some gel color has
come off no that's not blood the rest
are dark too yeah the town of my hand is
a bit Dodger than lemon
and if any of those few things are going
to send you throughout this video and
drive you and feel like you need to
leave a comment leave now because I'm
already addressing it I am aware thank
you both things like to prep the skin
I'm going to use my Vanessa fabulous and
drench moisturizer honestly if you have
dry skin
I really recommend purchasing this I
don't know if there's maybe like a
sample size or I know it stops on like
looks fantastic and all that stuff but I
feel like it would be in store in
something like Marks and Spencers if
you're from the UK ask for Istanbul if
you see it just you don't want from the
money just you actually feel like it's
just under 30 quid but if you are in the
market for a moisturizer I think you can
test this out because
I swear so god this has like really
drastically improve my skin it just
always gives me a really nice glow at
I'm herb first so primer I'm going to
use the NARS radiant primer this is the
light pink one again perfect if you have
normal to dry skin it gives a gorgeous
glow and I just literally got that all
over my face and just buff it in with my
multitask face brush from a puffy sleek
from Real Techniques sleek technique I'm
just obsessive the way that makes my
skin look okay for foundation I'm going
to use my Giorgio Armani a luminous silk
in the shade at 7.5 yep I'm actually
quite tired at the moment so this much
really - that I do obviously like to
wear a lighter concealer underneath
which actually lightens up your whole
phase once you do that so the foundation
doesn't appear as dark as you think I'm
just going to do like stripes like that
I'm going to use my Beauty Blender to
just blend that into the skin I feel
like I should not use this foundation in
forever I've been like loving drugstore
foundations at the moment and I've been
kind of mixing foundations and all that
stuff and I forget this is obviously my
fave of all time dad make sure to blend
it down your neck yes I'm aware it
probably look funny right now
pretty sure I've pounded that into my
skin just not what I actually have stop
okay moving on to concealer I'm going to
take a or fade the Maybelline age rewind
in the shade light to help brighten up
underneath my eyes please coming up some
left alone and also I like to take up
the sides of my nose because that helps
it make it appear slightly narrower
that and then I'm going to use my
slightly smaller beauty blender to blend
that out this concealer actually has
such an amazing coverage to it one of
the like most hydrating full coverage
consumers I've actually used because a
lot of full coverage concealers can feel
quite dry whereas I feel this one's got
like a really good coverage and it's
so-so like creamy on the skin and I feel
that it's quite hydrating as well but
then also again I have prepped my skin
for it to feel quite hydrated so it
might just be that but I do feel like
the formula this is absolutely a
beautiful
so once I've gone and done that I think
that's all the creams I wanted to use on
my face Garrett so I am going to go
ahead and set that in case I'm going to
my old favorites that are CMA no color
powder
there's nothing against Laura we've not
fallen out or anything like that just
thought like I'm mixing up a little bit
I've been really loving a new technique
where I bake with this but then I use a
pressed powder and I'll show you that
when it comes to it and make cover my
brush in it and then use that once way
and it like read buttons up underneath
your eyes so I'll show you that in a
minute but yeah I'm just going to go
ahead and bake and move my eyes I'm just
going to set my lids as well and above
my brows come to do my brows now as well
and then I just like to - sit around and
just set a good kid but then just search
everywhere else just by dusting all in
place and I'm just going to leave that
there and then I'm going to go ahead and
fill in my eyebrows and to do that I'm
using the precise brow pencil in the
shade number four from benefit and then
I will most likely sculpt out using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills concealer in a
1.5 but sometimes I like to save that
till the end because I you did help
blend up my eyeshadow so I'm going to go
ahead and do my brows and then one eye
and then I will come back and do the
other eye and show you how I did okay so
this is kind of what I came up with I
haven't done eyeliner in a while and I
wasn't planning on doing it and I saw it
and I was like you know what I'm gonna
do it so yeah I've done her hand and
done my eyebrows and I did it's got the
mount like I said using the Anastasia
but be enough concealer in at 1.5 then
it for the eyes I'm going to take the
Amalfi at 30 upside Oh Empire is
literally all matte
on shades which I love I'm going to take
these two these two shape here as our
initial transition colors and it just
buff boys into the three and so that I'm
going to use the ax Sigma e30 eight
diffuse crease brush I was thinking of
giving a favorite brushes types videos
so let me know if you'd be interested in
that I'm just going to bust this into
the crease now because I decided to do a
kind of hard cut crease I want to go
from inner to outer corner and the kind
of pigmentation be the same I want to be
really heavy because I'm going to cut it
out and then look at some more eyeshadow
and like the darker colors you apply
they're kind of more of a cut crease
it'll be I want each color to shows
we're not actually using that many
eyeshadows today only a few from that
palette that you're just going from
inner to outer corner and like women
scream or what motions it's like and
I'll shake it all about Dana
then from the same palette I'm going to
take this brown shade right here I'm
just using a slightly smaller fluffy
brush again picking up quite a lot but
more pios already pigmented so it'd be
it careful that you don't apply too much
fun kind of dabbing those on the brush
and tapping it off it sounds like such a
waste I know but it's just the way my
hands want to work we're just going to
bust that and the crease just underneath
where we place that other color and
again taking this all the way across
from like inner to outer corner we want
to be really smoky rich seduction you
know she's going back quickly for back
for shake it and then I'm going to pick
up the crease brush again and pick up
the initial kind of two colors that we
use in the crease just to bring like
birth it back in to reinforce that color
and make sure everything is all blended
out and then that's kind of it for the
crease colors we are going to go with
one more but I'm going to do a little
step before that
so now we are going to kind of cut the
crease and tonight I'm just going to use
the Anastasia revealed concealer again
and just take a little synthetic brush
that spreads like mint for cream picking
up a little amount because I feel like
you don't to provide too much
a little crease and transfer so I always
find it easier to look down into a
mirror I always say this looking down so
it doesn't transfer up anyways and then
just going to kind of start on a place
that you're competent I like your open
lid because you're not like carving out
an open lid and then once I'm in a
corner and start to drag it up just kind
of as you've cut the crease when you
gets like these bits I kind of just like
dab the concealer so it starts to
diffuse I mean we will make it easier
and diffuse it with eyeshadows about
that if I kind of taking it about 3/4 of
the way across and it's going to kind of
Pat that Pat that down I'm really trying
not to look up right now and click on
transferred on time so move quickly
quick quick quick I'm going to take this
matte white shade here from the palette
and then I'm going to use that to set it
all in place try that shadow I'm just
going to kind of press it on I don't
want to move anything about I'm then
just going to run my fluffy brush over
the top because it will just wipe away
any of the lid kind of color that's not
attached to the cream because it's all
been set in place then I'm going to go
back in with that brown shade that we
use in the crease on the same brush and
just kind of buff it back inwards and
then I run on top of the cream kind of
like dab it on and then just kind of
diffuse it in I like these like
backwards and forwards like zigzag
emotions like that this is really giving
me like white and dark chocolate eyes I
think and then finally from the same
palette I'm going to take me a darkest
matte brown shade and just on a even
smaller to fine fluffy brush I think
this one is from Azul either I'm just
going to place this in the outermost
part of the eye
like that and then a really quickly
highlight my inner corner before
applying eyeliner and for that I'm going
to use the meaty tutorials and over
highlighter and I'm going to take the
two lighter shades and just kind of mix
them together on a pencil brush in here
oh yes
blind me pinky can you tell I've been
watching way way too many Michael hench
and Charlie gremlin videos then like
together they are actually hilarious
like I can't when you watch like one of
their videos you just catch on to
everything that they say I keep going in
an Australian accent as well as
downstairs my mother she's like showing
me something else oh absolutely stunning
and thank you all right so now I'm going
to go ahead and do the gel liner after
that I'm using the Illamasqua precision
gel liner in infinity which is just a
black shade and I'm using a Mac to
attend brush to do that and as you can
see on the other eye if you show you I
literally just did it straight across
ends it there and then we are going to
use that dark brown shade again just to
kind of buff it in I feel like it's such
an effective way if you like going
eyeliner that they've been a winged try
out having try out having like a
blown-out wing shadow like we have here
and then just a line over the top I feel
like it's just as pretty you've got like
a big lid space as well sorry we are
going to have to be silent while we do
this because I'm not actually breathing
alright folks we've done it the hard
part is those but yeah now I'm like I
said I'm just going to go back in with
that really really dark brown shade the
darkest line that we did use and just
stab that just over where it finishes
and maybe like butter on the top just so
it kind of blends into nothing is that
make sense yeah yeah right so underneath
the lash line we're just basically going
to repeat it with the colors I'm going
to go in with the darkest of the two
first one so just slightly more of a
mustard color and just buff that in and
connect it up then I'm going to use a
flat like a flat top brush like this and
then pick the darkest Brown that
literally just use like
puffing the eyeliner and really press
that into the lash line and then go back
in with a pencil and just diffuse out I
wanted this to be really kind of dark
and smoky and then finally I'm going to
take this aqua XL eyeliner from Make Up
For Ever in the shade m60 a really
gorgeous dark warm brown and I'm going
to put that in my lash line and then my
like water line wait the other way
around do you know me then I'm just
going to go ahead and apply mascara
after that I'm using the falsies angel
push-up mascara from Maybelline and for
lashes today I am going to be using the
Lily lashes ooh
in the style diamonds they're like a
gorgeous round fluttery eyelash and I
get mine from wheeler is it false lashes
dr. D UK so I will leave the link to
them down below while the lashes are
drying I can wipe away my under eyes now
we've finished what I want to do is take
this this is the Mac Pro emphasize
weight Mac Pro powder in the shade
emphasize and take it on a big brush
like this this is the Sigma o the Sigma
tapered face brush and then wipe away
the under eye but then it leaves you
with a curb really gorgeous glow and
just kind of helps keep it really bright
underneath there I think just that all
over my face now we can apply the false
eyelashes okay so the glue is just dry
on that one but I obsessed with these
eyes I love a good matte smoky eye and
I've not done a brown and white one and
ages so now let's move on to the skin
and then the I will dry later so for the
skin I'm going to take via sleek makeup
face form in the shade medium and just
take the bronze I'm also going to use be
like shimmery bronzer as well that size
I'm just going to use the kind of more
contour color such a gorgeous contour
color inserting more tan skin tones and
then just going to take that same color
and just use it to contour my nose
slightly kind of just blend that in with
my Beauty Blender doesn't it out you
know Oh son don't do this to me
okay now I'm just going to take a
slightly bigger fluffier brush and this
one is the amok one three five like this
and like I said you can take that
shimmery bronzer your color just really
lightly and just use that to kind of
warm up the complexion because the other
one was slightly more of a cooler toned
and I want like rich ah
okay I'm sorting the flying out text
okay we're back now setting more other
even light so you're just using that to
warm everything up I'm kind of sticking
with a warming tanned vibe such a blush
I'm gonna take it be Milania bellissimo
the Milani balasana the men not the
Milani bellissimo bronze blusher okay
and now finally we can apply our
highlight and for that we're going to
take the nikkietutorials and opal
cosmetics highlight our well I'm so
excited to use it not tried it as like a
full-blown highlighter yet and I'm going
to use the Anastasia Beverly Hills
highlighter brush to apply it like all
shades so I'm going to mix it across the
mall oh my god
that is beautiful take it a bit up here
as well ah love that I knew I was going
like any I didn't we know why I'm acting
surprised
oh yes doll that's another one doll well
it's like me and my friends buy such
hands like your right hand

cupids Perla no it's like my nose could
live like to my nose you know when
someone just applies to your tat like a
message and I sent that message like
last night how probably reply my second
anyway and then let's take it on the
Cupid's phone but yes that is the skin
it complete and now the collection does
come with an orange and nude and a brown
and instead of going for my classic nude
I thought I'll go to the brown shade to
match the eyes and it's got a metallic
finish and it is called Kovan
I think I want to go and grab a brown
lip liner be right back
I didn't think I want to do at first
because it was a it's a metallic liquid
lipstick but I think I want to now whoa
