today I decided to do a kind of another
full look but this time it is kind of
cocky and olive inspired that kind of
full color scheme there's lots of
glitter it's round and it's super easy
and I think you could pair it with kind
of any sort of lip maybe even sock but
you know me I love a good at nude but I
did go for kind of like a warm peachy
nude to kind of complement the green so
I hope you guys liked this look if you
did make sure to give it a thumbs up I
know you'll get questions on this but
the t-shirt I'm wearing is from Bershka
the necklace I'm wearing is Windsor
store and this all this gold one here is
actually my kind of Libra star sign but
it's in like a constellation so like it
that's what it looks like as a star
thing if that makes sense I think that's
what the purpose of this one is anyway
it's from the wanderlust and they do
kind of every star sign and it's super
cute I'm really into that kind of thing
yeah they have like a little pop-up
store in touch for at the moment that
will go by November the 12th so
definitely check them out yeah so if you
like the look of this olive glittery
rounded smokey eye type thing kiski
watching okay so I know I want this to
kind of be like a rounded eye and
normally that would mean I would do all
my skin first but because I'm going to
be using glitters and stuff I think I
want to go ahead and do my eyes first so
I'm going to go ahead and prime my eyes
so the trick doing that I'm going to
take the Tarte shape tape concealer in
the shade tan because this is going to
kind of match the kind of my skin and
they take this all around my eye I'd
quite loathe them and I do go ahead and
do my foundation or anything like that
just in case I can always one away or I
can just not go all the way up to my
iron ruin the kind of round affair I'm
just gonna brush that on and go
underneath as well then just blend that
all around
then you're going to want to go ahead
and set that in place with like a flesh
tone eyeshadow or a powder just so none
of the eyeshadows kind of came to the
wetness of the primer or concealer that
you've used and I'm also just going to
go ahead and do my eyebrows and for that
I'm using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
brow Wiz in soft brown and the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow pen in life so I like
to do is fill the main kind of body of
the brow in with the pencil and then
this pen is really good just to kind of
like feather through and just get any of
the kind of other bits but I didn't get
and just sharpen and clean everything up
okay so mainly on the eyes we are going
to take the Natasha de Nonna's star
power I've not used this in a tutorial
yet alloyed was perfect especially hold
on this side it's got such gorgeous warm
and olivey tones so we're going to start
off using this shade here as our initial
transition color we're just going to
buff that into our crease and build up
as much color intensity as you want this
is just like I said a transition color
so you don't want it to be too intense
it's just going to help blend all the
other colors together
then we're going to take this brown
color here as color just further deepen
up the crease this brown definitely has
kind of like it's almost cuckoo Minnie
brown so it's perfect for the kind of a
transition color for this look
now I'm going to use a few products on
the lid feel free to use as little or
you don't have to take these steps but
I'm going to take this color from the
detector now in a palette on my finger
and just run that over as a base but
then we are going to go in with a
pigment on top I find her eye shadows
apply better with a finger and then just
on the inner corner bits I'm gonna use a
brush to get really precise you can see
why we did our eyes first and not skin
because there's a little bit for up
that's fine like I said now I'm going to
take this pigment this is from Alexa
para Seco cosmetics and it is one of her
HD pigments in the color regal I'm
obsessed she is this gorgeous gorgeous
girl on Instagram and she's come up with
all her own products and she kindly
gifted them to me so I'm super excited
to try I've used a few of her pigments
previously not in a tutorial own thing
but I'm really impressed and so I'm just
going to take a little bit of this one
on a flat brush and just press that on
top of the eyeshadow I just did this to
kind of intensify the base color before
we go in with glitter for glitter I'm
going to mix the two together this is
the supernova like sparkling I think
from makeup geek and this is from a
makeup forever it is the bronze one in
it's called number five ruler bottle or
something like that I'll leave it listed
down below and I'm just going to put
these or like dispense these into a
little petri dish and mix them together
and then go in with them on top as a
base on my eye I'm going to take a
little bit of the Mac's mixing medium
that eyeliner version just put it on the
back of my hand then just taking a
concealer brush I'm just going to place
that on my lid where I want the glist to
go
I'm just going to kind of tap it on
because I don't want to move any of the
lid color just a really thin coat and
then go into my little glitter mixture
that I made and then
just press it on the top
just kind of pressing it on I'm obsessed
then I'm just going to go back in with
my little fluffy brush and just kind of
brush around the edges then dipping back
into the Natasha denying a palette I'm
going to mix this brown and this brand
together just in the out pop the crease
to blend everything together and you
always want to go back in with your
initial fluffy brush and make sure
everything is blended together then for
inner corner highlight I've been loving
the no money no honey pigment from the
balm because it's a broody gorgeous kind
of like champagne color so I think it
really complements like green and warm
tones I'm just going to take down a
little pencil brush
Oh God first of all nitric it'll use a
powder brush and just lightly brush away
the fallout underneath our eyes and then
yeah going in with this champagne color
then I'm going to go ahead and pry it
mascara and then for lashes I'm going to
take the goddess lashes from my pal
cosmetics as they are so gorgeous
they're like a perfect rounded flare so
I think I already called min this look
this is what the eyes look like with the
lashes on as you can see I thought they
were perfect this look just because
they're nothing too intense and they're
nice and rounded so you can still see
what's going on on the eyes but now
let's move on to the skin so I'm just
gonna take a little wipe and just what a
way they're kind of like fall out okay
so to begin I'm going to moisturize
using the strobe cream and this is in
the peach light edition I literally
forgot how much I love the strobe cream
for Mac it smells so good and I just
think foundation applies really nicely
over the top of it and it gives you a
really good glow underneath and then I
saw that they come up with all these
colors I thought I would try one and I
got the peach one although I can't
really see a massive
like peach tint to my skin or anything
which is kind of good but yeah there was
the same price so I thought I would try
something new and then for primer I'm
just going to leave it super lazy and
use a mac fix+ spray while the skin is
still a tiny bit damp I'm going to go in
with the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation in the shade warm beige just
because it's quite a full coverage
foundation I think my skin would
appreciate a bit of moisture with it too
I'm just gonna pump I look two lines
across my skin and then just above that
in kind of look in a stippling motion
then this you can kind of blend up into
the concealer that you taken down and it
looks or going to another the concealer
I'm going to take the sleek cream a
contour kit in the shade medium and take
the lightest color here and just place
that in like the upside down triangle
motion underneath my eyes to make it
super bright and let's stipple that into
my skin as well
this morphe gunmetal range I've been
obsessing at the moment the brush I used
for foundation was that g36 and this one
is the G 38 little on the forehead as
well I'm not a massive fan of having
like a really bright forehead and then
just a little on the chin then you want
to go ahead and set that one in place
and I'm going to use my awesome a know
kind of powder to do that just because
this is like my absolute favorite powder
for everything once you set in place
nothing's going anywhere it's on a celia
the bare okay once we have set
everything in place with powder I'm
going to go ahead and finish up
underneath my eyes instead of taking one
of the warm matte colors and running
that along my lower lash line with a
pencil brush I could probably normally
would I'm actually going to take the
pigment I used in my eyes and have like
a really it's sparkly lower lash line so
I'm going to take this brush here this
is a Sigma short shade at 8:20 brush and
take a bit of that pigment so I'm going
to take a bit of the pigment on that
brush and then actually spray it with
some at fix+ so it doesn't all like fall
down on my lower lash line or like just
on my under eye area so it has a little
bit of adhesive little bit adhesive 'ti
to it I can never say that word so I'm
just going to press this into my lower
lash line
like so and then I am actually going to
take a pencil brush and the initial
transition color and just run that just
underneath where we put that so it has a
bit of kind of like gradient to it then
I'm going to take this a pencil from
NARS it is called it is their
larger-than-life pencil and it's called
rue de rivoli or something like that
it's well um a spell there
then I just went ahead and did the same
of the other eye and applied a bottom
lash mascara so these are the finish
eyes done I'm obsessed with this glitter
especially with this time of year and
the color scheme this would look so so
gorgeous if you have it brown eyes as
well but now let's finish off the skin
so if a bronzer I'm gonna take the
Bahama Mama bronzer from the balm and
I'm just going to dust this all around
my face using a duo fiber brush just
because I feel like this doesn't apply
it so intensely
publisher I'm going to take this one
from Marc Jacobs it is the lines and
last night blusher is such a gorgeous
peachy color so I think is perfect kind
of complement the green tones on the
eyes
then if the highlight I am taking from
the new Mac Holiday Collection it is the
copper Faye I can't open it there cover
face compact I am it taking this
highlighter here it is whisper of Gale
Anne trees obviously heard of it
honestly I don't know what I've done
without it this whole time but yes I'm
gonna use that as my highlighter
oh now for the lip I think you're going
to hate me because it's a nude again but
I think I there's so much going on on
the eyes I think I don't want to draw
any attention away from them so for me I
personally would wear a nude with this
but I think maybe like a orangie toned
Brown would look really nice
or like a orange --red maybe or even a
pink but for me I really like kind of
like a peachy nude with green so I'm
going to take this lip pencil from is
from a new look and it is in the number
17 and I'm just going to line my lips
with that
then it's the lipstick I'm going to take
this one from makeup forever it is in
the color c104 just a really gorgeous
peachy nude color
and then it Glaus I'm going to go
in with the toothpaste lip injections in
the color milk shape which is like a
really peachy nude and it's got kind of
bits of gold glitter running through it
so I thought that would really tie
everything together so this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
guys like it
I never know what you do kind of greenie
all of you tones just support blue eyes
and I feel like bronzes and stuff suit
them more but because it's the origin
time I really am into like the whole car
key and olive tone theme so I hope you
