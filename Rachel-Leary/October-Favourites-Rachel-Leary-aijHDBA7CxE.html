today i am bringing you i think this is
my first ever favorites type video i
have non beauty and beauty favorites
just cuz I with all the halloween stuff
I've been doing I was doing a lot of
voice and I thought the next video I
want to put up I want to be really
chatty and talk to you guys because i
haven't done one of these videos and
pages and i like its kind of videos I
thought you get to know me a bit better
and you can see some of the stuff I've
been loving not necessarily obviously
like I said beach related there's other
stuff in it too like clothes and shoes
and even like a cushion so just go ahead
and jump into the favorites so I'm going
to start with all the beauty related
stuff first so the first thing I'm
starting with is this palette from above
at 59 it's called the exotic Lotus
palette and you would have seen me use
this in some of my Halloween tutorials
like the wearable one and I think I used
a bit of it in the cat one I just think
let me show you all them I just think
for the Ottoman stuff this has kind of
like every color you could ever want to
create the kind of full looks at every
popular at the moment like them very
light shades the lid shades and like the
warm colors for the crease I just think
it's so lovely I've not owned anything
from velvet 59 previously but this
palette is so pigmented and you can kind
of pop I think you can pop the
eyeshadows out if you wanted to kind of
put them into sleep I'll or something
like that and they're so pigmented and
such gorgeous colors I've been using
this a lot so i thought i would share
that one with you i've been loving it so
the next thing is a recent favorite I've
recently I was gifted a lot of things
from sleek makeup which I think a lot of
you guys know if you can get it in soup
jog or boots or I don't know if you can
get it in America I'm not sure if a
place stocks it but they came out with
this all the lights going to be they
came out with this highlighting palette
and oh my god it's so pigmented let me
show you up close the kind of colors so
these are the kind of colors this one
here is a cream but in these three here
are powders and let me just do one
switches to this one sorry to put my
finger up like it's cool
crazy pigmented for something from that
you fell that's like so cheap I was so
amazed I got this I put on my cheekbones
and I was like holy that's intense
like I had to take half of it off
because I kind of overloaded it but the
packaging i thought was gorgeous as well
and it's such a gorgeous product and
i've only really had it for a week or so
and i just wanted to share that one
because i know there's so many highlight
just going on at the moment like
Anastasia ones and the laura geller
gilded honey and mac have just come up
with some in their new collection so i
just wanted to show you guys a
affordable really amazing highlighters
i'm pretty sure in a video i said if you
guys to recommend me a really good and
like drugstore highlighted because i
didn't actually own one but now i am
recommending this one to you guys
because it's crazy good next is a pair
of eyelashes I feel I'm really late on
the bandwagon with these but these other
Carly lash from the lower lashes and
they're just like the most perfect lash
in my eyes let me show you their wispy
and their wind out and you guys know I
love my eyes to look winged out and kind
of feline like and these ones aren't too
intense either they're so wearable and
so comfortable as well I see a lot of
comments for you guys I'm asking me to
do kind of like how to apply mink lashes
type video so let me know if you guys
would be interested in that just because
I know they can be quite difficult
because the band can be quite thick and
people don't know how to cut them and
stuff so if you guys want me to do look
at how to tutorial on like lashes like
the lower lashes then let me know
because I'd be really happy to do that
for you guys so I know it can be quite
difficult yeah I'm literally in love
with these and my discount code word
villa is finally acted so you guys can
get fifteen percent of the mink lashes
from their website with the code Rachel
Larry and let's save some dollar on
these lashes these honestly these and
like escudo lashes and some of my
favorite eyelashes so I'd love to do a
video and then for you guys and show you
kind of how to apply them cut them easy
tips and tricks on how to maintain them
as well and be I've been loving these
ones next up is a Tom Ford
stick in the shade 05 bear which looks
like this it's like an everyday if you
guys win lustre lipstick to a Mac it's
that kind of consistency I've got it on
at the moment it took a really glossy
everyday color and I've just been
finding myself gravitating towards this
when I'm in a rush or like I don't know
what to wear this is kind of that
lipstick that I know is always going to
look really pretty and it's not too nude
it's still you can see your natural lip
color underneath as you can queen of
town but um no I'm literally in love
with this color and the formula they
smell amazing as well they're a bit
pricey obviously cuz it's Tom Ford but
I've had this for like a good few months
and I've still am I gonna give myself
anxiety doing it look I've still got
loads left I feel like it lasts a really
long time night don't need to keep
reapplying it stays glossy for ages
which is amazing because sometimes a
glossy lipstick she like eat one thing
and it comes off but I finest want to be
really long wearing and I love the color
of this one and if I to be really
hydrating as well especially in the
colder months going into winter I find
my lips are like prone to getting really
dry and chapped so when this one keeps
them really hydrated to last of my
beauty favorites wouldn't be a favorite
if I didn't include some sort of nail
varnish and I haven't actually tried
this one yet but I know it's going to be
a favorite so it's like a future
favorite it's one of the SE Kashmir
matte lips it's nail varnishes um I had
the one in it was the grey one that you
guys were all asking me about when I
last got my nails done and I'm just
loving Matt nails at the moment and this
one is a baby pink and it's got like an
iridescent finish to it which the grey
one did as well this one is called just
stitched so I don't know if you can see
that kind of like reflex to it but
obviously it dries matte so it's like am
at reflux know if that makes sense next
time I get my nails done I am gonna go
for the shade I'm going to show your cuz
I can tell i'm gonna love this so much
now onto mine on beauty favorites so
i've got a few things here and then i'm
going to show you like a couple of songs
i've been nothing and stuff like that
just because i feel like this is more
personality stuff like you'll get to
know me a bit better do too and see the
kind of other things that i like us i'll
see you guys know I'm obsessed with
makeup and stuff but this is like other
stuff you can see the first thing is a
pair of shoes from public desire that my
best friend Anna got me for my birthday
it's just no business so i think i did
when i did coding hall previously I
included a pair of shoes in there that
kind of lace-up run ankle these are
really similar like I love that style of
shoe she knows dense when she did it and
this one is in like a gorgeous car key
color I'm so into kind of colored
accessories rather than wearing brightly
colored clothes I feel like I'd rather
stand up with like a bright lip or a
brightly colored shoe for instance an
acog it's not like a bright color but I
don't wear a lot of a world of
black and white so these are going to
kind of be the color accessory that I
were and I'm literally in love with them
i need to find it time to wear them
because I'm obsessed with the style I
feel like this kind of caged patterns
are any in trend at the moment and
obviously the color is too so thank you
so much Anna beautiful shoes next kind
of clothing item is bodysuits I have
posted a couple of pictures instagram
wearing once previously both from a
store called windsor and i've recently
got two more so i thought i would share
I'm literally in love with them I feel
like they're really complementary and a
really flattering shape on me so the
first one I got it and I'm going to be
wearing this one for halloween because
I'm got one and so durable so I wanted
to get something kind of red so this one
looks like this so yeah it's got that
kind of like that kind of caged front
and this one is from I think it's called
it's called there and Lucy but I think
it if the like store i got it from was
called miss pat or something and but
yeah i think it was really kind of
inexpensive well as well like 20 pounds
but i love the color red and i love this
kind of style so i thought i would share
this one and another one I got is a bit
more wearable for like the day time kind
of depending on how you style it and
it's like um the kind of mall gray it's
the kind of like Willie as well and this
one's from a princess Polly leave you're
watching this thang
you so much she was kind enough to
contact me and gift me with a few things
from her website and this one I just
thought was amazing I think she actually
might have picked this one out for me
could you kind of judged her on my star
and she got it bang on because you'll go
girl yeah it's just as really nice kind
of Willy gray color so kind of more of
like an evening one keep you warm as
well because it's like I said kind of
knitted Willie and I just love the color
I love the style I just love these so
the next thing that is mine on beauty
favorites is this cushion how cute is
this cushion it is covered in different
types of sushi and I thought it would
look like when I do like my chatty type
videos I thought this would look so cute
in the background and not only is it
just an adorable cushion it's actually
designed by one of my friends and it's
for a competition as well so please
please please go check out the links
down below and support my friend Marnie
Cox with this cushion so I'll leave all
the links and everything that you need
to know about it down below I just
thought it was so cute and she designed
it herself she's into like graphic
design I think and stuff like that so I
thought it was amazing that she's done
this competition and come up with her
own cushion it's from the brand oh dear
and I think they were running a design
competition i thought this is incredible
and it's by my friend so I obviously
wanted to support her so like I said
make sure to go check out down below so
my final non Beauty favorite item is
this phone case from Lou me that i got
from princess Polly as well but you're
an avid selfie taker you need this phone
case I'll put it on my phone and show
you guys basically it pops onto your
phone like that I've taken all my broken
phone and it has a button on the back
that basically you press the button and
it lights up like that so if you're in a
club or in the dark and you want to take
a picture and you haven't got the iphone
success that has the flash already
stored in the front selfie camera then
this is amazing I just think it's so
cool anyway i'm finding i'm using this
more than like the torch of my phone to
you like i need a torch
guide myself but I just thought this was
so cool and I'm going to be using this
so much so to conclude this favorites
