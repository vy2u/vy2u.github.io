today I'm doing something way out of my
comfort zone but is probably one of the
most requested videos on my channel and
that is to do a kind of look or in this
case I'm just gonna do a full face
routine with my natural skin which is
slightly more on the pale side now
before I get comments saying that I not
pale or leather there I'm gonna do a
swatch of the foundation that I'm using
in this video
compared to one that I think I used in
my previous video just so you can see
especially if you're new to my channel
the difference in color so that is a
swatch of a foundation that I would wear
if I was tanned which is more on a day
to day basis and that is a swatch of the
foundation I'm going to be using in
today's videos I totally understand that
there's gonna be people even paler than
this and that is totally fine obviously
this is just my pale skin full face
routine so I hope if you guys feel that
you're a similar color to me one more
like this you find new products to use
so if you want to see how I got this
skin look and what products I use then
please keep watching
okay I'm gonna moisturize my skin with
the Bobbi Brown hydrating face cream I
never normally include what moisturizer
I use but this is my favorite one and
has been for ages it sits really nicely
under makeup and I don't find my makeup
slides off after using it even if I
apply it straight away but yeah I'm just
massaging that into my skin and down my
neck as well because it's really
important to keep that area moisturized
also because you do apply makeup there
especially if you blend down so it needs
to be moisturized as well
moving on to primer i'm using the
l'oreal lumi magique primer i use this
one i'm turned or when i'm pale but I do
prefer it slightly when I'm paler
because it has that pearlized finish but
it just gives a really gorgeous glow
underneath your makeup and I always put
in it using the Real Techniques expert
face brush I think this is I just
preferred the way a primer applies with
a brush now the foundation these two are
my favorites it's makeup for ever in n11
7 and Georgia and money in shade 4 but
for today I'm using the Make Up For Ever
one one 7 because it's the paler one and
that one was more suited to my skin as I
was extremely pale this day but I'm I'm
just buffing it into my skin with a damp
Beauty Blender as you can see for once
guys it actually matches the color of my
real face and also my neck because I
described before the tan but now on to
concealer I'm also taking it too this is
the bye-bye under-eye from it cosmetics
in the shade light and this one is so
full coverage I find it best applies
with a finger so you can warm it up
slightly and it becomes a bit easier to
blend and I'm just dabbing that
underneath my eyes on both sides I
wasn't taking it so much all over my
face because it is a full coverage so I
just wanted to concentrate it in areas
that I needed the coverage which was in
this case underneath my eyes taking my
damp Beauty Blender again I'm just
blending that into my skin and then
taking any of the excess products from
the Beauty Blender around on the rest of
my face I like on my chin and on my
forehead to kind of highlight slightly
then taking a matte matte matte prep and
prime pen in a light boost now this one
has a slightly more yellow base to it so
it was gonna warm up my skin slightly
because I was thinking because I was
finding it that I was looking really
ghostly so this just kind of adds a bit
of warmth but it's still pale enough for
me to use and then like I said and like
I did before with the it cosmetics
concealer I am and just buffing that
into my skin and around my face just in
the places I would normally highlight
then to set it all in place I'm taking
my Rimmel clear compact clumb oh my god
clear complexion translucent pressed
powder and I'm taking kind of like a
contour brush to kind of I keep saying
kind of oh my god
to press this into my skin and that's
how I find to get kind of maximum
coverage and the most effectiveness out
of this powder foot bronzer I feel like
this is a step that a lot of people with
paler skin struggle with I find the
mineralized skinfinish from Mac and
medium turn to be the perfect color it's
not too orange it's not too yellow or
anything like that and taking a really
fluffy brush to make sure you're not
concentrating it too heavily on your
cheeks because it's a lot more
noticeable when you have fair skin when
you do a bronzer so having a big fluffy
brush make sure that you apply it really
as softly and it kind of blends it for
you instantly and like I said this color
is not too dark and it's not too orange
and I find it to be the best one for me
when I'm pale but blusher I'm taking
this one from NYX in the shade angel
it's this gorgeous soft pinky peach
color which I think really complements
Ferit skin tones especially if you have
light hair as well I think this looks so
pretty as just a little flush of color
onto the cheeks but nothing too intense
or pigment is that it's gonna really it
stand out against your skin and for
highlight finally I am taking this
strobe powder from hourglass in the
color brilliant light and it's basically
one of those pearlized highlighters I
think sometimes gold highlighters on
fair skin is a little having more of a
pearlized color is a lot more subtle and
these strobing powders and a gloss blend
so so subtly and so nicely into the skin
and I think they're like the perfect
combination when you have a paler skin
and you want that gorgeous glow and just
apply not to the places I would normally
want my highlight to be so my nose and
Cupid's bow and that is the finished
skin look I really hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and found some may be new
products if you're something more on the
pale side that you haven't tried yet or
if you were scared to buy maybe one of
the products that I use and weren't sure
what shade and you think you are similar
