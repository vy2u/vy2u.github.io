to begin this look we are doing our eyes
first I'm going ahead and priming my
eyes this is the Maybelline Color tattoo
init creme de nude and I'm just using
this all over my lid and taking over my
eyebrow to kind of look out the color
then I'm going head and setting
everything in place just with a face
powder this is just gonna make blending
eyeshadows onto our lid so much easier
and make it a lot more kind of smoother
across our lid as well going in with the
more 335 B palette I'm taking this
pastel pink color as our initial
transition shade and just taking a big
fluffy brush and using this back and
forth in our crease
I kind of wanted this I look to be a cut
crease so you guys know the drill I'm
then going in with this kind of pasty
purplish aid basically just one slightly
darker than the pastel pink that we used
to kind of further define the crease and
begin at the cut crease look after
blending those two together I am mixing
these two darker purples together on a
pencil brush and you think this to kind
of create the defining cut crease line
in our socket and I'm just taking up
slightly because I don't want it to be
too too harsh as we can always go back
in to further define it but yeah just
using kind of like a fluffy pencil brush
to create the crease and then going back
in with the previous fluffy brush to
blend out not with any additional
product just using the fluffier side of
things to diffuse any harsh lines
going back in with the Maybelline Color
tattoo we are gonna use this to really
define the crease and clean up the lid
space just in case any of the eye shadow
came down and we want it to be a super
super cut so this is a really handy
trick to do that if you're quite messy
in your crease or you have quite a like
what's the word who did I this helps to
create the illusion of a more cut crease
because you can create your own for the
lid color we are mixing these two
pigments together one is from peaches
makeup called kitten and the other one
is from neve cosmetics called jellyfish
they both kind of have a pasta li
iridescent finish to it which I'm
obsessed with and thought would be
perfect for this look so we're just
gonna go ahead and put this over where
we've just placed down that Maybelline
Color tattoo then like I said we can go
back in with that pencil brush again to
further define the crease and clean up
any of the lid transfer if there wasn't
he or just anything like that if you've
made any mistakes then going back in
with the fluffy brushes again you guys
know sorry I'm kind of getting lower and
lower out of the camera for this but
yeah just using that to make sure
everything is blended seamlessly then I
am at taking it the anastasia beverly
hills moonchild palette and at this
shade here I'm just using that to
highlight the inner corner I went with
the slightly more green toned one
because that's the color I wanted for my
under eye as well then taking a makeup
wipe we're just gonna clean up the edges
to create a sharp line a perfect for our
wing for winged liner I'm taking the
pink NYX vivid brights liquid liner and
just creating it that cat eye wing you
could totally add glitter to this or use
any sort of different color it's totally
up to you
then I am a filling in my eyebrows with
the anastasia beverly hills cream color
a nice blue and a corresponding pencil
and for lashes using the house of lashes
Hollywood glamour lashes and I added
some individuals to the end as well for
the base I'm using the Tarte Amazonian
clay foundation this one is really good
as it is like it implies a full coverage
foundation it's really good for your
skin as well the ingredients are
incredible and like I said gives a
really good full coverage are so perfect
for a base we are going to be going up
with loads of other face products as
well so it doesn't really matter what
foundation use but this is a really good
one
 seal I'm taking the zoeva I think
this is the concealer spectrum palette
and just using this underneath my eyes
as we normally would
to have a brighten well yeah to help
brighten up underneath the under eyes
that's all for the face so you just want
to go ahead and set everything in place
with a powder this is just gonna make
sure that when we go back to finish the
eyes the powders that we use underneath
aren't gonna cling to any cream products
speaking of which I'm taking this a
pencil that we used in the browser it's
from youth cosmetics I think it's called
serenity I'm not sure all the products
I've used by the way I have linked and
listed it down below if I don't say any
names they are all down below but this
is a really gorgeous pastel turquoise
perfect for the waterline and then I'm
taking this turquoise color up from the
same morphe palette and just taking that
underneath my lash line and I'm gonna
drag it down kind of in an upside-down
triangle motion but in this is when you
can get totally creative with whatever
you want you can use whatever color
scheme you want this is just a design
that I came up with and I yet like I
said applying this in a upside down
triangle shape going in with this blue
color Here I am just gonna smudge that
along my lash line I'm not really gonna
take this down onto my face just because
I wanted to use it to define my lower
lash line and create that gradient
effect using Lucky Clover from the
moonchild palette I am just gonna press
this on top of where we placed that
pastel eyeshadow this highlighter had
kind of like a reflex of green it's the
one that we use in our owner corner as
well so it's all tying together as you
can see and this is gonna create like an
iridescent green finish to the face kind
of look like scales well that's kind of
what I had in my mind anyways now a time
to just tie your hair back because we
are gonna be using a wig so I am just
tying my hair in a low bun just because
if I thought if I did a high bun it'd be
way obvious and then I'm applying the
wig cap that comes with the wig that I
bought but realistically it's almost
like one of those tight pops up so you
can just use one of them if you have one
of those I'm just kind of tying my hair
up now because we are gonna be doing
kind of perimeter face skin makeup so I
can blend the makeup into my hairline
I'm going in with like a contour brush
and mixing loads of the purple shades
from that morphe palette and I'm kind of
applying this where you would apply a
bronzer but like
extra Lily Lily as you can see like
obviously wouldn't want your content to
be that harsh but as this is kind of
costume makeup you cannot be as playful
and creative as you want I am using one
of the kind of more iridescent purple
shades in the palette because I think
that has a really nice finish to it then
I'm at just going hammer with that
moonchild palette and just dipping this
brush into loads of the different shades
I think this was the slightly darker
blue along so I thought it would
complement the purple I'm just using
that over the top and just creating the
kind of skin effect that I'm after again
using that anastasia beverly hills
moonchild palette I'm taking the shade
pink heart I think this is and kind of
placing this between the turquoise and
the purple so we do have a highlighter
and it just kind of blends and merges
those two colors together using a Mac
the magenta shade from the same multi
palette I'm using this to further define
the contour and blend it up just as I
felt like it got a little bit lost and I
do kind of want to have defined ish
cheekbones so I'm just using a purple
shade to create that on a fluffy crease
brush then this is the fun part you can
take a makeup brush and this is just
some micellar water I'm using this to
create the scale effect and by doing
this I'm literally almost creating a
patchwork effect just doing diagonal
lines and then diagonal lines in the
opposite direction to kind of mimic the
appearance of scales so super super easy
and looks really effective then going in
with a cotton bud there is nothing on
this I'm just applying a bit of pressure
and going over the places I went with
the makeup brush and the micellar water
just to kind of dry up and really kind
of get rid of any product on there and
it'd be really defined and noticeable
then again the fun part you can pick
your glitters I really recommended this
mermaid glitter I've linked it down
below I think it looks the most
realistic but I'm also going in with
some sparklers from makeup geek and then
this random glitter I just found in my
drawer with the same sort of color
scheme I'm using the Too Faced glitter
glue and
using a brush to apply it to my skin and
just place basically in the places that
I want the glitter to stay so totally up
to you I'm just using a fluffy brush to
apply them as well this is the mermaid
glitter I was talking about it really
looks like scales so if you're going for
a mermaid look I really recommend this I
think you can get it from a source I'm
not 100% sure but I believed it down
below and I have tagged it in my
Instagram to be a just go crazy be
creative and do whatever design you want
you could totally apply this underneath
the eyes as well which I think if I was
to ever recreate this look again I would
do that too but yet just applying the
glitter wherever you want to create that
scaly effect
then on a fluffy brush I'm just dipping
it into that moonchild palette again
can't even remember what color it was
probably all of them I was just going
crazy with it I am it just applying that
all over my face again to kind of imply
the pastel scaly iridescent skin finish
then for the lips I'm taking a good
timing at pro long wear lip pencil from
Mac and then I really wanted a a pastel
pink lip so I'm going in with the Too
Faced melted matte in Miss Posie or
something it's along those lines I have
named it down below as you can see it's
super super pale pink but we are gonna
kind of mummify it in a second again
with the moonchild palette I'm just
taking a fluffy brush and mixing it the
green the shade and the blue shade and
just literally dousing my lips in it so
almost using that as like a lip topper
now it's time for the wig this is the
pastel pink ombre synthetic wig from
everyday wigs calm I have a link then
down below they have such incredible
wigs they feel so real and they look so
realistic as well this one even had like
an ombre so it looked really realistic
as well I've linked them down below too
now just to finish off I am just adding
the cocoa brown go a little bit golden
goddess oil to my body to give me kind
of more of a shimmery effect and then
going in with the anastasia beverly
hills moonchild palette again on a just
like a big brush and applying loads and
loads of different shades to my skin to
create that mimic oh my god I can't even
talk to mimic the effect that I've done
on my face essentially and it to be more
realistic on my body as well and then I
think I went actually in to that
iridescent purple shade from the morphe
palette just for a bit more color and
definition and then I went in with that
two-faced glitter glue again and the
mermaid glitter so the scales would
translate onto my body as well
so this is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial give
it a thumbs up if you did and make sure
to subscribe if you haven't already and
definitely share it with your friends
I've seen so many mermaid looks going
around at the moment I just think
they're so pretty so definitely more of
a wearable Halloween idea so yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and I will see you in the next
one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
