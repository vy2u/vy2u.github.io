hey guys welcome back to my channel so
I'm feeling a bit approached they I'm
obviously in like a bit of a different
setting and that is because I'm
currently filming this in Los Angeles in
the NYX HQ which is super cool for me
and they were kind enough to let us film
any sort of video that we wanted and I
thought I've been showcasing all these
new NYX products on like my snapchat and
stuff and I wanted to do a tutorial kind
of using them all on getting you excited
to them so I really hope you guys like
this look I went for something like soft
pink and stuff I'm showcasing some new
eyeshadows the new foundation which is
amazing a new cream highlighter and all
that good stuff as well as like the
liquid liner so yeah I really hope you
guys enjoyed this look I'll leave the
names of everything it down below so you
can get excited for them and write them
down like on your wish list when they
come out
yeah so if you like to look at this
makeup look then make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and please keep
watching
okay so to begin I'm going to go in with
one of these these are new beyond nudnik
shallowed and this one is in the color
frisky I think that it's just a really
nice warm orange color to start and if
you guys know the NYX
Prismatic eyeshadows they like them but
there are a whole range of matte colors
which i think is so cool and you guys
know I love warning tones as well so
which is starting with this one as our
initial color and they're super
pigmented as well so you don't need a
huge amount on your brush that every
time I pick up a color I am cutting
quite a bit of it off like that and then
I'm going to go in with a slightly
darker color this is more of a pinky
color again it is a matte shade and this
one is in the color makes me blush we're
going to go with a slightly Pinker seam
today on the eyes something a little bit
different I'm going to take a slightly
smaller crease brush as well and just
you know do what I normally do slowly
define the crease a bit more and bring
it slightly further across the lid as
well so you get that gradient effect I
really like this color because it looks
quite pink but I feel like it's almost
like a warm to Lummi color I prefer
those kind of turned my eyes going
anything too drastic you can build it up
as much as you want it's a good thing
about these shades they're really
available like that I would say and then
I'm just going to start to deepen up the
crease again this is another one of the
new matte shades this one's a really
nice warm brown and it is called Nazca
day and again I'm just going in with a
slightly smaller brush my brushes get
smaller and smaller every time just
because the amount of product in putting
on is kind of getting less and less and
it means I can be a bit more precise I'm
just concentrating this mainly on the
outer part I don't want it to be too
dark and dramatic because that's not the
kind of look I want to do today
we could also so great when your eyes
self water now to go back and you guys
know I haven't picked up any additional
product I just like to use the brush too
defuse all the colors together okay so I
think I'm done for like the crease
colors but I'm going to go in with this
this is one of the next prismatic
shadows this one's not new but it is
where my favorites a really nice soft
pink color called girl talk I think I've
used it in a tutorial before I'm just
using it as a base because we're going
to go in with something like a bit more
glittery on the top I'm just going to
pack that on kind of obviously the empty
space that I've left I always like to
look down and then I can kind of use the
end of my brush as you can see it's like
really then as I get to towards the
shadows I just like to tap that way I
feel like it blends a lot better and you
don't get that sudden like harsh stop
start between the two like that it's
going to go back in with that brush that
we use the darkest color and just make
sure everything blend it out okay now
I'm going to go in with this NYX glam
liner it's like a baby pink don't think
this is a brand new product but it is
new for me I saw it and I was like oh my
god I need it so if you can get your
hands on it definitely do I think they
had loads of colors to choose from and
this is in the color glam pink so I'm
just going to go ahead and just brush
this basically over where I just put
that pink eyeshadow and I find it easy
to kind of look down and take a little
Meritage cookie if you've got one
and just like literally paint on
concentrate most of the products in like
your inner corner and then as you get
further and further out Chris you want
to blend in with your other eyeshadows
just kind of lighten your pressure
slightly so then it diffuses a lot
better it just kind of use like little
motions
like that and then I'm just going to go
in with of white and just clean up
underneath and kind of wing it out
because we are going to do a wing and I
you guys know I always said she's a
white and make it look easier for myself
give yourself a nice and base before I
do my winged liner I'm just going to
highlight my inner corner I'm going to
take this color from the stroke of
genius palette that palette is not new
but I love it and I love this color for
the inner corner as well and since we're
really going to be using it okay I'll
use on the inner corner as well okay so
once we've done that now we can do our
winged liner and I'm going to use the
NYX epic ink liner pen to do this this
is new right okay so this is brand new
and one is the most pigmented winged
liner oh my god I've got it up winged
liner pen side users you'll see I'm just
going to start by going kind of across
the lid and then I like to see my wing
and go in a bit more you guys know and
what I really really like about this one
is that it's like a matte black a lot of
liner pencil I use on a really shiny
black but this one is like epic black
like it says and a liner pen if you're
not very confident with doing liner is
so good for getting like inner corners
and details and stuff because it has a
permanent point where sometimes when I
use like a gel and a brush sometimes
there's so much kind of gel liner on the
brush I can't get it like precise enough
so once you kind of happy with like the
thickness across like to see the base
and then
connect it back and that's a good thing
again about doing your eyes first
because if I just want to be kind of
like perfect it I can just wipe away
underneath without ruining my thing okay
now I'm just going to go ahead and do
mascara and lashes and the mascara I'm
just using is Viet NYX double-stacked
mascara just going to fly a like and for
lashes I'm also going to using NYX
lashes and these are from that there be
wicked veins and these in the style
popular they're not new either but I
never really use neck slashes and I have
really got to experience them acceptance
from like being here and I really like
this one Deb really like and if you can
see okay like spiky I'm going to be very
annoying and say they're dramatic but
natural at the same time
hello haha I feel like they give just
enough drama but they're not too much
okay while my eyelash is drying I'm
really quickly going to apply a primer
this is the NYX hydro touch primer just
like give my skin some time to like
absorbing
Oh smiles really nice - it smells like
them that like voice now but this Prime
is really good if you've got dry skin
because it's got like a really gel feel
to it well have no stop these those that
they have a thick band if it's the first
time wearing them defo give them like a
good few bends 20 foot long
now I'm going to go onto my skin angular
okay this is new and this is like my
favorite thing at this whole video this
is the NYX total control what color
foundation is basically you'll see it's
so liquidy but amazing coverage matte
finish last all day looks so good in
pictures so when this comes out oh my
god buy it in like every color but you
can see I am two different colors right
now so this look like a really drastic
and it always does and someone will tell
me that it's not my color but it project
the color I would have been system I'm
just kind of drop it straight onto my
face and I'm going to show you that was
kind of just whoops
one kind of pump
also another thing about this foundation
is the color range I know a lot of
people I a lot of people don't like
drugstore foundations because they could
never find their color like the range is
never wide enough this one has how many
shades are in this range do you know 24
24 okay so once you get done the
foundation I'm gonna do my concealer I'm
just using my NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade canal I think in
places oh wait yeah I'm going to place
this in all the places I want to
brighten up I don't like to take it all
the way up like my lash line because
then I feel like that's when it creases
so I'm then gonna take will concealer
brush and just take it really up to the
wing now and that just really sharpens
it up and it means I don't have to like
dab my Beauty Blender really close and
like potentially ruin it all
and then it's going to go in with my
Beauty Blender and blend all that out
then I'm just going to bake underneath
my eyes using my Laura Mercier powder I
like to take it up and like the sides of
my nose a little bit because that kind
of gives the illusion of a slightly
skimmer nose right Oh Mike why need to
wait for that dries right I'm just going
to brush away I'm just going to go back
in and finish off the eyes I'm going to
go back in with that matte pinky color
on a just on a little pencil brush and
just smoke it out so I'm just going to
go in with my school
and that's the eyes finished you guys
these matte shadows they come in pan
form as well so you can kind of custom
create your own palette and they're so
good they're so blended there's so many
colors I think as well like some bright
ones as well you guys said that you
really liked that blue look I posted my
Instagram the other day they've got like
a really nice electric blue as well okay
to finish off my face I'm going to take
the NYX palette and contour palette I'm
just going to take just slightly longer
shade here I'm going to use that just to
lightly contour obviously by the way
pre-warning you've never used this
before so pigmented so if you don't want
to you know change race and maybe be
quite light with your product placement
see I barely had anything on that brush
sister and I feel like some people would
tell me this is quite a harsh run and
then I'm going to take this color this
is slightly more cooler tone one and I
think the lightest one so if you're
slightly fair I probably would have used
that as like my cheek contour but I'm
getting used to this actually as my nose
contour I think it's a lot more like
realistic as it mimics the appearance of
a shadow a lot more than a warmer color
does and you can take a kind of flop
fluffier ha fluffy
ish brush and go take it down the center
then to warm up kind of the best of my
fav I'm going to go in with the NYX you
know so to powder this is actually like
a face powder and this is in the shade
golden really comparable to take the max
mineralized skinfinish is you I know
what you guys know I love the like dark
golden Minari skin finish from mac as a
bronzer so these are so like a really
good dupe for that I'm just going to
take it on like a really big fluffy
brush because I don't want to be too
like precise with it it's just kind of
blend the contour slightly and just warm
everything up I always find powders that
are slightly darker than your skin tone
make really really great bronzers
because they're meant to blend better
because technically it's at the face
powder just but for someone's slightly
darker than you okay so once I've done
that I'm actually going to go in with a
bit more like a pinky blush that I
normally would today I'm going to take
the NYX sweet cheeks palette and I get
it I think I'm going to mix these two it
together just because we've got like a
pink sky going on a kind of we're
coordinating with that so I'm just going
to take those two okay now on to
highlight I'm going to take the new next
blow me away liquid highlighter they
again have a huge range of colors D some
of them are a lot more bronze eeeh this
one is definitely more of a champagne
gold and it is called daytime halo and I
find if you want your highlight to
really like pop putting a cream on
underneath and then going in with a
powder makes like such a difference so
I'm just going to dispense that on the
back of my hand
and then take my singular you don't want
to go on with too much to start with it
so much easier to add more than it is to
take away and I feel like if you go in
with too much cream once you've done a
bit of powder that's when it can start
to separate so I've literally got like
you can see the tiniest amount on my
finger and I'm just going to really
lightly press it on the tops of my
cheeks let's just kind of take up on my
temples as well
it does come with like a ones like this
but I find if I like we literally
painted that on something drastic would
happen so I was at to put it on my hand
just loads of little like presses I
never ever like to drag any liquids
across my face I've already done powders
because that's what I think again start
separating essentially I'm just kind of
like priming anywhere that I normally
put a powder highlighter so once I've
done that like if they're going to go
into powder highlighter going in with
Dean straight with genius palette again
I'm going to mix these two colors
together on a Mac two to four one of my
favorite brushes for highlighting just
because the bristles are quite firm so
it really like packs it on one of my
favorite products to use the
highlighting cuz they're really what's
the word like creamy for a powder and I
always like to kind of put it here as
well that looks really pretty in
pictures if you like highlight the
between your brows
yeah I think that if spin done and now
on to lips I'm going to take the next
lips lingerie in babydoll this shade
isn't a brand new one but they are
coming out with loads of newer colors
in the next lingerie range I think a lot
more like a brownie colors a lot more
cool tone colors which is really cool
but this one is obviously like a pinky
nude you thought it would go this looks
oh and you hadn't tried these before
it's basically just arranged dedicated
to nudes of all shades so there's no
excuse not to find your panic on and I'm
going to go in with an old favorite this
is the butter gloss in a fortune cookie
and these look so nice just on their own
for like everyday and stuff that I'm
just going to put this over the top
and that is the finished look so this is
the finished look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video I know it's obviously
it's something slightly different from
me some of the mix products I mentioned
and new they are all coming out late in
the year
some are sooner than others so
definitely follow NYX UK on Instagram
but kind of like all the updates is when
they come out and staff I kind of just
wanted to do this video to get you guys
excited for them and obviously showcase
some of the new products I got to test
when I was in LA with them so yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
