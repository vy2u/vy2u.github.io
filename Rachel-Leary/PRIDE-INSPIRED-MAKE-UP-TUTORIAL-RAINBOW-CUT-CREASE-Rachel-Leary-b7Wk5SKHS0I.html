everything that has been going on in the
world right now I asked you guys on
Twitter look what you want the firmly
views is colorful and when I think of
colorful I just think of you know like
everything just reuniting together if
you have a rainbow a blend of colors and
with it being the Pride Month as well I
want to kind of create a look inspired
by that and just something to kind of
symbolize all that good stuff
so I went for something cuticle at all I
feel like color also represents
happiness as well and that's what we
need to be spreading so yeah I really
hope you guys appreciate this makeup
look and the kind of message I had
behind it will be my love of makeup it's
coming my way of just showing my support
diamond surrender which is the makeup
they're using but I'm just I'm German
support and kind Cymbeline D&amp;amp;C and with
it being my month it just makes me so I
have actually enjoyed unclear lips
options within I always be quite like
ice cream and glued it just returns the
eyes are super powerful I feel like it
doesn't draw attention away but if
you're going to any sort of pride or
anything or you just love a bright lip
and bright eye or anything I've thrown
in an option that for you or you can
just do what any color will do Grizz
literally whatever so if you like the
look of this makeup look then definitely
make sure to give it a thumbs up and
definitely hit that subscribe button in
your nooks I would love to see you in my
next video but without further ado let's
go ahead again so to begin I'm going to
do my eyebrows using anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow in a blonde I literally
haven't used this in ages but I wanted a
slightly more sculpted a brow so you
guys know the way I do it I always like
to start like three courses the way
through create detail and then it
feather up the front and then so I
primer I'm going to use the Urban Decay
Eden primer potion just look at this one
almost represents like a concealer kind
of color so I also use it to it sculpt
out underneath my eyebrows as well and
then I just use a brush to bust the rest
in and to finally set my brows I'm
taking beat lore'l brow artist plumper
in the shade light/medium I think then
I'm just going to set the point in place
with a powder so all the eyeshadows that
we put on the top are going to blend
super easily and now onto the eyeshadows
i'm take
the morphe 35c palette this is literally
my favorite eyeshadow palette for any
colorful look pretty literally contains
any color and just taking a small angled
brush and kind of taking the colors of
the rainbow so starting with red and
then orange and then yellow I am using
the same brush every time I am making
sure to wipe it clean though and then
just creating that cut crease don't ask
you why does help a lot but actually
don't know I did try to do it at the end
but then I ran out of room and then I'm
basically going to do exactly the same
thing but this time with a pencil brush
to create more of like more color in
fact makes sense and then I can just
above that in so making sure it's all
blended together I am then taking a
clean blending brush making sure there's
literally nothing on it and blending or
the colors together kind of using anti
clockwise motions and just making sure
it's all what blended and bussed in then
taking this white eyeliner from
maybelline I'm creating that cut crease
look don't worry if you're a bit messy
because I'm going to go back in with the
primer as you'll see here and just clean
it all up and making sure there is no
shadow on the lid either and then like I
said just using it to clean up the
eyeliner so it's the same thickness all
the way across to set that in place I'm
just mixing it be white and the cream it
shades together from the C palette and
then it taking this a glitter eyeliner
from Urban Decay I'm just going over the
white eyeliner just to give it a bit
more glitter and that's a bit more
creative then I am it taking the white
to highlight my inner corner and then
I'm going to go in with liquid eyeliner
and this is be a Tarte double take
liquid eyeliner but first you guys know
I'd like to clean up underneath my eyes
to give myself a space I literally love
this eyeliner is so black and it is so
precise and I wanted it to be quite
thick so obviously if you have a
slightly smaller lid space you can make
it dinner do whatever you want I just
haven't done a sickling in ages and I
forgot how much I love them so just kind
of going over the top creating the wing
and then connecting it back in and then
on the bit of a perfectionist so if it's
not as sharp as you want it to be you
can go in with a wipe just to make sure
that the point is super sharp now
mascara I'm using it the new at
Maybelline big shot colossal mascara I
love this I'm just lightly coating them
you can just wear mascara if you want
the eyes to be more visible but
obviously I'm going to apply lashes and
I
love these these are the SCE toes
celestial lashes I can't read pronounce
them but look I just think they complete
the look so well and now we can move on
to the skin this is the l'oreal
hydrogenous cream and i'm just using
that as my moisturizer today because it
leaves my skin it's super soft and it's
a really nice base for primer and makeup
does anybody else do a superb primer
this is the Nivea post shave balm on
which we just dabbing it and pouring it
on it to my face and then buffing it in
with my Real Techniques as this is the
multitask face brush you have now I like
to apply my primers with that brush I
just feel like it gives them more even
consistency and for foundation today I'm
mixing at these two Anastasia Beverly
Hills Foundation sticks one in the war
might one in the color war mat tan and
one in the shade caramel I'm definitely
using more of the warm tan just because
it's more of the lighter color that
suits my skin so caramel one just a
slightly more Oliver undertone which
complements my tan a bit more so I'm
just buffing that in with a damp Beauty
Blender it looked like I applied loads
for the kind of consistent give this
isn't that pigmented size you can apply
quite a lot and now for concealer I'm
dipping into an old favourite this is
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer in nw20 I
did one quite a bright under eye and I'm
just applying it with my fingers just
because this is the one thing I hate
about this concealer I don't really know
how to apply it without just going
straight onto my fingers but then I do
take a little concealer brush and go
right up underneath the eyeliner just to
really sharpen it up so I don't have to
do that with my sponge and then I'm just
blending that in with the same at Beauty
vents that I used for my foundation now
to set everything in place with powder
then it's a contour limit taking the Kat
Von D at contour wait the shade and
light palette and the slightly warm up
contour shade and I'm it just using it
back to contour my cheekbones and then
just a little bit on my nose to add a
bit more definition to my face basically
just a slim everything down and then I
blend in my nose contour with my Beauty
Blender then for bronzer I'm it taking
the approximate Tahiti bronzer I love
this bronzer in literally at blend so
easily it literally feels like a butter
or velvet on your skin and it smells
amazing as well it's such a gorgeous
warmer color I've been really reaching
to live at the moment if you haven't
tried it
finnaly recommender serve Russia ima
take immediate benefit cosmetics at
California glacier I love this again
such a gorgeous peachy pink color and it
has kind of a so-called reflex running
through it so I thought it really
complemented the look and suited my eye
color and for highlighter I wanted to be
popular in it today
so I am seeking to be a Mac actually to
mention it skin finish in the shade
double cream I think it is I've linked
everything it down below but as you can
see it literally is philemon and theme
in and type enough my cheekbones and I
also applied it on my nose and Cupid's
bow as well to finish off my eyes I'm
taking the new Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
eyeliner in the shade vivid I'm sorry I
think it was part of their newer
collection and I wanted to use
complementary colors underneath so I
used my favorite pairing which is orange
and blue for taking the orange from the
same at morphe palette and just buffing
that on at my lower lash line and then
just applying a fotomat lash of mascara
for the lips I wanted to give you two
options I wanted to give you something
really a bright just to kind of throw
the whole colorful ski in it so this is
Mac cherry lip pencil and via color pop
matte liquid lipstick in the shade
little weapon but then if you just
wanted something simple on the lips
because the eyes are too colorful for
you or you just kind of didn't want to
take any attention away I went in with
an old traffic this is oak lips pencil
and Miss lipstick
both from mac cosmetics so nothing that
was going to take any attention away and
just a simple nude so this was the
finished makeup look I really hope you
