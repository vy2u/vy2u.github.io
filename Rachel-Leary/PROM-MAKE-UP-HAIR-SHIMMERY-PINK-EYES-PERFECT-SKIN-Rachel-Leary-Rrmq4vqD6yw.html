sorry that I didn't upload a video on

installment as you can tell by the title
and the thumbnail this is a very soft
glam look definitely more of like the
pink vibes so many of you guys asked for
more of a pink tone look and I feel like
it's just because it complements our so
many dresses and so many eye colors and
skin tones so this is just my first
installment and the art doing just a
simple complimentary hair look as well
we are gonna be doing a makeup then have

so much for subscribing hit in the

but without further ado if you would
like to see this kind of DIY is super
easy flawless skin pretty shimmery pink
eye God what a mouthful prom tutorial
with hair included at the end then
please keep watching
okay so we're gonna start with our
makeup first but let me just clarify I
am wearing a bodysuit but it just cuts
out down there and my hair kind of
covers the strap so let's just pretend
we're nicking it in a key so to prep our
skin I'm gonna be using this moisturizer
I've been loving it at the moment I used
in my previous video I think it's the
hyaluronic marine oil at fusion of
moisture cushion via dr. Dennis gross I
love this because like it says it's oil
free but it really has that wet skin
moisturizing finish which you guys know
I love I can't remember if I said this
in my previous video a lot of pro makeup
artists don't really use primers like
whenever I'm at a master class and
someone says what's the best primer they
say that they don't even use one and
recently I've just been using this
moisturizer plus the next product that
I'm going to be using and I find that my
makeup stays on just as well so maybe
primers aren't necessarily necessary by
the way just adds up I do have kind of
normal to dry skin so that might be why
but the next product I'm going to be
using is from a touch insole it's called
I'm very useful makeup boomer it looks
like this it almost looks like strobe
cream from Mac I think it does have some
priming qualities too but I have just
been loving the way that this looks in
combination with that moisturizer this
just adds the most gorgeous glow to my
skin as you will see but it doesn't
really leave much of the tak I feel like
it is kind of oil-free which might be
why it has those priming qualities to it
so makeup sits really nicely on the top
I just think for prom you want your skin
to just look really kind of full
coverage but as natural as it can and
like glowy as it can you just want your
skin to look perfect and I find when I
wear this just has the most like a
gorgeous glow from with which i think is
just perfect for prom skin I'm probably
gonna be using this a quite a lot
throughout the video but I'm now just
gonna spray my skin with the Mac prep
and prime fix plus spray but this is the
gold light version as you can see it's
got kind of like shimmer running all the
way through it I always do see love
using the original mac fix+ just kind of
before I apply it my makeup because it
has re-emerging hydrating and priming
qualities to it so this one's just gonna
give us a little bit of a glow that's
totally an extra step that you do need
to take but you know it's prom we want
to be feeling special
glowy radiant glorious and beautiful on
to foundation I have been loving this
one I think it's a perfect foundation
for prom this is the NARS I think
natural radiant long wear foundation I
love this I love the finish of it it's
so full coverage but almost in like a
really natural way as in it doesn't feel
too heavy on the skin I feel like the
finish is a gorgeous like satin to matte
finish
more on the satiny side and then in
combination with that skin can
underneath it just gives the most
beautiful finish and I feel like it
lasts all day as well hence the long
wear in at the title and I actually read
an article somewhere that says if you're
doing photography you should wear two to
three times the amount of makeup that
you usually would just because camera
flash and my all that kind of stuff the
the lighting they almost reduce it
almost visually looks as if you're
wearing less makeup with more lights
that you have so obviously when it's
prom and stuff you're gonna be having so
many pictures taken which is kind of why
I don't really do sort of like natural
products I think that's kind of
unrealistic I want you guys to look the
best that you can and unfortunately
wearing more makeup kind of means that
you will look slightly better in like
pictures and stuff it's just the way
that it works in terms of photography
but obviously I wouldn't you guys to
feel comfortable too
if you're not come forward huge amount
of makeup that doesn't matter either but
for me personally slap it on baby so
that was only like two teeny pumps on
either side and I feel like that's
covered my whole face and giving me
amazing amazing coverage I love this
foundation now moving on to concealer
I'm gonna be a taking the append fab
concealer I love this stuff it reminds
me of the LA pro girl concealer I think
it's really a full coverage and blends
amazingly I am gonna actually gonna be
doing a full face of Nippon fab Brooks
and very very
soon-im get me working with them on this
they feel like you wanna really talk
about their makeup so much and I went to
their master class with Mario he is one
of their brand ambassadors and it's so
good I feel like people are sleeping on
it so I want to bring it to you guys to
show you guys all of their amazing stuff
but yeah I'm just gonna be using their
concealer right now and I'm using this
in the shade 20 because for prom I don't
really want to have a bright under I
thought there's so many opportunities
for that to go wrong you know you get
like flashback some pictures or anything
like that so this is the shade 20 it
kind of matches with my skin color
really nicely is the tiniest bit lighter
which I really really appreciate it just
does an amazing job of concealing
underneath my eyes kind of blurring any
imperfections and that brush applicator
makes it so easy to apply or if you're
having like a winged outlook that brush
applicator is really a good hurt
sharpening up those edges next up is a
cream contour it's one of my favorite
steps ever I love a cream bronze cream
contour from is no exception I feel like
this is like one of the best ways to
ensure like a flawless looking contour
on your skin and I'm gonna be using the
makeup revolution of fast base
foundation stick in the color f13 I love
the way this blends out the color is
perfect and the application is so so so
easy
and like I said this blends like a dream
and it's only a fiber I feel like the
color just blends really nicely into the
base that I already have down it doesn't
leave too much of like a bronzer
helmet or anything I'm not left with
like really drastically pigmented
foundation that I'm having to work
really hard to blend
don't forget the chin area I once did
that literally did my whole makeup look
to the mirror and realized I hadn't
blended out my chin and jaw contour that
was a close one now I'm gonna go ahead
and set everything with powder and then
do my eyebrows so for powder I'm gonna
be taking this new up powder from
hourglass I've been really loving the
finish of this anything I don't really
like is how I have to like dispense it
but this powder is amazing it gives such
a natural finish the skin feels really
like waiting just kind of looks and sets
everything in place so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that I'm also going to go
ahead and do my brows you want something
that's gonna last a long time and that
you feel comfortable with don't be
playing with any new brow products for
prom because we all know we can get
carried away and you don't want to slugs
on your forehead in your pictures so I'm
just gonna go ahead and use my Anastasio
beverly hills dipbrow in dark brown and
i'll be right back to finish up the face
okay so the brows are done the face is
set now we can continue so I'm gonna
just contour my cheeks I feel like that
cream bronzer has kind of bronzed up my
skin enough so I'm just gonna be adding
a little bit more definition and I'm
just gonna be using the Maybelline
master sculpt and just taking the
contour shade it's a nice cool taina
color I'm just kind of just adding that
definition to anywhere that you just
want to make a little bit smaller you
know so if you think your foreheads
looking a little chunk just apply it to
the perimeters and that will really help
to mimic the appearance of a slightly
smaller warhead I'm gonna go ahead and
just do turn the sides of my nose as
well this is a really kind of like soft
color so I don't feel like you can go
too wrong in terms of nose contour I
know sometimes people can go a little
bit heavy with this products really nice
it's not too too pigmented and you can
really build it up I'm gonna go ahead
and apply a blusher I feel like prom is
the perfect time for blusher and this
one is so pretty this one is by Milani
it is called Dolce pink I feel like that
my views this a couple of times before
it has it the most gorgeous like flush
of gold running through it and it's just
I feel like the perfect prom blusher
especially because we're going for sort
of more of a pink eye I feel like this
is gonna really tie everything together
and it has a really gorgeous below as
well just a little soft tip a little
soft pinky oh you know you know and
finally moving on to that glow you guys
know I love to use like a liquid
illuminator and then apply a pressed
powder highlighter on the top for that
extra pop and I feel like it just shows
up a lot better in pictures obviously
what you want for promise so I'm going
to be taking the iconic
Londyn eliminating drops and this is in
the original shade and I'm just gonna be
taking my blank canvas cosmetics ether
teen brush it's literally my favorite
brush to blend out liquid highlighters
or like cream highlighters it's a nice
synthetic small blender brush and just
buffing that in of my cheekbones just
kind of taking any of the excess onto my
forehead or anything like that this
blends really nicely on top of makeup it
doesn't kind of leave an obvious you
know mark or like some cream products do
and I know that's why some people get a
little bit scared to apply them after
they've set their face with powder I
just kind of use circular motions and
her buff it back in took my hairline I
know some people like to do their hair
first but I thought just for the order
of this tutorial I'll do my makeup first
so now a lot of people might just be
watching this for the makeup and then
obviously if you want to do your hair
too at the end then feel free yeah just
blending that into the skin and you
could just leave it like that but you
know me I like mahalo to be poppin so a
full highlight I'm going to be taking it
the revolution at pro at 4k highlighter
palette this is in the pool this is in
the gold edition and I am just going to
be taking that gorgeous champagne color
just there on my zoeva luxe powder
fusion brush and just buffing that on
top Oh sometimes if I feel like that's
like to pavement it or too much we'll
just go in with my sponge and just help
to it diffuse that out slightly but
because you have that cream highlighted
down you barely need to pick up any
powder product and it really just kind
of clings to the cream and acts as a
really incredible base and just really
makes anything that you put on the top
just pop I'm also going to put it on the
end of my nose just kind of down the
bridge of my nose and I like you could
bow just all the places that like
already are quite prominent and stand
forward I'm
super happy with the way that my skin
looks now and that's literally it the
skin I'm now gonna go ahead and laugh
I'm now gonna go ahead and spray my skin
with the fix+ gold light again this
literally leaves my skin looking so
flawless it really just gets rid of any
powder defects on the skin and because
it's the gold light version actually
adds a gorgeous glow treat the skin I'm
gonna spray my skin with this and then
we can move on it to the eye makeup oh
my god I just I love the smell effects
plus as well okay so for the eyes I did
kind of want to try and do everything
from one palette and I was thinking what
palette can I use I feel like everyone
might have and it's got every kind of
color in it so I did go for the Jaclyn
hill morphe palette I haven't used this
in a minute and we're gonna be kind of
sticking to the more top two rows in
terms of Pink's or whatever but there's
so many colors in this palette that you
can just take the techniques from this
and use whatever colors that you want
but we are going for like a pink kind of
shimmery sparkly theme just because I
thought that would kind of tie in with
so many different colored dresses this
is also a really nice I makeup to kind
of complement any eye color as well so
let's go ahead and get started
so to begin excuse how a battered this
palette looks I'm gonna be mixing these
two colors together as our initial
transition color we're kind of gonna be
going for something very soft and
natural I do plan to do more prom looks
just because I know this might not go
with everyone's prom dress I want to do
as many as I can
I love them so much I plan to do one or
for a red dress I plan to maybe do a bit
more of a heavy glam one so just let me
know in the comment section down below
what your prom dress color is and what
kind of look you'd want to go for I
definitely feel like I need to do like a
champagne and gold one I feel like
that's kind of pretty common for most
people but I'm just taking Mike one of
my favorite crease brushes ever this is
from blank canvas cosmetics it's that
e20 it just that she fits in the socket
and it's kind of big but precise at the
same time and it just
blend everything out like a dream taking
a slightly a smaller brush this is a
zoeva luxe soft definer 2 to 7 I'm just
gonna be mixing these two shades here to
further deepen up the sucker
look like I said we're gonna be keeping
it fairly soft nothing too dark as you
can see and I know you just saw a wing
there but I didn't actually do it using
eye shadow and I feel like that's just a
really easy soft way to kind of add a
little something extra to your eye look
without the pressure of like liquid
liner or anything because shadows are so
much easier to work with and blend out
if you were to make any mistakes but
after just kind of placing that into the
crease I just go back in with my
previous brush no additional product
just kind of using it to soften
everything out and then the final color
we're going to be using is this one here
as you can see it's kind of like a pink
toned Brown so perfect for this look I'm
just gonna be taking a small amount of
that on at a a precise fluffy brush and
defining the crease just that little bit
further I do feel like these movia tones
are really complementary and perfect for
prom as well I think they're just a
little bit more like I don't know more
natural maybe a little bit softer in
tone but they've still got that warmth
to and that kind of complements most eye
colors yeah just kind of placing that up
in to the crease so for the lid color
I'm gonna be taking this shimmery pink
hair and to diffuse it into the crease
color so I'm gonna be placing this kind
of slightly darker shimmery color like
in between the crease and the lid colors
did that make sense so just taking that
first light pink shade I kind of like to
use dragging motions so I can really get
the most out of the eye shadow because
sometimes if you just kind of Pat it on
these kind of slightly more foiled
shadows that the pigment doesn't show up
as well as it could so just driving it
allows you to wanna create more of like
a shape and to just kind of get the most
out of that color I thought this was
such a pretty pink
it's not too pink it really just kind of
complements the mo tones going on in the
crease and so many of you guys asked for
like a pink Cherie look so I thought
this is such a good palette to use as it
offers so many of those colors but like
I said I'm just taking that slightly
darker pink shade and you'll see I'm
just gonna be placing it right in
between the crease colors and then the
lighter lid color that we just placed
down it's just going to create smoother
going across like so I'm now just gonna
take a small fluffy brush and one of the
initial transition colors that we were
using so more often like a brown shade
and just run that along my lower lash
line just to kind of add just to kind of
connect everything all together and I
think having that shadow underneath your
eye makes such a difference in terms of
making your eye color pop specially if
it's an undertone that complements your
eye color so I've gone for a slightly
warmer Brown so as orange is really
bring out blue eyes so you have more
green eyes go for more like a movie warm
kind of color like more like a berry
Brown but like on the lighter scale and
if you've got brown eyes I feel like
either of these will complement that and
then just using a little precise pencil
brush is one of my favorites it's ones
away that it's a luxe petite pencil the
240 I'm just taking the white gold shade
from the palette and just using that to
highlight my inner corner but I'm now
gonna just take a angled brush like this
this one is one of their like bougie
ones from morphe and I'm just gonna be
mixing it these to a matte dark brown
shades here I'm just kind of tapping at
my brush into them tapping off the
excess and then just kind of lining kind
of that I don't want to take it all the
way across but I'm just kind of starting
from about halfway across the lid you
can use patting motions to kind of get
the most pigment from there and then
just using the the angle of the brush
just kind of tipping it inwards like
that creating a small
line like that and then connecting it
back in literally like that super easy
and I feel like it's so soft but
effective in terms of pictures just
because it adds a little sign-sign to
the corner and like yup so your eyes
aren't like completely lost so that is
the eye makeup complete
super easy I'm now just gonna go ahead
and apply mascara and lashes so for
mascara I'm taking the L'Oreal paradise
in the sky which I have been loving at
the moment as you can see this is what
the makeup looks like with just mascara
on but I feel like for pictures and just
like because it's me and I love lashes
I nearly wearing eyelashes and these
ones are from allure I've been loving
their most-wanted range they're like
faux mink looking lashes and they're
just so fluttery and so natural and
these ones are in the style gimme a
gimme as you can see they look like this
super fluttery and wispy but not too
much I don't feel I'm going to cut them
down to size and apply them and then I'm
going to show you the finished eyes so
these are the eyes complete with the
lashes as you can see you can still see
everything that is going on on top the
lash band of these is so flexible and so
comfortable if you're not comfortable
wearing eyelashes or just struggle to
apply them definitely try this range
because they're like the appearance of
faux mink lashes and a lot of those
lashes have a really really thick lash
band these are completely clear they're
so pretty
and fluttery and I think they complement
this eye looks so nice E but now let's
move on to the lips so I'm gonna stick
with the kind of pretty pink theme and
I'm going to be taking the buxom a plump
line in the color in a Cognito now this
is just kind of like a giant pencil I'm
gonna be lying my lips are there I'm
filling my lips in it because we're
going to be going in with a gloss on the
top I'm just gonna go ahead and do that
now I love them I feel like they're so
easy to apply and line my lips with it
and also fill in my lips of it it's just
great but I'm just gonna reapply the
highlight to all my Cupid's bow and then
finally I'm just going to go in with a
gloss this is one of my favorite glosses
all time so L'Oreal is their infallible
cream gloss this is in the color 103 I
feel like it's out I tried to find it
and I literally couldn't but I've left a
link to one down below that looks so
similar and I think I'm gonna get it to
when I'm next in Superdrug or boots I'm
gonna pick up the shade that I've left
down below because it looks like it's
got kind of gold reflux in it and might
actually look better than this one but I
just love the application of these and I
feel like it's just gonna tie in with
the eyes really nicely you definitely
could have left the matte if that's what
you prefer but I did kind of pick two
products I thought would be super easy
to continuously reapply if it needed be
but I'll zoom you out and show you the
finished makeup and then we can move on
to the hair so this is the finished
makeup look what this is the finished
makeup look I really love the way that
it came out I think it's super pretty
really easy as well but kind of looks
like you put in a lot of effort and I
just love the kind of like perfect skin
the shimmery pink eyes I feel like this
would complement a ton of dress colors
and styles so I really hope you guys
enjoyed it obviously you can switch out
the colors to whatever it suits you and
just kind of take the technique from
this if you would just haver the makeup
then I really hope you guys enjoyed it
bye I'm just gonna do a quick DIY a
pretty pretty but simple hair tutorial
that I think would complement this look
I am gonna be doing it as a voiceover
because I can't Carl and talk all at the
same time so if you want to kind of
learn how to do with the hair part of
this look then please keep watching
keep moving my discours aren't even
there it's in the air like a pleasing
flare

the stormy sea so you meant the world to
