to start off with I'm priming my face
using my Smashbox primer water and
filling in my brows and sculpting them
out using this well-loved Mac concealer
then going onto the eyes I'm prepping my
eyes with the Mac painterly paint-pot
and going in with this shade from makeup
geek I think it's purely naked just on a
Sigma fluffy brush as the end the short
transition shade then using this color
from the money anyway makeup geek
palette and further deepen up the crease
we're only using a few crease colors all
kind of of the same shake so you want to
keep this kind of soft glam peachy look
going on so I'm just using a shade
slightly darker than the one that we
originally use and then going back in
with the original fluffy brush just to
make sure everything is really really
softly blended for the lid shade as I
said keeping it really soft and peach by
I'm taking in the spot light from makeup
geek just on a pretty small flat brush
just so I can get it really precise and
pigmented I'm just taking this all over
the lid over to the kind of out of
quarter then taking frappe from makeup
geek to further deepen it but only
really really softly yeah and just to
further deepen up the crease and keep it
really really soft then I'm taking
normally I'd take a wipe but I didn't
have a neater hand so I'm just taking
some makeup remover and a cotton bud you
could have used tape to do this you
could have done any method that you
wanted I'm just taking some makeup
remover and then I'm highlighting my
inner corner and brow bone using this
really light gold shade from the money
anyway a makeup geek palette I'm
obsessed with this for highlighting at
the moment it's the perfect kind of mix
of pearl and gold then I'm doing
eyeliner and using my Inglot number 77
gel liner just to do a wing you didn't I
was debating whether or not still wing
so you could have just left it and then
I'm trying these lashes from back side
lashes in the style Paris and I'm in
love with them they're super natural and
fit really nicely with the look going on
to the skin I'm using the Maybelline
matte and poreless foundation in the
shade 2 to a I'm just buffing that in I
always use this brush you guys always
ask me it's from BH Cosmetics and it's
just like a kabuki brush from them to
conceal under my eyes I'm using the LA
Pro concealer in the shade creamy beige
and what I love about this one is you
can use the brush as you can see here to
kind of really sharpen up your eyeliner
or your wing
it's a really nice consistency it
reminds me of the mac prolongwear
concealer but a lot more kind of I don't
know like blendable it doesn't crease as
much and it doesn't feel as heavy on the
skin I really really like this one
to set that in place I'm using this new
matte velvet powder from Neve cosmetics
to brighten up under my eye as you can
see it literally makes your skin look
photoshopped it's such a gorgeous
consistency you should definitely go
check out I'm not sure of it
oh yeah I think it might be but it's
amazing for underneath the eyes speaking
of underneath the eyes to finish off the
look I'm at taking this shadow from
makeup geek in the shade brunette which
is kind of like a really dark peach
color and it's got a bit of shimmer to
it this time so I'm using this just
running along my lower lash line with a
pencil brush and buffing out to kind of
complete the look and obviously just
applying mascara to finish it all off
and that is the finished eye look back
onto skin I'm using the Mac Studio care
blend powder in the shade dark as my
bronzer and just applying this in all
the usual places that I worded to warm
up my skin to tie in with the eyes i'm
using this coral spectrum blush palette
from zoeva and using the brush the brush
the village a that I showed you and just
applying that softly to my cheek like I
said just to tie in with the eye look
and add a peachy flow to my skin then
taking this elite solstice color and
this peachy highlighter color and
applying that to the tops of my
cheekbones and my Cupid's bow and just
the end of my nose
moving on to the lips I am at taking
this Rimmel lip pencil in the shade
tiramisu and just using that to outline
my lips it's kind of like a peachy Brown
nude color as I'm going in with quite a
bright lip color this is the sleek lip
VIP in the shade reserved as you can see
super peachy to the paint so I did go
back over with the pencil to kind of
turn it down slightly and I lightened it
with this Sigma lip vex in the shade
slip and that is the finished look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
