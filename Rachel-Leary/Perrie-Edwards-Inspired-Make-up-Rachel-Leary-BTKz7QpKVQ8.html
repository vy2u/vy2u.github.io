today I am doing something clearly very
different a lot of you have always
requested in the comments to do a Perrie
Edwards inspired makeup tutorial so I
thought I would take inspiration from
their briefs and I think it was their
fabulous magazine cover
so it's this magazine cover and peri
looks like that I have a close-up
obviously you've seen it from the
thumbnail it is this makeup look so I
thought this would be fun just for like
just to recreate a celebrity inspired
look and also just because with
festivals coming up some people like it
a bit more dramatic recently I just
uploaded like a really glittery girly
one so I thought this one would be a bit
more different a few comments on my
video saying that some of my tutorials
are the same so I wanted to kind of just
up and kind of do what you guys want to
see and then a bit of a twist on it so I
hope you enjoyed this Perrie Edwards
inspired makeup tutorial and let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
