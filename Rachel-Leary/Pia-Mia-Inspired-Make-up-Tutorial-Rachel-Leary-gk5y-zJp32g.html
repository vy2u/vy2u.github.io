today I'm bringing you a peer mirror
inspired makeup tutorial I'm starting
off with my eyebrows already done she
has a slightly fuller brow the method I
used my soap &amp;amp; Glory brow artery in hot
chocolate then I am prepping my skin
with my Mac prep and prime spray and I
don't know if I used too much but it
just wasn't soaking into my skin so I
did end up rubbing it into my skin but
it's just to hydrate my skin in
preparation for my foundation from of
the photo she looked as if she had a
really gorgeous like skin glow so I'm
using my soap &amp;amp; Glory radiance boosting
serum just to give that glow to my skin
underneath my foundation for my
foundation I'm using the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation in the shade
6.5 and I'm buffing it into my skin with
the Real Techniques multi-task brush
please appreciate that my neck is
slightly darker than my face just
because of fake town and I wash my face
and exfoliate my face a lot more than my
neck so I do have to color match but
hopefully you guys can understand that
so I've already prepped my eyes using my
painting paint pot by Mac and I'm just
going to go in and highlight my inner
corner with gesso by Mac as well which
is basically just a matte white
eyeshadow so you can use anything for
this she had a really nice inner corner
highlight but she didn't so much have
the brow bone highlight which I normally
would do so as it's an inspired look I'm
not highlighting my brow bone but to
buff into my crease I am using a mixture
of texture and bamboo by Mac as well
basically just a really light soft brown
shade because she didn't have a huge
amount going on in her eye so we just
want to add a bit of definition and
warmth from the photo you can see she
had an incredibly shimmery shadow on her
lid so I am using this from Australis
which is there gold Gaga I think cream
eyeshadow makeup revolution do one of
you're from the UK in the shade rose
gold which I have as well and it is
as pretty I just decided to use this one
and to up the intensity of the shimmer
I'm adding this pigment from bellapierre
cosmetics in the shade champagne and
just pressing it lightly on the top
lightly deepen the crease i'm using a
swiss chocolate from mac on my sigma e25
brush I will leave a link to where I get
my brushes down below and a discount
code for you guys with Sigma you can see
I'm being really soft and gentle with
the intensity of the shadow and going
back in with an even fluffier brush I
think this Sigma e35 to really buff out
so all shadows are seamlessly blended
then I'm using my black track fluid line
from Mac and this bdellium with bdellium
or deleon tools brush to do my liner
she'd really didn't have a wing and it
was quite thick and not so much messy
but I wasn't being too careful with it
which is why I used a thicker brush and
just to do a simple line across the lid
then I'm going in with my Mac in extreme
dimension eyeshadow I shadow mascara
just to add a bit of volume to my lashes
she had extremely voluminous lashes so
the mascara I'm putting underneath my
lashes it's just as voluminous and I'm
using these ones which are the Vegas Mae
and I'll or collaboration I would leave
the name of the lashes down below but
they just add the kind of drama she kind
of had planned on then I'm using my
Urban Decay weightless skin concealer in
the shade light warm and buffing it out
with this lucky brush I like to use a
small brush to buff up my concealer
recently because it really allows me to
get into all the little places and up
underneath my lash line
to set that in place I am using the
yellow shade from the Kat Von D shade
and light palette I've recently picked
this up and I am in love with it already
I also use the middle brown shade to
contour with as you will soon see but
they are so pigmented and they add just
the amount of just the right amount of
product and it's not too cakey or too
intense color wise I'm using a duo fiber
brush to contour because she didn't have
a strong contour but she did have a bit
of warmth to her cheeks and I was so
excited about this I am highlighting
with the Becca and Jackson Hill
collaboration champagne pop oh my god
guys this is the best highlighter I've
ever had the opportunity to wear it's so
creamy so pigmented and just looks
incredible on the skin I definitely
recommend you getting it if it's still
in stock
now to finish off the eyes from the
picture I'm going off she had a really
warm eyes shadow underneath so I am
mixing texture and rule a by Max
together on just a pencil brush and
buffing it and lightly underneath my eye
look this is she had something in her
waterline so I am going in with the
teddy I called from mat which is
essentially just really dark brown shade
and then using my Mac extended play
gigablack mascara to really define my
lower lashes because she has the most
amazing bottom lashes now on to lips
which is probably the main feature the
caption of the photo said like I really
love brown lip liner okay or something
but I wanted to use a liquid lipstick
and this is vamp by anastasia beverly
hills because it has like right amount
of brown and red to it which is
flattering on my skin tone but chestnut
lip liner from mac is more of a brown if
that's the kind of look you want to go
for and this is the finished look i
really hope you guys like it it's kind
of a full / winter appropriate look or
whatever you want it to be i really like
doing inspired look so let me know if
there's anyone you specifically like me
to recreate below or any other video
suggestions all the information is in
the description bar as always so until
next time guys I'll see you soon thank
you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
