so this was the image that I was using
as my makeup inspiration so as you can
see how brows were quite defined so I'm
using my soap &amp;amp; Glory brow artery and my
L'Oreal brow artist plumper then to prep
my skin I'm using the Mac strobe cream
just to moisturize and hydrate and give
my skin a really nice glow
but my primer I'm using the Smashbox
primer water and just spritzing that all
over my face
for foundation I'm using my Mehran
celebrity Pro something like that
Foundation and just buffing that into my
skin I know it looks really yellow but
it didn't in real life so I'm guessing
I'm gonna get loads of comments about
that one but it was unintentional then
 see that I'm using my la girl
Pro conceal in the stage shade creamy
beige and just placing that under my
eyes above my brows down my nose you
know the usual places and then blending
it with a damp Beauty Blender
and mixing the two darker shades from
this valve at 59 console palette this is
one of Sigma's new permanent brush
collection face architecture brushes it
launches on Monday this Monday I think
and you can use the code rachel sigma to
get 10% off so I've left links down
below for the Sigma website if you
wanted to check out any of their other
brushes but yet these ones come out on
Monday and they are amazing if you guys
are into highlighting and contouring and
stuff like that you don't need to get
your hands on this one then using the
bourgeois bronzing primer just to buff
that out if you guys saw my foundation
routine you saw the technique I used in
this from the photo her skin looked
relatively matte so I'm taking two
shades of the Studio Fix powder from Mac
1 in NC 21 in NC 30 and again another
brush from the new Sigma range this one
is so soft and just blend amazingly
under the eye I'm taking the shade and C
20 under my eye and then NC 34 the rest
of my face
enter that booth then to further warm up
my face and set the cream bronzer in
place just taking this NYC sunny bronzer
then taking this away the Sun power
blush palette and this orange e red
shade just a plan that to the tops of my
cheeks I rarely ever wear blush why I
thought this would really tie in with
her bold lips that she wears to hive up
my cheekbones I'm taking mary-lou
manizer by the balm again on one of
these new Sigma brushes
I can't rave about this brush there
enough it's literally amazing
moving on to the eyes I'm taking this
double-ended chroma Beauty eyeshadow
stick in this pale gold shade just as a
base for the eyeshadow then are taking
this away the cocoa blend palette and
mixing these two together just to create
a really soft initial transition shade
then are taking this pressed pigment
from Odyssey in the shade copper just
pressing this on top of the base that we
put down I'm literally in love with the
formula of these they are so pigmented I
have three I think and this one is my
absolute fave then mixing these two
shades together I'm just further
deepening the crease then taking this
concealer pencil from hard candy in the
shade light pale just placing that in my
waterline then taking that brown shade
again from this away the palette and
just running that on my lower lash line
and then buffing it out with a warm
brown shade on a pencil brush in a
corner highlight looked more gold at the
ends of silvery white so I'm going in
with off to go play pigment from makeup
geek then I'm just applying a light coat
of mascara this is a new mascara from
neve cosmetics and then applying my
lashes from ardell DS in the start any
wispies then onto lips her makeup artist
Patrick Tarr actually said that this was
the exact lipstick that he used but a
dupe for this is the Miley Cyrus Viva
Glam lipstick so if you wanted something
similar there's that one but this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
