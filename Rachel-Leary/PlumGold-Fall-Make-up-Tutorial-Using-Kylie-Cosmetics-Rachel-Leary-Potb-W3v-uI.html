today I filmed another full look for you
and this time I recently picked up a few
bits from Kylie cosmetics and I thought
I would do a look kind of using the
thing so I got I got the copper cream
eyeshadow and the love bite lip kit and
I thought kind of like golds and plums
in that sort of color really really
popular around this time of year so I
kind of created a look around these so I
really hope you guys enjoy it super
super easy as well and I'm literally
obsessive that we've got some white
liner in the wall sign as well kind of
open up our eyes a bit so a bit more
like a light smoky full look type thing
yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed this
lip make sure to give it a thumbs up if
you do and subscribe if you haven't
already and let's go ahead and
so to begin I've been really loving
using that touch of dewy skin at miss to
kind of hydrate my skin and because I'm
a bit lazy I didn't apply moisturizer
this just gives a really a nice hydrated
face before we apply our primer and
foundation and I'm just buffing it the
excess kind of product into my skin
before applying the primer and the
primer we using today is the tarte
smoothing @ primer i've been really
loving this at the moment and again just
buffing that into the skin so it's quite
thick it's just like it says just pretty
smooth out the skin and I find my
foundation applies a lot nicer over the
top speaking of which they were using a
new foundation this is the Too Faced
Born This Way at foundation and I'm just
going ahead and dampening my Beauty
Blender to make sure that we absorb the
excess from this because this is a
medium to full coverage foundation a new
concealer today as well this is the
Becca aqua luminous concealer in the
shade fair and I'm just applying that in
all the places that I want to bring
forward and highlight so you know the
drill underneath your eyes down this
bridge of your nose your chair net
cetera etc and then just using the same
at Beauty Blender to bring that all in
taking my favorite powder this is the
laura mercier translucent setting powder
just using that to bake underneath my
eyes and then just using the XS that's
on the brush over the rest of my skin
just to really smooth out make sure it's
all set in place and make it last all a
day and also any powders we put on top
are going to apply a lot smoother
speaking of which today we are taking it
the peach sing cream at makeup and it is
wait we're not taking the peach some
group I hope you are taking the peaches
and cream at makeup bronzer in the shade
medium it's a dark and just applying
that all over the places I want to warm
up so basically kind of like the frame
of my face and then we're going to
sculpt out our cheekbones again using
the sculpting powder from peach in the
makeup so this is just a lot cooler in
tone we're gonna take a much smaller
brush and just apply the pacers we want
to narrow which for me is my cheekbones
and my nose but blusher I'm taking on my
favorite brushes of all time this is the
makeup geek blusher in romance such a
gorgeous rose gold color and it gives
such a beautiful highlight and shimmer
to the cheeks as well and it's not too
pink so I love it and taking a new
highlighter I'm obsessed with this one
this is from a g-way and it's in the
shade topaz I really want to get the
other one I think is it called citrine
or something but this one's just
slightly more of a bronzey a color but I
still think it's light enough to where
if you're more of a medium to fur color
and yeah I'm really loving it they are
so so so pigmented for brows I'm taking
these three products I always see them
listed down below if you don't catch
them this time and I'm scoping them out
using it Diaz Kevyn Aucoin skin enhancer
in a sexist 0-4 and oh my god I don't do
my own horn I was obsessed with my brows
this day now before we get started I'm
getting apply the glam glow at glossy
lip plumping mask because as we're kind
of using kardi cosmetics and it is not
really like a Carly inspired look but I
was getting Kylie vibes I wanted to make
my lips feel a lot bigger for when I
applied the liquid lipstick so this is
just gonna help prime them but
eyeshadows I'm taking one of makeup
geeks and new full releases this is
earlybird definitely one of my newer
favorite transition shades such a
gorgeous warm orange color and then just
buffing that in using a Mac two to four
then I'm taking another new shadow from
makeup geek this is a sidekick
all of them I've linked down below I'm
taking a Mac two and seven so a slightly
smaller a blending brush just that
placing that into the crease and then
going back in with that bigger fluffy
to make sure everything is blended
seamlessly then I'm taking the cardi
because copper cream eyeshadow sorry
and this applying that all over my lid
technically kind of more like the inner
3/4 of the eye because then we are going
to go in with a gorgeous a foiled
eyeshadow from makeup geek as well this
is their newer ones and it is in the
shade curtaincall like I said a really
gorgeous foiled color this would look
stunning all over the lid if you've got
green eyes definitely worth checking
this one out and then I'm just placing
this with a flat brush on the kind of
outer corner of my eye and making sure
it is a blended in with the copper then
I am mixing a sidekick and I think this
is cabin-fever on a slightly smaller
defined crease brush and just
concentrating this on the very most
outer part of our eye to add that
definition and then obviously once again
going back in with the fluffy brushes
we've been using previously to make sure
it's all blended together then I'm at
taking it the sidekick shade I think
this is on a pencil brush and just
really smoking that out on the lower
lash line and connecting it in to at
this shadow and then going back in with
that flat brush again and picking up
again at that purple foiled shadow just
placing that in the kind of inner lower
part of our lower lash line then I'm
lining my waterline using it the sleek
and make up white noise ooh la la
eyeliner this is definitely one of the
most pigmented white eyeliners that I
own and it's definitely my go-to and
it's from sleek so it's super affordable
as well and then just applying the issue
a highlighter in the inner corner as a
highlight for mascara I'm taking the
Tartar tears of mascara and then going
in with these Miami Lily lashes which
are actually supposedly Kylie Jenner's
favorite lashes and these are the
finished eyes I'm obsessed super quick
and easy and I think they are so so so
pretty and then the final step is
obviously to apply the lip and I'm going
in with a Kylie love bite which i think
is currently out of stock but she always
restocks things and this one was
definitely a really popular one so I'm
sure she'll be be stocking it really
really soon and this is the finished
look I really hope you guys enjoyed it
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
did and subscribe if you haven't already
