makeup tutorial in collaboration with
Babs butyl and YouTube she is absolutely
stunning and has created a more rosy
pinkish look so I'll leave the link to
that video and channel down below so to
start I'm using my Urban Decay setting
spray to hydrate and set my face ready
to put makeup on the top I feel for
promises like a really crucial step
because you want your makeup to last as
long as it can especially if you're
doing your makeup yourself I find using
tape is kind of a foolproof way to
ensure that really sleek cut edge to
your eyeshadow so I'm just placing this
on my eyes to prime my eyes for
eyeshadow I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot this again is going to ensure
the archer is going to last the longest
time and you're going to get the
strongest color payoff for the shadows
and as my initial transition shade I'm
using the shade naked from the Urban
Decay Naked 1 palette i penis's I use
this throughout the video and I'm using
my Sigma e-40 brush as always in order
to get the most buff out seamless
eyeshadow so I'll leave the link to that
down below next I'm taking frappe from
makeup deep whizzers just slightly
warmer Brown and using this on a Delian
tools brush just to further deepen the
crease
so for my prom look I'm doing something
slightly more forms and gold so I'm
using half-baked from Urban Decay just
on the center of my lid then going in
with Dark Horse and the same Urban Decay
palette just on an outer corner of my
lids to feather everything dimension
because I like my eyeshadow to go light
to dark then taking a cocoa bear
eyeshadow from makeup geek I'm using
this again to just further deepen the
crease and blend out the shimmery
shadows that we just placed on the lid
finally further define the socket I'm
using a mic number 26 I shadowed from
Luxy which is just a really nice dark
chocolate brown and this is just going
to add the final bit of depth to the
eyeshadow then to highlight the inner
corner I'm using virgin from urban decay
on the small pencil brush most
satisfying part I'm removing the tape
and then taking some of my Garnier masks
Marcello Marcello water just to clean up
any fallout you can choose any eye
makeup remover to do this now using my
NYC liquid eyeliner you can obviously
skip this step if you find doing
eyeliner yourself really difficult you
can just use maybe a black eyeshadow to
create a winged lip but because I want
to go in with eyelashes I feel like I
need liner I'm just creating a simple
way
then just apply your favorite mascara to
your top lashes ready for eyelashes
keep things looking as natural as we can
on using the ardell demi wispies and I
find this just applies the perfect
amount of drama now on to face I'm just
priming my face using the L'Oreal Lumi
magique
primer Jesus's and just using my luxe a
foundation brush just to buff that into
the skin I find this gives a really
gorgeous glow to the skin which is kind
of the natural healthy look that you
want for prom now this is obviously
optional but I am using two foundations
a lot of you have said you want to see
me using something a bit more
lightweight so I'm using the Mac face
and body foundation in the same shade
see at three just the lightest weight
foundation that I know of it's basically
70% water but it gives a really really
nice buildable coverage if you want that
and it's really nice in pictures as well
so I think this is perfect for prom but
I am going in with my makeup forever
foundation the tiniest bit just on the
sides of my face why I find I have the
most texture just to add to the coverage
but it is other than that a really light
coat of foundation let's say
let ahead and do my brows off camera I
use the soap and glory brow archery in
hot chocolate and set them in place with
the benefit gimme brow then use that
same virgin eyeshadow to highlight under
my brow bone flirt and conceal under my
eyes I'm going in with the LA girl Pro
conceal in the shade natural just
because in photos you don't want that
white car and your eyes so I'm using one
that's got a nice peach undertone in it
with two drastically different from my
actual skin tone so I'm just applying
this in kind of upside down triangles
under my eyes on my forehead and on my
chin and using my morphe g2 brush to
just buff that in so as you can see it
blends really seamlessly and it is you
too kind of dramatic to achieve the most
natural-looking contour I find using
creams to be the most effective and I'd
seen my comments recently a few people
saying that they couldn't find the nyx
concealer in the shade almond and that's
because I've been getting it wrong this
whole time it's in the shade nutmeg and
as you can see it's just a really nice
warm shade and it blends super nicely
into the skin to create a really natural
soft contour
to set all the creams in place I'm using
my Mac Studio Fix powder in the shade MC
20 to set my concealer and also just
brighten up the tiniest bit under my
eyes and then using my NARS all day
luminous powder in the shade BG to set
the rest of my face and I find using a
powder to set the rest of your face is
gonna really ensure the longest wear out
of your foundation
to add some further warmth to my skin
i'm using my mac mineralize skinfinish
in the shade dark not to really contour
but just to kind of pull the look
together so taking this just where I
applied the cream contour and on the
tops of my forehead then to highlight
I'm using my Becca highlighter in the
shade opal this looks absolutely
stunning in pictures and really captures
the light when flash goes off so that's
probably all having a lot during prom
and then I just applied frappe again
under my eyes and applied my math
extended play mascara to finish off the
eye look then for the lips I want to
keep it fairly neutral you can pair this
eye look with literally any lip color
but I wanted to keep it neutral so I'm
using my Mac folks lipliner and our
Anastasia lip gloss in undressed and
that's everything guys I really hope you
like this look if you recreate it don't
forget to tag me on Instagram and make
sure you check out Babs beauty's channel
to see her rose inspired look thanks
guys see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
