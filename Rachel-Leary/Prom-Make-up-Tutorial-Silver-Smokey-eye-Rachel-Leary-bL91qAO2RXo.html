today I am doing the second installment
of my prom makeup licks and as you can
tell by the title it's a lot more cooler
tone than I usually do I normally never
ever wear silver but I know with prom
and stuff a lot of people like silver
dresses or something silver and sparkly
so I wanted to do something little more
out of my comfort zone for you guys
so this is my take on like a quite
dramatic so the cut Chrissy smokey eye I
am in love with this pigment from a
peaches as you'll soon see it's like my
favorite silver I thought if I ever do
wear silver so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial give it a thumbs
up if you do I'm mainly just going to be
doing a tutorial because the skin R is
basically pretty much the same as what I
did in my first prom tutorial and in
that tutorial I'd go through all the
reasons why I'm using and why it's the
best for prom so I will link that down
below or add a little card here now so
you can watch that you want to see the
skin if you want to know where my
necklace and pop and rings are from the
rings are regal rose the necklace is
Marks and Spencers weird I know and I
got it ages ago and this is like a lycra
kind of top is actually a dress but you
can't see from the bottom down from a
pretty little thing and yeah so if you
like the look of this makeup look then
keep watching
firstly I am priming my eyes using the
Urban Decay primer potion I've got a
head and done my brows out already as I
normally do I'll leave all the product
information down below then today I'm
going to be using tape so I'm just
placing that from my lower lash line
towards the tail of my brow as that's
what I find to be kind of like the best
angle for me then taking this palette
from neve cosmetics and this kind of
skintone color i'm using this to kind of
set the primer in place I think I should
eyes blend a lot easier when you set
your primer in place so it doesn't cling
to any of the kind of moisture from the
primer then going in with our initial
transition color this is a really soft
cool brown from the Neve palette again
this palette amazing for kind of cool
tone looks it's filled with them and it
has pretty nice soft brown colors in
that as well cuz I think if you go
straight in with grays it can look quite
harsh so having a soft brown as your
initial transition color I find looks
the most flattering but then I'm going
in with this slightly more darker gray
color and then taking a more defined
crease brush and just building up the
intensity as you can see it creates a
really nice gradient and that's the kind
of look that I want when I'm creating a
smoky eye effect and I'm just going back
in picking up more product if needs be
just building up the intensity as much
as I want to and then going back in with
my Sigma e-40 fluffy brush this is like
key for a smoky eye I find because it
just diffuses everything then I'm mixing
these two colors together the gray that
we just put in the crease and then a
slightly darker grey just because the
darker gray was really quite dark I
didn't want to suddenly jump from a
light color to a dark so when I do that
I always tend to mix the colors together
and I find it creates a lot more of a
softer color and I'm just using my Sigma
e25 brush to place that into the crease
and kind of taking it across the crease
as well to build up that soft cut crease
look that we are going for and then
using kind of buffing motions to diffuse
across the lid and into the socket and
other colors and then once again going
back in with the fluffy brush that we
use to apply the light gray not picking
up any excess product but just using
what's left on the brush to diffuse the
two colors together and create that soft
gradient look then I'm taking my
Maybelline Color tattoo and just going
over my lid space I really like doing
this now before I use pigments just
because I find it gives a real
nice space it really cleans up the lid
and it gives the pigment something to
cling to so it doesn't just go all
glittery and transfer upwards so I'm
just applying that all over the empty
lid space and going in with this
incredible silver pigment from a peaches
makeup in the color Stella you can see
it is so glittery so silver and like so
intense and glam so I'm loving it and
just patting that over the top where we
placed the base then going back in with
my Sigma brush and picking up a little
bit more of that gray color and just
diffusing the two colors together so
diffusing the crease shimmery color in
with the mattes just using kind of I
never know what motion that is kind of
like backwards and forth motions then
taking this black eyeshadow from the
same palette on a really small shader
brush and just placing that really
intensely into the outer third of my eye
and then using the kind of flat side of
the brush to create that cut crease look
you guys don't have to do this you can
just concentrate it all on the outer
third of the eye but I wanted to do
something a little bit different than
the last prom look I did so I thought I
would do kind of more like a soft cut
crease then you guys know this is my
favorite brush for using or like
diffusing out precise colors and this is
the Sigma e30 six I think I'm just
taking the gray color up from the lid
and going over the black and just really
diffusing out that cut crease that we
made really softly and this brush allows
me to get right into my socket then I'm
going back in with a fluffy brush again
and just diffusing the crease and any
harsh line so it looks super soft super
smoky and just really blended together
then I'm going in with this matte white
eyeshadow from the same neva palette and
just highlighting my inner corner and my
a brow bone again this brow bearing
trick works really well if you feel like
you're taking your eyeshadow too high it
acts as almost like an eraser and then
obviously going back in with a fluffy
brush to then I didn't want to do a
liquid liner so I decided to use a
pencil and this is the black pencil from
a makeup geek and I'm just taking that
across my lid you can be quite messy
with this because we are going to
diffuse it out I'm just creating a kind
of
small wing and just dragging it and this
is oh my god this is white tape is so
handy because you can be as messy as you
want you know you're going to get that
perfect straight line but just creating
a little wing not taking it too far
in my inner corner but then it taking
that black small shader brush look the
small shader brush with the black
eyeshadow again and just really
diffusing out that pencil and just
smoking out so it kind of creating like
a smoky wing effect which I asked you
guys on Twitter kind of how you wanted
this makeup look to look and a lot of
you guys said like a smoky wing so this
is my take on it then I am just removing
the tape and going in with mascara and
lashes these lashes at the Vegas style
from backstage lashes and I'm in love
with them they're super kind of like
spiky and glam so have it for this look
I am going to skip skin it just because
I've gone through it before in a
previous tutorial which I'll link down
below so continuing on with the eyes I
am taking their I think it was the
second gray color that we used the
slightly lighter one on a pencil brush
and just running that along my lower
lash line and then taking the small
shader brush and the darker gray and
concentrating that kind of more on the
outer part my lower lash line just to
connect it with the wing and then I'm
just wiping away any fallout and
applying a bottom lash mascara and that
is the finished eye look I really really
like a smoky wing these days so I hope
you guys enjoyed onto the lips I'm
taking this nude pink pencil from NYX
all over the lip no lipstick today it's
just all pencil and then this NARS gloss
and I think it was limited edition but
I've linked a similar one down below
just to kind of a complement the eyes I
want to do something a little different
from a nude so I went for a soft pink
and that is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did
let me know at future requests in the
comments below and I will see you the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
