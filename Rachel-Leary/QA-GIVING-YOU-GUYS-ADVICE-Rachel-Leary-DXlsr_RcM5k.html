I've never filmed in my bedroom before
but I thought because this is quite a
relaxed chilled video and it's giving me
answering Viper's questions and giving
you guys an finally thought I would do
it in a more kind of like relaxed
background so get to do it thumbs up
already if you're like enjoying the
background change but yes you can tell
it by the title and my wages sent
today's video is a question also I
haven't the one of these in it so so so
so long and I was a little bit different
I want it to be more me giving you like
advice this is such a stressful time of
year is like exams and all that kind of
stuff going on so I wanted to give you
guys a chance to literally ask me
anything any issues that you're having
or whatever and I try is the best I can
to answer them obviously - because I'm
offering my mice doesn't mean anything
it's like the answer the only way the
only advice I just I've been told about
get a giving advice so I'm here to give
you some advice somewhere so I ask you
guys to it tweet me in your questions so
I'm going to go it through them now some
of them I got quite a few times over so
I just kind of picked the first one
those sort of that kind so to kick
things off Emily Rose says even though
I've tried every single trick and hacks
to keep my makeup on all day it never
does what are your best tips love you
let me - and my best tips would probably
be get primer that is suitable to my
skin if you have kind of oily skin
definitely get more like a smoothing one
or anything that's got like a high
amount of glycerin ten I think it's
glycerin the thing that code is really
tacky
so anything that you put on top that
sticks to it so the Nivea post shave
balm is really good for that then I
would 100% make sure that I'm wearing a
long wearing foundation which probably
would be more of a matte finish
foundation and then I would literally
set everything with the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder finish it off
with a certain spray down like they're
kind of my tips to make your makeup last
I did do a video on that probably in
select a card here or something yeah is
basically to date and I make your makeup
last routine type thing so check that
one out so Ethan says what got you into
makeup and doing YouTube and guessing
that means in terms of if you want to
start one so I got into it because I I
know are you sir collecting magazines
and collect all the little makeup bits
that came with it I've always had a
passion for makeup and just the whole
kind of transformation in the whole
process the whole just make
have to look and feel better I've always
loved that and then at YouTube I don't
know how I used to just get off a lot
question on how I did my makeup and
stuff and I sort of you know I really
enjoy editing like I do I do photography
at school where we used iMovie a lot and
I really loved creating films and I just
thought well if people would like see
how I do it or like asking me how I do
it then they might want to watch how I
do it so just on time creating makeup
tutorials mine used to watch them myself
all the time and it looked like so much
fun and it is and so yeah I'd be just
having a passion behind the whole makeup
artistry and then passion behind filming
and photography and just kind of
capturing art if you will
I just I really like it and it just kind
of put two and two together
Amy says that she made another company
but advice on that losing your virginity
and sex in general a hundred percent
wait we already don't nothing less and
looking back thinking I really regret
who I you slept with first it is quite a
big deal for some people so always make
sure that you're ready for and that is
with someone that you're comfortable
with because there's so much that can go
wrong
that if it was with a complete stranger
that would just be such awful experience
like they don't really know you very
care they're going to embarrass you or
anything like that so yeah 100%
make sure that it's with someone that
you're comfortable with as well advice
and sex in general and just have a good
time
have some fans go crazy and be safe pyro
says is it bad to cut off a friendship
which is draining or pulls you down but
the other person needs you and
struggling and that's a good question I
personally don't think so I think your
life is so important and to look back
and feel like you've wasted a lot on
time and someone or to look back and
think that person was causing such a
negative energy in your life it's so
important to surround yourself with
positive uplifting and supportive people
because otherwise you'll never be able
to grow a thousand you've got small
constantly dragging you down there's a
difference between being there for
someone and then just completely cutting
them off for no reason you can still be
there for someone
in the Kansai point but still be
focusing on yourself but if that
person's really dreaming you maybe if
you haven't speaks them about it and
just say ask them like what it is that's
wrong why are they feeling like this
anymore and just kind of give them the
advice for them to fill it out
themselves they can't depend on you
forever and that's not fair to them to
like expect you to do that so I would
100% say it's not bad to cut off a
friendship is it straight like if it's
having a negative impact in your life
because that's not fair and they're
affecting your life because of their
issues
that's not fair that is it depending on
how serious it is that they really
really need you like they said just
maybe just be there for them in a way
that allows them to support themselves
or just allow them to exchange two
minutes bent tooth one time give them
the advice and it's up to them to kind
of improve themselves they can't rely on
you Georgia says what are you doing all
your friends are having fun but the some
reason you can't go and you feel left
out love you Lenny - and you can't
always attend everything in life of the
other things to do with everyone but if
you're feeling left out
then just if you can't go you can't go
that's not your fault they should be
able to understand that invite you to
the next thing and if they stop inviting
me to things you might have to realize
if it's you that's constantly saying
that you can't go you can't go you can't
go you need to put in the time to say
when you are free if you do want to see
them because they don't like people
it's a shame people do like give up if
you're constantly like no no no no no
there's not your fault you just will
grow apart and that's what it is I mean
if your time is elsewhere
it's elsewhere if you're feeling that
and you if you can't go because I know
you're not being allowed to go or
something and maybe speak to the person
it's not letting you go and just be like
I'm feeling really know about the
situation feel like I'm not seeing my
friends like I'm losing my friend that's
making me feel very low so let me go
type things
it's almost depends on like why you
can't go if you can't go because you're
busy then that you need to focus on
what's important if your friends
described out having fun but you're
actually only doing work work is way
more important fun it you can have fun
whenever you want what the work that
you're doing is obviously taking up all
of your time for something important so
that obviously your main focus maybe
just arrange your time in a way that
would allow you to have time to see your
friends maybe just doing something else
at them Victoria says I always ass up
talking to a guy that I like how can I
get better at talking turn I am actually
quite bad at this I used to be really
just awful talking to anyone and what I
find it is I'm so terrified of like an
awkward silence or it just being awkward
that I actually don't shut up I just
start flapping and rambling and I'll
start talking about anything and some
people think that's good some people
just like what I should get slowed down
but a tech person or game you want this
kind of like think about topics to talk
about before you meet someone so then
you don't run out of conversation and
most of the time it's always like a
paranoia that there is an amazing sort
button and when you meet and you do talk
the conversation honestly just flows
there's always something to talk about
if you breathing when you're going to
struggle just think of like five topics
that you can talk about like their
family their friends or they got up two
at the weekend what are they doing this
weekend and like those kind of like
topics can always let me lead off in two
different directions so hopefully you
can continue talking to be confident
about it Florencia do you think that's
how fair says my skin is normal to oily
I haven't on the product control the oil
do you know any good products with oily
skin I feel like when it comes to skin
care everyone's obsessed with like
anything that's going to be mattifying
and I totally get that when it comes to
makeup but I've choosen skin care I find
with oily skin you want something that's
going to disperse the oils around and
not block them because if you're using
skin care that's kind of kind of blocked
oils they just get trapped and almost
come back worse so I think there was a
primer from Matt called Mac radiance is
it the radiant skin finish or something
radiant supply man something like that
meant the yellow and a pink one and that
one's got some oil control in it I think
that when you're applying as a primary
actually works with the skin but with
the oils in your skin and disperses the
oil was kind of evenly around your face
and yeah so that kind of like works with
your skin type bulb in kind of
preventing it and block
yeah and also I can't stress enough like
loose powders like the laura mercier
translucent one literally like suck up
the oil and i find that they last even
when I'm like sweating I feel like with
the areas I've literally baked with that
powder
don't sweat and don't move so it's kind
of an expensive powder but it is so
worth it trust me kind of said being
single has never been an issue for me I
enjoy being my friends but since my
friends in relationships I'm lost only
god I so get this I've never had a
serious relationship ever like nothing
over a year nothing really over a good
few months like I've just never been
interested in the relationship but I
really don't know why I feel a lot of my
friends have always remained single and
I always hung out with them too so I
totally get where you're coming from but
now they're all getting into
relationships that doesn't necessarily
mean you should either if you're if it's
just company that you're after like that
you were getting from your friend you
don't want a boyfriend maybe take up a
hobby or something occupy your time
although I've seen their boyfriends to
do something else but definitely make
sure that they're still spending time
with you because nothing is worse than
when your friends get to you for their
boyfriends or anything like that
so they need to make sure that they're
not doing that but then you obviously
need to make sure that you're not making
them feel bad for spending time with
that person because they'll see wanting
to be in a relationship and wanting to
do that person so if you're still not
looking for a relationship don't feel
like you have to just because your
friends are just find another way to
like occupy your time whether it's spend
more time with your family or yeah take
up a hobby or something sam says what
advice would you give those struggling
with confidence issues I feel like I'm
only kind of just dealing with my
confidence issues especially with like
when it comes to bored in appearance and
stuff like that but you just need to
think to yourself because for me it will
be like good body issues and I just I
have to think to myself how much do I
want this how much is this upsetting me
how much is this affecting my life and
in it sons are like if I'm thinking
about all the time then for me that's
enough motivation to like do something
about it like it is constantly on my
mind I wanted to do something about it
otherwise it's just going to be like
making me feel worse if you just mean
confidence like in general just that
your personality you find you're quite
shy you don't you know it's talked about
in staffs that
society a problem unless again it's like
affecting your everyday life in the
sense that you feel it units you can't
talk to anyone at school you've not made
any friends and stuff then maybe I know
it's quite hard it's quite hard to tell
someone turn to just like be confident
because if you're not then you're not
but I think you just need to learn to
like to love the little things by
yourself like some people will love the
fact that you're shy and quirky and you
just need to be around the right people
that bring out a more confident side in
you so if you probably need to find
someone that actually won't shut up
talking you think about who you're
hanging out with and finally white
people that bring out a confidence in
you is there are people that will be
able to do that whether it's because
they're making you laugh and you can't
help but laugh or if they're not stop
talking and then that gives you the
chance to kind of talk and conversate
because they've got so much to say it
will bring out a better side in you I
promise and also just learning to love
yourself but just taking action is the
only way to make things better to
constantly just keep pushing it pushing
it down and pretending like it's not a
problem just make it work I don't know
what this person's name is because it's
just a lot of love hearts but what
advice do you have to think on through
our exam 100% just make sure you are
giving yourself a break telling yourself
that you've got to revise for like 6
hours straight and then you can have a
break is ridiculous and personally I
find it's not as effective I say
reviving for an hour makes me tweak
coming back down reviving for another
hour in just like sit back and relax
vying for an hour's in it I feel for me
that was a more effective way make sure
you're also giving yourself plenty of
time how shit is it walking into an exam
being like oh my god I've not a violet
of you and someone's been like oh yeah I
started like six months ago and you're
just like started lovely it's just like
you kept putting it off and as much as
you want to keeping off your scent
yourself so much later for starting
earlier so just make sure you're giving
yourself enough time make sure you're
giving yourself enough rest make sure
you're drinking plenty of water and
eating bananas my dad used to tell me
that they were really good brain food
Lucy's dads and really struggling to
make new friends and reconnect with old
ones any advice to make it easier
love you love you too and making new
friends violent means like a new new
friends is not a long time but I just
find just brand new just brings over no
you're immature group just may be a
compliment or something or randomly
talking about something that looks like
they might be interested in their to
know if they've got put it in a really
nice earrings on maybe be like oh my god
I love your earrings I follow this
Instagram page that does this really
nice story I think you'd really liked it
I just look and then you'll probably get
onto talking marks at me I mean just
compliments or if you need to like no
one can be angry at you for
complimenting them that's just a way to
let someone know that you're interested
and that you want to like talk but in
terms of reconnecting with old ones I
feel like it depends like how why why
they're an old friend you know it was
because they were mean or like you set
out or something then maybe just be like
hey I feel like a lot of times past and
I just wanted to see how you are how
things are and what you are - these days
I think reaching out like no one can
really again be angry at you for
reaching out and if they are they're not
their problem and that's not really a
friend that you want back anyways brooke
says I would love any tips on growing
and on YouTube and Instagram and the
beauty account love you and what is
social of love a love you too personally
right now I feel like growing on
Instagram is a lot easier everything by
Instagram at the moment whether it's
Instagram videos or just like pictures
in general just make sure that you're
using the right hashtags that if you're
using say like an urban decay foundation
and its brand new and you're just kind
of hashed having more hash tagging urban
decay sometimes if you actually go onto
their page they have a specific hashtag
for a specific project so it might be
like you D all night and foundation type
thing and that's what they'll be
tracking but like that product so just
make sure that you're using the right
hash sign so you don't wanna pointin C
hashtag because and you're just wasting
your time and you're like clogging up
your own feed with pointless stuff just
make sure using the right hashtag you're
tagging all right people it almost it's
like investing in the right things as
well brands will be constantly promoting
their newest staff as well as like their
cult favorites but if they just come out
with a new release that's probably what
they're going to be
right now so maybe just making sure
you're using current products and things
that are in trend and just making
yourself stand out that's going to make
a brand repost you I guarantee you your
work doesn't go unnoticed yes you may
not get like yes they may not follow you
yes they may not do anything to show you
that they've seen that picture but they
probably have they're seeing your name
just keep going on to see on Instagram
everyone is about very posting at the
moment so just honestly keep trying to
make sure you're getting the best you
like that you can and it's like the best
picture that you can don't put up
half-hearted work if you're not even
happy with it because then the brand's
probably not going to want every post
that either but in terms of YouTube I
feel like YouTube is so hard at the
moment in the sense that so much is
going wrong like all these issues with
like I've been the hole blocking but
restriction thing like YouTube's just a
weird platform at the moment but just
create videos that you love to do and
maybe again that are relevant that
people are searching for that people
want to see as well as that you want to
do people can tell if you're producing
content that you don't mark I always say
this but you just have to be genuine
throughout and just be different like
there's so many people trying to do the
same thing what is going to make me want
to watch you more than someone else you
only be yourself and do something
different that will make you stand out
and followers likes and views and stuff
will come at their own time in their own
pace and it's so annoying that you can't
tell someone how fast a breeze is going
to be like how long things are going to
take but you just have to keep going and
if you're passionate enough it will get
recognized a woman
someone said advice moving on advice
like I said earlier I haven't had a
long-term relationship so I haven't
really had much to move on from and I'm
actually the worst at meaning on I'm
very like back but I'm quite good at
ignoring feelings which is good and bad
with meaning going again I think you
just have to distract yourself find
something that's going to occupy your
time surround yourself with really
uplifting and supporting people that
understand your situation I want to be
there for you I want to hang out with
you so they're distracting you from this
well and just try and put yourself out
there but only when you're ready don't
force anything and just on see keep
smiling just maybe block
then from stuff that you normally see
the long sleeve you don't see them you
know constantly talking to them and
stuff they will eventually become out of
mind
there goes up sight out of mind type
thing so just make don't be catching on
now and that's what you really want to
do and you want to know what they're
doing that if your razor is about moving
on just lock them not necessary as I got
mean ray but just got the moving on
process and distract yourself or
something else the Lancers are just lit
up with my ex after a year ha how do I
get over them because it's so hard again
I'd like that so soon with them moving
on thing I can imagine is awful when
you're so dependent on someone for such
a long period of time and then suddenly
they're just not there anymore
so again just surrounding yourself with
your friends and your family people
they're going to make you feel better
people that aren't going to leave you or
anything like that and just take up a
new hobby it just blocked them and you
don't need to be constantly reminded
then that's really not going to help
and so just block them out I'm something
new and yeah basically what you said
about the whole moving on think that I
can imagine it's really hard I'm sorry
girl but you're strong independent woman
now Annie says best weight not to convey
yourself to others I'm bad at this and
ends up in shit deprived that one self
has no confidence
haven't we all been that Christ you just
have to remember that you are your own
person you were so unique you weren't
put on this planet to be exactly the
same as someone else that we were all
the same what would be the point you
must have so many amazing unique
qualities for yourself that the people
that you compare yourself to probably
die to have fun if you're meaning like
celebrities and stuff like that there is
so much about them that you don't know -
so to aspire to be like someone that you
don't know it's actually just weird if
you kind of think about it I know maybe
like appearance-wise and stuff but the
things you can do about that like
inspired makeup looks and all that kind
of stuff you don't have to be as drastic
as I change your full-on face to do that
but no I think just learn to accept you
are only ever going to be this person
that you are like what a waste of time
to waste your life just waiting to be
someone else like someone is probably
dying to be you and like to see you
going to be someone has to really like
upset spend your I mean just accept who
you are love who you are make them most
of who you are instead of comparing and
think I want to be that
just think we just be inspired by them
and do only twist and whatever they're
doing just make it personal to you good
at cardio at workouts and any general
tips for weight loss and staying
motivated I feel like I'm in that stage
at the moment I'm trying so hard to like
exercise all the time and eat well I
feel like I have a feel of the place
other than personally I've got told I
did but you know even like never see in
yourself but I think it's because it's a
do it my flat is really hot and my
appetite has just gone so I'm not really
eating as much as I used to
I'm personally I'm living on my own I'm
buying my own food and I'm only really
by my need and if it's not there to eat
then I'm not going to help you ask to go
out and get it so I make sure I'm only
buying healthy stuff which is that shit
my friends they come and they're like
what kind is a massive part of weight
loss so maybe if you're finding if it's
your diet that set me down speak to mom
and dad and just be like look I'm really
going to lose weight and the foods that
you're buying or whatever chef Sosa's
that's not good food so I was learning
like to bro down a few things that I
would like to eat that you could please
buy and like in terms of meals and stuff
I used to do rounds at home I do suggest
awesome unproductive because you get
some rice peanuts and check-in penny
gets and like carrots and hummus and
stuff like just snack that actually are
really young but they're healthy at the
same time so yes diet as a massive part
and drinking of water will help you as
well in terms of cardio and ab exercises
I just kind of look on Google for them
or YouTube there's a really good Fitness
account on YouTube like 15 minute
workouts at home which is so great I
can't remember the name of it but I used
to do them all the time and just finding
a workout that you find my camera just
stopped recording which is annoying but
yeah so in terms of working out just
find something that's fun for you to do
in terms of cardio I like to walk for
five minutes
run or I think run for 10 minutes i
sprint for 30 seconds
walk for minutes or so seconds for a
minute and like trying to do that for 10
minutes and then walk for five minutes
at the end that's just I might even as I
find consistently running for a long
time is what probably off doing it it's
just not fun to me it goes a different
way
doing cardio like swimming especially
with the warmer weather that means
really fun going for a walk going for
running the Sun going on bike rides
there's other things you can do in terms
of cardio and then yeah I just kind of
Google up workouts and just do whatever
I think hope it's doable
