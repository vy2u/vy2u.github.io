today I'm finally filming my 10,000
subscriber giveaway and Q&amp;amp;A video I also
you guys to leave me comments in my past
two videos I think it was and on
Instagram so I'm just gonna go to my
phone and read them I guess so that
further ado let's get started so the
first question I'm gonna read out your
usernames I'm really sorry if I get them
wrong but I'll put a little caption of
them all here and salma udin says do you
have a boyfriend no I don't have a
boyfriend
my friends will tuck will agree with me
when I say I don't know I'm just not
interested and finding a boyfriend at
this moment in time I've kind of come to
a bit where I'm I'm kind of bored of
being single now and I would like one
now but no I do not have a boyfriend has
Ella Mae it says where are you from
slash where do you live I'm not gonna
say specifically where I live because
that'll be a bit weird but I am from the
UK and from a county called sorry which
is just just on the outskirts of London
nikka says could you tell me what you're
wearing on your nails I find it really
super hard I find it hard to find a nude
I really love yours Kate said this is a
nail varnish from Essie called spin at
the bottle and I discovered this through
desi Perkins who I absolutely like
YouTube crashed love her and Chris
Bieber yeah spin the bottle can you do a
video of JD Wilson says can you do a
video on how you do your brows and I can
do you guys want to see that only
recently I've found a method of doing my
eyebrows I actually really enjoy and
find really quick and easy because I
used to really struggle with my eyebrows
like being really
they're okay at the moment but yeah I
can do if that's something you guys
would want to see it let me know in the
comments
Salman Newton again that says what is
your favorite underdog makeup product um
probably like a lip plumping lip gloss
like I have one from door and I
literally used to be obsessed with it
I've put it over the top of everything I
feel like it makes such a difference
like I'm obsessed with making my lips
look like nude and like pouty and I
guess biggest I can without being like a
clown and like a plumping lip gloss I
find it's like the finishing touch if
that's the kind of look that you're
after as well Giselle X says who is your
inspiration so my inspiration if you're
talking about makeup inspiration it
would probably be like crispy or desi
Perkins nikkietutorials people like that
that actually it's flaw like I'm
obsessed with flawless makeup and when I
like think of flawless makeup I think of
them and I take inspiration from their
techniques and like the way that they
they yes like the way that they do it
and just finish and their looks I just
love them boo-bear 15 it says how old
are you I am 18 and anneli secret says
what do you currently do at school or
college I'm currently in my last year of
sixth form or college and I'm in year 13
and I'm so enduring 3a levels I'm doing
art geography and psychology Shawna's
creations says how did you become
successful with your YouTube videos I
wouldn't say that I've become successful
yeah I feel like the amount of like
comments and loves that I've received in
such a short amount of time is like
amazing and I knew literally didn't
expect it at all
I think posting
then content is a massive like boost say
there's like a big event something like
when people do like after inspired
makeup or like a music videos just
happened and you're straight on the ball
to recreate that look because you know
people are going to be searching for it
I feel like that it's a big part good
editing good lighting even though I've
struggle with that in the past being
yourself I feel like that's the main
thing in just posting things people want
to see replying to comments and just
being interactive Neela hos dick host
Hodes if you got that I'm I'm so sorry
um says will there be a skincare routine
because yours is priya perfection oh
thank you um as for skincare I don't
really do anything I take off my eye
makeup in the skin makeup separately I
take my eye makeup off with the Gagne I
makeup remover that's purple and it's
got and it's like really oily I really
like oil-based I makeup removers I feel
like they're so gentle on my eyes and
get everything off I just run out of it
so now I'm using the one that Sephora do
that's blue and it's the waterproof one
and it's ones that like separate in the
thing where there's like a liquid and an
oil that I really like for my eyes then
if my skin I use the Gagne water let's
go like the pink lid that like everyone
raved about but what I do is put it on a
cotton pad and then I put their bio oil
on it cuz I used to suffer from little
spots and like pigmentation on the side
of my ski like cheeks and bio oils
designed to get rid of scars and stuff
like that and it really soothes the skin
so I mix them together when I take off
my makeup and that really worked for me
it took like a couple of weeks me to
notice the difference but I my skin
totally cleared up on the side here and
then in the morning when I do my makeup
I'll use my Mac Studio moisture cream
just to
my skin and then I'll prep my skin with
my Mac natural radiance yellow primer
and that's literally all I do in terms
of skincare it carries Shambo Lane says
where did you get your American products
from love your channel thanks girl I get
my American products never you know
anyone very kind I think from the video
you might be talking about like my
makeup geek and stuff like that I
literally get it from the makeup geek
website shipping is only like 11 pounds
or something like that or like eleven
dollars so even cheaper in pounds or
something like that
so I literally just get it from there I
have like la girl like Pro concealers
and stuff get them from Amazon a lot on
there a lot of American products or on
Amazon so look there mmm
NX x Ephron says do you have any plans
for spring break
so spring break here I'm guessing is
Easter holidays and revision I suppose
I've got my a level exams coming up
revision going to going to the gym
hopefully nights out with my friends and
stuff like that but nothing officially
parent I have actually I had plans to go
up to London for a couple meetings that
will be really exciting and I'll be able
to let you know about soon hey Tara Tara
or says what what's your one must-have
makeup product probably Mac face and
body I'm illegitimate I don't know why
but like I could get away with wearing
Mac face and body without anything else
on my face just because it adds a really
really shit and that of color and I
always find that when you're tanned or
something
you don't really need to wear any other
makeup but you kind of look nice just
the fuckit and face and I feel like I
can just get like a tan face from like
Seaforth and that face and body like
this morning Emma J says who your
favorite bands and artists I really love
I'm like I've really enjoyed listening
to like other people's music tastes did

listening to anything but my personal
favorites are partynextdoor
Drake Diplo with Ali I dunno says which
actor or singer is your makeup
inspiration love you know beautiful girl
makeup inspiration JLo does that count
she's 45 and looks incredible
Lauren peril Peralta says what age did
you start wearing makeup face makeup to
be more specific face makeup probably in
like yeah 9 or something when everyone
was throwing that Maybelline Dream matte
mousse that's probably when I started to
get like the red bits and us on my face
and I really wanted to clear up that as
for like general makeup I remember when
I was really young girl I used to have
this like you know like a really cheap
makeup that I think I probably got this
in like a magazine or something it was
like a stack of lip glosses like 12 like
get to it I used to put it on before I
went to sleep and my mum would come in
and be like how do you put lip goes on a
bit
no quite young I've always liked makeup
only in the past a couple of years have
I wanted to like do as a career and
stuff like in there
Katy Turner says what do you ask for
when you go to the hairdresser or sullen
for your hair like cut style and color I
like the worst person to ask about this
because I never understand what they say
so she'll say to me like oh you're like
a half head of foils now like I think
that's why I normally get like half a
head of foils to like lighten my hair
and then as for cut I just sort of show
her pictures or I'll say like oh like
that's the shortest layer I want and
then just keep going down or like
something like that I don't know
normally I just show her a photo and I'm
like whatever that is do that Elena

start a YouTube channel by the way your

a YouTube channel um I used to get a lot
of questions being like how do you do

stuff like that I just thought if a lot
of people are asking me like how did I
do it if I just do like a video on it or
yeah like use a video to just explain
and then I don't have to keep explaining
myself to other people then maybe people
will find it really helpful and stuff

embarrassing but yeah I've always kind
of liked talking to a camera
