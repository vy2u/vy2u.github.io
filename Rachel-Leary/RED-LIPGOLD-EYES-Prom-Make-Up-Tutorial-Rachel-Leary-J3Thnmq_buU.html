loads of you recently had been
requesting a red lip prom makeup
tutorial so I thought something a bit
different I love a red lip if I have to
go for a bright lip it's always red and
I know red prom dresses are a quite
popular thing loads of people went at my
prom had a red dress or sometimes if you
just wearing a more of a neutral dress
and you want something more of a
statement a red lip or a bright lip is
something really nice to kind of
complete your look so this is the kind
of makeup that I would personally wear
if I was wearing an outfit to prom that
I thought would suit a red lip obviously
it will all kind of depend on your
accessories as well because I've kind of
gone more warm tone just to compliment
my skin in my eyes so I would probably
be wearing gold accessories with this if
you're applying to our silver
accessories switch our ideas with more
cooler tones this is just something I
would wear personally I've also tried to
use products that are going to last a
long time on the skin or see because
it's prom you want your makeup to last
the longest that it's can so we've gone
for a liquid lip and also really minimal
eyeshadows are using this it's super
easy to recreate super easy to do so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did
and let's get started starting
completely bare face we're going to do
our eyes first and use tape because this
is the easiest foolproof way to do
eyeshadow I find I'm just going to stick
it at an angle I always use the tail of
my brow as a guide and that's the kind
of angle that I think suits might I
shape the best and then we're going to
prime my eyes is the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion in Eden and then
we're going to use a powder to set this
in place and this is just going to
mattify the primer and make blending so
so so much easier for ourselves going in
with the violet Voss Pro Holy Grail I
shadow palette and the shade transition
I'm using a fluffy brush in the crease
if you guys don't have this eyeshadow
palette don't panic I always just google
the shades like I've listed them down
below so you guys will be able to know
what they are
I always Google the shades and then just
find something that I have in my
collection that's similar so like I said
the shades are listed below if you don't
have this palette so you can find
something that works for you then taking
are you kitten me on a smaller brush and
just buffing that into the crease to
define it you guys know the drill and
this is literally all we're really doing
in
terms of eyeshadow just because we want
to keep the eyes super minimal if we're
having a bold lip and I'm going back in
with the original fluffy brush to make
sure everything is seamlessly blended
together for the lid I'm taking this
pigment by the balm in no money no honey
it is amazing it's like a really light
champagne color and I'm using fix+
just to dampen it so we don't get any
fallout and the pigmentation of the
product is really intense and literary
and beautiful once we have done that I'm
going back in again with the original
fluffy brush and just cleaning up if
there was any transfer from the pigment
to the lid just so everything is super
clean and looks good and then we're
going to go in with our hoola bronzer by
the balm just because I plan to use this
on my face later so why use another eye
shadow we can just multitask use multi
tiles multi-use products anyway I am
going in with some glitter glue this is
from NYX and I'm just using a synthetic
brush just applying a light coat
basically on top of the pigment or where
you want the glyph to go and the glitter
if you didn't see was Goldy from a
violet force which is so nice I got it
today and I was just a deities I thought
it would look so pretty
you obviously don't have to use it
glitter if you don't want to but I'm
just making sure that the glitter is
evenly spaced over a flat brush and just
packing that on top of the glue just
pressing in and making sure it's not
going to fall off or anything like that
then going in with this light shimmery
shade this is crystal from the same
palette just using that to highlight the
inner corner you can obviously use
whatever you want if you prefer more of
a matte highlight use a matte eyeshadow
just whatever suits you and whatever you
feel comfortable with then I'm going in
with this L'Oreal super slick liner and
this is what I find to be the easiest
method to do liner especially if you
need it to be perfect the first time
using a felt tip pen is a really good
idea and this one is super precise you
can get a really defined line just using
the kind of side of the brush to go
towards the inner corner then it
dragging it across the lid in loads of
little motions not in one big one
because I find they're new
can kind of lose pigman and it doesn't
get the cleanest line that you can so
just loads of little movements across
the lid and then using the tape as a
guide to do the wing however big that
you want then the most satisfying part
removing the tape obviously touch up if
you need to and then just applying any
sort of mascara if you feel like you
might cry my underwear waterproof
mascara especially if you don't plan to
wear lashes with this but because I plan
to my lashes I just did a light coat and
it looks like this without them so I'm
going to use the red cherry five two at
three I love these lashes they're super
natural super wispy obviously the glue
is going to dry clear but this is what
they look like on now on to eyebrows I'm
just using my soap &amp;amp; Glory brow Ettore
in hot chocolate and a gimme brow
through the front now onto skin I'm
going to prime my skin using the it
benefit Porefessional primer then
applying a light dusting or fix+
afterwards just because I love the way
this feels and I find if you spray it
your skin with a fixed plus and then
apply your foundation straightaway the
foundation it blends so much easier and
it just feels a lot nicer on your skin
the foundation I'm using a Mac Pro
Longwear in NC 35 just because like I
said we want to use products that are
going to last a long time on the skin
this one has a medium to full ish
coverage if you build it up in areas
that you need to and it has more of a
satin finish and I'm just gonna use my
Beauty Blender if you saw my last
tutorial to press it into my skin just
to make sure that it is kind of the
finish that it could be so we don't have
too much product on our face and it
absorbs any of the excess
for concealer I'm using again mac
prolongwear in nw20 and just taking a
small pump rubbing it between my fingers
and then dabbing it onto my skin this is
a really good concealer for promit just
because it is oil free and it's got no
SPF in it so you don't get any flashback
in pictures SPF is what gives you a
white flashback so this should hopefully
avoid that for you then I'm taking a
small defined concealer brush and just
using that to sharpen up my eyeshadow so
we don't have to kind of go super close
with it when we're blending it out and
I'm just using my favorite morphe was it
the g5 orgy pore brush and just using
that to buff that into the skin blending
downwards and just yeah buffing it into
the skin to set that all in place I'm
using my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder you probably bought up
this but I swear to God if you don't
have it you need it this is the best
powder ever it makes you look so brushed
so flawless you don't always have to
bake with it as you can see I'm just
pressing into my skin especially on the
side of my nose I finally get really
oily there but I'm just pressing it into
my skin and it just mattifies your skin
doesn't add any coverage or any other
color it just is the perfect powder
especially for prom I think it would
work a treat just to keep your skin
super matte so it's going to make your
skin makeup last the longest time now
we've set our under eyes going back onto
the eyes I'm taking this coal pencil
from Mac this is power surge just a
really soft golden color I thought since
I did white in my last tutorial I would
mix it up and use more of a gold and
then taking this color transition that
we used originally just running that
along the lower lash line to tie the
whole eye look together obviously you
can put whatever you want in your
waterline if you prefer black or nude go
ahead and do it that and I'm then going
back in with that pigment we used on the
lid as well and just placing that on the
inner third of our eye just like I said
to tie everything together so it all
kind of loops if that makes sense
because obviously we've used it on the
top just using it on the bottom as well
going light dark I then applied a bottom
lash mascara and this is what the
finished eyes look like I'm obsessed
they're super minimal super natural and
perfect to
with a red lip back onto the skin I'm
taking this a bourgeois golden bronzing
powder and just dusting that all over my
skin it has a really subtle shimmer to
it so it looks super pretty and super
healthy and I'm also taking it down onto
my neck and body just to make sure I am
looking just as tired as I am on the top
and bottom then I'm a contouring
slightly with the benefit hoola bronzer
that we used earlier and just using the
brush that it comes with just because it
reminds me of the north eater brush and
I think that's a super good brush for
contouring because it blends really
nicely because the bristles are quite
kind of firm but blusher I'm at taking
Milani Luminoso just because it has a
nice subtle up gold running it through
it to tie it in with the eyes and it's a
brilliant nice peachy color so it's not
going to take any time attention away
from the lip like I said about multi
using products I'm going to highlight
and taking a Mac two to four brush this
is my favorite for highlighting at the
moment just picking up some of that
product and dusting it on the tops of my
cheekbones this is such a good
highlighting color you can go quite
heavy-handed with it if you're not
careful to make sure you're tapping off
any of the excess I'm just highlighting
also down the center of my face so my
Cupid's bow down my nose and also
between your brows it looks really
pretty between your brows now onto lip
this is Mac cherry it looks different
because it was a limited edition
packaging but it's still a Mac cherry
lip liner and I'm just using that to
line my lips we are going to be using a
liquid lip but this just helps to stop
it from bleeding and gives you a bit of
an outline so you don't have to use the
liquid lip all the way to the edge in
case you slip and you've got red
lipstick on your face because it is
pretty hard to get off and this is the
map me sleek makeup liquid lipstick in
the shade all red I think I think so
I've smelt it down below and linked it
down below as well so you'll be able to
get it if I've said it wrong anyways and
that is the finished look
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did
and let me know in the comments down
below future videos that you'd like to
see and until next time I will see you
soon bye guys
