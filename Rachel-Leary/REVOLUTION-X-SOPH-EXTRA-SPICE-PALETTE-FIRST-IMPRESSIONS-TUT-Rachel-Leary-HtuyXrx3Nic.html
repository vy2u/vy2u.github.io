today we are kind of doing another
review but it's kind of like I already
know I'm gonna love this palette so it's
basically just a makeup tutorial showing
you the new revolution so if he does
nails collaboration as there's a few
products involved in this one there is
an eyeshadow palette and three nude lip
YZ I just want to say a massive congrats
- so on this one at her first palette
was such a huge success I knew there was
going to be a volume - and she
definitely did not disappoint with this
one I mean just look at it it's
absolutely gorgeous and the packaging as
well on the lipsticks is to die for
everyone that loves a bit of rose gold
amore amore so before we get started on
the look which I have no idea what I'm
gonna do but we'll just go with it it's
close notification that ballots shout
out time thank you guys so much for the
love on my previous video testing
Crayola Beauty I know it was a hot mess
and if you want to see it I'll have
linked it down below as my most recent
video but this week suppose
identification at Bell's shout out goes
to Shania Con that says notifications on
as always lovely Rachel love you so much
thank you guys so much I loved reading
through all your comments they always
make me smile your support does not go
unnoticed I love you all so after I do I
feel like let's crack on with this
gorgeous poet
so before we get started with the actual
tutorial I just want to kind of show you
a little overview of the palette so
she's kind of switched around the
packaging this time it used to be this
matte cream kind of coating all over and
this time she's kind of switched it up
this kind of rose gold metallic was what
the writing used to be so she's just
kind of done it in Reverse which makes
total sense for a volume 2 palette so
these are the colors inside and she has
called this her extra spice palette
because she wanted it to be a little
extra spice in people's makeup which I
feel like she's achieved
I love the brighter colors she's added
some olive tones in there as well and
there's definitely a variety and I feel
like you couldn't definitely create many
different looks with this and there's
something in there for everyone I don't
want my review videos to all be like
exactly the same I want them to be a
little bit different so I'm not gonna do
swatches of every single shadow just
because there are quite a few in there
and plus I have cuticle oil all over my
hands right now so that might affect the
pigmentation of them but I thought I
won't do that as well just because there
are three other products in this
collection at her three nude lipsticks
they are all kind of a lot darker than I
would usually wear but the one called
syrup is really calling to me but I
thought I would show you and swatch
these ones for you so this is the
packaging again corresponds with the
palette and if you open them ah it says
well it hasn't so engraved in it which i
think is such a cute and personal touch
all the nude shades of like a a dusty
kind of rose brown nude nature and this
one is called cake so let's swatch oh my
god so what creamy right off the bat I
am loving this so this one is fudge
which is definitely more of like a
chocolatey brown color again super
creamy oh my god I'll do a close-up
offers I'm just watching them all for
you just now and then this one is syrup
which i think is the lightest of the
moon and what I will wear today so you
can see them there and from and from
left to right it is syrup fudge and cake
I'll just do a little close-up more so
you can see like I said syrup fudge cake
all super pigmented super creamy I'm so
excited
these on me smackers so without further
ado I feel like let's just crack on with
the eyeshadows and create a look I want
to use don't hate me but there are
definitely a lot more warm tones in this
than cool tones and I definitely want to
include that pink in there somewhere I
think it's absolutely gorgeous so I feel
like I'm just going to make my way
through the majority of the matte shades
and we'll just see where we go I'm just
gonna assume you in for this part so to
begin I think I'm gonna take the shade
running late which is this shade right
here and just above theirs into the
crease oh this is like a proper orange
shade which you guys know is one of my
favorite shades to apply on the eye
especially if you have green or blue
eyes is really gonna make them pop and
stand out and the application and
formula of these shadows is always
always always on point that's what I
love her initial eyeshadow palette so
much all the colors in here are so easy
to wear super affordable I know I'm not
gonna have to work hard to blend them
out they blend so easily into the crease
just working that back and forth I love
how this shade is called running late I
love the house she named them all so
personally and I think this is a good
shade like if you're running late work
on you know it's gonna look good so I
like the name for that too
moving on I'm gonna mix the shades sweet
and sour and chocolate orange together
just kind of dipping my brush lightly in
between them both
and using this too you guys know it
further deepen up the crease but it's
not a guy I'm gonna cut my crease out a
little bit not all the way but just the
kind of front part of the lid let's do
some eyeliner today I feel like doing a
wing I'm just gonna buff that in and
again just go back in with my big brush
to diffuse that out together oh pretty I
can tell this is going to be such a
go-to palette for me all the colors and
our eye like I love and I'm obsessed
with definitely right of my street
yeah just popping that into the crease
and bring you onto the lid just like on
the outer part the eye
blending like sorry I'm now gonna take
the star of the show of the pink shade
which is called 21 just my slightly it's
smaller crease brush and pop that right
in the middle and in the socket oh oh my
god so pretty I watched her video kind
of like introducing the palette and like
what inspired her for the colors and
stuff and apparently she's got loads of
requests to kind of have more like
sunset vibes and this pink is like
screaming sunset vibes at me it's so
pretty you can make it as intense as you
want as you can see I've kind of like
diffused it out slightly so it's not so
bright and is a little bit more kind of
wearable for just kind of you're not so
bold look it just kind of adds a subtle
pop of color and a different kind of
tone I just love this shade you can
obviously make that color a lot more
like intense if that's what you want but
I'm kind of liking the subtle no I mean
it's not subtle it's bright pink but I'm
liking the intensity of it and to
further up the crease just that little
bit more I'm gonna take the shade
cheesecake which is that gorgeous warm a
brown color and yet just pop that right
into the sucker just to add a bit more
definition and depth I think I'm gonna
go back in with that shade after I close
out the crease but for now I think that
looks really pretty I love how all these
colors work so well together and blend
so nicely right so I'm gonna go ahead
and just kind of carve out my crease and
I'll be back for the lid shades
okay so I've kind of done like a half
cup crease look and I think God the
color dreams is just screaming at me
which is this gorgeous a bronzy color
here so I'm just gonna take a flat brush
and put that all over the kind of main
main a portion of my lid oh yes we live
for a bronze shimmer let's just pack on
the pigment on these is like so pretty
I'm obsessed and doing the same on the
other eye it was kind of
King on webby put the conceit of pretty
much you guys know how this works on oh
my god it's so pretty these kind of like
sunset tone looks are my fave I feel
like they're everyone's fade they're so
gorgeous
right okay moving on it's the next shade
I'm gonna take the shimmery kind of
pinky purple color called romance I'm
just gonna use that kind of in the
center of my lid just to kind of
transition air into the crease colors of
the same tone I love doing that I think
it makes like a bit more of a natural
kind of blend on the lid if you can see
that and again on this side just using a
flat brush this is my blank canvas
cosmetics brush and the marble set and
just oh pop a day on the crease I'm just
gonna take a kind of smaller to find a
fluffy brush and that's sweet-and-sour
shade and just connect it all up and run
it along my lower lash line like so oh
my god these eyes are like the dream I
love them right that's kind of it for
shadows I think I don't really think I
want to define it anymore or maybe I'll
just take that enchanted color which is
this one right here is like a deep kind
of purple color and just pop that right
above the crease and take it a little
bit down just for a little bit extra
definition because we are gonna be going
in with liquid eyeliner and then that's
just gonna kind of help the crease kind
of look in cut and sharp I think it's
there and tie everything together like
so okay so dye is the finished look for
the shadows there's not really a like
light color to highlight your inner
corner or anything like that in this
palette that is in her other one so I
understand that she might not have
wanted to duplicate shades or anything
like that but what do you guys think I
mean the visually the appearance of that
palette is just stunning anyway and the
shadows and the formula definitely do
not disappoint so now I'm just going to
go ahead and apply
and lashes and then we can be back to do
the lips and I will show you what those
gorgeous gorgeous lipsticks look like so
these are the eyes complete with liner
and lashes you guys know this is such a
me look I think this is such a you guys
look as well I know you guys love these
kind of sunset vibes such a gorgeous
palette that I feel that you can be it's
so diverse where this is just obviously
a look that you guys know that I would
be obsessed over and would love to do so
easy so quick because the formula of
them is just incredible they blend out
amazingly and this palette only 10
pounds by the way guys 10 pounds but
like I said we are now going to move on
to the lips and have all three shades
the shade syrup is definitely more up my
street is the light one of them or I've
already applied a lip liner and for
reference is the Natasha de nonne a lip
liner in l 6 one of my faves like as
just a nude lip liner that goes with
everything so let's go ahead and apply
it so this one is syrup I thought these
were map maybe they're satin but safe to
say oh my god that is such a me nude
such a gorgeous creamy buttery formula
that is so comfortable on the lip and
it's not too too light as well I feel
like oh my god I feel like I might have
just found my next new a favorite nude
combination what do you think mmm so I'm
just gonna go ahead and look everything
in place with some setting spray this is
the revolution my lower lip fix spray ah
this is the finished makeup it so that
was a deal finished look you guys I
really hope you enjoyed this video

soaps collab down below the eye shadows

it's coming to soup drug in the next few
weeks but those prices will still be the
same so you may as well just place a big
fat order the palette is retailing at 10
pounds lipsticks I think maybe four
