going to try and do it into as quick as
I can
do have semifinals to be able to do this
and it is slow hot in hands but today I
have recreated the makeup look sighs in
the new dj khaled Rihanna Bryson Taylor
wild thought song I'm sure you guys will
hide it I'll insert a picture of the
makeup here even I'm sure you can have
seen the compassion in the Sun now
literally does makeup to scream kind of
like vibrant summer makeup to your
intellect bolder colors at this summer
and you're going to sick of like the
pinks and Sampson this is like a cool
alternative anyways
literally loves the makeup she looks
amazing in that video I obviously had to
recreate that you guys know I haven't
sir agent but I love doing inspired lips
on my channel so definitely make sure to
give this video a thumbs up if you want
me to do and more of them again and
definitely make sure to hit the
subscribe button if you liked the look
of this video also another side note if
you see my hair kind of blowing
throughout this video is because my fans
know in the whole time I don't think I'm
not extra in like whatever the before I
was listening to music throughout so
maybe I just arrived in the music for
you know yet that's why that's going on
but anyways without further ado let's
get on with the tutorial
so for this tutorial we are going to
start with our skin and furs and I'm
really going to focus on like hydrating
prepping my skin because obviously
Rihanna has the most glowy of flawless
skin
ever I'm definitely applying at my
attach at beauty oil all over my face
and massage into my skin then I'm going
to take via Charlotte Tilbury magic
cream I hadn't use it before so I wasn't
sure how much to apply so it literally
made my v skin feel so so soft so that
was kind of the aim at goal I was going
for and then for primer I am at taking
this new primer from Stila I don't know
if it's out yet that is part of their
one-step prime range and it has a lot of
like hydration and moisture to it so I
was obsessed with this one and then it's
a foundation I'm going to be using an
old favorite this is be Jojo armani
luminous silk and just take a couple of
pumps on the back of my hand and then
use a beauty blender to blend that in I
know this appears a lot dogs in my face
but it was to match the tan on my body
so that's the kind of aim gold that we
were going for and then free concealer
using another old favourite this is the
Maybelline age rewind concealer in the
shade light I love the coverage and the
kind of like feel of this one it feels
super moisturizing and super lightweight
but like I said it has a really a full
coverage so before we blend obviously
going to have a little bit of a dance
but then I'm it just using a example UT
blender to send this all in and I also
take it up on it to my eyelids as well
just because you guys know I like to use
my concealer as my primer as well
sometimes thought cream at contour we
going to take an older favor again this
is the la a pro a girl wait they pro
conceal concealer in the shade thorn
because the coloring on her skin where
she's like this warming up her skin was
very kind of like orange base so a lot
of the products we're going to use have
quite an orange and warm undertone to
them and this one up all the cream
colors like cream quantifies quite kind
of the warmest one and these blend so
easy as well so I literally love these
I'm going to go ahead and set everything
in place with powder and I'm going to
leave the baked underneath my eyes just
because I feel like some of the shadows
have a little bit of Fallout because
they're super super pigmented so I just
want to be able to catch them and dust
them away and then I'm just going to be
baking underneath my contour and then it
using the remnants of what's on the
brush is to set everything else in place
because I don't want to be looking at to
map I don't want anything to kind of be
moving around off of my face if you know
what I mean so once we've got the bay
corner we can do our eyebrows and I'm
just going to be using at my favorite
products and I ever listed them down up
below for the eyes we're going to be
using the Jaclyn hill palette again and
mixing it these two shades together as
our initial transition color literally
when I saw the music video and then I
saw this palette I was like oh my god
it's almost as if they found it you know
because that teal color that we're going
to be using in a minute is literally a
bang on so I'm just going to be busing
that back and forth into the crease and
we're going to be creating kind of like
a blown out winged shape so you'll see
by where I'm placing it this peel color
I'm also placing partly on it to the lid
so we can get some of that color showing
but then kind of creating that winged
out triangular effect like so just with
the product placement using that brush
then I always like to go back in with my
initial fluffy brush just to make sure
that it's all blended and there's no
harsh lines and sometimes I'll pick up a
little bit more of that color but
sometimes and most of the time I'll just
use whatever is left on at the brush
then that's the lid color oh my god yes
literally using it the teal shade from
the palette I think this might be one of
the most pigmented foiled shadows and it
is such a gorgeous color literally
placing that all over the lid in the
inner corner and on the inner part of
the lower lash line and then going back
in with the map to your color I'm going
to be taking that back onto the lid to
blend it all together and also blowing
out and running it along my lower lash
line just to connect everything together
and create that yes blown out wind shake
that Rihanna had going on then it taking
this kind of matte it would almost like
a dark dark dark greeny black so still
ties in with the teal color scheme that
we have going on and just on a small
fluffy brush I'm just going to be
butting that on the outer most part of
the eye just to create a it smokes out
effect and then taking this a prismatic
shadow from NYX I think it's in the
shade glass slipper and just placing it
on like the highest point of my eye if
that makes sense just kind of like in
the center of my eyeball just to create
some dimension and then also on at my
inner corner and then at taking this
dark color and just pressing that
against my lash line just so our lashes
have something to hide behind and also
to create more of like a smoky effect
then I'm pointing at this one but I
actually took the it shimmery one so I
don't know why I pointed it that one she
had a really bright brow bone highlight
so I'm just gonna be applying that there
and then also again on my inner corner
just to bring it that
forward then just going to be applying
mascara this is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara now you could just
leave it there but I feel like Rihanna
was probably wearing some sort of false
eyelash and the ones that I picked were
really fluttery but first I'm going to
take this Marc Jacobs high liner in
Odyssey I think just to add to the tail
effect and then again these are gorgeous
fluttery lashes so nothing too dramatic
so you can still see the gorgeous appeal
that is going on on the eyes so for the
base I'm taking the NYX know that filter
powder in it golden like I said I was
keeping everything with quite a tauren G
warm undertone so this is it be a
perfect bronzer for that and literally
it's just dusting this everywhere so on
the cheeks down that's the size of my
nose for a little bit of a contour on
that my neck to add a little bit of
warmth you know just getting that glow
going on all over our bodies and for
blusher I am it taking this Milani
blusher in the shade Alyssa mo at the
runs I think so again of an orange your
undertone you could totally it skips the
bronzer and just kept this blusher
either way I still think it looks super
super pretty but you're going to be
careful you don't apply too much so you
don't look like a Oompa Loompa and this
is one of my favorite products to get
that like Rihanna
JLo overall glow this is the Mac
mineralized skinfinish in global go as
global glow and then literally just
dusting that everywhere and then select
our base highlight and taking the
L'Oreal Lumi highlighter in the shade
it's golden and just applying that the
Beauty Blender so are a highlighter or
the powder highlighter has something to
cling to and it's going to like really
pop on our skin it this is a technique
that I love doing if you guys been
watching my previous tutorials know I
love doing this so just blending that in
with a Beauty Blender on the top and
then for the highlighted say I'm going
to take the it Laura Geller fake to
swell in peach glow to something a more
of a pinky up Orange e'er undertone and
yeah that on top of the cream
highlighter I just thought looks
absolutely stunning
so I'm just applying that to my tooth
and then obviously on that my nose and
Cupid's bow on all the usual places and
then finally for the lips I'm taking a
Mac cherry lip liner this is literally
like aid go to read for me or any makeup
artist I feel like it's literally just
make a perfect shade event and goes with
any red liquid lipstick and I'm just
going to be at lining my lips with it
and feathering it in slightly and then
for the liquid lipstick I was so hard to
find at the perfect shade of red because
sometimes in the video I
couldn't tell if it had like an orange
undertone or more of a pinky undertone
it but I decided to go up for the Urban
Decay vice liquid lipstick in the shade
1:4 and that is the makeup look
completed so that was via finished
makeup look and obviously how I created
it I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video definitely show your interaction
with me and your love and support and it
leave me some comments and it sums up
and subscribe if you haven't already
literally I loved doing it this makeup
look and my hair is this is just kind of
my hair naturally air-dried so there's
no tutorial for that unfortunately I
really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and until next time I will see
you soon
