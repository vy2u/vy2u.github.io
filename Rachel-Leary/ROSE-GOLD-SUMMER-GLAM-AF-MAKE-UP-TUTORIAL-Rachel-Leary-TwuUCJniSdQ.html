lovable hey guys welcome back to my
channel so I would start the video with
just kind of my bare face so you can
watch the whole process and it happens
when there's no kind of spoiler besides
to some nail but anyway welcome back to
my channel if you are new then hello
definitely make sure to hit that
subscribe button if you're liking my
multi-tonal body already but today I'm
kind of ways to take it back to like the
old school grounded I feel like that's
what's missing at the moment YouTube is
going much so fast and a hundred miles
an hour and everyone's doing so many
different things I miss the makeup
tutorials that are just like full-blown
at glitter glam identify videos that I
love to watch so yesterday we are kind
of doing a local glam and I said I've go
a bit summer and like rose gold glam
looks and general I feel like looks so
good on everyone on any skin tone and
they're definitely a go-to look for me
in the warmer months I'm not really sure
why I feel like it's just kind of that
whole like golden got a vibe that
everyone loves
yes without me a rambling on let's get
started also going to be using a lot of
kind of like new ish products that you
guys have asked me to try that I pursued
recently so yeah let's see how it goes
so sorry if you can hear kind of like a
little background noise I've got one fan
on because it is way way too hot to be
doing anything without a fan and really
speaking with me and this makeup to last
out the whole video I'm gonna turn it on
so I watch this back I'll see how
annoying is but please do those names so
to begin with I'm going to be a total
Instagram make up the arch and use the
Sistani
a bit society unicorn essence of makeup
kind of well skin a cupid
skin enhancing antioxidant serum so my
skin is feeling it's super drivers I've
been loving using high coils underneath
my makeup and this one is definitely
more of like the serum also smells
absolutely incredible like a vanilla but
yeah I've just been loving the oil at
men but yeah these are the ones that you
see all of the Instagram people being
like well as soon as they like start
they're like Instagram - no shade if
that's you but I'm just saying this is
where you might recognize them from and
it's actually a really good product
don't you think that they're doing it
sort of use like it's actually really
good I love the way that my makeup sits
on top of this like I feel like it gives
a brilliant
bass underneath my like skin makeup and
today we are kind of going to that like
a luminance bronzy Nia look so
everything I'm using has got a radiance
to it
speaking of which for primer I'm going
to take Vietnam a radiant primer and -
I've used and abused and I've been
kidding I love this stuff it's so
hydrating on the skin I'm not even
kidding and it's a really gorgeous glow
and then I love a primer where you can
feel a slight tap to it like afterwards
because then I know that my makeup is
really going to cling to it and
hopefully lasts all day and I always
like to apply my skincare with a brush
and you guys know I always use the Real
Techniques multi-task face brush to do
so before foundation today I did want
kind of a fuller coverage but I'm going
to be mixing at these two shades of the
NYX
total control drop foundation you barely
need any of this and the two shape I'm
mixing together are caramel and true
beige as you can see my body is a lot
darker than my face so my foundation
will need to be slightly darker for me
to be able to match that for eidetic
like betrayal easier so what I like to
do is just to drop that one and then and
that's true beige and then quite a big
drop in the middle of caramel and then
take my Beauty Blender and it just kind
of mix it all together all nothing and
it out we are doing our four part of our
skin search because I want this to be
like a rounded and blown out kind of
look just because one that is like my
favorite look to do as I'm sure you guys
are aware but also I like it's like the
easier lips to do and I did kind of want
to keep this like easy to show you that
you can get proper glam without putting
too much effort any of you I mean and
just when it's like the hotter months I
really can't be often beside ours now
and now on end kind of effective way not
anything like that if you guys saw my
most recent video come oh my god I'll
just rip my hip out
I thought remember I actually said it or
I just like thought about saying it but
I really just don't like wind I
me anymore I don't know what it is just
I feel like other makeup suits me better
especially more like a blown-out look I
think it's just quicker for me is it for
me and actually just looks better so
that's kind of why I've done it all the
time they are just going to take the
both earrings don't like doing this I
don't look totally whacker
moving on to concealer I'm going to take
the in it and fab concealer in the shade
at 0-5 now most of you have been asking
me to like try the nitin 5 makeup and i
swatched it on my hand and it looks like
such a full coverage and the kind of
packaging of it as well as the
consistency really reminds me of the is
it the LA girl like Pro conceal and I
really love that concealer so I thought
I would give this one a go and I did
kind of want like a brighter under eye
so I'm going for quite a lighter shade
I'd like to sit up on the sides of my
nose to kind of give myself the
appearance of a thinner nose just in
like for the usual place then Angela
takes the same at Beauty Blender and and
that out I think it's not God this might
be quite bright I always like I said
take up onto my eyes and I just get them
a little bit a prime but now that's a
really like I mean I haven't seen how
it's what it works throughout the day
but I find that some really nice
coverage I think you can get nits and
sad makeups are super dark all suits
over the other I've left a link to it
down below so and I said definitely one
of them I haven't tried their contour
kit well I really liked that I just
haven't tried any of their cream
products you know it's so far I'm loving
it now it's all I blended out I'm just
going to go ahead and apply the Rimmel a
duo at quantal stick in the shade dark
as my cream at point or now these look
kind of really similar to me to like Kim
Kardashian ones that she's just pull out
and I really wanted to buy the Kim ones
when she restocked and do like a video
comparing me being like you really need
to buy the Kim ones because like these
ones it's just as good as freaking loved
it if you bri stops again i 100% do that
you guys want to to give a view of some
if you're kind of interested in that
video because there's been so much hype
about them but why are paper all about
tax and shipping and stuff that you
could just get it from them on enemies
so I'm just going to apply this to all
the places I kind of want to warm up and
I contour slightly and now I'm just
going to take a duo fiber brush actually
first one just can take a little bit
six-plus and spray that all over my face
and just let it dry for a little bit I
find that way it kind of helps me blend
everything in actually a lot of people
ask how I makeup stays on and doesn't
create a nice looks really I don't know
I don't want to do my own makeup but my
skin make it just looks really yeah not
like crease or anything I do think it's
because I I spray my favorite stick
stuff but every step of the way
yeah I'm just gonna blend this in I just
love a cream like contour or bronze and
it looks so natural just call that the
Johanna alright now I'm going to set my
under eyes and I could define my contour
with powder this is obviously a Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder my
ride-or-die and this mass of the right
here and this brush by the way is the
Sigma spotlight duster if you're just
putting this on all the places that I
just applied with concealer and then it
just under it and means that my contour
there and then with the remainder what's
in the brush I always just kind of
adjust that on my forehead to make sure
that it will certaintly why Alex you're
just going to leave this here because
like I said earlier I want to use
glitter and pigments and stuff and we've
done something you can get a little bit
of fallout so just keeping that there is
one going to brighten up your computer
and set it all in place for a little
while time to when or if any glitter and
scuffles up you can just wondered away
and it's not going to ruin at your skin
makeup so I'm going to go ahead and do
one eye off camera because I'm going to
have a little play around and then I'll
be back and I'll include like my eyebrow
and everything but just all on the side
okay we're back and what I have done I
which is why I meant the old scores glam
day
like my favorite kind of makeup to do
the final makeup like could Lynch and
look at the difference right now anyway
so to show you how I got this to do my
brows I'm going to take the benefit
precisely a Maya brow pencil in the
shade number Tory I'm just going to use
this I'm still at the front of my brow
so it's just like to trace the bottom
and like the arch and then I just like
to map out the tone and then like just
brush through and then just kind of go
with the direction of the way your hair
naturally go just kind of weather it I
do always like to take something just
slightly darker it through the end of my
brow just to add like a bit more
pigmentation and a bit more color until
there is kind of like the grading going
on then I am going to go in with the
benefit gimme brow in the shade one you
guys know I love a slightly lighter brow
gel through my brows so let's go ahead
and set it all in place with that and
then I'm just going to stop that
underneath my eyebrow with the mac
studio finish concealer in the shade NC
at 15 yeah so with brow done I can now
move on to the eye shadows we are going
to be using at the Urban Decay Naked
heat and I'm going to be taking the
shade soft as our initial transition
color now my favorite brush of all the
time is a max two to four I have been
love requests recently for like it must
have brushes video or maybe just like a
like starter pack like makeup brushes
that you need video so again let me know
that also something that you want to see
I can do that for you but I did kind of
do like that half cut crease look I
don't that looks the most effective when
you're quite heavy with your eye shows
have any litter looks carve it away but
I am going back and forth with this eye
shadow and like making sure I put just
as much pigment I like the inner and the
outer corner then I'm going to take this
ready brick color here called he devil
and I'm taking this on a delay but - its
- its 7 it's literally like the map-21 7
or I'm sure there's a more feature of
this as well that kind classic slightly
smaller crease blending for
like everyone that needs one of these I
always go back in and just make sure
that is first German excellent right now
I'm moving on I'm going to take a two
three one which is a Lux petite crease
brush from zoeva as well I'm going to
take a dish shade here which is called a
KN clients just getting a darker and
darker just concentrating this mainly on
the outermost part but I'm mostly going
to be taking it back and forth in the
crease because I still want the color to
be visible when I've cut the crease I've
got to stop doing an Australian accent I
don't know why I keep doing everything
it just sounds better in an Australian
accent don't you think hmm
and then you throw your brush in the
floor for that all I think I'm going to
have to the crease color Vegemite to be
like too too dark so now I'm going to go
ahead and take the same at concealer
that we used to sculpt out our eyebrows
and I'm going to take this this is a Mac
one to a mac 135 brush which is
basically just one of those like orange
heads green products brushes and I'm
going to use this to it cut my crease so
I'm just going to be like flying it
directly onto my lid and then using the
kind of tapered side of it just to cut
my crease I love this technique because
I feel like if you have hooded eyes you
feel very restricted and what makeup you
can do and doing this actually once
allows you to kind of create your own
your own crease and your own lip space
so I'm just going to taking it just over
halfway and then I just like to take my
finger and just kind of just use that an
author like into the crease colors and
for the lid I'm going to take this
gorgeous pigment from peaches and makeup
it isn't ashamed nuts it's more like the
paler rose gold but then I am going to
go on with like my favorite rose gold
glitter on top as you can see and it's
going to be at taking a and max2 or two
which again is one of my favorite
brushes of all time and the kind of
wetness of the concealer is going to add
as like an adhesive in his pigment I'm
literally just going to pack it on if
pigment isn't like meant to be super
light color it's almost like a reflex of
pink but I really kind of like Lee likes
but I want to live to kind of see a more
of a softer rose gold
vibe no I
like to this answers it's going
to be like our base color so when we put
the glitter on top but once we've done
that I'm going to go ahead and take a
little bit about he-double color again
which is the second transition color and
just kind of back and forth on that kind
of 9 so it diffuses together like so and
now I'm going to take a little bit of
nyx glitter view and apply that just on
top of that pigment and then and then
we're going to be using it since due to
some OCC is they glitter in the color
beige up favorite rose gold
glitter of all time I don't really know
why I just said freakin color my like 12
you know so yeah I'm just going to take
a bit of that glitter glue on like a
flat brush just tap it basically all
where that pigment was already and then
on that same max brush I'm just going to
press that on I just love again Stella
and this is actually it's a lot chunky
glitter than I usually aware but it's
actually really comfortable so as you
can see like this is why we kept the
power there cuz I'm going to be able to
wipe that away but now I'm just going to
highlight my inner corner with the shade
out I'm just going to wipe away all of
that glitter underneath my eye I'm going
to go ahead and line my waterline would
be a Marc Jacobs eyeliner in the shade
Orange Crush and it's actually a really
gorgeous bronzy rose gold color so I
really like this one and then it kind of
just diffuse that out on my lower lash
line I'm going to take the shade of
source which was the original color that
we use just add something like soft
under underneath I actually just going
to take a little bit more of that
OTC glitter and the glitter glue apply
it just slides on the innermost part of
my lower lash line and then take a
little bit of that glitter and just
press that on there as well now I'm just
going to go ahead and apply mascara and
lashes and some mascara
I'm going to take the maybelline
colossal mascara and lashes I'm taking
these absolutely gorgeous ones from
velour
they are in the style or wisp it real
good and I do have a discount code I'm
pretty sure I have it linked down below
if you guys want to get your
they're completely rebranded themselves
and I'm obsessive you sort of wispier
design I'll open it up and show you a
bit better but I'm so excited to put
these on yeah I'm going to go ahead and
just apply mascara to this eye on both
of those of these lashes and then I'll
be back to show you the finished eyes so
these are the eyes with the mascara and
the lashes on I going to give lashes
after like most perfect time like
everyday with the just the right amount
of like drama the eye makeup underneath
it's still like easily visible oh girl
I'm living up to this I makeup so and
now let's go ahead and finish off the
face and lips also some finally dust
away that powder heal okay so some
exciting it and newer products for the
face but faster bronzer I'm going to
take Viet Sun up bunny it bronzed up
from tuesday's and just have it mix it
the two shapes together and just apply
that to where we kind of applied the
cream contour just to kind of define a
bit more and add a little bit more like
warmth all over the space and Jim and
thought blusher and also a little bit of
a shimmery bronzer and it taking it the
ánewá to de youtube so not highlight
the palette and I'm going to use the
shade Copacabana as my blusher and then
it use the shade in Malibu it's like a
light kind of alt overall bronze because
you guys you know I love a bronzy like
highlighter so I'm just going to take
that on like a big brush
oh my god all the glow field oh I love
that and yeah now taking the shade at
Copacabana as like my blusher so
everything has like a highlight and then
potentially it's just maybe like a pink
highlighter or I love that oh I just
love it when everything starts coming
together like I can stand is like in
sight and like everything it's just
putting it together but for highlighter
I'm going to take a cream and then a a
powder because I've been loving doing
that at the moment I think it just slips
so intense and so gorgeous and bright in
that sort of kind of where get the most
pigment out my highlighter so I'm going
to take the new aviation liquid go in
below in the shade pink pink peach fifth
or anything that kind of
got the peach vibes going on kind of
rose gold you know I like to take eight
pies damp Beauty Blender and then just
take it on a sponge like this and then
just dab it on you could totally use
your fingers for this if you want the
walls of the product will make it
simpler blendable oh my god how stunning
is that on my face that is actually such
a gorgeous glow I can't go over it and I
don't think a little for a very long
time will now do the same on the other
side
