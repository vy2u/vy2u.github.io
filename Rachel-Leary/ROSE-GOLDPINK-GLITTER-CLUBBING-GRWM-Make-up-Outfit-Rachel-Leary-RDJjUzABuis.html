super fun look today I'm so excited to
do this I recently picked up the outfit
that you have seen in the intro from a
pretty little thing it's not sponsored
by pretty little thing by the way I'm
just saying that's where I got it from
and I just looked it and thought that is
such a vibe I have this place you in
like loads of different colors already I
love wearing it when I go out it makes
me feel so confident and so just like
carefree cuz these tassels they had a
lap so I thought why not do like a
really fun summer kind of glittery glam
makeup look but back in the day that we
used to do and just kind of do a kind of
clubbing
night out I'd be the vibe get ready with
me time video so I really hope you guys
love it
I'm literally in at love of the look
obviously you compare it with a nude lip
if it was me I probably would if it was
on a more regular basis but when you're
in holidaying colors are like there's no
boundaries so I wanted to pair it with
like a matching lip I really hope you
guys love it as much as I do if you love
the look already please please please
give it a thumbs up hit that subscribe
button for more videos and the
notifications bell while you're there
let me know in the comment section down
below when you've done that because you
can be in a chance for a shower though
this week's post notification violets
shout-out goes to its Sophie Jane that
says notification Bell has been on from
day one
your confidence inspires me so much
thank you it's so much Sophie that
honestly means so much to me this is
really that kind of confidence video as
well because this outfit makes me feel
confident this makeup makes me feel like
a badass bitch so if you're into this
kind of makeup and outfit make sure to
give it a thumbs up like I said and
please keep watching to find out how we
do it where it's all from but it is all
linked down below
okay so let's go ahead and get started
so to begin I'm gonna pry my skin at
using the next total control drop primer
I've not used this in a hat so I
actually really like this it really
reminds me of the YSL all ours primary I
think I did a video once of like
drugstore dupes for high-end products to
test the difference I literally could
not tell the difference with this it
really just like smooths out your skin
is a really nice smoothing base but it
has a type of tack to it so that's how
you know it's gonna make your makeup
last a long time it's just exactly what
you want to be going out and go and club
and obviously done that we can move on
to a foundation and I'm gonna be using
the NARS long wet radiant foundation I
literally love this stuff this is it's
so so nice for going out in I thought it
lasts a long time the skin but it's so
comfortable to wear I've literally it
been a reaching for this so much at the
moment I'm gonna use my blank canvas
cosmetics and f for seven brushes lips
you like my favorite foundation brush at
the moment and my foundations obviously
a little bit more toned than my face
just because I have got fake tan I'm all
over my body you can see that it matches
so it's cool but oh my god guys so you
guys know I'm like a massive fan of
cardi B like her music and stuff and on
my explore page videos always come up
and that's kind of what she was
well-known for beforehand so I've got
that app called hey you where you can
watch American shows it's a really good
app by the way I watched all of like the
Housewives on it and all that kind of
stuff and yeah the show that she was on
is called Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop New York oh my
god she used to be a hood girl like
every girl on that show is crazy they're
so they're so like aggressive and like
get into fights all the time I don't
know obviously it's just like a New York
thing you know it's a gangster thing but
it's so like fun to watch and I'm the
as if this show is kind of like aspiring
rappers trying to get their career off
the ground but then like the drama
revolved around it and just kind of how
the industry works and staff which is
like so it's so fun to watch it's just
so different to walk like we're probably
used to and if you wanted to see cardi
be like before she is who she is now
like it's worth it trust me so I'm now
going to just apply concealer which is
the makeup revolution it conceal and
define nc5 because I want a little bit
brighter but we are going to be doing a
winged out i shallow look today but I
feel kind of confident doing winged
eyeliner with like my face done I just
always like to do my face first I don't
know what it is I never do my eyes first
anymore but if you aren't confident
doing a winged look with a full face
already done then like I don't need to
watch this video in Reverse but I'm just
gonna be learning that uh but yeah sorry
the purpose of me say that when watch
that program is I keep having really
like aggressive dreams like because I'm
watching it before I go to bed and then
I dream about all these fights I'm
getting into and like this aggressive
behavior and some time to think maybe I
shouldn't watch it but it's so funny and
there's like seven seasons of it so you
can stop in the beginning I only really
wanted to watch it to see cardi be in it
and I thought she was in it from Season
five so I watched season five but she's
actually in it from season six it was
good to get like the background and
everyone I knew asset Remy Ma risen a
vino de Remy Mara's just like that
that big rapper Mariah Lynn who sings
and once upon a time I was up and I'm a
minute the dead I do I'm Vicki I didn't
realize that was her and they like all
come from that show so I feel like you
know it's it's paving the way now for a
little cream corn so I'm gonna be using
the LA girl Pro conceal in a beautiful
bronze which exactly how I'd like to
look darling beautiful burned burns
thank you guys so much for the job on my
previous haul Phoebe
I thought that just doing like a sit
down chill video would go down like well
you guys I feel like that's how you
relate to me the most is when I'm like
just being myself which is pretty freaky
and I know the way that we all try on
clothes like I just put it on camera so
I'm glad you guys can relate and found
it funny but yeah I got some new clothes
like this new outfit in from a pretty
little thing which you guys will see see
at the end of the video which literally
inspired this whole makeup look I
literally love the outfit because I have
the outfit I know you probably would
have seen in the thumbnails or an
Instagram but I have that play suit in
so many different colors and I get so
many compliments when I wear it just
because I feel like it's really
flattering for one like all the tassels
hide I'm not the pearl of sins and it's
just like fun you can move in it so well
which is kind of why I thought it would
be good for like clubbing or going out
because I love me to bust a move and by
the looks of the comments on my other
video so you guys and again like if
you're going on holiday and stuff if
you're in clubs it's a fun outfit like
this version of the play suit is also
like a really fun color they do sell
that place you in other colors which
I've worn previously but you can style
up kind of the same wave obviously
switch out the colors to make your work
like the shoes or whatever yeah I got it
and I just thought I've got to join to
go on this for you guys because it's so
affordable for one and so fun it's
different and I never really do like
that brighter color makeup looks anymore
my channel so I really really really
anybody wants to do that for you guys oh
yeah I can't wait for the end of the
video when you see it all together I'm
now gonna set everything in place with
the Beauty bakery flower the yellow
powder this is very similar to the skin
which and I just did but it is literally
like my go-to skin Rutina whenever I'm
going out this is just how I like it to
look and this powder has been like a
godsend in the sense that it lasts it
keeps my skin matte by or evening the
yellowness like kind of looks a little
bit more natural than just completely
translucent especially if you're baking
with it I'm not actually baking like
that I'm just gonna actually going to
bake
my contour with it just to sharpen it up
but majority it's just to set and I feel
like the yellow especially if you wear a
bit more like tanned makeup like me just
looks a little more natural and doesn't
get rid of that time defect on your face
it would just make okay so what I've got
this chin strap I'm gonna be at baking
I'm just gonna go ahead and do my
eyebrows off-camera
then we're coming back to finish the
skin because everyone has their eyebrows
differently but for product reference I
am using my anastacio beverly hills
dipbrow in dark brown to fill them in i
have an eyebrow tutorial permanently
linked in my description down below if
you're interested cuz I'm pretty sure
the technique is pretty much the same so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then
let's come back oh what's poppin these
brows okay so I'm just gonna further cut
warm up the face and I'm gonna use my
NYX and no it filter powder in the color
golden this is like my favorite powder
bronzer to use when I just want to add a
little bit of warmth because there is
still want there from the cream contour
I just want to enhance it slightly and
it's a very very similar color
I always bang on about these powders I
literally love them because they blend
into the skin as they're just kind of
meant for the face and they really
remind me of the mac mineralize
skinfinish is and I used love them but
if you ain't got 23 pounds to spend on a
bronzer get this one but again just to
kind of enhance the contour I'm gonna
use my ABH contour kit in a medium to
tan and just mix like two colors
together and just place that towards the
end I'll work it like back towards my
ear down on my nose shimmery bronzer
blush now I'm going to be using it this
blusher from Mac is there extra
dimension of blusher in hushed tone it's
got a gorgeous glow to it like a lot of
their extra dimension blushes are so
nice and this was a little bit more kind
of Pinker than I would usually use but
it is gonna tie it in obviously with the
eye makeup that we do sorry if it feels
like
I'm kind of like rushing through the
skin it's not intentional it's just one
I just did a skin routine and it always
is very similar I just might switch out
the product but - I'm just so excited to
start the eyes so I always leave
everything linked and listing it down
below I'm now gonna add a liquid
something in my a liquid highlighter and
this is a little bit more like a bronzy
then I would usually go for it's the
Mellon emails Hollywood clean body
radiant sin bronze gold I'm gonna apply
it everywhere that are usually word or
whatever it's just a slightly more like
bronzy color I know that looks so dark
but they really don't translate that way
I'm just gonna apply that here for me
I'm gonna put like a lighter loose
powder highlighter on the top and I just
love that under kind of tone of this
it's a very like yeah a golden bronze so
it looks really kind of natural and kind
of blends in with my bronzer a lot more
than a lighter color word but it doesn't
just like sit on my skin and lightly not
gritty dark and I'm just gonna using my
blank canvas cosmetics ether teen brush
to do that and that's this is hike you
can see it is my go to a cream
highlighter brush I use it for
everything I really need to wash my
brushes it has got beyond edge and I got
some excess of my hand so rub that in
mm-hmm the place that we're gonna be
wearing is like high neck so it wasn't
really doesn't really matter what makeup
you're wearing on your chest funny that
I me I'm wearing an outfit that covers
my chest like who is she and then I'm
just gonna be applying a loose powder
highlighter on the top and this is the
cardia cosmetics fiji loose powder
highlighter I have so many favorite
loose powder highlighter so I always
reach for this one and then it's so
annoyed that it's Kylie cosmetics cuz if
this runs out I like I can't be asked to
order again so just pop that on the top
oh honey you best believe we're glowing
tonight obviously just and all the
places you want to bring forward
that's what we talking about so now I'm
just going to use my iconic London
perhaps set glow spray in the glow
Edition just to just to lock it all in
place I'm not gonna go ahead and do a
one I of camera just to play around see
what I'm going to see what's gone wrong
and then it will be back but let's just
get excited because okay I'm gonna play
then I'm coming back and then I'm gonna
show you how to do it how to do it
let's go okay so we are back to doing
the eyes oh my god and I'm going to be
using the Lancome Venus XL palettes
actually the perfect palette for this
and I'm going to be taking gonna be
taking this warm brown shade called
idolized to start off with as our
initial transition color I'm not gonna
be taking it too far out because like I
said this is gonna be a winged outlook
so I always like to start like in the
middle and then blend it and work it
okay so let's stop down with that one
I'm now gonna mix the two shades flora
lightly and triumph lightly just because
I want that kind of pink pop to come
through but it is more like a magenta
shade and like theme that we're going
for so I just thought I would mix them
together to kind of customize the pink
that I want to come through so I'm just
kind of plopping that color down and
then going back in with the first brush
that we use not with any additional
product just to diffuse it all right you
know and I'm gonna further deepen up the
crease with this color here called
Aphrodite which is just kind of like
happily warm brown color just add some
depth because we are gonna be cutting
out the crease I'm still taking it from
inner to outer corner but I'm gonna take
that brush again just to make sure it's
all blended
there's no kind of like lines involved
like sorry now this is one of my
favorite products ever is the stealer
glitter and glow a liquid eye shadow in
rose gold rapture I feel like I used
this kind of recently big just kind of
goes perfectly I'm using it as almost
just like an under base because we are
gonna be popping glitter on the top
they're just just like a really
pigmented glittery rose gold shadow if
you don't want to add glitter you just
want to leave this there that would like
this looks so nice too but I just love
that color so free and glittery I'm just
gonna take my kind of a medium you know
brush that we use earlier and take that
triumph color which is like the magenta
purple color that we mix the pink and
just kind of press that onto the center
to diffuse out where that liquid shadow
kind of connects so it blends and I
always find like going against it works
the best in terms of blending okay you
can either like I said leave it there
but I'm going to be adding a glitter
this looked like it was going to go real
well this is the NYX glitter
it's the face and body glitter in copper
darling so I'm going to be applying some
glitter glue on the top which is just my
Too Faced glitter glue and just kind of
Pat that on top of the Stila shadow the
stiva shadow did have some like attack
to it but i didn't think it was enough
to you know luck in this glitter and
then i'm just gonna press the glitter
just like so I just love these two
together I'm just going back in with my
blending brush just kind of dusting and
it's like excess glitter or weight and
because you set your under eyes you
should just be able to any of the loose
glitter and finally for the crease I am
just gonna take the color but jelly
which is the darkest color in the
palette and just apply it on the outer
most part like so just to kind of tie
everything
all together and then just end it out
I'm just gonna take the white blank
canvas shade from the palette just to
quickly highlight my inner corner and
then take a little bit of the Carly
cosmetics highlighter that we use and
just pop that on the top for a bit more
of like a glow like so and then I'm
going to take the initial color that we
used idolize which is that warm that
light warm Brown transition shade
just run it underneath my eyes just to
connect it all up Sam
ah this is so pretty
and for the waterline one of my favorite
pencils to use this is the L'Oreal
infallible eyeliner in the color super
copper he thinks Oh super Cooper oh I'm
just gonna pop that in the waterline I'm
now gonna go ahead and do a little
winged eyeliner using my favorite
eyeliner ever this is the NYC liquid
eyeliner in black and I'm just gonna do
like just a medium wing if you want that
full-blown naff looking should then go
ahead and do that like so I'm now gonna
have a head and just apply it mascara
and the lashes I'm gonna be using today
are from I loo they look like this they
are the hashtag have to have lashes
obsessed with these it's they're part of
the faux mink kind of more glamorous
range so I'm gonna go ahead and do a
scar and lashes and I'll be back to show
you the eyes okay so this is the
finished eye makeup I am obsessed I love
these colors together it literally makes
my eyes pop and now it's time to do the
lips and also can you believe these
lashes are so nice and they're literally
either like I've inked them down below
from boots like let's get it but now
like I said we are moving on to the lips
obviously you can go for a nude if you
want
I probably usually would in this
situation but I kind of want to bring
out the magenta in the outfit this is a
fun kind of summery holiday I'd be the
word they like get ready with me type
look so I'm gonna be using it the morphe
at liquid lipstick in homecoming to kind
of tie in with the eye makeup and this
really goes with the outfit that we're
wearing so if you see
just a little too much pink then you
ain't gonna be making them boys wink
okay
I love morphine liquid lipstick formulas
they're so easy to apply and I they
don't bleed it's not that kind of
formula so I feel kind of confident
applying it straight to the lip without
a lip liner oh I love this let me just
zoom out and show you the finished
makeup and then it's time for Z at the
so this is the finished makeup look I am
so obsessed with how it all ties
together but obviously is a makeup and
outfit get ready with me so I'm gonna go
ahead and start my outfit and show your
oats or from and then I can show they've
had a whole finished look okay you guys
so this is the outfit it's literally
like a tassel place you like look oh my
god I'm obsessed and I have like strappy
magenta shoes on right now as well I
would normally pair this with just like
a black leather jacket cuz as you can
see I've got like a black leather belt
honest smile Gucci bear you know that
was like the best investment I ever made
it literally it goes with everything but
like I said I have this case you in like
every color I love it I know sometimes
you can't be seen a belt like it he took
it in maybe you can kind of see but I'm
literally obsessed I usually wouldn't
have a bra on you can see it ties up at
the back so I wouldn't usually wear it
but I couldn't be asked to take it off
but as you can see oh my god if you're
going to like I be through this summer
or like any of festivals I feel like
this is like the perfect place you it
like I said they have so many colors
I've got it in black white and gold I
know they've got it in baby blue they've
got it in like an emerald green I'm
literally just like perfect for
shimmying doing whatever you want I'm
just kidding so this is the finished
kind of makeup and outfit together I
really hope you guys love to I've left
everything linked down below for you

vibe obviously if you like the place you
