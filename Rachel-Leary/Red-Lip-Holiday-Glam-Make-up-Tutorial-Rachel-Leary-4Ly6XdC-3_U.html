know it says totally well not totally
but it's a difference out different
lighting I'm just moving around my
filming room at the moment and I'm just
finally to set up so this will have to
do for the time being but today I asked
you guys what you kind of wanted to see
and those of you really like to make up
by posting on Instagram the other day it
was like a red lip look using the new
anastasia beverly hills strawberry
liquid lipstick and it's a really
classic kind of holiday glam type look
so I thought I would film that for you
it's super easy super quick as well I
think and it looks really put together
but you really don't need a lot of
products for this yes if you like look
at this makeup look make sure to give it
a thumbs up and please keep watching so
typically we're going to start off with
the clean face and we're going to use
our anastasia beverly hills dipbrow in
medium brown i'm gonna sculpt out my
eyebrows using my Kevyn Aucoin skin
enhancer in 0-4 I think it is so I'm
just gonna skip through this quite
quickly but I thought I would include it
because I never normally do I'm just
taking my Sigma the eyeliner brush I
think this is and just you can follow
the concept of what I'm doing just kind
of tracing the bottom of my eyebrow and
creating the tail because my eyebrows
are naturally quite short and extending
it and then filling that bit in and then
when I get towards the front of my
eyebrow I just use light brush strokes
and then change the direction to an
upwards motion and then concentrate the
concealer mainly under the arch and drag
it down also to be part of the eye
primer
I'm just going to go ahead and set that
conceal it in place and then use it as a
benefit browser for my brows then taking
this Tartus Pro eyeshadow palette and
taking this light brown shade at the
bottom on a Mac two to four I'm just
using that as my initial transition
color then using this slightly darker
shade called innocent again on a Mac two
and seven this time just blending that
into the crease you guys know the drill
just going from light to dark in up
backwards and forwards motions then this
is my favorite color from the palette I
think it's called a whimsy it's like a
broody burnt orange color so it looks
amazing if you've got light-colored eyes
it really brings out the color and then
once I've used that to deepen up the
crease I'm going back in with that two
to four to make sure everything is
blended together for the lid shade I'm
taking one of the shimmery colors on the
side of the palette and just placing
that all over the lid this palette is so
convenient for traveling it she has so
many mattes so many shimmers you can
create so many different looks with it
and then I'm taking this matte white
eyeshadow to the inner corner and then
the brow bone highlight
finally I'm taking this dark brown shade
here and just using that to further
deepen the crease just concentrating
this mainly on the outer portion of our
eyes and just taking it the tiniest bit
of course onto our lid so everything
blends together
then as you guys know my favorite way to
get that sharp wing is to clean
everything up with a makeup wipe you
could have used tape to start with
initially but I always just prefer to
use a wipe because I'm a messy person
then it put a bit of holiday glitter on
it taking Max reflets
go hold get there in the end and then
using a fix plus to make that adhere to
my eye by just spraying the brush and
then passing it on to my eyelid then I'm
using my favorite liquid liner to create
quite a thick wing and then using these
lashes from blue in the style you
complete me now we can leave the eye to
the moment and go on to the skin I'm
taking Mac strobe cream and then using
this primer from Tarte I think it says
smoothing primer I'm applying it the
strobe cream all over my skin to kind of
give that luminous finish and then I'm
only kind of concentrating the primer
down my t-zone and the center of my face
just because it's one of those smoothing
one so it feels quite heavy and I'm just
going to use that to kind of cover up
any pores and down the center of my face
is usually where I find those
for foundation I'm gonna take max to do
to exclude it in the shade NC 40 to
match my tan I saw lots of Lux using
this the other day and it really
inspired me to use again because it's
actually a really good foundation but it
is really full coverage so like with any
full coverage foundation I like to use
my Beauty Blender after I've used it
with a brush just to make sure that I
kind of absorb any excess and it's not
just sitting on my skin you can see that
I'm it taking this one from Becca it's
that aqua luminous concealer in the
shade fair I think it's think it was one
of their lightest ones it's either fair
or light and I'm just applying this
underneath my eyes and then I like to
take up the sides of my nose and use the
wand to really sharpen up my wing
then you want to go ahead and set
everything in place with powder and then
I'm using this bronzer from Tarte I
think it's their Amazonian clay bronzer
I'm obsessed with this at the moment
because it's literally it's like a cool
tone bronzed herb but there is warmth to
it if that makes sense so it works as a
contour as well and just applying that
to the parameters of my face then for
blush I wanted something with kind of
like an orange --red undertone to it so
I'm taking this up I think it's at one
of their luminous blushes from Becca in
the shade Tiger Lily but I have listed
everything down below as always to
finish off the eyes I am going back in
with that whimsy shade I think and just
running that along my lower lash line
with a smaller pencil brush and then I
kind of lost my inner corner highlight a
little bit so I'm just going back in
with that matte white shade as well just
on a really small brush so I can be a
super precise and then just applying a
mascara and that is the eyes finished
back to skin I'm taking this highlighter
from Shoei in the shade topaz and taking
a Mac to t4 again this is a different
one that we used on art from eyes and
just applying that to the top to my
cheekbones at my nose and keep us about
all the usual places that I like to
highlight and then finally for the lips
I'm taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick in strawberry this is
100% my brand new favorite red and it
conveniently and match the color of my
nails so this is the finished makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed it
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
did and subscribe if you haven't already
I thought this lip is perfect for the
kind of holiday season which is really
fast approaching so I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and I will see you in
the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
