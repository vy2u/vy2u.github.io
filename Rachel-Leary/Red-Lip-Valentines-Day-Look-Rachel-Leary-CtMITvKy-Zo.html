mixing these two tip brows together I am
starting off with my eyebrows already
done then for my skin I am using the Mac
strobe cream and the Smashbox smoothing
primer and the Bourjois healthy mix
foundation all the details of that will
be linked down below including the brush
that I used for my brows because you
guys always ask unto the highlighting
contour I am using the light Anastasia
cream contour kit and these two shades
and using this L'Oreal extraordinary
facial oil because that makes it a lot
more creamier and a lot more easy to use
and I will just blend that into my skin
and again I'll leave the brushes I've
used here as well down below in the
description then taking up my damp
sponge I am just blending those kind of
areas that I just applied into my skin
now just applying the contour shade
again the same sort of blending motion
and I really like this brush to apply it
so I will leave a link to that in the
description down below as well then to
set the concealer I am taking my
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade diffused light because this gives
the most gorgeous finish and it's
perfect for Valentine's Day for that
kind of flawless skin then for my cheeks
I am using this bronzing powder from the
Tanya burr peachy glow palette and in
love of their and just using a fluffy
brush to apply that essentially just
setting the places that we kind of
creamed one toward
and highlight I kind of got carried away
and just put it all over my face
but anyways moving on it to it that I
make up I'm starting with my eyes
practice and that can be painful then
use an annotated self made palette
mixing it to light brown shades together
I think it was on a fluffy brush and
just blending that in secrete using that
windscreen wiper motion and keeping the
shape of the eye kind of more rounded
and weand
it's rounded then on a denser kind of
more precise crease brush I'm taking the
same at Morocco shades just about me
with the peach and kind of using that to
deepen up the socket and then going back
in then the lid shade I am taking a pink
champagne from the same palette and just
pressing that all over my lid I am gonna
be putting glitter on the top so this is
just kind of acting as that base color
then I'm going back in with the same
kind of defined crease brush and just
making sure the lid shade in the crease
shades or nicely blended together the
glitter I'm using is from Coastal Scents
it's from the color ballerina dream and
using my Too Faced glitter glue just
using a synthetic brush to place the
glue onto the lid where I want the
glitter to stick then obviously just
pressing the glitter on top I'm
literally in love with this glitter it's
such a gorgeous reflex to it it's kind
of it looked pink but it kind of has
like blues and reds and stuff like that
running through it so it was kind of
perfect for this look then they're just
dusting away any of the fallout on the
face just because it did pull down
slightly onto my skin and then I'm going
back in with the Morocco and now this
time it mixing it with the fudge shade
I'm using that again it's just make sure
the lid and the crease colors all softly
blend together
and blending it out once more with that
initial fluffy brush on a pencil brush I
am taking the shade Morocco from the
same palette and just using that
underneath my eye to kind of tie
everything together on a different
pencil brush rather I am taking the
highlight shade from the Tanya burr
palette and using that to highlight my
inner corners then I just apply mascara
this is the Revlon super length and
these gorgeous lashes from peaches make
up in the number oh nine and that is the
finished eye look I really really like
the way how it turned out it's kind of
simple but statement and speaking of
statement moving on to the lip I'm using
this matte lipstick from sleek makeup in
the shade Rio rehaul wreck or something
like that and just like I said applying
that all over the lip with lip quit
lipsticks I never feel like you need a
pencil but if you feel like you need a
pencil then go ahead and that is the
finished look I really hope you guys
liked it let me know in the comments
