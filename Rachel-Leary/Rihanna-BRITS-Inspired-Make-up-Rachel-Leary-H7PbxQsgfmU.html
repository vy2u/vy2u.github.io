channel so to start off I'm prepping my
skin with my oily hydration two-in-one
moisturizer and my L'Oreal Lumi magique
primer then for my brows Rihanna has a
bit more of a softer brows I'm using my
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz in
medium brown and she also had a really
highlighted brow bone
so I'm using this NYX wonder pencil in
the shade like to medium I think and
just using that to sculpt out my brow
you can use anything for this like a
concealer or something like that this is
just something I had to hand and I
actually prefer the consistency of it
it's not too creamy then I am it using
it this brush from Sigma I will leave it
linked down below just to blend that in
and make sure that we have no soft lines
and it looks really natural
moving on to skin I'm using my Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation in the
shade 6.5 as you can see my body is a
lot more tanned in my face and so I'm
using a darker foundation to color match
and so it all blends out and looks more
natural
moving on to eyes I'm prepping my eyes
as my Mac painterly paint-pot then going
in with this warm brown shade from the
chocolate bar palette by Too Faced and
then using my Sigma e-40 brush as always
just blending this color into the crease
to add a bit more depth she had quite a
warm crease going on but we're only
going to be using to crease colors
because she didn't have too much
definition in her socket and just using
kind of windscreen wiper motions and
buffing motions to make sure all edges
are really soft then using this blusher
from makeup geek in the color spellbound
on an e25 brush from sigma as well just
using that to further deepen up the
socket she had quite a pinky purple e.i
going on so I thought instead of finding
a pink eyeshadow I'll use blusher that
I'm planning to use on my face to kind
of save product so that's why I did it
there using this foiled eyeshadow from
makeup geek in the shade Wims cool I am
pressing this onto my lid it's almost
like a really really really pale
iridescent violet shade which is really
similar to the one that Brianna had
going on on the bridge she did however
have some molds duochrome like purple
shade going on in her inner corner so
this is the perfect color it's from
makeup seek in the color phantom and I'm
using a flat brush just to kind of press
this in the inner corner and taking it
slightly back up onto my lid on top of
that whimsical I shadow that we just
played down then I'm going back in with
the Sigma e-40 brush with no additional
product and just softening out all the
edges and making sure it's all blended
together nicely
moving on to eyeliner I'm using this
liquid liner from Sigma and obviously
black she had a very thin line going
from inner to outer corner gradually
getting thicker towards the wing so I'm
kind of showing you what I'm doing here
I never really include eyeliner but I
thought this was quite an easy wearable
one so I'll try and include how I do it
here so as you can see going from inner
to outer corner gradually getting
thicker using loads of little strokes
rather than one giant one I feel like
this way you kind of avoid making it as
many mistakes as possible then creating
the base of the wing and then connecting
it back to the kind of lid that we'd the
lid liner that we'd created and then
just knitting up the edges then I'm just
applying mascara this is the one from
benefit and then she had quite natural
lashes so I'm using the ardell demi
wispies to just kind of complete the
look then going on back to the skin I am
using two concealers one is more of a
highlighter I'm using the a quick low
serum one from Stila in the shade medium
and just blending that into my skin this
one kind of matches my skin so it was
kind of more to conceal any dark circles
and I'm using a really small flat brush
to tidy up the liner and then buffing
that in and making sure it's all blended
out and then using the Mac prep and
prime pen in light boost to kind of
brighten up under my eye rather then use
a bright concealer this time you can use
a bright concealer initially obviously
just do whatever you want this may look
like a lot of product but this products
actually very very thin and then as
you'll see I do use a damp brush to
blend outside that absorbs additional
product as well so kind of minimizing
the amount of product on my skin
it didn't look as if she was wearing
much bronzer so I am it lightly bronzing
up my skin with this cream bronzer from
chanel de Soleil to tan one on a duo
fiber brush and just applying that in
the places that I would normally it runs
up my skin then just selling my
highlighter and concealer in place using
the hourglass ambient lighting powder in
diffused light my favorite powder
especially with this foundation I feel
like they're a match made in heaven it
just makes your skin look so flawless
and I love it then I'm using a really
big brush and just kind of setting the
bronzer in place with this light to
medium bronzing powder from peaches
makeup and I'm using just a big brush
like I said because I didn't want to
apply too much and I wanted it to be
really soft then going back in with the
spellbound brush we used in the eyes on
a Sigma blusher brush and yeah just
applying that to the apples of my cheeks
because Rihanna definitely had more
blush than bronzer going on then for
highlighter I am taking this multi fan
brush and using mary-lou manizer by the
balm just to add a glow to my skin in
all the places that I kind of want to
stand out going back to the eyes Rihanna
had quite a dark shadow underneath her
eye so I'm taking this shimmery a
purpley brown shade from the same Too
Faced chocolate bar palette and just
buffing that underneath my lower lash
line on a pencil brush then I just
applied bottom lash mascara and that is
the eyes done
moving on to the lips I'm using this Mac
Pro Longwear pencil in the shade double
time as she had quite a pink lip going
on so I'm using this to line my lips
then taking this lipstick from two-faced
in the color nude beach just applying
that all over my lips and then to finish
it off I am at taking the lip gloss
daydream from a Tanya burr which is a
really light pink shade just to lighten
it slightly as it I feel like it in the
picture the lips are slightly lighter
than that and that is the finished look
