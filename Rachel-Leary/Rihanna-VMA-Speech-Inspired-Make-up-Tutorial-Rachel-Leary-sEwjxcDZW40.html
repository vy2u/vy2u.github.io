my channel so today I did a really
really requested look it was the Rihanna
VMAs kind of dark lip makeup that she
was wearing when she did that speech
with Drake I may or may not have cried
when I watched that yeah I thought this
would be is such a fun makeup to do with
autumn and fall approaching really
quickly it's obviously a really dark
smokey eye which was super easy by the
way I even did my skin first and there
was no fallout with the products I used
as well so hopefully you guys find it
super easy because it's kind of really
grungy and smoky so I didn't want
anything too clean cut which is quite
different for me and obviously a dark
lip as well and I'm using a few new
products so I really hope you guys enjoy
this video give it a thumbs up if you
did and make sure to subscribe if you
haven't already I love doing inspired
looks on my channel and I have another
one coming on Thursday yeah if you want
to know how to get this Rihanna VMAs
speech inspired makeup based or the see
on the pictures that you saw the
thumbnail then please keep watching
even though this is a smoky eye we're
going to be doing our skin first so I'm
going to go ahead and pry my skin using
the Too Faced hangover X primer and then
buffing that into my skin with my Real
Techniques expert face brush like I
always do with primers and we're doing a
skin first because the look is really
kind of grungy and it's not clean-cut or
anything like that and I find that
easiest to achieve when I do my skin
first onto foundation I'm using the
makeup ever Ultra HD stick in the shade
or one 5/3 and just buffing that into my
skin using this Real Techniques buffing
brush she had a really kind of flawless
finish and I love the finish with this
foundation which is why I'm using it and
I couldn't really tell if it was super
matte or dewy and this one is kind of in
between and it's like a satin finish so
that's why I'm using this one but
obviously use whichever one you are most
happy with for concealer I am using the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
20 you definitely want to use a
concealer that is a few shades lighter
than your skin tone finish look she had
a really really highlighted under eye
which is why I'm using this one because
it's super creamy
definitely a drugstore dupe for the NARS
radiant creamy concealer if you've tried
that one you'll know what I mean they're
super similar in consistency and yeah
I'm just placement in all the places
that I want to highlight and then
blending that in it with a damp Beauty
Blender to get that kind of flawless
finish and make sure we don't have too
much product on the skin as Beauty
blenders absorb any excess product and
kind of have will allow you to have
minimal product on the skin but still
look super flawless which is why I love
them to set that in place and also to
bake with I'm using the RTM a powder you
guys know I'm obsessed AddThis I
normally and have done in the past
recommended not to bake with this but
that is only because it makes it super
bright but like I said Rihanna had a
really bright under-eye so this one is
perfect for this and this is also going
to help if there's any fallout with the
dark eye shadows to be able to just
brush them away without leaving any kind
of residue on the skin that's why baking
is so handy because it almost just
creates like a layer on the skin that
just allows for no mistakes so yeah I'm
just baking with it and then brushing
away the excess powder
to contour I'm using a benefit hoola
bronzer and just the brush that it comes
with we are going to be using a bronzer
as well but she had definitely more of a
cool tone defined contour and this
benefit bronzer is perfect for that so
yeah just going ahead and using this
brush it's like a little dupe for the
Nas Itza brush if you've always wanted
to try that this one it comes with it
and I love it the bristles are quite
firm as well and I find that that
actually makes it blend a lot easier so
I'm just kind of applying that in all
the places that I want to reduce and to
contour just like a contour should and
like I said going in with a bronzer this
is the Mac mineralized skinfinish in
medium tan a really really soft golden
color I love this one it's really kind
of subtle so perfect if you've got
fair-skinned I definitely recommend this
as a bronzer because we just applied
that benefit product I didn't want
anything too heavy for blusher she
definitely had a flush of orange going
on so I'm going in with this blusher
from Milani in bellissimo bronze these
are so so so pigmented so definitely be
careful with these I barely touched my
brush on the product and I'm just kind
of dabbing it on it to make sure that we
don't go too heavy with it because
otherwise we're going to look like a
tangerine but it's such a gorgeous color
for highlight I'm going in with an old
favorite this is Becca moonstone because
her highlight was definitely a pale
champagne color I didn't really notice
much too much of it on her cheeks but
definitely on her nose but obviously I
just want to keep things balanced and
even across the skin so I'm just
applying it quite softly to the tops of
my cheekbones and concentrating it
mainly on the kind of center of my face
so on my nose and Cupid's bow
with the skin done on two eyebrows she
definitely had an arch going on and they
were really clean cut so I'm using two
gel products and this is what mine
looked like obviously everyone's
eyebrows different so I always skip
through that part but now on to the eyes
I'm using this matte meet Matt try mini
palette from the balm and I'm mixing
these two colors together for initial
crease it was definitely more of a cool
tone look but there was warmth as kind
of she got what's the word like the
gradient was kind of a warm a toned
color so I'm just mixing those two
together to create a really soft wash
and you can see I'm kind of angling and
placing my brush in more of a winged
shape as in when I'm putting the product
down I'm making sure it goes out into a
wing to further deepen it I'm taking
this shade from the same palette on a
smaller more defined crease brush as you
can see the movement like I said kind of
creating that winged out shape but
nothing too harsh because obviously it's
more of a grungy look and you're just
placing it and building up the color
intensity as much as you like then
obviously going back in with our initial
brush that we use this is just a Mac two
to four just to make sure everything is
softly blended out because we're using
quite dark colors we want to make sure
that it is blended all the way this is
the Too Faced natural eyes palette and
I'm going in with this shade here on
definitely a very more on my golden say
on a more defined crease brush this one
is from a sigma and yet like I said
using that same movement of creating a
winged out shape so being really precise
with my brush movement and placement I
really feel like that past two minutes I
just rambled and I didn't really make a
lot of sense but you guys at get what I
mean and then going back in with the
brush that we used before just to make
sure it's all a burl ended out
seamlessly
for the lid color i mixing that same two
colors that we just use and just packing
that on it to the lid i really couldn't
tell in the picture if it was a matte
finish or a if there was like a bit of
sparkle going on so initially I went in
with Matt and then in that naturalised
to face palette I saw this color and I
thought I'm going to add a little bit of
this so I just pressed that over the top
of the matte colors that we just kind of
put down because it's not too sparkly
and it has a little bit of a gold reflex
and I just thought that was super super
pretty now going in with this dark brown
color from the same at the balm palette
I'm using that to further define the
socket and crease to kind of create that
winged out shape even more and make it a
lot more obvious because we've been
quite subtle with the colored placement
up until now so just making sure that
it's all blended together and yes as you
can see that shape still keeping it
winged and like I said there was a tiny
bit of fallout but because we baked we
can brush it away and it's not going to
leave any marks now going in with black
be super super careful with this I'm
just using a really small brush and
almost using more of packing movement
and then blending to make sure all the
product is on the eye and we get minimal
minimal fallout and taking it up into
the crease but concentrating it more on
the outer part of the eye just to kind
of create that final winged out look and
then it going back in with the fluffy
brushes to make sure it's all blended
and you can use it to kind of drag out
further if you want to yes oh my god how
much can i ramble about blending
eyeshadow you guys get the idea and you
can see what I'm doing just you want to
make sure that everything is blended
super super it seamlessly taking an
angled brush and that same black
eyeshadow we're just going to press that
along our top lash line just so when we
put lashes on they don't look so intense
and kind of out of place this just kind
of gives them a little bit of a base and
then for the lower lash line taking that
gray color and a pencil brush just
really smoking that out this is almost
going to act as the transition color so
it will be the furthest color away that
you see so don't be scared to smoke it
out quite far like downwards because
then we are going in with this dark
brown that we used earlier as well on a
smaller more defined brush and really
packing that on to the lower lash line
and then obviously going back in with
that pencil brush to smoke it and blend
it out
then I'm taking this as a way that
graphic eyes pencil in the shade mute
and running it in my lashline and then I
am at taking lashes either House of
lashes ikonics I think Rihanna was just
wearing mascara but she had really long
lashes so if you can't achieve that with
the distance car like me I went ahead
and applied lashes as always for the lip
I'm taking this Too Faced liquid
lipstick in evil twin I got these today
I'm obsessed with all the colors and the
formula lasts the longest time and she
definitely had a dark vampy lip going on
so I wanted to incorporate that and when
I put this on it definitely looked way
too kind of dark and kind of more blue
toned so I wanted to warm it up a bit
and I'm going in with another Too Faced
liquid lip and this one is in the color
drop dead red I think and I just mix
that over the top to create the perfect
shade and that is the finished makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
