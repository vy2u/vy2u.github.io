a my skin and I so I'm just priming my
skin using this models own primer and
using the l'oreal infallible foundation
and going ahead and priming my eyes
using the Maybelline Color tattoo and
creme de nude you guys know this is my
favorite and I find it to be a really
effective eye base then I'm just using
the morphe 3501 eye and I'm using this
for basically the whole look but I'm
just doing a basic eye look that I
thought would complement the kind of dog
filter so just sticking with really warm
tones so I just went ahead and set my
eye base in place with the kind of
lightest pale shade and then going in
with a really warm brown and a fluffy
brush were just literally gonna create
the most minimal smoky eye just to
complement the look so you can literally
do whatever you want for this and then
I'm going in with a slightly darker warm
brown you guys made the drill just to
further deepen up the crease and create
some depth in the soccer then going
obviously back in with our original
fluffy brush to blend everything out and
then finally going in with this slightly
darker brown shade I'm not necessarily
creating a cut crease but I am kind of
using that motion just to that was just
the kind of look that I wanted to go for
but then going back in with all the
brushes again to blend everything out
and make sure it's all blended together
and we've got that nice gradient going
on and going in with that white shade
again that we use to set the eye in
place just using that as our lid shade
and to clean up the kind of crease area
then I'm just creating a winged liner
using might artist liquid liner like so
and then going ahead and applying
mascara and lashes so this is the kind
of finished top I look then just going
ahead and applying concealer this is my
Maybelline age rewind concealer and just
using that to really clean it cut the
wing that we created as well and then
just blending it out underneath to
create a highlighted under eye then I
just smoked one of the warm colors
underneath and applied bottom lash
mascara and now it is time for the face
so for this I googled an angry in the
image I was using a firm reference I
also had a picture of myself up as well
with the snapchat filter on just for the
nose area when I did the shading but for
the lips and for the
kind of details of the skin and the
anger marks this is the image that I use
and like I said I literally just googled
angry cartoon dog then like I said going
back in with that 35 0m palette from
morphe I am just shading it in here's
the picture I used for reference on see
it's just me with the snapchat filter on
and I just kind of based the colors off
of that I lit she was dipping my brush
into so she knows so many different
colors so I can't be specific in the
ones that I use cuz I was just playing
and experimenting with them or but you
guys will be able to do it you literally
to be able to do this look you just need
a warm matte eyeshadow palette and a
white eyeliner and creative imagination
so yeah just going in with now I think I
was using a black eyeliner just to add
the little details of the nostrils and
outline or anything like that then I'm
just using a lighter eyeshadow to create
some depth and then going in with like
an eyeliner brush and a black eyeshadow
and creating the freckles then I'm just
kind of creating some shading going on
on the kind of frown lines going back to
the picture of the angry cartoon dog for
this just so I could use that for
reference and see what bits with darker
what bit well lighter cuz I'm a more
like a visual learner so I find it
easier to recreate things by looking at
them constantly and then I'm just
filling them in I think this would have
been a little bit better if I don't
block without my eyebrows so a little
tip if you want to do this maybe just
put foundation over your eyebrows a bit
more heavily to block them out because
it did create quite a dark area but I
think it worked out okay so I'm just
going in with loads and loads and loads
of different warm colored browns to
create a shaded effect then going back
in with that tortoise eyeliner just
outlining things to make it look a bit
more 3d and realistic and to get them to
stand out a bit more
just going in adding those of darker
bits around the side of the face as well
to create a more angry effect for the
mouth I feel I created the teeth and
then filled it in with white face paint
from Smithy's again using that picture
for reference it was super super easy to
do the teeth were actually the easiest
part I thinks and it was quite tedious
to film so I include that massively but
then just filling in the gaps with some
black paint to create more of like a
hollow mouth effect I think this look
looks much harder than it actually is
and it is honestly if you've got the
right picture and a creative mind is
very easy to do so yeah then going back
in with the tortoise eyeliner again just
to go around the teeth just because the
brush I was using for the paint wasn't
thin enough and I wanted to make sure it
didn't smudge anything see out going
back in with the eyeliner just to go
outside and outline the teeth and then I
just filled in at the mouth with the
black paint again
like so and then it just went back in
with a bit of brown eyeshadow around any
of the other bits to create some shading
and kind of emphasize the like folds of
skin there were definitely a lot more
lines that you could have added to your
skin so depending on how angry or scary
you want the dog to be it's totally up
to you how many you add then again just
going back in with the tortoise eyeliner
and just going over any of the dark
eyeshadow bits doing this just kind of
like I said adds the extra detail makes
it look a tiny bit more give it a bit
more realistic and just kind of
emphasizes the lines that you've created
then I went in with there's the gel of
blood on the teeth just to create the
kind of appearance of that we've just
been into something a gory
and I just added a tiny bit as well to
my forehead just because I wanted
something to be going on on the top as
well then I got these dog ears from ebay
I have linked them at down below but
they were really a bit floppy they
weren't really staying upright so I got
a safety pin and unlike unbent it made
it straight and then I pissed it through
at the top and then wait I pissed it
through the front then and and bent it
round underneath and then through the
back to kind of give it more other
backbone so I could bend it and it would
stay upright
like so
then I added this choker this is from
regal Rose I have also linked it down
below just cuz I thought it added to the
kind of dog effect and just wore a kind
of plain a brown t-shirt dress but that
is the finished look I really hope you
