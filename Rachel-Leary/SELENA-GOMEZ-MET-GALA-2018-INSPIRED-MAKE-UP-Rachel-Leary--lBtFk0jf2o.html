crashing down hey guys welcome back to
my channel so today's video is another
inspired look but this time it is the
Selena Gomez Met Gala makeup look this
makeup look was done by a hunk van Gogh
I'm obsessed with his stuff he does
incredibly complimentary makeup and it
always just looks so I don't know like
effortless and uses almost like minimal
product as well and just creates the
most gorgeous faces I love his work as
you guys know the Met Gala was literally
yesterday and there were some incredible
makeup looks so let me know who your
favorite makeup was in the comment
section down below as I showed earlier
this selfie of Selena literally just
caught my eye I just thought it was such
a different shape a different look
something that I never really have done
on my channel and I love recreating at
people's look so I thought why not do
this one I know everyone might not be a
fan of like the super nude lip or
anything like that by just thought it
would be fun to recreate you guys know I
love a good mood I love a sparkly eye
and I wanted to do it as best as I could
and I know hung it uses a lot of marque
Beauty because he is a Marc Jacobs
Beauty ambassador fortunately I do have
a lot of mock Beauty fortunately I do
have a lot of marque of beauty and
makeup products so I have tried to use
as many as I can just to kind of really
get the look but for the products that I
don't have I've used affordable at
substitute so I've really tried to mix
up obviously just use what you've got
and make use of what you have if you
love this look and want to recreate it
yourself so if you're liking the look of
this makeup look already please make

got this makeup look then please keep
watching
okay so like I said actually I'm not
sure I said it in the beginning of the
video how makeup artists use a lot of
mock beauty products because he is a
Marc Jacobs Beauty global ambassador and
I do fortunately have quite a lot of
mock Beauty stuffing on their pianist I
purchased some I love their stuff but
for the stuff that I don't have I've
tried to kind of use affordable products
so we're going to be kind of using a mix
of stuff throughout this video now her
skin kind of looked super satiny and
dewy so I'm going to be prepping my skin
and I'm actually gonna be mixing it
these two products together this is the
amok Jacob's a coconut primer and this
is the Marc Jacobs dewdrop skin do you
I'm just going to do a couple of pumps
of each on my face and just kind of give
me the best globe also prime my skin at
the same time I love the way these two
kind of work together I love that primer
as you can see I'm rich like finished up
with it it's such a nice feeling primer
on the skin feels super hydrating and
nourishing because I'll see it has
coconut elements to which is what that
does and those dew drops are literally
gorgeous but if you wanted affordable
dupes of both of those I would
definitely say like either the L'Oreal
drops that are out at the moment or the
Maybelline master strobe cream and then
for like an affordable version of that
primer the NYX total control drop primer
almost feels like that it's not as a
slick wet feeling as that but I feel
like they do the same kind of thing okay
now our skin is like set and glowing I'm
going to be up taking the mark Beauty a
shameless foundation I love this
foundation it's kind of super full
coverage but I'm gonna be using a damp
sponge to apply it to share it out and
give it more of that satiny feel and
look that Selena's skin had I'd be
surprised they use anything other than
this because this is kind of their
foundation that is their newest one and
that they're promoting at the moment and
it just honestly makes the skin and look
gorgeous and just like us I am using the
color the color I think it's why 420 420
blaze it um which is like one of their
tan I think it's like tan YB
or 20 just means a certain more of a
more all of the and town and it matches
nicely with the tan on my body
Serena was looking very tired that night
I feel like a few people had something
to say about her spray tan that she had
going on but I'm I'm all for fake tan
and spray tans so I was more interested
in what her makeup looked like then even
noticing that she had gotten a spray tan
so I just applied that with my Beauty
Blender to kind of help share it out and
allow the glow from underneath do it
come through the concealer I'm just
gonna be taking the makeup revolution
conceal and define in the shade see 8.5
I love this concealer you guys know
everyone knows how incredible this is
the coverage is amazing the color range
is extraordinary and I just like for the
price point which is four pounds this is
insane Selena did look as if she had a
slightly a brighter under eyes so I like
this one in the sense that it's not too
bright it just kind of blends really
nicely into the color of the foundation
without kind of looking too striking I'm
not going to be a cream contouring today
so that's kind of all the crema products
that they were going to be using for now
I'm just going to lightly go ahead and
set my face in place with my favorite
powder this is the Fuji bakery yellow
flower loose powder and I'm just gonna
do that really lightly I'm not going to
bake because she did look like she had
that like natural sweat glow look going
through which it's kind of up we won and
I'm also going to go ahead and do my
brows and to do that I'm going to use
the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz in
medium brown and just because house
looked very lightly feathered through so
just go ahead and do your brows the way
that you would I know brows can be quite
a specific thing and this is an inspired
look which is kind of why I'm switching
up and using a pencil because they
didn't look too defined or anything like
that and then it will be back to finish
off the skin okay so I just went ahead
and powdered my face
and did my brows and I was just gonna
use a pencil but then the more and more
I was looking at that picture of Salina
they were just so like feathery and I
don't have feathery eyebrows so I
grabbed my benefit gimme brow and I feel
like that is literally just like changed
my
so that's definitely like a must-have
product for the brows like this but now
let's go ahead and like I said finish
off the face okay so to bronze up my
skin and her skin was very bronze I'm
gonna be taking the tantastic Omega
bronzer from Marc Jacobs it's literally
like what the biggest bronzer that I own
I know that this packaging is I think
limited edition they do it sell it
regularly Lily Lily Lily now I'm just
gonna take a big brush and just work it
and to kind of parameters of my face my
cheeks I always forget about this
bronzer because I keep it not with my
regular bronzers because it's too big
and it doesn't fit I always keep it and
let my face palettes like draw
but this bronze is actually so good it
smells like coconuts the color is really
kind of natural and it blends so
amazingly into the skin I feel like it's
really buildable as well so just
applying that in all the places that you
would with a bronzer imagine putting
that right in your clutch bag no thanks
next up it is a little bit of a blusher
and she kind of had like a peachy vibe
going on so I'm gonna take the mock
Beauty lines and last night blusher
these kind of like mixed together really
remind me of the L'Oreal peaches blush
so again another affordable dupe for
this I'm just applying that on the
apples of my cheeks just something a
super light and natural because in the
picture you can't really see much of a
highlight either and her skin looked
fairly satin and general but not very
like highlighted so I'm just gonna take
the a Marc Jacobs glow stick in a
spotlight which is literally just like a
cream pearlescent highlighter just take
my finger and just dab it on the tops
and just work into the skin the warmth
from your finger will really help to you
know blend there
out and make it look like a super
natural glow and I feel like that's kind
of all she had really going on it wasn't
anything too intense it was just kind of
like a soft natural looking glow but
just the tiniest little bit more about
highlight I'm literally gonna take the
tiniest amount of those Jew drops again
I let you down one pump on the back of
my hand and taking my blank canvas
cosmetics brush okay always do just put
that on the top so again it's still
sticking with the like creamy looking
vibes there's no power to highlight
vibes going on just amplifying that I'm
just gonna place that on the ball of my
nose on my Cupid's were could have just
in all the usual spots but just
obviously using a cream instead I'm
gonna rub the excess back on all the
knuckles and on a towel so that is kind
of this incomplete I'm gonna go ahead
and spray up my skin with the golden
light tricks plus spray to set
everything in place and kind of add a
little bit of a moistured look to the
skin so I'm just gonna kind of let that
dry I'm gonna go ahead and it do one eye
because I just have a little play around
and see what's the best technique to do
cuz it's such a unique eyes shape that
she's been kind of given and created I'm
gonna test out a couple of products and
then I'll be back to show you because
this is literally my favorite part of
the whole er okay so like I said I think
her eyes are probably the most iconic
part of her makeup look and the perfect
palette I felt too useful this was the
makeup revolution times say Peters nails
palette it contains literally like an
array of colors this palette is
literally only 10 pounds we're gonna be
focusing more on like the foiled Goldy
green shadows and possibly a few of the
matte Brown shades but to begin with I'm
gonna be mixing these two shades
together here on the eye but to kind of
map out where we're going to be placing
them I'm just going to
in the marc jacobs Highliner in over
it's kind of like a muted olive green
kind of color and just kind of look
straightforward and map out the kind of
cut crease because she kind of created
her own so I'm just gonna go a bit
higher than my natural crease and just
take it down kind of in parallel to our
brows just kind of like so it doesn't
have to be very neat it just kind of
gives us a little bit of like a
guideline and a map bid you could use
you could use eye shadow to do that but
like I said I'm just gonna be mixing
those two boiled showers together and
going straight on to my lid with them it
was definitely like a golden olive like
really like yellow gold theme going on
and we are going to be kind of
concentrating that yellowy gold color
more with glitter so just kind of mixing
these olivey turns to act as a like a
base underneath that glitter so just
kind of really like pressing them onto
the lid and it does come out in a
slightly winged out fashion now we're
gonna go straight into the glitter I've
been using these so much recently this
is the Stila the glitter and glow liquid
shadow I think I'll use this in my eye
on a grand a tutorial as well everyone
that seems to just be loving the kind of
like thick chunky glitter vibe and this
gives that appearance but in like a
liquid forms I'm literally just gonna be
piling this on kind of majority of the
eye but kind of leaving out the end tail
part here because we are gonna be going
in with a bit of like a winged shadow
effect but literally taking this all the
way up to the new crease that we created
and just building up as much as you want
I thought a lot of the glitter was
concentrated mainly in the kind of like
center of the eye as you can see it's
gonna kind
really lay it down that color and I'm
also just gonna be taking a little bit
of the next glitter in a gold and like I
said kind of concentrating that mainly
just on the center portion of my I just
don't really like captures the light
just put a little bit of glitter glue
down just where I kind of want it to go
like they said maybe in the center and
just on really just creating this
intense golden glitter like so I'm now
just gonna be taking a another mark
Beauty high liner this is in the color
irony and it's basically just like a
really dark matte gray I'm just gonna be
running this along my lash line like so
just kind of creating like a
medium-sized line across my lid and then
just Tiny's there drag it out just
literally the tiniest bit because I'm
really gonna be creating the winged
shape with just a small angled brush
because these are so easy to blend I'm
just gonna be you see dragging and
blending that out with the brush her
eyes were very like a long elongated and
that makes sense everything was kind of
winged out so just kind of like so then
I'm just gonna be taking the Cherie
white shade from the same Sophie palette
and just one place that in my inner
corner and also just on my brow bone now
I'm just going to take a small pencil
brush and this kind of darker brown
shade here and I'm gonna run this along
my lower lash line
not really smoking out too far as you
can see because has wasn't super smoky
it was more just to kind of add a little
bit of warmth to complement her eye
color and then just kind of like connect
it all together so literally I'm just
gonna leave it like that
and finally it's time for mascara and
lashes I'm just going to
using the mac extended play just to
apply a like mascara and for lashes I'm
going to be taking the allure 201 you
can see they go from very very thin
- very winged out and that's definitely
the look she had going on like I said it
was so like elongated and sultry and
kind of cat eye age but still kind of
blown out at the same time so these
lashes gonna be perfect at so I'm gonna
go ahead and do that now so these are
the finished eyes they are kind of super
like artistic I love them I think
lashes are like perfect they're just so
subtle they look so like natural
eyelashes they're like perfect if you
just let a little bit of like elongation
if you know what I mean I'm obsessed
with just how like over-the-top and
glittery this airs and now it is time
for that
super nude lip I literally feel like I
almost don't need one her lip almost
looks like almost like foundation lip so
the first lipstick that came to mind was
myth by Max I'm literally just gonna go
ahead and apply that straight away and
no lip liner or anything and just kind
of really Pat it and work it into my
lips to kind of achieve the same lip
that she had going on just kind of
really like a soft but I do feel like I
need a bit of like definition somehow so
I'm just gonna take the south palette
and take that white shimmery champagne
shade and just kind of pop it on my
Cupid's bow just to kind of make it
stand out that little bit more Wow I
feel like this is the finished look so
this is my finished Selena Gomez make
out a 20-18 inspired makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it a
slightly different technique different
products all that kind of good stuff so
let me know your thoughts on it down
below I was obsessed with it in a sense
I just wrote something different really
kind of I want gone like I don't know
just something a little bit different
for me a different look so I really guys

favorite makeup look was from the met
