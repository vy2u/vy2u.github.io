and if you are new then welcome to my
channel and make sure hit that subscribe
button before we continue today's video
is gonna be a monthly favorites video so
we've just had obviously the month of
September how is it October all ready I
don't know October is my favorite month
is my birthday month and it's my
birthday on Friday by the way just so
you know I'm currently actually in
Morocco Marrakech with wise elves super
exciting but obviously still wanted to
and get video up for you guys and I
thought what a better way especially
because there's been so many exciting or
product releases recently I haven't done
one of these videos in ages so I thought
let's do monthly favorites so these are
all not all I guess but these are a
bunch of a products I've been loving in
the month of September or like that came
out in the month of September I feel
like you guys will appreciate maybe I'll
give you some of the new products to try
out so without further ado let's go
ahead and get started I actually have
quite a few of skinny head products in
front of me so I feel like September was
the month of skin so these didn't come
out in September but I've been really
loving them recently and they are both
from it and they are both from Nippon
fab and they are the glycolic fix daily
cleansing pads and at the beasting fix
toning pads I have seen such a
difference in my skin by using these
before makeup I let you just keep them
on my desk in front of me in the morning
I obviously like to either wash my face
or just kind of go over it again with a
wipe maybe and before makeup I then use
yeah I'm you go over my skin again with
the cleansing pads and the toning pads
and it just gets off all the excess down
I feel like makeup applies it's so much
better the atoning pads actually have
kind of like exfoliating kind of
qualities it to them so I really really
like them again yeah they just get off
the excess done for my skin my skin has
just felt so much softer Clara I haven't
had any breakouts and yeah my makeup
just supplies so much better and I feel
like it is to do with these so I've been
a really really loving these at the
moment the next time I actually have to
moisturizers the first moisturizer is
more of a bomb type moisturizer and it
is the glam glow a volcanic matte glow
and moisturizer I recently had the
pleasure of working with glam glow this
isn't a sponsored video by the way but
if it's because of that sponsored
content that I've literally fallen in
love and this have been using it all the
time it's literally like a bomb feel and
so when it applies it kind of melts into
your skin and creates like a breeze
subtle glow to the skin it's really
hydrating too but we
our kind of feeling really wet on the
skin I know Matt glow sounds really
weird but that is kind of the effect a
bomb has on your skin and that's
literally the effect that it kind of
gives off this also has priming
qualities to it too which I really love
it smells amazing it smells like vanilla
I think I said that in my video on
Sunday so yeah I've literally been
loving this and a another moisturizer
I've been loving is the origins ginseng
ultra hydrating energy boosting cream
now this stuff is more of your classic
wet skin moisturizer smells so citrusy
and so refreshing I love this kind of
out first thing in the morning everybody
revitalizes my skin anything that says
ultra hydrating I love it because I like
to think I have kind of dry skin so this
really again revitalize my skin they
also have like a matching eye cream to
go with this which I really really love
too so I guess you could say that is a
favorite - yeah I've been loving this
that one's definitely more about the
Barney moisturizer so if you kind of
have more like oily skin you might
prefer the feel of that one if you have
it dry - dehydrated skin like me I'm I
definitely recommend checking this one
out and plus it smells pretty amazing so
if you're always getting up pretty early
but you'd like to moisturize your skin
definitely try this one it kind of like
weight shop a little bit but a couple of
other skin related products I know we're
moving into autumn but I like to stay
tan all year round and a tan I've been
loving is the st. Moritz instr grad
tanning mousse and this one I think does
it just come in one shade I can't see a
shape on here but what I really love
about this is that it's instant and
gradual so if this one gives you a
really nice green base tan instantly
which is kind of like a light edge kind
of tan OC you'd like your skin changes
color and then overnight it developed
into really gorgeous dark golden tan
which i really really appreciate
I'll see you want like instant color I
just like the fact that this one kind of
gives a light color to start with and
then gets darker and I really love the
undertones of this - and also this
smells really good like I know a lot of
times have that really like horrible
kind of biscuity smell but this one
actually smells really fruity which I
really really appreciate so a little tan
for you guys and I feel like everyone
has been raving about this or like it's
been everyone's favorite this month the
fun T beauty foundation I am in
shade it 290 I'm wearing it right now I
love the makeup II based products I I do
have on my skin right now oh my god this
foundation there's like become one of my
favorites instantly it applies just kind
of like a normal foundation but the
coverage is literally amazing without
feeling too heavy on your skin it lasts
all day it's called the photofiltre
foundation and I genuinely feel like I
have a filter over my skin it really
does perfect your skin and it works with
the oily skin I feel like - and also
like all skin types because I feel like
I've got dry skin but this doesn't like
dehydrate much gonna make my skin feel
really tight
I literally literally love this I feel
like there is a shade out there for
everyone so if you still don't know
what's wrong with you haven't picked up
anything from the efendi Beauty range
I have hundred percent recommend
checking out the foundation I love it
the next two things going to talk about
are two highlighters one is the Ofra and
nikkietutorials collab in glow girls the
name literally says it all this
highlighter is literally glow goals it's
honestly like so pigmented it's like the
most gorgeous rose gold highlighter the
pigment in this is my head your said
incredible it gives such a gorgeous
highlight and glow to the skin it
literally pops out your face I love it I
know it's recently they had a big
restock saying it isn't available on
beautybay for us at UK gals then I will
leave it linked down below but it's just
so buttery it blends amazingly into the
skin it's such a like universal color
it's not too too light that I feel like
it looks really just kind of like placed
on my skin and I feel like this could
look gorgeous on a tanned and darker
skin if you'll see applied the correct
way and not too too heavily on and I
feel like it's also in light enough to
go on
pale skin tones because it's got that
can rosier undertone to it so I really
really have been loving that but also I
feel like I saw it said it was available
on Amazon but I'm not sure if that's
just people for the u.s. I know this is
already out in the US but I know it's
coming to the UK so hopefully this will
just kind of get you excited for it but
it is the master chrome metallic
highlighter from Maybelline in molten
gold this is definitely more of like
your classic gold highlighter it
honestly applies like butter ever since
I saw it being kind of released in the
u.s. I was desperate to get my hair
and then I went to an event with
Maybelline where they gifted us these
because they are coming at the end of
this year I'm so excited you guys get
your hands on these it honestly I can't
remember he literally just said it but
feels and applies like butter it's so
smooth and just glides onto the skin the
most gorgeous gold color I am obsessed
with this at the moment another product
from Maybelline that I've been loving
with just slightly weird it's actually
their brow attitude now how this works
is like it looks like this and it's kind
of like a paste that you'd paint on it
to your eyebrows in the shape that you
want I would apply it in a slightly
thicker layer because the aims that you
then peel it off so you want to be thick
enough to be able to peel off it applies
it super super dark but don't be
intimidated by that when you pin it off
it is the most natural looking color
this one is in the shade of a medium
brown I know there is a light brown and
there is a dark brown this is the medium
brown one so if you kind of have similar
hair color to me then I recommend this
one it says to leave up to 20 minutes
but if you want it - it kind of last for
a few days it says you can leave it on
for up to two hours so it totally ranges
I mean you could probably pick a time in
between for how long that you want it to
last for but I've really really been
loving this I was kind of scared of it
as first because I was scared that I'm
just gonna look like a complete stencil
on my brow but you can really customize
the finish of this I feel like at last
ages the color is really subtle and
natural so if you have kind of brows
that you wish were a bit more visible
definitely recommend picking a shade and
trying this out and the last two
products are going to be lip products
one is a lipstick and one is a lip gloss
I think this is lipstick came out this
month it is the Balmain and at L'Oreal
collab this isn't the painless nude
could urban Safari one reason I love
this is for the packaging it literally
it looks so amazing it's like a gorgeous
like royal green shade and the gold all
mane its logo just makes it look and
feel so expensive they are obviously a
little bit more on the expensive side
compared to the normal L'Oreal lipsticks
but this is just the most gorgeous pale
nude I'm probably compare it to like Mac
myth or Mac flash but it's that kind of
color so it is it really really pale but
I do I am wearing it now
do you like to darken it with a gloss
which I'll show you in a sec but I just
watched it there for you I just love the
formula I love the color there's
something also really nostalgic about
the smell of L'Oreal lipsticks they just
I don't know they remind me of like my
childhood but I love that color I love
the packaging I think that's such an
epic collab with like L'Oreal and
Balmain kind of bringing designer and
high-street together and creating the
most gorgeous lipsticks they had loads
and loads of colors some kind of kind of
quirky colors which I feel is really
appropriate for this time of year with
like Halloween and stuff coming up when
people are feeling a little bit more
experimental yeah I mean loving that
nude lipstick so if you're in the market
for a new nude then have a look at that
one and the final product is a gloss
that I've been reaching and reaching for
just because it makes my lips look so
juicy I've got it on it now is the a
Marc Jacobs lip lacquer in sugar sugar
I love the Marc Jacobs lip lacquers
anyway they're so thick but so
comfortable on the lip wanna see if you
get the try and apply some or buy one or
just try it out there's literally so
thick it's like a proper lacquer but
it's so comfortable I never have found a
formula like this where it's like
comfortable cuz a lot of lacquers of
that thick just feel really like sticky
but these feel amazing this is the most
gorgeous nude pink with a reflex of
glistening dirt you can see it on my
lips now I'll have posted a picture on
Instagram and I'm pretty sure I've
posted many pictures on Instagram
wearing this I don't know why this month
I've just been reaching and reaching for
this is yeah the most gorgeous nude goes
on top of like any nude combination
you've got going on and just makes your
lips look so juicy and kissable and
ready to so those were my favorite
products this month I really hope you
guys enjoy them I kind of tried to
include like a variety of products
