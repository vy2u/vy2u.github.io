in today's video we are gonna be doing a
a valentine's day inspired makeup
tutorial but this is kind of more
ancient people there already aren't
gonna be doing much because actually
it's however you want to take it let's
be honest I just guys thought maybe
because it's kind of a bright lip and if
you've got a boy or a girl and you're
gonna be kissing it's not ideal maybe if
you're going out to eat snow ideal bukas
this is just an ultra glam like I said
Valentine's Day inspired makeup look or
whatever day of the week whatever
they're just a little pink turns and I'm
just feeling the love it's love favorite

following me and staying up today thank
you all so so much for the love on this
hair i'm going to be doing an instagram
tutorial on this very soon so another
reason to make sure you're following me
on the ground this is going to be a
voiceover tutorial because I've had
drilling going on in this house all day
and I just feel like I'm shouting
otherwise but I've been kind of shiny
now I just feel like I'm shouting and I
haven't done a voice over in ages so I
hope you guys like it and I can talk you
through everything that we've done all
the products are listed down below let's
go
eight so to begin we got to get this
main out of our faces and for primer I'm
gonna take feet wire cell new to should
clout blowing primer in the pink shade
this is just meant to help kind of bring
it slightly paler skin tones to life and
kind of awaken you up a bit and plus
it's Valentine's Day and it's pink so
why the hell not and for foundation
using an old faith the fancy foundation
I used to shade at 290 and I just like
to blend it out with a Beauty Blender
you can see that this matches my turn my
face was looking abnormally pale but you
know that's the real me but don't tell
anyone now to conceal we are gonna use
the makeup revolution conceal and define
concealer if you still haven't tried
this yet what are you doing
run out to the shop and get it right
this second it's honestly the best top
shape tape dupe so full coverage like
I'm obsessively and their color range is
incredible and for contour again this is
an old favor I haven't used this in ages
this is the Anna Stiles I love it
the Anna stars er Beverly Hills darling
contour kit in mink is just a cool tone
cream at contour stick so I'm just using
that to kind of make my cheekbones look
like they're pop and a little bit more
and cano saying contour my jawline a
little bit more as well then we're gonna
set our face in place using it the Too
Faced Born This Way a powder but we are
gonna be applying glitter and pigments
and basically just kind of like a lot of
loose shadow type product so I am gonna
set underneath my eyes and leave the
powder there while we do our makeup just
so it's easier to a brush away you guys
know the trick but for eyebrows I'm
gonna be using the Mac a dip brow the
benefit process of my brow and the
anastasi at Beverly Hills clear brow gel
to set it all in place you guys now I
like to use a lighter pencil through the
front and a darker dip brow through the
tail and yeah set it all in place with
like the best a clear brow gel there
ever was the Anastasio one or products
are linked down below but for eyes I'm
gonna use the Kylie Burgundy palette
today I literally just screamed
Valentine's Day to me because I wanted
something to be very pink and very like
and I'm just gonna take this warm up
brown in the crease and just slowly make
my way through the matte crease colors
you guys know the drill they're all of a
very war
and pink undertone which was perfect for
this look you guys can use whatever
eyeshadows you want that kind of mimic
this palette I know the kylie palette
isn't the easiest to get hold of I know
makeup geek and Anastacio and color pop
do single shadows of a similar color so
you can kind of just create your own
with this one but yeah like I said just
getting darker and a darker to create
that kind of blown out look that you
guys know I'm obsessed with it's like
the easiest and most effortless eye as
well and I'm going to cut the crease
using the same concealer on the eye I
like to apply the concealer to my eye
and then look up so I can see where
abouts I'm gonna be going into the
crease with that concealer and to set it
in place I'm gonna be using this amazing
pigment from Peters makeup this is in
the color which is the most gorgeous
gold ever but obviously I wanted some
glitter and this is the violet Voss
glitter in champagne kisses I think you
don't have to add glitter if you don't
want to but I just wanted something
super sparkly and glam for Valentine's
Day and then just going back in with the
fluffy brush and the pink shade from the
Kiley palette to diffuse that and again
with the darker Brown to further deepen
up the crease to really smoke out the
look and then we like I said we can
brush all the glitter away or any
fallout that we had and it's not gonna
cling to our face because we put the
powder down and just to finish off the
eye with a pencil brush and that warm up
Brown to tie it all to and gather now
we're gonna use the benefit BADgal bang
mascara this is the first time I was
trying it look I'm obsessed but
obviously it wouldn't be a look without
falsies and these are the backstage last
year's in a girls night out which makes
perfect sense for this tutorial but now
we can cling cling what now we can
continue on with the face taking this
Too Faced bronzer I think it's not like
natural bronzer and has a gorgeous
shimmer to it and trying out this new
blush from bareMinerals this is in the
color like blini brunch I think
something like that oh my god if you
guys saw my Instagram stories I tried
this out on my arm I couldn't wait to
put it on my face this is from technic
cosmetics so it's super super affordable
it's just a liquid illuminator literally
look at the glow that it gives oh my god
and especially putting this on the top
this is the Anastasia Beverly Hills and
raising highlighter I don't even need to
explain it but it's out on Valentine's
Day which again it makes a sense from
this tutorial and for the lips I wanted
something pink so I'm taking the buxom
plump line in it
and less and using it to outline and
fill in all of my lips and then going in
on top with the Urban Decay a vise
lipstick in a big bang as well all these
products are like bangs so again kind of
perfect for Valentine's Day
but that is the finished makeup look so
this is the finished tutorial I really
hope you guys love it I hope you guys
have the most amazing Valentine's Day
or whatever day you are watching it this
on make sure to give it a big thumbs up
before you leave and definitely give it
a thumbs up if you want me to do that
hair Instagram tutorial as well next
time I see you guys will be on my other
social zone in New York I can't oh my
god I'll be seeing you very very soon
