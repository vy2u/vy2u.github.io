what's good don't get too excited hey
guys welcome back to my channel so this
is my first video with my brown hair
thank you guys so much for all the love
all net I was a little bit unsure if I
wanted to do it but I'm so bad I did
everyone says that they prefer I think
it just looks a little more healthier
and I am actually gonna get micro bonnet
extensions because my hair is still
really like thin and then I'll be happy
but as you can tell by the touch today
we are creating it the look that you saw
in the thumbnail this is like a
champagne smoky smoky leave a champagne
smoky deer tree at glam look which one
of my favorite looks to create I wanted
to come back with an ultra glam look
that I knew you guys would love that I
loved and that just would get me back
into the swing of things I'm gonna be
trying to you a lot about what's been
going on in my life recently as well so
definitely make sure to or watch till
the end if you like the look of this
makeup look already and you like the new
brown hair then make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and if this is the
first time on my channel welcome
Mitchard hit that subscribe button and
let's get started let's jump straight
into things so I'm gonna go ahead and do
my face verse because this is gonna be
kind of like around it I and as you guys
know I always prefer to do my skin first
what I'm doing around with is just
something I'm comfortable with but I am
gonna moisturize my skin with the
l'oreal hydrogenous
moisturizer this is such a low intensely
wet moisturizer I love it it smells like
that voice man I think I've said that
before but I'm military obsessed with it
okay cuz I'm feeling kind of lazy for
primer I'm gonna use the toothpaste
three and one hanger the X primer which
is also a setting spray as well so if I
remember I'll bring my face with this at
the end I shouldn't talk what I'm doing
that I love this kind of hangover X
range it smells so much of coconut so
I'm just gonna go ahead with my Road
Techniques brush just to kind of make
sure that's all pressed in to my skin so
I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you
what foundation I'm using and because it
was takes me forever to blend out now
I'm gonna start talking to you guys
about life and just everything that's
been going on so because I want like a
flawless full glam
finish I am
mixing at my to hourglass stick
foundations together in the shape golden
tan and light beige just because I'm not
as talent as my golden tan but then I'm
not as pale as my light beige and mixing
them together just makes the perfect
color for me but I do like to apply a
little bit more of the goldens hand
because you know me and I like to be a
golden turn if you've never tried this
foundation before it is like a little
bit of an investment but oh my god every
person that I've seen that I've thought
their foundation looks amazing flawless
and I just got to them like what is been
on your face most of the time they say
it's this and I have to agree it
literally of photoshop's your whole face
and I have been obsessing it for ages so
I thought this might be a video just
like my favorite glam products ever I'm
just gonna use my Beauty Blender to
blend that in so as you guys are aware I
haven't posted a video in like a week
which is a long time for me but
basically you just went through a few
personal bits at the beginning of the
week which kind of men I didn't really
feel myself I didn't want to be that
person that was like faking it in front
of the camera I mean I didn't take like
a massive break which is actually not
what I plan to do but I thought it would
be longer than it was but that was just
because certain things happen that sped
up my emotions and just made me realize
that life is too short and like things
have to go on and boys are dicks and who
needs them so I don't know if you can
tell by that what the personal thing was
that I went through Rach you're single
but it's a very like a long story but
this is like the first time in I never
like you guys when I got a boyfriend
like oh my god like you know type thing
but I've actually been involved with
that person to like four years so I've
never actually been officially like I
mean I've never actually been single
like the whole time that you guys have
known me as in like properly single but
now I am and it's weird I'm feeling good
about it it's kind of what inspired me
to like dye hair I was like on the fence
and then things happen I thought you
know what let's just change up my whole
life
let's die on how Brown let's be awesome
and let's just go from zero to 100 and
if you're like the biggest coding para I
have ordered like loads of new clothes
so yeah that's what's been going on with
me okay now the concealer I'm going to
be mixing two of the same again I love
doing that I'm mixing the collection
collection the collection lasting
perfection concealer in the shade warm
medium which is in the shade three and
then I'm going to use the shade fair to
kind of like help brighten up and leave
my eye so this shade is just kind of
gonna give me a little bit of brightness
but kind of more conceal any darkness
underneath my eyes didn't ask me what
that was or if I thought it was good
because and I'm just gonna blend that in
first again using the same bu D AB
alinder so you can see like it kind of
fades to be the kind of color on my face
at the moment but I do want it to be a
little bit brighter so that's why I'll
go back in with that shade there now I
didn't think this was gonna be my first
video because I do have a vlog that
needs to go up from my Meetup and just
like a little chitchat with you guys and
I thought that was gonna be the first
one to go up because it's in partnership
with the people that I did the meet up
with I still went head back whether or
not I can upload it yet so I feel like I
don't wanna make you guys wait for a
video I wanted to upload this one but in
that one I like start the video with
blonde hair and finished with brown so
it's like the watch it's funny and I
just love documenting meeting you guys I
feel like even though I'm even I say it
in the video that you'll see but I feel
like those kind of vlog videos don't
always do so well on a channel like this
but on a channel like this there's like
I get given so many incredible
opportunities to like want to meet you
guys and to do things like that so I
always personally want to document them
and upload them to a place that I'm
gonna be able to watch them forever
so it will mean a lot to me if you guys
give me a little love in that video it's
just like a sign of your support it
honestly means so much whether it's just
a watch for like two minutes or the
whole thing or a thumbs up or a comment
like it just means everything but now
I'm just gonna blend that and I just
kind of applied it in dots because I
didn't want to apply it too much product
but you guys know the pups of a beauty
blend it makes sure that you don't apply
too
product I always make sure to a bill and
I wear that one of these okay so those
all the kind of creams I'm going to be
using with my face so I'm gonna take
this pur cosmetics contour Diaries
palette which Phillips looks like this
is a powder contour kit and I'm gonna
mix the shades charm and dream together
to kind of initially set underneath my
eyes and I always like a yellow powder
because I feel like it helps to brighten
up more if you want to I'm just gonna
press that in place hmm just kind of in
all the places that I applied concealer
like the brightening one and then I'm
just gonna go ahead and set the rest of
my face with my Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder now I'm
sufficiently locked and set in place I'm
gonna go ahead and do my eyebrows
off-camera same technique just using
some different products today but of
different shades that I usually use so
I'm gonna take my medium dip brow from
Anastasia Beverly Hills in wait I see my
medium dip brow just my anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in medium brown's
like to tell my brows my Benefit
Cosmetics precisely my brow pencil in
the shade 3 to feather them up at the
front and my benefit gimme brow in the
shade 3 to it set everything in place
and then I probably will Scott the mouth
concealed underneath I'm gonna have done
all that I will be back okay brows are
done and I think I'm gonna finish off
the face - highlighter and lips before
we move on to the eyes so I'm gonna go
back in with the contour palette that we
used earlier and I am gonna take the
secret out you know the passion color
just because it's slightly month but
then I think I'm gonna use it the secret
color so I prefer the contour and then
also contour my Norris Norris Nourse so
I'm just taking those slightly more
color always kind of applying it like a
bronzer because it is color and this is
the color that I'm gonna kind of take
onto my forehead as well this is a
really pretty part it's the first time
I've actually used this palette I feel
like because I wasn't that active on
social media but I was still receiving
all these packages and stuff like I'm
behind don't know what you guys might
have or haven't seen or like want to see
ok so now I guess I'm gonna take that
secret color which is the slightly
cooler contour color and just kind of
use that to like tighten up and enhance
Conte all just kind of create more of
the illusion of a shadow I'm just gonna
dab a tiny little fluffy brush into that
secret color and just contour my nose
now that's done I'm gonna warm up my
face little bit and I'm gonna take this
bh cosmetics blush up in the shade
Bahama bronzed so it looks like this
it's kind of a Kiseki warmer peachy
earth but slightly deeper turn bronze
bronze blusher so I'm just gonna kind of
apply that onto my cheeks and circle it
backwards a little bit and then to kind
of warm up and add a little bit more
like a shimmery warmth I'm gonna take
this baked bronzer from Milani in the
shade in the shade below and just use my
big fluffy brush just warm everything up
you guys know I love doing this yeah so
I'm gonna take a pause there and up cuz
I always kind of like to apply my
highlighter last so I'm gonna go ahead
and do one eye off camera because I have
no idea what I want to do and I want to
make sure I get it right the first time
so I'm gonna go and have a little play
and then I'll be back to show you what I
came up with okay so this is what I came
up with I'm like gagging you could put
lashes on because I'm obsessed I love a
glittery glam look
I'm loving the products I used as well I
use a few new kind of palettes and like
maybe some products I haven't used in a
while so let's go ahead and get started
so for the eyeshadows I'm at taking it
this julius place actually palette I've
heard so much about this brand kind of
maintained through nikkietutorials the
shadows are so pigmented so they've
recently launched on a beauty base it
makes it much easier for us UK people to
get hold of them so I'm gonna go in this
is the palette by the way how gorgeous
is there I'm gonna go in with this color
here as our initial transition color on
a big fluffy brush I'm just gonna go
back and forth creating that blown-out
shape that you guys know I
let you I just dipped my brush in that
one and I've literally just done the
whole color like that a slightly smaller
brush I'm gonna take this color here
which is just a slightly deeper brown
and just concentrate that mainly on the
outermost part but then just buffing
back and OH
I like to just go back in with the
previous brush just to make sure it's
all it diffused together and then with
what little product is left on the
previous brush it yeah like just helps
to make sure everything is really
blended and nicely I'm then gonna mix
this color with the dark brown matte
shade just because I kind of want to
create my own middle color if that makes
sense I don't want to go fully in with
the dark dark yeah but I want there to
be a little bit more darkness compared
to the previous color to create the
gradient so I'm just again buffing that
mainly in the outermost part and then
back okay that's what I'm gonna do up
the shadow at the moment I'm now gonna
go back in with my collection concealer
and in the shade three so the slightly
dark one of the two and just take it on
a little concealer brush and just really
blank out my crease as you can see the
half cut crease I've created isn't
really like sharp that's not the kind of
aim of this I'm just kind of one putting
this down as almost like a shadow primer
as the shadow we're gonna use is of the
pigment types I once I want to cling to
something and this just creates a really
nice base for underneath so we can
really see the color like soon okay I'm
so excited to use this because we are
gonna be using this on our face as well
and I do actually think it is a
highlighter but I'm taking the makeup
forever stardust powder in the shade 13
this is the most gorgeous like champagne
gold I'm obsessed I let you put it on my
eye early when I was paying around and I
was like oh I'm just gonna press this on
my lid where we put the concealer hello
I literally think this is the most like
poppin champagne gold type pigment
I have ever used and I can't wait to put
that on my face later so I'm just gonna
take a little bit of a glitter glue on
back of my hand and put that on top of
that because on top of that pigment I'm
gonna take this glitter from lit
cosmetics it is the shade fully nude
it's again it's just a beautiful gold
color to add that extra sparkle I'm just
using my finger turn pilot don't worry
if it falls down because we said it all
with powder it should just wipe away but
I find a finger just packs on the
glitter like the best that it can and
I'm just gonna go back in with the
fluffy brush and just wipe away any
glitter that's kind of transitioned up
onto our like lid and then or wipe away
the bitter from underneath so I'm just
gonna go back in with that matte brown
shade and just diffuse what's going on
just lightly between the glitter and the
matte crease colors like so just so it's
not such a harsh transition but to make
it even less of a hard transition I new
take this gorgeous a coppery metal metal
foiled shadow from the palette and just
create a transition of warmth between
them see that yes okay I'm now dipping
at my brush back into this color here
but then mixing it with the darkest
matte of the palette on a slightly more
defined crease brush and just
concentrating this on the outer
outermost part of the lid to really
smoke it out and then again just picking
up my previous brushes to help diffuse
the color but that is the top of the eye
done
I'm now going to line my waterline with
an Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
and this is in the shade roche it's like
a really gorgeous dark brown with like a
warm glitter running through it so Tony
ties in with the eyes and it's gonna
make it look really sultry and smoky I'm
now gonna take a pencil brush and again
that Mac dog Brown and really smoke out
my lower lash line I am gonna
concentrate this quite close to my lash
line and then take one of the fluffy
brushes that we've used before to just
really buff it out and just connect it
back around
then like I said just really buff it out
underneath I'm then gonna dip my brush
back in it to that make up forever
Stardust powder and use that to
highlight my inner corner girl ah it's
poppin' is poppin I'm now gonna go ahead
and apply it mascara and eyelashes and
some mascara I'm gonna take the paradise
ecstatic Messara I've been loving that
at the moment and then for lashes I'm
taking these from backstage Beauty Fair
in the style Melrose Avenue there that
really kind of gorgeous Lily lashes
Miami dupe type vibe so super luxurious
super wispy I can't wait to show the
finished eyes and remember obviously
lover I love looks like this these
lashes are becoming my new favorite ones
they kind of I like dramatic but not
depends literally on my eye makeup
because my eye makeup right now is
dramatic it kind of makes them look
really dramatic but I wear these would
like barely any eye shadow and they just
look super flattery and natural for
everyday so you've never tried that like
style before definitely check them out
ok moving back onto the skin I am just
gonna finish up by highlighting so I am
gonna go ahead and apply the anastasia
beverly hills peach fizz liquid
illuminator just take my Beauty Blender
and apply that to the tops of my
cheekbones yes
I literally obsess over this stuff so
once we've applied that cream at base
like I said I'm gonna go back in with
that starlet powder and I am aware this
is a very iridescent pale powder so I
literally tapped majority of it off I'm
just gonna lightly dust it across the
cream cuz I'm aware it's gonna cling to
that but that's why it's gonna look so
intense and pop in and glow in to the
woods we have not come to play today
blow hard or go home I say okay glow is
complete and now it wouldn't be a
comeback to look from me of like a
favorite nude eye makeup look without a
popping nude lip so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply Mac strip down liner all
around my lip
and then I've been loving this liquid
lipstick from BH Cosmetics is in the
color sandy which is quite a pale nude
and then because I didn't get to before
and loads of you guys asked me to I'm
gonna use the new NYX Cosmetics cosmic
metals lip cream in metropolitan nights
you have been really loving this liquid
lipstick from BH Cosmetics they have
such good quality products and I use
summer death pact before but they really
kindly gifted me a massive box of that
stuff to try and I'm obsessed like
perfect shade of nude honey and I came
to a perfect shade of nude for me I want
this to be like really nude and poppin
or just look like slightly more on the
new decide to tie it in lip the eye is
like gold these are really comfortable
they literally glide on these are the
looks that live for what I remember I'm
gonna go ahead and use that to face to
spray again to everything in place and
then this is the finished look
so this was the finished makeup tutorial
