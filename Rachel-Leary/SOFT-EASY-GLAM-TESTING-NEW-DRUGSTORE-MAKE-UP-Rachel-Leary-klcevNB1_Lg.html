or if you are new then welcomed in
general and make sure to hit that
subscribe button down below
today I'm going to be testing a bunch of
times like new in drugstore makeup so
makeup met him to be slightly more on
the a suitable size so yeah I just kind
of went to my local boots and Superdrug
saw loads of new a bit and also I got
sent some new bits from some companies
that are stopped in there as well and
those of you guys wanted me to kind of
test it out so I want to do something
quite simple and pretty because I feel
like that's what a lot of you guys first
you have a lot further ado I feel like
we should just get straight into it so
it's about with I mean I moisturize my
skin so many of you guys recommended
this to me this is the gagne and
moisture balm moisturizer so idiots who
put dehydrated skin this is going to be
amazing it literally feels like jelly on
my skin like a ream intensely
moisturizing jelly you know and my skin
has been so dry recently so I definitely
wanted to try this out oh my god it
literally leaves my skin feeling so
smooth selfless so let me just get these
baby hairs out the way what do you guys
think of the slightly darker roots by
the way I feel like I kinda want to go
dark all over it's making my eyes look
really blue asthma so let me know what
you think
anyways moving on I recently discovered
that elf is now stocked into just I got
a few bits from there and this is the
illuminating face primer so I saw a lot
of products that we look to really like
glowy and dewy after like with the
summer and stuff that's a really popular
look so that is the kind of look that
I'm going for today so I'm just going to
apply ok it's like Yellin look Oh a few
pumps I don't actually know how like
this is going to work
oh ok so I hope I'm that leaves a
slightly like soft silicone you finish
by not sure you can see it the
yellowness of it actually has quite like
a nice golden like right
you on the skin which would see when it
said it was illuminating what is what it
meant
I can't tell that's like actual glitter
particles or not right and looking
pretty illuminated illuminated and
glowing illuminated glowy and that under
the moisturizers actually definitely
skin feeling yet really a really soft
but the Argos are quite they're like
bronzy do we nip today so I also wanted
to try it like a and liquid illuminator
underneath the skin as well and I saw
this and it's from border is called
their boiler sculpt bronze like
illuminator basically like a liquid
glowy a bronzer so you guys know me I
love like liquid bronzers and anything
like that so I might put my hands are so
soft and all those products the contacts
you get it off so I'm just going to do
like a couple of pumps of my faith and
it's going to add a little bit more Chi
to my face as well hopefully it's not
going to like ruin primer so I'm just
going to apply this with a duo fiber
brush this smells really yummy and it
doesn't leave too much of like a tent to
the skin some liquid runs if I feel like
really really like darkness again you
can't get away with wearing them
underneath the makeup that this looks
really pre I wouldn't probably recommend
doing this if you have oily skin because
that's just going to like add to the
shine I am a little bit worried about
the foundation and then I put on because
there wasn't a test áfourá
but I could just see that the one above
it was too pink and then the one above
that was just like the lighter shade and
so I got the shade caramel I feel like a
loads of you are going to tell me it's
way too dark but I'm gonna try and make
it work I don't know if it is too dark
yet but we'll see but no now that is all
applied to the skin I actually love the
way I'm like glowing
I love liquid bronzers already so I
really like that my skin again it feels
super soft matte moisturizer and primer
so things looking good so far
auntie foundation like I just said this
is the elf flawless finish foundation
and this is the shade caramel now I'm
pretty sure this is going to be a little
bit too dark for me please
bear with me I'm going to try and make
it work as much as I can but I will get
money about drugstore foundations that
on a massively renowned foundation brand
that makes sense once you've got like
Maybelline L'Oreal they're like bound to
be good and trustworthy but this one has
tried something completely different so
I don't know how much I'm going to need
if I'm just going to do one pump so far
and I'm going to use a damp sponge to
blend this out okay off the bat that
absolutely stinks like that doesn't
smell good that smells like play-doh oh
my god that smell
let me know if you guys have tried elf
products before I feel like it was a
mainly American brand but the colors not
as dark as I thought it was going to be
so I'm just going to try and work with
it because I am a little bit tanned at
the moment sir it's not too bad and to
be fair I only needed one pump that and
that's gone like more than enough
coverage Oh God especially I'm like
bouncing it around my nose that really
doesn't smell good I definitely think
the sponge is a good sharks it was quite
sick because literally only two pumps
and it covered my whole face and the
coverage is actually really pretty and
so is the finish but I ain't down for
having a stinky foundation on my face
foundation is complete so far I'm really
liking the coverage and the finish of it
the only downside was the translatory
smell so I'm now gonna move on to
concealer and this is be a Bourjois
healthy mix concealer in the shade 52 at
medium now I've tried the Bourjois
healthy mix foundation although when I
was in there I think they'd like redone
it
I think I'm not sure but I was going to
get that foundation but I want to try
this on but I wanted to try the
concealer because I love the foundation
like I said so I wanted to see if this
concealer was just as good
now this always smells really yummy and
what if it smells like berries or
something but this is in the shade
medium I'm just going to be placing it
underneath my eyes it has one of those
like lip gloss applicator type things
which I kind of like I'm just going to
be applying that like at the bridge of
my
and all the usual spots and I'm going to
use the same sponge but now just the
tapered end to blend that in and then
hopefully this will help kind of light
up our foundation I always like to take
onto my eyelid as well don't forget to
help us prime a little bit but no this
is super blendable I really like the
color like the yellow undertone of it I
really really like because it really
helps to brighten up underneath the eye
doesn't feel too heavy or like dry on my
skin I feel like it's blending out
really easily I've never done without
really nicely and I really like the
color that that was the shade medium I
was going to get the lighter shades and
sort nerves just in case that foundation
really institude up I don't want to look
like old-school drag so we're going to
leave it as that but we are going to a
little bit of a cream contour today I do
I was going to use my Rimmel London kind
of contour sticks but I kind of realize
I've used some already so that wouldn't
really be like a first impression or
just like trying out for I haven't used
is the Rimmel London concealer and
contour palette so I'm going to take the
dark shade of this one business in the
shade medium anyway so just a medium
tone one I'm going to take the contour
shade to a cream contour now just
looking at it this is a lot more like
yellow toned than the contour stick vibe
in user which I actually think I might
prefer because this one just kind of
warm up and give a nice olive toned
bronze or almost slightly more like of a
ready brown undertone but I'm liking
this life and you can take it do a fiber
brush too but now yeah I really like the
color of their a really nice kind of
medium toned Brown it doesn't look too
muddy on the skin like some can be quite
cool and Tainan and yet end up looking
really muddy I think that's a brilliant
nice color it's not too dark it's not
too orange you just gives a very nice
runs
now to set it all in place I'm going to
take the Oromo in step six and mapped
translucent pressed powder and just
press this underneath my eye area just
to make sure it's all set in place I'm
going to set my lids as well as my
forehead I make sure to search in area
as well lovely lovely but then on the
sides of my face where I want a little
bit more coverage I'm going to be taking
the Maybelline fit me powder in the
shade 250 I like to take a little kind
of flat contour brush like this and like
always butter into the skin and that I
find gives a really like airbrushed
finish I love the fit me range so I
definitely wanted to try the powder
mother looks very let's not let me down
I think I'm just going to go ahead and
like do all the skin besides highlighter
pieces and I like to move on to brows so
for the rest of the skin I'm actually
going to take via bronzer from this
palette this is the collection highlight
blush and bronzer and yet like I said
I'm just going to take via bronzer from
it this is actually a angled brush from
skinny dip
I've been loving these at the moment I'm
just going to bust this up I just kind
of go over where we put that cream
contour it's quite like a dark color but
nothing's really coming up on my skin
let me try different brush I'm going to
try something with a bit more sort of a
precision you do that's a bit better
still not like a great amount of
pigmentation but I presently want more
like a soft bronzer then that's quite a
nice palette and it's quite easy to
travel with Islam or blusher someone
recommended the makeup revolution kind
of like ombre blusher now this is in the
shade rose quartz what so I'm just going
to go ahead and take my brush brush and
kind of concentrate it more in like the
Pink Zone ooh and this is actually
labeled as a gradient highlighter so
there is like a bit of a glow to it and
I kind of wanted to go to like a really
you like we look so I'm going to go
reading light on the eyes and I kind of
wanted to have like really flawless
stony skin that's really pretty
Thank You Emily okay you guys know I
love a shimmery bronzer so I saw this
from a makeup revolution is there strobe
highlighter in the shade rejuvenate and
I just like to take a big fluffy brush
and like swell a brush all in it oh my
god I don't know if you can see that but
no I really okay it looks okay okay it's
better once I blended it with my sponge
so it is quite like a muddy undertone
which I hadn't quite realized I'm gonna
kind of play something more like a
contour okay so you definitely barely
need like any of this nice pretty much
give me like you can see my forehead
like a nice bit of a glow but pretty
 that kind of just like to post it a
lot and it wasn't like that much nice of
her other color if anyway we're not
going to do highlights yet because I'd
like to go ahead and do my brows first
so for that I'm going to use the new
Loreal brow gel pomade from their
paradise ecstatic collection and I'm
going to set them in place the NYX
tinted brow mascara in chocolate which
I've never tried before so I'm going to
go ahead and it zoom you in and do my
brows
okay so I've done other to try and use
the brush that it came with or what but
it comes in one of the things like this
with the little brush like this I'll see
how the brush works with it but this is
in the shade 103 which I shall it might
be a little bit too light for me now
I've got these dark roots I'm just going
to go ahead and kind of start ok I'm not
liking that brush so I'm going to stop
with that brush and use my good old
Anastasia Beverly Hills brush
I've always the tail of my brow that's
like the test yeah
so the end of that is just little the
color that it's just slightly too light
for the end of my brow so I'm going to
need to go ahead and grab something
different by any unit to fill in the
front cause I do like to use a lighter
color to the front but after the full
you know it seems pretty good so far no
it creates a good a nice color is really
look so dark like in this part but when
it hits the skin it's really not so I'm
just going to go ahead and grab
something dark to fit in the tail of my
brown so I just went ahead and filled in
my other eyebrow doing the same but I
said she just put in like an Anastasia
Beverly Hills bit rather a slightly
darker do the air the ends but not I
really like the folly of that L'Oreal
one so I'm now going to go ahead and fit
them in case using that NYX brow gel in
the shade chocolate just to kind of warm
them up and lighten them slightly you
guys know I like to put like a slightly
lighter brow gel through my brow just as
if I like it adds a little bit more
dimension and like turn I like that one
I made them look pretty accessories I
mean now we can go ahead and highlight
the skin now the browser is done and for
that I'm going to take the anyway luxe
globing the highlighting powder in it
gold now this is like a loose powder
highlighter which I've actually been
really liking at the moment I've been
really loving the Kylie one in it fiji
so we'll see how this one Cove
sorry I just tried to swatch on my hand
I can already tell like I will go ahead
and spray it with like 6 plus and I now
gonna go ahead and just like bust this
on to my cheekbones
ah ok let's just go work this in
actually no I quite like that when that
first applied though I think we all
thought like what the is she just
partner face but I think it if I use
this is like a bigger brush it wouldn't
be like blenders nicely and definitely
use a set like fixed glass barrier
settings for something just to give it
something to like mold together with
I'll go ahead and apply on this side as
well
on the end of my nose it is a very
pretty of gold like I actually don't
have many highlighters that proper come
out like a really nice gold so that
actually really prettier
I was scared at first what was happening
on my face but no I think that's really
pretty ok now the skin is all complete
we can move on to the eyes now I'm so
happy that I found this I don't actually
own this already and it's the next lid
laundry palette so literally just got
six iPhones in and they're all of a
matte finish which i think is pretty
rare in the drugstore can never find
it's just a completely matte eyeshadow
palette so I don't want to be too
intense in the eyes today like I said I
kind of wanted to keep it really light
angelic and doughy because we are going
to be putting like a white eyeliner in
the rules language I haven't done in
ages so I kind of wanted eyes to match
so I'm just going to be taking this
light pink shade here and we're going to
use that as our initial transition color
it's going to bust that crease it's just
like a really nice it looks tape it's
actually a really nice soft brown so
this is such a good palette if you keep
your eye makeup really as simple and you
just like one or two colors in the
crease which is what we're going to be
doing today because like I said I wanted
to keep it quite light so now I'm going
to go ahead and take this shade here to
the slightly darker color again just
rather deepen up the crease I'm actually
going to take this a little bit further
on to the crease because for the lid
shade we are going even like an eye
paint that we could use to kind of
almost create a like half cut crease
look so it can be quite free with this
warm color because I really wanted to
show up I always just make sure to go
back in with the previous brushes to
blend at all oh yeah we will stop there
just at the crease color and now that I
said we're going to use an eye pink
which I've never really used before and
this is from L'Oreal this is in the
shade 205 cookie disk paint it all
straight onto the eye oh this is really
pretty
mine either
can cope just here this is a really nice
product to do that is really pigmented I
love this color for like everyday that's
like super quick to apply as well I hope
they kind of like a drying as shimmery
as they come out you see how like
effortless that is I love looks like
this like super easy literally go would
go with like any outfit but we'll see
how they were but I'm only time taking
that like half way three spaces away
across oh my god I don't know is that
like a trial not because I'm not I
hadn't planned to like put anything on
top I'm just going to go back in with
that second crease color that we use to
just diffuse it together on the lid I
just like to do that using like circular
motion so it's not a sudden stop and
everything can blend oh pretty here and
now we're going to take a it slightly
smaller definer brush and it just take
this dark shade here it's a slightly
warmer one out the two by many different
places really lightly in the outermost
part and then just blend upwards I know
it's really pretty do you think I mean
it's annoying because the one thing I
will say about this I paint is they do
literally look like painted on they
don't I can't necessarily like the
nicest blend across the lid but just
using my finger just now to kind of tap
that in have made that actually a little
bit better so loving that I'm now going
to go ahead and apply it the L'Oreal
paradise ecstatic Kajal white eyeliner
in my waterline because like I said I
wanted like a really pretty look and
it's going to really help open up your
eyes the it shape of that actually
really makes it a lot more comfortable
to apply to it's not like one of those
pencils that you sharpen and twist and
stuff and it can be a little bit like
like when it's like super sharp and
actually a really nice white it's not
too too bright though it's kind of like
scary but yeah it's bright enough that
you can see it now I'm just going to
take a pencil brush and this shade here
and run
along my lower lash line as well select
that ties everything together really
nicely so now I just need something for
a inner corner highlight so I actually
might get back in to that blusher
bronzer highlighter palette from
collection and just take the highlighter
shade and paste that in my inner corner
ooh love that I almost got my eyes look
so bright and awake I love it so now I
know now now now I'm going to go ahead
and use the l'oreal paradise ecstatic
mascara in black and I'm loving this
like rose gold packaging so this is the
brush almost look a little bit like the
Too Faced better than sex mascara brush
if you've ever used that so I'm now
going to go ahead and just apply Loco
pretty nice right it's not too clumpy a
pretty well separated they have like
kind of like a wispy effect to them I
think they look really separated and
really nice I almost feel like I don't
want to wear lashes but it's me so well
just below that these are from the brand
pinky hope you can get in Superdrug
they've come out with these 3d silk
collection ones so they're still pretty
cruelty free they're not mink but they
just look like these I mean they look
like me brushes and just thought this
style was so gorgeous business in the
style adapt adapt I think or something
but they look like this super winged and
wispy I thought they would kind of
really tie in with like the dough I
could say to got going on so I'm going
to go ahead and apply these of camera
and then it shows they look like once
they're on guys I'm literally in love
with this eye look I know you're
probably all thinking it's like looks
like I do all the time it makes me so
happy finding like affordable drugs to
work so we can like all get our hands on
not for like crazy brands are really
hard like and then you can still achieve
that like really glam look so that's
kind of why I love doing these looks and
kind of still looks like so that you
guys appreciate so I love these lush as
well
super super easy to apply but now we
cannot finish up with the lips so I'm
going to be lining my lips with the ax
Revlon Colorstay lip liner in the shade
nude now I always get a little bit funny
about twist up eyeliner because
sometimes they can mean like too soft
and like they just kind of crumble it's
proving to be okay this is a nice medium
shade of nude love that and now I'm
going to take one of the Rimmel stay
matte liquid lip colors and this is in
the shade Atlanta to go is one of their
noodle paler shades because if I wanted
it to be a like I'm wearing like baby
pink I just kind of load it all to tie
in and those of you asked me to try
these because I'm going to try the nude
one class so oh being so these feel
really like Lucy but I really like the
color it's like a really nice nude they
do take a little while to drive me like
a pie like a mousse and then dry and not
like flick your anything right I'm going
to go ahead and apply a paler gloss so
now I wasn't going to use the new NYX
cosmic metal shade that just female but
I did look for online when I was linking
other products down below and it's not
available yet for like us UK people so I
wanted everything that I'm using to be
available to you guys now if I'm going
to take the Maybelline hot lacquer in
the shade 60 T's which is a gorgeous
pale nude I think just to kind of tie
everything together and then obviously
you guys would be able to get this now
but I definitely want to try this again
in the future but I do apologize mmm oh
my god oh my god this is such a baby peg
up okay maybe just slightly to appeal
for this look okay so that's a little
bit to pair this look but luckily I do
another lip gloss option I'm going to go
ahead and apply the L'Oreal extreme
resist and like lip gloss on top in the
shade 507 resist me I love that
so this is kind of the makeup look
complete by I'm going to go ahead and
spray my face would be primed and
already a fixing that spray from a
collection just so everything is all
looks improve and just freshen
everything up but this is the finished
makeup lip so this was the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and enjoyed me is kind of
testing out all this new stuff I
literally loved most of it actually
although now I'm trying to talk the lip
gloss and lip sync together don't
necessarily work writing this because I
had so many lip glosses on anyway I was
not testing out all this new stuff I
definitely it found some new kind of
Prosise thing I'm going to be reaching
for a lot more so I really hope you guys
