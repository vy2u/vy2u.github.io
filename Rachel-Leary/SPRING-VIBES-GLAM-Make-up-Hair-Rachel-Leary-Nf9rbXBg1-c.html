today I was feeling really inspired to
do a bit of color and I kind of wanted
to use complementary colors so I went
for like purple and a yellow gold so I
feel like I haven't really done that on
my channel I thought this was a really a
gorgeous kind of appropriate look for
spring as well and I've also included
how old like I know it's not difficult
but like how I straighten my hair
because loads have you been giving so
many compliments to me on my straight
hair and I've got naturally frizzy hair
and I find it really hard to keep it
straight so stay tuned to the end if you
want to see kind of how I achieved my
straight hair and keep it that way I
haven't done like a really curly hair
girl looking ages so I definitely want
to do a lot more hair and makeup
tutorials together so stay tuned for one
I think maybe next week with the
voluminous curls yeah I just want to do
it something a little bit different with
color today so I really hope you guys
enjoy if you do make sure to give it a
thumbs up and if you want to know how I
got this look then please keep watching
this is starting with our eyes and
eyebrows first I'm gonna use two shades
of the Benefit Cosmetics cabral I'm
using the shade for kind of towards the
tail of my brow just because it needs to
be slightly dark because I extend it and
then I use shade three towards the front
so one just slightly lighter so it kind
of creates that gradient I like to use
like a feathering motion as I get
towards the front so kind of more
upwards motions as you can see here just
because I feel like this creates a more
realistic appearance of hair like at the
front and then I find it easier to
create that gradient and blend the two
colors together then I'm just gonna
sculpt out my brow using the maybelline
camo concealer palette and just taking
this light peachy shade here and just
placing this underneath my brow and just
cleaning up any mistakes and this is
also gonna act as a brow bone highlight
as well then I'm just going to set
everything in place using the 3d brow
turns from benefit as well and this is
in the shade too so this is just
slightly lighter than my kind of kind of
I'm using my brow because it gives the
appearance of a more 3d brow then I'm
just gonna go ahead and apply a
concealer as my base this is just the
NARS concealer and it is the one I plan
to use on my face so I'm just using that
to cancel any discoloration and then
going in with this colour-pop cosmetics
palette this is the low-key palette and
I'm taking this yellow shade here we're
not gonna be too intense in the crease
with our crease colors so I'm just
taking this yellow shade and buffing it
in on a Mac two to four for our initial
transition color and then to further
deepen the crease I'm at taking this eye
shadow from NYX is called cougar and
it's a pretty a chorus of bright yellow
shade I really wanted to stick with like
yellow and golden tones hence why I was
using a lot of like obviously yellow and
oranges to create that golden look and
this shadow is literally perfect so I'm
just using that on a slightly smaller
fluffier brush to further define the
crease and then this is just gonna be
the darkest shade that we use again from
that color pop low-key eye shadow
palette on us really it's small to find
a fluffy brush just placing that in the
crease we are kind of gonna create a
small cut crease but nothing too
dramatic or anything it's gonna be
really really soft so I am going back in
with the brush that we used before just
to buff that out
to carve out the crease I'm using this
gorgeous cream eyeshadow from Maybelline
is in the color 24 karat gold and I'm
just placing this all over the lid and
I'm just using it like I said to tidy up
my lid and almost create like a really
soft cut crease look and I'm just
setting in place taking it this gold
eyeshadow from the 24-karat Maybelline
eyeshadow palette I think it's like 24
karat nude eyeshadow palette from
Maybelline but yeah I'm just using a
flat brush and basically it's setting
that cream eyeshadow in place then I
didn't have a yellow glitter so I'm
mixing these two together this is the
violet Voss glitter in a Goldy mix with
the Beauty bakery Sprinkles in bronze if
either a well if any of you guys know
like a bright yellow glitter definitely
comment down below and let me know cuz
I'm really in the market for one but
then just going back in it with that
small definer brush to tidy up the
crease and define it a little bit more
and then just making sure everything is
really blended together by using that
fluffy brush that had the NYX eye shadow
on it previously then I'm just taking a
makeup wipe to it clean up underneath
and get rid of all the glitter that fell
down and create a wing and then using my
NYC a black liquid liner to create a
black winged oh my god apparently this
is being it discontinued I know that
they sell it on Amazon I've never seen
it in Boots or super drug anymore so
definitely it stock up on Amazon while
you can and then for lashes i'm using
the eyler won 2-6 for like a spikey
dramatic look obviously the glue is just
trying onto the skin I'm been loving it
using this L'Oreal oil and I just blend
it in with a Beauty Blender I think it's
made my skin look a lot healthier and it
has made it a lot more clear underneath
my makeup so been really loving that at
the moment and then using the NYX first
base primer spray as my primer and going
back in with the Beauty Blender again
just to make sure it's all pressed in
place and for foundation I'm going to
use the Anastasia Beverly Hills
Foundation stick in warm tan I haven't
used this in ages and I found it blended
so so so much better into my skin as I'd
put the oil down first so that's a tip
for you if you have used this before and
found it a bit dry coz I know I had
previously that oil underneath literally
and made it look ten times better than
it had it previously so going back in
with that NARS concealer again this is
in the shade canal
tink and it's one of their newer shades
and interests at placing this underneath
my eyes obviously and other places I
want to highlight and using the Sigma 3d
HD sponge
I'm loving this one at the moment it's a
lot more firmer than a Beauty Blender
again I think I said this before I'm not
sure if it's out yet but when it does
come out definitely recommend trying it
it's totally different to any other
sponges that I've tried for powder I'm
not using Laura Mercier today I'm using
this one from Bobbi Brown is the sheer
loose powder in pale yellow I heard
makeup by Ariel talked about this on a
video before and he literally raved
about it
him and makeup by Samuel so I wanted to
try it out and test it and so far I've
been really loving it so maybe it will
replace the Laura but now back to the
eyes I'm gonna take that NYX eyeshadow
cuz I really wanted to emphasize on the
whole yellow of this look so I'm just
running that underneath my eye and then
using this nude makeup geek eyeliner
just in my waterline to really open it
up and brighten and then I just applied
a bottom lash mascara to finish off the
eyes back onto the skin I am at taking
this makeup forever bronzer is their
profusion bronzer I think it isn't it 20
M and I am just lightly dusting this all
over my face to warm it up but then I'm
just gonna add a little bit of a contour
using this shade here from the tour just
ProGlide palette and I'm just using a
small definer brush to really kind of
chisel out my cheekbones you could see
the difference there and the difference
it makes and then I'm using this L'Oreal
blush is in soft sand I think just look
how gorgeous it is I wore to the L'Oreal
event last night and I literally it fell
in love with it so I've been really
loving that and then it mixing these two
shades here again from the tardis globe
palette and just place them that on the
tops of my cheekbones and then down the
bridge of my nose and my Cupid's bow
just all the places that I like to bring
forward and then for my lips I'm at
taking this more Fiat liquid lipstick in
the shade they la I've been obsessed the
formula of this and the shade and I
thought it really complemented the
eyeshadows
now on to the hair my hair was kind of
already straight cuz I'd straightened it
the day before but I always loved to
spray it with this conditioning spray
from Bellamy and then just brush it all
through my hair to make sure that it's
all kind of keeping condition because my
hair's blonde and so dry and damaged so
as much conditioning as possible but
then I always straighten at these bits
these are the little wispy bits that are
so so so annoying
so I go over them a few at times with my
straightness just to make sure that
they're really really really really
straight because when it rains or
anything it's always these bits that
like curl up and it's really annoying
and then I run my straight is just over
my whole hair and this is a really
really crucial bit a hair oil I think
this one's from Bellamy as well I
literally run it through the little bits
on the front to make sure they all stick
down and also through the ends of my
hair to make sure that they're all silky
smooth so you can totally see the
difference but yeah just running my
straighteners through and repeating the
process on the other side that's all
there is to it I definitely just make
sure to get underneath the hair and
apply a hair oil to the front bit and
the ends to make sure it all looks
healthy but that is the finished look so
this is the finished makeup and hair
look I really hope you guys liked it
those of you that said you've been
loving my straight hair at the moment so
I kind of wanted to include that and
show you the tips I do to keep my hair
strokes I know sometimes doesn't stay
straight if you've got naturally frizzy
hair and yeah and I wanted to do
something a little bit different with
color in terms of makeup so I really
hope you guys enjoyed
