it's a little bit of a different video
for me today I'm doing another beauty
hacks video and this time it is some of
my summer Beauty must know hacks so if
you suffer some of the same issues as me
on holiday I really hope you find this
video helpful and you learn something
new make sure to give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't
already for more beauty hat videos and
obviously for my other tutorials as well
yeah let's go ahead and get on with the
video look beauty hack number one if you
manage to get sunburned on holiday
freeze aloe vera gel in an ice cube tray
and use it to treat your burns and help
soothe the pain Beauty hack number two
applied deodorant to the back of your
neck before blow-drying your hair to
avoid any sweating on to number three if
you're like me and apply a fake tan on
holiday fix any self-tanner mistakes
with baking soda and mix it with water
and an exfoliating mitt so you can
always start fresh on to number four
shave with baby oil to keep your skin
really really soft and avoid any skin
irritation even at the beach my fifth
beauty hat is hair my hair and humidity
is a low go so tame your baby hairs by
spraying a toothbrush with hairspray and
just using it to smooth stray hairs back
into place
number six sand always manages to get
everywhere on holiday so use baby powder
to remove sand after date of the beach
it absorbs sweat and saltwater makes it
so much easier to wipe away number seven
plasters on blisters is not pretty so
keep them away by putting Theoden on
your ankles and your toes number eight
being on a holiday always seems to mean
constant shaving so mix lemon sugar and
water for a natural concoction that
slows hair growth and the last one
finally use dry shampoo at night and it
absorbs any excess oil and sweats by the
morning
there you have it they are my summer
Beauty hack muss no tricks
make going on holiday and
in the heat and humidity and all the
issues that come along with sometimes
being on holiday are not easy for myself
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video like I said give this video a
thumbs up if you did so I guys know that
you like these type of videos and I can
come up with some other ones yeah thank
you so much for watching and until next
time I'll see you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
