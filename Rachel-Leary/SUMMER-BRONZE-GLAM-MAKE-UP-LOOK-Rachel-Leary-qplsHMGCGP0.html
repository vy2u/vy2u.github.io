today they wanted to film a more
regardful a coverage glam look if that
makes sense
I've been a lots of summer looks that
I've done recently I've left my most
recent one that linked down below I kind
of objects in a more minimal look for
the zip ties a lot of people don't like
to wear a lot of makeup when it's really
hot but if you like me and you're
willing to buy the bullet this is a
full-coverage a bronzy glam looks using
those of the newest you a student
collection products so this highlighter
pen is seeing this kind of lip stopper
and what's on my eyes in all from the
news you a collection so I literally put
it in the mail today from Michael cutie
and I was desperate to try it out so I
definitely wanted to create it it's you
guys don't really hope you guys like it
sorry for the kind of lack of videos
this week and omission my schedule of
video from the UK or anywhere in the
world should have seen what's happened
recently in Manchester and I feel that
that really affected a lot a lot a lot
of people I personally felt very
affected by it just because of the age
range of the audience is a lot of the
adriennes that you guys watch and
actually I know quite a lot of people
that watch me were there so I just felt
very not myself and I didn't want to
have to fake it on camera for you guys
so I hope you can appreciate that and
just enjoy this video so yeah definitely
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
do enjoy and subscribe if you haven't
already let me know if you want me to do
any other looks at any of the products
that I mentioned or any future video
requests leave them in the comments down
below I'd love to read them if you're
new like I said make sure to subscribe
and hit that notification bell and
without further ado let's go on with the
tutorial just ignore the kind of
differences because I wasn't actually
sure 100% what I was going to do so I am
just going to go ahead and pour my eye
and for that I'm using the Tarte
concealer in the shade tan at just the
point I wanted to kind of match the
color of like the foundation I'm going
to wear which will be a bit more tan
than my skin I have got six han on at
the moment but that is just kind of like
in development and also we're doing our
eyes fast today and normally I only
really do that when I'm doing a wing but
I thought I try and mix up the technique
I can show you that if you like doing
your eyes kind of first even if you are
doing around iron which is the look like
I've gone for two decades then I just
like to make sure I'm taking my face all
the way up and like down underneath as
well that way you can just blend around
it whenever you're doing your skin
makeup so I'm just going to quickly fill
my eyebrows I'm mixing it up at the
moment I'm going back to an old favorite
I'm using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
that dip brow in a soft brown just for
the tail of my brow and then there's a
brow bar brow definer in the shade
cinnamon spice just do the front because
it's slightly warmer doing the tone of
my brow with the dip brow and then
taking it this brow definer pencil if
it's just a slightly or color you guys
know I prefer to like feather up the
front of my eyebrows and have a bit more
of a natural looking gradient going on
like that and I'm going to take the
concealer that I've time to use which is
the Becca aqua a luminous perfecting and
sealer because I saw Debbie reading
about this and she was doing her makeup
collection video oh my god if you've not
seen that video go to her Channel and
watch it it's literally makeup gold
there's you're saying how much she like
lives by this concealer and I knew I had
it but I didn't think much of it when I
had it so I thought I'd definitely need
to give it another go so I'm just using
that to just brighten up underneath the
brow I'm just going to make sure that
all kind of set in it's nice with powder
so anything that we put on top is going
to blend it super easy I shadow today
I'm going to dip into some old favorite
makeup geek eyeshadow so this is
chickadee I'm just going to use that as
our initial transition color and now
because I can't forget that we're not
going to wipe anything away so I am
still making sure to keep it all very
rounded and a spin but tonight I am off
to do some exciting going off to watch
the screening of the Baywatch movie
we're doing a little bit work towards
that and you'll see very soon why and
then the next one
is coconut also from makeup geek and
just again passing that is only really
gonna be using like three crease colors
or the very warm brown wrong one sorry
if you hate that but it's summer and
summer to me is being warm and brown I'm
gonna go back in with my original brush
as well okay now for the lid color to
dip into something very exciting this is
the new joueur skinny dip ultra foil
shimmer shadows holy moly is basically
just a pallet of lip colors and I'm
going to take the color tan lines I feel
like everyone at since I got this
palette instantly wanted to use the
skinny dip color because it is your
classic like champagne gold which we
know is a lot of people's favorites but
this tan line colors really caught me
it's almost it's more like a greeny
Goldy bronzy color than I saw but then I
am going to add a little like something
extra on the top to make it a bit more
bronzing but I wanted it to mix up I
don't like I just do what everyone else
is doing so I'm just using a flat brush
and this is the matte 242 I love the
democrates or - it's like glitters or
any kind of like foiled pavements
shadows
look how pigmented that is it really
glides on I was so impressed my uses
earlier I was like yeah like a lot of
swatches so pigmented I mean I've kind
of seen the pigmentation from people
that are on that trip they're like
watching the launch and stuff I'm going
to go in with Matt reflex bronze and
again on d2 - no 242 brush I'm just
going to spray it with fix+ and then I'm
going to spring my iris clicks 6 + 2 and
then press it on top of where we place
that
tanlines color cheers for a pop of
glitter and a little bit extra sparkle
and also just slightly warm up the color
these are reflex glitters are so good
because they're not really chunky
uncomfortable they really just add
almost like fairy dust as a little bit
of like okay amazing
I'm not going to dip my brush into a lot
better to show you this is the color
badda-bing it is just a dark brown from
makeup geek and a tiny bit of a gold
Sparkle tip and I really like it for
just deepening up the crease like that I
sent a thing when I had like more
glitter but actually I know higher on my
inner corner fast and so color oh and
the colors of that I'm actually going
back into that skinny dip palette and
taking the color the key which looks
pinky actually comes out as just quite a
nice bit of art is just a lighter
champagne gold you'll see actually not
even like champagne though it just kind
of looks a lot whiter
I feel the colors how they look and not
how they come out on your eye on the
skin just highlight the inner corner
there then yeah thing outside and more
of that reflex bronze there we go why do
I always perfect and now I'm going to
take a little flat shader brush and dip
my brush into that badda-bing color and
literally just press it on the outer
third of our top lashline
just add a little bit of like a sultry
cat eye look but then at some lashes I'm
going to take the Lele lashes in this
style luck then like a winged out super
kind of Sluttery actually really pretty
for like everyday time - so I'm just
going to get them out apply them cuz I
didn't want anything to be too
distracting I think the lid looks too
pretty for that but before that I'm just
going to apply mascara I'm using it the
Fiat colossal Big Shot mascara from
Maybelline always say this I use it is a
save of mine I love how much formula it
deposits on my lashes and the brush it's
just beautiful
yeah now I'm just going to go ahead and
apply those lashes and I'll be back to
show you the eyes is I just put on it
those lashes you can see they're super
like not joyful for everyday but now
because we've taken the concealer down
quite low I feel like we can finish off
doing the eye makeup so I'm going to go
back in it to that Coco bear color
because I want to be quite dark and
sultry and anything because this dreamy
gold color is giving me that kind of
vibe I don't know why so I'm just going
to buff that alone and connect it up and
round like so and then I'm actually
going to get the brush back in to the
tan lines and skin tip color and then
just take that just I'll make the inner
most part of the eye and then just buff
in there like a little bit back with
that pencil brush and then using Mac
PowerSearch I call I'm just going to run
that along my waterline
oh my god sorry that must have looked
really funny I always get really weird
when I'm editing with more Sun and now
I'm just going to apply it but ahem my
eye now I'm going to apply bottom lash
mascara so these are the finished bronzy
I literally that palette so good for the
lid cuz it's so sparkly and so pretty
but now we can move on to the skin maker
bubble okay so to begin I'm just going
to apply my moisturizer which is the
l'oreal hydrogenous cream i saw quite a
few of you by the way I just remember I
staked on my face I feel like I'm about
to watch it all come off gray are
nothing when that happens but don't
forget that you've taken the concealer
down quite low why is one side sounds
redundant but yeah I've literally been
loving this stuff and I keep saying I
saw a few comments saying am I going to
do a YouTube review yet another is your
YouTube review on it but honestly it one
of the nicest feeling
moisturizers and they say and it's been
such a good base for my makeup because
it actually leaves a little bit of
attackers on primer don't say I'm not
calling it a part of it just leaves I
feel like it's a little bit of attack
today I am going to go in with a primer
which is a DM Marc Jacobs like coconut
corner and then I find this at a moment
has been like what a like winning
combinations of that moisturizer the
next primer on top
and I'm going to like a bronzy look
today so I want my glowy products and
this one does these are really pretty
finish on your skin pretty you you okay
I feel like for a lot of my summer looks
recently I've been going quite minimal
on the skin and I thought it you
know some I know I do I can make a grin
and bear it I want full coverage
sometimes in the summer so that's what
I'm going to do today and I'm going to
use the Kat Von D and locket tattoo
foundation I've not used this and will
yep a long time cleaning I'm not use you
this what feels like forever
and I have an event tonight I know it's
really good
isn't that literally like the stays on
the skin so I'm just going to sponge
that into my skin and this one's in the
shade I think medium 57 maybe but I am
like gradually telling as you can see so
hoping this will match up nicely to be
fair this isn't too heavy on the skin if
you use like a sponge with it but it
honestly is like so okay it's feeling
sufficiently luxe in case I'm going to
go in like I said earlier D at Becca
aqua luminous concealer and this is in
the shade fair so I think it's gonna
brighten up underneath my eyes and then
again just blend that in with a booty
blender trying not to like ruin
underneath the eye makeup anything okay
so with the concealer done I'm going to
go ahead and use the Anastasia Beverly
Hills mix contour Curtis to add a little
bit of a cream plant or and you find a
brush thank you
so this is a very cool tone contour it's
not so much of a cream a bronzer
definitely a cream contour color glitzy
one of my maybe my fave one to do so
lovely now I'm actually going to take a
couple of the cover effects can do like
custom jobs which are a really deep
bronze color and just
dab them on and then just use the same
brush to kind of blend down and around
pretty okay same on this side use the
Beauty Blender pretty okay now I feel
like that all creams I will use so I'm
going to set everything in place with my
best friend Laura so ever you want to
get rid of anything like glow the shines
I'm just going to concentrate this and
then use my eye and then just kind of
like brush the excess our words but then
I am going to see it be applying it
underneath here so now that will same
place I'm going to enhance my contour
with one of my favorite bronzers for
like this time of year this was a brush
this is the buxom bronzer in Tahiti it
has such a gorgeous Goldy go right
through it but like I said also I love
it for contouring I feel like it's a
perfect mix between a cool tone and it
being quite warm term I'm just going to
be applying that probably around okay
it's a brush I'm dipping into a new
product identities on camera yet it is
one of the Anastasia Beverly Hills at
brush trios and this one is in the shade
peaches out I'm going to kind of dip my
brush in the to end once or more orangie
and in this light you like a pink one I
love a peachy blush so when I saw that
one it was like an instant phase okay
finally onto the highlight all began
from the issue a skinny dip collection I
did get them both
I did get tan lines and skinny dip
skinny dip it's more like your champagne
kind of color and then talent is more
like you're wrong via one and you guys
know I'd love a shimmery bronzer so I'm
going to go ahead and just dust pan
lines lightly all over my skin if you
like that's given such a word just glow
I'm obsessed okay now it's time to try
skin you do this so I'm going to go
ahead and take
my Mac to g4 that I love to you for
highlighting and just practical - oh my
god oh my god quick let me go out go out
and buy like seven I don't know if this
collection be limited edition but oh
obsessed I didn't even think that was
going to be my favorite product after
standard collection but I think you
might but this was always going to be
the fav but I'm just going to go ahead
and line my lips and this is the Natasha
Danone a lip pencil and me nude so it's
a really nice warm nude color honestly
such a great color if you like to over
line your lips and then I'm going to go
ahead and fill in my lips with the
anastasia beverly hills liquid lipstick
in stripped again a lot more of a warmer
nude and now i'm going to go ahead and
apply what i thought giving my favorite
products the new lip topper in sand
repair and i really hope this is
everything i think is going to because
i'm so excited for this is literally a
light nude glittery lip topper so
realistically I'm excited I can't stop
okay okay I'll stop now but oh my god I
love it I'm just going to everything in
shades of mine illuminating cover
effects spray and that is the finished
look so this is the finished makeup look
I actually love how it came out is a
little bit difference me as like a
different kind of bronze I hope you guys
