as you can see by a little video down
here and obviously by the thumbnail
today we are going to creating a summer
glam look it's like yellow and red vibes
going on and I don't know why I think of
summer you might be like a Baywatch I
think of those kind of colors but I
doesn't you wanted to do something
colorful and with summer kind of coming
to an end here in the UK and the weather
getting crap I think I just wanted to
get one more summer glam looking and
what better way to do it then use kind
of all of my favorite brands from the
drugstore my favorite kind of products
by them so I really hope you guys enjoy
that let me know you just want to see a
full face of favorite products in
general just remind any kind of brand so
I would love to do that for you yes if
you like the look of this makeup look or
like go see the thumbnail and you will
know how to achieve it then pinky
watching so to begin I'm going to start
with my brows using one of my favorite
brands this is the NYX micro brow pencil
and I'm using two shades chocolate and
ash brown I use chocolate through the
tail of my brow cuz I need it to be a
slightly darker just because as you can
see I extend my brow just kind of onto
skin running it to be slightly darker so
it looks as the most natural that it can
and then I use the shade ash Brown
through the front of my brow just
because it's slightly lighter and I like
that gradient effect so I just kind of
run the brush through lightly and then
use upward strokes to kind of create
that feathered effect to the front and I
literally love any sort of micro brow
pencil it's literally all I've been
using at the moment and these are some
of my favorites and then I'm going to
use the Loreal brow artist plumper in
the shade light/medium because as you
guys know i literally love a lighter
brow gel through my hair just cuz i feel
like it adds different tones and stuff
just kind of like it looks more natural
with my hair and then using it the
concealer but i'm going to use on my
face which is the maybelline like age
rewind concealer I love this one and
just taking a little brush and using it
to sculpt out underneath my brow and
also using it as my eye primer as well
just because I find concealers do just
an amazing job so I'm just blending that
all over my lid and then it's setting it
in place again with the same at powder
that I'm going to be using on my face
and this is the Rimmel inste matte
translucent powder I literally love the
powders from Rimmel under the eyes I'm
going to be taking just a couple of
shades from NYX these are some of their
nude matte eyeshadows and this is a
gorgeous yellow one I think
it's called a cougar and I'm just
buffing this back and forth and I want
this to be quite a prominent color
because we are going to cut the crease
so you can be quite messy with this on
the lid and then I'm going to take this
shade I think this one's called a loo or
something but I've definitely left all
the names of them at down below and I'm
just busing that back and forth as well
definitely making sure to go from inner
to outer corner because like I said we
are going to be cutting up the crease I
want the colors to be really prominent
and bright and then just going back in
with the fluffy brush that I used
previously it to blend them together
then taking the concealer that I use
obviously to carve out my brow and I'm
going to be doing my space I'm using
this to carve out my crease so just
using a a small concealer brush I am
just keeping my eye open and looking
down into a mirror and just kind of
cutting out and mapping out a brand new
crease because I'm going to be using
quite a light shade on the lid and I'm
going to be using some glitter in the
crease as well so I want it to be a
super defined so the color on the lid
I'm going to be using is a next pigment
and I think this is called brighten up
again I'm not 100% sure I've left the
name of it down below it's basically
like a shade of white but it has like a
reflex of gold and yellow so I put this
totally tied in with the crease colors
that we are using and it's not nothing
it to a drastic either so quite a pale
colour which I really really love and
then cuz I'm a little bit of a
perfectionist I feel like I kind of
losing the orange color so I just took
it on a a pencil brush and just defined
the crease a little bit more now I love
this is like a new love for me this is
like a collection glitter liner in the
shade funk
it literally reminds me of the Urban
Decay Midnight Cowboy glitter liner that
like everyone uses to create joy to cut
creases and I feel like this is
literally a fraction of the price so
that's the link and the name of this
down below do you guys want to get your
hands on it so I'm just using that to
kind of trace the line of the crease so
it's like a glitter cut crease and now
I'm just wiping away any of the excess
so we've got a baseline for our winged
liner but first of all I'm just going to
be highlighting my inner corner using a
shade from the sleep tears purchase kiss
highlighting palette which you guys know
is my absolute fave and we're going to
be using that on the face - and for
winged liner I'm taking an old favorite
this is the NYC a liquid liner in black
not hundred percent sure you can get
this anymore but I've left the Amazon
link to it down below then I'm just
applying a light coat of mascara this is
the Maybelline Big Shot mascara you
nice freakin obsessed distance Cara but
it's me I'm going to be applying lashes
and even some of my all-time favorites
and some of your all-time favorites by
the sounds bit because some of you guys
to tweet me saying you've literally
discovered these because of me and these
are the pinky goat lashes in our but now
onto the skin I am taking it via L'Oreal
extraordinary facial oil I love a good
facial oil on the skin before skin prep
and this one's my favorite from L'Oreal
and for primer I'm taking it the Nivea
post shave balm as you can see I've
literally nearly run out of it so I'm
just applying that on my face with my
Real Techniques multitask brush I can
never remember the name of this brush
but this is also from the drugstore in
terms of brushes and for foundations
could you guess it it is be a Maybelline
Max and caller fit me foundation in the
shade to to a I've left all the shades
of everything it's down below as well by
the way and I'm just blending that in
using a damp sponge I feel like this is
the best way to apply foundation if you
don't want to apply too much and like I
said for concealer I'm using the
Maybelline age rewind concealer in the
shade light some people say that they
really hate the applicator for this but
I actually really love it and I'm just
applying that underneath my eyes and
like in my t-zone and just on my chin
just the center of my face basically all
the places that I want to brighten it up
and just using it be a tapered side of
the sponge to do so but then when it
comes to blending up my forehead in my
chin I do like to use the side but I use
my foundation on just cuz I feel like it
blends everything together now this is
also a new of like found love this isn't
the array or do contour stick in the say
shade dark and just gonna be applying
that on all the places that I want to
contour and warm up so obviously my
cheekbones my forehead my chin area all
that kind of stuff I just feel like this
is such a nice color it's not too orange
but it's not too cool in tone but it
looks muddy I feel like it's such a nice
color and the formula of these blend out
so so so easily and I feel like they're
the cheaper alternatives and the Kim
Kardashian at contour stick so
definitely make sure to check them out
if you haven't and I'm just going to set
my face with the powder that we used
earlier again this is the Rimmel insert
matte translucent powder and just
applying that everywhere and mainly
concentrating it underneath my eyes but
then just dusting it everywhere to make
sure it's all set in place and a full
bronzer I literally love the NYX no
filter powder in the shade at golden is
meant to be a facial powder so it's not
even meant to be a bronzer it has such a
natural color like warm color that I
love it as a bronzer it reminds me of
c-max mineralized skinfinish is as well
and you guys know I love a shimmery
bronzer and this is the Rimmel radiance
brick I think and I'm just using a big
brush to just dust that all over my face
to warm it up and this is one of my
all-time favorite blushes this is from
sleek and it is in the shade rose gold
it really reminds me of the NARS blush I
think it might be in orgasm and every I
keep saying as you guys know that you
guys noticed by now but literally where
my favorite highlighters is via sleek
highlighting palettes and this one is in
the shade Cleopatra's case I'm using
focus of powder shades the darker one
first and then to make it extra and pop
I'm taking the lighter shade on the top
now to finish off the eyes I'm taking
another next shadow but this is one of
their prismatic shadows in the shade
gilded it's such a gorgeous vibrant
yellow I Rachel II saw it and felt
really inspired about this whole look
just because of this eye shadow but then
going back in with that matte shade that
we used earlier just to buff it out
underneath and really it smoked out and
like enhance the color I then just
applied up bottom lash mascara and these
are be finished eyes moving on to the
lips I felt like doing it something
bright because I always do a nude and
recently got my hands on these new
Maybelline hot vivid lacquers they do
it's so so so many shades obviously the
nude ones are my favorite but this red
also just called my name this is in the
shade it's so hot and I just felt like
it tied everything together and really
kind of finished this summer glam look
so this would be a finished makeup look
