as you guys know or if you don't know I
did tweet about it the other day if you
don't put my twitter is at Rach
underscore Larry I'm going on holiday on
Monday and plastic me left everything to
the last minute so I just a bunch of
online holiday shopping so I thought I
would show you what I've got to kind of
maybe inspire shopping for your holiday
or just generally clothing wise for the
rest of the summer I've linked
everything down below so this isn't
gonna be a try on haul just because
realistically I'm going on holiday on
Monday so I'm kind of in the midst of
scrubbing off all my tan so the body is
not on fleek but I will show you
everything to the best that I can and
like I said I've linked everything down
below so you can see what it looks like
on the models and stuff like that yeah
let's go ahead and jump right into it
there's a few brands in here that not
tried before
and this one I had so yeah okay so first
of all I did a big mass order from
misguided so this is the first thing
that I got it is a black play suit it
has kind of kimono sleeves like this and
I don't know if you can see cuz it's
like a black on black but let me just go
to the label it dips down into a V right
here so it's like a plunge place because
you guys know I'm talking about that
plunge yeah I have also done a bit of an
order from boohoo but yeah so I can't
tree that but you will see how I star
this I'm short on Instagram and stuff I
ordered like a big thick chunky gold
belt to go with it yeah I just thought
it's really kind of like a loose fitting
I'll do kind of a lego you can kind of
see the plunge bit more there it's
really like a loose fitting it's a
really nice material as well so so so
flattering I think it would look so much
better with like a gold belt around the
middle or like any kind of but I mean
they're just to kind of like how can tie
you in at the waist a bit more so I
really like this one
I've tried it on as well and it's good
the flattering I also got a swim - I
never know about white swimsuits cuz
wanted to get like wet like from like
the sea and the pool and that you can
see this but this one has like neither
and stuff so that is this one it cut is
a whole snake it toys on the top and
scoops around the bat and does anyone
because I'm going to Marbella it's quite
ghulam so I've kind of styled my
swimsuits with accessories and stars so
to go with my swimsuit I obviously got
some slides just slip on when I just go
down by the pool I've been wearing these
around the house as well I'm obsessive
inthere so so so comfortable
such a nice shooter we're just like
casually and round the house but I
nearly ran around the pool so I also
have something else I've got to go with
this kind of white ensemble that I've
got planned but yeah I am a size 6 shoes
as a reference if that helps but I know
misguided under loads other places sell
these and they have so so so many other
colors but I just decided to get weight
then I've got a couple of bags I got
this one again it's still from misguided
it is a bright orange color and has like
gold detailing a little tassel and a
gold chain I wear a lot of black so like
for example that black place ooh I
thought this would add a really nice pop
of color in there and I could do a
matching lip it like Mac lady danger
type color or Anastasia Beverly Hills I
see that kind of color I never really
wear orange like clothing wise but I
thought if I get those kind of coloured
accessories this kind of really makes my
eyes pop so I'm styling all together
hopefully it'll they'll be complementary
to like my skin tone and my features and
stuff and yeah bit different for me but
I really like it
it's a good really nice size as well and
I got one other bag and this is like a
black and this fit is actually more of a
chrome color so it's not silver that in
might be showing up because of the light
is definitely more like a black or like
a dark grey metal so it's a chain
shoulder bag as well like this I've got
this to replace my one from Aldo that I
literally wear all all all the time it's
kind of like a broken and falling apart
and this one's a bit smaller it has more
of like a cropped detail and I thought
this would be perfect to style as like
just like a lightweight bag on holiday
and black kind of goes with everything
as well so that is all that I got from
misguided
I'm gonna show you what I got from it
sorted only got a couple of things and
one of them is actually from misguided
but from a sauce so I ordered this beach
cover-up but before I can't I'll just
explain basically in Marbella there is a
club called Ocean Beach and it's
basically where it's like a pool bar
club type thing but you dress really
glam so you would go there wearing like
heels and a full face of makeup in like
your swimsuit stuff like that and
everyone wears really kind of ghulam
swimwear that makes sense so I'll show
you the swimming costume but I got to go
with this but yeah I've got this beach
cover-up is like a personal turquoise
color and it's really long yeah it's got
like splits all up it so like your legs
come through kind of as you walk it is
so flattering on I can't even tell you
and I love this color on with a tan I
know they did it in white they were out
of stock of it otherwise I would have
got the white but luckily this whimsy
that I'll show you that I'm gonna wear
has this kind of color on it so I
thought I will tie it together with this
yeah this is from ASOS and I will have
it linked down below it's got a really
nice plunging V as well and then I've
got these pair of shoes these are
actually from misguided but I got them
from a saw so you could probably get
them off misguided if say that our stock
of your size on ASOS and in CDs on
misguided I've I probably would have
just ordered them from there but they
are a nude strappy sandal and I got
these to wear Ocean Beach and also just
like generally anyway normally for me I
cannot walk in heels my feet just end up
hurting I obviously I wear them all the
time but if I'm going to be at like a
beat pool bar Club type thing I really
wanted a thick sturdy here that I would
be able to walk in that still kind of
looked glam but then also like a sandal
at the same time so I'm so excited to
wear these they are actually so much
nice and I thought they were going to be
on the website they didn't look as nice
as in the color and the quality and
stuff but I am obsessed with these
they've got gold detailing on them and
I'm sure I'll be posting these on
Instagram and showing you like my full
pool glam outfit of the day but yes that
is all that I got from ASOS now on to
more of like an American website I'm
if you guys follow and reason and stuff
like that you might have heard of hot
Miami styles they basically contacted me
and asked if I would like to kind of
like show up on their website because
I'm gonna film a lookbook while I'm out
there using all that stuff it's not
gonna be sponsoring thing I just said
like I'm going on holiday like that
would be awesome
so yeah this I kind of ordered stuff
based on like I said going on summer
vacation obviously I'm going on like
kind of like a party holiday as well so
this and coming stuff thrown in there so
yeah I will show you so this is the
swimsuit I was talking about to go with
the sandals that I've just showed you
and that beach cover-up as you can see
it has like so many colors in it I can't
wait till I pick one of these colors to
put on my lips to go with it as well and
basically it's like a multi-way
swimsuits you can wear it a bunch of
ways essentially tie it around your neck
I think like that and then these things
are long enough to then drop down behind
and then come tie around your front and
then background and that's when you
would tie it background I'm so excited
to wear this I've already tried it on
and it is so flattering as well because
when it ties on the front you can really
like suck yourself in and yeah like I
said I thinked it down below and you
will see it definitely in the liquid I
plan to film on holiday too then I've
got this beach cover-up to go with my
white pool out there this is like animal
style print it's like the zebra style so
so flattering again even though it's
like a cover up your thing you know cuz
I'm gonna be flattering but it just is
it is so nice it's like shit as well so
you can see whatever you're kind of up
wearing underneath and yeah I plan to
wear that with their white swimsuit and
the white slides and I think it's just
good Fanning with the tan as well why
always looks good with the town on
anyone it's a really lightweight
material as well but you'll see how I
style that the next thing I got was a
bodysuit but this one is it she just
plain baby pink I have a lot of patent
shorts that have kind of Pink's on and
like florals so I never know what to
wear so I got this to kind of go with
that for more like a daytime then I also
got some like bandage skirts and stuff
that I thought would look really nice
just if you need something plain to go
on top I love the fit of body suits and
this is what just
always be like wearing like a plain pink
strappy top I'm obsessed with pastel
pink at the moment I think with blonde
hair I can and stuff it just looks
really like yes I got this and it's kind
of a high-rise one as well so again
super flattering on like your hips and
stuff so yeah like I just mentioned I
got kind of those body suits and I'll
see I have other body suits to go it's
like bandage skirts and stuff this kind
of more like a nighttime holiday outfit
like clubbing or like going going for
drinks or something and this is the kind
of like nude bandaged skirt I do have
quite a few nude ones but this one's an
arched waistline and that really
intrigued me tried it on oh my god so
much more flattering like it makes you
look like you've got more of a big booty
and this kind of hugs you everywhere
that you want it to and it's a really
nice color as well and the kind of dips
in it like in that bandaged pattern draw
your attention inward so again making
you appear like slimmer and stuff so
yeah I am obsessed with this and it
looks so nice on and hope to where you
want it to and it has a zip up back as
well kind of reminds me of this stuff
that you get from like my bandage dress
and yeah oh my god I'm so excited to
wear this and like put this on and show
you in like the look but when I do it
and then obviously when my and when and
post instagrams it basically just so
excited to wear this on holiday okay so
definitely click the link down below if
you want to see what this looks like on
cuz mailing up is definitely not going
to do it justice so look at what the
models wearing but basically a cross
front maxi dress it has like tie in tied
like a tied belt type thing it comes
with like pants sewed in which suck you
in and kind of goes up your bum a bit so
your butt looks awesome as well and then
it just like is this a glam glamazon
that like wait hold on I mean I can lift
ass so yeah it comes with 50 shorts
inside and then this material that flows
down it's just so flowy I can't wait to
wear like that thick metal chunky belt I
was talking to you about and also I've
already like a metal brawler as well
because I don't really want to wear
wrong with this I think it's just like
something dainty underneath so I'm gonna
style this with golds and stuff maybe
like with my orange bar because this is
all black like I'm just so so so excited
where this is like one of the things I
thought like I can't wait to start this
and show you guys on Instagram and in
the look like and it's so flattering as
well you'd think you'd get quite hawks
it's a lot of fabric but it's so
lightweight and the long sleeves are
chiffon as well so you won't get too hot
but this is definitely more for those
like summer nights and like evenings
like going out for dinner something a
bit more sophisticated so I've
absolutely obsessed this and I can't
wait to kind of like put it on and show
you if only my tan was good now the next
thing I got was a little romper place
ooh and I think this is so cute I kind
of got this to go with the bag I think
maybe the black one or I might be able
to get with orange number that might
just be a bit too much color it's like
an off-the-shoulder one so you just kind
of pop your pop your arms do like those
holes type things so it's like that
Bardot Bardot style and the white frills
are so cute and it's a short like a
shorts one and I think the color is so
pretty it's got like black and gray on
it too I thought that was kind of a
perfect but you could go out in this and
like if you wore heels you definitely be
able to start it up or just effect
sandals everyday like to throw on over
the top of like your bikini when your
swimsuit I think I'm gonna get like a
lot of wear out of this I love this kind
of style place you as well I think it's
really flattering I think this looks so
and I see you've got dark hair as well
and a bit the tan actually I think it'll
look really nice like my sister and
she's really fair and has like
strawberry blonde hair so I think this
is gonna look pretty nice on anyone so
you guys have kind of already has seen
this on my Instagram but it is essential
it is a neon pink convertible like
halter playsuit so again like the
swimsuit that I showed you they kind of
let you go free really with it
haha basically you kind of put it on
like you would a normal play suit and
then you can tie it kind of comes down
over your shoulders and then you wrap it
round the back and then tie it on the
front again so just kind of like the
swimsuit but I think on the website they
show you other ways of how you can do it
as well I definitely
so I really like this again a super
flattering fit I'm obsessed with this
one and this color this would look
absolutely stunning if you've got green
eyes I think it would just make your
eyes pop like out your skull I've got
this and it's a really lightweight
fabric as well so I think it's gonna be
really good in here and then the last
thing I got is definitely more of like
the nighttime outfit type thing this is
like a nude caged bandage dress like
this so all of this is like mesh so it
is see-through but it does come with
Vantage briefs to wear underneath but
they don't give you a top so I would
recommend wearing like a nude brawler or
like a bra with it but these like really
help to suck you in and then yeah it's
like a long-sleeved noon and each cage
dress essentially and I quite like those
dresses where you have to wear some
antony's I think they're really
flattering and I got a nude one cuz I
thought it would be nice to go with my
new shoes and I could start it was like
a bright v or a bright lip maybe like a
red lip or something I'm sure you'll see
how I started in the lookbook and on
Instagram but yeah so I really liked
this one I thought it was something
slightly different a bit more outrageous
super stretchy too so that is all I got
from hot Miami styles and they have two
more things to show you and they are
from a company called dancing leopard
both quite simple things I found these
through Sarah Ashcroft's you've got a
playsuit from them so I check out the
website and I really like to and they're
started this is um again
a playsuit it is there I go place it in
a blush paint
it's a Cabrini's like a loose-fitting
one so it's really like shabby chic when
you wear it definitely recommend wearing
it was like a nice belt or like body
chains because it's really loose fitting
so you definitely be able to see like
the body chains and stuff on you yeah
it's like sure it's got a really nice
flowy sleeve and a cross over front
plunge but it's like really kind of
loose-fitting and baggy so I can't wait
to wear this I'm definitely in a way
that was like a nude lip and like my
sand was or I've actually got some past
old pink like this kind of color sandals
as well I know it's so hard for me to
like show it to you but what can you do
and the final thing that I got is again
another Beach cover-up that this one is
black it's to go with my black sandals
that
everyone's got black flip-flops black
sandals and my black swimsuit I want on
my last holiday view saw that on
Instagram you know the one yeah and this
one is a lot longer so it's definitely
more of like a kimono type thing so this
one comes down to kind of just past my
knees and it's more of a short sleeve
one it's like short thick short thick
sleeves yeah so this one's really
lightweight and I thought this was
actually when I got it the materials a
lot more kind of daytime wearable so I
think I could probably wear this out
tonight over the top of me if I didn't
want to work a proper jacket but wanted
to feel a bit more covered up and
reserved this is again from dancing
leopard and I've lived it linked down
below so that is it for my summer
