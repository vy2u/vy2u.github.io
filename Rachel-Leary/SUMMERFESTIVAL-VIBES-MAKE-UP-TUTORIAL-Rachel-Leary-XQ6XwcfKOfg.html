gallery hey guys welcome back to my
channel so literally like all of you
basically asked me to recreate the
makeup that I've been posting on
Instagram recently and that was reached
in my previous video and that's the link
to the previous video it down below if
you're interested but I was feeling
really inspired by summer and kind of
tropical vibes so I went with like a
bright pink in it and kind of
coordinating eyes with a glitter half
cut crease type thing
radio programs like summer and the
festival season are coming up so that's
the kind of look I was going for fuse
the fact that I'm in a hoodie right now
I don't want to wear exactly the same
thing that was wrong in the last video
and I'm actually not feeling too great
so you'll have to excuse me if that kind
of translates across the video I'm also
switching up a couple of the products
because I'm a lot paler than I was in
that video so I just had to switch out
the foundation and I used a different
highlighting palette and does it still
created the exact same effect that I
just want to mix up the products I'm
using them a lot recently yeah I read it
you guys enjoy this tutorial definitely
make sure to give a thumbs up if you do
and go ahead and get started to begin
I'm going to use my one of my favorite
skincare products at the moment this is
the hero project glow drops I just do a
couple of drops on either side of my
face and then blend it in with a sponge
my skin is feeling it's so dry at the
moment so using a Beauty oil intoning
foundation has literally been a
lifesaver for me and then it's a
foundation for foundation for primer I'm
going to be using it via two faiths
hangover primer and just buffing that in
with a brush this is again really
hydrating and nourishing on my skin
which is why it is my favorite it she
loved primers that really act like a wet
feel and I can feel really hydrating my
skin from underneath so I switched out
the foundation to one slightly lighter
even though I know this will still be a
quite tan for me but it's like one of
the lightest ones I have I'm just going
to make sure I blend it down this is the
Tarte
rainforest at the C foundation
absolutely stunning finishing the skin
is like satin it's like a light to
medium but coverage you can build it up
as you can see and then I'm going to use
the heart-shaped cake concealer in the
shade light/medium just underneath my
eyes to add a bit more coverage and to
help brighten up
NEADS I've been loving tarp Foundation
and concealer at the moment together
they work so nicely this one is
obviously of a different range so it's a
lot more full coverage but the
foundation is so lightweight and perfect
every day so if you've not tried it
before and you're in the market for like
a dewy and lightweight foundation I
definitely recommend checking that one
out and then going to go ahead and set
everything with powder and then go in
with a bronzer this is the physician
formula butter bronzer and it smells I
keep saying this mine smells kind of
funky but it is meant to smell like
coconut and stuff and it's quite like a
mix between a warm and a cool tone
bronzer so I really like it I do use it
to contour with slightly as well and
it's a blusher I'm at taking the
knockout face palette from colour-pop
which was part of their next two range
and I'm just going to apply it the
blusher and then I'm also going to apply
the highlighter with a big fluffy brush
but I don't really use this for like a
really intense highlight more just an
all-over glow but for highlight I'm
going to use it as a base this is B I
think this is the sunlight cover effects
enhancing drops I'm just going to apply
that with a duo fiber brush and then
press it in it with my fingers to blend
it in you could just leave it there but
I am going to go over with a powder
highlight to really intensify it but I
do find using a cream is a really good
base and these cover effects drops are
stunning they do loads of different
colors for highlighter I for highlighter
you look good for highlighter I'm going
to use the hewed of beauty 3d
highlighting palette as you can see
super intense and it has a really light
golden shade which is exactly what I
wanted and I'm just going to dust that
literally everywhere because I wants to
be been in then I'm going to go ahead
and do my brows and then using it the
color pop eyeshadows I've left the names
of them it down below I'm just taking
this warm brown shade and just really
lightly buffing that in I tried to pick
up as little as possible on my brush
because these higher shadows are intense
and then I'm going in with this really a
gorgeous peachy pink shades it's super
super bright again try not to pick up
too much but this is the color I kind of
wanted to be most intense so I'm just
taking it back and forth across my eye
and loads across my lid and then going
back in with the original fluffy brush
just to make sure it is all blended out
together and then just going back in and
adding bits where I feel like I needed
to then I'm going to sculpt out my lid
to create that half cut crease look and
to clean up the lid so I'm just using it
the studio finish concealer from mac to
do that as you can see and then I'm
going to go back in
actually not I'm taking this matte shade
I think this one's called Firefly
that'll fit there anyone I can remember
basically just to set the concealer in
play so obviously it doesn't crease or
transfer and then I'm going back in with
that initial pink shade just to diffuse
the cream into the crease colors as you
can see just kind of going back and
forth motions to create the perfect
gradient and then go back in with the
fluffy brush not picking up any
additional products just to kind of use
a razor type thing but then this is the
darkest color I'm going to use is a
really gorgeous intense fuchsia shade
I'm just concentrating that on the
furthest part of the eye and then going
back in with my previous brushes to
blend everything together then I'm going
to use the heavy metal eyeliner in
Midnight Cowboy
this is literally a must I feel like
everyone uses this when it comes to glue
to cut creases is such a gorgeous gold
like glitter and it makes doing it this
so much easier because it's super easy
to apply and just kind of applying it
halfway across and you can have the
intensity and the thickness as big as
you want then I'm highlighting my inner
corner and brow bone and to finish off
the eyes I'm running that pink shade
underneath it was the second one not the
darkest one like the kind of peachy a
pink one and then I am buffing it out
with the initial a brown shade that we
use they're basically just repeating
what we did on the top on the bottom
then I'm going to go ahead and apply it
mascara and these lashes are killer
they are the are were ones from pinky
great lashes I am obsessed I'm pretty
sure their range is on three for two at
Superdrug right now so definitely make
sure to check them out but that is the
eyes finished now onto the lips I'm it
taking the makeup forever
acrylic lip in the shade at 202 achieve
the most gorgeous intense fuchsia shade
and they go on quite kind of satiny but
then they dry to a matte finish so I
thought that was part C perfect for this
look so this is the in finish makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial I know I posted about it loads
before but I definitely wanted to get a
tutorial and show you step by step for
