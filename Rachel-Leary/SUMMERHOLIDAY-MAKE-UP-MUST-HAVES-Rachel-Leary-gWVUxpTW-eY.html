say as it's a Sunday I thought that I
would do have bit more of a relaxed in
chatty video and switches summit coming
up I thought I would kind of do a must
have summer makeup item type video so
you're going on a holiday or something
like that and you're thinking of what
kind of makeup tips to bring this is
basically just like a video sort of
products I literally and in love with
that I would definitely be bringing on
with my holiday I left links to
everything down below so you're
interested in anything then definitely
check them out and leave it in the
comments down below your holiday makeup
must have as well don't you give this
video a thumbs up and subscribe for more
videos
but without further adieu should I show
you what my summer makeup musters off
okay so to begin I'm going to start with
kind of body and skin this makeup type
products so the first thing I'm going to
show you is basically for your body and
it is a body oil this is the cocoa brown
and golden goddess of body oil this
literally gives you such a cool just
kind of golden shimmer I love to apply
it kind of down on my legs is such a
like a glittery products if you want to
look kind of more of a glittery golden
glowing type things
definitely I recommend this it's so good
and I love to just kind of apply with a
mitt just kind of over like your natural
turn over your mean you face Han then or
C sakes hand wash off the fake tan and
then apply sometimes it could be your
privates on circular dance a panel
probably gonna end come off but yeah I
literally love this for like my legs and
arms and stuff like that like I said is
more like a glittery tan and more like a
glittery glow I do have amazing books or
more like that bronze glow so stay tuned
for that but yeah in military accessible
moving on it's kind of more like
skincare type products if that makes
sense and I sell it when you're
traveling and stuff you want to make
sure that your skin that stays it's
super hydrates because in hot climates
and tough it gets is so dry and I love a
good travel sized product and this is
mac fix+ MV a travel side version you
can take this on the plane with you they
really like refreshes your makeups
throughout the day and makes you feel
really like
hydrated nothing feels two types if you
do like to wear a lot of makeup on
holiday but hate the way that it might
kind of feel like it's melting off or
it's bit like heavy this is a really
good product to kind of just fix it and
be about make senses
experts not a at setting sprays I'm
going to make your makeup last longer
it's more just like a refreshing makeup
mist and obviously in a trouble size you
can take this on a payment use of it's
super super handy so yeah I literally
and love this as well class this is
really good for like making your
eyeshadows at more intense just like the
full makeup after makeup fix sausage is
one of those must-have products I think
and this one was in the travel size I
thought it would be perfect for this
video next up however is a makeup like
setting spray and as the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray in the chill
versions of different is super like
cooling and refreshing I know for me
when I'm on holiday doing my makeup in a
room that's not necessary like
air-conditioned or like there's a fan
around I which you feel like I'm like
sweltering and I just need to kind of
fix it and plays I went to last and I've
melted off by the time that I've got
thinner my makeup so this is a super
nice one a really refreshing cooling
just makeup setting spray put this in
your fridge maybe and then once you
finish your makeup and spray it on the
seats feeling super cool and rehydrated
and your makeups gonna last hopefully
throughout the whole evening because the
whole that whole like all nighter
setting spray and stuff are so so so
good and pretty sure this one like the
best in the market and that this chill
one just makes perfect sense if you want
to keep hydrated and refreshed but your
makeup to last use this after you finish
doing your celebi open the speaking of
makeup the next one is another skin item
but it's like a type of foundation for
you so a lot of people I'm not including
this because I'll wear full coverage
like anywhere but I mean it's so I'm
just going to the beach or I mean loving
when we're on the beach if you just like
lightweight makeup this will be a really
a nice one for you this is been on
Velvet Matte skin 10 so what this is is
basically like a tinted moisturizer
it definitely has more of a matte finish
to it and I find with things with a
matte finish they tend to last a lot
longer and kind of converts and a lot
more because it hasn't got that kind of
chewy wet formula to it so it's not
naturally going to want to come off your
face it'll make sense and it is a
mortgage skin tint so the formulas is
super lightweight and moisturizing
better yet it is SPF 30 so it has some
skin protection to it that's kind of why
I said to like the B
Deckard if you want to wear like a
little the coverage to the beach but
nothing too heavy and do want to stay
protective this is great for your face
class also when you're on holiday and
you get bit more reppin natural tan you
don't want to cover that up so something
like weight again would be perfect for
that and yes I have to color medium one
at Saint Marie so I'll do like a little
swatch of it for you if you are maybe
anticipating becoming a lot more Brown
you could get this in a couple of shades
darker and it would be your perfect kind
of holiday foundation for towards the
end okay so if you can see the kind of
glow on my chest right now this is
courtesy of like liquid illuminators
they are like my best friend on holiday
I'm not even kidding I love the way that
they look on your skin underneath your
makeup and on your chest and once I've
been literally loving at the moment are
from iconic London I feel like these are
everywhere at the moment and for good
reason too they are so so pigmented the
human loads of colors this is the one
called shine which I actually have on
the top of my cheekbones voices there's
nothing else on top I expect to get
quite like liquid base today so that is
what is only cheeks right here and if
this one is in the shade glow there is
another one called their original one
which is kind of like a hybrid between
them both a lot more of a golden bronze
which is so so so pretty from what I've
seen
yeah I'm literally obsessed with these
you barely need any I'll doing a little
demonstration if you want like on my
chest but this one is in the color like
I said glow and they do it sell it
brushes as well this what I've used to
apply it this is depth buffer brush
literally perfect hand size and perfect
for your body which is why I like it so
these are perfect if you have like a
low-cut dress or something like that and
you just want like a really a bronze
chest area it gives you such a gorgeous
below and it has an undertone to it
that's a really natural glow as well
slightly more of like the runs
appearance and it's nothing it - it
glittery either to me looks super
natural and super healthy just this
brush is really good for doing it fits
really nicely in your hands yeah as you
can see it as you hit the light it just
gives up the gorgeous glow to the skin
yeah I've been at loving indeed at the
moment I actually use this one
underneath my foundation as well they
work so good to see to give you like a
glow from within and I've been using it
different as it's slightly more paler as
you can see on the tops of my cheekbones
so
you're in the market for a new liqueur
illuminated definitely a try them out
I've left the links to them down below
and definitely if you've been in the
market for like a body brush as well and
like a sculpting one as well as perfect
flat cream contouring and all that good
stuff that I've been loving this one it
to buff in and via product as you can
see sticking with the makeup theme I am
going to show you a blusher that I are
always always reach for online holidays
just because it goes with like any
makeup look the finish of it is
incredible I know they do those at
different kind of position is my
personal fave this one is the Abeka
luminous half wali the Becca luminous
blusher in Tiger Lily if you like me and
don't really like a really really pink
cheek or anything that's too noticeable
or yeah blue or green eyes basically
actually any eye college student this
one's just more like the orange base so
would really make your eyes pop if they
were other lighter color this is
honestly one of my favorite blushes ever
it has such a gorgeous glow to it
the orange undertone it means that it's
kind of super peachy and I feel like it
looks really useful as well and the
formula of these is honestly of gorgeous
like a luminous blush or what more could
you want on a summer holiday and they're
super tiny and compact too so I thought
perfect select your makeup bag and
traveling the super super lightweight so
I really really love this product
so sometimes applying a false lashes on
holiday isn't ideal like it's really hot
the last thing when we're doing slumming
around with eyelash glue so I have found
kind of like my perfect combination if I
don't want to wear false eyelashes just
making my eyes look really local full-on
a voluminous and I feel like on holiday
sometimes you don't really need much eye
makeup so just a good mascara and you're
good to go
so the combination I've been at loving
at the moment is it be a Maybelline at
bigshot colossal mascara but after I've
curled my eyelashes with the half
eyelash curler from Mac as you can see
it's not as big as your regular eyelash
curler and this means you can get super
super precise and kind of curl a lot
more of your eyelashes this allows you
to kind of work your way around your
eyes so you can get that full voluminous
effect from them because sometimes with
a big eyelash curler
that's all it is it's just one go dish
you can go as many times as you want and
like I said work your way around the eye
and it doesn't
on a super comment one of my favorites
but brush the formula just everything
I'm in love with it I don't feel like
it's Lex or anything otherwise I
probably would have suggested like a
waterproof mascara for your holiday and
not just like a regular one but this one
I just find it clings to your eyelashes
gives such gorgeous volume you can
really work through I'll have inserted a
clip of what my eyes look like with just
that mascara on so I did want to include
it because I know I wear eyelashes all
the time so just to show you what my
lashes look like with it I really really
love this so if you're in the market for
a new mascara why not go to the
drugstore and just try this one that
font million you almost pick that up at
the airport so again with the makeup
theme I was thinking i shallow palettes
you don't want to be lugging around like
12 custom palettes just because you like
that shades in that one and that one's
from that one you want to bring with
just one part that you can do everything
with I was rummaging through my
collection and I wanted to make sure
that I was picking one that you want
could do everything with so there was a
range of colors to the kind of whole
packaging was quite lightweight and it
three it was colors I actually really
liked and I found this one from zoeva it
is there any plans in there caramel
melange caramel melange eyeshadow
palette you can see it is super super
thin it is so lightweight and the colors
these literally scream holiday to me
I've got them on my eyes right now I've
just got to see like crease cutters and
then a sparkly kind of champagne color
on my lid but like I said there's so
many colors to choose from you've got
some darks to really deepen up and smoke
out a look some really light ones as
well for just an everyday kind of look
honestly I feel that you can do a whole
holiday with this look so that's kind of
why I picked that and there's a range of
coppers and goals and slightly more
pinkier colors so again you can mix up
you're not going to feel like you're
repeating the look all the time and at
this way here is such a gorgeous in a
corner wire is a month so maybe you
prefer shimmery one holiday you should
bring something else but honestly I just
thought this is the perfect palette to
bring on your summer holiday super
lightweight put it in your bag so you
don't
and finally holidays and the perfect
time to experiment with lip colors and
get away with it and feel confident
sassy and just
and so I need to make some alone I mean
sometimes I don't holiday can you really
be asked to do a for gram I mean like I
know I could not everyone can be asked
to do a full of an ayah up and whatever
and sometimes just nothing on the eyes
and a gorgeous bright lip is like a
statement in itself so I have included
kind of some lip options that I would
take on my holiday they're all of quite
a similar color and nature that makes
sense but the first one is this gorgeous
bright coral from NYX this is in the
shade Manila and death soft matte lip
creams they are of a map and if they do
take a little while to dry but they are
so lightweight on the lips
super easy to like reapplied you need to
it's not like something that could
lipstick when they dry and then when you
reapplying it like kind of flakes of it
this is obviously this formula of liquid
lipstick is one of the most comfortable
ones it's usually is a soft matte lip
cream is so soft in the lip and I just
thought this color with at the gorgeous
rich if you just like to Apple white
hair up in a bun hoops no eye makeup
just something like this I think looks
is super super pretty and this color
honey screams tropical flowers and stuff
so I thought it was super appropriate
for summer or if you're going for my
heart just a really gorgeous lip option
next up is another liquid lipstick and
it is the color that I have on my lips
right now but I have the next product
after this on top of that but this is
the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipstick in retro coral I love a coral
one I mean wonderful what kind of car
what was definitely more like a ready
paint nature this is definitely more on
that be a pinky or orange e a peachy
aside so if you like a slightly lighter
brighter lip this one is such a gorgeous
color I mean the brands and stuff that
I'm showing you you could totally a
switch out just finding that I just love
these kind of colors just Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks the
formula is honestly one of the best long
wearing comfortable liquid lipsticks as
well there is so so so many colors to
choose from I'll leave the link to the
liquid lipsticks down below but honestly
I love this one as you can see it's on
my lips right now if you can see what it
looks like I feel like it just makes
large eyes pop if you had a darker
complexion I feel like this would
actually be really stunning as more of a
nude but like a coral inu type thing so
maybe with like a darker lip liner
create their own brains
possibilities are endless but I
literally love these kind of colors so
definitely had to throw that one in
there but if you're not a fan of a
bright colors have no fear I have a
lipgloss for you that I need actually
obsessed with at the moment it is via
buxom at salon lip polish in Katy on a
few probably one of the most gorgeous
lip glosses I've ever seen I will do a
close-up of it for you but it's
basically like a paralysed
Coralie pimp pinky peachy kind of color
literally I've got it on top of the
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
right now totally wear this on top of
the NYX one as well but if you just
wanted to wear something on its own and
just a kind of super pretty if you
prefer more of like a dramatic iron just
something really quick and effortless on
your lips this is absolute sign they're
full-on lip polish range is such a
pigmented lip gloss range they make your
lips kind of tingle and plump as well
which is really good if you have
slightly smaller lips or like the
appearance of bigger lips anyway but
this one is gonna see it's so pretty
I've been reaching for it so much more
it's just kind of like a glove to maybe
warm up a nude lip does that make sense
but not apply it too much color or
anything as such a gorgeous sparkle to
it
so if you haven't already definitely
check this one out and finally one final
lip product that it's probably one of
the most important ones all this makeup
and all this being on the sign that you
want to make sure that your lips are
staying hydrated and nourished and I and
literally you don't know I love this
this is the apartments lip balm this is
the coconut scented one they definitely
do a watermelon and in mango watermelon
was definitely my favorite but I love a
good coconut scented product they are
just so misty like so small so compact
just pop it in your beach bag and bag
out to dinner type thing whatever this
before you go to bed on your holidays
before you go out and the Sun just
always good to keep your lips and
nourish and hydrating and the coconut I
think does specialize most be in being a
super hydrating and keeping your lips
moisturize there's nothing worse than
dry lips on a holiday so maybe like
before you just start your makeup just a
quick prep of the lips if you're going
to be a parent applying a lot of matte
lipsticks of holiday or anything like
that usually make sure that they're
nourishing in the best condition that
they can so I really loved this one so
