sizing sighs I realize I've made a real
big mistake I'm wearing a black jumper I
got my black backdrop so sorry I look
like a floating head so I asked you guys
on Twitter what look you want to see I
was kind of really loving your responses
because they're exactly what I wanted to
do you guys also like a sunset smokey
eye and there's loads of requests to use
modern - arms palette and something like
peachy and orange II so I kind of
combined it all together and did a
sunset smokey eye using the monomers on
this planet and a peachy orange lip so I
really hope you guys enjoy this tutorial
you could totally pair this with a nude
lip or a purple
you can totally pair this with like a
nude lip or a perfect lip or pinky lit
because they're kind of all the colors
I've used in the crease but I thought I
would go with an orange because I'm not
done or in different ages I recently
have got some new products not just the
lip stuff but other stuff as well which
I'm trying out in this video I
definitely plan to do a full face of
first impressions video so give the food
at thumbs up if you want to see that
without me rambling on let's get on with
the tutorial
but first things first I'm going to
prime my face i'm using the smashbox
photo filter primer this one's
definitely more like a smoothing primer
so i'm going to go ahead and apply that
with my fingers just to make sure it is
like officially pressed into my skin you
guys knowing you like to use a brush but
today I was using my fingers and the
foundation I am going to use the
hourglass of stick foundation and I'm
mixing two colors together I'm mixing
the shade warm beige and golden tan I
think it is and I'm trying it with the
Ecotools of sponge which I recently got
and I've really been loving it's a
really firm sponge so I feel like it
really presses everything into the skin
so I really recommend this one if you
guys are in the hunt for like a
drugstore sponge to blend your
foundation in and for concealer I'm
using the NARS radiant creamy concealer
in canal I think that's how you
pronounce it and it's the sponge I
literally just mentioned comes as a duo
and this is the mini one and you can see
has a really flat top so this is really
perfect for like blending in your under
eyes and again it's like that same that
firm consistency I'm obviously applying
it damp but it is still really firm even
when it is damp so I feel like it really
it blends everything into the skin then
I'm going to go ahead and fake my under
eye even the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder you guys know I love this
I'm going to lead the powder there for a
little while and do the eyes in between
this is because it was a bit worried
that applying any glitter or shadow just
in case there was a fallout I was going
to be able to wipe it away for my
eyebrows I'm taking new NYX and micro
brow pencil to fill in the front of my
brows and this is in the shade ash brown
and then this is a new product I was
using this is the blink brow bar gel
sculpt in the shade cinnamon something I
think I've left the name of it down
below I'm just using this to fill in the
tail of my brow again this is a new
product I was trying out and I really
like it it's not too full coverage but
then it for the Amane kind of star of
this video I'm using the modern
renaissance palette like literally on my
whole eye as my crease color so taking
burnt orange to star then Ryoga and I'm
going to apply this shade kind of
halfway across the lid and then it blend
it into the crease normally you guys
know when it comes to crease colors I
concentrate them more and more like
outwards but this one we're taking all
the way across the lid because I really
want there to be a noticeable transition
and create that kind of sunset
appearance so then I'm going in with
love-letter which is a pink shade and
kind of play from that just before that
other color you guys can kind of see
I'm doing it's kind of hard to explain
but then I'm just blending that up into
the crease and then again going back in
with the brush that I use previously so
I'm getting still a little bit of that
color through and it's still going to
blend all together you guys know and
then I'm going to use this dark brown
shade just on the very outer most part
it's um a little shader brush just to
kind of finish off the transition this
is going to be like the darkest color
that we use and I thought Brown is a
really nice soft transition cuz I don't
even think there's black in the sunset
it's always probably like a really dark
red or something we're just applying
that in to the outer most part of my eye
and then using all the previous brushes
to kind of blend them all together then
taking a bit of my NARS concealer and
I'm just going to use this in the front
part of my eye just so I can really get
a bright lid space for anything I put on
the top it's going to really shine
through and just diffusing that into the
crease colors and I always like to use
my finger just to Pat that in just so
it's all softly blended together and I'm
taking a Riviera as my lid color just
because of the two kind of Maine
shimmery shades this one's a slightly
more warmer one so I thought Asus's of
sunset smokey eye it was kind of more
appropriate but I did go ahead and apply
a glitter as you'll see in a minute I'm
just taking a pencil brush with that
orange shade and just blending that back
in between the crease colors and that
lid shades just so I get that color
payoff and then I'm taking this glitter
this is from Make Up For Ever it is in
the shade it bronzed for I think just
applying that to face critically as a
base and then pressing on the top I
really kind of didn't want to pick up
too much visible I did want that to be
more of like a bronze beginning so I
thought this was like the perfect kind
of color or product to use then I'm
taking a liberally toasted gel liner
from Sigma which is a read dark brown I
didn't want to use any black because I
hadn't in the crease and I wanted to
take that dark brown shade from the
modern renaissance product to kind of
smoke out and create more of a smoky
liner effect and I didn't do a wing
either because I wanted this to be more
of like a blown out look so as I said
previously just taking that same brush
and that same dark brown color from the
palette just using that to blend that in
then I'm just going to go ahead and
apply mascara and you could totally
leave it there and I kind of wish I was
slightly less dramatic lashes as you'll
see because I want to be able to see the
eyes a bit more but I did go ahead and
use these backstage
lashes from a Rodeo Drive and while they
were drying I just brushed away because
I'm kind of done with all the stuff on
the top brushed away their kind of
powder underneath
and then highlighted my inner corner and
then basically mimicked what I did on
the top on the bottom so again the
Riviera shade then the I'm going to
forgot on it but the orange shade and
then that love-letter shade on the
outermost part just like I said to mimic
what we did on the top and it really
emphasized that gradient sunset effect
then I just applied a bottom lash
mascara I mean it's the same line as I
use before but it's applied mascara to
my bottom lashes and then stuck my
lashes on and I'll see it there it's
still drying but these are the finished
eyes then moving on to the skin I'm
taking my peaches bronzer in the shade
medium dark to warm up my complexion
then I'm just kind of faking underneath
where I applied that bronzer just so it
like appears a bit more chiseled and
defined which is a really handy tip if
you find that your bronzer kind of just
like blends in but then it took kind of
go with the color scheme I'm taking this
blusher from Becca it isn't the color
Tigerlily you guys I love this it's like
their luminous blusher range I
definitely want to get more shape in
this because the formula is really
gorgeous and then for highlighter I am
it taking the Ofra highlighter in Rodeo
Drive and is applying that with my
Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighting
brush literally kind of dancing it all
over my cheekbones down the bridge of my
nose above my brows literally just
everywhere because you know then I'm
just dusting away at that powder
underneath you can see it makes
literally such a difference I feel
personally if you go before and after I
feel like it makes a difference and then
for the lips I am it taking this pull up
from hourglass is one of their kind of
like velvet matte liquid lipsticks and
this is in the color this one I think is
in the color Riviera I think I was an
eyeshadow called that and I breathing it
was the orange one so maybe guys like an
orange Riviera or something somewhere in
the world but I'm just applying that all
over the lips and this is a matte finish
so if you prefer more than matte finish
you could totally leave it there but I
wanted definitely more of a glossy
finish I hadn't used these yet and this
is the Too Faced peach oil lip gloss and
this one is in the color pop and peach
and I just applied that all over the top
for the finished look so this is the
finished makeup look
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
