hey guys welcome back to my channel
today's video is a super exciting so the
content of this video is basically I'm
going to show you how to create this
ultimate kind of glam look I look I know
you guys love you interview a list like
prom or a party or something like that
and basically I have teamed up with w7
at cosmetics and you've never heard of
them it they are a brand that do kind of
high-end dupes of makeup but much more
affordable price but you're still are
not kind of missing out on the quality
of them so I thought this is such a good
idea for a video I want to create a glam
look and show you that you don't have to
break the bank with it and you can use
these amazing alternatives and still get
the same look I really hope you guys
enjoy this video so I did a wind-god
smokey I am at a nude lip which is kind
of a save option but I thought that's a
kind of limit like a lot of people want
to learn but I know how to create and
don't always want to spend loads of
money on the high-end products and
palettes and all that kind of stuff to
be able to achieve it so I really hope
you guys enjoy the concept of this video
and you've never had a w7 before maybe
this will introduce you to your new
favorite brand I'm literally obsessed
with the way that this makeup came out
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video
I've listening to everything down below
so definitely make sure to check out and
check out the other perks that they have
as well because if you don't necessarily
like this look that like the concept of
the video then definitely check out all
of their other products yeah without
further ado I will show you how to get
this ultimate Gramlich using affordable
high-end dupe scud-c / w some cosmetics
to begin I'm going to pry my eyes using
their I got the power eye primer base
which is a really full-coverage kind of
yellow skin it toned primer perfect for
applying item because it gets rid of any
color from underneath and then I'm going
to go ahead and let's set that in place
with powder to make blending a lot
easier and try shadow I'm using this
product this is their bronze clean
eyeshadow palette and I'm taking the
light warm brown shade and just buffing
that back on forth into our crease for
our initial transition color I'm going
to further deepen up the crease using
this dark brown shade you guys know the
drill on a slightly smaller fluffier
brush it's just so I can get right into
the crease and then blending upwards and
then going back in with the original
brush to make sure it's all blended
together and then taking the darkest
brown shade on an even smaller fluffy
brush just going to placing that on the
most outer part of my eye and then going
back in with the previous brushes that
we use just to make sure it is all
Abunda together for the lid I'm at
taking this a champagne gold color it's
super sparkly and I wanted to kind of
create a champagne gold smokey eye type
look something that would go with
everything and you could wear to
anything so I'm just using that shade
there and then I'm reinforcing the other
matte Brown shades that we'd already
used and going back in with the brushes
to make sure it is all blended together
then because this is a winged out look
you guys know I like to use a wipe to
clean up or the mess and give myself a
good base when we apply the eyeliner and
for eyeliner I'm using the extra fine
and liquid liner pen this is a really
kind of hard tip and it's super thin as
well as the name would imply so perfect
for getting in that inner corner and
getting a really sharp and defined wing
I then just like to tidy up with my
white and voila we are ready it's a cut
someone up with this wing and then we
can go in with the dark brown shade
again I just like to reinforce it
sometimes and then back in with our
other blending brushes and just kind of
keep going back and forth until you're
happy with it
then I'm going to go ahead and apply a
mascara this is their absolute lashes
mascara and then these lashes I'm
obsessed with them they get sicker as
they go out so perfect for a winged look
and they're super lightweight as well so
they are super comfortable gentle brows
I'm at taking that three in one brow
definer pencil and this is in the shade
it blonde just to fill in my eyebrows
then I'm going to move on to the skin
and I'm taking it there prime and globe
primer this is quite like a creamy
primer and I'm just using a duo fiber
brushes to apply it
I like anything that's going to
illuminate my skin which is what this
planet did and for foundation I am it
taking that genius foundation it is a
super lightweight foundation that you
can definitely build up it is super
comfortable and feels really like satiny
and velvety on the skin so if you like
that look definitely check this one out
they do a big range of crevices well
I've set all the information about it
down below and for concealer I'm taking
their catwalk concealer in the shade
fair this is definitely a medium to full
coverage concealer and a satin finish I
absolutely love the way that this turned
out on my skin and like I said I think I
took this in the shade fair because I
really wanted it to give me a really
bright under-eye and yeah I just loved
the finish a bit and now I am it taking
this this is their cream bronzer is
their bronzing a primer I'm using this
to cream at contour because it would not
be a glam look by me and I didn't cream
contour so I'm it just applying that to
all the places that I want to warm up so
tech tends to be the perimeters of my
face then at blending it with a sponge
then I'm going to set my whole face in
place using at their loose a sheer
powder I think this is in the shade at
natural beige but I found it to be light
enough to use underneath my eyes as well
which I really appreciated but yeah just
setting my whole face in place and then
I'm going to take their Hollywood glow
palette and take the bronzer from that
just to bronze and contour slightly I
loved the color of this bronzer it was
almost cool and warm toned mixed
together so it made a really nice
bronzer and contour shade then I'm going
to take their double act a bronzing and
blusher duo and I'm just going to take
the blusher from this is a gorgeous rose
gold blush it's super pigmented on the
apples of my cheeks and then going back
into that Hollywood glow palette
taking the highlighter from that and
just kind of dusting that on the top but
this is a glam look guys so I wanted my
highlight to pop so I'm taking it there
other highlighter and I'm just applying
it on a more defined brush so get that
glow this is their glow commotions
highlighter I'm just going to apply it
on my nose and my Cupid's bow as well
but going back to the eyes I'm going to
go back in with that dark brown shade
and just run that along my lower lash
line on a pencil brush just to connect
everything up together and then
obviously I'm going to go ahead and
apply mascara again this is the absolute
lashes mascara has a really defined
brush is amazing it separate
lashes and really gets all the little
lashes so perfect for your lower lashes
so these are the finished eyes a super
kind of glam winged out golden smokey
eye I know that you guys love and it's
perfect for kind of any occasion and now
on to the lips finally I'm at taking it
there twist up a pencil in the shade
rust a really gorgeous kind of dark nude
color and that these pencils are super
creamy and pigmented and really
comfortable to apply and then I'm going
in with their liquid lipstick I've left
the name of it down below but a really
gorgeous kind of rosy nude color and I
was really impressed with the
pigmentation of these these only really
needed one coat but yes that is the lips
and the look complete so this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you

show you that you can create a glam ugly
look the icon of where all the time and
