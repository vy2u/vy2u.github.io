today I decided to do a inspired look I
haven't done one in ages and before all
the kind of festive makeup comes I
wanted to quickly get this one in as I
feel like it's kind of full appropriate
as well
so I was really inspired by a picture
that I saw on makeup by Ariel's
Instagram and is this picture here of
Shay Mitchell and I was absolutely
obsessed with her like massively beachy
curly hair and the kind of recentl
bronze eyes and like a brown glossy lip
like I said I thought was totally
appropriate for that kind of autumn vibe
and it's really easy to do as well and I
think it kind of looks really put
together I know I let you just did a
hair and makeup tutorial but I thought
these curls are definitely a lot more
different and the parting is different
as well and I tweeted you guys awesome
if you wanted a tutorial and loads of
you said yes so I really hope you
enjoyed this video make sure to give it
a thumbs up if you do and subscribe if
you haven't already but let's go ahead
and get started
to begin I'm having my skin using the
pixi at makeup fixing spray and then
going in with my Mac strobe cream and
this is the peach one I think I wanted
to have like really a glowing skin from
underneath so I find that these two
works so so so well together rosewater
is amazing for your skin and at this
strobe cream as well is like the best
moisturizer ever for underneath your
makeup then I'm going to go in with a
primer this is the hangover X primer I
think from Too Faced just taking a
couple pumps and then using a brush to
kind of it place it and dot it around my
skin then using it downwards motions to
buff it in and make sure my skin has
really absorbed it all just so it
doesn't leave like a layer on our skin
the foundation I'm gonna take the Tom
Ford foundation stick in the shade
caramel I know and it's super super like
not the right color but I promise you it
matches the color of my neck and like I
always say we use a lighter color
concealer to color correct and yeah as I
just said for that I'm going to take the
Maybelline age rewind concealer in the
shade light and just place that in all
the places that I want to bring forward
and blend that together with a Beauty
Blender I love this concealer I feel
like it gives it such an amazing
coverage but feels so weightless on the
skin and it's from Maybelline so it's a
super affordable as well I like to take
up on the sides of my nose too just to
kind of add a bit of like a contouring
effect you can already see it's
lightened up my foundation as well so it
doesn't look so bad
and then for contour I'm going to take
this from peaches and cream and makeup
it is their cream contour I'm just going
to dot this in all the place that I'd
like to reduce and make look thinner and
then just buff that in with a brush and
then I do like to go in with my Beauty
Blender afterwards just to make sure
it's all that blends together and
there's no harsh lines and it's all it's
super kind of pressed into my skin
the powder I'm also taking one from
Peters makeup this is just their
translucent setting powder and I'm just
going to place that underneath my eyes
and basically just concentrating this
where we place the concealer because
then I'm going to use another powder
afterwards and this is from a sleek
makeup it is their luminous powder in
the shade 0-2 and I'm going to use this
in kind of all the places that I didn't
place concealer so just kind of on my
lower cheek area if that makes sense and
just kind of like around the perimeters
of my face it's just going to add a
little bit more coverage and like I said
it's got a luminous finish as well Shay
Mitchell had a really kind of a soft
bronzed look it wasn't anything too
harsh or there wasn't really a harsh
contour going on so I'm going in with
the Mac mineralized skinfinish in a dark
golden on a really light fluffy brush
and just using this to kind of set where
we place the cream at contour so at
nothing it too harsh or too heavy then
I'm going in with eyebrows I'm taking at
my brows in soft brown and then going in
with the benefit gimme brow in the shade
medium 3 I think this is and I think
these makeup artists like makeup by
Ariel and kind of those Instagram makeup
artists that you see they always seem to
use the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz
gives such kind of a soft brown effing
it to you it's structured so I'm just
using a little strokes to do that
towards the end of the brow and then as
I get towards the front I kind of like
to drag the product through and I always
like to use the spoolie that it comes
with as well just to kind of push the
product through and make sure there is
no harsh lines and I had a really
annoying spot just like in my brow so
even all that but then I'm going in with
a gimme brow products just to kind of
set everything in place and make my
brows appear a bit fuller
so that is the eyebrows done and now I'm
going to go back to the skin
i'ma taking this cover FX CLIC stic and
at the highlighting end of it I've
listed the shade exactly down below just
using that as kind of like a cream
highlighter base and then we're going to
go in with a powder highlighter this is
the NYX strobing strobe genius palette
and it taking one of the champagne
colors on a Mac two to four brush and it
just going over the top where we put the
cream highlighter for eyes I'm at taking
this incredibly like it's like I'm gonna
get our words out it's from blank canvas
cosmetics and it's basically filled with
a matte warm eyeshadow so I'm obsessed
with it and I'm taking just eight really
light warm orangey shade on a big fluffy
brush and taking this from inner to
outer corner Shay Mitchell had quite a
like it was really blown out so you want
to kind of concentrate a lot of the
product on the inner corner as well
don't be scared to kind of take it not
like quite far but like you know make it
really kind of smoky in the inner and
outer corner of the eye then I'm going
in with this shade at Coco which is
basically just a slightly deeper Brown
on the brush that it comes with actually
I was really impressed with this brush
blank canvas cosmetics that brushes are
incredible as you might already know but
then I'm just buffing that in it to a
decrease and then going back in with the
original a fluffy brush to just make
sure everything is really a blown out
and blended together
for the lid shade I'm taking this
prismatic eyeshadow from NYX in the
color liquid gold she had such a
gorgeous bronze II shimmery shade on her
lid and I thought this one was perfect
and just taking that on a really short
short a really a small shader brush to
make sure we can really pack on the
color and almost use it to define our
crease as well then going back in with
one of the fluffy brush that we used
earlier just to make sure the lid and
transition colors all the blends
together nicely and there is a no harsh
alliance then I'm mixing at these two
shades together on a really small
defined fluffy brush and just using that
to kind of define the crease and add a
bit more depth into our socket
going in with the same palette this is
the shade goddess I'm using a kind of
flat brush to highlight underneath my
brow bone and in my inner corner this is
like a really light white gold shimmery
color because I think that's kind of
what she had going on from what I could
tell from the picture and yeah just
using that to kind of really open up my
eye and lift up my brow then taking the
color Carmen I think this is just on a
another shader brush this one's a bit
more fluffy and a bit bigger I'm a
really smoking out my lower lashline and
connecting it to our top colors I like
our crease color so that makes sense and
then using a little concealer brush I am
just kind of using that to clean up just
using really light motions because we
don't want to move any product or kind
of smudge the product down as you can
see it works really well then it for
lashes these are ardell lashes with
individual stuck on them I'm going to
leave that desi Perkins custom lash
video it's down below if you want to
know how to do them but this is what a
lot of the makeup artists on Instagram
it do do to get that wispy effect and
then for the lips she definitely had
something a bit more darker than I
usually wear a bit more Brown as well so
this is the Kylie cosmetics gloss in
like on to the hair I am taking my
Bellamy curling wand and I'm taking a
really really thin one this one is the 9
millimeters by 13 millimeters wand and
I'm just sectioning my hair off and it
taking kind of small to medium sized
bits of hair to create really kind of
tight curls and we are going to brush
them out afterwards so we're not going
to look like a total doll but she
definitely had really it spring it curls
so I'm just gonna do that to my whole
head I do have a discount code for you
guys is Rach one at 60 and that entitles
you to a ton of money off the six and
one at curling set but I always leave
that linked down
in the description along with any other
discount codes that I have so we're
getting to the final sections of the
hair as you can see I did like my whole
head like this and I really remind
myself of that Nursery Rhyme character
Goldilocks that's the one is it going up
I think they're really tight curls and
then she had a massive like side parting
going on so I just sectioned off my hair
and then it sprayed a bit of hairspray
kind of brushed out the curls and used
it to kind of how I thought it looked in
the picture and that is the finished
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial make sure to give it a thumbs
up if you did and subscribe if you
haven't already and I'll see you in the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
