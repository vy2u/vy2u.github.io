today is a very highly requested cool
atone smokey eye something a little bit
different
normally I do lots of warm looks and
this will be a talk through tutorial so
let's get started so I'm going to start
I've already started off by priming my
eyes using the Sigma eyeshadow base in
persuade first I'm gonna be using a Mac
two to four and mixing the shades thorn
and chickadee from makeup geek and just
using that as our initial transition
shade I'm being really messy with this
because we're gonna clean it up with a
white it's always just good to start
with something warm in the crease I just
know it looks a lot more put together
that way actually I'm gonna actually
gonna start off stop it
so I am gonna do is take this shade from
luck C which is number 167
it's just basically a shimmery white
shade I'm actually gonna highlight my
inner corner and my brow bone first it's
a good news as a new thing I've been
doing and I actually
it just looks a little bit together up
in a my going quite heavy-handed with it
so don't be shy
this is just an Ohana to the bank
thanks I'm just going back into the
crease because messy as you will more
than a blend we're gonna do it anyway
okay next I'm taking the bomb by our
pallet from the bomb and this shader and
just further deepening up the crease
again being as messy as you want because
we're gonna tidy up with the wife
then I'm just gonna go back in with the
mattock two to four and just pop out the
key to a smoke I just always always
blend ok then I'm taking deaths in the
same palette this slightly darker gray
to again further deepen up the socket
like that now for the lid shade I'm
gonna be using this pigment from zoeva
called share the love and it's a
slightly warm silver but it it still
sort of complements the warm color in
the crease just using my Sigma xx rush
just pop that on and a half way across
the lid
and then from the same Bon Voyage
palette I'm just taking this dark top
shade here and using my Mac 242 and just
pressing that color on the lid the other
half the lid kind of blending it into
the shimmery shade that we just place
down I'm kind of switching between the
two brushes to just kind of blend it
together
then I'm mixing
then I'm mixing that shimmery shade
again with this shade here I'm just
putting it back to the crease again
these Rockets
and as messy as we want
devotion
then I'm just gonna use this eyeshadow
here which is Luxy number 104 which is a
really dark cool-toned round 2 again
just further define and deepen up the
crease this time on a blank canvas e 10
which is just a really really thin
buffing brush concentrating this color
on the outer third of the eye
you're going back in and blending it
now just taking a wipe I'm gonna take it
from the bottom of my lower lash line
just to where my eyebrow would extend
too
like that and then it going in with
makeup geek corrupt eyeshadow which is
just a matte black on a Dell iam tool
seven eight zero basically just a pencil
brush I'm going to kind of press the
black upwards and outer third of my eye
extending it slightly into the tail just
kind of keeping it there and then right
before going back in with one of the
blending brushes we used earlier and
just
I'll see Stewart the fool out
who's gonna go back into that original
pigment just to top up the color
then no smokey eye would be complete
without a winged liner so I'm just gonna
be using my NYC liquid liner to create
how I see line please
I think I might do a video on it just so
it saves me having to always do it in my
videos because it's a bugger to film cuz
I feel like you guys want to see it but
it takes me so long and especially with
this being a talk-through I'm just gonna
skip it but I'll show you the end result
so that's one I done that's both eyes
done with liner I'm just gonna go ahead
and apply mascara and use my Too Faced
better than sex mascara sample that I
got and my love me beauty gift box and
then I'm also gonna apply false lashes
but I will show you them after month
that's the eyes with just mascara
obviously you can go ahead and stop
there if you want to but I feel like a
smoky eye is a bit incomplete without
lashes so I'm gonna be using these these
are Chelsea's boutique lashes in number
12 and they are mink lashes and I got
mine from Beauty Bay calm so I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply them so this is
parts kind of halfway up to the eye look
finished so cuz this is just an eye
makeup tutorial I'm gonna go ahead and
do my face makeup off camera and I will
obviously leave everything I use on my
face in the description bar below and
the link to a foundation routine video
so this is the face makeup done now just
to finish off the eyes on a pencil brush
I'm just gonna take that middle shade
here and just buff that underneath my
lower lash line
and then on a shader brush I'm just
going to take that 104 luck cuz he
shaved a really dark cool brown and just
on the tip run that just really come up
into my lower lashes
then just gonna apply a coat of bottom
lash mascara
and those are the eyes done
now I'm just gonna apply a lip and I'll
be back so this is the finished look I
hope you guys like it something a bit
different I don't normally do many cool
tone looks on my channel so if you liked
