today is a very highly requested cool a
tone smoky eye something a little bit
different normally I do lots of warm
looks and this will be a talk through
tutorial so let's get started so I'm
going to start I've already started off
by priming my eyes using the Sigma I
shadowed base in persuade first I'm
going to be using a Mac 224 and mixing
the shades thorn and chickadee from
makeup geek and just using that as our
initial transition shade I'm being
really messy with this because we're
going to clean it up with a white it's
always just good to start with something
warm in the crease I just feel it looks
a lot more put together that way
actually I'm actually going to start off
stop under the street why I'm going to
do is take this shade from Luxy which is
number 167 it's just basically a
shimmery white shade I'm actually gonna
highlight my inner corner and my brow
bone first it's a canoe as a new thing
I've been doing and I actually really
just looks little bit together up in am
I going quite heavy handed with it so
don't be shy
this is just an open silver
thanks i'm just going back into the
crease there's messy as you will more
than a blend wouldn't have going over
anyway okay next I'm taking the bon
voyage palette from the bomb and this
shader and just further deepening up the
crease again being as messy as you want
because we're going to tidy up with a
white
then I'm just gonna go back into the mac
224 and just pop out the key to smoke I
just always always blend okay then I'm
taking desk in the same palette this
slightly darker gray to again further
deepen up the socket
like that now for the lid shade I'm
going to be using this pigment from
zoeva called share the love and it's a
slightly warm silver but it is still so
it complements the warm color in the
crease just using my Sigma e25 just pop
that on and a half way across the lid
and then from the same bon voyage
palette I'm just taking this dark top
shade here and using my mac 242 and just
pressing that color on the lid the
alcohol PhillyD kind of blending it into
the shimmery shade that we just place
down I'm kind of switching between the
two brushes to just kind of blend it
together
so then I'm mixing then I'm mixing that
shimmery shade again with this shade
here I'm just putting it back to the
crease again these rockets and as messy
as you want
chapter bush
then I'm just gonna use this eyeshadow
here which is Luxy number 104 which is a
really dark cool toned round two again
just further define and deepen up the
grease this time on a blank canvas eat n
which is just a really really thin
buffing brush concentrating this color
on the outer third of the eye
you're going back in i'm blending it
now just taking a wipe I'm gonna take it
from the bottom of my lower lashline
just where my eyebrow would extend to
like that and then going in with makeup
geek corrupt i shadow which is just a
matte black on a dell iam tool 780
basically just a pencil brush I'm going
to kind of press the black upwards in
the outer third of my eye
extending it slightly into the tail just
kind of keeping it there and then right
before going back in with one of the
blending brushes we used earlier and
just open that end
I'll see Stewart a fool
I'm just going to go back into the
original pigment just to top up the
color
no smokey I would be complete without a
winged liner so I'm just gonna be using
my NYC liquid liner to create kind of a
cat eye sea lion plea I think I might do
a video on it just so it saves me having
to always do it in my videos because
it's a bugger to film cuz I feel like
you guys want to see it but it takes me
so long and especially with this being a
talk through I'm just gonna skip it but
i'll show you the end result so that's
one I done got to both eyes done with
liner I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
mascara and use my to face better than
sex mascara sample that I got and might
love me beauty gift box and then I'm
also gonna apply false lashes but i will
show you them after month that's the
eyes with just mascara obviously you can
go ahead and stop there if you want to
but i feel like a smoky eye is a bit
incomplete without lashes so i'm going
to be using these these are Chelsea's
boutique lashes in number 12 and they
are mink lashes and I got mine from
Beauty be calm so I'm just gonna go
ahead and apply them so this is part
kind of halfway of the eye look finished
so are cuz this is just an eye makeup
tutorial I'm gonna go ahead and do my
face makeup off camera and I will
obviously leave everything I used on my
face in the description bar below and
the link to a foundation routine video
so this is the face makeup done now just
to finish off the ice on a pencil brush
I'm just gonna take that little shade
here and just buff that underneath my
lower lash line
then on a shader brush I'm just gonna
take that 104 Luxy shade the really dark
call brown and just on the tip run that
just really come up into my lower lashes
then just gonna apply a coat of bottom
lash mascara
and those are the ice done
now I'm just gonna apply a lip and I'll
be back so this is the finished look I
hope you guys like it something a bit
different I don't normally do many cool
