today I think this is going to be my
last prom at makeup installment if you
haven't seen my previous ones I will
leave them down below but yesterday I
thought I would do a more cool at time
kind of Ultima smokey eye - for those of
you that want a bit more of a heavier
ground for prom maybe you're wearing a
black dress and you want to kind of tie
that in with your eye makeup and you
want something a bit heavier and a bit
more glam this will be for you or you
just like a silver cool tan smokey eye
over the warm tan next anyway I really
hope you guys like I've done here I have
going to put a wing and again nudity
lips it might take any attention away
from the eyes and I'm literally in love
with it I'm normally such a warm kind of
colored girl I have kind of used almost
warmer toned school tones if that makes
sense
you'll see kind of throughout the video
but I really hope you guys love the look
of this makeup look and if you do
definitely make sure to give it a thumbs
up and hit that subscribe button down
below you haven't already it is going to
be a voiceover besides because I've done
so many trusty videos recently and I
have so many chat videos planned because
I've been reading all your comments down
below don't you worry about your boobs
yet this one is just going to be a talk
through I feel like I see comments as
well that some of you prefer these kind
of ones so I'm just kind of mixing about
how many more times currently kind of
yes anyway everything if you guys
enjoyed this makeup look and if you do
it then at to keep watching so to begin
I'm going to be using one of my old
favorite tricks when you're doing kind
of like a dark brown look and that's
applying tape it's going to make it
easier when we do our winged liner and
it's going to catch any fallout then to
prime my eyes I'm going to use the
Maybelline Color tattoo in the color
creme de nude basically just a flesh
tone at prime up with a really full
coverage so perfect for this look the
pigmentation that I chose is going to
really stand out and of course I'm just
setting with powder on to eyeshadow I'm
going to take this amazing cool toned
eyeshadow palette this is from morphe is
their 35k eyeshadow palette and then i'm
going to take this really light brown
cool tone brown shade and just use that
as our initial transition color then
then to further deepen the crease just
taking the kind of next darker shade
along that I could support and just
buffing that into the crease and taking
it slightly onto the lid on a slightly
smaller defined
fluffy brush you guys know the drill
just to create that smoky gradient
effect and then again further deepen the
crease but this time just placing it
slightly lower
and slightly less onto the lid but I did
use the same brush just because it was
kind of going on being played for the
lid I'm taking this amazing pigment from
Petrus makeup is called as disco but
first of all I am applying a little
adhesive and this is just a Mac eyeliner
mixing at medium
there's loads of companies that do
things like this but oh my god I'm
obsessed with this pigment um it's kind
of like a gold-tone silver so right up
my street so cool train looks so still
feel like it's got a little bit once to
it so if you guys like that as well
definitely check this out and then I'm
just going back in with that brush that
we used with the crease color just to
diffuse the two together then finally
I'm going to add a tiny bit of black in
the outermost part of my eye this is
going to make it easier when we apply
our eyeliner in case I make any mistakes
we can just then blend a little bit of
black into it and then I'm just going to
buff out and diffuse into the crease so
we haven't got any harsh lines again
we've got a proper smokey effect going
on and now for the inner corner I am
taking this matte white eyeshadow and
then going over with another peaches
pigment this is the color Prynne let's
just add such a gorgeous sparkle and
extra brightness for eyeliner I'm taking
the NYC liquid liner this is my go-to I
literally feel like it is the easiest
eyeliner to use when it doing liquid
liner and because we've got that tape
we've got a really good base and we can
be as messy as we want because we can
just peel away any of the mistakes then
I'm going to go ahead and apply mascara
and for eyelashes I'm using these from
peaches makeup in the style number 7
they are super thin and easy to apply
but just enough wispy Nessa to add some
drama to this look now for the fun part
you can just appear away at the tape and
see you're kind of effortlessly
mistake-free eye shadow and then I'm
just cleaning up any if fallout from
underneath
now of a moisturizer and prepping the
skin I'm going to take the new Urban
Decay hot springs moisturizer and for
primer look how we're just won a prize I
don't know if mine's just a weird one
guys this is a Illamasqua hydra veil and
it kind of comes out with like a paste
but it is so good it's so hydrating but
has it such an amazing kind of tak to it
so I feel like all makeup sticks to it
then I'm going to add a kind of
illuminator from underneath this is a
buxom and is Alfie stunning it's
champagne gold color it's going to give
me such a gorgeous glow from underneath
so perfect for prom and
foundation I've been really reaching to
this recently is the hourglass of
vanished foundation stick I'm in the
color golden beige right now to match
the color of my tan I'm just blending
that out with a damp Beauty Blender I
feel like they give literally a
Photoshop flawless finish and again a
pair of this concealer I feel like your
skin just looks incredible this is the
NARS radiant creamy concealer in the
shade custard so it's not going to be
super bright but is a bit lighter
obviously than my foundation which is
kind of the look I was going for you can
see I literally feel like it looks
airbrushed guys if you've never tried
this combination definitely give it a go
then I'm going to go ahead and set
things with powder and then do my
eyebrows I've been mixing up recently
but always kind of doing the same
technique now on to the finish late one
now on to finishing up the eyes and
we're taking this warm up Brown at kind
of gray eyeliner from Make Up For Ever
I've left the name of it down below and
then going back in with I think this is
the second crease color we use from the
same palette to buff that out and then
applying a bottom lash mascara and these
are the finished eyes I literally love
them onto bronzer I'm taking it be a
buxom Tahiti bronzer I had a bit of an
inception at moment there but now I'm
just buffing that into my cheeks to warm
up my skin this bronzer smells amazing
and literally it blends like a butter
I'm not even kidding
literally it been my go-to bronze of
recently I'm obsessed with it and now
onto blush I'm taking this cargo sunset
blusher I think it says I've left the
name and the links to everything it down
below and just applying that to my
cheeks it had a really cool just glow to
it it had some bronzer shades in which
made it super glowy and now I'm applying
my Maybelline that strobe stick as like
my highlighting its base I always go
back to this one I feel like it's so
easy to blend out onto the skin and
doesn't kind of like a breakaway or
foundation and then going on with a
loose highlighter and a fan brush this
is the Illumina Illuminati a diamond
glow powder from artists Kutcher
literally guys look at it pop and adding
a light loose powder highlighter on top
of a cream or even just a powder
highlighter on top of the cream just
makes it pop and stand out and I'm
literally applying it everywhere if you
can't already tell now onto the lips I'm
at taking it this suede matte lip pencil
from NYX in the shade London so
essentially just a dark matte nude shade
and then from liquid lipstick I'm going
back to an old favorite this is the
stealing all day liquid lipstick in the
shade calomel oh now you could just
leave it completely matte and this is
what the look looks like with it just
matte which might be up some of your
guys's streets but I decided to use a
clock and I'm so glad I did because I'm
literally now obsessed with this lip
combo
it's the l'oreal cream girls in that
protest queen so this was the finished
makeup look i really hope you guys

different to me color scheme wise as you
