today I obviously by the touch you can
tell I have filmed a simple spring
makeup tutorial so I kind of kept it
champagne II movie tones on the eyes and
a nice muted pink lip but I just wanted
to start it off by saying I'm really
sorry for their like lack of activity on
my channel at the moment
last week was a bit of Technology
standstill in the sense that my phone
got really wet and it just completely
died so I was kind of not able to use
Instagram what apps and like I had all
the lists of videos that I wanted to do
on my phone and I kind of didn't want to
be posting mediocre stuff as in like my
thumbnails might be as good because I
like edit than want my phone and I had
them all on my phone and stuff like that
so I kind of had a bit of a pause I
tried to post a bit on Instagram even
though it took me so long to post like
one make up photo and then this weekend
I've just been in Paris so I can't drink
filming then so today is Monday and I
thought right I'm not putting up any
more should we get down do it and film
so I created this look for you guys and
I really hope you like it and it's
because it's bullet mainly inspired by
some eyeshadows that I received from a
Luxio Beauty this is not supposed to be
a he sent it to me and said feel free to
do every one with them and they are
absolutely gorgeous I was not expecting
eyeshadows I knew they were sending me
brushes which
but they're just so so gorgeous yeah I
received these articles as well and this
little palette and I just thought it was
so appropriate for spring they're not
too dramatic there's so many different
shades in there with matte shades and
shimmery shades I thought I'm gonna do
it looking up right now so yeah I really
hope you guys like this look please give
it a thumbs up and leave comments below
on new videos that you want to see I'm
gonna try and get back into the swing of
things I know I'm really late with my
10,000 subscriber giveaway but I'm gonna
wait until 15,000 because we're really
close to that but it's all all the gifts
are gathering in my drawer got a couple
things from Paris as well from the
Sephora
so I hope it's gonna be really good and
I hope you guys are excited and without
me rambling on anymore let's get into it
so yeah so prior to filming I've already
done my foundation and eyebrows and I'll
leave all the products and brush details
in the description bar below
but the primaries I'm using my soft
ochre paint book by Mac and I'm using a
looksie I think it's the 211 brush just
to apply that and then I'm taking this
shade from that Luxy as well in the
number 176 to just set that primer and
then I'm using number 167 as a brow
highlight which is just a matte white
shade so you need any sort of bone and
white shape to do this
then I'm mixing peach smoothie and
chickadee from makeup geek into the
crease of the initial transition shade
and using the speech rate here called a
cupcake to further deepen that
as Luxy 2:05 crease brush as you can see
just makes everything so easy to blend
out taking the champagne shows lucky in
the number 208 and pressing this all on
to my leg fusing of Sigma e35 shader
brush this map burnt orange shade from
luxury in the number 105
I'm just further deepen the crease now
interface I'm taking the anastasia
beverly hills cream contour kit and the
like banana shade on a lucky 510 I think
this fountain foundation brush and
buffing that in with my multi tapered
kabuki
I often cielo I'm using the mac
mineralize skinfinish in life is to make
sure that there's no there's not going
to be any pleasing under I've just just
everything in place and to Brunn's I'm
using the Bobbi Brown highlighter in
bronze glow and yeah I know it is meant
to be a highlighter but on me it's much
more of a voice shimmery bronzer and it
gives such a nice rich this women I use
ever going to rather than a highlight
their been doing here
taking this shimmery pink shade from
lucky in the number 181 and just taking
that on the lower lash line
I then went ahead and applied mascara
and this is not extended play gigablack
lash but as you guys know I love try
lashes so I applied three ordered any
recipes just because they look really
nice without eyeliner and they just sort
of complete the eye look for me but here
I've just applied the new Mac pants of
in liner in the shade edge to edge which
is a really nice rosy pink shade and
then over the top I applied the
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in the shade and that's the completed
look I hope you guys liked it please
leave me comments down below I'm
thinking of doing a Q&amp;amp;A really soon so
leaving the questions that you would
like to know about me and I'll include
it in the 15,000 subscribers / 10,000
subscriber giveaway video yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
