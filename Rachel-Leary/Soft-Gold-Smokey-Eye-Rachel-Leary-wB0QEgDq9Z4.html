today I am recreating the look I wore to
my prom which is essentially just a sock
Gold smokey eye and a lot me request
this look so I go I would regret it for
you
so to prime my eyes like always I'm
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and
then going in with my mac studio fix
powder in empty 20 you can use any bone
shade shadow just to set that in place
then for my eye brows as always I'm
using the soap &amp;amp; Glory brow archery in
hot chocolate
next are the girls that did my makeup my
friend amber use gesso for Mac to
highlight like in a corner and my brow
bone which essentially is just a matte
white eye shadow you can use any that
you want
you
then using soft brown also from Mac
there's quite a few mat Gauchos in this
year's a mac makeup artist I just
blended that into the crease as always
then I'm taking a saddle from muck which
is just a deeper warm-up brown shade and
just further deepening up the crease as
you've probably seen the lots of my
tutorials this same person then I'm
going in with Swiss chocolate again just
over the same place I basically put
saddle but just a bit deeper into the
crease then I'm just going in with a
makeup wipe to give myself a really
clean cut edge you can do this with
concealer or using just an earbud and
some makeup remover whatever you find
easiest then going in with half-baked
from Urban Decay and just pressing this
all over my lid
you can use any shimmery gold shade just
something quite light and not too dark I
think is what I asked for and this was
the perfect color
add a bit of sparkle she then use New
Year's Eve pigman for our makeup geek to
further deepen up my crease I'm using
embark also from Mac on a fluffy brush
and just blending this across into the
lid but then like I said also using it
to deepen up the socket
using carbon from mac she actually used
blackout from urban decay to do this
part which i think is a bit more
pigmented and a bit more black so just
use whatever you want but this is what I
had to hand and I'm just kind of
pressing it into my crease to get the
most pigmentation I'm just doing a
classic winged liner I've recently did a
how to winged eyeliner tutorial so I
will link that below and then I'm just
applying mascara this is matte extended
play which is the best if you have the
short stubby lashes like mine but then
obviously I'm going in with false lashes
and these the House of lashes ikonics
on the day I think I actually used the
lil winning but they've both got that
winged out style so I used those ones to
prep my skin I'm using Mac's skin base
visage as a primer foundation I'm using
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk in the
shade six alpha concealer I'm using the
Urban Decay Naked skin on the day she
used Mac Pro Longwear in NC 20 but I've
run out that Martha yes that one's a bit
full of coverage as well but I prefer
the consistency of this one
set my under eyes I'm using the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade dim infusion or diffused light
it's one of the other I think one of
them might be a highlighter shade
Neverland might be a powder shade but
I'm using the powder shade then I'm
using my studio care blend matte powder
in the shade dark as a bronzer which is
amazing if you've got dry skin the
formula is powder works beautifully as a
contour so I'm just using that on as a
waver cheek brush to bronze up my skin
then I'm using two highlighters you
obviously do not have to this is Becca
shimmering skin perfecter in topaz which
is a really nice bronze shade and then
I'm also going to be going in with the
Becca shimmering skin versus where that
skin Perfector in moonstone for that
champagne I like
to finish off the eyes I'm going in with
texture by Mac which is of really really
warm shade and just running that under
my eyes in my pencil brush and then
obviously just applying my bottom lash
mascara to complete the eye look for my
lips I'm lining them with OCC pencil in
trick and then applying Mac bunny love
and the new crisp Akane NARS lip gloss
it's the pale pink one I can't quite
remember the name but I will list it
below and that is the finished look I
really hope you guys liked it some of
the products I switched up from the
exact picture on my Instagram but I will
link that picture below but I really
hope you guys liked it please leave any
video suggestions in the comments below
