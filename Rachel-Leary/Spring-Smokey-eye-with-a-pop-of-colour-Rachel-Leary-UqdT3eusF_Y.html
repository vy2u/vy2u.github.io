today I am doing this springtime smokey
eye with a pop of blue under the lash
line is something a bit different so
let's get started so this may be a bit
excessive for some people that my face
was feeling super dry I'm using fix+
L'Oreal Lumi magique primer and the
Smashbox primer water to prime my face
before foundation just because like I
said my face was feeling super dry and I
wanted all the moisture I could get
and to prime my eyes as always I'm using
my soft ochre Paint Pot from that to set
that primer I'm just using my nas
pressed powder just so when I show is
gone over the top they vent a lot more
easier you could use a bone colored
shadow to do this I'm then going in with
chickadee eyeshadow from makeup geek on
my Sigma e-40 as always
then using Mango Tango also from makeup
geek I'm just lending that further into
the crease to deepen up the color and
using Mac's pigment in whisper pink how
fitting this is limited edition but then
at the neck the matte Naked Lunch
eyeshadow is quite similar to this also
all the Mac's naked pigment based the
shimmery pink shade just on the lid I'm
then going in with Coco bear into the
crease as well just to blend out the
shadow that we've just placed onto the
lid and to make sure that everything is
blended seamlessly
I'm then using a bitten also from makeup
geek to finally deepen the crease and
it's just sticking with these warm
shades to make my eyes look a bit bluer
and just stick with this spring machine
then just creating a simple cat eye ring
kind of starting breathe thin and
getting a little thicker towards the
outside to create that cat eye effect
and just using my NYC liquid liner to do
this
and then it's just applying my favorite
mascara in preparation for salt seas and
for these I'm using the house of lashes
I connects the paper a really cool just
wing to them and they're not too
dramatic they add a bit of drama to the
look now for face makeup please ignore
what my hands I need to wash my paper
towel but us I'm using my makeup for
ever HD foundation in the shade 1 to 7
which I think a lot of you are gonna
tell me is too pale for me because I'm
really tanned and this is quite a light
one but I do deepen it up with bronzer
later on so hopefully you guys won't
care so much did you go ahead and do my
eyebrows off camera but I'm using the
soap &amp;amp; Glory brow artery and set it in
place with the gimme brow and benefit to
highlight I'm using the LA girl creamy
concealer in the shade creamy beige and
then I brighten up under my eyes with
the NARS creamy concealer in Chantilly
though I do something a bit different
today and use a cream highlighter and
this is just wonderful Topshop I'm not
sure on the color but it says glow on it
and I don't know if that's the shade or
not but to set my concealer I'm using
the mac studio fix powder in the shade
NC 20 just to brighten it up and set it
all in the place and then I'm using my
NARS all day luminous press powder in
the shade BG to set the rest of my face
now after the pop of color you can use
any pop of color you want I decided to
go for a bright blue and this is aqua
from Anastasia Beverly Hills which I'm
sure she does so in a single pan I'm
just taking that on a pencil brush under
the lash line and then using my favorite
bottom lash and star which is Mac's
extended play gigablack lash I'm just
applying
so that is the eyes completed now on to
lips I'm using my NYX soft matte lip
cream in the shade Cairo and then going
over the top of the Anastasia Beverly
Hills lip gloss in the shade vintage um
she did send me all of her lip gloss
which I am beyond grateful for so let me
guys let me know let me know guys that
you want to see maybe like a swatch
video of them all because there is quite
a few and they're all amazing but I'm
just going back in with the lip cream in
Cairo just to lighten it up again and
that's the end of the look so I really
hope you guys enjoyed it please let me
know future videos you would like to see
and in the future the giveaway will be
announced in my next video so stay tuned
for that one but and till next up until
next time guys I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
