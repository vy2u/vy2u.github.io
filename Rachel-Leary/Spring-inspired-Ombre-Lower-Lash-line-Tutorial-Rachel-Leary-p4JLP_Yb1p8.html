hey guys welcome back so i'm gonna do my
eyebrows and prep my eyes off camera all
product details will be down below then
i'm going to go ahead and do this I off
camera and show you how to do this one
I'm taking the single shadow burnt
orange from Anastasia Beverly Hills and
just buffing that into my crease as per
usual with my Sigma e-40 and we're only
going to be using like to crease colors
because they were keeping the top of the
I super minimal as there's so much going
on on the bottom so I'm keeping the
tones quite warm as well as their kind
of my favorites and then i'm taking the
color party dress from Anastasia Beverly
Hills as well and taking my sigma e25
brush and just using that to further
deepen and define the socket then I'm
going back in with my Sigma e-40 brush
again as this is like the magic a razor
brush of all time and it just softens
out all edges and make sure there's no
harsh lines for the lid like I said
keeping it super minimal I'm taking this
color from stealer and it's the color
kitten and it is the most amazing
champagne color like ever I think this
would be an amazing cheap bone highlight
as well I'm just patting that on the lid
with this Sigma shader brush and then
going back in with the Sigma e25 brush
with no extra product on and just kind
of using it to diffuse the line between
the shadow and the like crease colors
then taking a wipe and creating a wing
and I'm using my Sigma line a oh wait
I've skipped a step I'm taking the shade
blank from Anastasia Beverly Hills as
well and just using that to highlight my
eyebrow and my inner corner as you do
now i'm taking my sigma lioness and just
doing a really really small winged liner
and i'm just going to go ahead and do
that off-camera i also applied some top
lash mascara you can just leave it there
but i am going to use my fuller lashes
in the style what the fluff as as you
can see it they are gorgeous they're my
like favor and i'm a discount code and i
always leave it below moving onto the
skin i am using my benefit Porefessional
primer and just buffing that into the
skin with this real techniques i think
it's the multitask brush i always like
to apply my skin care products with a
brush I don't know why then I'm going
ahead and using my bourjois healthy mix
foundation in the color 56 I did have to
cut a match to my neck because I was a
bit more tan so that's why they might
have been a bit of a transformation
but yep that's what I'm using for
foundation and for concealer i'm taking
my NARS radiant creamy concealer in the
shade vanilla and just placement in all
the places that are usually would so
underneath my eyes also on my chin and
like Cupid's bow above my brows
essentially all the places that you want
to highlight and bring forward and then
I am just buffing that out with this
it's a waiver brush and yeah just
puffing away normally I would use my
Beauty Blender my sponge but I really
couldn't be bothered to run to the sink
and dampen it so I used a brush and I
actually really liked how it turned out
and I just soften the edges with my
foundation brush then to set that all in
place i'm taking my laura mercier
translucent setting powder and using
this with my sigma i think it's the f-35
brush i do link all my brushes and stuff
down below if you're interested all of
you guys always say that you think my
camera's like super filtered but i swear
to god is just this power like you can
see it just makes your skin look super
filtered super airbrush and it literally
doesn't move all the day with this
powder which is why i love it back onto
the eyes if you sort of my snapchat i
did give a little sneak preview of the
colors i was going to be using i'm
taking this gold color from the zoeva
graphic i set and it's called after
disco I think and I'm just placing that
in the inner most part of my eye as the
initial kind of transition color then
moving on it to this gorgeous mint green
color which is actually called min from
makeup geek if you're from the UK you
can get this from beautii bey i think
they still they stock that now and i'm
just using that to create the transition
between them as it was kind of more of a
green and then taking this makeup
forever Charli XCX collaboration pencil
in the shade m26 and using that as the
final blue color so kind of going from
yellow to blue with a bit of green in
the middle i'm absolutely in love with
it now back onto the skin i'm at taking
it the glamour bronze bronze up from
l'oreal and i did want to keep the skin
pretty Braun so I'm not going to apply
blusher and I'm moving straight on to
highlight and this is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills highlight in so Hollywood
oh my god obsessed I love it it's kind
of the same as like gilded honey or the
Kiko 208 eyeshadow but I kind of wanted
to keep it golden to kind of match with
the eyes and then
for the lips again won't keeping it
super minimal i use the kat von d
lipstick in Agatha and it kind of was
super pale so I did go ahead and Pat it
out with my finger but I did want to
keep it really minimal and sticking with
a gold theme it taking this lust a glass
for a mac in the color instant gold just
using that to kind of add a bit of gold
to the lip I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial this is the
finished look I give it a thumbs up if
you did a new future recommendations
below and I'll see you soon bye paint my
lips a bit bigger with this one and it
