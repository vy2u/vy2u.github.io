today I am doing a kind of bronzed
coppery summery inspired makeup look
using all products that you can get from
one place so if you guys like the
products that I'm using you can just do
a one-stop shop and that is look
fantastic if you guys don't already know
I'm actually an ambassador for look
fantastic so if that means we do a bit
of work together and I love showcasing
it there look fantastic beauty box each
month for you guys on my snapchat and it
means if anything exclusive happens with
them I can let you guys know so yeah
today I am doing this look using all
products that you can get there this
video is not sponsored before you say
that I just thought sometimes its help
if you'd like a makeup look getting all
the products in one place is so much
easier so you can just pop it all in one
basket and it all arrives together if
that makes sense yeah I will leave all
the links to all the products ideas down
below as long as this fantastic social
medias as well because their Instagram
feed is one of my favorites
you guys probably gonna leave comments
down below going but I've used so many
different products I've never even tried
before in this video and I really really
love the way that they came out and some
of them are not definitely at some
staples like I've tried a new foundation
and concealer setting powder I didn't
use Laura Mercier today guys yeah so if
you like the look of this makeup look
make sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already and
let's get started with the tutorial
to start off we want to glow it from
within so I'm using the Illamasqua
radiance veil primer all over my face
first face as always with my Real
Techniques multitask brush then for
foundation I'm trying to steal that
awkward serum or aqua glow serum
foundation because I have a tanned neck
and a pale face I'm mixing two together
I mixing the colors medium and tan
together obviously don't have to do this
I just got the shade medium and it was
too beige for me so I got the color tan
so it would add a bit more warmth to
match the color of my tan and it made
the perfect shade to color match for
eyebrows I'm using the Loreal brow
artist genius kit in medium dark and
benefit gimme brow I'm f---ing concealer
using the Maybelline age rewind I love
this concealer so much it is so creamy
but full coverage but because it's so
creamy it's so much easier to blend
sometimes with full coverage concealers
they can be so like not like stiff which
is really difficult to blend out on my
face but this one it blends out like a
dream and I'm just using a kind of joy
fiber buffer brush to do this
then for kind of like a cream a bronzing
effect I'm using the do you hoola from
benefit and just using this around the
perimeters of my face to add a bit of a
bronze tint to my skin and then I am
going in with the bare minerals
well-rested brightening powder I'm
obsessed with this it looks so you can
just see such a difference in the
footage it really really brightens up
under the eyes and it also adds coverage
as well because technically it's just a
mineral concealer rather than a setting
powder and I'm just pressing that into
the skin it rather than kind of dusting
it just because pressing it gives
maximum coverage and adds the most
brightness and absorbs the most product
then using my favorite bourgeois bronzer
and it smells delicious as you can tell
I'm taking a really big fluffy brush and
just bronzing all around my skin
basically where we put that cream
bronzer and just using this to set it in
place is wouldn't be a Rachel Leary
tutorial without a shimmery bronzer and
this is betty lou manizer by the balm
and taking a big fluffy brush again and
just dusting this all around so we look
super Bronte and summery and just do we
then take you my favorite blusher for
summer you guys seem use this before
this is the bomb at Big Mama
it's the perfect or was it big mono home
I think it was Big Mama
the perfect rose gold color and then
taking mary lou manizer by the balm I
swear the bomb just like the best face
products ever and I'm just using that to
highlight this highlighter is just so
pigmented as you can see when I looked
in the viewfinder I was done I'm
obsessed and you just loads of times and
I know you guys have seen it being used
loads of times before I swear it's like
the beauty gurus top highlighter
once you are glowing from the gods it's
time to move on to the eyes I'm taking
the bronze that we use on our face and
just buffing that into the crease
because you guys don't need a next
shadow you can just multi use the
products that you're already using this
is the perfect kind of warm toned color
for the crease like I said just taking a
fluffy brush and just blending that in
then taking this dark matte Brown a
color from at the Maybelline the nudes
palette
it's kind of got a bronzy tone to it so
I thought it was perfect for this look
I'm just taking the same brush and
buffing that into the crease again
slightly further down than the previous
color then taking this pigment from the
balm this is you by iFly I think and
just pressing that all over my lid as
you can see this is so up my street is
the perfect coppery shimmery color and
it really makes a bluey greeny eyes pop
and then from the same palette taking
this shimmery bronzer shade just using
that to kind of transition between the
pigment and the crease colors and add a
more bronzy tone to the look then taking
this darkest matte brown and just really
concentrating this on the outer part of
the eye not taking it too far in but
just concentrating it like I said in the
outermost part just to kind of create a
more sultry it's smoky coppery bronze
look then I'm basically repeating what I
did on the top on the bottom so running
that same pigment along the bottom of
the eye and then taking that shimmery
brown color just along the outer part
and then connecting in the middle then I
am mixing these two shimmery colors to
really highlight my inner corner and
kind of create a light to dark effect
going obviously from the inner corner
all the way to the outer part of my eye
then I'm just applying mascara this is
Maybelline lash sensational but
obviously you know me I'm going to go in
with false lashes afterwards but you can
just leave it as just mascara and this
is what it looks like but I'm going to
be taking the Ardell whispies but as you
can see I've placed individual eyelashes
just on the outer part just to make it a
bit more cat eye and a bit more with the
I've been loving customizing lashes at
the moment and obsessed with it now for
the lips I'm taking Illamasqua T's
lipstick all over this is a really
really pale so I do like to Pat it in
and just press the product into my lip
so I kind of take off some of
access onto my fingers so it's not so
intense then going in with this amazing
lipgloss from Elizabeth Arden it is the
sunset bronze part their holographic lip
gloss I think it was limited edition but
there are still other colors available
and that is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial give
it a thumbs up if you did make sure to
