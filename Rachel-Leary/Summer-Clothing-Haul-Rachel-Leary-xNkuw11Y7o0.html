today I thought I would do a clothing
law I have accumulated quite a lot of
clothes over the past couple of weeks
just because I'm going on holiday soon
and I've kind of told myself not to
spend so much money on makeup anymore
and get some clothes cuz my wardrobe was
seriously lacking in that department so
I shopped at misguided a source and
stuff like that so I thought I would
show you what a big box of stuff it's
like a pair of shoes is what I thought
I'd show you so let's go ahead and get
started so the first thing I got was a
bikini just because like I said I'm
gonna hold a and it looks this so it's
got like quite cool back like that and
then the thin straps here and then one
thing I don't like about this is that
you can't adjust it to make it tighter
or looser because if I could I would
make it a bit tighter but it's really
pretty and I came with these matching
bottoms with the cool straps I really
like the straps like this I don't know
anything like this so yeah that's like
God misguided bikini wise then I got to
play suits both in the same kind of
style but slightly different so they're
both in like the Bardot style where it
like sits on your shoulders but this one
is like a lacy material you can see I
thought that would be good in like the
heat and stuff especially because it's
white so I'm not gonna be absorbing any
heat and then it's really lightweight
material and then looks like that I'm
not gonna do a try on just because well
maybe I will in like the next kind of
clothing video but just for this one I
just thought I want to show you so
that's what that one looks like then
next one I got I was really excited
about it's like a stripy one same kind
of style in the lightweight material
long-sleeved placing
I saw a girl and I can't remember her
name was but she wore at the style wall
party and I remember seeing online and
then I saw her wearing and that kind of
just like sealed the deal for me in town
to buy it because it looked really
pretty so so that was putting it like a
belt and a hat and something like yep
so that's what I got from misguided onto
a sauce so from a sauce I got another
bikini top and a bit annoyed with it
just because it looks a bit like not
what it was I just thought I was
ordering a leather bikini top when it
came it kind of looks like that and it
looks leather but then if any person
it's like I really like not quite
leather sole actually red ombre oh well
it'll do that looks like that and then I
just got some plain black kind of jersey
shorts just but I thought they've got
everything and not like denim shorts and
the heat just make me so hot and
uncomfortable so I prefer like the loose
fitted shirt so I got some fabric points
then I'll try and link everything below
so you get that idea of the picture and
stuff but yeah that's them and then I've
got this topic I really like it's like a
crochet Oh
I took a crochet hole to Knechtel zip
ties on the top and then ties around
your back like that and it's really
flattering on so I'm really pleased at
that and I think that'll be really nice
and holiday and like festivals and stuff
like that I think the last time I tried
to look or get this on ASOS it was
completely sold out so I'm really glad I
picked it up and in it still and still
commonly link it below is a pair of
shoes and I am in love with these
they're like this and then you kind of
tie them like constantly like around
your car did that make sense
and I tried them on earlier and I'm
wearing them tonight for my best
friend's birthday I'm so excited
they're so comfortable as well like this
that's really padded and supported which
I like an issue especially lights out so
I love them and I'm a size six and shoes
if you wanted you wanted to know but
from an online store called Windsor I
think you guys have seen me wearing that
bodysuit on my Instagram if not I will
leave my Instagram down below or you can
just follow me up reach leery but I
don't have that with me at this second
that I think it's in a wash but I'll
show you some of the other stuff that I
got from there so I've got this little
top kind of similar to that crochet and
helps make that you saw in terms of just
like material but it's just a little top
like that and it ties up at the front
and I thought it was really cute
it's got like a lace detail at the
as well I thought that would just look
nice with that there's that shorts or
something like that that was really
pretty then a few of the other stuff I
got a really bright stuff just because
I'm going on holiday to like with girls
holidays so like a party holiday and
everyone was lots of bright stuff there
so I've got this blue top that like
wraps around at the front and it's got
these little it like elastic waist did
that make sense
I don't know if tops have a waist but
like so it comes in and it comes quite
fitted and it's really flattering and I
really like to wear blue and you've got
a tan and stuff like that so I got that
as well I also got this yellow top oh
it's undone hold on let me do this so
yeah so it's got the little cutouts at
the front and it zips up at the back and
I thought that'd be really nice for
holiday with like again black shorts or
just something else just as like a pop
of colour and I quite like yellow into
town as well in which I totally forgot
to show you I also got this from a
source which is just another place OOP
but it's got like recalled bandeau top
and it's bright yellow and I just
thought that would look nice just in the
day or to throw on over the top of a
bikini welcome to the beach or something
like that comes down like this
I own a white one of these as well and I
really liked it the last one whom they
say I thought I would get one in like
another color what another thing I got
from Windsor is this crochet
long-sleeved top that you can just wear
on the top of just like a strappy top or
like a crop top or something like that
and that was really pretty and like
first of all appropriate as far as
holiday appropriate something quite
lightweight as well so it doesn't get
oh I really like this one also from
Windsor I got this bag that you guys
might see on my instagram recently it's
just like a little bucket bag and okay
tan color and I thought that I loved my
bags I have a black so I wanted to add
something a bit more summery in a bit
smaller and a bit more average papers on
the eye about that a bit more
lightweight so I really like to think of
that one also from Windsor I got another
place ooh I seem to be a bit playsuit
crazy alright so this is this one it's
got a bit of a ruffled top it's again a
bandeau like style but it's got a really
cool back it's like a crisscross back
like the OD suit that I had but at the
back and yet just comes down and like a
short style and it's got like fitted
like bra things in it so you don't have
to wear a bra with it which I thought
that was really good so that's that one
and I got something a little bit
different I got this like vest jacket
thing that like I think a loads of
people I've seen loads of people wearing
this kind of style thing at the moment
so I wanted to try it looks really nice
with like a white top underneath and
like dark jeans and something like that
really nice for nights out especially in
the summer when you want to wear like a
jacket or like another layer but you
don't want to wear something
long-sleeved so I really liked that one
and I think that is it I plan to get a
bit more clothes for my holiday and
stuff like that and I'm sure I will post
it on my Instagram but I think that's
everything in terms of clothes I
definitely need to do a makeup haul soon
so keep an eye out for that I'm going to
be pre filming also a bit before my
holiday so let me know in the comments
below what you want to see while I'm
away but and tonics time I'll see you
soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
