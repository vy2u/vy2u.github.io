starting off with a blank face
I am hydrating my skin with my mac fix+
and using my Smashbox primer water to
prime my skin for foundation
foundation on my Instagram a lot of you
guys requested me to try out the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk so I'm just doing a
couple pumps of this on my face and
blending out with a Beauty Blender it
will look slightly more tanned just
because that is the color of my neck as
you can see so I need to color match it
to my neck
for eyebrows I'm using the slope and
glory brow archery in chopper I think it
is I will do a brow routine listen next
onto eyes I'm using my Mac soft ochre
painful as always as a base for my eye
shadows then going in with my jaclyn
hill morphe palette and this really warm
brown shade Mac saddle is a dupe for
this one if you can't get your hands on
this palette I'm just using my Sigma
e-40 brush to blend it into my crease
taking it this slightly darker Brown
from the same palette I'm using my Sigma
e25 brush to blend it into the crease
concentrating it on the inner corner and
outer corner then there taking this
Australia australis Australis metallic
eyeshadow in the shade called Gaga I
think the makeup revolution rose gold
foil is very similar I'm just placing
this in the center of my lid where I
hadn't placed the medium brown to create
a halo effect then mixing these two
purpley shades
I'm just placing them on the top of
where I just put that dark brown and
then blending it back in with a fluffy
brush then taking this shimmery
cranberry shade and placing that either
side of the rose gold seeing the stories
that we
and taking this glitter from OCC in the
color beige I'm just using a q-tip to
put eyelash glue on the top and then
using the same brush as before just to
press on the glitter watch the seeds we
live
then mixing these even darker brown
shadows I'm just going back into the
crease just to deepen it up
then using Mac soft and gentle I'm just
taking a bit of that on a pencil brush
to highlight my inner corner you can use
any shimmery champagne color you like
and just apply your favorite mascara to
your lashes I didn't apply much just
because I knew I was going to wear
falsies but if you don't want to wear
any of those lashes then apply a much
heavier coat or whatever feels
comfortable I used these lashes not sure
they are but with a breeze thin lash
band just because there's no eyeliner
next onto face I'm taking that la girl
pro conceal in the shade creamy beige
just to conceal under my eyes
I'm taking this double-ended
color-correcting creams from mac and the
pale yellow shade I'm just highlighting
under my eyes
the stories
to set under my eyes I'm using my live
mineralized skinfinish from Mac and to
set the rest of my face using my Fiji or
day luminous powder from NARS to bronze
my skin I'm using the NYC bronzer and my
Mac mineralized skinfinish in soft and
gentle to highlight my cheekbones then
taking that second brown shade that we
used on the eyes using a pencil brush to
take some the lower lash line again
concentrating it on the inner corner and
outer corner
then just basically repeating what we
did on the top going in with that
metallic shadow from Australis and then
placing that in the center of the lower
lash line
and taking my absolute favorite-- bottom
lash mascara this is mac gigablack lash
and just applying it to my bottom lashes
then taking this nude Jane Eyre Adele
pencil which is a new favorite of mine I
absolutely love it I'm just lining my
lips and then going in with the Kat Von
D lipstick in Agatha
and that's the finished look I really
hope you guys liked it please like the
video if you did it really helps me out
a lot
you can obviously pair this with any lip
color I just decided to go some nude but
yeah I really hope you guys liked it and
until next time I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
