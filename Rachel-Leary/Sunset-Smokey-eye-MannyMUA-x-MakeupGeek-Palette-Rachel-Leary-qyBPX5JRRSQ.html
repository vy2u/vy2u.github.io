today I have decided to do a kind of
sunset inspired smokey eye just using
the money MUA and makeup geek palette
this palette is literally staying for
like every day and like nights out if
you guys are lucky enough to get your
hands on it you guys know it's
phenomenal palette and I was watching a
Jeffrey stars recent tutorial where he
used it and he made me fall in love with
the Mars color so I know I wanted to do
something it incorporating that and it
was such like a warm color it just made
me think of like that sunset scenery and
it's been a lot warming here in the UK
so I was feeling very warm inspired did
that make sense so I created this kind
of sunset smokey eye there's no liner
it's rounded wispy lashes and a kind of
peachy lip kinda like my last one but a
bit more kind of like golden tones
running to it so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial give it a thumbs
up if you did and let's get started as
always I'm starting off with my brows
first using my super and Dori brow
artery and hot chocolate and my benefit
gimme brow then to prime my skin as we
are going to be doing the skin first
this time I'm using my Nivea post
aftershave balm in sensitive and just
using the Real Techniques
multitasker brush to apply this I think
nikkietutorials is like the creator of
this prime and it's literally amazing so
I'm using this as my primer then for
foundation I'm taking the ultra HD fluid
in the shade 127 slightly larger than I
normally would but as you can see you
really do have to ignore the crappy tan
on my neck it's in the last stages and
after this I did shower and scrub it off
so just ignore it for this video but I'm
just using a damp Beauty blender to
blend that into my skin
for my concealer I'm taking the NARS
creamy concealer in the shade
Chantilly and just applying that in all
the usual places I would and want to
highlight so underneath my eyes down the
bridge of my nose above my Cupid's bow
chin and my brows actually I didn't even
apply it down the bridge of my nose did
I know I didn't well there we go but
just in all the usual places that I
would and again using my Beauty Blender
to blend this out but this time using a
slightly tapered end
to set that in place I'm using my
favorite combination of powders this is
the Mac Studio Fix powder in NC 30 and
the hourglass ambient hourglass
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade diffuse light the NC 30 kind of
cancels out the brightness intensity a
little bit which I really like and then
the hourglass one kind of brings it back
so I'm kind of I don't you know I'm
doing but I really like the mix of them
together and my makeup lasts the longest
time when I use this so that is just
what I like and then it's a contour I'm
taking the shade sculpt from Mac it's a
pro powder and this is from the
Maleficent collection but it is a pro I
mean permanent product and you can get
it in a pan and I'm just using that to
contour because then I'm going in with
the betty lou manizer from the balm and
a massive fluffy brush because I was
really feeling that kind of warm sunset
eye and it just reminded me of holiday
skin and this bronzer kind of has a bit
more like shimmer to it so I'm just
using a massive brush from Sigma and
just taking that all around my skin for
blusher I'm taking this blusher from the
balm in Big Mama I think it's like a
dupe for the NARS orgasm or the deep
throat blush it's one or the other but
again it just has a really gorgeous
pinky gold tone running through it which
kind of reminded me of going on holiday
and stuff and then mixing these two
shades from Anastasia Beverly Hills glow
care and then making my brush damp with
fix+ first to really intensify the
highlight I'm just applying this to the
top of my cheekbones and the end of my
nose and my Cupid's bow as you can see
it's super intense which is why I love
it
now moving on to the eyes I am priming
my eyes with my Mac painterly paint-pot
and then taking the money
MUA palette and going in with the
original crease color which is I think
peaches and cream on a fluffy brush just
as the initial transition shade because
when I think of a sunset I think of a
perfect gradient so I was using as many
of the colors as I could then taking the
center shade again on a slightly more
denser fluffier brush I am taking this
to further deepen up the crease you guys
know it the drill then it going in with
this incredible Mars shade I'm taking a
smaller brush I think this is the e25
from Sigma and being really kind of not
careful with my placement but taking it
time into where I'm placing the shadow
because it is super super pigmented
taking it into the crease and kind of
creating a slightly more of a blown-out
wings kind of shape then it going back
in with my original fluffy brush and I
just kind of keep repeating the process
until I was happy with the intensity of
each shadow
then taking this shimmery peach shade as
my lid color and dampening it first with
my fix+
I'm just packing this onto the lid and
I'm just in love with how this color
turns out and how it goes so nicely with
the Mars color which is why I'm taking
the original brush that we use with the
Mars shade and just tapping it on to the
kind of connecting bit between the lid
shade in the crease shade so it blends
together then taking an even smaller
brush and the darkest shade in the
palette just using that in the most
outer part of my eye just to create that
final kind of gradient again going back
in with the fluffy crease brush and just
making sure everything blends together
seamlessly
to highlight my inner corner and brow
bone I am at taking the lighter shade in
the palette and just packing that in
obviously my inner corner and on my brow
bone I think they said isn't my previous
tutorial but this is like becoming my
favorite ever highlighting it shade for
these two areas I'm in love then taking
this eyeliner from neve cosmetics it's a
golden i can't actually find the name of
it on it i think it's the only golden
that they have and putting that in my
waterline then just taking it frappe i
think this is from the palette and just
running that on my lower lashline and
then taking a flat definer brush again
then taking that Mars shade and then
just packing that really really close to
my lash line up to smoke it out and
create a really sultry smoky gradient
sunset effect then just applying mascara
this is the Revlon all in one mascara
and lashes these are the velour lashes
and fill me up I do have a discount code
below and obviously it will link it
there then moving on it to the lips I'm
just applying the oak pencil by Mac I
wanted to keep the lips quite neutral
and just because the eyes I thought what
kind of statement enough but you could
use any lip color with this look that
kind of ties in with the eye like a pink
a dark purple even like a red or a coral
anything but you guys know I love a nude
so I'm just obviously lining my lips
with the oak pencil then to fill in my
lips I am it taking the lip tart in
there we go the lip tar in hush and just
applying that with my finger to get a
less intense color and kind of more of
just like a nude color both nude but it
does end up going kind of peachy kind of
like my last video yeah and then I'm
just using my finger to blend it all out
and then taking this lip gloss from dose
of colors in the shade blini which is
really it's a really nice peach with
like reflex of gold running through it
which I thought I'd really nicely in the
skin and eyes and that is the finished
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial give it a thumbs
up if you did and make sure to tag me if
