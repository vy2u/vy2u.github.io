I really want to do like a different
playing to my videos I feel like
everyone says that let's try again
alright welcome back to my channel today
is a testing video I love these kind of
videos especially when the products are
kind of funky and people are talking
about them and you just wanna know what
the hype is about as you can tell by the
title today we're gonna be testing
Crayola Beauty this basically just
launched on ASOS and it's based
obviously off of the popular children's
crayon the Crayola Crayons Ave they've
done in inspired makeup by it so I
thought why not let's put it to the test
see if it's any good cuz I'm Adam being
in a nightclub toy duck you see this
girl about a crown for lipstick I'd be
thinking what how drunk
Emma so I got a few of products all of
them are kind of called face crayons
hence why I've done my eyebrows already
there's an eye shadow palette there some
like highlighters and a mascara as well
the whole range is kind of super
brightly colored but I kind of got bits
that I think I'm gonna work on my face
how that tiny crown is gonna cover this
mug I have no idea
swimming for the lips even though it
says its face I don't know this could
literally be a hot mess let's find out
but before we do is personification a
Belle shoutout turn your hair and
today's shout-out goes to Shannon Darby
who says notification fell on as always
a love the look rate thank you so much
Shannon I really appreciate you I love
you too so without further ado let's be
little kids for a change and start
drawing on our face
City begin let's just talk about the
packaging so this is what I think I'm
gonna be using first this is their face
crayon in the color caramel which I got
as I thought would work well as you know
like a face color for me oh my god
it's literally a crayon so seeing you in
it looks alike this and that's the color
I chose but now I'm looking at it I feel
like it might be a tiny bit dark and I'm
gonna have to mix it with my concealer
color so we're really going to be doing
summit drawing today so let's do like a
little swatch we just dropped my face I
can't do my whole face dance I have my
turn to the side okay turning it to the
side Davao works better
um it's looking a little dark I won't
lie
smells banging oh look she smells like
berries okay I'm just gonna call of this
in the coverage build the bomb I guess
um okay bright let's this is just
looking a little bit too orange and dark
for me right now
let me mix this shade in I got this
shade as my concealer color this is
called desert sand and I'm looking at it
it looks really pink so this is the
color desert sand that I got to kind of
be like my highlight like my concealer
color but I'm feeling like I'm gonna
have to mix others in oh my god this is
a hot mess okay let me just start
working it into the skin and see I mean
it blends okay I need a bit obviously I
need a bit more on my forehead that's
this all it'd be good to sculpt out your
brows let's do that literally drawing
around them
 how right let's blend this eight
okay
it's definitely not gonna be my go-to
foundation that's for sure the coverage
is actually kind of okay it's very it's
definitely like light to medium and you
can definitely like build it up the
color and they definitely didn't have an
extensive color range and the one that I
went for is slightly on the wrong side
of the scale but let's move on so like I
said I'm gonna take the one in desert
sand as my concealer underneath my eyes
so I'm just gonna try and apply er
definitely works better on its side
otherwise you're not really gonna get
much it's just gonna be a bit pointless
so just I guess placing it in the places
that I usually would that's a blend that
out then no I mean it's no tar shape
taper like how does it even like tiny
thing this makeup line is very minimal
and natural but I'm excited to do the
next part I thought this actually might
be out of anything that I use work the
best so I got another one of the fit oh
my god I've definitely gone way too dog
was this one again I got another one of
the face crayons this one in the color
literally Brown and I thought I'll get
it as a cream contour cuz a lot of that
is very like sticky or whatever and
that's pretty dark so this is the color
brown and I guess I'm just gonna use it
hi would apply a cream contour oh I'm
literally just drawing on my face if
you're like I'm sketching
in real life like on my face this will
be good for a nose contour
she says doing it awfully underneath ok
let's try and blend this end I mean it
that kind of worked well in the sense
that I quite like using stick like
contour sticks and stuff and that was
literally just like a contour pen almost
all that crayon oh my god you know what
that's actually blended out really
easily and nicely like I'm not mad like
it's not leaving lines on my face like
the product is really you know blending
out into my skin fairly easily that
doesn't look bad at all
and the nose oh that's definitely by
like a favorite product so far I think
that worked that worked well with
contouring and stuff you don't want like
massive coverage you just want it to
look good be a nice color and blend I
was really scared at first that was
gonna be really really dark and I
wouldn't be able to work with it but I
think I'm not okay
you might be thinking but well work with
it so the next product I got is a bit of
a chubby crayon this is the highlighting
stick in law's blast off
bronze cuz you guys know I love a
shimmery a bronzer and they didn't
really have many like powder face
products it's all based on creams so I
thought I would get one of these whoo so
it looks like this again it just kind of
like a strobing stick so I feel like
this might work quite well too and I
really love the color so I'm just gonna
place this where I would normally place
my shimmery bronzer um okay I won't lie
the color is a little bit like great I
know they did other colors and I only
could face this off of the website and
sometimes yeah on websites the color
isn't what it seems and this is
definitely the case I thought this would
be a lot more golden but it kind of just
isn't doing anything I mean I'm going a
little bit but I think I'm just sweating
I don't really think that did much okay
now in terms of like highlighter and
stuff I feel like there might be
something in the eyeshadow palette that
would work well as a highlighter because
they didn't they only did the kind of
strobing sticks so but I wanted to try
you know something more that I would
wear so I'm gonna go ahead now and set
my face with powder and then we can dive
into the eyeshadow palette and do the
eyes and see if there's a highlighter in
there but oh actually no let's stop stop
stop stop yeah I forgot I got this it is
a pink crayon I got it for my lips but I
just thought this might work with a
cream blusher this is called mo Venus
nerveless styling so it looks like this
so let's just pop that on our cheeks
blend it out okay this is another pretty
product I'm a fan of cream blushes yeah
I don't mind that but I think that one's
quite nice it's a nice color
you know me don't like any blush is that
too too pink and that's a really nice
color I'm quite excited to try it out on
my lips oh yes go go ahead and set my
face with a powder like I usually would
and yeah then we can be back to delve
into this bad boy so just gonna head and
like I said set my face with powder and
it's safe to say the face products are
slightly questionable definitely my
favorite was the cream contour which I
actually thought was gonna be the worst
and they talked about the color wrong
and all of that stuff so this tutorial
is full of surprises but I have two
zoomed you in it to do the eyes so we
can Etsy on what the eyeshadow palette
is all about the packaging looks like
this and I haven't actually lips it
looks like do it right this wall okay
black and white I thought it was going
to be like rainbow I guess that looks
like the pack
of crayons so I went for they like warm
neutrals eyeshadow palette oh of course
and this is what it looks like now they
definitely it didn't really do much of a
close-up on the Asus website for me to
really like see what I was gonna be
getting I had no idea what was shimmers
no idea what was mattes
but just from looking at it one two
three four maybe a definitely matte
shades this one is questionable but all
the rest are shimmers I am really like a
loving this packaging though I think
that looks so cool so in terms of I
looks I'm kind of restricted I guess
it's just gonna have to be a neutral
bland but I guess that's the best way
for me to to test out I guess to see
mode actually use this on a regular
basis so I think I'm gonna start with
this color in the crease so let's give
it a little swirl oh not much fall out
but let's go ahead and apply
um we'll try again um I guess it's
showing up a little bit maybe it just
looks a lot you know more like darker in
the palate I don't know um okay we'll
just work with it in terms of blending
and application I can't really say much
because there's nothing really coming up
right now oh the hair up my face let's
just have to see what the next color is
like because nothing is really showing
up okay so moving on to the next matte
shade I'm gonna go with this color here
let's see if we have any better luck
this one's kind of like a desert sand
kind of color I will just pop that in
the crease as well
god damn it where's the pavement I feel
like they invested all their money into
the packaging because nothing's showing
up like I said this is a very natural
collection in the sense that it's so
natural it's not even there it's just
very very soft glam let's try one more
shade let's try the straight hair to
further deepen if it will actually you
know deepen
like crowler what the hell I really
wanted this to be good like nothing like
nothing uh fuck's sake man right let's
see if these shimmers are gonna be any
better so I feel like let's take a
bronzy color let's take this one here oh
we might have liftoff in the eyeshadow
department with the shimmers but uh
sorry not the most buttery
creamiest eyeshadow at every East it's a
nice bronze color complements the eyes
like my eyes I guess hey if I actually
can I'm gonna try and highlight my inner
corner with the giant you know champagne
gold kind of which I think I'm gonna try
and use as the highlighter showed on my
face let's pop that in the inner corner
oh okay that's pretty that one's okay
did the job then I'm just gonna run that
kind of camel color on a pencil brush
underneath my eye which has done sweet
Apple just to tie this hot mess together
so I guess that's it for the eye makeup
I couldn't really do much else with what
I was given
the shimmers definitely better than the
mattes but still questionable altogether
I don't know why they did the layout of
the palette like that it really doesn't
give you too too much to work with but
the next thing we'll do is mascara cuz
they had a mascara so let's get this out
woah oh my god it looks like a felt-tip
pen let's see what the brush is saying
okay so it's your classic kind of medium
sized a brush let's go ahead and apply
like I know I have tiny lashes but that
just takes the piss the brushes
doesn't really have any shape to it so
all I can really do is like roll it like
roll it through my lashes where are my
 lashes God let's see how it
works on the bottom lashes okay better
actually nice that's the best I can do
with that and normally I'd probably put
lashes on but I'm just gonna leave it
you know what like this is what my
lashes look like with that mascara and
it's gonna be a real testing video I'm
just gonna leave it as they are so these
are the finished totally glam
full-coverage glitter eyes that we've
got going on but um yeah all I can say
is that the shimmery shades weren't half
bad that's kind of all I can say because
there's nothing on my eyes literally
nothing so I guess the final step is the
lip which I'm just gonna take the face
crayon and mobilis for they didn't
really offer many lip options and this
says face crayon so I'm hoping that it
works because you'd think it would avoid
your products like this it has to work
on your lips I
tada I mean the colors nice and like I
said they smell really good I feel like
this is my first of a testing video
where I actually don't like it oh I
forgot to highlight my skin of course so
let's get back into that glorious
palette and take that champagne gold
color and pop that on the tops of my
cheekbones whoa
I mean it's pop it and again on the
other side just on my nose and cupid's
oh I'm done with this makeup look okay
you guys that was the end of the video
what do you think 10 out of 10 gorgeous
stunning full coverage pigmented all of
the above
definitely not I won't completely state
it I will say I do like that crayon as a
cream contour I think it's really easy
to use it blended out really nicely
yeah the application was great
everything else however is a little too
natural for me there's just no pigmen
using a crayon all over your face is a
little bit not practical if you're a
natural gal we're barely any makeup
which I don't know if any of that if any
of that applies to you if you guys
subscribe to my channel but those face
sticks might be good for maybe just like
spot concealing if you just only use
anything underneath your eye and you
want a really light coverage that's
literally what they're good for they did
do a super kind of colorful crayons on
the website tube which I wasn't really
sure how to use but maybe if you're more
of an artistic kind of experimental
colorful Pro makeup artist it might be
worth trying some of them but from what
I picked up and the look that I've done
you tell me I feel like it's a no from
me but I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video
regardless make sure to give it a thumbs
up if you did let me know if you still
are gonna be at trying any of the
stuff or just have a look on the website
down below I have linked everything if
you are interested I think it's safe to
say the concept was there of this being
recall and really unique but I think
they invested too much of their money
into the packaging and not enough into
the actual quality of the products but
again I do think that it is just meant
to be just for funsies and not for you
know professional beauty guru
criticizing yes I understand hope you
guys enjoyed this video share it with
your friends and for a laugh and a
giggle make sure to give it a thumbs up
subscribe before you leave for more
videos like this and I'll see you in the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
