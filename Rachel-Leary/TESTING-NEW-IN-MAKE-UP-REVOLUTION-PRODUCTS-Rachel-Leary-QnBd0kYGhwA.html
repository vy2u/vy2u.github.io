back to filming normal kind of type of
videos as you guys know I've recently
moved I'll insert my moving a vlog here
or something like that for you guys to
see but today we're gonna be testing a a
bunch of new in makeup from makeup
revolution make your revolution is
literally one of my favorite brands at
the moment they come out with new
products every week like I don't know
how the hell they do it but they do and
the quality of them I find is still
amazing so because they have so many
products it can probably be quite
overwhelming so I'm here to test out
some new in ones that I received
recently it was on my Instagram story is
not that long ago I was showing you this
tattoo brow these cushion color
correctors these gorgeous highlighting
palette and a ton of nude lip products
if you're liking the look of this video
so far make sure to hit the thumbs up
button and subscribe and the
notification of belt so you don't miss
any future videos speaking of that
notification well I didn't do it in my
last video because it's kind of a blog
and I completely forgot to be honest it
is time for a notification of Belle a
shout out time and it this week it goes
to Rebecca earlier that said
notification of belt fam thank you so
much for letting me know
here is your moment I love you and
appreciate you yes without further ado
if you want to see some of these new
make a revolution of products in action
and what they look like swatches the law
in please keep watching
okay so first things first I'm starting
with a completely a bare face because
the first probably we're going to use
you don't want any makeup on your face
it's recommended you start with a
completely cleaner face and that product
is the new makeup revolution brow tint
now you guys might have seen a similar
products like this from Maybelline like
then they baleen a brow tattoo it's the
same kind of concept basically it comes
in three colors that's like a taupe a
medium brown and a dark brown I'm also
gonna be using the dark brown shade so
it works like this it has a really
amazing kind of like gooey formula
almost and a brush applicator like so
and then all you do is basically just
brush on the brows that you wish to have
I love this idea especially if you go to
the gym a lot maybe or you just kind of
don't like to wear a lot of makeup just
having that instant brow without getting
the micro bladed or tattooed on this is
a really great kind of non permanent
solution so it says you can leave this
on for up to two hours depending on how
much you want it to last for I don't
have two hours to sit around and wait so
I'm going to leave this one for around
20 to 25 minutes I thought I should do
like one brow and then just show you
what it looks like compared to the other
brow but then I have to wait another 25
minutes for the other brow maybe I'll
just do them both but I'll split the
screen so I'll show you my brows before
and after okay so this is what my brows
look like before as you can see there's
just not too too much to them but they
have some shape going on it's like I
said I'm just gonna take the brow 10 and
a brush on how I want it to look I
actually find more is better with this
product because if you do less it just
doesn't really show up as well and I
know it sounds really scary but it's not
permanent so it's okay
so it's you're just gonna brush
brush this on like and the good thing
about this stuff is that you can go in
and tidy up with a makeup wipe if you
want to if you're quick but the aim is
that you're going to peel it off
afterwards so you do want to create like
a fish layer to it yeah just brushing it
through and then when I get to the front
obviously I don't want it to be like
completely block brow so I do kind of
like to draw on the brush strokes in a
way that's a little bit more natural
looking just kind of like that you guys
would have seen me do this in my vlog I
really do like doing it and I love the
concept of them yeah so that's kind of
the look we've got going on here so now
I'm just gonna go ahead and do the same
on this
just kind of following my shape
okay once you're happy with the shape of
those I'm gonna go ahead and set a timer
for 25 minutes let's wait for these
brows to form so like I said I've just
set the timer for 25 minutes so yeah
these are the brows during and then the
next bit is the fun part so go ahead go
make yourself a cup of tea and come back
and get ready to peel off these brows
okay it's been 25 minutes it's time to
peel off the brows I'll do one first so
I always kind of grab the tail and then
I just like to brush out some of the
part that I can't always peel please see
it doesn't seem I mean when it's like I
know it look like I put a lot on but it
really doesn't leave a huge you know
impression either the longer I could
have left it the more I'm sure it would
have didn't leave these on for up to two
hours or longer or less or whatever but
this was just after 25 minutes so let's
go ahead and pull off the other one
literally it doesn't come off or
anything like that I mean it does it be
really scrubbed with like makeup wipes
or anything like that but for the time
being
how good is that I'm literally obsessed
it was so different kind of quick if you
have 25 minutes to kill like I said it
fatal but in three shades not sure if
it's out yet but as soon as it is I'll
let you guys know I'm not sure what any
of this stuff is out yeah I know some of
its out and other lip products are the
cheap products out but whatever I've
used I will name it down below and list
it if I can I just thought I would
assume you in quickly to show you what
they look like this is no additional
product on it it's just that brow tint
but obviously if you wanted a bit more
precision a bit more darker color either
leave them on for longer or you can go
in with other product as well okay so
just apply the primer to my face and
before we go in with foundation I'm
gonna be showing you the new cushion
correctors so they come in five shades
your classic color correcting shades we
have an orange a peach a banana a green
and then just a general light shade so
how these work is there are you open it
up there's like a little cushion
applicator like so and the product is
inside the lid so I'm assuming you just
kind of give it like a couple of pumps
and then you've got the products on the
sponge and you can go ahead and apply it
where it sees fear so this is the orange
trade and this is really good for
getting rid of any blue tones or
anything like that on a slightly deeper
complexion this is the peach turn you
can see they get really good coverage
from this and this is again to help get
rid of any blue or purple undertones I
believe and help brighten on slightly
lighter and fairer skin tones this is
the green shade again really good for
helping get rid of any redness that you
may have this is the banana shade really
good for brightening and then finally
this is the light shade so again I'm not
sure the difference between this and the
banana because they're very very similar
this one is slightly less yellow I
believe so this one might just be good
for brightening and concealing as well
okay so on my face today I'm gonna go in
with the peach one underneath my eyes to
help get rid of the darkness I have
there the green one around my nose and
my mouth just where I have a little bit
of redness and I'll go ahead and use
like shade after I put the foundation on
I'll go in with this on the top so kind
of as like my concealer and to help
brighten underneath my eyes so let's go
with a peach Shafer I'm gonna give these
like a few pumps and just kind of press
that underneath my eyes you can already
see how well that gets rid of any kind
of blue undertones you might have which
is where a lot of people under your eyes
where a lot of people get this and the
sponge applicator makes that really kind
of comfortable to apply you can already
see the difference and the coverage of
this is really buildable as well I
actually really like this sponge I'm
only gonna use the sponge though to kind
of like a plier I'm gonna blend it out
with like a different brush yeah just
anywhere with that I have darkness so
that for a lot of people is around the
eye area if you have a slightly deeper
complexion Ernie the orange one might be
slightly better this one like I said is
the peach and then I'm just gonna take
the green shade and just apply that
around my nose I always get red here
does anybody else and I never really use
color correcting products but maybe I
will and I'll see if I notice a
difference in the way that my makeup
sets on the top and I also hold up a
redness just around my mouth area and a
few little so now we look like a
patchwork quilt off the bat I'm gonna
say the coverage of these is really nice
too buildable it's not too thick or
anything that I always get scared about
color correcting products because I get
confused when you have such maybe like
weird colors like green or red how does
your foundation go on the top I always
just get really nervous especially when
they're like thick can see this I'm like
how the hell does that blend but this
really is a really nice cream at
consistency and the sponge really thins
it out but then allows you to build up
the coverage so I'm really excited by
this and I'm just gonna work this into
my skin just using a brush
brainy covered up my darkness under
there and just gonna use the same brush
to kind of blend out the green as well
the finish of these looks along the
lines of like more of a matte satin type
vibe I'm not getting completely matte
but I think that's good because that
kind of mimics the appearance of kind of
natural skin and makes it a little bit
more easy to blend
okay so I've kind of blended them all
out the best I can
it only seems fifth I go in with the
makeup revolution at fast base
foundation stick to then apply on to
with this and hopefully it cover up and
let's just see how these work together
I'm really impressed with the blend
ability of those kind of characters
because they don't look like much
product just off the bat out of that
packaging but I can really notice a
difference especially with the apricot
shade of gangue rid of the kind of
Hollis I had going on and getting rid of
the darkness I had under there but now
finally I'll go in with the light shade
and kind of use this different act as
I've a concealer under eyeball right now
just going to go in and apply in all the
places that I'll kind of usually apply
concealer or like want to be brighter
maybe kind of wish I'm feeling like this
might be like a cream to powder type
finish because I mean it is creamy but
maybe I just prefer it to be it slightly
creamier yeah I'm just gonna apply that
and that was like the color lie
underneath my eyes and wherever and just
work it into the skin with a dance you
can see that blends out really nicely
and the coverage is almost like it's
obviously doing something but it really
feels super lightweight on the skin and
really just like nothing's there at all
so your intellect your color correcting
maybe definitely give these a shot I bet
they're gonna make some really funky
Instagram videos as well we'd like
doctor dots and stuff all over the face
yeah so I'll use the peach the green and
the light and I think that my my base
looks pretty good so I'm not just gonna
go ahead and set that with powder and
everything like that and then I'll be
back to show you the cheek and the lip
products which I'm staring at right now
okay so I've just gone and it set my
face with powder and applied a matte
powder bronzer because now it's time to
get our glow on so they've just come out
with these Renaissance illuminate kind
of palette type things we have kind of
more of your champagne gold more of a
paintbrush and more of a bronze so I
thought we're gonna have some jury skin
today because we're gonna use them all
they come in the most compact luxurious
packaging like this and I'll show you I
did showcase these are my insta stories
when I first got them but this is the
gleaming gold shade I love a more yellow
based highlighter I think this looks so
pretty this is the radiance rose color
again if you kind of switched your brush
around in all of them I think you'd get
a really gorgeous pearly shade or if you
concentrated more on each individual
color you kind of get more of like your
blusher colors and then just like a pop
in high leg and then finally we have the
most gorgeous shimmery bronze shade so
again you guys know I love a shimmery
bronzer and I'm just gonna show you how
I would use all of them so first up I am
gonna take this one this is the blissful
bronze one and I'm really just gonna
take my big fluffy brush and just swirl
it around the whole thing and
go ahead and dust this where you know I
always put my shimmery bronzer like the
perimeter of my face
and just like on my cheeks just give me
more of like a blow I'm I'm liking about
this is actually it's not too pigmented
you know because sometimes with products
like this they can be quite intimidating
or if you go on too heavily there's kind
of no turning back so this one's giving
me a really nice subtle flush I mean you
guys know it wouldn't be a look if I
didn't use a shimmery bronzer because
that's kind of like my thing you know
but that's what it looks like and I kind
of use my brush on all of them I'm
vibing so that's what that looks like on
the skin now I'm gonna move on to the
Arabian in Rose which is again more of
that pinky rosier undertone I'm not
gonna spoil my brush around the whole
thing this time I'm just kind of
concentrating it on the pink shade
because I'm going to use this as more
like an illuminating blusher obviously
it definitely is an illuminating blusher
and as I thought it's definitely got
more of that like pearlescent finish to
it
to give more of like a flush of pink to
the skin and finally I'm gonna take the
the gleaming of gold Renaissance
illuminate palette and again I think I
might spoil my brush around all of these
this shade here looks like a dupe for
the Fenty Beauty killer what
highlighting you've never tried that one
before yeah I'm just gonna take my brush
and kind of swirl it in all of them just
work on to the skin yes it definitely
has it the more yellow vibe to it I
actually kind of prefer its look gold
which is why I love the Fenty kilowatt
one I think if you have a slightly
deeper complexion as well the more
golden yellow undertones just look so
stunning
now I'm just going to pop that on my
Cupid's bow but this is the finished
skin and I have to say I'm actually
really impressed with them in the sense
that I'm glad they're not super super
overloaded ly pigmented that they're
really hard to use they're really easy
to use and super buildable and you get
kind of three colors in one so you can
really kind of customize the glow and
the color that you get I think my
favorite one was the bronze e one and
maybe the yellowy one surprise surprise
I'm loving them and especially this
bhujiya packaging is well like can we
just take a minute and finally moving on
to lip products they came out with this
huge nude collection containing a full
metallic liquid lipsticks for matte
liquid lipsticks and for goose lipsticks
I think so let me start off with the
metallic shades we have this gorgeous
kind of rose gold metallic shade which
is called a lingerie next up is this
really cute baby pink called bust yet
then we have this gorgeous coppery color
called courser and then finally this
deep red color called pixilated so they
will all be a metallic liquid lipsticks
I have to say I'm obviously more a fan
of the nude colors I think I need to get
on the metallic lip hype it was such a
trend but it's just not something that I
initially gravitate towards but I have
to say obviously if I was gonna pick one
I love that lingerie color so if you're
intermetallic lips these are like some
of gorgeous nude shades okay I'm moving
on to the matte liquid lipstick an
already tell there are some colors in
here that I am loving straight off the
bat so this is the matte liquid lipstick
in the colour undressed then we have the
matte kind of dustier pinky nude in the
color buff then we have a slightly
deeper I feel like a more cooler tone at
nude in the color
stripped then finally more like a warm
toned nude Brown in the color on display
I think when I first showed these on my
Instagram stories I was obsessed
with undressed and a buff as you can
probably tell they're just kind of like
a variation of news I'm not sure if they
had any other shades of the matte or
like if I just got sent those for
specifically but I'm really a vibing
away LaBeouf so I think that's gonna be
the one that I wear today
and then finally lost lipstick so I
don't think these are glosses but
they're just kind of glossy lipsticks if
that makes sense
so this is kind of like a cool tone nude
in there all this is more of a rosy
color by the way guys I feel like these
Stephanie are more glosses but this is
more of a rosy pink in du'a this is
again more of your kind of warmer tone
brown nude in the color exposed and then
finally a more like a lilac II gray cool
tone gloss this isn't the color skinny
dip and I think this looks like a really
cool color as you can see they are
really really a pigmented glosses if
they had a slightly more kind of pinkier
lighter nude kind of color I'm
definitely gonna be a picking that we
wanting to use the majority of the
products I'm gonna go ahead and take the
buff from that liquid lipstick and the
first gloss that we use the Barrett all
color I'm gonna go ahead and line my
lips actually using another myth new
makeup revolution product this is their
Renaissance lip liner in the color
greatest but I have a lip swatch video
going up on my Instagram showing a bunch
of these new pencils and the lipsticks
that go with them in action so that's
where you'll see what they look like but
I'm just gonna go ahead and line my lips
and then I can show you the products so
I've just gone ahead and lined my lips
with the greatest Renaissance lip liner
it's like the puffing nude lip liner and
then I'm gonna go in like I said with
the matte liquid lipstick in the color
bath
these smell they've got that like
vanilla smell to them which I really
love
so these two go together really well so
I am going to find I'm building up to
get the coverage that I want but these
are feel super super comfortable I kind
of like the fact that they feel quite
lightweight and you have to build up the
coverage because sometimes um they're so
thick off the bat and then they dried
that's when they feel really sticky and
you get that like cat's bum on look but
I'm like smacking my lips together and
they don't feel like they want to stick
or anything like that and that really
went with that lip liner served and
loving the way they look together but
now I'm just gonna go ahead and take the
gloss lipstick and bare all just so I'm
trying more of the products I probably
wouldn't usually wear these two together
they actually look really nice together
I think that looks really gray in the
tube but it's not when it's on the lips
and on top of a nude and the formula of
them is feels really like a lacquer but
a really comfortable like it doesn't
feel too too sticky
but like thick or that my lips are
literally sticking together but my hair
is gonna get stuck in them or anything
like that yeah I feel like that's
everything so that is the finished video
