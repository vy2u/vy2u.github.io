hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I am doing this kind of a glam
that testing at the Roy mark makeup I've
teamed up with Primark for this video to
show you that you guys can get a really
gorgeous at glam look using those of
their new products and they're precious
metals range without breaking the bank
which is amazing plus those of you are
people you i think of Primark makeup and
thought why not try out and let show you
guys that you can create a really
gorgeous glam look I really love how
this came out literally nothing as well
I think the maximum price of one of the
products is literally at 6 pounds which
is amazing so thumbs up for more formal
makeup videos so I really hope you guys
like the look of this makeup and make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you do
you need ever wanted to know how to hang
up makeup test out and if you can get
that glam look without breaking the bank
then please keep watching ok so I've
already gone ahead and apply my eyes
into my eyebrows I'll leave all the
other products that I'm using in this
video at down below but to begin I'm
going to take the precious metals
complete face palette that looks like
desert contains a highlighter a bronzer
three eye shows and did not actually
metallic the lip color today which are
really cool
but actually didn't go in with a bronzer
to start with and we're going to use
this as our initial transition color so
I'm just going to buff that into my
crease it's a brilliant nice warm brown
shade so perfect but also using your
eyes as well you guys I love warm Brown
shades in my crease
I think they just make it so much easier
we're not blending out it's a really
nice soft kind of loves like imagine
when we use this on our skin it will
look just as nice as well just like that
and then when I make this point like an
easy glam look so I'm literally going to
take this dark purple shadow here and
I'm going to use that to build up the
intensity in the crease by just kind of
dipping my brush in and out of that
purple and the brown and then two
strategies in the crease I'll just use
the purple shade it's good for first
impressions of this palette you get such
the size of the shadows are
big so you get a lot of products for the
price surprised that this palette is
actually just six pounds and you get up
see I'll show you every nose in it but
also what I love it's the size of the
pans are really big so like the
highlighter even the eyeshadows as well
I mean it's a little like lip products
that are in there so blend really nicely
as well now sort of in color I'm going
to use a different product I'm going to
take their cream eyeshadows if you
follow me on snapchat you've seen swatch
the B's and DS looks so amazing I really
love a cream item at the moment I think
they're perfect kind of sculpting out
your lip shape and stuff and they come
in two colors the top one is copper and
the bottom one is molten gold
this one's just slightly darker they are
literally only two pounds each and I'm
going to use the shade molten gold
become a little wand attitudes like that
so I do make sure to kind of wipe off
any excess if you don't to put if you
might join but I am going to use the
applicator to carve out my crease
lightly I'm just going to use lots of
little brush strokes I am obsessed with
this color it's a good really gorgeous
champagne gold cream color I think it
ties really nicely with like soft Browns
and purples and stuff which is the look
we're going for it's good because of
summer cream eyeshadows and they kind of
dry instantly so you don't get any sort
of playtime but with this one you can
see your others played on before it
dries down so you're able to blend it a
lot nicer okay I'm never going to go
back and it was a slightly smaller brush
and without saying that purple shade
from the palette this time I'm not going
to mix in with the brown because I
wanted to be slightly more intense I'm
just going to further deepen up the
crease like that and then I'm going to
go back in with the fluffy brush and
just above that end
like that I'm then going to take this a
big shade here this is the highlighting
shade that they have I'm going to use
that to highlight my brow bone I always
feel like highlighters are like a good
way to test the quality of makeup to so
many affordable highlight just just the
pigmentation is not that so let's go
ahead and put this under the brow
oh my god yes take meditation okay I
really like that shade in it that's
really pretty
pick a nice white gold I'm just going to
highlight my inner corner as well then
just going to take a wipe and clean up
underneath the eye because we are going
to do a little wing then I'm going to go
ahead and do my winged liner and in that
range they have kind of two shades of
wings of the liquid liner those is a
slightly metallic finish and I think is
really cool something quite different
and it adds a little bit of extra glam
to a look that might be quite minimal
like this so they have to chose who put
more of a metallic gray shade and a more
of a metallic poverty brown shade and
I'm going to take the family brown
shades to go with this look I can't see
the price on this one but I feel like
this would literally be only two pounds
maybe even less so if I know the price
I'll add it on the screen but yeah I'm
just going to take this one and create a
winged liner as a super super precise
brush you can get a really good line
there because already done my line on
this side and I am so impressed with the
pigmentation and again the quality of it
so this is like a deep plum eat our key
color I really appreciate a good liquid
liner was a really small brush because I
think it's so easy to just get carried
away and with a bigger brush it's easier
so that your liners just get thicker and
thicker so I keep down across it's time
for their wing
so once you keep going I'm just going to
take a little wipe and just clean it up
so that's it with the winged liner done
and I really really like this color I
think that was such a nice alternative
to just like black or something and I
feel like if you've got maybe the green
eyes would look particularly nicest
because purple and green really
complement each other and this is a
pretty gorgeous like dark brownie purple
so brilliant price of the pigmentation
too but I'm going to go back in with
that purple shade from the face palette
on the same pencil brush and just do my
almost thing of just buffing that into
the corner and just making it blend up
with my eye shadow and then just going
to go ahead and apply mascara and lashes
and I will be back soon suicide so I
just added a pair of my favorite lashes
I've left them in the description that's
down below but I'm so impressed with the
eye products I mean the cream hasn't
even transferred or crews the amount of
shades in that palette I feel like
you've got a really nice subtle smokey
eye going on
and yes I'm really impressed especially
for the price so thumbs up to me there
are a few of face and lip products that
I want to show you as well so I'm just
going to go ahead and do my face and
then I will show you the rest of the
product now we're going to finish off
the eyes for this I'm just going to take
that purple shade and run it along my
lower lash line just because on the top
it's quite simple so I thought I'd make
it kind of smoky and the neat sound you
can take that on a pencil brush just
kind of buff and really smoke it out and
you can apply some bottom lash mascara
and then that is the eyes fish so this
is what the finished eyes look like and
I can barely even tell the difference
this is definitely a look that I would
do a night out or something like that
and I'm so impaired to the pigmentation
and the color and the quality of the
products if you wanted to try their kind
of cream shadows or that palette
definitely check them out as you can see
you can still get an achievable in terms
of glamour but without breaking the bank
so let's move on to the rest of the face
I'm going to go
with that run for shade and just
obviously apply that where I would
usually apply a bronzer I really like
about this is that it's quite like a
cool toned bronzer but I feel like I
feel quite warm at the same time then
that sounds really like ridiculous but I
mean it's cool enough that you could use
that as a really nice contour color but
it's warm enough that like it's still
warming up my complexion and I feel like
I don't need to you know put anything
else like on my face moving away from
that I'm a complete face palette it for
a sec I am NOT going to go ahead and use
a cream highlighter as my base as you
guys now have been loving that technique
at the moment and these are the precious
metals liquid gloating I'm in two shades
this one is more of a rosy pink and this
one is more of a champagne golden that
is the color of this one as you can see
it's literally only two pounds on you
take a little bit of the gold one on my
finger just kind of warm it up on my
fingers and then press it in to the tops
of my cheeks okay so they kind of
applied really intensely but it's just a
strobing liquid so as I press it in and
blend the end it's definitely given a
lot more of Locker a subtle glow which I
quite like so you can't see like any
marks from it or anything it's blended
really nicely because sometimes add some
liquids you can like almost like to see
your strife but this is quite subtle
once that's applied and like Preston
just gives a really nice glow but now
that extra glam glow look I'm going to
go back in with this highlighter from
the palette and agenda buff that on top
of basically wells like that cream to
make it super intense oh girl
the formula of all the like powder
products like in the eyeshadows and
stuff is really really buttery so I'm
planning everything blends really nicely
onto the skin and prepare that
highlighter looks quite like really pale
and intense so I was scared it's going
to look like
ashy on me but at
can you blended quite nicely oh who is
this for oh my god without just going to
add something down the bridge of my nose
as well and just define at my cubicle
and then finally from the complete face
I'll I'm gonna pick this kind of nudie
color here it's a brilliant gorgeous
purpley a pinky nude I'm just creating a
lip brush got like a darker lip option
here as well but you guys know I love a
nude I really like this like a really
gorgeous
subtle soft pinky color but I kind of
want to add a bit more of like the
metallic theme going on that was a
really nice color for like everyday but
that's everything that we're going to be
using from this palette and like I said
this one is literally six pounds and I
used like the highlighter bronzer on the
eyes and everything like that so really
really amazing values money but I guess
I wanted to kind of stick with the more
metallic scene that we've got going on
and they have some metallic lip pencils
that is more of a pinky rosy color and
this one is in the color 24-bit so that
one that looks like slow slightly more
of the pinky color then we have this
really cool metallic Brown and this is
called it nothing else metal and it
looks like so if someone that's maybe
slightly more into that kind of like
grungy lip would really like this and
then finally they have a pale gold color
and this one is called Judas gold and it
looks like this and I'm you can take
that good as gold color and apply it in
the center of my lips
so that was the finished makeup look
using a ton of the new precious metals
range from a Primark as you can see I
really feel like you can score a for a
glam looks and literally half the price
than you normally would and it still
feels amazing quality and to me I think
it still looks really good
another item at offer in the range is
two of their precious metals and nail
varnishes this one is more of a
champagne gold and it is called rock and
gold and this one is more like that rose
gold color which is absolute gorgeous
called at start up again at these two
are only 2 pounds adjustable I would
include them to show you about the full
range and I just checked out the brush
applicator it's one of those really sick
ones it makes it so much easier to apply
to like taking your nails and stuff I
always prefer up there like sticker
applicators where my nails being done
yeah I think everything in the range
looks amazing if you've never tried
Primark makeup I hope this video gives
you a positive review on it and get too
excited to maybe try something new I
don't always think you have to break the
bank if you want to get a glamour look
because this I mean not everything lies
on my face whoops I'm prime up but the
stuff that I did use and showed you I
think looks amazing you should
definitely try out and that's the names
of the products I've used and everything
