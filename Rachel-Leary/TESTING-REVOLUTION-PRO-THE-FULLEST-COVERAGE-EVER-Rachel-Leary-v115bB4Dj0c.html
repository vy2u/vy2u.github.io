can say now these products don't smell
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
it's super exciting video today I feel
like maybe I say that on a lot of videos
but I thought this is exciting
and you guys know what makeup revolution
is like blowing up right now and not
long ago they announced their new kind
of sister brand under the same umbrella
called revolution Pro now this contains
a bunch of kind of Pro esque products
but price we can all afford and it's
accessible for all of us even if we're
not under the you know the pro kind of
band if you will I feel like it's just
pro because there's so many options like
color wise product wise all that kind of
thing and you can custom and just
basically kind of create anything that
you want and I feel like that's why it's
kind of under the Pro because that's
kind of what the pros do you know so as
soon as it was released I picked up a
bunch of stuff that I wanted to try and
test for you since then they've
definitely come out with a lot more
things so apologies if I haven't picked
out a product that is makeup revolution
Pro because I don't think at the time I
either one saw it or two it was
available I asked you guys on my Twitter
and Instagram what kind of look you
wanted me to use because this was the
eyeshadow palette that I picked up
because I wanted to be a bit more out of
my comfort zone and you something a bit
more colorful literally 95% of the
comments were a Sun set I which is what
I have done today I think it looks so
gorgeous so thank you guys for
recommending that I'm so blown away with
some of the skin products as well you
guys have no idea what's to come with
the highlighter the foundation the
concealer it's all too much but if

that video stay and watch this video see
how we created this look testing all
this new stuff you don't want to miss it
because for the price point your basket
is going to be so let's go
okay so because we're gonna be doing
that a rounded sunset I type of vibe I'm
gonna go ahead and do my skin fires
which I'm so excited about because they
have come out with some what looks like
really interesting skin products as well
so for primer they had a few a kind of
color correcting primers I decided to go
for the radiant
peach brightening primer anything that
is gonna help kind of really brighten up
my face and make it look illuminated and
just really just like full of life I
love to give them a go and I like the
fact that this is kind of more of an
orange base cuz I feel like it's gonna
mm-hmm oh I was saying I think it's
gonna really helps like right in my face
and make it really like luminous and
yeah brighten but this just kind of
looks like I can't see any like
pearlescent finishes to it right now
it's just kind of peach and I always
like to apply it with a brush okay
it's not Oh actually okay so because it
has kind of like quite a pigmented
peachy base if you look up underneath my
eyes where I've actually like applied
the primer that's really helped to get
rid of my dark under eyes err so it's
kind of acting almost as if like an
orange concealer would and really help
to conceal any darkness or any dark
areas that you might have in your face
already okay Oh because sometimes
correcting primers just like the color
doesn't actually really pay off as well
and it just kind of blends in to nothing
and that's kind of what I'm thinking did
that really even do anything but I can
see that the peach Ness of this it
doesn't necessarily leave like an
obvious peach layer to the skin it has
done its color correcting job in the
areas that I feel like it should have
I'm looking in my like monitor and it's
looking as if it's brightened up my face
really well and just kind of made it
look more awake really like the way that
primer worked on my skin now for some
serious coverage so I'm going to be
using the revolution Pro full coverage
camouflage foundation and I got this in
the shade F 12 because I kind of BAE
unlike the stick foundations that they
have f10 is like a good color for me but
it's like a tiny bit too light and so I
decided to go for f12 because from
memory I think well I did think that the
f11 was a little bit too a neutral tone
and I prefer more like a golden
undertone and I didn't get the drop
foundations because I wanted to get the
revolution Pro Foundation mixer drops
and I've got this in the illuminating
finish I kind of had a feeling this full
coverage Foundation Borough of a matte
finish and I like it to be more of a
satin finish so I wanted to mix these
two together and see how it worked so
I'm just gonna take like a little mixing
tray and give it a good old Oh dollop
there the color I by the way I ordered
all of this like online which I'm a kind
of a little bit annoyed at myself for
because since I ordered it online they
dropped more stuff that I could have got
to test so let me know if you want me to
do like a testing revolution Pro vol 2
and we can do like a totally different
look but now okay I'm gonna add just
maybe like one drop of the illuminating
drops just like that and I'm gonna give
it a little mix okay
that's mixed really nicely I kind of
thought that maybe mixing that in might
help to lighten up the color as well but
let's see how this applies on the skin
oh so maybe it kind of matches my tan
I'm hoping but like I said guys I did
kind of order this online base it off of
the foundation sticks
okay let's like a blend listen to the
skin and see how it works okay it's
blending really nicely for one because
sometimes with thick foundations you
know you really have to like work that
in it feels thick on your skin like not
nice I'm using a damp sponge which will
be making that easier to do and now I've
blended it out the color doesn't look so
bad it kind of matches a lot more to my
tan oh my god
that looks so nice oh my god and it I
swear this does not feel really thick
and heavy on the skin as well I
genuinely thought that this was almost
going to be like a paste and feel really
awful on the skin you can see that looks
way darker then it actually blends out
to be so I'm kind of happy about that in
the sense I really thought I'd just f'd
up my color just then I'm blending I am
so impressed I may even say I prefer
this over there stick foundation just
because or maybe it's because it is
meant to be more of a matte finish and I
just added one drop of that illuminating
foundation mix it and it's just like my
perfect custom finish and coverage
honestly that feels so nice on my skin
too like my skin looks airbrushed and I
only technically didn't redo any book I
still have some sort of like left on my
tray that I could apply to my skin but I
don't feel like I want or need anymore
my skin literally I don't know if it's
in combination with that primer and it
helps get rid of the darkness under my
eyes or just like genuinely brighten up
my skin I am just so happy with the way
that that's come out okay fingers
crossed the next product is just as
great this is their revolution Pro full
coverage camouflage concealer so I got
this in the color c7 which is what I
have they're concealing define in so
again I'm just gonna put some okay this
is like this is like heavy duty stuff
let's do one side first and then compare
so I'm gonna zoom you in okay so you can
kind of see I have some baggage
underneath my eye I'm just gonna take
the concealer with a kind of like
foundation brush again and just apply
this as I usually would with a concealer
but just kind of underneath my eye area
let's just start here off the bat I will
say it has got that full coverage tacky
sticky feeling that a lot of those kind
of tube concealers do have but now let's
just see how it blends out because just
because it applies that way doesn't
necessarily mean it's gonna feel that
way or anything like that so going in
with my sponge again this time taking
the tapered side and just
blend this in to the skin I'm glad I
went with c7 and not c5 which is another
color that I use cuz this one is kind of
bright enough for me I must say guys
that's blended out really nicely I don't
feel like it's gonna start creasing
which I do feel the lot of like I said
those troubied thick concealers look at
the difference that's blended out
literally into nothing like I feel that
that feels so comfortable on my skin and
not too thick let's go ahead and do our
other areas so I like to do my chin
Cupid's bow and the other side of my eye
let's go blending this I think would be
really good also for spot concealing
because it is that full of coverage but
looks really natural and not too thick
on the skin and just off the bat as well
sometimes full coverage products I don't
know about you guys but I've just
noticed sometimes full coverage products
like really thick heavy duty like
foundations or concealers have a really
weird smell I can say now these products
don't smell oh my god like that looks
does that not look like so flawless to
you I don't know if you prefer maybe if
you have slightly with your skin and you
tried the fast base stick and it was a
little bit too satiny for you or you
tried to conceal and define and again a
little bit too satiny for you had
amazing coverage but maybe just didn't
last I feel like these are like the
matte alternatives and like would work
obviously for any skin as I have kind of
more dry skin I did mix it with the
illuminating foundation drops which
might have made it a little bit more
comfortable for me these I feel like
have that map full coverage finish that
will last on any skin type especially
oily skin I have to say I am so
impressed with the way that that has
come out I am now gonna go ahead and set
my face with powder
I know revolution Pro have come out with
a powder thing wasn't there when I went
to buy it or at least I did
see it it is kind of that white powder
though obviously like HD powder for me I
personally know I don't really like
those powders but I mean if you want me
to test it I will I actually didn't see
it when I was purchasing it so I'm just
gonna use any regular powder and I'm
going to come back and show you what it
looks like when it's all set in place so
I went ahead and powdered in my face and
also took the liberty of applying just a
random bronzer and blush sure because I
didn't see that they've come out with
any of those yet so let me know if they
have or you know if they're planning to
because if they are I'm always in the
market for new blushes and bronzers I
don't know why I just get stuck in a rut
with the same ones so I applied powder
bronzer and blusher that's all I can say
I feel completely set in place I feel
like this isn't gonna go anywhere it
feels so comfortable on my skin and not
to toot my own horn but I feel like it
looks really nice like I've got loads of
lights on me right now and everything
just looks set and malice but now it's
time to go ahead and do eyebrows and
they actually did come out with a few
eyebrow products there were dip brows
and all that kind of stuff
my favorite kind of products to use are
dip brows but also micro brow pencils
like really thin at brow pencils I love
them I have tried the makeup revolution
dip brow so I thought why not try a brow
pencil sometimes drugstore brow pencils
can just come off a little bit red I've
got the kind of chocolate and I now
think I'm gonna regret it because I just
i've swatched it on my hand and it kind
of looks a little bit powerful but then
I don't want to get medium brown I
didn't want my eyebrows to be black so I
thought chocolate would be a good shout
but we will see we will see I may have
just picked the wrong color online but
we can just test the formula and see how
well it works so let's go ahead and zoom
you in and do that now okay so the way I
like to do my brows is go through with a
spoolie first and this comes with one
which is already already a good sign any
good brow pencil should come with a
spoolie like I said I'm just gonna take
the revolution Pro micro brow pencil in
chocolate you can see it is a super
super fine nib which is why I really
like can be a really precise with your
application so I'm just gonna start like
at the belly and just drag
product through and I'm barely applying
much pressure I must say and getting a
fair amount of product you're just kind
of running it back through there's one
thing I hate about brow pencils is like
worrying waxy brow pencils I hate them
this is just kind of almost that chalky
vibe but that's the the vibe that I like
so now I'm probably going to see the
real color because I don't have much
hair hair so I kind of just have to draw
it on it's slightly on the perp layer
warmer side so I'm sure if I'd gone into
store I probably would have picked a
better color I was impatient y'all I
wanted to get this video up for you guys
spend times of pigmentation and
application
I haven't had to twirl it up yeah and
there's still I feel like plenty left to
be able to complete this brow and then
I'll see when I get to the front I like
to further upwards firm brow pen so that
was pretty good I mean I'm twisting it
down and I just tried to twist it down
there and it's kind of like not going
down so I feel like maybe somewhere in
there it's like broken so I hope I've
not like up when I do the other
brow so in like I said the colors a
little bit warm for me and not
necessarily what I would have picked off
the back cuz I've now got slightly more
Ashley a turns through my hair probably
would have gone for a slightly more
cooler turn brown but the formula it's
really good I'm hoping I've not broken
in and I can still use it for yeah okay
I can still use it for my other brow
which I'm going to go ahead and do now
and then we can come back to finish the
skin with the new highlighting palette
and I am so excited for that because i
swatched it and it looks so good it
looks so good okay Brad time okay so I
just went ahead and did the other brow
looks really natural I think I love
grabbing micro brow pencils just to kind
of do a quick Brown that makes sense I
know this probably didn't seem like a
quick brow but like say I'm just going
to the gym I'm just like going out to
the shops or something browsers just
something I always will have time for
and micro brow pencil so Brad mint is
with us
thinner more precise tip I might go to
for that and yeah I mean the color
actually doesn't look as bad as I
thought it might as in warmth or
anything like that but I think I would
probably still pick up a more cool tone
one but as for the precision and the
formula it applied Breen I see and
really naturally and yeah I like the way
my brows look today so that's all that
matters okay so to finish up the skin
when I saw this online I was like oh my
god I'm gonna have to get that it's the
revolution Pro 4k highlighter palette
and this is in the Gold Edition now it
kind of reminds me of the layout of like
the hood of beauty highlighting palettes
and stuff this one doesn't contain any
creams though and they all are
highlighting shade which I kind of like
the Hoonah Beauty ones have a cream like
a blusher and bronzer highlighter shade
and then the classic a lighter shade so
this gives you a bit more to play with
in terms of powder highlights I want to
use as many as possible so I think I'm
gonna I think I'm just gonna mix them
all together I'm not gonna lie I'm gonna
mix all the gold colors together and
then possibly top with the white one and
just see how that goes so I'm gonna take
my a BH highlighting brush because
that's like my go-to one anyway so
that's probably the proper way to test
it I will say after just giving it a
swirl a lot of powder kind of does come
off of it it's just it's a palette that
kind of thing happens not too much fall
out anyway
so I've mixed the light gold the medium
gold and the yellow gold all together
I'm not gonna be applying a cream base
like I normally would I did think about
the illuminating drop as like a base but
then I kind of put up my hand and they
they kind of just blend into like a soft
highlight which is why I think they work
well just like in a foundation so I'm
just gonna go ahead and use the powder
straight off
can you see that oh my god I'm just
gonna take the light gold one and do
kind of like my Cupid's bow holy
 I just like to go with my Beauty
Blender though because when I look
forward I always like to see where it
hits and if I've taken a little bit too
far and I just blend that ow that's so
nice I will say a little bit powdery but
it all blends in beautifully I'm just
gonna take a slightly smaller precise
brush this is a multi m5 one one and I'm
going to mix that the champagne color
with the white and I'm gonna use that
down the bridge of my nose and the end
of my nose yeah a little okay a little
bit powdery I won't lie just gonna take
the white again and just top off what
I'd already done I probably will put
that in my inner corner as well after
I've done the eye shadow I will say
there's like speckles in my brows by
lips you just wiped them off and now
they're gone this is so nice I can't
remember the price of it though I don't
think it was too much I've linked it
down works it was definitely still in
stock and I know they do other colors of
this I feel like maybe if you sprayed
your brush with a fix plus you wouldn't
get that kind of loose powder glitter
thing that I had going on so maybe I'll
try that next time but my skin is
looking so good if I do say so myself
okay so do not get one in place firstly
I will probably do this at the end of my
makeup as well
I got the revolution Pro supreme hold
finishing spray I know they do like a
matte version and they probably if they
do a matte version do a duty version I
just got the supreme hold one cuz I
thought this is a bit more of a generic
one that anyone can use time to douse
the spray wasn't too much of a I feel
really like drenched but it was a nice
enough you know that I feel like it's
doing something so I'll let that kind of
soak in and sink in and will say no
nothing it's not like bad but I'm not
like a fan of the smell of
it smells a bit like clinical but it's
not like lingering or anything that is
gonna annoy me for the rest of the day
but we'll see how that works i mean i'm
i wanted to spray it now because I'm
under studio lights and I'm now gonna go
ahead and do my eye shadow which I feel
like might take a long time so I'm gonna
see how my skin kind of holds up and
lasts throughout this video while I'm
doing my eye makeup so I asked you guys
on Twitter what look you wanted to see
me do with this
this is their mischeif matte eyeshadow
palette so all of these are all really
super colorful matte shades I know
there's a morphe palette out there that
is full of colorful map shows which I do
have but it's how it's stopped all the
time and I think it's just because it's
nice to have just a matte colorful
eyeshadow palette in your kit so you can
do colorful looks if you want to and
like you have every single color there
if you need to so this I have linked
down below as well so I think I'm gonna
go ahead and do like one eye off-camera
just to play because I literally have no
idea what I'm doing and then come back
and do the other eye and show you how
they work and hopefully it's all good oh
we have come up with a little sunset
moment going on so let me show you how
to do it because you guys don't have a
colorful palette yet I definitely I'm
recommending this one already before I
even show you how it works so I'm gonna
go in with the yellow shade is our
initial transition color it's called new
day and I thought you guys appreciate it
when I tell you the brushes I'm using as
well so I'm taking a sigma e30 8
diffused crease brush and just buffing
this into the crease now this is gonna
be like our eraser shade I'm always
gonna dip back into this or pick up this
brush and use this to diffuse all other
kind of colors into each other so we're
taking it quite high up in the crease
next up on my Mac 2 1 7 I'm just taking
the orange shade next door called
daydream and again let you kind of in
the same placement I'm just gonna buff
that back and forth from inner corner to
outer corner you guys can see this
pigment right now I love a burnt orange
shade it doesn't matter so much if
you're getting the color on the on the
lid sorry because we're going to be
carving it out but like I said going
back in with the yellow making sure
still visible and really creating that
nice apricot blend almost that sounds
like a food I want to eat or a yogurt
flavor so again making my way down I'm
taking this cutter here this is more of
a red shade and this is called halftime
it's quite a like light brown if that
makes sense it's kind of a peachy pinky
red but it is still the only noticeable
like red in the palette so I'm just
taking that this is a zoeva 2 to 4 luxe
crease brush I like this because it's a
lot more flimsy and it kind of blends as
you go and again going back in with the
2 1 7 with the orange shade I didn't
actually pick up any initial orange just
then I'm just using the brush to diffuse
the red and then picking up the yellow
brush that we used the Sigma one I
haven't picked up any more products this
time but just using it as a like
diffuser as you can see so it just has a
effortless blend to it this is a zoeva 2
to 7 brush and i'm gonna take the color
underdog and wring lead it together so
basically the two Pink's underdog and
ringleader these are kind of more of the
two darker Pink's underdog he's more of
a cooler tone but ringleader is more of
that like peachy pink which I really
like I couldn't decide which one I
wanted to use so I'm gonna use both just
going into the crease and creating that
pink moment that we've got going on all
the way from inner corner to outer
corner we really want to create that
that sunset vibe now we're starting to
get a little more precision on with our
brushes this is as a way that 2 3 1 luxe
petit crease brush and I'm gonna mix the
two shades upper-hand which is the brown
and ricochet which is more of a grape
wine kind of color and just really work
that into the sucker like I said doesn't
matter so much if you're getting on the
lid we can easily carve that out so you
can kind of see peeks of like every
color that we've used but the final kind
of we are going to use and this
is a small tapered blending brush from a
Sigma is the e 45 the final color we are
going in with is this kind of here is
called haunted it is a dark purple so
we're gonna keep it warm
I really just press that into the socket
line
try not to blend that up too high like
so okay so now I'm gonna take a little
bit of that camouflage concealer back on
to my palette as you guys can see there
and I'm just gonna take a concealer
brush this is a BH Cosmetics brush which
I really really love and it's just the
number 9 I'm just gonna take a bit of
that concealer and carve out my crease
I'm now gonna take a flat brush this is
the short shader brush from Sigma is the
e 20 picking up that really bold yellow
shade called new day and again we're
gonna kind of do the same sort of
transition but not with as many colors
and but from inner to outer corners
yeah just packing that on and basically
covering up now any of the remaining
concealer or eye base because they're
the only really colors I'm gonna use on
the lid I'm vibing and loving this look
right now and then this is like my
favorite brush ever this is from zoeva
it's the 240 luxe petite pencil
literally look how tiny it is I'm gonna
take the champagne and the white from
the highlighter palette literally mix
them together on this little ditty brush
and really just enhance that inner
corner highlight and pop I'm now gonna
go ahead and apply a mascara and
eyelashes you can kind of see the finish
result on this side but I can't wait to
show you what they both look like
together and complete so let's go ahead
and do that ok so these are the finished
eyes by the way the lashes are Lily
lashes in the style ela I am in love
with this I think it looks is so pretty
uncoloured and really makes I thank and
compliment any eye color I've linked it
down below I feel like it's perfect for
festival season so the eyes are done the
skin are done let's just move on to the
lips we're gonna keep it simple guys the
eyes have enough drama going on
I picked up one of the Pro supreme matte
lip pigments in the color for Kate for
Sade for sale I feel like it's the same
looks like this little pro on the top
they're very wire sell so the
applicators just like this is just gonna
be a pale nude let's go guys
maybe I should have got him with a lip
liner to keep my lips a little bit more
definition but let's just go with like
the artistic vibe we have going on I'm
going to go in with a bit of the
highlighter give them it some definition
we'll just go with the artistic flow of
this I'm gonna zoom you out and show you
the finished look and give a final of
the settings bridge so this is the
finished look I'm gonna spray myself one
more time with the setting spray so far
so good with that foundation and the
base and everything like that of lasting
underneath all these lights while I was
doing my eyes which has taken me about
35 minutes under kind of a little bit of
heat right now but yeah let's go ahead
and spray again but this is the finished
look so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video definitely make sure to give
it a thumbs up if you did and let me
know in the comments down below if you
wanted me to do like a volume 2 of this
try out some of their other palettes
they keep coming out with new and newer
stuff so let me know if that's something
that you guys would want to see because
I know there was some bits I didn't pick
up
just cuz they weren't released when I
was purchasing on it this and I wanted
to get this video up for you guys
ASAP so yeah let me know in the comments
down below or just let me know by giving
me a big thumbs up because it means the
world overall I literally love
everything that I use I think it's come
out so well I know the price point is on
point for the quality of this stuff
which is again another reason why I
wanted to do this video to show you the
amazing quality you can get from a brand
new brand before you go in and pick it
up I know it's definitely I think in a
lot of Superdrug stores now so you can
go and have a swatch and play with all
this stuff take a little list down of
everything that I've used to swatch it
for yourself and you tell me what you
guys think of it as well so I hope you
enjoyed this video I hope you're having
an amazing day whatever day is that
you're watching this and I'll see
you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
