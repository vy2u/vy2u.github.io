sorry
today's tutorials a little bit different
but I really think that you guys are
going to love it so so much a little
taste there but hey guys welcome back to
my channel so today's video is gonna be
a little twist on the accent challenge I
think kind of kind of do the accent
challenge but a makeup tutorial so every
product I use I'm gonna try and do a a
different accent I have no way saying I
am incredible at accents you guys just
seem to love it when I do them and I
actually really love doing them and just
having fun with them no way meant to
offend anyone by this but a lot of the
accents I am doing are from different
areas in England I will say which
accents enjoin crime in the corner it's
just meant to be a little bit of fun
there's a little bit more casual today
it's pretty damn cold outside
I am repping my own merch if you guys
didn't know I do have merch is always
listed it down below
we actually got rid of a lot of items
thirty ones left are like phone cases
and this amazing marshmallow hoodie
which is literally my favorites the
softest thing ever so make sure to check
the link down below for that but before
we get started is notification a bell
shoutout ah yeah so in every video I'd
love to give a shout out to it you guys
that let me know that you've hit the
notifications bell after you've
subscribed all if you're just doing it
now so this week the notification
balance shout-out goes to Rebecca Elliot
that says notifications are on snapchat
fam as well love the videos yes so much
love for you Rebecca snap fam bells on a
true supporter I love ya so yeah if
you're excited for this video already
and make sure to hit the thumbs up
button I just did a really wearable go
to look for me cuz it was really about
the look it was more the accents use
some new and exciting products as well
which I've always enlisted it down below
so like without further ado should we
just totally get on with the video let's
get going
all real sort with one of my favorites
it's a Newcastle accent I love a gorge
accent I don't know why and it all seems
to come out and I'm pissed that I just
love speak like this so we're gonna
apply our primer this is the next total
control drop primer I love it looks a
little dodgy on me face but we'll get
over it and you guys know I always love
to use a brush makes it so much easier
to both and blend it in any skin I know
so many people that find the Geordie
accent so annoying but I love it
everything sounds so much better I don't
know I think it's just cuz I used to
watch a lot of Geordie Shore and then
always getting so Agee at each other but
it sounded okay in this voice all you
little ratchets out there looking for a
new primer this one is mint alright so
the next sacks um we're gonna be doing
this for Wales I'm gonna be doing my
foundation I'm not sure what part of
Wales I'm from when I'm talking like
this Emma from the valleys do I like the
shark sheep who knows I'm just using the
Loreal foundation stick or I Gwen how's
it going I love this stick I do it's got
a purposeful courage and we're just
gonna bounce it into our skin are we I
feel like that was reset
I'll always remember one thing in Welsh
that I heard was I was watching an
episode of the valleys and Leticia said
that she was gonna get a tattoo of a
sheep or a hoof and I always will
remember that something funny to say in
Welsh because if you're from Wales well
aren't you gonna get a tattoo of a sheep
on your food alright so now we're gonna
do our concealer and this is the makeup
revolution concealer it's been shade c7
and I just want to say that I love it so
much it's so good like oh my god I bang
on about how much I love this concealer
all the time but I'm telling ya babe hun
you've gotta get it if you haven't got
it yet you better go out and get it
honestly room it has such a thick
coverage but just blends like a dream
alright girls you see that no bags any
more bags
honestly I'm telling ya girls if you
don't know they go out and get it
because I love you
alright so now we're gonna move back
onto powder this as the RC amino colour
powder powder powder
I just like to use that to set my face
and please like that I'll literally
think this match the skin sure well and
you just need a wee bit to go out to go
along we just like to press it into my
skin make sure I've got that coverage
going on right the skin is looking slick
and sick so I think we can move on to
our eyebrows so for our eyebrows today
we're gonna be using an anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in the color dark
brown and you guys know the drill
just truce in the boredom with me brow
just using a lot of strokes also I'm
aware that there are many parts of
Ireland and I'm not sure which part of
Ireland this accent is I might be
dipping in out of a few parts of Ireland
but you just gotta bear with me and you
think I'd be good in Irish accent
because my surname is Larry and
somewhere down the line there's Irish in
me so as you can see I always just like
to do the tail of me borough just like
the end of a rainbow you know where the
pot of gold is and then lightly bring it
throw the front mimicking those hairs
I'm going off words just like that we've
got a perfect brow I'm just gonna go
ahead and doing the other eyebrow off
camera because this has taken a little a
little longer than I thought it would
and it's actually getting a little bit
difficult to do this Irish accent so I'm
gonna go ahead and match up the other
brow I won't be back to move on to the
next steps and continue with the face
oh I sue a browsers owner and we're
gonna be moving on to bronze at this as
the Anastasia Beverly Hills bronzer and
saddle now I'm not sure if this is
available yeah and the UK but when it is
available it's so nice I've always loved
doing a Scouts accent the best way to be
able to do a scout sucks and it's to get
a lot of saliva in your mouth and really
everywhere that's just sayin but I
really love the color of this I think
you're warms up the skin so nicely sorry
nice little nicely and it blends on like
a dream all right that's the blusher
done we can now move on to the no wait
that's the bronzer done now we can move
on to the but I think now we
could move out of the UK okay so for the
black shell we're going to be using I've
got a bad idea this is a palette from
Mac that I custom-made myself which you
can do that on their website they now do
different sizes of palette this one is a
six a shovel
a two cream color base 1 and a 2 blusher
1 so I won't be using it as a blush are
called Melba it is one of my favorites
it is a very soft pink elements of peach
in it it is a personal favorite because
it is very natural and it has it has a
more matte finish I just like to apply
that to the palms of my cheeks I also
can speak a little bit of French but it
is my French over exam from many years
ago
and it doesn't really make sense in this
situation but if you are French can you
tell me what I am saying actually the
motion curve I don't think a face of
Criminology Maria de Clare cleon's
Baskonia
I am the Megadeath a bone-in croissant
and I actually do not know if that still
makes sense but I give it my best shot
no oh ok so now to finish off the skin
I'm gonna be using a highlighter this is
the L'Oreal crushed foils metallic
highlighter in gilded glow I listed this
on my Instagram stories the other day
and so many of you guys were in love
with it and I actually have filmed a
skin tutorial that I'm gonna be posting
soon I did a little preview again on my
Instagram stories like the other day and
showed you guys this amazing skin that I
did and this is what I used so I'm gonna
go ahead and apply this I actually feel
like it works a little better if you
apply it with your finger and then I'm
gonna use a brush to a Buffett end but
oh my god it literally feels like butter
on the skin and it blends like a dream
so I'm just gonna put this on my
cheekbones and then a buff it in with a
brush like I can you not l'oreal did not
come to play with this new formulated
highlighter it'll literally is insane
like literally insane i know again it
does like different parts of America I
mean I could try and do new you up
gangsta but it doesn't always work and I
can't say a lot of things in it I think
I'm having a complete mind Lang and
can't think of any other American accent
right now and trying to think about
American programs that I watch like the
Real Housewives and the only one I can
think of it's like new
now let's is that nobody just did for
New York I don't even know but all I
know is that this highlighter is again
amazing I love it I have no idea which
part of America I'm talking from but I
love the American accent anyway and
every time I go to America they love my
accent so I feel like it's totally a
mutual thing and we're all just gonna
vibe about it and we could all just
appreciate this amazing glow that I have
going on on my skin right now okay so
the next part of the tutorial is gonna
be my eye shadow and that's gonna be a
kind of long part of this tutorial
because I'm just gonna be using one
eyeshadow palette which I'll go into in
a second so I thought I better pick a
accent that I can do really well and do
for a long time so I'm actually gonna go
ahead and do one eye off camera because
I have no idea what I'm gonna be doing
with it and then we can move on to the
eyes and possibly mine and yours
favorite accent that I love to do
okay so I've gone ahead and done one eye
off-camera and I'm gonna be taking the
makeup revolution chocolate orange
palette which looks like this oh my god
how good does that look
I'm so excited that you use it and I'm
just gonna make my way through the matte
shades in this and then kind of do a
half cut crease vibe kind of look so
when I was reading through the comments
on my Jamie video so many of you guys
said that you love it when I do accents
especially Australian accents and you
guys wanted me to do a following like an
Australian beauty gurus and makeup
tutorials like shiny grim and and stuff
like that and I do like to think that my
Australian accent does sound quite
natural because I did used to live there
but there's different parts of Australia
again like any place and the accents all
sound slightly different for example I
used to live in a Melbourne and their
accent can be a little bit different if
you watch The Real Housewives of
Melbourne you Lori it's a little bit
more like so I really can't be
this is a lot of it's a bit of a softer
tone in your voice
but I feel like this Australian accent
that I'm doing is just a little bit more
on the generic side of things I mean me
and my friends like to talk in an
Australian accent but really like lay on
the enunciation of words so we used to
always be like no no I'm not doing that
Noorie and just really get on each
other's tits oh my god
speaking of tits I am sorry I am sorry
happy that Jim a private school girl has
come back on TV because that makes me so
happy
like hearing that Australian accent and
that all being kind of like a piss take
of what private schools are like in
Australia and just whatever because I
didn't go to a private school but I went
to school in this a lot of similarities
like the uniform and the way they behave
and all that kind of stuff and Plus
Chris Lilley it's just a freakin genius
I feel like this was jolly Nexen might
be coming up a little bit like doll
because I'm kind of speaking so normally
with it but I'm trying to think of like
what a stereotypical Australian things
to say that would make you guys be like
haha my course truth might throw a
couple of shrimps on the barbie course
sure my did you hear that
Jonathan's later for Ripa this palette
is literally or just throw it perfect
for travelling because it's got that
massive mirror and it's got like
everything you need to create a look
like this and then we can just above eat
at we're just gonna be popping it out
mom I told you to come at 10 past three
for your sevens sorry
quiche aren't they just absolutely
what spitting all reet so I've run out
of accents so I'm go back and do some of
my favourite accents so this is the
Geordie accent so I'm just gonna be
lining my lips with the OCC lip liner in
a trick just realise you can't
talk when you're lining your lips so I
couldn't really do me Geordie accent so
I'll I'll keep it going while I do me
lipstick this is the jeffree star liquid
lipstick in I'm nude don't be scared by
how pale this is cuz I'm gonna put a
gloss on that's gonna get us ready to
look like we're ready to shock something
all right so now we're gonna finish off
using the l'oreal extreme resist lip
gloss and never let me go which is the
most gorgeous shimmery pinky lip gloss
which i thought would be okay i think so
for this look and it's gonna finish off
our lips to make this lip look slightly
less like a pig's anus and the only
accent opening to left is my own so I'm
wearing English girl I'm just gonna use
a setting spray to lock this one in
place
oh and that was the first tutorial so if
