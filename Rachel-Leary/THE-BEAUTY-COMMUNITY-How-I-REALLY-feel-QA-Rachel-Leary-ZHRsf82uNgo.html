today is kind of a slightly different
video recently just on my Twitter and
just my general feeds on social media
I'm seeing a lot of drama and I wouldn't
normally like speak about it or like
comment on it but it was just because a
lot of the terms thrown around were
saying everyone like everyone's fate
everyone everyone everyone and I'm
thinking no they're not so as someone
that is part of the beauty industry and
the beauty community I just wanted to
give my insights on it and love what's
going on and my honest opinions about
all sorts of stuff so I asked you guys
to ask me questions on Twitter by the
way when this video goes up I'm
currently in Los Angeles so make sure
you are following me on my socials to
keep up with what I'm doing I don't want
this video to be about makeup or
anything like that hence the bear face I
just wanted to answer your questions and
give you guys a little bit of insight so
don't think it's there for like a few of
big people's opinions to reflect on
everyone and then you feel like because
of some drama that's going on on one
side it's all the same that goes on on
the other side if you know what I mean
so I asked you guys to send me in your
questions and what are you reading
people's names ups I kind of just asked
you guys to ask me these questions so I
could kind of go off on what you guys
have to say so I'm just gonna scroll
down to the bottom of the list and just
go through them one by one so someone
asks have you ever worked with an
influencer that you didn't like in the
first place or didn't like them when you
met them so I always think when it comes
to work you've got to keep it
professional because this is your work
if you were in an office it's no
different if you paired with someone
that you didn't like you would just have
to suck it up and do it because at the
end of the day you want to do well and
if that means you have to work with
someone that you don't like to be able
to do well you just have to do it
fortunately on all the brand work that
I've done a lot of it is on my own in
the sense that I work from home and
brand content all that kind of stuff but
all the campaign's that I ever worked
for I have loved every person that I've
done it with I've definitely surrounded
myself with real positive people and a
lot of the people that I'm placed with
is because we've worked together on
campaigns so yeah dance that question no
I've never worked
and I don't like or have an opinion
change from working with them etc
someone said can you please explain at
the beef that's going on in the youtubes
at beauty community at the moment not
just anything up I feel like it's hella
confusing for so many viewers now and it
feels hard to watch videos because you
feel like you can't keep up and
sometimes with the beef it makes you
question whether you should be trusting
YouTube as you watch hopefully by
clearing out some of the beef it stops
us worrying that all / majority of
youtubers are fake and hard to trust
this is kind of the reason why I made
this video because that's exactly what I
don't want to happen I don't want you
guys seeing a friendships fall apart and
then you think oh my god does that mean
that's gonna happen with other people
and the way that they're going about and
what's happening to them does that go on
over here that kind of thing I don't
really want to particularly name and
names or name the drama because it's not
my thing to speak on but without
promoting these channels there are tea
spilling at channels that have commented
on them it's not yes necessarily
happening in the UK I will just say that
it's more the u.s. influences whenever I
come on Twitter and stuff there's
something like going on but the annoying
thing is everything in the America is
bigger
that's just like a known fact all of the
influences in America or the ones that
you probably watch have just such an
incredibly large following such a huge
platform and therefore anything that
they do or that goes on for them
unfortunately for them is just so much
bigger and like the scale that is so
much bigger like if I fell out with
someone you probably wouldn't even know
about it and it probably wouldn't even
be commented on whereas for them they
have millions and millions of people
watching them that want to know that
gets so engaged with their friendship so
when something does happen everyone is
suddenly a detective and they know it
and I can't imagine what that feels like
to have people like millions millions of
people commenting on your friendships
and telling you who you shouldn't
shouldn't be friends with people
speculating all sorts and it's like you
want to just be completely honest and
say this is what's going on never ever
there but there needs to be a line with
the one thing that does upset me is the
fact that these people that are having
the drama they are adults adults a lot
older than me
think I'm 21 and I feel like a lot of
the drums going on it's like with grown
people but they almost have to like the
way that they act and stuff has to be
kind of toned down in a way that's
understandable for their audience which
is very young so it's really hard
because if they weren't in the public
eye or anything like that they probably
wouldn't deal with certain situations
the way that things are going on and if
Twitter wasn't a thing and liking tweets
wasn't a thing just little things like
that that would start drama and stir the
pot like that stuff wouldn't be going on
but we live in such a young generation
of like technology and all that kind of
stuff and people like younger younger
gang into the online well and stuff it
gets it gets a lot you know and the
thing is when it comes to it trusting at
these youtubers and stuff it's again
hard to tell until unless they told you
exactly what was going on so you have to
make that decision for yourself
obviously dubby rumors going around that
so-and-so used Center for this and so
and so so you so and so for that so you
think oh my god if they can use and fake
friendships then what else are they
faking to me whether it be their opinion
on a product and all that kind of stuff
so I totally understand why you would
question it but again you just have to
think if you really love that person and
you've been following them from the
beginning and you've bought things from
in the past and all that kind of stuff
and you trust their opinion the fact
that they've fallen out with someone it
shouldn't affect that if that makes
sense
friendships and business that's why
people say you shouldn't really mix them
together because they are totally
different things so I feel like if
you've been following someone from the
beginning you should be able to trust
them friendships come and go but your
loyalties should always remain someone
said to me do you think YouTube in the
beauty industry is a good job career
this is a really really hard one in the
sense that I think a hundred percent yes
this is like the best thing that's ever
happened to me I am it so so it's so
blessed that this is my full-time job
and creating content you guys love
whether it be makeup tutorials and all
that stuff and I can get paid to do this
and you guys are loving it and I'm
loving it like that seems like a dream
world right but there is just
so so much more well it'll make sense
it isn't your classic nine-to-five job I
could be just about to go to sleep and
it's like 11:00 p.m. and I've got a
brand campaign with an American brand
and then they suddenly message me
because of the time difference that I
have to do something I can't just go I'm
not working so I'll just do it in the
morning because there isn't really like
a schedule you just kind of have to do
things there and then as when people
need it there's a lot of going back and
forth in this industry there's a lot of
brand campaigns that fall through so you
could be promised a whole ton of money
and it just gets dragged away from you
like that and then you're thinking
how the hell am I going to be paying for
something something this month when
that's just happened you know what I
mean so it's hard it's the best industry
if things work out you and you become
successful you become big enough that it
can become your career you're making
enough money and people want to work
with you that's when it's great but
sometimes I get scared what when you let
you have to be so thick-skinned but if
you're kind of person that if someone
said something to you that was kind of a
little bit harsh and like it upsets you
for like a few days and you really hold
on to it I wouldn't recommend even
trying out 100% just stick to creating
makeup looks and videos as your hobby
because once you make this your
full-time career I'm assuming you're at
a level where you're following is big
enough and all that stuff you are gonna
get a lot of negative comments not
everyone is gonna like you and when it
comes to your day to day life without a
big following that doesn't really matter
to you so much you don't hear what
everyone that says about you but this is
literally you could post a picture of
your makeup and someone says you look
 and then the next comment
and the next one the next woman and when
you have millions and millions of people
watching you that's like thousands of
but people that might not like you if
you think of it like that there's so
many pros but there is cons same for
like most jobs but I feel in this
industry it's just on a lot of a bigger
more competitive scale competition in
this industry is also a big thing so if
you can't handle that people might grow
faster than you and you might be it
stuck in the same position for ages
someone that you're really good friends
with this engagement is 10 times better
than yours you can't let that get into
go ahead and affect your friendships
because that's when you'll fall out and
that's when you'll stop driving yourself
literally in sane being on social media
as a full-time job you got you don't
stop you sometimes you're on your phone
at constantly and that can affect your
friendships in real life with people
that don't understand er if you're
always sat there doing something in your
eyes you're not really doing anything
you're just talking with the people that
follow you and rule over that but for
someone that sat opposite you that's
like your real life friend and they just
want to talk to you and you're just
going mm-hmm yeah they're gonna start to
get pissed off at you I know for a fact
that's happened to me in my real life
people getting pissed off at me being on
my phone all the time but that's
something that I am in trying to stop
yeah I do think it is a good career if
you enjoy the creative side of it you
love creating content me like talking to
a camera and you feel confident and you
love technology and the social side of
it and you love meeting new people then
a hundred percent this is a great job to
maybe try and get into but if you're
quite thin skinned you can't handle
criticism you can't deal with the non
certain see of deadlines and that kind
of thing then I probably wouldn't
recommend it but I would 100% say if
you're thinking about it go for it
because like what's the worst that could
happen someone said to me what are some
of the things that annoying you at most
about the industry I think what annoys
me most is that a lot of people get put
into the same category which is kind of
what spurred me to do this video it's
just because some people saying like
someone's fake better than everyone you
go watch your back then it like that's
not applied to everyone I feel the UK in
the US are kind of different there's
really really not that much drama in the
UK that I'm hot or that I'm aware of
take it upon myself to surround myself
with a positive people that are similar
to me I feel like I can be myself around
yeah I think that annoys me the most
that when one person says something like
you instantly think it applies to
everyone that's not true
but then on another side what annoys me
about the beauty industry is kind of
when people jump on the bandwagon that
you look at people are like expected to
be friends just because we do the same
thing like know that
this isn't like that's not really how it
is just because you might watch me and
I'm like your favorite person to watch
was and then you watch somebody else and
they're your favorite person to watch
and like you think we should therefore
be friends I'm not gonna force myself to
be friends with anyone but I would say
I'm quite a for any person Antoni open
to talking to everyone and it makes me
smile when people tweet me and say oh my
god don't and don't know you're at the
same event I do a video and there but
then you wouldn't know that that people
might not get on you know so that's the
kind of two things i annoy me one when
people one person's drama and
characterize it and apply it to everyone
know and to when people expect two
people to be friends just because they
do the same thing and also three when
people think that paid content is paid
content and that's all it is it's not my
real opinion or anything like that I
wouldn't accept the paid content if I
didn't want to do it and majority of the
time you guys follow me you know the
paid stuff that I do in this was like
Maybelline and sleek and L'Oreal
something like that and they are all
brands I regularly use therefore why one
would I turn it down because it's like
an actual dream come true that a brand
that I freaking love wants to pay me to
do something and to to them Whitewater
lie about it I'm already using it
therefore but what what's the lie you
know so those three things annoy me
anyways someone said have you ever been
betrayed by someone or had any two-faced
encounters if so what would they like um
yes not betrayed but I've definitely had
some two-faced encounters before
literally as like what it says on the
tin like someone's been completely nice
to my face but nice oh babe it's fine
and then gone behind my back and just
like twisted my words or like said
something totally different I definitely
had that before and it's like come back
to me and you just think like where did
you get that from why did you do that
and honesty but that's the kind of thing
so I'm the kind of person where like I
just have to think to myself okay I
don't see you every day I don't talk to
you everyday things like banning me but
 like this happened I just think to
myself I you're not part of my everyday
life so the situation you're now
creating it's really not that big of a
deal I don't care I'm not like really
gonna hold it against you I'll be
wearing it in the future but really I'll
see the bigger picture like life's too
short to hold on to things I love people
that you can just move on with you know
like a little tickle about something you
talk about it and you move on they're
like my favorite kind of people because
that's how the world's gonna go around
but I've never been betrayed by anyone
someone said how do you feel about the
major change in the YouTube beauty
community now compared to how it used to
be when it was it was genuine girls the
flash guys doing for fun not to be known
this is what's making me really really
upset at the moment because I'm sure
you're fully aware the videos that are
doing well on YouTube are clickbait and
it's more reviews it's more like worth
the hype it's more those kind of things
the old school makeup tutorials that
made these people get so big and that's
definitely what made me get my following
was makeup tutorials just the
bog-standard makeup tutorials where you
watch someone transform and just glam
and just I miss them so much I don't
give a about these like clickbait
videos because I'm watching it for 30
seconds and you've shown me this the
thing that was in your thumbnail and and
that was it do you know what I mean I
missed the authentic growth from just
your own talent so it really upsets me
because this then makes engagement
people go down because utricle promoting
those kind of videos and you guys
getting sucked into like oh my god the
worst foundation ever and it's only bad
because they just didn't apply a primer
right or they just did it really thickly
or they did it to deliberately make it
look bad like is that really what you
want to be watching that's not what I
want to watch I want to watch genuine
yeah I want to watch genuine people
create art on their face and show me
these amazing products that they're
using sure if you use a product and it's
bad and you don't want to buy it and you
like you and you want to do a video on
it then like do a video on it but like
do you really have to be on against the
thumbnail and all this kind of stuff but
why is that become what everyone wants
to
I'm so like confused and the annoying
thing is if you want to grow you have to
go with what's popular but like a part
of me just really doesn't want to do
that but you'll notice my channel has at
least half a million of you guys here
which I am so grateful for but some
people have half a million and they get
like a hundred thousand views on each
video that's a fifth of their audience
engaged I get like 25 to 50,000 views on
a video that's like 1/10 and below and
it makes me like sad because I think
what am I gonna have to start doing
these videos in order to get you guys
engaged and to grow with me and to get
more people to come to my channel I want
to stay authentic but you just know it
make it does make me sad and it can be
kind of discouraging and I miss the old
videos that I used to watch from some of
my favorite people that now don't do
those kind of videos anymore sorry that
was really like an aggressive a few a
minute anyway someone said do you think
people who review their friends and new
beauty products of being a genuine about
their impressions I would hope so I know
if my friend created a product and they
sent it to me and I tried it and I
didn't really like it if they were my
friend I just wouldn't do the video do
you know I mean I don't I don't know I
probably wouldn't I don't know if I'd
say anything I'd want to give them like
constructive criticism and stuff but I
just wouldn't do a video on it because
then that would an especially if it was
a negative one because then that would
just go true that I was literally just
doing it to get abused you know I mean
because you think that my friend but I'm
about to slag off their product like so
it depends if it's like a negative
review on their friends thing depending
on the scale of it then maybe like I
would more believe that opinion on the
product rather than their friendship but
know if it's a positive one and they're
their friend by all means I would
believe it they're doing it on camera so
you can kind of see for yourself so yeah
I would do I would hope that if they
were filming with their and their
opinion was positive that would be
because they genuinely enjoy the product
and that person is their friend someone
said do you ever feel pressured to put
out more videos to keep up with other
Beauty influences as in less quality
more in a quantity love you levy - and
that's kind of what I was going to
before it's not necessarily like more
content but so what content like
I don't know like I I started my channel
like two years ago and it's at one point
I was gaining like ten thousand
subscribers a week like roaming so so
quickly and now more and more people are
doing and the content is completely
different everyone's gone in a
completely different direction the
people that were going up a kind of now
not you know I mean so it's hard you
really do if you want to grow you need
to follow the trends I guess but it's
hard when you just want to stick to
doing what you're doing I hope you guys
like understand what I mean let me know
in the comments down below your thoughts
on this have you ever felt insecure
either when you first started at any
point due to the pressures of social
beauty standards a hundred percent yes
especially when you go on influencer
trips
oh my god I can't explain the anxiety
that I get if it's in the summer and I
get invited to go on a trip and it means
being in a bikini and all of that kind
of stuff and surrounded by these girls
that are like absolutely like a model
material just makes you feel really
insecure sometimes I'm gonna actually
like not a tear in mind why I'm just
getting really like passionate about
this video and yeah obviously you're
staring at yourself in a mirror like so
many hours of the day whether it is just
filming or you're doing makeup or ever
and it's so hard not to pick out the
insecurities in yourself and like when
I'm sorry and when you get comments all
the time and saying you should do this
you should do that like it is really
hard and like yeah you if anything this
industry makes you feel ten times more
insecure than you were already because
you've got thousands and thousands and
thousands of people feeling that they're
entitled to their opinion on you and you
just kind of have to sweep it under the
rug but it's hard sometimes I obviously
thoughts on influences buying views
likes on insert do you know anyone who
does this I don't know anyone like
personally I think I know how to tell
cuz obviously they might have a hundred
hundreds and hundreds and thousands of
followers and then they post a video and
it only gets like 20,000 views you have
five hundred thousand followers and what
only twenty thousand people are seeing
like there's either the Instagram
algorithm I know it is kind of
but like it must be really really
or they're not really your followers and
that's just a number that's being shown
it's not real people that care and that
are engaging with you so that's kind of
how you can tell it's the same with
pictures if someone's buying likes and
there's like 20,000 likes in a picture
and then it's like it's like 20 coins
that doesn't make sense and I think that
is fake because if a brand is kind of
unfortunately a lot of brands do just
look at your numbers and they think yes
then one work with then they've got the
look they've got the following done and
then I'm like working with them too and
we're getting paid the same amount why
the hell is that fair they paid for
their following I grew mine
authentically but we're getting paid the
same what so that kind of thing like
does piss me off but no I don't know
anyone personally that does that someone
said is there anyone you don't like in
the beauty industry are there any girls
who are the complete opposite in person
as opposed to their videos name and
Trainmen I'm not going to name and that
shame because I feel like that's almost
a form of but him but I said anyone that
I don't like in the beauty industry yeah
are there any girls who are complete
opposite in person as opposed their
videos yeah a lot of people do this is
the thing you meet when it's just me and
a camera I could be like no no no but
cuz I'm on my own
and I'm not around other people I'm not
being embarrassed by something and
there's not other factors affecting me
and therefore when you're put in a
situation where there's loads of people
around you but you're very loud on
camera and then yeah you meet and you
you are surrounded by other people in
person and you're just like that's
totally normal but then that would then
imply that you were totally different on
camera than you are in real life and
I've had that a few times I've met
people where they're very loud and
whatever on camera and then you meet
them in real life and it's very and it's
just so okay like I'm wanting to go out
you can be like oh my god hi there and
I'm thinking you're gonna reciprocate
and then you don't and then I'm they're
like great I feel embarrassed now and
then it can be because of that that I've
realized okay maybe we're just not
get on you're not the person I thought
you were and that doesn't matter I'm
sure they didn't give a about my
opinion I'm planning to keep my opinion
to myself I'll just keep a mental note
like okay we're not meant to get on and
then there's some people that just
choose to dislike you
and but like not tell you about it and
tell but then take it upon themselves to
tell other people that they don't get on
with you and so you're just kind of left
in the dark you're trying to reach out
to them and they're ignoring you and
you're thinking like what like why lie
down or anything like that and they are
the worst kind of people they're the
ones that I don't trust especially if
it's happening to me and you've implied
that you're my friend and then I try and
talk to you and you completely blank me
or something like that and then you're
telling other people that you don't like
me that's that's school behavior that's
really really petty and that's just
nothing that I can get on board with and
so that's not because we don't see each
other all the time or anything like that
but again I'm just gonna take that on
board you don't talk to me fine we'll
leave it like that you have to grow up
quite quickly in this industry that's
the last thing I'll say before we wrap
this video up you're forced to grow up
quickly whether it comes to dealing with
money your finances people's behavior
you have to adjust very quickly and
understand that not everyone's mind
works the way that your stars and as
soon as you do that they're happier and
more content you'll be and you can apply
that to your everyday life too so that
is the end of this video I hope you guys
