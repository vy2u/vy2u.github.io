of November and we are vlogging because
today is probably one of the most
exciting days ever as you guys will
already know by now today I'm traveling
to Los Angeles with Anastasia Beverly
Hills and also Phil Unni because
Anastasia Beverly Hills is large you can
feel unique which is so exciting for us
people here in the UK they're obviously
other places that you can get it but
this is just gonna be another one so
there's no excuses now we can all play
the make up game yeah I'm just waiting
for my car to come and get me and then
we're heading over to the airport where
I'm gonna see Gary and Sophie we're all
going on this trip together I am a so so
so excited I feel like this is gonna be
the trip of a lifetime
I'm here with I'm Gary and we're just
ripping in and I'm awaiting 1318 to come
and then we can ready to go or if you
just have to make a quick breakfast stop
when it's we come up with a plan of what
we won't do for like this someday
as we have a completely free day so
we're going to try and like to go
everywhere it's gonna be so much fun but
now we have we're just kind of waiting
to board so for the next time I vlog to
be
what's interesting
we're here we're in our rooms tonight
really quite a boring night because it's
the evening time we're just probably
gonna get some food and then literally
crash and burn because we're such a type
I thought obviously I'm gonna give you a
lot of room talk so here we've got our
bathroom very spacious and there's like
the biggest narrow which is always a
bonus and then you come round into here
and we've got the biggest bed oh my god
you can watch yourself have a shower God
but yeah like I said tonight we're just
gonna be a chilling and having dinner
having a little wonder round so if
there's anything interesting obviously I
would take you along with me for that
but tomorrow we have a completely free
day of like exploring LA and going
shopping and stuff so I've really can't
wait for you guys to come along with me
for that I'm gonna be editing some days
of video which should obviously already
be up so I'll insert a card here for
that video because it would be a really
interesting one it's kind of like my
thoughts and feelings on beauty
community and just kind of mighty on all
of it so don't forgive that a lot yeah
without further ado I'm gonna get myself
ready and eat something I'm fucking
starving
anybody else literally have to unpack
everything like I always put all my
brushes in cups and like put all my
little eye products and cups and like my
lip products and cups everything just
has to be laid out otherwise I don't
feel complete Holly
morning guys is now the next day it's
really kind of early I'm gonna wait for
two hours but it's not like seven a and
I'm just editing a Sunday's video which
is the honest Q&amp;amp;A which will already be
up by now and I would have probably
linked it in this video somewhere but
the exciting my roots I'm always so
basic when it comes to food I let you
just get a look at that
scrambled eggs sausages better hash
brown cross some tea orange juice but
this does mean just fine just to finish
getting ready I'm already running a
little bit late I had a little bit of
drama when it came it to my videos it's
all good we're now going to have a full
day of exploring I think going to the
Hollywood sign and all that stuff I keep
saying that going to the Hollywood sign
and loads of those are fun stuff so I
can't wait to show you
guys look at these sweets they're like
little love bites stop kissing frogs men
are pigs
plenty of fish ain't that the truth
back at the hotel now oh my god I did
quite a bit of damage today so give this
video a thumbs up if you want like an L
a whore I did quite the damage in
Sephora I got a new coat some stuff from
a Sorella boutique so yeah let me know
if you guys want a haul I'm sure a lot
of you getting more bits over the
dripper anyways tonight we are going out
to dinner we're going to such a cool
restaurant but I have been to before
that probably would have been in like a
Knicks LA vlog it's basically the
coolest Russian is called oh my god
what's it called I can't remember I
remember comment but um I'll probably
when I get there I'll be filming it
anyway literally every meal is like a
piece of art last time I got a steak and
it came it's like a 3-foot giant fork
coming out of it honestly it is so cool
so I can't wait to show you and my there
but I'm just chilling for a little bit
now cuz you've got like an hour and a
half before we need to go down stairs
and chill and relax and then I'm gonna
start maybe doing a little bit of makeup
so I'll show you what I do for that so
this is the look for tonight and I just
read called my hair and it actually
applied a bit of makeup I got from
Sephora today so this is a little sneak
preview of the whole of I do it I
actually picked up the NARS foundation
again it's the all day luminous one I
don't like
rediscovered my love for it I picked up
in a different shade this is in the
shade it's Syracuse I use the shade
Stromboli before and it was just a bit
too yellow this one has a bit more of a
like warmer undertone to which I really
appreciate so got that on and then I'm
also wearing a lipgloss from a glam glow
it's just like one of their plumping
ones I can't remember the shade that we
find out if this one is the plump
plumper a just gloss plumping lip
trimming treatment in the shade casting
couch oh my god
I'm obsessed I think this is gonna be
like my new a favorite nude plumping
gloss yes now we're just heading out to
dinner to the really funky restaurant so
I can't wait to show you that's the name
of the restaurant guys that's why I
couldn't remember

of the mountains right now excited

this is dark but I want to have a
guideline okay so everything I'll hide
the outer area I tweeze off is amazing
and everything inside you say where you
filled it

incredible experience ever I feel like I
learn so much about eyebrows like I'm
not even kidding but now we're here at
altar I'm going to a bit more shopping
and then we're going out for dinner with
Anastasia Beverly Hills and the team

just going shopping now and then dinner
later I'm so excited we are back at the
room now just gonna get ready for the
dinner I spend way too much once again
literally from altar and then oh my god
I'm going to show you the anastasia
beverly hills stuff because so I got the
prism palette the couple of blush kits

Mexican dinner with Anastasia Beverly
