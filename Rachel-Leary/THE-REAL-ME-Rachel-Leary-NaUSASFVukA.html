this is obviously a bit of a different
video there is no music there's gonna be
no editing except just at the beginning
there I sat down because I really did
 around for about two minutes and I
put a voice to the video cuz me video is
only meant to be like 10 minutes long
but today I'm gonna do the stripped-down
challenge which from what you guys
tweeted me is basically not necessarily
like a response video but it was made
after that whole I don't want to
mispronounce the name
essena o'neill she was like a massive
like healthy lifestyle Instagram social
media person and then she suddenly quit
saying that it was already fake you only
see what she will see wanted to let you
guys see if that makes sense saying she
was like starving herself and posing for
these things and stuff like that equals
a bit of controversy because I think
obviously some people would agree in
some people wouldn't so in my opinion
not that I've liked just from the year
or so that I've been doing kind of
social media I've never really been in a
situation where I thought what I'm doing
is not legit like I think that sounds
like a really weird kind of thing to say
but she was saying stuff like she was
starving herself that day for a picture
cuz she was in like she did like bikini
and sportswear and stuff I've never ever
been in a situation where I felt like
I'm so uncomfortable doing this I'm so
unhappy doing this this isn't real this
isn't me not necessarily not saying that
the situation will never present it
sucks like I said I've only been doing
this for about a year or so and
obviously I guess you must have been
doing it I'm not much longer time but
yeah I'd like to think that on camera
and in my videos I'm as much as I am
myself as I would be able at me in real
life I mean the types of videos I do
being makeup tutorials and stuff there's
only a certain amount of personality I
can portray because obviously I'm just
kind of telling you tips and stuff on
how to do your makeup I can't exactly
while I'm doing that video show you that
you know I'm a 19 year old girl that
loves you know gang
you know junk and stuff with friends and
now you know and stuff like I can't
portray that side of myself in a makeup
tutorial which is why I always like
doing these chatty ones because I get to
show my personality a lot more so I yeah
they kind of put when you do more chatty
videos you can't ever putting yourself
out on the line a bit more but it makes
it so much more fun when I meet you guys
in real life because I've met so many of
you when I've been like out in town like
drunk and it's the funniest thing like
because that's who like I am like it's
like two friends meeting you know when
you're just like oh my god you're bad
and it's like it's it's fun and
obviously I only really will get to be
able to show that side if I ever really
meet you in person like I can't be like
that in front of the camera 24/7 which
is why I admire people that daily vlog
because you really do put your
personality out on the line and like
that's why I think a lot of people get a
lot of hate and stuff which is a shame I
mean not everyone's gonna get on in the
world you're not gonna like everyone's
personality so when that's side starts
to come out scary you know but yeah I've
got my opinion on the whole Instagram
social media type thing I think what she
said was fair enough and I can see some
valid points I don't necessarily think
it applies to everyone so to kind of
pinpoint it on like everyone that does
it as a living I think was a bit far
because perhaps they have not really
come across that but yeah so I don't
know what to talk about the rest the
video I guess I would just kind of talk
about my life let's do that I'm just
gonna go through like stage of my life
and that might have like affected Who I
am this person maybe but yeah so when I
was like one I actually lived in
Australia for four years and from what I
recall or just from the memories that
I've got I am like desperate to go back
I love Australia so much it's hot
obviously like majority of the time
everyone that is so nice it's the most
picturesque place ever the food looks
incredible like I'm fully I'm subscribed
and I follow so many
Australian like bloggers and and
ceramics and stuff and it just makes me
so sad but it's actually getting to the
point now where I think I've got like
loads more time for myself and that is
definitely on my list as a place to go
back and travel cheeks I still have
family that live there Hey but yeah um
so I live today I was about four and
then came back to England and then I
kind of moved around a lot and I was
actually I've been quite lucky in my
life to travel to a few like actually is
fu like I've travelled loads of places
but it was all when I was quite young
because of my dad's job it was also of
in like international business
development for stuff so a lot the time
we moved around moved house got to go
travelling a lot which was really fun
and then I went to school I went to two
primary schools and then I went to my
secondary school I don't know I should
say why one oh yes sir I went to George
other um so that might give you guys an
idea if you're from that area you might
know where that is you might know people
that go that or you might go there but
yes I went to Georgia and I don't really
know how to describe my school
experience like it wasn't bad but it
wasn't amazing like the last few years
of school I'd say like I was know I
guess like but I've died I really don't
know I wasn't like you know what the
word is I feel like a lots of people
didn't like me and like the last two
years or three years of school I don't
know if it was just because I was kind
of in that group of school they probably
didn't like I want to say and um like in
my yearbook and stuff I got voted all
the one so like biggest ego and so
stuff like that like I always I got like
in year 11 I got voted most vain you
know you think like I I don't personally
see myself like that so it was a bit
and that's why I just felt severely just
liked in school not my like my friends
but just like people that you kind of
passed in the corridors I've been in
your year like whatever you get just
when you get voted and like you get told
oh my god you're like the only person
that got voted in that category so you
were gonna be the only winner it's like
wow like my whole year I pretty doesn't
like me and it's funny because I see
people out these days that I know didn't
like me and I just singing my praises
and stuff and I think that happens to a
lot of people and you start like doing
something different and you put yourself
on the line and everyone takes the mick
obviously I start doing YouTube and I
was like in my kind of last years of
school as well so you can imagine like
if I walked into a room or into like my
common room and stuff like I'd get
comments all the time and when I had
like no subscribers and so people
weren't taking it seriously and then
it's like - obviously like I got more
subscribers and stuff and like my
teachers were asking me about it and I
couldn't wait to leave and I was the
point where everyone was deciding
whether or not to go to uni as well and
I thought to myself do I take a year out
and just see where it goes
or do I like apply teeny I'm so so happy
that I took the air up because it's now
in a couple of weeks gonna be my
full-time job and I think that's like
it's on like thinkable but I never ever
thought that what happened to me ever
I'm so blessed for all of you like I'm
not even kidding
but yeah it's some people still don't
understand and will always not
understand and still will take the piss
cuz it's just not I'm not it's not like
a normal job ready is it like to be like
oh sorry like I can't come out today
I've got to like take three pictures for
Instagram and fill the video but like
it's deadlines you're still doing
deadlines you're still working and stuff
like I just don't think people actually
get it but I look definitely not more
recently my friends especially take it a
lot more seriously and they like really
understand but yeah I don't really like
I've now been I'm not been through any
like massive on my good touchwood it'll
look something massive issues in my life
that would affect me I'll be worth
talking
out I guess I can only talk about what
do you guys what we want to know about
like relationships and stuff probably I
don't know what to say it's like 9
minutes 30 but I feel like I'm not ready
to talk about anything interesting we'll
talk a bit more um so in school I think
I only really had one or two maybe
serious ish boyfriends like there
weren't a hundred percent serious like
I've never it was quite it was just more
like important people that I was like on
and off with a long period of time one
was in like yeah it was probably like
between year 8 and year 10 maybe I can't
really remember uh it was like a really
nanak toxic relationship oh my god that
because I really liked him it like you
know it's someone just repeatedly does
things to really hurt you sound like
that actually when I think about it I
bring I'm never really been like a
massively affectionate person like my
friends would tell you that tell you
that then I'm gonna you know well you
know I mean like my friends would agree
that's my me my friends would agree I'm
not really a massive the affectionate
person like everyone always used to joke
a little ritual half stone type thing
but like the thing is I'm just very very
to myself sometimes I'd rather just like
be with myself like some days if I've
had like a really hectic day or
something I literally want to come home
and talk to no one I just want to like
sit in silence like I really just can't
find the energy to talk and like I don't
know if that really like affects the
fact that like I said like I've never
really had a serious relationship I've
never been able to fully give myself to
someone I mean I'd say besides this
serious issue toxic their their first of
a proper boyfriend that I had when I was
younger that's only ever really been to
like really important people in my life
one of them is not really so much in my
life anymore which is a shame oh yeah oh
my god this is like so going oftentimes
like I read it on 12 bucks I don't know
who the hell watches my videos these
days yeah
personality-wise I might seem really
like confident and happy and bubbly and
most the time I am but I can be a very
very like cold person in the sense that
I could I can like cut people just like
out of my life if I just realized that
you're not really bringing me any
positivity or you're making me happy or
anything like that I can quite easily
just cut you how is that make sense and
that's not actually nothing to be proud
of you like the fact that you could just
like drop someone from your life just
kind of make sure you really think about
everything in makes you think like well
you really don't want to be the last
place and stuff but sometimes things
have to be done yeah I don't I don't
know like I'm a very cop I can be a very
cold person but you know and you just
know one day I have like oh my god I
want to see going off on such a really
deep tangent about stuff that I don't
really even thought about you know it's
like I've never I've not met someone
kind of yet I don't think that has been
a hundred percent wanting to be with me
therefore I'm resorting like me I like
100% wanting to be with them it's like
I've never really given myself fully to
anyone but yeah I think that's a lot of
deep personal issues of just like being
not confident in myself and like always
I've always been a very self-conscious
person with like way and just appearance
and stuff and that's why I'm like trying
really hard at the moment it's just like
thought man I found just be
happy with everything for work because
there's so many things like bright in my
life at the moment you know
I just want to take all the boxes I know
like it's like nothing really that
possible to be like 100% happy with
everything in your life because there's
so much stuff that's like that's not
good in my life but at the moment the
positive 100 cent where you thought the
negative and there's just so many things
I just want to just deal with that I'm
not in the past and I feel like this
video doesn't make any sense I've
literally just been rambling but I want
you guys to kind of get to know me more
as a person so yeah I think I want to do
a lot more these type of videos like
maybe like 50 facts about me or like do
more Q&amp;amp;A s where you guys can ask me
more personal questions I can answer
I think that would be really good yeah
it's now coming up to 50 minutes this
video is only meant to be 10 minutes I'm
pretty sure it was event to be about
like my opinions on Instagram and
YouTube in the real side to it all but I
don't think you really want to know
about that like everyone says the same
thing like we show you what we want to
show you you don't see everything but I
desperately want to like show you guys
so much more of my life like daily
blogging still kind of scares me and I
don't do enough to like make it
interesting but like I love these funny
videos and I like sitting down and
talking and I want you guys to kind of
see the side of me so when you meet me
in person you you know exactly what I'm
going to be like because that's the one
thing that terrifies me is meeting you
guys in person you thinking I'm
something else and I'm like let your
expectations down like the amount of
times I've seen people I'd say I've not
been like 100% myself that day and like
maybe I said something oh I wasn't like
a hundred sent me and I and you might
felt I wasn't interested but I would
never want that to happen so obviously
like everyone's human and as I hope you
guys would understand if like I wasn't
myself you said all she obviously
probably wasn't herself she's not being
fake that makes sense but yeah like
these type of videos and just me kind of
explaining my personality and like sides
of me and just like stuff I just feel
like kind of connects us more wow I
really am rambling it's early I'm
I think I'm done I guess I hope you guys
enjoyed this video of my actual rant
this is just me as a person I honestly
ramble if I'm nervous or uncomfortable I
just word from it I do that a lot too
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video give it a thumbs up if you did
give it a thumbs up or leave comments
down below if you can relate to anything
that I've said about being like a stone
but also having a lot to give like what
am I talking about honestly I really
don't know but yeah I love you guys so
much and until next time all one's next
time Tuesday I'll see you in Tuesday's
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
