was deciding on what to thunk today and
I was going to the comments on my
previous video my get ready with me
video and loads of those of you who had
also tweeted me as well thing that
you've really enjoyed kind of seeing my
personality come through a bit more
because that was a bit more of like a
relaxed type video so I thought
obviously as you can tell by the title I
would film the TMI tag so I can I google
dit and I've come up or haven't come up
with oh there's like a set of questions
I think there's like 50 so I'm just
gonna go through them and answer them as
honestly as I can okay so the first
question is what are you wearing I am
currently just wearing this white body
suit from boohoo maybe and some grey
trousers from pretty little things I've
just been to the cocoa brown a pen in
London so I've kind of wanted to keep
quite casual so yeah that's what I'm
wearing
ever been in love no I don't think so I
think you know what that's like and you
know you know and I don't know so no I
had a terrible breakup um yeah but I
think now I think about it it wasn't
that terrible but I think at the time I
was like like life or death it's over
but so yeah I think so but like ah I see
favorite how tall you and I think I'm
like five foot five or five foot form no
doing on that small 5 foot 5 I'd say I'm
like average height but I hang out with
quite a lot of tall people so I look a
lot smaller than I feel like I am how
much do you weigh ah I literally have no
idea I'm with myself in forever
any tattoos no any piercings just my
ears and I've had done loads I've had my
belly button done my tragus done I've
had my doubles done I've had underneath
and my tongue done and they've just all
my body just doesn't really like
piercings I think I only got my doubles
repierced though cuz I really like them
and my body didn't reject them
I just they were wearing some and kind
of robots they're closed up I think
wanna get them done again or like Mike
or something one true pairing I'm not
sure that means is that me and some one
or two people that I want to like be
together I'm really not sure I don't get
that question I don't know favorite show
and I really like the Real Housewives of
like Atlanta and Beverly hit Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills
what else do I like I really liked
Celebrity Big Brother when it was on TV
I basically like anything that's on I'm
TVB and I mean that sounds really like a
charge because it's all like Jeremy Carl
and stuff like that but when I do watch
TV That's not me the channel that has
the most interesting stuff one for me
favorite bands I really like is a band
more than one person I'm sure look if
you just mean like artists or whatever
I'll do my favorite artists so I really
like the weekend I like future I like
Drake I like I like Jeremiah I like rice
and tiller I like Rihanna I like all
that kind of stuff those kind of things
that I really like I'm really open to
listening to any type of music I think
I've said that in like a video before
I've been really open to listening to
all sorts but they're the kind of main
people that keep popping up on like my
playlists and stuff something you miss I
miss those things I kind of miss being
at school in the sense that I hung out
with like people like every day and
you're not like you know you're not like
forced hang out than but I know I would
see them all the time whereas now you
have to like because I'm quite busy and
stuff like make time and like I've never
really stressing me out so I don't see
the people that I want to see as much as
I would like to and like obviously
something those my friends went to uni
and stuff so I miss that I miss living
Australia - I used to live in Australia
for four years we didn't know no
favorite song I think at the moment if
my friends are watching this down though
because whenever it comes on whether
people that like really annoying and I
like
how old you I am 19 hours he comments
saying like how old is she how old is
she I am 19
zodiac sign I am a Libra I don't really
read into zodiac signs but I really kind
of want joining it's quite interesting
because some people are like oh when I
meet them and like I don't know what it
means that I read into it so tell me in
the comments like what that means that
make sense
quality you look for in a partner
movemove there's quite a few like top
ones I really like confidence I like
someone that can hold a conversation
that's not boring yeah I feel like fun
interesting you have to talk about
then I'll probably be interested in
talking to you
favorite quote and always always be
aware at the people that don't clap when
you win ain't that's relevant to us
favorite actor oh I've forgotten his
name but he played Mike in friends he's
in loads of stuff I really like him on a
tooth one either him or Leonardo
DiCaprio ski favorite color I like gray
and white and really pale nude pink
there are my favorite colors that
musical soft music loud I always always
always have my headphones in pretty much
that's why I like traveling all the time
it sounds like on the train and stuff I
can just put my headphones in and so now
I listen to my headphones when I just
sleep making that's really bad but I do
it anyway because sometimes I have like
a lot on my mind max you can't get my
mind sharp so I need to listen to music
to kind of like shut up
oh wait where do you go when you're sad
I'll go for like a drive or something
put my musical and I'll go to my room
I'll like hang out with my friends or
something yeah they're the kind of
things
to do inside all I just sit on my sofa
and do nothing like because I'm sad I'm
not really like I don't want to do
anything really so so far or go for a
drive and listen to music or like drive
to see my friends like drive somewhere
no how long does it take you to shower
okay depends if I'm washing my hair or
not if I'm just washing then literally
like 5-10 minutes if I'm washing my hair
I shampoo my hair with silver shampoo
and I need that once about five minutes
then I wash my hair with regular shampoo
then I want but then I do a mask in the
shower but you have to even for five
minutes and then I wash my hair with
conditioner and throughout that time I'm
washing with one of your shading and
stuff like that so I think I can shower
for like half an hour I feel like that's
quite a long time and I feel quite bad
but that is how I make a shower for I
just get distracted
how long's it to you to get ready in the
morning again depends where I'm going if
I'm like she doing nothing and like
maybe I just have to like drop something
on or whatever then I'll to let you take
like no minutes or five minutes because
I won't really wear any makeup if I'm
like filming or I'm going out then I can
take I'll give myself an hour and I'm
hopefully trying get it done in the hour
but if I'm like going out like girls
night out
getting drunk we're going out in town
out then I give myself like two hours to
get ready but that includes hair as well
so ever been in a physical fight
no but I've slapped a couple people for
very valid reasons don't judge me I say
people make it like two people in their
life like that's it okay turn on is that
like sexually like personality-wise I
didn't depending on who I'm talking to
I like being like really close it's
someone cuz you know and it's like that
heated moment you know I do I don't I
okay oh my god I'm laughing
I actually laughing stop
Wow turn off like bad breath like bad
nails and I'm really rude or like you're
really like laddie like that brick
that's a bit the turn-on for me just cuz
I mean is it
 off them fears I am terrified of
dying don't get me started talking about
dying because it really confuses me how
you're here and then suddenly you'll
just never you're not my god stop not
gonna talk about it last thing that made
you cry yesterday I went to the cinema
and I watched how to be single and my
eyes watered slightly at the end scene
with the dad and the daughter if you've
watched it you know I'm talking about
yeah that got me a bit emotional but I
don't cry often if I do it's mainly a
laughter I cry of laughter like all the
time at it like quite easily and I can't
remember the last time I cried of like
sadness last time you said you loved
someone I might have been yesterday to
my friend Lucy when we were saying like
I ever what's up just like nothing ever
to buy a meaning behind your tumblr URL
it's my name oh if you guys didn't know
I do have a tumblr i link it in my like
let me go back onto my channel page it's
like one of the links last book you read
I haven't read a book in so long
I mean that's why I chat so much random
crap because I haven't really learned
any new words recently so I really
should read I really like reading then
the next question the book you're
currently reading I'm not reading one I
really should the last show that you
watched and I think it was yesterday
before I got I went to bed and I was
watching obesity with my mom I think
that was it the last person you talked
to
let's see I have a whatsapp chat that
doesn't shut up if you're watching this
Wow Ellie you just sent a video just as
I was saying that but yeah
I have a whatsapp chat so I talked like
all of them that's from there the last
individual person that has text me I
know anything I should say okay moving
on the relationship between you and the
last person you texted there my friend
favorite food um I'm gonna have to go
ahead and say check-in like I cook
chicken all the time like I love roast
dinners I love like chicken in things I
have chicken and rice like a lot because
I live because I like to cook for myself
a lot and that's like one of the main
things I like one of the only things I
concur so if I ask you my favorite it's
probably that just because I I use I eat
so much of it so it must be my favorite
I mean place you want to visit I really
want to go to Bali or back to Australia
or visit more places in America I think
the last place you were huh the last
place I was I was just in London is that
is that what it means
well like the last foreign place I went
to was Colorado to see my sister do you
have a crush no I'd already crush on
people actually that's such a lie I
fancy like 800 people at once but
there's no time
no I find certain people attractive and
I'm thinking like oh but no I don't have
a crush on anyone last time you kissed
someone last time you're insulted pretty
sure I read a comment or like something
that right all the time
so I'm actually like lassen stopped me
to my face hasn't been in forever but I
read things all the time that's like too
much makeup thank you might wanna turn
it down something along those lines
favorite flavor of sweet peach I think I
really like peach flavored things like
strawberry I can't always go for like
the red one in every pocket what
instruments do you play
none but sorry
I don't play any instruments but I can
kind of play certain songs and like the
keyboard and piano and stuff that I've
like just happened to self-taught and I
can like I can't read music but I can
teach myself things in the piano I used
to play the flute don't like it anymore
complain the recorder kind of it does
not really count probably not favorite
piece of jewelry I have a Tiffany
necklace for my mom but I don't wore for
my parents but I don't wear it too often
because I don't really wear necklaces
but it's my favorite in the sense that I
got it for my 16th birthday and it was
like the most expensive thing in my life
at that time and also rare but I have
loads of like silver rings I freaking
love like diamonds and all that picked
diamonds and stuff like that
a sport you played I just played
football if you didn't know I just a
foot one net or I don't still really
enjoy both those things I don't play
them like another but yeah last song you
sang Wow
I sing all the time like I have random
outbursts of song if you know me like I
just kind of break down into song all
the time but I'm not really sure I'm
literally sing all the time it was
probably work that I just print the song
time probably sang a bit afterwards
favorite chat-up line Wow I don't really
use trap lines because I'm in me and I'm
probably burst out laughing or like when
I kill myself after I said it to shut a
favorite child line that I liked being
used on me I really like I just like
don't like chat bones in general like if
you want to come over and talk to me
because you want to like see what's
groaning over here then just like come
over and say like you're I like can I
get your drink or like something I can't
be dealing with the other bull crap have
I ever used it when I've gone up to
people in the night your eye and stuff
