today I'm gonna be a trying and sort of
testing and letting you guys know my
thoughts on some brand new at makeup
that's kind of just come in over the
past couple of weeks that's been hyped
about on social media that you guys
might be interested in to see kind of
how it looks how it wears what kind of
colors and all that kind of stuff so
basically you're just testing a bunch of
new makeup I feel like you guys
appreciate my thoughts on so you guys
know whether to get it or not side now I
just want to quickly say do you guys
like my jumpers you guys know my much
officially launched yesterday at 5 p.m.
the link is down below this hoodie is
one of them but the lips on it and
that's kind of what inspired this makeup
but today I already know in my head but
I want to have like a pink glam vibe
going on to go kind of with my jumper
but like I said or my match it's now
available and I have left the link down
below for you guys and the direct link
to my hoodie thank you so much for all
the love on it so far if you guys patch
anything please tag me on your socials I
would love love love to see you guys in
it but without further ado if you want
to see a bunch of new makeup being
tested we've got the Hooda foundation
natasha turn a sunset palette eyebrow
cushions yeah I know
then please a smash the like button down
below and make sure to hit subscribe if
you haven't already
come join the fam and let's get started
okay so the first product I'm gonna use
isn't like a new in kind of print but
it's like new for me and it is the Attar
rainforest of the sea maroon boosting
mist essentially this is just a really
hydrating mist to use to hydrate the
skin over see if you're lazy as
like me and you can't be asked to always
use moisturizer so I thought I'd give
this a go today
I never sure how much of this stuff
you're meant to spur whoo holy how that
smells really like zesty I want to say
oh my god it's all in my hair or my hair
I don't know if I like that smell you
know but that does feel really nice on
my skin my skin it feels so dry recently
and I don't know if you can tell them
yeah my skin feels super super dry at
the moment I feel like it's the weather
and just the change in climate is making
my skin go crazy
moving on I'm going to be using the huda
beauty
complexion perfection primer this is
obviously the primer that goes with the
foundation that they've come out with I
feel like when brands come out with
foundation and primers they're gonna be
what works best together they're kind of
formulated the same and yet they're
designed to work best probably so you
buy them together
well Oh what ha ha the partners jumping
ok well if the bottom option yeah and
again going in with my brush ok so I
think I have used this appointment
before but I think I've actually gonna
use it once I can't even remember what I
even thought about it it's quite a thick
primer but it blends really really
nicely into the skin always know if it's
gonna be a good primer because if it
leaves a little bit of a tack on your
finger that's when you know it's gonna
be a good primer because I think that
ingredients could like glycerin and
that's the stuff that's in that Nivea
post-shave barn that's obviously not a
primer but is like such a good primer I
think that's the same ingredient and it
just means that like anything you put on
the top it's really gonna cling and
stick to a face so literally not move
anywhere so that's the primer on so far
so far so good that feels like a good
primer it has a little bit of I like
makeup peace smelter and I can't put my
finger on what it smells like or if I
even like this mouth but yeah so far so
good that feels like it's gonna work
really well on my skin it's not too too
wet and but it's not too silicone II so
I feel like it's designed to work for my
skin types which is amazing but now it's
time to test for just that you guys know
my thoughts on the hooter BG foundation
and I've had this for like a little
while I've been wearing it a lot and I
do have to say I am in love with it like
I'm gonna apply it today with the brush
that it comes with or that you can buy
with it I have in the past or like all
the other times I've been using it been
using it with a sponge and I've been
loving it but I feel like I've seen
everyone kind of apply it to ha a face
to show the difference in the coverage
so I feel like I'm gonna do the same so
I can really start just shaking it so I
can really show you kind of what it
looks like because this is no joke guys
this is a full coverage foundation it
does not budge at all like I have dry
skin so maybe
when you're prepping your skin if you
have dry skin too got a bit more heavy
on your moisturizer maybe I missed like
this won't be enough but just use a
Brede maybe oil based moisturizer and
then go in with your primer that you
love and then with that foundation but
without further ado I'm going to mix
these two colors together this is the
color trailer trail lesha's tree trail
Isha's I don't know I said it in a
French accent last time I use this and
someone said it was Spanish so I don't
really know how to pronounce it but
basically tre leches is literally how
you would pronounce it if you didn't
have an accent and then the shade latte
so I'm gonna do one pump of latte and
one pump of tray letras on this side of
my face and again I'm gonna go in with
the brush and just show you how this
works maybe I'm gonna zoom you in as
well okay so this is the side of my face
with like nothing on and he's gonna go
in with the foundation
bear in mind guys I'm slightly more time
under hand I do like a slightly more
tanned foundation so I've see the color
difference is going to be one of the
biggest differences - can you see that
okay so I've never used this a brush
before but I can see why you get
complete maximum like coverage out of
this and like the most use of the
foundation when you use this because a
brush with these kind of bristles
doesn't absorb any of the product it
literally just lays it on your face and
the flattop of this really just presses
it into your skin and you guys know when
I say I want maximum coverage I always
go in with a flat top kabuki brush and
then go over with a sponge so they
weren't kidding when they said this was
a full coverage that was like two tiny
pumps and that has covered my whole face
well not my whole face but like my whole
half the face and the coverage is insane
but this has to be the most comfortable
full coverage foundation I've ever got
my hands on because a lot of foundations
with the similar coverage just feel so
sick on your skin and it's like
uncomfortable I feel caked like I really
don't like it whereas this feels fine on
my skin and looks insane and yeah so my
thoughts on the foundation are that I
really really love it as
full-coverage going out foundation
definitely not everyday but yeah I know
that I'm now gonna go ahead and do my
other side of the face and we'll be back
okay so I also went ahead and did my
concealer because I didn't have a new in
concealer but for all you full coverage
whores out there tah shape tape Plus
that Hoonah foundation oh my god I can't
tell you how like I brushed I feel
honestly I like this is full coverage
realness I'm like obsessed and it's been
my go-to combination for when I've been
from when I've been going out because it
literally it doesn't budge but I am just
gonna quickly set everything in place
with powder I actually feel like I don't
need to because like I said I've got dry
skin and both of those products are like
of a matte finish but I just always like
to set it in place anyway because I may
have dry skin but I'm a sweaty bitch you
know I sweat a girl sir and sometimes
when I'm out on about just like around
my forehead and like my top lip and
stuff can get a little bit sweaty so I
just like to make sure everything is a
hundred percent set in please now this
is a new and fun product this is from
iconic London and they're calling it
their eye brow cushion so it comes in a
really cute snazzy case like this and if
I open it up it literally is an eyebrow
cushion I think it comes in light medium
and dark and this is the medium shade so
a slightly lighter color and a dark
color I feel like the lighter color is
to go through the front of your brows
and obviously the darker color through
the tail to create that ombre effect now
I feel like I'm gonna use the little
tool that it comes with to get the full
fast impression and trying the new
makeup think so I'm gonna zoom you in
and see how this goes okay so I'm gonna
go ahead and take the brush and just
press it in to the darker color I feel
like you just kind of DAB it in like
that I'm gonna take this on okay wait
first one gonna brush through the brow
now so this is the shade medium and I'm
taking the slightly darker color okay
I'm not really sure like what I'd call
this it's not a poem aid it's not it is
almost like a liquid OH
this will be the pigmentation test cuz
you guys know the tail of my brows are
like non-existent I'm kind of liking how
easy it is to apply and to be able to
like sculpt do your brows with it it
does actually say something about it
being like an eyebrow sculpt cushion
type product because it literally just
glides onto your skin because it's about
the liquidy consistency and I quite like
the colors but it's a very cool medium
brown I'm gonna stop there with the
darker color and move on to the lighter
color if I'm just gonna dab my brush
into the lighter color and start doing
the front of my brow you guys know I
like to turn my brush up and like mimic
brow has this brush is really good for
doing that actually I think that looks
really natural what do you guys think
that was pretty easy like that's
probably the quickest I've done an
eyebrow in like months I'm assuming it
kind of just like dries down but I like
it I'm enjoying that pigmentation too so
that's the iconic London eyebrow cushion
but I'm gonna go ahead and do the other
brow and then we'll get back to doing
the face okay so that's both the
eyebrows done I do feel like the color
is slightly too dark but then the light
one was too light and then doc was
obviously gonna be definitely too dark
but they do dry completely matte and I
thought it was super easy and quick to
do so on that note I actually quite like
it's a funky new eyebrow product guys an
eyebrow cushion so now let's continue on
with the face so to contour I'm gonna be
using these new kind of face colours
from makeup forever and they gave me a
personalized little box that they came
in which is so cute so I assume that you
can purchase the kind of palette online
and you can pick three inserts to go in
I have left the names of these down
below and they gave me a contour a blush
and a highlighter so I'm just gonna
start off with the one SWAT color so off
the bat it picks up quite a lot of
products are now I'm gonna tap a lot of
it off I feel like it's gonna be quite
pigmented but this contour color in
particular is of the warmer kind of
blush here vibe it reminds me of like
Mac
harmony which is a really gorgeous blush
a birth when I used to work at Mac it
was always used as a contour color it
just had a bit more warmth to it so it
tended to be a bit more flattering on
most people so I'm really enlightening
this and they blend really nicely as
well but they're actually not as
pigmented as I thought but that might be
because I'm tapping the product off
there just seemed really like buildable
which i think is a crucial factor of a
makeup product cuz then you can
customize it to how you like it I like
that color it's really like I said it's
more of the warm contour color so if you
actually prefer more of the cooler
contour colors maybe I'm gonna call
mynah see that other shades that they
have on offer but this one it gave me
but that blended really nicely into this
skin
I love set now to bronze I feel like
this isn't a new product but it's new
for me this is from a BH Cosmetics and
it is their satin bronzer in the color
tranquil tan you guys know I love a sort
of shimmery based bronzer so I will see
go for more like the matte contour and
then a bit of a shimmery bronzer on the
whoa this skin okay that was a lot of
product it just came off there but that
color oh my god I love it that's not too
warm so I'm like not looking orange
everybody is tan and that blends really
nicely into the skin as well I didn't
feel like just then when I deposited
like a lot onto my face that like
blended super easy I wasn't having to
bath around and work around her I love
that BH Cosmetics is such a super
affordable brand so I love when you find
like a new product that you're gonna be
obsessing over and it's super affordable
I think they're also available on
beautybay so for US UK babies okay so
I'm gonna leave that for the bronze up
but I love so now I'm gonna dip into
that blusher from the makeup forever
the little palette definitely more of
the peachy a bronzer which I can really
appreciate as you guys know ah pretty -
I will say though I wish there was like
a bit of like shimmer in it or something
I think blushes looks so much like more
flattering and like youthful when they
have just add a little bit of shimmer
running through whether it's just like a
bit of a gold or something I do
like that color you guys know I
definitely prefer more of a peachy a
blusher when it comes to blush so I
really like that color I would have left
the name of it down below makeup ever
names are so weird they're like numbers
but it'll be the one that starts with a
B now this I think will be a product you
guys and appreciate I'm gonna do my
highlighter I am gonna use the one from
here but I'm gonna puts down almost like
a base highlighter first now this is
actually a eyeshadow and it's from Kiko
if you guys follow me on snapchat if you
don't it's right here but this is the
water eyeshadow in two three three now
you know I thought when I saw this this
reminds me of the fenty Beauty trophy
wife highlighter but it's an eye shadow
from Kiko so if you loved the look of
that fenty Beauty a highlight of it was
completely out of your price range or
just you've been able to get your hands
on it I feel like this is a dupe you
know and it's an eye shadow and it's not
it's also not as intense as that as the
trophy wife if I just apply that here
and show you it's a lot more of like a
subtle gold highlight and for me this is
I like I loved the color of the trophy
wife highlighter but it was almost too
intense so therefore the gold was too
yellow on my skin tone in it wouldn't it
didn't look as good as it did on someone
with a slightly darker complexion I feel
like this is the this is like a product
that allows me to get that same
undertone which is why I loved that one
it's such a unique gold but it's not as
intense it just gives a bit more of like
a golden glow rather than a golden pop I
literally love the undertone of that so
like I said that was the Kiko water
eyeshadow in two to three and now I can
dip in to the makeup forever highlighter
i swatched this on my snapchat and it
was pigmented let me tell ya that but
like I said I've left the name of this
one down below it will be the one that
starts with the letter H and I'm just
gonna apply this on the top
both of these apply really like a
buttery on to the skin so I always find
you get the most out of them when you
use circular motions but I'm just gonna
have it that down the bridge of my nose
and on to my Cupid's bow as well see so
that is the scared and finished and I'm
literally loving everything that's on my
face right now I feel like this would
last a long time too which is always a
bonus so I'm now going to go ahead and
move on to the eye makeup which I'm so
excited about the cause we're using this
bad boy
the warmer palette of dreams the sunset
palette by Natasha oh no no let's go
okay so not hundred percent sure what
exactly I'm going to be doing but I'm
gonna be using some more of the pinky
earth tones so I'm gonna be taking this
pale pink color here and that's gonna be
our initial transition color I'm also
actually going to be mixing it slightly
with this orange here but mainly
focusing on the pain I'm just gonna be a
buffing that backwards and forwards if
you guys have never heard of Natasha -
no no she is I think like a European
makeup artist I definitely know she's
not from the UK but she's from the
Europe side of things I think and she
kind of became big on Instagram because
of her like incredibly good loi flawless
makeup and I think from that she then
decided to come out with her own makeup
so obviously as you can guess when a
makeup artist like professional makeup
artist comes out with their own makeup
range they know exactly what they want
and what people want what works best all
that kind of stuff so her makeup it has
always been phenomenal and she comes out
with the coolest stuff like this I
shadow palette is in sane the
pigmentation is beautiful the only
problem is but they're so worth it I
feel like they're so pretty the color
payoff is stunning like these mats are
just what China moving a forward I'm
gonna take this shade right here from
the same palette it looks really brown
on camera but it does have a slightly
warm me rosy undertone to it so perfect
for a slightly pink a base look I'm just
gonna use that to further deepen up the
crease I think I'm gonna go for like a
half cut crease kind of
look today because I did my face first
oops but they're like an easy glam look
to do and I feel like a style that
anyone can achieve so I'm just gonna be
applying that color to further deepen up
the crease then just going back in with
a big fluffy brush to diffuse the colors
together okay and the final crease color
we're gonna be using is this gorgeous
pink down here this color literally it
screamed to me when I opened this
palette it looked so pretty and I'm just
using that on a smaller fluffy brush I
can get really precise with my placement
and I do want this color to be quite
visible in the eye so I don't want to
blend it like away too much I don't let
to be any kind of like super harsh lines
going on yeah okay so they're kind of
all the matte crease cutters that I plan
to use kind of done for now I'm just
gonna use my concealer to create a half
cut crease and then we can move on to
the lid color which I'm still not sure I
want to do but I think there's there
like a shimmering golden hair calling
money okay so now we have done that we
can go ahead and do it the lid color I
think I'm gonna go in with this shimmery
gold just because I feel like that's
gonna tie it in with everything that's
going on so I'm just gonna go ahead and
press on with a brush oh
these shimmery colors are like pressed
pigments almost there so pigmented of C
having that concealer down acts as like
a really good base yes to the gold
shimmer I did know a little bit of fall
out there if you look at the palette
there's kind of a little bit of fallout
from it so the product itself is a
little bit flaky I'm just going back in
with my brush to diffuse the two colors
together but now I'm looking at that I
do think I want to apply one more trade
so I'm gonna I'm gonna go in with this
matte Brown here from the palette again
this has a slightly more Pinker
undertone than some of the other ones so
still sticking with that pinky theme you
can apply that to further deepen the
crease okay now I'm gonna take the matte
white shade from the palette and just
highlight my inner corner I was so glad
that this palette came with
a like highlighting color for your brow
bone or your inner corner because
sometimes palettes just come with like
really really like golds and they don't
they're not like bright enough for my
personal taste in terms of like
highlighting the inner corner so loving
that I'm just gonna take a pencil brush
and take that kind of matte orange e
rosy color from the palette that we used
earlier and just run that underneath my
eyes to kind of connect everything
together and finish off the eye okay now
onto a mascara and lashes now this is a
new mascara for me is the Tarte lights
camera lashes mascara and so far when
I've been using this I actually have
really been loving it I didn't think I
would because the brush isn't nice to
brush for a really good mascara but I'm
not applying a huge coat as I will be
applying the falsies but they really
just kind of fan out my lashes and give
a really nice fluttery effect so I
really have been loving this so if you
guys are the market for a new mascara
try the top lights camera lashes because
I am really loving this now here's what
I'm really excited about these are new
lashes from the LA and they are in the
style dream girl they look so fluffy and
so fluttery so I'm gonna go ahead and
apply these now and show you what the
star looks like I feel like I am gonna
be in love of these okay so these are
the finished eyes with the eyelashes on
I knew I was gonna be in love of this
style they're like a brilliant gorgeous
fluttery rounded style so whenever I do
my rounded eyes I feel like these are
gonna be my go-to lasts from now on I've
left the name of them down below
obsessed they look super natural too
okay moving on to the lips eyes you can
already tell I've already lined my lips
cuz I didn't have a new lip liner but to
go with my baby a pink hoodie I'm gonna
be using this newer liquid lipstick from
a bleach London this is Lou t---cells
makeup brand or just like brand in
general and she kindly gifted me a bunch
of products that she thought I would
love and she gave me they're like most
gorgeous nude this is called a Matt
LeBlanc I am or i swatch the color i'm
already
test and it's definitely gonna go with
the like baby pink vibe that we've got
going on so I do deliberately want this
to be quite a baby like pink so I'm
gonna go ahead and apply this now this
is so pigmented and feels so comfortable
like sometimes with a lot of liquid
lipsticks you have to really build on
the color and the pigmentation but this
has like instant coverage straightaway
and it's really gorgeous color to it
always like dries instantly but in a
good way but I'm obsessed with that
color it's so Purdy appropriate the
author I'm going to be going in with a
gloss and this is from a pear cosmetics
it is part of their like nude or their
nude gift set that they come out with
and this is the above day suit gloss now
what I love about this it comes with
like a light so you can use it in the
dark and it has like a little mirror on
the side too so I'm just gonna be
applying this on the top oh my god it
smells like like cakes like vanilla
smell I love that you see how the gloss
kind of neutralized that pink a little
bit and made it a bit more peachy and
wearable mmm I'm I really like that
combination together ah that is the
finished makeup look so this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
