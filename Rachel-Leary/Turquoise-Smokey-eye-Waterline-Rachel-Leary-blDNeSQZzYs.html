like a wasted
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
I'm just starting off priming my face
using my Oprah ultimate face primer and
then going ahead and do my brows ease on
my brow fine and browser moving on to
the eye makeup i'm using the lorac i
shadow primer and then this shades of
makeup geek called a purely naked which
is kind of like a really soft brown man
just buffing that into the crease using
my Sigma e-40 I will leave links to the
eye brushes that i use it down below as
well as all the products mentioned
we're only going to be using to crease
shades and I'm taking this one from the
stick of a smokescreen palette i'm
taking my sigma e25 brush to brush to
brush to blend this in to my crease just
to further different and add more
dimension to the eye then I'm going back
in the original around my god I
literally cannot talk the original
fluffy brush that we were using the
Sigma e-40 just to stopping out the two
colors together and make sure there is
no harsh lines at the lid shade i'm
using this makeup geek foiled shadow in
the shade of Pegasus I'm absolutely in
love with it it's such a gorgeous color
I never really use turquoise because
blue and blue don't really complement
each other as in my eye color and shadow
color but I really wanted to use this
one cuz i do not used it yet and you
guys been asking for more color so i
thought i would start off with this one
and then i'm going back in with the
sigma e25 just to soften the crease
color in to the lid shade and then i'm
going in with my makeup wipes just to
clean up the edges and make sure we get
that nice wing so it makes our eyeliner
so much easier to do you can use tape to
this or you can use your concealer or
something like that this is just the
method I prefer to use for eyeliner i'm
using my inglot jawline it in number 77
and this amazing eyeliner brush from
sigma i will leave it down below it's
literally my favorite for eyeliner then
it going head and applying lashes these
are the red cherry five to eight threes
so just really whiskey and have a little
wing moving on to face i'm using the
Bourjois healthy mix foundation and it's
a bit beige for me so i'm adding this
skin based mixer from Illamasqua which
is new and it's in the shade amber just
to add that yellow tin then i'm using my
NARS creamy concealer in the shade
custard and just applying that to all
the places that I want to highlight so
you guys know the drill down the center
of my nose chin above the brow and then
I am blending it in with my Real
Techniques sponge obviously it's damp up
otherwise you literally like it doesn't
do anything making sure the sponge is
damp absorbs any excess product and it
blends everything really nicely into the
skin and make sure that you're using
like minimal product on the skin and
avoids that kind of k kilo then i'm
using this liquid highlighter from sigma
on the tops of my cheekbones and then
just blending that in with my finger
just because i think that's the best way
to blend
these kind of products in as your
fingers have kind of warmth to them and
it blends it in it to the other creams
that you've already applied it to your
skin and in love with this I recently
got it and it gives such a nice glow to
the skin then using my laura mercier
translucent powder i'm not baking
anything i'm using this really small
kind of precise tapered face brush from
sigma to press it under my eyes making
sure not to obviously mattify the
highlighter we just put down but just
using it in all the places that we
highlighted with the concealer to get
rid of any shine and make sure it lasts
all day then i'm using mac give me some
bronzer underneath the highlight that we
just placed in my cheekbones bringing up
onto my forehead and just essentially
placing it in all the places that i want
to warm up my skin
for blush I'm using the mac mineralized
blusher in warm soul this is literally
the blush I'd recommend to anyone that's
a bit scared to try blusher because it's
such a subtle color then I'm
highlighting at my cheats again with a
powder highlighter using Laura Geller
gilded honey is essentially just to kind
of emphasize the liquid highlights that
we put on as you can see it's amazing
the conversation the conversation the
combination together is like my new
favorite moving back onto the eyes I am
taking this waterproof cream color in
the shade ice blue with a really kind of
small flat shader brush and just placing
this in my Ward's line to add a pop of
color to match the eyelid you could use
a pencil bliss I was looking through my
collection and I literally couldn't find
a pencil in this color this was the kind
of only thing I could put in my
waterline that was closest to the lid
shade and as you can see it's just like
a really interesting pop of color so you
could use any sort of color for this to
kind of match the lid shade I just said
to get the turquoise then taking the
original purely naked color that we had
in the crease and just place mat
underneath the water line to soften it
out and add a bit of depth to the lower
lash line then applying bottom lash
mascara and that is the eyes completed
moving on to lips I'm taking this pencil
from NYX in the color nude beige I'm
going with a nude lip just because I
didn't want to draw any attention away
from the eyes I know you guys always
think I do a nude lip but they are my
favorite as you guys know then recently
I picked up a couple of liquid lipsticks
with dose of colors and I wanted to try
them out and I am in love this one is in
the shade truffle more of a cooler tone
color but still bit of a nude but it was
a bit too pink for me so I decided to go
in with the Anastasia Beverly Hills
gloss in undressed just to add a bit
more of a toned down nude look so it
wasn't so pink and that is the finished
look I'm obsessed with both of these I
hope you guys enjoyed make sure to give
it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe
if you haven't already and I will see
you in the next tutorial bye guys
and mac lipstick in velvet teddy which
i'm pretty sure because of her anyway
and i think one of her makeup artist
said ages ago that she wore velvet teddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
