am wearing a Christmas jumper it's the
first Christmas jump I've put on haven't
actually wanted Christmas jumper yet and
now I put it on a dome to take it off my
gonna wear everyday as you can tell by
today's title today's video is a
Christmas gift guide for those that love
makeup and beauty there's a couple of
things in here that aren't really makeup
this like a nail set and like body stuff
but basically it's like a makeup gift
guide and there's so much stuff to
include so many brands have come up with
amazing gift sets this year so many
brands have come out with amazing gift
sets this year that I've kinda been sent
and some I purchased myself so I just
wanted to kind of give you an idea and
show you I know what I would get someone
that really loves makeup or just like
give you guys inspiration for those of
you that love makeup maybe you want to
add these to your Christmas list or
you're just struggling to find like
gifts for those that love makeup I've
listed everything it done below when I
did the links everything was in stock
but I know that like Christmas coming
things got our stocks so so so quickly
so I've listed all the names down below
so I'm sure you'll be able to find the
products elsewhere if the links that
I've given you they're out of stock on
also if you like this makeup look it'll
be up next week and it's all drugstore
as well so you can get excited for that
one but yes let's go ahead and get
started you see me keep like looking
over that because I've written
everything down and they've written the
prices down as well so I just kind of am
looking for reference but I think around
this time of year a really good gift for
someone that's really into makeup is a
brush set now I have it three here and
all are slightly on the x-naught it's
mixed for a decent brush set I think you
do need to invest in a bit besides
morphe a do like cheap brush sets but a
high quality but if you realistically
want a decent brush that you are gonna
have to like invest in a bit of money
just because they give you a lot for
your money you get like a loads of
brushes in there so that's kind of why
they're expensive and some include like
bags and stuff which might up the price
but yes I will show you the ones I have
fit so one for me that's kind of like
really aesthetically pleasing is this
one from spectrum brushes it comes with
this bag which opens up like this oh to
be able to fit all the brushes in and
there
that's for maybe just like myself
Siddhant I'm holding upside down so that
can just fit like maybe your sponge in
or something but this brush that is a 12
piece brush and I'm pretty sure there is
definitely more than 12 holes there so
you can fit even more brushes in there
and it's that rose gold detailing and
black marble and then this is what
inside is what's in that side it is
their black and rose gold brushes I'm
pretty sure they have white ones of
these as well and I just think these are
so aesthetically pleasing for someone
that loves and makeup and wants to try
to brush it this one is actually only 17
pounds or 69 at 99 to be precise which
really really isn't bad at all for a
brush set especially at such high
quality these all vegan as well there or
like cruelty-free and I was lucky enough
to go to the launch of this of the
spectrum brushes and the girls behind it
are so lovely as well so yeah I thought
this would be a really cool Christmas
present including the bag I think if
you're into makeup or want to try new
brushes or you know someone that's
wanting to like get better at makeup I
think a brush set and especially this
one is a good idea hey another brush set
company which I know is everyone's
favorite is zoeva
recently they've just launched on a cult
Beauty which is where I got mine from so
super easy to get hold of and this is
their luxe complete set 15 black bear it
comes with their classic clutch bag put
your brushes in or I kind of use these
as like makeup bag and then it contains
six clean brushes face and I their
brushes are amazing obsessed so you've
got like a few of the face brushes kind
of like all the necessity ones that you
need you've got the luck space to finer
you've got Wonder Foundation highlight
any blush or powder and then like as
much concealer ones and they're really
amazing at blending brushes as well
notice I'm not like opening these up
because I might get these as gifts or
something so I don't want to guys like
you're in the packaging so I've linked
it down below so you can get like a full
on a picture but again these are just as
amazing at the spectrum ones if this one
is obviously slightly more expensive
because there's more brushes in it this
one I think is 105 pounds and I linked
it down below but and if it's out of
stock there so you can just google it
and find it elsewhere but yeah I think
so ever brushes they have so many maybe
not exactly this one I know they just do
I sets or they do like different colored
like handled ones and I think they're so
pretty and aesthetically pleasing as
well so that one is from is over inside
it's like pink to which I thought it's
pretty Oh on the back it actually says
all the ones that are in it so you've
got the luxe face to find out the silk
finish luxe highlight luxe cheek finish
concealer buffer luxe soft crease luxe
defined Cruz luxe soft definer luxe
crease looks pencil luxe petit crease
luxe smokey shader fine liner winged
liner and brow line so basically it has
you completely covered and finally this
is the total pro at 21 at peace deluxe
brush set from a blank of canvas
cosmetics and it does have come with
kind of like a fold out professional
case this might be more for someone that
slightly more advanced because it is
slightly more expensive so it'd be more
of an investment present this is 134
pounds and at 22 pence to be precise it
comes in a really sleek black whatever
case like this and it's almost just like
a brush a book already in place for you
blank cameras cosmetics brushes were
actually at one besides Sigma well one
of the first brushes like fresh that's
like ever used I actually asked for a
blank canvas cosmetics brush set for I
think it was my birthday like a few
years ago and they've lasted me it's so
long they're such good quality like
they're like a lot of people don't
actually talk about them but they have
so many other brush sets this is just
the 21 at piece one so I know they have
smaller ones again like Zoe birth
they've got ones specifically for eyes
you know someone that really wants to
kind of work on that I makeup or
something so yeah 421 brushes 134 pounds
isn't actually that much if you thought
about it individually say like each
brush was like a tenner you're saving a
lot instead of it being like 210 pounds
it's only hundred and thirty-four so
again it is slightly more expensive when
you think like oh my god 134 pounds but
you are getting a lot for your money and
like I said these are just ideas and
this is just more of an advanced
processor than the others
okay I'm moving on to a makeup set one
of the Browns that has probably come out
with the most maybe and especially on an
affordable price as well is NYX so I
thought I would show you something I
top picks from the kind of Knicks
holiday collection and everything that
they've brought out they brought out
these super I think these are so cute
there are little pallets and they are
called a lip it's pop their lip and eye
collection and they're named after loads
of cities again like their lip creams
and that's because it contains eight
eyes shadows and a lip cream so perfect
for maybe those just I'm - it's just
starting out with makeup because they do
it's so many different color like
palettes to suit everyone these are just
two of my top picks
this one is Copenhagen so this one
contains kind of more a movie show
frobisher's movia tones but it's a mix
of shimmer and mattes and is the
copenhagen soft matte lip cream which is
a dark plum color so I thought this
would be perfect for this time of year
and it's quite like a safe palette I
think lots of people love these kind of
colors and it comes with a big mirror as
well so and they're so handy for trouble
so I think these are so cute and like a
really cute gift maybe for Secret Santa
or stocking or something like that so
yeah that one is in Copenhagen and the
other one I really like is London can
you tell why so this one again has those
warmer tones slightly more kind of jewel
tones I think with the shimmers and
you've got like a bright red in there
and it's the London lip cream which is
one of their most popular nude shade but
like I said they have so many other
colors and stuff I've left the link to
them down below on the Bhoots website so
you can see the full range there's
bright colored ones and stuff like that
but yeah I think these are a good gift
idea for maybe someone of a younger age
or yeah like I said stocking filler or
something and these retail for for
seniors moving on it this is the NYX
tricks of the trade travel kit and is 25
pounds so it's slightly more expensive
but you get so much in here you get the
pore filler you get the liquid
illuminator a butter gloss in it creme
brulee which is one of my favorites you
get the HD definition like powder you
get the blush and a contour duo and you
also get the all-over barn which I've
actually not used but I'm pretty sure
it's just kind of like a lip balm and
then a little mini of their matte finish
spray so I think this is perfect for
maybe like I said someone that's just
wanting to start trying out
make up or for maybe someone that
travels a lot because everything's kind
of like mini oh yeah someone that's just
wanting to start trying out with makeup
cuz there's some good bits in here to
play with some of that cult-like
favorites by most and it has and it's
this super convenient kind of you know
watch bag as well so I thought that was
a good idea again maybe for Secret Santa
or something like I said this values at
25 pounds moving on to it these boob
barbers this is the NYX liquid suede lip
Bowl basically contains all of their
liquid lips Wade's in a mini aversion
and it's actually only 65 pounds so
again might sound like a lot but when
you're thinking about how much you're
getting it's quite a lot so really a
good value for money these I think was
super super popular and when I link to
them down below it did say last few
remaining so I'm not sure if they're
still gonna be in stock or not but if
you google them I'm sure you can find
them elsewhere from the links that I've
done so I think this would be ideal for
someone that might be like a NYX junkie
or like has always wanted to try NYX
products or maybe just someone that's
obsessed with like the many things I
think this would be a really a good idea
and again this is the NYX soft matte lip
cream vault so you get a lot more in
here I think competitor liquid lip
Suede's but this one is again also
65-pound
contains all of the soft matte lip
creams Cairo is my fave and I'm pretty
sure there's anyone in there
so I'm obsessed with this and again this
would be perfect for someone that's
maybe obsessive their lip products loves
being creative because it's got like the
purples and bright colors in here as
well or again just like loves midi
products I think this is like quite like
a show-stopping gift and it's not
exactly breaking the bank when you
really think about it another company
that has come up with some amazing
makeup gift sets this year as well is
sleep this I think is possibly the
acutest present ever
this is the minimap me collection and it
contains some of my favorite liquid
lipsticks in here we've got the is it
Rioja
Rioja red which is my ultimate fave
you've got velvet slipper birthday suit
of course which is that famous nude one
and old-hollywood which is a dark plum
you can't really actually think it's
birthday suit and old Hollywood that you
can see but in here we've got the felts
and then Rio red would be like here the
velvet slipper is kind of like that
movie dark purple inu be kind of color
so I think kind of a color for everyone
in there you've got the light nude
medium nude a dark purple and red and
this is only a fiver so this is the
perfect present for someone maybe that
loves liquid lipsticks or like a secret
santa present or something like that is
the acutest packaging ever also really
good at stocking filler as well
this is that secretly it's spell
abounded glitz and glam makeup set this
contains by should open it up for you
and show you inside the box it looks
like this so again another kind of
show-stopping a gift the lip color that
comes with this is a bright red so this
might be more aimed at someone that
likes that kind of classic gap Lola
classic glamour look if I kind of turn
this around and show you what's inside
because I don't really want to open it
you can see everything is of a really a
wearable warmer tone this is their eye
defined palette in all night long their
face form in medium which you've seen me
use in tutorials loads of times it has a
matte bronzer a tremor and a shimmery
bronzer and the all night long palette
as you can see is of a warm tone as well
comes with a brush which is that contour
brush a brow stylist in medium a red lip
liner in sugared apple there Dippet
liquid eyeliner and there lip VIP in
nightspot as I said this is girly more
maybe for someone that that already
loves makeup has that classic glam look
or is something that they want to try
out because this contains everything you
would need it to do so and this only
retails for 28 pounds when you really
think about it you're getting so much
for your money but this kind of contains
everything that they would need to try
and it's a really high quality as well
okay finally moving on from makeup to
kind of more skincare and makeup type
sets and one brand that has absolutely
outdone themselves and always does is so
cool glory so I have got a diverse range
of gift sets give sets to show you from
them they have so many on there on the
Bhoots website so definitely head to
beas to check them all out but I will
show you my topics so style would be a
small
one this is their coal ID little Sat and
it's like a kaleidoscope you can look
through it and turn it and it's got like
a feeds down here I just think
everything soap and glory does is always
so thought through and so cute as well
everything that you buys there's more to
it than just what's inside does that
make sense they go so extra they're
packaging and that's why I think they're
perfect for this time of year so in side
this I actually like I'm not sure you
open it to show you but it's basically
at three eye pencils in the shade
smolder foil in love and what a night
and it is basically a black white and a
navy blue coal pencil this is perfect
there's someone have you know that they
love eyeliner or maybe they want to
experiment with eyeliner I think this is
a really a nifty gift possibly for a
stocking filler and also a secret Center
and this one retails for ten pounds like
I said I can't really like open them
because I maybe won't want to give them
away or give them as gifts but like I
said I've left links them all down below
so you can find in there and you'll have
better pictures and stuff okay this is
their girl a whirl set and this is 12
pounds and it basically you you can
twist it like this and like they've got
things here if you can kind of change
their outfits and stuff just do I mean
like there's always more to what's
inside but speaking about what's inside
this contains a little bush sponge and
then it contains some of their best
selling products in here I can get these
out hold on we have a mini of the
breakfast smoothie scrub so it's got
like oh it's a sheer butter and sugar
bodies like smoother and it's this is a
pretty good exfoliator then we have a
mini of their like smoothie butter body
cream smells like a creme brulee it is
amazing if so this is perfect for this
could be a perfect kind of like pump of
Christmas present if you know someone
that needs to kind of pump themselves
these are really cute as well yeah
infamous hand food hand cream and a mini
of their body wash yeah I just I just
thought this was such a cute gift and
it's only at 12 pounds really is kind of
looks a lot more to it than it is so
again a bit more of an exciting present
and not breaking the bank at all with
this okay this is their foam or fortune
which is 16 pounds and this one actually
it makes a noise hold on but yeah so
this contains a lot of the same sort of
stuff it's just in a kind of like metal
tin and it seems as well if I try and
take this off without ruining it there
we go and this one it contains another
loose like scrubby thing the scrub of
your life a body scrub you clean on me a
moisture shower gel their infamous
righteous body butter again a another
scrub this one's in the Schleich flavor
sugar crash rating and a sugar crush a
body cream and finally a sugar wash body
wash so again just a target more
expensive this time this when I said
with 16 pounds but you do get a few more
products in there this is the pink
pamper set so it's in this really cool
geometrical geometrical triangular zip
up case so if I open it up again hey
another loofah is in here oh my god
everything's all wrapped up okay so I
won't unwrap everything but it contains
another Luther and this time it has all
of these in it so we've got the
righteous Body Butter the hand food
again a heal genius so more of a gift
foot cream their three-in-one daily
detox of bitumen facial wash in
miniature the clean on me
moisture shower gel and the scrub of
your life so in here we have one two
three four five six and with the sponge
as well and this really cool kind of
makeup bag and this one is 15 pounds so
there's two pounds are more expensive
than the other one and this one contains
more like feet products and stuff so
yeah that's that one and finally one I
think a lot of people have seen in at
people's snapchats
is the whole glam locked set so this
comes in a little suitcase at in case so
perfect maybe actually someone like a
younger age they might appreciate this I
think it's really cute but this one is
30 pounds see what like a little tag on
it as if it was you are going on a
holiday and this one is actually a
limited edition and everything
here or together is worth 60 pounds so
like I said this is amazing value for
money so it opens up like so and you get
so much in this one and everything in
here is like a full-size product we've
got the righteous body butter scrub
hanjo another scrub what's this like a
moisturizer for your face although this
one's a little mini one this is their
sexy mother pucker gloss in rose and
shine it so it's super cute and mascara
in here it's so yes this basically
contains so much of staff and it is only
at 30 pounds and I did say it is limited
edition so a hundred percent get this
while you can before like it sells out
and I think this would be it the perfect
gift under the tree bit of a showstopper
as well in this case and maybe someone
of a younger age or actually of an old
age maybe would love this and finally
the last thing maybe not as exciting as
those and it's not really of the
skincare it is a nail set and this is
from Deborah Lippmann she does a amazing
nail varnish I thought this was the
cutest set either is maybe like a
stocking filler or a Secret Santa is the
ice princess set and it comes with this
pink shade which actually has a compare
that's an iridescent finish to it and I
think it's could levy on the hose or
something and on its own is Buchan have
it the heart of glass topper on top
which is like a glittery lip like a tit
lip nail lacquer that you put on top of
it or you could just wear either damn
like I said on their own but I thought
this was super cute and this is only at
17 pounds might be for what it is you
might think that's a bit expensive but
Deborah Lippmann is more of a high-end
nail varnish brand so I thought again
this would be like a luxury nail treat
for maybe it's someone that loves a good
at nude or a sparkly nail this time of
year so that is the end of this gift
guide I think I kind of tackled every
ends of the spectrum in terms of prices
maybe and ideas again this is just a
gift guide not telling you to buy all
these stuff or anything like that or if
you don't get this stuff someone that
likes makeup
they've been in like not like it these
are just ideas this is just suggestions
that maybe I would get someone that
make up and you can take as much
inspiration or as Missal as inspiration
from this as you want like I said
