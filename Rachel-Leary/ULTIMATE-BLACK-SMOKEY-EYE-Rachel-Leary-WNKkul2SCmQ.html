it's pressing first between what
happened Valentine's Day so happy
Valentine's Day second thing this is my
first video with kind of Muller lights
and new at camera so for all of you guys
saying about the smoothing filled cells
on my previous camera I did it dragged
it on Twitter and I said it wasn't my
fault
I like the sacking was turned off on my
camera so this one doesn't have line
there so there's nothing to turn off so
you're going to see everything in my
full glory yeah today I'm doing cause I
can ultimate black smokey eye we only
need one palette which i think is really
good and you can either switch up with
cool tones or warm tones for me
personally I've used warm tones to kind
of buff everything else that complements
my I had a lot more obviously it mixed
us you can have shimmers and stuff this
is a completely or matte eye look I'm
trying to make it as easy as possible
but kind of as dramatic as possible so
it's kind of like ultimate easy and
tense for that good stuff so I really do
guys in joy at this tutorial I'm really
taking the straight hair I think maybe
for the next year I'm going to do like a
spring vibe scans that's going to be
colorful and I'm going to do a hair in
it as well for the slick straight as I'm
really loving it at the moment
if you like you enjoyed that let me know
in the comments down below so obviously
if you like the look of good makeup
tutorials and that please keep watching
and don't forget to give it a thumbs up
if you do
okay I'm going to start off with the
iPhone I feel like black is a color that
is so so difficult to kind of get off
the skin so I'm going to use a little
bit of tape to do this I've seen a few
comments recently saying that people
don't like using tape just like from
previous videos I've done because it
really hurts and they put it like on
their skip or when they take off their
skin so no tip if you just put it on the
back of your hand first and just stick
it down and then you know peel it off
that kind of gets rid of some of its
initial sticky notes it's still going to
stick to your skin but it's just going
to hurt a little less when you take it
off so I'm just going to get as well
there's the kind of heading towards the
end of my brow then I'm just going to go
ahead and prime it and I'm just going to
use my concealer to do that that is the
Maybelline fit me concealer I'm just
going to jab that all over my lid just
thinking to myself and I was doing my
other eyebrow like I'm really in the
mood to have a like leaky eyebrows today
Jenner get that you just want to put a
little bit of extra time and effort into
them and make them look really good and
I feel like this is quite like a dark
intense eye and your eyebrows arms to
match then it's not going to look as
great so because I really want like
sculpted arched brows I'm going to use
my anastasia beverly hills dipbrow in
soft brown and i'm going to use the
sigma e o six liner brush to do my brows
i love using this brush to do my
eyebrows and I'm really just going to
like sculpt to Matt and extend them to
how I want and then when I get towards
the front you guys know I really just
love to like feather them out I was just
going to be used what's left on the
brush to do this run I never want to
apply and then I'm just going to take my
Anastasia Beverly Hills concealer this
is in the shade 1.5 and I'm just going
to use this to sculpt out underneath my
brow because I've been really loving
that kind of look and Diskin see that I
find on me isn't too lights I'm not like
looking up with krylon or anything it's
a really nice color I like to use
underneath
my neighbor okay with browser that's
done we can now move on to eyes so what
I like to start off doing if I'm going
to be having something breed black on my
eyelid is to take either a really creamy
pencil or even like a gel eyeliner so
this is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
darkside waterproof gel eyeliner but
it's like a gel eyeliner pencil so it's
almost a mix of both
basically just any black face that's
quite easy to blend so that is tend to
that does tend to be either like a Paint
Pot or a creamy pencil so I really like
this one for that and I'm just going to
start off a game-time like lash line you
want to start and work from the bottom
up I'm not going to take it too
drastically into the inner corner either
I literally just just feel like about
there and then I'm going to take a brush
like this this is a big duo fiber brush
and it from NYX is their brush in either
0 9 or 6p I can't quite tell and then
I'm just going to use that and kind of
blend it downwards and just buff it in
so you can see it starts to diffuse
itself out and you can tug on your skin
as well as that helps you to blend but
we are going to be packing a black eye
shadow like on the top so you don't need
to worry about it being super neat or
anything you just kind of want a good
dark space or the black for eyeshadow
today I'm using all of Anna palette and
this is the meet matrimonial palette
from the farm I'm going to start off
with this color in my crease going over
still some of the places that we've
placed that color but it is kind of
going above as you can see and for me
warm I'm using warm tones for this look
just because they are flatter my eye a
lot more you could totally start with a
small cooler toned brown and use graves
and stuff to kind of smoke this out it's
totally up to you and what suits your
eyes
then I'm going to take this kind of very
warm brown shade here and it is the meat
Kumal shade and just use that decided
deepen up the crease on a slightly
smaller brush this time and just again
just using that black eyeliner that we
placed down and just making sure
everything is all blended together so
you can get some inner to outer corner
and then I'm also just going to go back
in with the brush that we use to apply
the initial warm brown shade just to
make sure everything is super blended
together our final crease color is going
to be this shade here again from the
same palette and this is in the shade
and that reads again just kind of
packing and then that's buffing
everything and then to really intensify
like everything dies on the lid so
basically the black we're going to take
the black shade from the same palette
which is literally the blackest black
I've ever used and it is called meat I'm
going to meet the whole time I mean Matt
Matt anid is this one and I'm just going
to take a small flat shader brush this
is the Sigma II 20
back that on everywhere that we placed
see a black eyeliner as our base you can
just see the black shadows that we put
on top is now like super intensified I
do the small brush just because the
inner corner and stuff can be quite hard
you don't want to place too much and not
be able to blend it in and take it away
so I always like to use a small brush
and doing anything on the lid just
because I don't want to like I said
place too much product down and then
just kind of patting it in between the
two like the lid and the crease and now
you can go back in with like um you can
even use all the shades or just like a
couple of the brown shades just to
really make sure that's buffed in and
there's no harsh line because black ops
II is such like an intense color
then once you're happy with kind of
everything in the way it's all blended
out I'm going to take this cream matte
white shade here from the same palette
and just use that to highlight my inner
corner and for a bone because this is
such an intense look I kind of don't
want to lose a lot my eyes click to kind
of close my name's I do want to build
lips now feel free to go ahead go ahead
and add winged eyeliner you want to
personally I'm going to add like a big
pair of lashes to this so I don't think
eyeliner is necessary but you totally
can I mean you've got the pate to be
able to do it without kind of panicking
anything I just connect to me personally
my eye like if I'm going to go like
black all over my eyes like I don't feel
like I need eyeliner I am going to take
these black pencil eyeliner that we used
on the lid and just tight line just
tight line my eye because like I said I
am going to be applying lashes and I
feel like has not got liner to kind of
hide lash line and this kind of helps so
I'm literally going to go ahead and
apply mascara this is the Maybelline the
colossal go extreme leather black so
it's super black and then I'm going to
apply it luscious fine lashes I'm going
to take these from the other Beauty they
are in the style number 13 I thought
they were kind of super intense and
dramatic to go with this look so this is
what the finished eyes look like with
lashes on as you can see I didn't really
feel like any to any wind I don't know
anything so now we can move on to the
skin so now we can take the tape off I
always like that so it's not flying it
taking that off I've been really loving
at the moment applying a little bit of
an oil before hand nothing that's going
to separate anything to literally just a
couple of drops and this one is from
L'Oreal is their extraordinary facial
oil and then I just threw that and the
damp Beauty Blender kind of like sponge
that into my skin I feel like it just
kind of really hydrates your skin and
then when you put a primer on top it
just all sits really nicely I find
probably wouldn't recommend this if you
already have oily skin you want to avoid
any adding any excess oils if you've got
dry to normal skin I definitely
recommend just trying it
so timer I'm going to take the models on
face base this is the color correcting
line and this one is for radiance
like pink it's going to get a couple of
chumps about and you guys know me I'm
just going to bust that and it's good
I'm to foundation today I'm going to
take the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation in the shade sand
I've got like a tan developing at the
moment so my face is a little bit
lighter than in my body as usual press
it into the skin this time using the
tapered end of the beach bending on the
bottom that we just used to apply the
oil how you guys look in the newcomer by
the way so once that's all blended in
you can go in with your concealer and
today I'm using deep well I'm using it
the Maybelline fit me concealer and if
it's in the shade 15 something is quite
like kind of feeling quite like upright
under-eye this literally applies like a
dream and again I don't like to take it
all the way up so I like to use a little
brush to do that but I'm going to take
up the sides of my nose and then it
could render elements you're going to
take the newest Sigma sponge I'm not
sure this is out yet but I've been at
really really really loving this the
flat edge of it makes it really easy to
like got the side of your nose and like
along any things like this standing
before we set it with powder I'm just
gonna cream contour fix and ceiling
texture glam and extra to disappear
morphe concealer in the shade caramel
actually I've not really convinced this
is quite like a warm color but just kind
of cream bronzing now I just said take a
direct fibre brush to blend it all out
and this is a little short handled one
from Mac it is the 197 short-handled
really just warming up the skin and I
just like to go in and just use the
sponge that you for concealer just to
make sure it's not too in ten other
cream bronze okay so that is all the
creams I'm going to put on my fave from
now just going to go ahead and set
everything in place with powder and then
I'll be back okay now everything is set
in place
I feel like subscribe the cream bronzer
has kind of really launching out by
schools by am just going to kind of set
the bronzer in place a little bit with a
bronzer and this is the a cargo of
bronzer in medium and I'm going to apply
it with a duo fiber brush because I
definitely really intense like I said
this is just like going to be acting as
a dark powder to set that cream bronzer
in place concentrating that mainly at
the bottom so acts like a bit more of a
contour then I am going to take be a
better champagne pop bit pan and this is
the one with Prosecco pot and this
blusher is in the shade armor I only
going to be using both I'm just going to
start with the blusher I really love
this blush your shade because it's
nothing too intense and then take a bit
of the Prosecco club
now how much you can apply one more
highlighter just because I want it to be
a little bit more intense in that and
this is from models own it is the color
golden sand number 10 but I'm owning
under take the same brush we're just
kind of concentrates on like the highest
point so literally just press it on top
just there now I don't really like
putting anything black in my waterline
so I'm going to take a really really
really dark brown and this is coffee a
pencil from that stand living palette
that we were using earlier I am going to
take that map read color which was like
a blueberry dark brown and I'm going to
take it on like a little fluffier shader
brush like this because I want it to be
really kind of fast and I'm just going
to use baking exactly motions across my
lower lashline but making sure I've
really pushed it up into the lash line
on a and little fluffy brush I'm going
to take that original transition color
that we use and like diffuse out the
bottom then I just went ahead and
applied bottom lash of mascara and these
are the finished eyes moving on to lips
personally because this is such an
intense oily look I don't want to wear
anything that's going to take away from
it and I've been doing a lot of colored
lip looks lately so forgive me this one
is going to be a nude so it's in line my
lips I'm going to take subculture
lipliner from Matt then it just fill in
my lips I'm going to take it student
liquid lipstick in caramel Oh
now you can just leave it as a matte lip
but because we've got all my eyes I kind
of want something that glossy you guys
know me so I'm going to take the l'oreal
disco-ball lip gloss - let's finish this
lid off and this is the finished look so
this is the finished makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
