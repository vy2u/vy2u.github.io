haha
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I have done my first installment
of prom makeup and this is kind of the
ultimate DIY prom makeup tutorial I go
through loads of tips and tricks on how
to make things a lot easier for yourself
if you're doing your own makeup so if
you like the look of this makeup look
and please keep watching okay so to
start off with if you guys have watched
my channel for a while you guys know I
always like to do my eyebrows before I
do my foundation now this is because I
sometimes find when you apply your
foundation and then do your brows the
product doesn't really show up as true
to color in the sense that you're kind
of mixing whatever you're putting on on
top of foundation and sometimes it can
be really hard to get the color payoff
that you want especially if you're like
me and you have to extend your brow
slightly so I always do it on to bare
skin first because that's how I get the
strongest color now for probably
obviously when your eyebrows to stay on
and last all evening and canopy
sweat-resistant and stuff the product I
really like to use is my anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in medium brown
and i mix it well i don't I do like one
drop of the inglot duraline this makes
the product super creamy and it makes it
water resistant I think it's water
resistant yeah so duraline mix with a
makeup product of your choice creates a
liquid waterproof formula so it's
literally not going to budge and it also
makes it a lot creamier and easier to
apply so I really recommend that for
like parties or nights out or in this
case prom I concentrate that product
mainly on the tail of my brow and then
through the front of my brow I take
something a bit lighter either a lighter
dip brow or in this case I'm going to
use the Kiko precision eyebrow pencil in
the color 0-3 which is slightly lighter
as you can see without any product in
your brow is slightly lighter and
through the front so it's just going to
keep that kind of natural appearance and
that's how you kind of get that gradient
brow kind of speed throughout the
process of how I do one eyebrow just so
you can see and then I'll go ahead and
do the other one off camera because I
know I always do my brows off-camera but
I'll show you kind of speeding through
how I do it because I mean everyone does
this differently but you guys interested
see how I do it then watch what's next
now I'm going to go ahead and start
doing my eye makeup the shape and style
of this kind of look is going to be
slightly winged out and for me I find it
easier to just go ham with my eye
shadows and then create the line with a
white but if you guys struggle with that
or you don't even get your angles right
this is when you would apply your tape
or whatever it is that you find easiest
to create that shape but for me I'm just
going to go ahead and start panel eyes
and then I will wipe it all the way at
the end to prime my eyes I want
something that's not going to create on
my lid and it's going to be sort of
flesh toned so that I'm using my trusty
Mac Pro Longwear Paint Pot and I'm going
to go ahead and apply that all over my
eyes I am going to go ahead and do one
eye of camera after this just so I can
play around with the shadows and kind of
see the look that I want to do and then
I'll be back to show you how I do the
other eye but first let's prime
you
as you can see it gives you a really
good blank canvas to kind of put your
eyeshadows on it's kind of got rid of
any discoloration I had on my island and
now anything that I put on the top is
going to show up true to color and lasts
all day because on did kind of get
naturally oily so this kind of helps to
prevent that so now I'm going to go
ahead and do one eye of camera and then
I'll be back to show you how I did it so
this is the look that I came up with
I kept it kind of shimmery champagne e
pinky kind of colors I think that's kind
of the most popular look for prom
obviously I do plan to do some more cool
tone one so if you like this I look then
keep watching to see how I did it okay
so by now you should have applied your
tape if you want to use tape but I'm
just going to go straight in with the
first eyeshadow so I'm keeping it warm
toned so I'm taking Anastasia Beverly
Hills burnt orange this is literally my
favorite crease color at the moment it's
a really really soft light brown so any
alternatives like Mac texture or makeup
geek creme brulee or something like that
and I'm just taking a fluffy brush and
where you put your brush first is where
you're going to apply the most product
so don't start in the center of your
crease because that's not where you want
it to be the darkest you want it to go
from light to dark so keep it
concentrated on your like outer third
and I find it easier to look down while
doing this because then I can really get
into my socket and see where my socket
actually is so that's a little tip so
taking a fluffy brush and just going
back and forth to start with and then
with what's left on the brush taking
that into the crease in kind of
windscreen wiper motions you don't want
to take this product too high either
like up towards your brow because that's
when you can start to look a bit draggy
I love drag makeup but prom I feel
that's not kind of the look that you
want you want to keep things very lifted
so you don't want to take it too high
which is why looking down and kind of
help because you can see where your
socket isn't it allows you to kind of
see where you're going with the product
like that you could have used a bronzer
for that like that's the kind of initial
warm transition shade that were after
and then you can build that up as much
as you want so I'm just going to take a
little bit more by always tap of excess
product on my brush then I'm going in
with the shade noona from the Urban
Decay Naked 3 palette I feel like this
palette if you're doing your own prom
makeup is like a go-to if you like rose
gold soft tones because it's like the
perfect color is filled with them so I'm
just taking a slightly smaller precise
fluffy brush this is a sigma e25 and
again using the same motions but this
time not taking it quite so high up
because this is where you want the
gradient to be so again kind of applying
it on top of where we put that shadow on
the lid but they're not taking it any
higher then I'll soak it and you're
going to drag this out because you
should either have tape or you're doing
what I'm doing kind of going freehand
but you can wipe it away so you can be
as messy as you want I feel that kind of
takes the pressure off because you don't
want to be stressed out on your prom
especially with makeup taking that into
the crease but not taking it too high up
because once you've built up the
intensity that you want go back in with
your fluffy brush with I haven't got any
excess product on this and I'm just
going to diffuse the line between those
two shades it's all about diffusing it
all together making it look as soft as
possible and you can take a tiny bit
more of that lunar color just to build
up the intensity just slightly
now for the lid color because we're only
going to be using three crease covers
and the next one is slightly darker and
I always apply the darkest color after
I've done my lid color but a little
trick I'm going to go back in with my
painting with a concealer brush just
taking a little bit extra because
sometimes after you apply your crease
colors it kind of gets it kind of can
get onto your lid and kind of get rid of
the brightness that that primer
originally had on your lid so I'm taking
a concealer brush insegment this is the
f17 and I'm just applying that
essentially back over the empty lid
space now you can use this if you can
see kind of go really up into your
crease and always create a cut crease
look but essentially this is just going
to act as a little bit of an adhesive
for when you put your lid color on and
then just as you get towards the crease
color just kind of drag it out maybe Pat
it with your fingers slightly so it's
like diffused for the lid color you
could stick with your Urban Decay
palette and use any of the shimmery
colors on there but I found this pigment
from Inglot which is the number 39 and
oh my god I thought this was the perfect
prom color it's like a shimmery like
baby pink color and I was I saw it in my
drawer and I was like yes this is the
color I want to use but I don't want it
to transfer onto my lid or anything like
that so again I recommend looking down
when using loose shimmery products then
as you get towards the kind of crease
colors you definitely want to be
applying any more so just kind of like
softly dragging it into it I'm then
going back in with the Sigma e25 brush
that we used to apply noonah and just
dragging down between the shimmery lid
shade and then where we did apply the
nooner just to kind of diffuse them
together and take it through the crease
lightly just to soften up where the
pigments
so the darkest color I'm going to be
using is red from Anastasia Beverly
Hills Mac Swiss chocolate is really
really similar so if you have that
that's maybe a slightly more accessible
alternative I will link everything that
I've used down below and I'm just taking
this blending brush from Sigma it's an
e36 and it is super as you can see super
tapered and super precise so this is
going to allow me to really concentrate
the product and be really kind of
minimal with it so I'm just going to
contract this furthest part of my crease
going backwards and forwards and then
with what's left on the product just
take that slightly up into the socket
and back down again looking down into a
mirror makes this a lot easier then
taking the original fluffy brush that we
used the initial transition color on I'm
just going to go and literally above
everything in back-and-forth circular
motions especially here where you are
applying the most product like that now
for the lid color you can leave it there
but seeing like my friends when they
freelance and stuff and I just love it
anyway it just looks amazing when you
apply a bit of glitter especially as you
guys know my favorite this is Mac reflex
pearl the reflex from Mac there's like
teal red pink gold pearl they just look
stunning applied in the right way so I'm
going to show you how I would apply the
glitter so obviously when applying
glitter it needs something to add heed
to you could use mac fix+ and spray your
eye and then spray the brush that's got
glitter on and then Pat it on I don't
have any fix+ at the moment so I'm going
to be taking this this is a liquid eye
primer from makeup revolution it comes
with their little foiled eyeshadows so I
think they're like most popular one is
the rose gold one or something but these
come in their little part so what I do
is either apply it to a surface or the
back of my hand a few drops of that
liquid eye primer
taking a synthetic brush I'm going to
look down and press that essentially
where I want the glitter to go so that's
basically just on top of that shimmer
that we put on from inglot so using the
same brush pick up some of the reflex I
always like to tap off most of it and
then look down and just Pat it on the
top the key is to be super super light
hundred with this
then going back and move the Urban Decay
palette I'm taking this kind of hair
called strange and I'm going to use this
to highlight my brow bone and my inner
corner now if you felt like you took
your eyeshadow too high this is a really
good technique as like it almost acts as
an eraser like everything where you put
your brush first it's going to apply the
most product so I'm taking it straight
on the arch of my brow and then just
using windscreen wiper motions back and
forth to highlight and then taking it
down slightly and as you can see as you
can see it kind of erases the initial
transition color slightly so you felt
like you took it too while you are too
harsh this is a good trick to help you
kind of clean that up after this is time
for liner so if you've got tape on then
um you can either keep your tape on and
do a liner then but because I've not
used tape and I'm using a wipe I'm now
going to create the kind of wing and
that's going to act as my base for when
I do the liner so I'm just going to
clean up and create the wing if you're
doing about me and you need a guide I
always aimed like the tail of my brow
and that kind of gives me a good kind of
like I said guide as to what angle my
shadow should be
now when it comes to eyeliner I feel
like this is where everyone panics but
don't panic because I learn a consents
you're fierce and that's when it all
goes friendly wrong and your eyes
watering and before you know it it's
like time to go to prom and you're
sobbing because your eyeliners not gone
the way that you wanted it to so for me
I would recommend just using whatever
you can do it with like don't start
trying maybe new things if you're not
comfortable with it because I Logan can
just be so so so tricky but for me when
I'm going out I always use a gel and my
go-to is the Inglot number 77 it's like
the blackest one that I found and I also
mix it with my juror line to make it one
creamier and super easy to apply and to
water resistance if my eyes start
watering or whatever my eyeliner is
going nowhere so if that's something
that you suffer with then maybe maybe
try this out a lot of people like to use
an angled brush but I like to something
super super thin so this is the Sigma e
11 the Mac 209 or 210 brush is also
amazing so like anything else the first
place you put your brush it's going to
apply the most product so for me I'm
just going to start in the middle of my
eye draw it down then do the inner part
and then the wing but because it's such
a lengthy process I am going to speed
through you'll be able to see kind of
what I'm doing as I'm doing it just at a
faster pace then it normally would be
then I always go back in with my wife
and just go along the bottom and just
sharpen it up so once that's done and
you can finally breathe again I'm now
just going to go ahead and apply mascara
I'm going to be applying false eyelashes
I think with these kind of looks they do
really complement them but if you're not
used to them and you don't want to this
is when I would probably curl my lashes
and just apply a really good coat of a
decent mascara either maybe something
waterproof or just something that you're
comfortable with and you know that
doesn't irritate your eyes I'm going to
be using the Loreal sculpt one I am in
love with this one but again like I said
I am going to be applying false lashes
so for me this part isn't what mascara I
use isn't really crucial so for false
eyelashes something to kind of
complement the look for me it's
something kind of winged out nothing too
dramatic so you can still kind of see
the eye shadow that's going on so I've
chosen these ones from volute they're in
the style mama knows best and they're
part of their silk collection a for me I
like the perfect prom lash because
they're not too long either they're
super super natural-looking so if you
want to get your hands on these go to
the below website I will link these it
down below and you can use the code
Rachel Leary or I think it's 15% off so
order them now in time for prom
now with these lashes they do have kind
of two extra little bits at the end so
if you have like a breed egg lids and I
wouldn't recommend that's what that's
kind of for so you can stick them on but
for me I have to trim that bit off and
trim that bit off and then they're the
perfect size for me but don't be scared
to cut your own lashes the worst thing
is is when they're maybe too long for
you and they start really irritating you
here or here and that's when your eye
makeup starts to run and it's literally
awful I've been there so don't be scared
to just kind of pop them on your lid
first and just measure them up to make
sure that they are the most comfortable
for you if you put the lash on straight
away that's when it moves around and
that's when it becomes so so difficult
for yourself when applying lashes when
they start moving around it kind of
gives you too much control of where they
go
if you if you just let them get tacky
and then you place them down in the
center of your lash and then use a pair
of tweezers to stick it down either side
that is what I find to be the most
effective method I do have a video on
how to apply false lashes so I'm going
to go ahead and pop these on and then
the eyes are kind of half all mostly
done so this is what the eyes look like
with the lashes on as you can see for me
I think they add like the perfect amount
of natural volume there nothing too
much' nothing too scary or intimidating
and because they're velu they are super
super kind of wispy and natural looking
so I am obsessed with them so now moving
on to the skin so if a problem you want
your makeup to last the longest time so
what you really want to focus on is a
good base if you're like me or you're
getting a spray tan or anything you also
want to color match yourself correctly
if I put a foundation on that was the
color of my skin right now I would look
ridiculous in pictures because I would
have this tad neck and a pale face so
you do want to color match but to start
off with I'm going to use post shave
balm this I found to be the best primer
if you want your makeup to last if
you've if you watched like
nikkietutorials like original kind of
discovery of this she says that it's got
this ingredient in it that basically
anything that you put on this top it's
going to cling to it and that is what
you want with your makeup you want
something that's going to cling and last
all day so I'm just putting a bit on the
back of my hand and using this Real
Techniques expert face brush to just
buff that into my skin
so now it's time for foundation and for
me when it comes to events like this and
proms and stuff when I know there's
going to be a lot of photos taken or
something you want something that's got
no SPF in SPF is what gives white
flashbacks and pictures and can kind of
completely burrow in a picture and make
you look paler than you actually are
I also think for me you want something
that's got like maybe a medium to full
coverage if you do prefer something
slightly natural that's totally up to
you I just find I don't know if it's
just on my skin or in general something
that's likely to share doesn't
necessarily last as long so I'm going to
be using the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
stick I'm going to mix two together just
because that's how I'm going to get my
perfect color of CV put one in your
color that's it that says you mixing two
but anything that says it's HD tends to
have no SPF in so it doesn't necessarily
have to be from makeup ever but if
you're searching for foundations search
for a HD foundation so I'm mixing the
shades one to seven and one five three
together so I'm just going to do a
couple lines okay one to seven and then
on the top do the one five three and you
might be thinking oh my god you're
literally painting it on but I'm going
to use this all over my face so it's not
just for this part but where you do
apply the product again I keep saying
this but that's where it's going to be
the most pigmented and for me that's
kind of this part of my face anyway and
I'm just going to take a buffing brush
this one's from BH Cosmetics and just
pop that into the skin a hundred percent
make sure you're taking it down your
neck you don't want an awkward
foundation line in your pictures
and obviously just be mindful of when
you're applying it above your brows
because obviously don't want to wipe
them off so next up is concealer I'm
going to be get taking this highlighting
and sculpting duo from NYX so it's kind
of a contour and highlight and water I'm
just going to apply that in the kind of
upside down triangle motion and then you
could have either used that little brush
to do this but I'm going to take a super
before suck learn it a super precise
concealer brush pick up some of the
excess product from underneath here and
just use that underneath my liner and
drag it down so when I'm buffing it out
I don't have to use like a big brush
when going under such a precise area and
let's just allows me to get it super
sharp but then for the rest of the
concealer I'm just going to be using a
brush and I'm not dragging I'm dabbing
and then I just like to go back in with
my foundation brush and just kind of DAB
overall and just make sure everything is
kind of blended in to play lend it in
now you have oily skin I'd made me stick
to powder contouring but I love the
appearance of a cream contour I think it
blends so much nicer and looks a lot
nice in pictures so I'm just going to
take the other side of that NYX
highlighting sculpting duo and just draw
a line you kind of towards the top of my
ear down here and not really going past
the color in the most part of my eye
like that along the tops of my forehead
and again on the other side
so I'm just going to take a duo fiber
brush and buff that in blending upwards
then again I just go back in with my
foundation brush and especially on my
forehead just make sure it's all blended
in nicely now to make sure nothing moves
and everything is just set in place I am
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder this is honestly a
godsend for prom especially if you're
doing your own makeup you don't
necessarily have to bake or anything I
just find this is the most amazing
powder to set everything in place it
doesn't have any flashback I stay away
from HD powders for prom they have the
worst flashback ever whereas this one is
just translucent setting powder so I'm
taking a tapered brush because that's
how if I easy to get underneath my eye
and we're going to use this on
everywhere that you mint might get oily
so it has to be around the nose and your
forehead but and also essentially
basically the posts that we highlighted
with the concealer so I'm just dabbing
that underneath my eye and like I said
here on my nose for me it gets awful my
forehead down the bridge of my nose on
my chin I always kind of just dust it
underneath the contour as well like that
so that's just set all the creams and
pastes going to stop it from creasing
stop you from getting oily and like when
you sweat like you're sweating in stock
or anything like that is just gonna lock
it all in place it is a godsend now to
essentially set the contour in place I'm
just going to lightly apply a bit of
bronzer on the top I'm it taking this
one from Bourjois it's the gold running
powder it has a slight golden shimmer to
it which i think is really really pretty
and just taking a big fluffy brush my
god smells amazing as well topping
excess off because the worst thing you
could possibly do now is just whack it
on and just ruin everything that you did
also find that powder kind of helps give
you a really smooth canvas so everything
should kind of softly blend into the
skin but like I said just taking a big
fluffy brush with the bronzer and just
lightly
dusting over where you applied the cream
contour but I'm being a really light
hand with my hand because it's so much
easier to apply more than to take away
I'm also going to take this opportunity
just to brush that all down here and use
it to define my drill slightly like that
so for blusher I am taking my favorite
it is Mac warm so I'm just gonna I just
think it adds the most gorgeous gorgeous
glow to the skin and I'm obsessed
because I'm not really a massive blush
person but I love that one now for
highlighting I'm gonna apply to you
because I think highlighting is now like
this massive thing and everyone wants to
be a beaming from the heavens and also I
just like the two different shades of
this one so this one is from hourglass
and it is that euphoric strobe light so
it actually has a kind of pearly pink
undertone to it and I thought this one
would tighten really nicely with the I
show that we've done and it almost looks
more kind of bronzy on the skin and just
buffing that onto the cheekbones and
kind of up the temple slightly and with
this same highlight I'm going to take
that down the bridge of my nose just
slightly and on my Cupid's bow now you
can just leave it there but I am going
to take a driver of the mary lou manizer
from the balm just on the top top parts
of your cheekbones yeah now before when
we want to lips me to finish off the
eyes so I'm going to take this chroma
graphic pencil from Mac it is in the
color nc15 nw20 and just put that in my
waterline as this kind of really opens
up your eyes and I kind of want my eyes
to look really big and kind of open for
like pictures and stuff rather than
using something kind of more harsh like
a dark brown or a black and then all I'm
going to do is take a pencil brush like
this
take the original transition edit the
original transition color which in this
case was burnt orange from anastasia
beverly hills so you can use whatever
you use as your initial transition color
and just buff that on the lower lash
line then just go ahead and apply bottom
lash mascara and that is the eyes
finished now to finish up onto the lips
i kind of want to keep it fairly natural
and to kind of tie it in with the soft
kind of pink going on on the eyes so I'm
taking my my OCC lip pencil in the shade
trick and just using that to draw around
my lips like that then for lipstick I'm
taking it the Mac mineralized lipstick
in pure pout so something it's just a
tiny bit lighter than the lip liner I
think most people for events and stuff
would probably recommend wearing and
that lipstick but at the end of the day
I think you're probably going to be
reapplying anything that you've got in
your lips anyway you're talking you're
eating or drinking so if you want to
gloss your lip go the glossy just be
prepared to maybe have to touch up a bit
more than your friends and then finally
to finish off the lip I'm going to put a
gloss this is the NYX butter gloss in
fortune cookie just to lighten it up a
little bit and that is the finished look
now to set everything in place I'm going
to go ahead and apply my Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and then that is
the look completed so this is the
finished look guys I really hope you
