it will be but at the moment it's not a
voiceover I thought as its 2015 I will
introduce my videos it's not face to
face is it but like I will talk to you
to introduce my videos just because a
lot of you guys have been requesting in
the comments and I feel this way I feel
like I'm actually talking to you I can
get to know you guys a bit better and
you guys can get to see kind of what I'm
like in a way I don't know I've been not
really scared but like I always thought
it was a bit weird just to sit and talk
to a camera but you guys want to see it
I just have to get over it and I feel
like a lot of people who make youtube
videos probably thought their first
talking to the camera video was gonna be
a bit weird but I'm sure I'll get used
to it but today I'm just gonna be doing
an eye makeup tutorial
using the BH Cosmetics party girl After
Hours palette which looks like so it's
got a range of like sparkly diamond
shades here lots of gold and also a lot
of cool tones like purples and blues but
today I'm gonna be focusing mainly on
the bronzy tones and I'm gonna be doing
this I makeup look which is like you'll
see a bronzy smokey cat eye and I think
this palette normally retails for about
20 dollars but I've just checked the
website and at the moment it is
half-price and grab it while you can
because it's such amazing palette and
for the price these eyeshadows are so
pigmented so I'm gonna leave all of be
ages social
and their website down below I live
directly way you can get this pallets
you guys can check the mother yeah so so
let's start I'm taking some scotch tape
and place them on the back of my hand to
remove the initial stickiness it's it's
not going to cause any tension on my
under eye area if I'm placing this on
about a 35 to 45 degree angle on the
corner of my eye this is just going to
catch any fallout and allow us to have
enough proof straight cat eye look and
then applying a base all over the lid to
improve the longevity of our shadows and
get rid of any discoloration on the lid
now for the main feature of the video
this is the BH party no After Hours
palette it contains all the shades you
would need for a dramatic party look and
is at this moment only $10 so I'll leave
a direct link for this down below the
initial transition shade I'm taking this
warm light brown shadow on a fluffy
crease brush and being quite rough as
with the tape it's going to give us the
shape we want no matter what we do by
making sure to bring it out and taking
it quite high up into the crease
and then taking this medium matte brown
shade to further deepen the crease on a
smaller crease brush making sure to
concentrate most of the product on the
outer crease to really emphasize this
toilet
going in with an even deeper dark-brown
I'm using this to create that wing out
cat eye and because of all the different
shades that we fuse it's going to create
a gradient effect again only keeping
this color on the outer most part of the
crease
now if the lid I'm taking this shimmery
light gold color all over the eye and
keeping it mainly Inlet in our heart
just because we're gonna go in with a
different shade of a shimmery color to
add to the gradient effect which is this
partly brown satin color and yeah so I'm
putting this almost where we're putting
those dark matte shades but more onto
the lids at all of the colors flow as a
gradient from light to dark at all parts
of the eye using this matte black I'm
finally deepening the crease in a cat
eye motion for the last time so when we
apply the liner later on it looks more
put-together and blended
finally I'm highlighting the inner
corner with this white gold shade to
open up the eye
now it's time to remove the tape and I
love this part because you know you're
gonna get that perfect cut edge to your
shadow every time and because I wanted
this to be all about the eyes I did my
brows and face off-camera and when I
watched this footage back I actually
laughed at the before and after because
of how pale my face was but I'm really
sorry that it suddenly got really dark
my face took longer than I thought but
it gets that I promise I'm now using a
small shader brush and taking the medium
brown shade along my lower lash line and
buffing it out with the initial warm
shade now for liner I had to cut off the
footage out because I literally just
wasn't in the show as you can see I've
kept it really thin over the lid and as
I get to the wing it that's where I'm
thickening it to really emphasize the
cat eye look I then just added mascara
and you can keep it that way or add
false lashes as you can see here but
that is it I really hope you enjoyed
thank you for watching and I'll see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
