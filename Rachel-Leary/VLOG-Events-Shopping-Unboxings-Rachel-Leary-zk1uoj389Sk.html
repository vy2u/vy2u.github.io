get to film on this lanes man a lot
today but I thought I would tell you
about what I got up to sorry I've
changed occasions now because the
kitchen lighting was annoying me but
yeah basically I went let's see from the
footage I went to the YouTube space in
London and had a meeting with my account
manager and then I was asked to speak on
a panel basically with a couple of other
youtubers and basically talk to a bunch
of marketing people that work for
vehicle from around the world and just
tell them about my youtube journey and
stuff like that and there wasn't really
a lot I could vlog it was quite an
intimate relaxed setting so I didn't
really get the opportunity to film in
there but it was so-so
I don't really know the word is like
crazy to think that they'd come here to
listen to me and they'd asked me to come
in and speak and that's all because of
you guys so big thank you I guess just
cuz obviously wouldn't be here if it
wasn't to you guys so big gutted I
didn't film any of it but it was just
kind of the questions there they wanted
to know so like about my youtube journey
so far tips I would give to other people
what it is that I like and don't like
about YouTube and just stuff like that
so that was really fun and I've just got
home as long as they ever so the next
thing I think you'll probably see I'll I
got a couple of packages so I'll show
you what I got in them but the next
thing you'll probably see is a sleek
event that I'm going to on Thursday
hopefully with a few familiar faces and
I'm going to try and vlog as much as I
can of that and yeah but let me show you
some of the packages I got today also
they gave me these beautiful flowers as
like a thank you for talking which was
so unnecessary it's more like actually
giving them flowers for thank you for
having me but yeah they gave me one of
this bouquet of flowers and a crema
cause I'm not really sure that is but
still amazing but I did a big lush order
so I bought these myself let me get them
oh yeah I did a big lash order of like
red cherry and ardell lashes so I go
or two pairs of 43 lashes to five to
three so these ones are a bit more like
winged out actually no these ones are a
bit more winged out these are also more
rockefeller length one I'm sure you'll
see me leave them in a tutorial I was
just thinking I could do it a lot more
of affordable lashes on my channel so I
can mix it up slightly and then I got
three pairs of the Adel glamour one one
three ones so they're really winged out
and full kind of money of like
Kardashian lashes so I was really
excited to try them because the only
ones I've tried from ardell are like the
demi wispies and the wispy so I saw
these and thought I would give them a go
how feeling I saw them on desi Perkins
snapchat as well so I got them and then
I got this package from Coastal Scents
I think is with this incredible brush
set so I didn't need any more brushes
and so ever well my brushes oh my god
and excited to see holy moly I've had
good things about Coastal Scents so I'm
a pretty damn excited with these and
then I can lie look like a light purple
color
don't the color translate for lighting
in his pretty bad yeah but you know how
I get on with those for sure so yeah I'm
just gonna eat my dinner now and kind of
relax think I'm gonna I uploaded a video
yesterday by the time I'm seeing it I
uploaded my 2015 of beauty favorites
yesterday so I'm gonna go and reply to
all the comments on that because I
uploaded it pretty late so I kind of
went straight to bed and then I was up
straightaway going off to London so I'm
gonna go and reply to the comments on
that there I will see you at the next
thing that I'm lugging so
hey guys so it is Thursday the 21st I
think it is today and I was just getting
ready for the slick event I'm going to
tonight and I thought I would show you
what it's on my face even though
probably by now I posted an Instagram
about it maybe well yeah I thought I
would show you what is on my face before
I head out let me zoom you in so for
skin I have mixed my I've mixed my Kat
Von D lock-it tattoo foundation in the
shade medium before with Mac Studio Fix
fluid in NC 35 I think and I've used my
NARS radiant creamy concealer in
Chantilly which is like the palest one
I've said it obviously with my Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder which
I'm in love with bronzed EU bronzed
using I think I put in here the Tom Ford
golden bronzer on my eyes on the lid
I've gone from light to dark mixing this
shade from the Tom Ford golden make
palettes I've mixed that one with this
one from the Cognex able palette I think
and then a bunch of Mac eyeshadows in
the crease I think I used texture Brown
script and a bit of corduroy out down
Brown I think that is and then I
prattled I crushed a bit at this Urban
Decay like moon shadow I think they're
called or like what are they it's the
more glittery ones and this one is in
space cowboy which I'm in love with it's
like hmm well it's basically why is my
focus so that it's basically like you
can see like a champagne E glittery
color and I love it so much and I've
highlighted using the Solstice palette
keep calling it saliste solstice palette
this one and on my lips I have Mac
stripped-down pencil with Tom Ford nude
vanilla and this gloss from sleek in the
shade fool's gold so yeah that is my
makeup look for this evening and the
next time I probably film will be at the
event also on my way and I can't wait to
see everyone I think there's a few
people that I know that going so I will
try and vlog with them but yeah I'll see
you in a bit
Gina's coming at the perfect Instagram
with g9 Katy
like to be your friends like
gone Tina
I feel myself eating it by some Majesty
behavior
privacy's
keep mean gene are allergic to nuts say
balls are inputting
to your buns
disgraceful okay it's where our lunch
with soap and glory and this is the glam
slam board games I haven't seen it
inside the first this is so cool it
looks like a cake
oh my god this is it kind of like oh my
god I'll be at home so is it what is it
what a board game with the similar guns
there's like safe eyebrows in it and you
need one from each category
I want you put one in each and you can
go to the doll but the mac and cheese
kind of earns it but we'll pretend it
was looks good what was yours again so I
just finished up my lunch meeting with
Tobin glorious that you saw before he
saw the Horde game that they're coming
out with with all the new cosmetics oh I
can't wait to show you guys that I had
just bought a
I'm gonna cry if you report better
market
I'm just taking around but I'm actually
obsessed but not a hill I'm not really
like being here before just look at
these noses like I'm obsessed with them
but I'll keep you updated the next video
I might do might be in Friday but yeah
waiting for your mate to try job in the
living room
hey guys so I am back from London now
and I just thought I would show you some
of the bits that I got so one of the
first and like my favorite thing I got
is this bag from Aldo you might
recognize it if you follow the fashion
blogger Sara Ashcroft or that pommy girl
whatever she wears this all the time and
it's been out of stock online for ages
so when I went in and saw it I was
literally and dead it's like a crossbody
let me give up
it's like a crossbody bag with like a
black chain and the black chain
detailing around there and it's the
perfect size but when I go to events and
stuff like that just because I normally
wear my clutch bag and it doesn't fit my
camera in it within without me then not
being able to do it up so this one's got
quite a thick kind of body to it so love
that okay so you know previously in the
vlog I told you I got these really extra
sunglasses from Portobello Road market
well these other let me show you what
they look like on like I'm obsessed with
them and that's why I tweeted you so I
tweeted like I've just bought another
pair of sunglasses because then today I
bought these from the top shop in Oxford
Street today so the key Australia brand
which is really popular and quite hard
to actually put that hard they sell them
on ASOS as well but this style is all
I've never seen it you can still have a
thing for reflective sunglasses so I got
them two also from Topshop I just got
this literally basic blue it's like navy
blue sweater because I really like the
color it's like a really dark navy blue
but it's kind of a bit the green
greenish tinge to it so I got that from
they live it
they were the Tibbets I got from Topshop
then I had a voucher for Victoria's
Secret and I got these oh my god I've
got the hiccups
wouldn't let me try and show you
basically tracky bottoms that say pink
on the side and then pink like up the
lake then from River Island I think I
really obsessed this slush nudey pink
color so I got this like sleep this ugly
v-neck jumper and that's like really
slouchy really comfortable and I like
crosses over at the back like that so
you can see I went for quite a lounge
we're seeing the final clothing item I
got was this coat from Nuala like drapes
like that at the front got rolled up
sleeves doing very good job of showing
these but like a tyrant belt you gotta
get the gist it's kind of like a pop
Parker know what's the word like a Mac
type thing but it's a bit more of a
jersey material and like a really light
gray color because I'm really
integrating like silver at the moment so
I got that - Oh fiercely wasn't gonna be
a shopping trip unless I got some makeup
bit so I got some things from Inglot I
got their sparkling dust I already had
the shade zero three and then I got the
shade zero one a lot more of a lighter
bronze Goldy color and then I got this
eye shadow pigment but it's like a
purpley gold really nice color so I
think I'm gonna do a Valentine's Day
tutorial using this pigment so that was
my shopping I hope you guys enjoyed that
mini haul the next thing I film will be

about so I will fill as much as I can

honored to be here today to teach the
skull school a quick little story lore'l
has been in my life since I was about 3
years old it's half as thin as a regular
foundation but it works really well with
the sculpting palette I'm going to mix
the two shades that I have to number one
and them degree and these products have
a gripping technology in them so they're
made to work very well together over any
icy well I'm kind of nervous this is my
first time contouring your face

those cheekbones

honest of course you know is warming up
