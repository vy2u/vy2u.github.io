random clip here even though this isn't
the day that I've started the vlog I
started the vlog ages ago a bar I don't
think I actually introduced the vlog so
this vlog is essentially just a little
overview of all the events that I went
to I'm just gonna start playing them now
we are nothing more than does search but
your sales
we are we are
he got it right the last thing you think
you saw was me and deals at the next
cosmetics of N and then now just I'm
ready to go meet Jodi and then I'm going
to a it cosmetics event kids those
always asked about a cosmetic stuff and
it's finally coming to DK it's going to
QVC so we're going to this big launch
party and it's such a nice a in London
so yeah right look and I'll keep you
updated
I'm a toe things with the lipstick I
love it cosmetic stuff so much
like the best possible lunch that we can
but what we'd love to do first would you
really share with you our brand video so
you can hear from our founder Jayme
Hurley mo will tell you a little bit
more about her story but that way just
kind of dive right in to what our brand
is all about I'm using the neutral
medium shade there's four shades
so there's light medium tan and deep
it's waterproof and I like to warm it up
on the back of the hand and you just
kind of press it into the skin now when
we bring this product to air on Friday
we cut it comes with a brush that was
designed to do this for you all of our
brushes are designed to do the work for
you because you may be makeup savvy you
may know exactly what you're doing but
there's a lot I'm not gonna dump right
so this brush just design its dual-ended
to just get right up to the lash lines
it is doing the concealer brush you take
it right up under the lash line and I
like to kind of bring it down a little
bit but what is amazing is the other
side you use that to buff it right in
and what is that is it busted into the
skin but it also kind of airbrushes it
out or beautiful and then finally
finally brushes so and it cosmetics
again we design makeup for real women
you guys are super advanced you totally
know everything that's going on and
you're in the know gonna see it
let's stay here it's a mini-tutorial
mini by by under eye tutorial we've just
jokes and otherwise
compelled your own beauty bar
so today I am off to London to do a bit
of shopping but then I actually have a
teeth consultation about potentially
getting some porcelain veneers on my
front teeth I'm not 100% sure on it yet
but I know I always see comments about
my teeth and I've always been it's
always been something that I'm been
conscious of it is such a beautiful day
in London well it will be in such a
beautiful day so I
but with my teeth consultation at the
barback clinic so wish me know I swear
I'm the worst envy blogs but it's the
next day but the teeth consultation went
quite well is a bit more sort of work
that needs to be done I might do like a
whole video on my teeth because there's
so much love behind my teeth that you
guys don't know yeah it went quite well
so um I'll see where it goes from there
and keep you updated I did like a little
shopping spree yesterday so if I
remember I will show you everything I
got but one of the things I did gap that
I did my makeup with this morning it
this Too Faced palette and I wish you
guys could smell it cause it legit
smells like peaches I'm a success with
it um let me know if you want to see a
look with that anytime soon I didn't
fumble look that just sticks I'm in a
rush to get ready because I have a
meeting this morning with a brand so
that should be exciting although the
trains are really like effed up so I'm
really hoping I'm not late so I better
hurry up and leave I'm not gonna be able
to vlog but I'll take my camera with me
just in case I've look any other parts
of the day but this isn't the end of the
vlog I'll continue to show you well no
no wimpy end of the vlog because I want
to show you what I got from the in my
home ok let's just cut that bit and just
see what happens next
hey yes so I just got done with my
meeting up in London and I am just
waiting to get picked up by my dad so I
thought I would kind of talk to you
there about it and show you some of the
bits I got so I had a nice meeting with
LMS which is a skincare brand as I'm
sure you all know and she gives me some
really lovely skincare products so I get
a lot of questions about my skincare and
it's always something that I change up
throughout the seasons and just yeah
like the time of year because that can
really affect your skin so I definitely
want to do an updated skincare routine
or incorporate skincare somehow into a
video so let me know your thoughts on
that cuz I do get a lot of questions
about it and if you guys also want to
know where these glasses are from I got
them from a market on Portobello Road it
does say the brand on the side I'm going
to google it I'll see if they have a
website and if they do I will leave it
down below but I thought I would show
you some of those
pink efforts I got so as you can see she
mainly gets me bits from their advanced
skincare range so loads of bits of both
so loads of it are going to be super
nourishing especially around this time
of year when your skin can get pretty
dry this oh my god this is phenomenal
underneath your makeup it's like
skincare and primer in one if you
struggle with your makeup lasting
because you've got drier skin so you
need your primer to be really nourishing
I seriously recommend this I've tried it
before so I've already actually got one
of these at hire him but yeah she just
gives me some really lovely bit so I
don't like to try these out and I'll let
you know how I got on with them because
skincare something that I I've never
really focused hugely upon just because
I think I just got lazy because I
naturally have quite clear skin which I
am so so so grateful for so I've never
really thought too much into a skincare
routine just because I thought obviously
what I'm doing now is working for my
skin but I've been talking to loads of
people about skincare recently and it
makes such a difference apparently in
the movie that your makeup applies even
if you have clear skin just to get into
a good skincare routine so when I find
one that I'm super super happy with I
definitely want to do a video on it so
let me know in the comments down below
if that's something that you'd be
interested in which I think it is
because I do so a lot of comments about
it but yeah I'm gonna be on my way home
in a bit and when I'm home I will show
you all the makeup I bought yesterday
and I think I'll be it so let's get on
to the haul actually just wanted to
mention at this makeup bag how cute it's
got my initials on are Al and it is from
this brand Instagram called lrm under
school kids and they basically do like
personalized leather gifts so it doesn't
necessarily have to be a makeup bag it
could be like a I think it's like
sunglasses cases or like a little wallet
or a keyring or something and I'm just
in love with this color for like summer
and spring so I'll leave that Instagram
down below if you're interested if
you're struggling to think of someone
like a gift for someone I think this is
so so cute and it's perfect for like
travel-size you can see it's kind of
like besides my hand so I can fit all my
like makeup bits in there which I'm
obsessed with I am home now so I
just go upstairs I have a Amazon
delivery because I ordered this
well I think if it's what I haven't
anything else around so I can't be
anything else this like face tanning
stuff from fake bake that's got like
coconut scented stuff in it so obviously
I was gonna buy it if it was coconut
infused but now I'm up here I thought
let me I'm such an idiot I've put
everything away but I'll show you the
main bits that I'm excited about that I
bought yesterday so these are the bits I
was most excited about so I got a couple
of what's that oh it's my makeup a
couple of bits from toothpaste something
from Urban Decay and something from
Palmer's so oh my god I've been dying to
get my hands in this palette I think
it's they're like most perfect like
summertime springtime palette there's
like really gorgeous pinky peach shades
obviously your neutrals and then there's
a pop of purple a pop of like olive
green I think this is such a gorgeous
palette for the summer and I can already
smell the palette from here I think I
showed this palette earlier in the vlog
but just as like a close-up I am
obsessed with these two puree and summer
young they're obviously warm cruise
colors and today I had this color
luscious on my lid which is like really
sorry for the finger that's Vegas a
really gorgeous champagne color then I
got this which is part of their melted
chocolate range which smells phenomenal
once again this is in the color chalk
honey and they literally I think this
was the last one let me swatch on my
hand it's a bit darker than I would
normally go oh my god once again I can
smell it already but focus focus
oh oh it's like that kind of plastic
darker nude color slightly more of a
brown undertone but I really like this
for the appearance of fuller lips I
think it's quite a natural color oh my
god
they smells so good and then from Urban
Decay I got their heavy metal glitter
liner in Midnight Cowboy I wanted this
for so long at my friend's use this all
the time and then I was watching luster
Lux or Katie and she had this all over
her lid and I was just like right that's
it I need it so it's kind of just like
paint on glitter rather than spraying
glitter on
um to your lid that's what I'm gonna use
it for obviously you can use it for
glitter winged liner so let me know if
you want to see a tutorial with that one
and last but not least I saw that
Palmer's came out with a coconut oil
body lotion coconut oil is like heaven
sent I swear to you it's like the best
for like stretch marks and just
smoothing out your skin and everything
so I got this for kind of like a body
moisturizer and it smells phenom so this
is what was in my Amazon package it is
the fake baked flawless coconut tanning
serum for face and body it's a serum so
I think it's meant to be a bit more
hydrating and this is the color medium I
tried to see if they did other colors
but I think it just comes in one let me
just try and open this I'm with the
packaging it's like so much more
different I love that it comes with
gloves they're like a must-have I need
to learn to use these because I always
end up having like a really dark hands
but no I'm really excited to try this I
always like experimenting with new face
tannaz I mainly got this to my face
because i religiously use my loving tan
on my body so I got this more for my
face so I'll let you know I get on with
that you might see me with a bit more of
a tanned face these days maybe that
means I'll get less comments telling me
and my foundation is the wrong color oh
okay so that comes to the end of this
vlog I'm sorry it's been so miss ma ma
Qi of things I'm sure at the beginning
of the vlog there are a lot of events
that you saw I went to a long time ago I
just never got around to putting it all
together so I thought I would finally
just do it today before I get onto a new
month and new things start coming in and
I can start blogging down before it gets
too too much footage so I really hope
