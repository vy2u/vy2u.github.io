the color difference okay funny everyone
and so I just thought I would show you I
just got such a cool package to effect
or to live it to my parents house but my
dad just brought it over only God
so first of all let me talk about these
new pigments from a peaches maker this
Phoenix one Oh Jen efficiency something
lights kind of bad it's like a deep
copper bronze I'm so living for it
literature their pigments are gorgeous
if you don't follow them their peaches
might be peaches makeup on Instagram I
think but their packaging is adorable
their pigments are incredible and so
that other makeup so definitely check
them out
oh my god so I just got this from Urban
Decay is the simple human mirror and
it's got light as well and oh my god
it's to go with their new of vise liquid
lipsticks and their like the special
effects ones so let me have a look cool
let me have an open and read and just
see a bit more about these so it says
please find clothes on new Urban Decay
by special effects topcoat alongside
this super luxe simplehuman mirror to
give you a hedge D view as you apply all
of my god so these are the shades that
we put like light ones and colorful ones
and the more kind of like cool Tony ones
and I think they're really cool they're
lip toppers so they're not like the
liquid lipsticks so it's to kind of like
transform your lip color these are what
they look like how pretty is this one
it's like a peachy like reflective nude
and I love the fact that they do all
these kind of different colors as little
is clear so it little those are normally
just kind of nude colors but this one's
like peach with like reflex like blue
through it as clear wand purple red cool
it's Monday if you can see it's 651 time
to the gym we can do this and then back
suddenly just realized I do anything i
enter the blog much yesterday but i
literally did nothing I just got back
from the gym with upper body today I
always had to do upper body a slash
means Union
okay win I always like to do upper body
first thing on a Monday just because
it's nowhere pilot in the sensor it's
the pain that I can give up on easiest I
don't mind my legs so much because I'm
like I want a big but you don't really
think about your arms but yeah so always
when she got on a Monday I'm is actually
about to pass out because I'm so hungry
it's too it's always too early it's my
pastor training centers at seventh and
we're too early to eat and then after I
workout I'm literally rather ravenous
that's the word I'm gonna make myself
some porridge with literally what I've
got to eat and then I've gotta do a food
shot and just some other chores and
stuff for me take you long future would
be able to get fuel as well which is
annoying I probably should have got
there on the way back but I'm just
hungry this is literally all I have as
my gym post post gym fuel not my choice

to take this back to bed with our with
the Real Housewives of Atlanta for an
hour and then I'm going to have a shower

to go to town to get some drugstore bits
for a full face of facts of drugstore
first impressions I sell it just a few
bits I'm missing if you could interested

like two salmon Phillips and why I like
to do is drizzle it with some sweet
chili sauce like that it's going to add
a bit of salt and pepper I'm at it so
let's fold it over here you go back fold
up into a little parcel that will cook
to like fill it and then I'll be able to
have another one either dinner probably
knocked in a bit like lunch tomorrow
