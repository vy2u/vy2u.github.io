September and I'm going to New York

literally about an hour's time I'm all
packed and ready to go they allowed us
to 23 kilograms suitcases and I feel
like that's so generous I still feel
like I've over packed but I had no idea
what to expect I'm so so excited and
just sat at my desk real quick just
doing some last-minute bits uploading
some videos to my hard drive so I can
edit them on the plane so I've got
videos to go up while I'm away yeah I'm
so excited I'm meeting Amy at the
airport and I will probably that'll
probably be the next time I film I am
obsessed with this glitter that's on my
eyes it is the Stila magnificent metals

this is the beginning of my New York
vlog it's going to be a week it's worth
of footage in one vlog so I hope you
guys enjoy my travels and hopefully
there's more to come just drive to the
airport
ami to get ahead so we can
our bags he had commute relieved if I
have such an example now that the
luggage and it's also big let me show
you honest-to-god half of that is filled
with shoes I spy a New York car took so
long now we're all checked in security
and now it's time to eat mix I'm about
to pass out and the duty-free can
commence me and Amy just got some lunch
if you know me you know I love creamy
mushroom and chicken - I got like
potatoes chicken and mushrooms and even
though it's one o'clock Amy got her
breakfast
I am at so hungry LM so ready to devour
this I'm literally searching out places
to go in New York right now am I like
planning one of our days I'm so excited
you're the bullet in the gun you shoot
me down I have no idea why filmed up
until now because I know I got caught at
the airport I was allowed to film and
I'm just assuming that the taxiing of
rising i've just got to my room excuses
their face
good morning everyone is the next day I
actually don't feel under the lights I
don't actually feel too jet-lagged I
tried to stay awake as long as possible
so I went to bed at a time in the UK and
normally but I think I went to bed at
11:30 even though my body was telling me
it was like I live in her like 6:00 in
the morning and I woke up and it is now
7:30 and me and Amy are about to go down
for breakfast today we have a Maybelline
at press conference and then I think I
show I'm not sure we don't have a
Maybelline press conference and a
Maybelline rooftop party just evening so
I can't wait to take you guys along with
me and show you yeah now like I said
we're going to go it down for some
breakfast and if it's worth showing you
I will show you blocking sure it will be
breakfast Asst I am so hungry I thought
it's about to go in like two seconds
another name between this part in the
lobby go and maybe maybe someone was
about to say like the maybe like pop
about finding we're not going to maybe
in conference and basically watch an
interview or the maybelline kind of what
a good like dragon masters so age on a
lemur that I've done people like that so
which can like sit and listen I'm really
excited we're just but it's like smiling
recorder like yeah I will try and put as
much I can not eat each other with the
aids Filner guy okay
Emily I think something that might be a
surprise people in this room is actually
a health and fitness and you were just
certified yoga also about how high touch
is an attitude that's what it is
maybe
maybe
before man
and maybe
I'm currently trying to be super healthy
and it's like a kale salads and salmon
but my watermelon lemonade there and I
got a smoothie coming in a bit so yeah
beach party
I'm gonna pee
it seems like my head
so we are all ready to go for the
Maybelline party I'm wearing all black
so I decided to go for a red lip and
obsessed with my hair and everything and
it's kind of like a bit the different
look for me a public fled trials when
I'll try and show you although I don't
have a full-length mirror sort of thing
I can show that we picked there would
have been pitched some Instagram yeah
I'll be literally just about to go
through dinner and I won't occur
all Matt I look because I knew I was
gonna go bred and I got my house of
lashes I colleagues on and yeah I'm so
so so excited and I'm going to try and
film as much like at the party yep
though let's go
I am finally back at the hotel
I can't remember how much I feel I'm
going to try and film quite a bit but it
was just so overwhelming and it was so
humid I looked like refused to get like
move half the time so it was quite a
struggle to keep getting my camera up I
think my films like a bit that was like
the most incredible party I've ever been
to in my life
I would turn one way and see Adriana
Lima and tan the other way and seen
Jourdan Dunn and you know you're just
like we're in the same airspace this is
literally crazy but we got a little
goodie bag so I thought I would show you
what's inside as always I feel like I
looked like share these things with you
because I would do this if I was with my
friends right now and I get really
excited so I haven't even seen what's in
it yet so let's bullet oh my god this is
cool so this is the first thing that's
in here this is something look you it's
a texting grip a phone grip a media
stand video chat it's literally like a
stand for your phone well look that's so
handy and then we've got this goodie bag
like a holographic goodie bag let's look
what's inside here oh my god so this is
a super similar to the goodie bag that I
got when I got here so I may have to do
a giveaway so you got another one of
those mascaras basically guys I also
actually got 'told which is really
upside this mascara and this baby lips
I'm not going to be available in the UK
like ever so maybe I'll do a giveaway
with these and another striping stick
maybe I'll do a giveaway with these
because like I said I got good knees and
you go from the UK I definitely want to
give someone a chance to use these and
then we've got three more little gosh
three more of their lipsticks we've got
like a nude of red and dark another one
of the brow precise um gels a got a
really smoky eyes palette and a liner so
yeah so I'm going to finally take my
makeup off now and go to sleep
tomorrow we are backstage at Jason whoo
I am so excited for that and then we
have their down time in the morning I
think we might be going for brunch and
so yeah then we've got backstage at
dagger the minute I have backstage at
Jason whoo
and then we are going to a Nicole Miller
show in the afternoon that is going to
be a super super exciting day I'm really
sorry if the footage is really like
choppy but I'm filming as much as I can
it's just quite hard sometimes when
you're carrying like ditty bags around
to fit like your camera in and then to
remember to get it out and stuff but I'm
trying to document this as much like air
because I want to remember this as much
as you guys do and yeah so I'm gonna hit
the sack now but I don't know if I've
said it in the vlog yeah I would have
said it on Instagram if you want to know
what lip this is this is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick and it's
Sarah fine I think it's called
and these lashes are House of lashes I
connects but I did post about on
Instagram so hopefully you would have
seen it then yeah I'm on to the next day
I suppose hello is the next day we only
had breakfast at the hotel again we
didn't go out for brunch I didn't bother
filming that otherwise I thought it
would just get a little bit repetitive
but as you guys probably already knows I
probably just said we're off off stage
what we are off to go backstage for
Jason Wu this morning and then we are
going to a nekoma to show this afternoon
but Jason we should be really really
exciting what only backstage we're not
actually watching the show but I think
backstage will be a little bit more
exciting get to be a bit up close with
the models to our film as much I can
I've never been actually I haven't
London but I've not been like a
backstage at a major major fashion show
for I know you can't post social media
while you're actually there so well
before the show goes live anyways so
gonna be really really careful what
we're doing but yeah I'm really really
excited
speed
Oh
I can barely catch my
part of my arms - marks on my jacket
like resting on my shoulders
busy and we're just looking at the
makeup they're going for like
pretty straight in a tab right there so
you can like the making strobing stick
and that did it math
basically find a right sort of that cool
girl smokey eye where you know that girl
that moves
it's all just with eyeliner my partner
in crime in between
so we're back at the hotel room now we
had a really really gorgeous gorgeous I
guess it was kind of gorgeous I had a
really really good dinner at this place
I can't remember what it was called but
they didn't have film in there or take
picture so I wasn't able to like
document anything and I think it's
because it's actually it was actually
quite a popular place for celebrities to
eat their dinner because it was really
dark kind of underground we didn't see
anyone there famous but yes they didn't
let us film or take any pictures but I
just go back to the room now and
tomorrow we have like a full morning off
and we're not working or going to any
shows or anything there oh all in the
afternoon so we're going to go for a
really really nice breakfast I can't
wait to see that I'm not gonna say what
it is yet but um yeah we're going to go
through nice breakfast recommended by me
because last time we were there well
last time I went to New York we went
there so yeah we're going there tomorrow
and it's only 8:30 right now so I am
absolutely shattered like I'm ready to
hit the sack so I can't wait to show you
tomorrow we've got a really exciting
fashion show and we're it's quite like
it's oh my god I don't mean to just zoom
in there than I don't I hope that still
recorded but um yeah I've got quite like
an edgy show tomorrow so I can't wait to
show you my look and what I decide to do
for that but yeah today was literally
the best day ever so so many like famous
people and just like all the experiences
were just amazing so and so I'm in a
really like a grateful mood but yeah I'm
gonna go to bed now and then excited but
so gjd breakfast will ever see in your
life
oh god this is like an actual work about
god bless
and then I'll show you
turning different
the Nicole Miller I went to yesterday
it's really dark in here
I got have done the show
you're the package
sweetie back at look I'm back in my room
now I just got changed out of my outfit
and I've been really liking dark eyes I
never used to like dark eyes I was such
a like bronzy coppery type person that
I'm really digging this in the moment
and this was my makeup from today I used
the the the bomb map me palette and
literally just like dark shades from
there it's literally just my Rihanna
um VMAs inspired makeup look I look she
just did that but yet tomorrow we
literally have the whole day of shopping
like we have no shows nothing we've only
got a Maybelline party in the evening so
we're gonna do some damage tomorrow I
think and we just had a really nice
dinner it was such a closed restaurant
in and like you ordered loads of a
little nibbles and they came like
staggered throughout the evening and jet
lag is really getting to me but yeah so
tomorrow I'm so excited to shop till I
pop and I think I must be like the worst
dog ever I always forget to get my
camera and tomorrow's actually 9/11 here
in New York so be a really emotional day
here for some people so yeah I'm just
gonna go to sleep now
I'll see you tomorrow bye

so after a long day of shopping I kind
of filmed a little bit so it wasn't that
interesting I am now ready for the
Maybelline a party rooftop penthouse
