pillows then over here we've got some
amazing amazing at Tarte products as you

shape tape I'm so excited for this I
really really wanted to try it but I
didn't think I'd be able to get my hands
on it
so this is so exciting we've got some
lashes and some lip products as well
we've got a chauffeur let's go into the
bathroom got some brilliant nicest top
skincare we've got the maracuja oil they
have rainforest of the sea stuff we've
got some wipes let's see what's in here
we've just got some minis so we've got
some like moisturizer a little lip balm
a mini version of the SFX and something
stick I'm not sure what it is but it's
all the puff that skin care and then
like a little American oil I'm here as
well would some like familiar faces that
you might know I'm here with Amy's
makeup box Cece carp J piers and the
beador twins and I think Sonia and
Pfizer not 100% sure what we're doing
this whole time that were here but we
have dinner later at 7:00 so I'll be
taking you with me for that just about
to start doing my makeup and now I have
so many new goodies to play with like
Russia and Homer
her primer powder these pallets are to
bomb at a bomb had to die for I already
had these two but I've been dying to try
it the her Uche one so I can't wait to
show you what I create so this is the
kind of makeup look I've gone for I've
gone for obviously a smokey eye and I
knew they're just like eating dinner
engine run do anything to your briber I
definitely will be doing brighter colors
having blunderhead don't inspired me to
do more brighter lips literally on my
eyes I used like I think I'm already
would have posted something on Instagram
right now but I use like these three
colors in my crease from the in the
bloom palette I have a funny girl on the
lid I've got this second inner corner
highlight and my blusher actually I
dipped in kind of like a bit of both
between those blushes and yeah on my lip
is the Tarte is lip paint in namaste and
I used the tightest eyeliner and I'm
obsessed with this at the moment so I
totally changed my lip option I've gone
for the tan tears lip pain and juicy
because I put my outfit on and it's
already black and white and I thought it
was a bit boring but now we're gonna
head down for dinner
and you see who else is here I'm not
sure if there is anyone else besides the
view but I said earlier but we shall see
it so I will show you everyone I was in
a minute
so you're back well I am back in my room
now such a gorgeous dinner and it was so
nice just to be able to sit down and get
to know the girls I was on a table with
Laura and Claudia Medora and Jade and
obviously from tart and it was just so
nice to get to know them they are so so
so lovely and I can't wait to get to
know the others a bit more and I think

start being able to vlog the proper
stuff that we're up to this week so yeah
so yeah I'm gonna go to bed now and I'll
see you in the morning
let's chase those cigars the moon we'd
go to bed to say oh yeah well this kind
of like giant mall which is basically
the biggest like I don't know designer
shopping thing I've ever seen in my
early life like you would have just seen
the kind of pan I just did have all the
sides to the shops and it's actually
crazy so we're all kind of feeling
feeling spending so I'll take branch off
with me and I'll show you what I get
we said this might be very said by the
Siletz join in your view but Lavinia
Steve one device okay it won't focus but
disobey you

standing at the moon we'd go to bed in
my arms you're safe and sound without
wait to see what happens if we say

a little bit yeah
good morning guys so I hope you guys are
all well I had such a nice sleep last
night it was so nice to have a line cuz
we didn't have any plans for this
morning but today I actually can't
remember how much I filmed yesterday but
today we've got a bit of a down day and
it me and Amy are about to go to the spa
and I'm not really short we're doing I
think it could be like a mess but surely
something but I've never really had like
any of that before so this is so so so
exciting and I'm really scared quite
tight still I don't wanna look foolishly
I shall look like room service to my
room and it was absolutely delicious
they bring it in on a little table but I
had some like scrambled eggs and I asked
for scrambled eggs and I think it was
like sausages or something and it I
thought it was gonna be like scrambled
eggs on the side and then sausages on
the side like whatever but it was all
like integrated into it and it was so
good and I had a latte as well and as
honestly the nicest latte I've ever had
this morning I was just chilling and
going through emails and looking at all
the comments on my video and stuff like
that see how we're having a super
chilled down dead state which I'm kind
of excited about and then dinner later
it's our last dinner so I'm sure
everyone's gonna be super BAM and I can
we and I'll show you kind of what we get
up to today if it's like any interesting
it's kind of different vlog my New York
one New York one was definitely more
turned out and we had a lot of things to
cover it was definitely more work II
this is definitely work but it is more
kind of relaxed in the downtime so I'm
not even sure what I'm filming but it's
kind of just more like bits of things
that I'm doing throughout the week so I
hope you guys don't mind but yeah I'll
show you what we got you the rest of the
day

the Florence and having some of the most
amazing ice cream I've ever had in my
life in-out gonna get ready for dinner
I'm just about to do my makeup and I
just thought I would show you my outfit
before I go just in case I don't get a
chance to show you later and then yeah

play suit from misguided these mesh
boots from soulish they've got my little

what's in there is like in the UK
so I am now just about to go to bed I've
just been spending like my whole evening
packing it's like 10:00 to 2:00 and I
think I'm gonna be way way over the
limit we've got so much stuff while we
were here and I'm so grateful for it but
I should have thought about this before
I came because I was already over the
weight limit before I came and Britta
sickly I feel like it's just gonna be
way too much and probably have to buy a
suitcase they're poor but I've had the
most phenomenal trip I might a little
bit tomorrow I'm not sure just because
it would just be me travelling back Bob

gonna last breakfast together and stuff
honestly this has been literally the
trip the lifetime I can't wait to show
you all the new products and get you
guys excited for them it's so incredible

a million years thought I would ever be
doing anything like this so I have you
