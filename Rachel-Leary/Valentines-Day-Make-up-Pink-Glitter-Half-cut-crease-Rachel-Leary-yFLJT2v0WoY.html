the moon
we'd go to bed in my arms to say some
sound without us read and wait hey guys
welcome back to my channel so today I am
doing a Valentine's Day night I know
personally for me not gonna be having
any a mega plans on Valentine's Day can
go pretty long so I thought I would take
this opportunity to create a look that I
would do which is basically a refill
goodlet super glam all my favorite
products type saying sticking obviously
with the pink theme that obviously comes
with Valentine's Day I kind of did it
cool glitter liner look so I really hope
you guys enjoying obviously depending on
what you're doing you might need to
switch out some of the products or
whatever but I really really love the
way that this came out I love if a new
technique to me as well for something
really really fun to define that glam
look that I thought was appropriate
Valentine's Day because it's pink
sparkly and it makes me feel good so
yeah if you like the look of this makeup
this make sure to give it a thumbs up
and make sure to subscribe you haven't
already definitely gonna be doing a few
more Valentine's Day looks I definitely
want to do a drugstore one and maybe
something involving a red lip because
you guys know that's my fave yeah I
really have you guys love this video and
please keep watching
we're going to start with our eyes first
and to primer eyes today I'm going to
use the NSW 20 promo I can see that from
Mac is the sign this all over my lid and
a tiny bit underneath as well and then I
am going to go ahead and set that in
case with any sort of herbs that you
might have because it makes it so so so
much easier when at blending eyeshadows
because this is a concealer and it's
really premium quite wet you don't want
anything too like to transfer either now
if I should I'm going to take the
hottest Pro Amazonian clay eyeshadow
palette this is such a gorgeous palette
and I'm taking the shade innocent which
is a really nice with soft warm Brown
really close to max soft brown as well
and I'm just buffing that into the
crease
and then taking it this shade here which
is a slightly warmer brown on a Mac of
two one seven and just blending that in
it to the crease as well just to further
deepen it up and add a bit of warmth to
the look and then going back in with the
two to four as I always do and it just
blending all out to make sure there is
no harsh lines then I'm taking this
gorgeous pink color to tie in with the
Valentine's Day pink beam on a slightly
smaller to fine a fluffy brush and
taking this quite a way across the lid
just because I want this color to be
quite visible in the transition like
throughout all the eyeshadows and then
to further deepen I'm sticking with the
kind of pinky purpley lovey-dovey seem
and taking this purple shade and just
placing it on the outermost part of my
eye and then again buffing it all in
place and then going to take my
tentative u28 Pro Longwear concealer
from mac and I'm going to use this to
kind of carve out my crease and create
that harpes cut crease look I'm just
using a really small concealer brush to
do this making sure I always look down
so it doesn't transfer and then I'm
going to set it all in place with this
cream eyeshadow from the same palette
because I just wanted to keep the lid
really plain and Matt you just add a
sparkle if you was to but then I'm going
back into that fluffy brush that we used
to apply the pink shade and picking up a
tiny bit more of that pink shade and
kind of using side-to-side soughing
motions to blend the kind of half cut
crease into the rest of these shadows
then I'm going to clean up everything
underneath just using a white person are
going to be doing a wing and you guys
know I love doing this that makes it so
much easier and before we do that I'm
just going to highlight my inner corner
using the matte white eyeshadow from the
same palette now for winged eyeliner
take the Maybelline precise viola just
to do my normal cat eye and then I'm
going to take it makes a glam liner in
it glam pink I'm basically going to
trace over the top of the
liner that we just did and then kind of
combine two techniques together so doing
that one and then drawing in my cruiser
kind of creating a cure to cut crease
look but making sure to connect me
together and then just make them a tiny
bit thicker where they connect for that
kind of emphasis on the look and then
just going back in with my black liner
and a wipe just doing all the necessary
little steps I kind of want to take just
to make sure it's all perfectly in place
so I'm just going to apply mascara and
lashes at people of the lower lashes and
you complete me which I do have a
discount code on which I always leave it
down below and this is what the finished
kind of top half of the eyes and brows
look like now on the to the skin I'm
just going to take my strobe cream from
Mac this is literally my favorite like
sting to apply to my skin before
foundation and this one has a slightly
to each year under time and then I've
been really loving it be a Smashbox I
think that the photo silica primer and I
just like to apply that more to the
center of my face just where I find a
makeup doesn't last as long and use it
downwards emotions when I buff it in
with a brush and then for oh I actually
oh yeah I love doing this technique this
is the Mac Pro Longwear concealer that I
was using earlier and I just like to
apply that first just because I really
like the appearance of a brighter under
eye at the moment I feel like it always
looks bright when I applied directly
straight to my skin so if the time is
underneath and just buffing it in with a
Beauty Blender I do like to take a small
concealer brush to tidy up the winged
liner beforehand and then full
foundation I am its you can be a cover
effects facial creams foundation I think
it is called and it matches the color of
my neck of my turns resolved okay
everyone chill out and then it just
button that in space key all the areas
that I didn't apply the concealer and
then just going over with my huge gonna
finish with all of lenses together then
you want to go ahead and set everything
with your powder and once I've done that
I'm just going to go back to the eyes
and take that pink shade just on a small
angled brush and then on both sides and
then just taking that innocent eyeshadow
that we use initially in it the crease
through above and blend that out to kind
of create that really mostly look vibes
and really loving having a slightly
darker eyeshadow at the water plant I
think it really makes my eyes
pop then I'm just going to go ahead and
apply portent lash mascara and then I
decided to add a white into the roof
line and it's this one is a chic white
noise eyeliner and then leave the finish
eyes back to the face I'm taking a max
dark golden bronzer this is literally my
favorite bond because I don't feel it's
too orange and it's a really nice
quality color and four-flusher I'm
officiating my favorite Russia from NATO
sweet this is in the color romance and
to define that to apples of my cheek and
for highlighter I'm at taking it
Geoffrey start Kings
cockeyed initiative and I'm at 54 and
just blending that on to the tops of my
cheekbones and then I'll be honest the
tip of my nose and my Cupid's bow and I
sometimes just like to just the excess
amounts of products on their brushes
like above my brows and stuff now onto
the lips I'm taking this Natasha Jimena
lip liner in the color l6 I think it is
and just using this alot slightly over
line my lips and create a slightly
fuller lip and I'll see it blend it in
as well this is one of my favorite news
combinations at the moment this is
anastasia beverly hills stripped and i
really really loved this one with the
lip pencil as well so i'm just applying
this all over the lips it's a slightly
peachy color tone up your Hollywood it
you haven't tried it already and for lip
gloss I'm exceeding it this one from the
petrous makeup this is in the color
honey and these taste and smell amazing
in actually it smell like peaches oh I'm
literally obsessed but this is the
finished makeup look I really hope you
