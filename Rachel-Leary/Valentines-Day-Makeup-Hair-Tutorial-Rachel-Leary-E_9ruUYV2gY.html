filmed this kind of Valentine's Day
inside hair and makeup look it's using
kind of all my favorite products that I
like to use but I want to make myself
feel good point about Wednesday making
yourself look nicer this might not be
for everyone it's quite a lot of makeup
and people might prefer some a bit more
natural if you do that's obviously
totally up to you this is just the kind
of look that I like to wear so yeah if
you like the look of this hair and
makeup then please keep watching
starting off with my eyebrows already
done all the products are always listed
in the down bar below then I'm gonna be
using tape because nobody has time to be
making any mistakes if you're game ready
for Valentine's Day so I'm gonna be
prepping my eyes with the soft ochre
Paint Pot in Oh yep the soft ochre Paint
Pot for Mac and then going in it using
this away the cocoa blend palette and
taking this warm brown shade on a fluffy
brush and just buffing that into the
socket using kind of windscreen wiper
motions you guys know the drill
then are taking the line behind Venus
palette and this really gorgeous pinky
purple shade if you guys aren't a
supporter of Lime Crime bitten from
makeup puke is a really good joob I just
I'm using this because I have the color
and the palette so I thought why not and
I'm again using a fluffy brush to just
build up the color intensity and then
going back in with the brush that we
used originally with the warm crease
color to just kind of soften it out and
just like I said build up to a
consistency and pigmentation that I was
happy with then taking this pigment from
Engler in the number 22 it's basically
like a rose golden purple shade and then
applying the mixing medium that eyeliner
one from Mac as my base this is like the
best base I find for pigments that are a
bit loose or like now renowned for
having kind of fall out so I'm just
pressing the pigment onto the lid and
kind of smudging it on as well to get
the most out the color and the
pigmentation and you can see in the
clips just how gorgeous this color is
and I thought it would be a nice kind of
different to like a rose gold it's kind
of like I said it had a bit more like a
purple tinge to it so I thought that
would go really nicely with these colors
and something a little bit different
taking this matte brown shade from the
same palette I'm just using that to
further deepen up the socket I didn't
want to go in with black or anything too
harsh I did when I still keep it soft
and then just going back in with our
original fluffy brush to like I said
really soften out their edges standard
taking an angled brush and the same dark
brown color just kind of packing the
shadow on a lot heavier I'm using this
as my eyeliner and this is why using
tape is really handy too it makes it so
so so much easier here's winged eyeliner
is like the bane of everyone's life and
if you want to get ready knowing that
you like ruined your eyeliner is just
gonna put you in the worst mood so I
thought I would do something with
eyeshadow instead to kind of create the
same effect
then taking it the kind of vanilla shade
from this away the palette just using
that to highlight my inner corner and my
brow bone
then I'm just applying mascara and
lashes these are the peaches makeup
lashes in this style number zero a I'm
literally in love with and they add
drama but to me it's not too much but
obviously they are optional going on to
skin I'm prepping my skin with the
Smashbox hydrating primer and using the
NARS all day luminous foundation I know
the transition made me look super yellow
but you'll see when I'm using this
concealer which is the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer in the shade like warm I
kind of lighten up my skin and balance
everything out to set everything in
place I'm using my Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder and a big
fluffy brush and just prattle the places
that I know I tend to get the most kind
of shine just to make sure that my
makeup lasts the longest throughout the
night going back in with the original
crease color I am just buffing that
lightly under my eyes to kind of
complete the eyelid and then applying a
bottom lash mascara so this is the
finish I like I hope you guys like it
obviously like I said lashes are
optional it's all optional II prefer
something a little less dramatic just do
whatever you feel comfortable with
continuing on with the face I am at
bronzing my skin using the Too Faced
chocolate bronzer on a fluffy brush and
just applying that from the temples of
my forehead and just on my cheeks then I
am using this blusher from in the shade
unlawful which is like a really soft
pink and I had a tiny bit of sparkle to
it so I thought that would really
complement that I look so just obviously
applying that beside the apples of my
cheeks and taking it just up onto my
temples as well for highlight I'm taking
the Kiko eyeshadow in the shade
200a obviously you know the whisper of
gill laura geller gilded honey they're
all dupes for this one as well if you
can't get hold of it then for the lips
I'm using this pencil from Oprah in the
shade nude even though it's definitely a
lot more of a pinky tone just to outline
my lips slightly and then to fill them
in I am taking this liquid lipstick from
Anastasia Beverly Hills in the shade
love
and applying the rags-to-riches dazzle
glass from mac on the top
so this is the finished makeup look kind
of sticking with the pinkier themes for
Valentine's Day so I hope you guys liked
it moving on it to the hair I am at
taking my nume five-in-one tights and
curling one and in the largest bowel to
create really soft waves then it's
taking my kind of front two shortest
layers and then using a comb to take the
rest of my hair back I'm leaving those
two bits at the front as kind of like a
fringe and then as you can see like I
said taking the rest of my hair back and
only kind of like half of my hair if
that makes sense to kind of do a half up
half down look leaving kind of curly
bangs at the front it's kind of gonna be
self-explanatory in the video but I'm
just kind of combing it all back then
back combing it to give a bit of volume
and then just tying it with a ponytail
to set it all in place I'm just taking
my trusty Loreal Elnett hairspray and
yeah just rubbing about so I was happy
with it but that is the finished hair
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial give it a thumbs up if you did
but until next time I will see you soon
bye guys like the most of factory's
thing ever I reckon this is going to
make amazing eye shadow as well as like
a really really pigmented hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
