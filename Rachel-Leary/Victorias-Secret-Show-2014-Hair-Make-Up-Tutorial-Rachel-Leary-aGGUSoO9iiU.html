Secret Fashion Show inspired hair and
makeup tutorial the models skin always
looks super radiant and natural so to
prep my skin I'm mixing my Mac Studio
moisture cream with my Scott Farms body
bling which is gonna hydrate and also
add a bit of color and glow to my skin
the foundation I wanted something that
was gonna last a long time and look
really natural so I'm using my Mac face
and body foundation with my morphe g5
brush which they kindly sent to me so go
check them out their products are
amazing quality and that's so affordable
and I use the shade c3 and Mac face and
body for anyone who was interested
for eyebrows I'm using my anastasia
dipbrow in taupe to fill in the outer
third of my brows the flat definer brush
from Dallas Dalian tools or bdellium
tools not really sure and then use my
Kiko brow pencil to fill in the inner
third to create a natural a gradient
effect so I'm just doing in the way that
I always do I think at some point I'm
gonna do a brow tutorial so I don't have
to keep sort of going into them in each
video because everyone does their brows
differently
I then sculpt out my brows with my mac
studio finish concealer in the shade NC
15 using a small brush from morphe
gunmetal range and then just buffing
that out with a real techniques brush to
prep my lids I'm using my soft ochre
Paint Pot for mac all over and around my
eye as always and then to set it I'm
using my studio fix powder I'm just
setting your kind of cream creamy primer
it's just gonna ask the longevity of all
your eyeshadows and just make sure that
they go on a lot smoother and don't get
sort of stuck in any of the wetness of
the cream product for eye shadows i'm
using all morphe shadows considering
their palettes have just about every
color and a perfect for this look and
i'm using their Mac palette and their
shimmery palette and I'm using the sand
color as my initial transition shade
it's a lot like Mac uninterrupted so if
you're looking for a dupe for that this
is perfect and buffing it into the
crease with my Sigma e-40
it's taking this warm brown shade I'm
using a Mac two one seven to further
deepen the crease I watched a video
about the models makeup and the makeup
artist said that they used all Browns
gold and Gray's on the Angels so that's
what I'm gonna use
so all over the lid I'm mixing these two
shimmery gold shades and just placing
them all over my lid where I haven't
actually put any shadow yeah
it looks Brown but it is gray so I'm
using this matte gray shade and I'm
buffing it into the divide between the
shimmer shades and the matte Browns we
put there earlier to create a seamless
transition in the crease and kind of
deepen it further to make sure there are
no lines and I'm just going back in my
to 1:7 to buff out all of the shadows as
well
I then take this paler shimmery gold
shade into my inner corner and take it
up a bit onto my lid as well and then
place the white shimmer shade on top to
create a really bright inner corner
highlight and also I'm gonna take that
onto my brow bone to highlight there as
well and then I'll just buff that out
with my Sigma e-40 brush again
sorry this bit is out of focus but I'm
using my black morphe gel liner and I'm
just using a thin liner brush to create
a really slim line as close to the lash
line as possible then thickening it just
a tiny bit the further out I go and then
I'm gonna create the base line for the
wing drag out a tiny bit because they
didn't have a huge wing but there was
definitely one there so I'm going gonna
just create the base line for the wing
and drag it back in connecting it to the
original line
using a small shader brush and that
matte gray shadow again I'm smoking out
the liner to create a sultry kind of
look and then bring it up into my outer
crease to define it and create a cat eye
effect and then buff it out I don't know
why the lighting is so different than
this one but it soon fades back to being
the same as before I was trying out this
different lighting so let me know if you
prefer this one or my other one because
I'm still new to it so I'm just playing
around
and just apply any mascara you can leave
it that but later I am gonna be applying
some accent lashes lashes lashes to
enhance the cat eye look now to my face
I'm using my Mac mineralize concealer in
MC 20 to highlight under my eyes
forehead the usual places as you'll see
in a second and then to buff it out I'm
using a new favorite brush from morphe
that's a tapered kabuki kind of similar
to the is that the Sigma f80 6 that's
the one that's ringing a bell but I
think it's called that and yeah I'm just
using this to blend out all the places
that I highlighted
as I want to keep it looking as natural
as I can I'm using a cream bronzer from
Bourjois that smells like heaven to come
to my cheekbones forehead and jawline
it looks really full-on to start with
but because it's a cream it's gonna be
blending in really seamlessly and
naturally into my foundation
to set my concealer and get rid of some
of the shine on my face I'm using my
Studio Fix powder again in NC 20 and
just pressing it into my skin
to further bronze I'm using my zoeva
mineral bronzer to warm up my whole face
considering the models all like to see
bronze and I a hundred percent
pink cheeks was an obvious feature on
every models face so I'm using my Mac
mineralized blush and dainty to achieve
this and just going in with a really
light hand because I personally am NOT a
fan of blusher so I do want it to be too
heavy
the highlight I'm using this incredible
highlighter from Bobby Brown
their holiday collection I think this
one is from and applying it to place it
the light would naturally hit and you
could see I was very impressed with how
it was coming across on camera because
it truly is one of the best highlighters
I own I so get it while you can back to
my eyes I'm using the war matte matte
brown shade we were using earlier in the
crease and taking it under my eye using
a fluffy pencil brush
the lashes I'm using these ones from
earlier and I didn't really like them on
their own so I cut them in half and use
the fuller side to create a cat's eye
effect for my eyes on my lips I'm using
my new favorite lip liner from Mac
called sublime culture which is really
creamy and super easy to apply and then
to add a bit of pink I'm gonna be using
my NYX butter gloss in a Claire and then
lightening the center of my lips and
with my studio finish concealer for Mac
but this is the finished makeup look
which was super easy and wearable for
everyday but now moving on to hair this
was my hair after leaving it to just air
dry after I washed it so before I curl
it I had to lightly straighten it to
avoid my curls frizzing and then I put
my hair in sections and there's gonna be
three in total
so using my Coryell OSes curling wand
I'm gonna be alternating the way I curl
each section so for this one I'm curling
it in an outwards motion so just taking
a reasonable amount of hair and then
just wrapping it around the wand away
from my face
I hold each bit of hair for about 15
seconds but as you can see in this one
I'm then what I'm now calling it in an
inward direction and I'm just gonna be
repeating this throughout my whole head
hair whatever this motion of like
alternates in the direction of each curl
is just gonna add more volume and make
the curls look a lot more beachy and
natural so I'm just continuing to do
this for this layer and then for all the
other layers as well so this is what one
half of my hair looks like now the other
half of my hair and then as you'll soon
see
that's the middle layer done and my
whole head
it's the finished result and then I just
run my fingers through it to brush out
the curls a bit and make them a little
look a bit more natural and I was
looking at this photo of Candice and she
had her hair and it's really
sophisticated side parting so I'm just
putting my fringe over and fluffing my
hair up at the roots and then that's it
so this is my finished Victoria's Secret
makeup and hair tutorial thank you so
