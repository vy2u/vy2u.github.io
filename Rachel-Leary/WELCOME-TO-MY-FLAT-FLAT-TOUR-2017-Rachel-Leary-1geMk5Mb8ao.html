Oh
in truth this is the front door as soon
as you come in distracted by this table
here which if either one use as my shoe
racket actually a table stands mark here
and pretty sure is so are so so cheap
every sandwich oh by the way I have
linked it down below then for something
is super boring you open this and you're
faced with the fun job that is when you
do your washing and all that kind of
stuff I kind of put my extra duvet how
like best deck chairs in there and
that's all the stuff I have to use to
you know read my meters and all that
crash done so this is a telephone how I
answer my front door they'll bring it
down below and then I will pick it up
and then straight ahead of you here is
my bedroom so I've kind I've put the
blinds down for privacy reasons for one
but then also so I can show you my bed
my bed is literally my favorite thing
ever is so so so comfortable again I've
linked it down below you can custom any
kind of color of the lights they do come
built-in and it is diamonds or in my
encrusted embroided in there so that the
fan is on but I guess for all these
cushions here I the gray ones are from
Ikea and they lit you like the cheapest
pillowcases ever
I can't link the big fluffy one because
it is from TK Maxx and everything from
TJ Maxx is like one of a kind and that
online shop is shite but these pink con
Pierre from Debenhams and I've linked
them down below for my bedside tables I
just used to Alex nine drawers I did
originally use them as my makeup storage
but I kind of got better makeup storage
and these what I use like literally I
still like my pants in there like little
bits and bobs
loads of random bits and like on the top
I will see it keep my fan I charge my
phone I keep all my perfumes and stuff
over the back there and the fun bit got
my little wash box here and then up here
again it's the same kind of concept
though most of these are pretty much
empty because I couldn't think of
anything to put in them but I have like
all my jewelry up here a lot of touch of
skincare is because I didn't know where
to put it a like I want to remind myself
to use it but this is like the remote
control that comes
with the bed so I've kind of got it on
that solid earth like a flash mode at
the moment or something but you can just
pick solid colors and then it's like any
of these colors which is a really cool
then as you come through here with a
fluffy rug on the floor I'm not linked
in that because it just gathered so much
stuff I read it recommend it and I
definitely want a new one then here is
like the built-in that wardrobe space
that came with the flat I did it by
these bins like storage bins separately
again I've linked them down below but I
just kind of hang all that my everyday
it clothes in there and I need to have
the biggest care ever so then moving on
it through here this is my like on
sweets bathroom and I have way way way
too many parts again the storage of this
still needs to be worked on but it is a
really keep silent on so you have my
shower in the back there then as you
leave on my bedroom you come through
here leave a giant mirror here again it
from Ikea and then in here is my filming
rooms you can see it's super light and
bright I have again linked all this kind
of stuff down below but I am doing a
makeup collection that video next week
so stay tuned for that but this is what
kind of what I keep my makeup in now and
again I linked them at down below but I
am so happy with it I can literally see
everything I'll give you a little sneak
preview of things that like does
everything for my OCD I swear yeah this
is what kind of the top of it looks like
all the stuff on the top just needs to
find a home at the moment
then as you can see in the back there
I've got my NYX kind of campaign framed
with me and Amy and then here it just
kind of like an open storage unit from
Ikea but I kind of keep all my jacket
and then like my going-out clothes on
and I have a shoe rack here and do you
believe they are actually all the high
heels I own I had like the biggest clear
ever and then again I have two of the
same kind of collection on that these
are kind of sets of six drawers kind of
a modernized version of the alux drawers
and I prefer them there because it
reflects so so so much light to the room
just appears so much bigger and then I
store this makeup on the top again how
pleasing is that like everything just
laid out super like neatly I love it
that's why I keep on
of their and then here is like my little
filming setup I've got my two soft boxes
and a ring right and again I use the
natural light as well again I've listed
everything down below like even the
table and everything but I will be going
into more detail in my makeup collection
at videos but that is just kind of what
this room looks like then out here this
is kind of where I keep other pairs of
shoes I'm scared to like pull this yeah
I keep other pairs of shoes when
normally they were full but then when I
get them out of there I get really lazy
and then I just put them straight on
there so I do to kind of organize that
but I just use a little hard dish to put
my kid on neither has a Sun God but I
reach all over times Alec go with
everything so I always leave them out
and then I just like take them and pop
them in like my bag and here is just
like where I keep all my letters and
stuff an important bit these are nice
little messages when I moved and from my
best friend Lucy Indiana is another
bathroom but the reason I wait showing
in here is because yes this is still a
work in progress but this is like my
extra master bathroom this is like all
the makeup and stuff that like I need to
go through donate saw out for like
giveaway prize and then when I have my
makeup tear out I had all this excess
storage I just need to find a place to
put that but all of the mitt all of the
bathroom have a big mirror up there so
that's super handy but yet this room is
like a disaster but then through here we
have my lounge and my kitchen area so
I'll start with the kitchen this is
literally like my new favorite thing
ever this is like a week you can apply
pieces here to write down the schedule
for my week and it is from a company
called in the box gift I just put them
on my Instagram I've got a bunch of
stuff from them so when I go around I'll
tell you cuz they are the best thing at
it it's like personalized gifts like
occasion so like a newborn baby you've
just moved house birthdays are anything
and they personalize it gives for that
kind of stuff so when I leave house they
certainly want and this is so handy
but along here is just like my kitchen I
keep all my appliances and
my new table making up my smoothies in
the morning it came with like an oven
and all that kind of stuff so that just
kind of stayed there and that there is
my fridge I keep like my coats and stuff
hung up there and like my drying rail
and my ironing board and my Hoover goes
in there here I just kind of have like
my dining room and table and then this
was like my mum's idea it's a big
bookshelf but we kind of use it as like
a room divide the club it is only just
like one big room we kind of wanted to
feel like we were separating it into
dancing room so to separate the of the
kitchen and then the lounge we've got
this but again this is from Ikea I have
left it links down below I literally
love this I've had my 100,000 subscriber
blackened now I can put plants and
frames and all that kind of stuff these
little plants are actually from Nuala
and then this is actually from a
beautiful subscriber she gave this to me
at my models owner meet-and-greet Thank
You assistant so much I've had it on
display all the time and then these are
just some can of this is the one from in
the box gift which is home sweet home
which is so cute smells like vanilla and
it smells absolutely amazing again it
just some other candles up here here I
just like to keep like important books
and magazines and again some photo
frames my sister gave me this is my
birthday and it's all these like old
pictures above together which is so
funny and this is like the Polaroid of
when I met who does she made sure that
everyone got Polaroids together so she
was like this can be like a long-term
memory and even bought us the framed
equipment which is adorable again at
this are is I actually don't know where
it from I think it's on the store in
Brighton because my friend Lou to go
it's me and that hashtag came in a PR
package from Rimmel and it actually
lights up hold on let me turn on yeah it
actually lights up so it's definitely
wanted to keep that and not throw it
away so I keep that bad and then I used
to just have so much clutter down here
so I got all these black boxes that
again it from Ikea so so so cheap put
little labels on the middle it round or
the like stuff in there I thought it
made it look so much more organized and
then on the bottom there and loads of PR
boxes I thought I could reuse if I ever
donated or gifts did you guys any makeup
a couple put them in I just keep them
there just in case so here on the other
side is like my lounge area nothing both
is I don't think I plan to keep them
forever but loads of so when I first
moved in I just needed some sofas for
diesels are actually from eBay and they
came so quickly which is just why I need
them and they were the perfect size but
like I said these sofas are from eBay
this is kind of like the Big C to chair
and then that is like a two seater sofa
evil footstools are from a very and so
if this rug the kitchen's the red rump
of an Ikea and the ones behind again
they're from TK Maxx or I can't really
link them but this blanket is from Etsy
and it's from my sister she got it meets
my birthday and it you have staffer
Dixit switch me I just want to drink tea
it create stuff and sleep I feel like
Amy's makeup books you know Amy needs
that because all she does is drink tea
and create stuff and sleep so Amy if
you're watching and you need that
blanket so again this is why I love this
I can put photo frames up for everyone
to see so I just put pictures up with
all my friends then I have a little nuts
there a little table out there is my
balcony which I love it's so nice in the
summer to go outside of being a shutter
at salinity reasons and then here is my
kind of TV setup so the TV's like a
50-inch TV I think it's an LG and this
box and recall I can't light on so
that's like an LED light in there so
haven't decided what I want to put in
there but I literally thought that was
the perfect like cabinet my PV because
it's like rounded and cuz this room is I
believe you can tell it is a little bit
of like a curve so everything that I've
got kind of has like a curve seem to
register kind of go with the flow of the
room and kind of make it feel as
spacious as it can because it is like a
little bitty flat that's all I really
need so so that's a little overview of
like my lounge room and my little
kitchen area you have to excuse my
babyface appearance I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video obviously it's
not 100% finished yet and it's don't
feel like I don't feel like it ever will
because I'll always want to keep adding
stuff to it and redecorating and all
that kind of stuff so yeah I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and get to kind of
get a taste of the way that I decorate
and all that kind of good stuff so give
