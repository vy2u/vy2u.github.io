this week we are weekly blogging I'm
just gonna wake up I was just looking at
my eyes they look so so tired but we
have a fun day today doing a lot of
filming a couple of Instagram videos
Instagram pictures I'm gonna go I get my
nails done so I'm gonna take you along
with me for that too I just kinda wanted
to a weekly vlog this week because one I
know you guys really like my dog and two
I got quite a few exciting things coming
up I got some dinner parties few
birthdays events all that kind of stuff
so now just gonna make myself some
coffee and chill on the sofa just for an
hour this is new Netflix series that I
want to watch it's called end of the
 world sorry but it is I know
it's got one two actors in it that was
in one of my favorite black mirror
episode so I have a feeling it's gonna
make a really like messed up series well
that's I'm hoping it's gonna be because
I feel like that's a few episodes so
fingers crossed that this is gonna be a
new and Netflix a serious I get into yes
is now a time for coffee before I can't
even function reflect some emails and
yeah that's what we're doing this
morning okay let's see if we like it
time to do a food shows I really this
isn't what I thought it was gonna be if
any of you guys have watched end of the
 world let me know what you
thought or like if it gets better cuz
right now this is just like weird such a
manic morning but now we are off to go
get my nails done because I cannot film
that videos with nails like this anymore
I just spray my perfume if you guys will
know I smell like I smell like Jimmy
Choo blossom honestly one of my favorite
bathrooms ever but yes I've to get my
nails done now at my friend Lauren salon
which is why I always go to and her
salon is so like picturesque so I'm sure
I'll film lots and show you my nails one
mother
guys we got a few apostles while I was
out how incredible is this this is from
Charlotte Tilbury and is to kind of
celebrate I think then it is a new
product brightening youth glow
anti-aging color correcting glow of
booster that sounds insane but look at
this it's like a rose it's roses in the
shape of an R I'm obsessed Charlotte
Toby you go above and beyond this is
insane stop we have a few bits in from
Lancome and they say here is our energy
divvy is it the V energy Davi range that
we would love for you to try I think
it's skincare that is basically meant to
reduce the appearance of tiredness this
one looks like it's illuminating
illuminating an anti-fatigue purifying
and refining and this one is anti
fatigue as well so this is like perfect
I'm so excited to try this thank you so
much Lancome stop is from misguided I
ordered a massive what it's not really
meant to be mastered by all is it's
super oversized like faux fur jacket
because it's one of my closest friends
21st birthday on Saturday and the theme
is kind of like fur and diamonds and
like everything that's bougie so I got
this jacket to wear and oh my god it's
so soft it's that misguided Carli bybel
jacket I can't wait to try it on oh my
god I'm wearing like a big black hoodie
so you can't really tell oh my god this
is so like bougie I hope I've got like
the nail on the head I'm sure you'd have
seen that outfit that I've worn for the
party already on my social media but yes
to the faux fur that looks kind of real
and feels so soft so this is there like
Carli bybel jacket from misguided just
gonna have a really boring spaghetti and
meatballs for lunch and then I'm just
going to sit down and reply to emails
that have had so many come through since
I've been literally out about getting my
nails done and I got some pretty like
abrupt news this morning I've kind of
got a deal with too so much so that I
didn't even get around to doing my food
shop so I'm just gonna be doing a bit of
sitting around boring and then we can
get to filming because I'm these things
like need to be done ASAP and then yet I
can get to filming the content that I
wanted to film today love lists like I
like I said I'm just quickly doing my
food shop before I forget except
literally got no food I'm just gonna
planned out my meals for the week and
obviously there's some nights when I'm
not even here because I'm up in London
so I just kind of like a schedule button
and I feel like that means but I'm not
gonna over by with my food
and yeah things are just a bit more
organized but I have a list so trying to
be healthy as you can see it's a lot of
like rice veg chicken that kind of thing
so yeah this is kind of what I'm gonna
be hopefully it sticking to and eating
this week so you have makeup on for the
first time in a blog in ages I just got
done filming a perfect skin Instagram
tutorial and a like ultimate nude lip
combination it will already have gone up
on my Instagram already but I thought I
would just show you anyway so I'm doing
a little bit of work with a buxom at the
moment and I am literally obsessed with
their new at plump line plumping lip
liners it's such a cool idea and I used
Dee Dee's to it to create this lip combo
this is incognito to outline my lip and
then I used white Russian to fill in my
lip literally it's such a gorgeous pale
nude I love their like Elan lip cream in
White Russian so this color I knew I was
gonna be obsessed with and then on the
top I have two of their full-on lip
polishes in pink daiquiri and pink
champagne literally so obsessed with
this skin and lips so all the details
will be up on my Instagram in regards to
what's on my face right now yeah now I
got to kind of like take this off and go
to hot yoga which I don't think I'm
gonna be able to film cuz it's obviously
a class and other people are gonna be in
there and obviously I don't know if
they're gonna want to be filmed and
stuff I'm so excited but I'll definitely
film afterwards to kind of you know see
how I got on and let you guys know how
it went because I've never done it
before but I am so so so excited hell
that was intense I'm not even joking we
were literally dripping in sweat it's
really like I don't describe the when
it's not difficult but it is really just
like intense and all your muscles and I
feel really just like relaxed and I
definitely feel a little bit more
flexible I feel like that's such a great
way to unwind if you if you feel like
you get stressed enough tension in your
body like for me for example I'm kind of
like sat hunched all day so my body can
get a little bit tense sometimes so that
was a really great way to unwind
definitely gonna try that well
definitely gonna try and do that like
once a week maybe I'm not sure but oh my
god
look I let you half my face is like all
come off but now I've got back I'm
literally so tired that really like
relaxes you makes you feel Zen so I'm
gonna go ahead
and eat some dinner and edit a couple of
Instagram videos really boring stuff and
I'm literally looking at my camera and
it's flashing at me that it's got like
2% so I'm gonna end Monday here promise
you the rest of the week gets a little
bit more exciting so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed my totally a fun day so far
literally gonna have leftover turkey
mince potatoes and kale for those who
that interests because I know some of
you guys already actually into what I'm
eating at the moment yes you see ugh let
you put my dressing out on I'm so tired
I'm gonna eat this edit the videos and
go to bed so I'll see you tomorrow for a
day was a good start to the morning when
Sainsbury's arrives and we are done time
to make breakfast so for breakfast today
we're having avocados scrambled eggs had
some whole meal toast so I got kind of
like what's it called it's like a batch
loaf it's like really small bits of
bread so I'm not so it kind of feels
like I'm eating full bread then I
actually am kind of satisfied my bread
cravings and it is multi seed and
wholemeal dad and my sister taught me
the way of doing scrambled eggs by
literally doing it straight into the pan
so I'm just gonna use the tiniest bit of
spread then a couple of eggs and a
drizzle of milk probably like a pinch of
salt as well and then I have another car
in here so if another car I'll think so
let's get cooking
now we have it guys this is breakfast so
some avocado scrambled eggs couple of
bits of toast orange juice and a coffee
now I'm gonna do a my morning ritual of
just sitting down replying to emails I
got overnight and the work that I need
to respond to but today I'm gonna be
filming a Q&amp;amp;A I'm gonna be posting at my
Instagram video well one of the
Instagram videos and then put me a Q&amp;amp;A
for tomorrow's video so again that will
already be up I will insert a card here
to go and watch I'm sure we all have
tons of fun on that video yeah I've just
got boring stuff to do today quite a lot
of you know I mentioned that yesterday I
got some news that I kind of need to
like act upon quite quickly gonna be
dealing with that and yeah I thought
today is gonna be a day of like I think
I'm gonna like freshly fake tan today as
well it's just gonna be a one of those
days you know I've got my friends a
dinner party tonight which is gonna be
so fun so I'm sure I'll be getting ready
for that as well so I can't wait to show
you the kind of look that I do okay so
I'm literally just about to have a
shower but we are going serious with our
hair today so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use this to kind of like a book is
basically when you have hair extensions
you have to dry your hair instantly you
can't really let them just air dry like
all the time so basically I'm doing it
this kind of process doesn't only blow
drying my hair this is like that diamond
oil globe dry shampoo wait actually I
think you put this on first so this is
like a pre shampoo treatment then I'm
gonna shampoo my hair with the kind of
corresponding shampoo then I'm gonna do
a Mark Hill hair mask now I googled if
you can do her must when you have pre
bonded hair extensions in it and
apparently extensions love kind of masks
that have argan oil and Moroccan oil in
it and that's what this one hasn't it's
only a two-minute mask so I'm gonna do
that first shampoo then this and then
conditioner so we're really gonna be
nourishing our hair today and I'm really
hope this works my hair is been feeling
so dry recently so I just thought I
would show you how I'm gonna wash my
hair so that you just wash my hair and
it's feeling it so a soft I can't wait
to kinda like a dryer and see how it
feels when it's dry but I think I'm
gonna um you know the Lancome skin
Cabot's I got the other day I think I'm
gonna try this on let you know how I get
on with these I feel like there's always
gonna be regular shots of me in my
bathroom doing my skincare but this
brush is so good
for brushing through your hair when it's
wet it's actually called a wet brush so
I think that's kind of like what it's
for
when you have my component hair
extensions it's better to use a
hairbrush that has like v wide spaced
bristles so this one for instance or a
like tangle teezer anything that's not
going to tug too hard on your hair so it
just kind of brushes through it with
ease so I did apply kind of like those a
blow dry pair type treatments to my hair
so I'm just gonna brush but I go brush
through at one side and then do the
other and it's just like I might as well
not even brushed it when I get to the
other side it's like that complete your
not T mess but this brush makes it so
much easier okay Harris brush and while
its weight or Kylie's just dry a little
bit more okay and while it's not wet and
drying I'm just gonna put the mark he'll
Mauritius Moroccan argan oil kind of
like hair oil in that you apply before
you applying heat to your hair sir
before I dry it I'm just gonna run this
through my wet hair as well these bits
of my hair always I like the most dry
and you're gonna make sure I get all of
them I kind of just like tap over the
hair extensions so they don't get
clogged with product or anything so
that's one of the things you have to do
when you're when you have these hair
extensions I think I actually need to
get mine read I feel like it's about
time okay so that's kind like my hair
done now I'm excited to try these so
this is the liquid hooker Royce Kyser I
think oh my god it's green it's green
it's all in French I read in French the
Seas defective there oh my god I can't
even read that
never mind apply evenly on the face in
the morning or the evening okay that's
literally all it says to do just on a
few pumps gonna do like circular motions
I feel like turgut the blood pumping in
my skin I have to say I've been using
that you know I used in my morning
routine skin care the hyaluronic acid in
the mornings and the
and also in the evenings I apply the
Estee Lauder night repair my skin has
never looked and felt so soft and so
good and no even kidding
that acid stuff I think it's really
really good I've had her mine I've had
it was good but I didn't like I didn't
have a product that had it in - no it
was good and then ever since I got that
and I've been using it it's honestly
like changed my skin and we've been
kidding
okay now let's try the corresponding PI
cream I got my nails yesterday so now I
literally can't open okay there we go
yes to the green and this - okay so this
one's got more feel like illuminating oh
my god it's got little metal roller
balls on it so I'm guessing you just
screw boom
squeeze and roll Oh oh my god that feels
so nice my friend alex is about to come
over and we're going to sort through my
clothes because I'm gonna be starting a
deep avocado I've got so much clothes
I've only worn one anywhere or actually
never even worn like I've bought it
tried it on I like try it on like way
too late and then it's been too late to
return so I'm just kind of like kept it
and hung it up but the label still on so
then go through my codes and just like -
son we're going deep pop so expect ad
pop account from me soon lunch today
guys we're having a super exciting
chicken Caesar salad hi guys it's like a
couple of hours later now oh my god

just getting myself ready for my friends

don't know I'm you probably it's see me
