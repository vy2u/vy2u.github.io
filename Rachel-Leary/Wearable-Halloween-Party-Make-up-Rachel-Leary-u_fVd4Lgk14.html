already started by prepping my eyes and
doing my eyebrows then I'm going in with
this orange eye shadow from The Velvet
59 exotic Lotus palette and Joseph
buffing that into my socket you guys
know the drill I'm then going in with
something slightly deeper from the same
palette Swiss chocolate from Mac is
really similar and using this just
further deep in the socket creating that
transition
taking redbrick by mac cosmetics I am
then pressing this all over my lid as
our new shade
with no added product on my brush I'm
just going back in and just softening
out the edges then I'm using this
pigment from neve cosmetics in the shade
ticket and my Mac mixing medium I am
just putting a tiny amount of this all
over my lid and then pressing the
pigment over the top just to really
bring out the color and emphasize the
metallic finish
this is an optional step I just wanted
to do something a little extra I'm going
in with mac cosmetics reflex bronze and
just spraying my eye with fix+ first to
add a bit of adhesive to the eye and
then pressing it on the top this just
kind of adds to the orangie pumpkiny
vibe that I was going for going back in
with that warm brown shade I'm just
using the brush from before as well and
just softening out the edges and making
sure there is no harsh lines using the
darker Brown through the shame Pat same
same palette the same palette I am just
again creating that transition from
light to dark and just adding it into my
soccer
using a wipe I'm gonna create that wing
you guys could have used tape to do this
or I make army but every doesn't matter
I just prefer to use a wipe so I can
really get my nail under and get that
really sharp edge
someone needs to recommend me a new
liquid liner but as always using my NYC
liquid liner to create that wing then
going in with the sparkly black
eyeshadow from the same Lotus palette
and using it to kind of create a really
soft cut crease I am gonna go in with a
bit more of a firmer brush to do so but
just creating that initial shape
I'm just using my it cosmetics mascara
but just to apply a light coat in
preparation for false eyelashes the
lashes I'm going to be using our super
voluminous they are midnight symphony by
isquite oh and I am in love with them
then I'm going in with ghetto by Mac
which is basically just a matte white
eyeshadow to highlight my inner corner
and brow bone
onto the face I'm hydrating my skin with
my mac fix+ as always and then going in
with my early two-in-one hydration and
blur primer just to prep my skin for
foundation and then going in with my
Maybelline fit me foundation in the
shade 220 to match the color of my face
to my neck as my face is a lot paler
than my body as you guys probably know
by now using my Rimmel wake me up
concealer in the shade ivory I think
this is I'm just using this to conceal
underneath my eyes
to set that in place I'm using the
yellow tone shade from the Kat Von D
shade and light palette and just
pressing that underneath my eyes using
my Sigma tapered highlighting brush to
create a bit more of a stronger contour
than usual I'm taking the coolest shade
from the same palette and just carving
out my cheekbones with this zoeva brush
as it's kind of a Halloween party look I
do kind of want to make things look a
bit more extra than normal so that's why
I am contouring a bit stronger than I
usually would to warm up my cheeks I'm
just using my Mac mineralized skinfinish
in the shade give me Sun all around my
face to highlight my cheeks I'm going
back in with that Neve cosmetics pigment
it's such a gorgeous bronze shade I
thought why not use it as a highlighter
it's got such nice reflex to it and it
kind of adds to the party look
so then plead the eyes I'm going back in
with this ardency in supercharged
eyeliner in black and just loving this
quite messily along my lower lashline
and waterline then using red brick by
Mac iron using this to buffer out
and then pressing the Neve cosmetics
pigment on top of all of that just to
complete the look
and that is the eyes complete now onto
the lips using this liquid lipstick from
anastasia beverly hills i am just
applying that all over my lips then
using a clear lip glass from mac and re
and the reflex the 3d black glitter just
pressing that over the top you guys
don't have to do that i just thought it
would add to the halloween look but that
is it i really hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial i have a few more
Halloween tutorials lined up that
slightly more on the creative side so
until then I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
