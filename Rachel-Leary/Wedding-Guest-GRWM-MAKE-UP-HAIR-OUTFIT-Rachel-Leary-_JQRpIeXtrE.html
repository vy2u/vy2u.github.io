channel so today I saw my cousin's
wedding coming up and what better video
to do it then a wedding guests get ready
with me I'm just going to be a guest I'm
not like a bridesmaid or anything like
that so I just thought this is the
approaches made like prom season or it
is literally wedding season I feel like
most people are getting married at the
noumenal going to wedding and going to
like glamorous events and stuff maybe
even like the races or something that
you could use this for so I thought I
would show you my makeup I plan to wear
all my clothing and accessories and not
to mention my hair but yes I've left the
links to everything and all the
information you will need down below I
kind of went for a rose gold soft look
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
makeup look the outfit and the hair and
everything else involved definitely make
sure to give this video a week do enjoy
it and let me know down in the comments
either get ready with me you might like
to see because I know you guys love them
so much
yeah without further ado you can see how
I go from zero to 100 and just came back
you can see the whole process of this
look okay so to begin we are going to do
a skin side so just make sure to get all
your hair up the place you have a purse
a face I always love my cat ears and now
I'm going to use this hero project glow
jobs I've been loving these under makeup
just doing a couple of drops of these
onto my skin and then at blending that
in with a Beauty Blender the primer I'm
going to take it to that face hangover
primer I love this it's kind of infuse
it with coconut so it's really good for
your skin smells very good as well and I
find my makeup sit and lot amazingly
with it then I'm going to give myself
the ultimate glow underneath and it mix
these two enhancing drops from cover
effects in the shades sunlight and
moonlight and literally just brush this
all over my skin I don't want this to be
like a really sick layer so I'm going to
go over with my sponge make sure it's
all blended in I just really want a nice
glow from within and some underneath I'm
going to be going in with quite a few
foundations so I don't want to lose the
glow as I just said to the foundations
we're going to be using our my Mac
Studio Fix
and mixing it with Giorgio Armani in the
shade 7 because it's a lot more of a
neutral color and I find Studio Fix
mp38 things to be quite yellow I mix
them together to get my perfect shade
and to match my tans
for concealer I'm again mixing two I'm
taking the American pleat coverage
concealer in the shade canal which is
like quite close to my skin color and I
find when you use a concealer that's
quite close to your skin color and blend
in it gives you a really a brand
flawless finish and this conceal have
such amazing coverage it just and it
does just that and then I'm taking from
collection mm this is one of their new
kind of correcting ones I think I
couldn't find the link to this exact one
but I found the exact same one in the
palette form and this is in the shade
lemon so it's a yellow base and I'm
going to use it to brighten up if you've
ever tried it considered before you know
it's a really amazing coverage as well
which is why I'm always using my models
own sponge to blend it in so it's not
too thick on the skin the cream contour
I'm taking it the Anastasia Beverly
Hills mink cream contour kit which is
really cool toned and then this Beach
stick from Charlotte Tilbury in the
shade I'd be there as you can i betta
iviva iviva oh my god I can't even say
the word Ibiza and I'm just going to
blend that in and use that to warm it up
I don't like to kind of just use warm
tones as the cream contour I like to mix
me together just because using something
called it owns a lot more real and then
the warm tone just kind of warms up your
complexion then I'm going to set
everything in place with power and bake
underneath my eyes just because I plan
to use pigments and glitter in case they
fall down I'm going to leave the powder
there and then just making sure I'm
baking underneath the contour and
everything and then dusting what's left
on the brush to set everything else in
place for brows I'm taking my precisely
brow pencil from benefit in the shade
three and four for towards the end of my
brow and three towards the front and
then I'm just going to use the same
nails consider that we used previously
to sculpt out underneath my eyebrows and
give me a nice highlight and then
setting everything in place using the
makeup forever browser set and I think
this is in the shade 15 it's a really
light one for the eye today I'm taking
this amazing palette this is the Attar
maneater palette I definitely wanted to
be rose gold in my eyes and all the kind
of lists totally go with rose gold so
I'm taking that / shade I think is which
is a really nice pinky it's soft warm
Brown and just blending that in it with
a big fluffy brush and then I'm further
deepening it with this media matte brown
shade
here just going back and forth and then
always going back in with the previous
blush blush I can't even talk the
previous brush to make sure everything
is really it blended in together and
there's no harsh lines then I'm taking
this a dark brown shade here and just
concentrating this mainly on the outer
portion of the eye because I don't like
to be too intense I wanted to keep the
eyes quite soft but I did want to keep
them quite sultry because I know
personally this makeups gotta last me
day tonight and I don't mind having kind
of dark sultry makeup during the day so
I'm now going to go ahead and you think
concealer and kind of carve out my
creases slightly but I kind of just want
to use this to give myself a really good
of place when I applied the pigment so I
didn't want it to be too much of a half
harsh cut crease that was look I was
really going for but for the pigment I'm
taking this gorgeous rose gold pigment
from peaches makeup this is in the shade
peach and I'm just pressing it onto
basically where we just applied the
concealer and as the concealer is quite
damp it has something to cling to
then I'm taking this rose gold shade on
a flat shader brush and using that to
diffuse the lid color in it to the
crease color as you can see just there
so you've got like a light to dark
gradient and taking this matte white
shade I'm going to use that to highlight
my inner corner and my brow bone then
I'm going to take this shade called
guilt from model zone it is one of their
eye cold and just running that in at my
waterline and then taking the shade pair
on my lower lash line and buffing that
out I really like this color in the
water and I feel like it just adds a
little bit something extra but nothing
it too dark then I wanted a little bit
of gold glitter to tie with everything
so I'm just taking reflex gold from Mac
and at dampening it with six-plus then
going in with these lashes these are the
goddess lashes from Lily lashes I'm
obsessed they're so dramatic but yet
kind of I feel like you can get away
from for like every data so wispy but
now going back onto the face I'm going
to brush away all the powder and contour
using the nip and fab contour kit in the
shade medium who knew that nip and fab
did cosmetics I didn't I'm literally
loving them so far and this is not my
favorite products on the skin for events
this is Mac global go skin finish and
I'm just using a big fluffy brush to
dust that everywhere it's like a
shimmery bronzer and using one of my
favorite rose gold toned blushes in
Luminoso from Milani
and then highlighting using my favorite
highlighting palette this is the sleek
Cleopatra's kiss and then I'm just lying
my lips I think this is the NYX a
neutral lip liner and then going in with
the ellipse and liquid lip in Venus
which is like a rose the kind of pinky
nudie color that tied everything
together and you could leave it matte
but I did want a little bit of glitter
and this is the L'Oreal disco blah so
this is the finished makeup look I think
this is perfect for any sort of glam
event like obviously being a wedding
guest prom or Ascot now let's move on to
hair so for this look I wanted to wear
my extension so I thought I just insert
a clip of what my hair looks like
without extensions I mean I don't really
them for length but I do love them too
like that extra length and volume so the
ones I'm going to be using art from
felony I have listed them at down below
but first I'm going to be occurring my
hair and this is the color that I use I
think it's a 6 and 1 1 from Bellamy and
I take the biggest barrel because I kind
of wanted to loose beachy waves and you
can see I do have a discount code if you
guys want to try it it comes with loads
of different sizes so you can kind of
get a range of looks and then I'm just
going to go ahead and it spray the hair
so it all kind of last and will last
throughout the day so I'm just going to
go through and layer by layer I always
like to section off my hair I don't like
to do it all at once and I feel like I
missed it so I'm just a section of my
hair and then I always tie it back and
then repeat the process by taking medium
bits down like it and I take medium bits
I hold it for literally like 20 seconds
you guys know this room and then the
continue to counter this is when my hair
is done I make sure I've sprayed it all
with hairspray as well and then I can go
ahead and apply it my extensions so
these are the ones that I'm using I
thought I would insert which ones I'm
using and show you what is actually
included in the packet it does come with
a test a bit so you can test it to the
color of your hair and if they don't
work then you can send them back but I'd
like to curl them before I put them in
my hair so I'm just using like a little
clamp and then I go ahead and curl them
it just makes it so much easier I'm not
like getting tangled in my curler and
the hair extensions and all that so yep
just cutting them and spraying them with
hairspray like I did with my natural
hair and then I'm going to go ahead and
it takes the two this and put that on
the bottom as it's the smallest part I
make sure to backcomb the roots to make
sure that it's got something to grip
onto and I do have a discount code as
well which I've listed on the top there
if you are interested in getting your
own extensions so yeah just applying the
two and then I separate it in the mid
and then I apply the afore clipped one
which I think is the biggest weft of one
because it's the biggest part of my head
so I'm just attaching that across there
as well and I did get these ones in a
slightly lighter color but that is
because I do prefer a highlighted look
to run through my hair and I feel like
that just looks slightly more unnatural
but yeah so then I make sure to kind of
just give it that those usual make sure
it's all covered and then I'm going to
apply two of the three clip ones to the
side of my hair again just to add some
more length and make sure the color is
all really balanced throughout and again
I have pre curled all of these so they
should blend in nicely so just repeating
the process on the other side you can
add as many of the extensions that you
want depending on how much volume you
need how much length you want but this
is a sufficient amount for me and this
is my hair with the extension so as you
can see it just adds lots of volume and
length and I'm obsessed with this look
and now we can move on to the outfit so
this is my chosen outfit I know you guys
have seen this already and I have left
everything in the description bar down
below for you if you are interested but
this is the finished look I literally
love it it's very soft and elegant

full swing here so this is the finished
