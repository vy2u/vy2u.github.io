as you can tell by the title in today's
video I am gonna be showing you what I
got for Christmas I've been doing a lot
of makeup tutorials recently so I wanted
to get out a nice chapter one and I
asked you guys on Twitter which one you
wanted to see nice and obviously by the
tight you can tell this one was the
winner so without going on I'm just
gonna show you what I got
so I'll start off with both what I'm
wearing I don't know if you guys know
this but my sister lives in America
which is why I went out there not that
long ago and so she got me this sweater
basically just one of those comfy
sweaters fleece lined that around this
time of year I don't know about any of
you guys but I literally live in things
like this so I love this one and
obviously it means a lot more because
it's got how university like stuff on it
so yeah that was also for my sister she
also got me this Marc Jacobs eyeshadow
stick basically when I went out there
and we went to Sephora a lot I was
tossing out whether or not to get this
and I decided not to just because I
already bought way too much you guys saw
it he watched the whole I did but she
got it for me for Christmas so I'm super
happy it is is this like champagne gold
kind of color it's called vulvar and
it's one of the Marc Jacobs twinkle pop
cream eyeshadows and like I said I'm
already and number there on days where
my carbon bullet or a lot of makeup a
cream eyeshadows are one of my favorite
put up to you so I'm giving a lot of
these up this one and I'm pretty sure I
saw somewhere that Mario Mezen makeup my
Mario use this on Kim Kardashian or kind
Jenner or one of the others which is why
I really wanted to try them in the first
place
so yeah I think another makeup bit I'll
show you kind of like the main issues I
got from my mum and dad I suppose it
wasn't really a Christmas present that
it came around Christmas so I'll call it
Christmas present is my iPhone and six
I don't know if you guys knew this
before I had an iPhone 5s before there's
absolutely smashed to pieces so I was in
dire need of a new one it actually broke
I tweeted tell you guys my phone died
which so I couldn't do a lot like social
media stuff like that so this is what I
got
technically from my mom and dad around
Christmas so I'm grateful to have this
but another make me bit that I got and
was broody desperate have is this Oh
hourglass palette options open it so it
is so reflective one thing I love about
its what a giant mirror in it so maybe
you'll just like it radio something like
that it's perfect to just hold up and
look into but I'm absolutely in love
there this is the the diffuse light
powder that I already have with some
miniature and then these I think
technically a face powders but I love
this these it's like blushes and
obviously these or the hourglass blushes
as well this one's do is it these two
are kind of slightly more important the
ones the downs of see a blusher and I
was really desperate for this and I kept
telling my mom saying mom like you don't
get it like palettes like this they sell
out really quickly and sometimes online
exclusives like Andrea guess what a
bitch is paying pushes it what see we'll
see but yes I'm so happy to have this
because I've really desperately wanted
to try the hourglass blushes and I
generally love hourglass as a brand
anyway so perfect present another person
that I got this hat I didn't you guys
know this but I am a big fat person I
like to wear I like to wear hats not
necessarily around my friends have stuff
like that just because I still feel
they're one of those things that people
still aren't you Mary
but if I was like on my own or going to
a meeting like that I like to wear hats
and this one has a little kind of like
like a leather belt around it and it's
just more this kind of fluffy fedora
hats and it is from and other stories
mines 2006 pessimist in Oscar Christmas
or anything like that so I really like
it it's really good like sturdy material
and I'll and other stories is a really
good brand for clothes and accessories
anyway
in terms of that's slightly expensive
but for what you get it's kind of worth
it Nathan Murray I don't really have the
hair right now but yeah I really really
like this and I can't wait to wear it
sort of more into the spring and stuff
like that just I'm just kind of diving
into this bag obviously although I'm not
actually a massive chocolate eater in
the sense that the only chops I can
really eat is dark chocolate milk
chocolate really breaks me out like the
next day I know that happens a lot of
people Envy me it'd be like it's if I
eat I am going to get a spot in ski like
there's no two ways about it I don't
know why so I'll slowly make my way
through them I'm sure my family will how
many hands so some other makeup if it's
that I got were some brush cleanser from
and other stories as well this sponge
from is it nan Chi I think as I've seen
loads of people use their brushes before
and so I've heard about the brand so to
get the sponges really excited so I can
kind of just test the waters and to go
with it I've got the Beauty Blender
cleaner which I have the liquid form of
it so I'm really excited to use this in
terms of like quick cleaning spot
cleaning brushes apparently this is
amazing for that so I love getting like
useful presents like the ice I'm going
to use like this there's like these are
the kind of presents that I love a lot
more ungrateful everything's that useful
presents love these also I both show you
it just like a couple of stalking me
bits that I got so this is really random
but my mom knows that I love bees and
their black cotton bud I mean it's
literally like cotton buds but black
that you get from Muji and I obsess over
these just because you know you're just
cleaning up it something like that you
don't want to see whatever really you
know it's kind of just gross anyway so
having a black ear buds just means that
you don't see anything it looks a lot I
don't know I just so much with our black
ones and they just look cooler as well
so I love these also I got a pair of
plain black gloves but you can use while
using your iPhone so they were so you
can use your iPhone while you book got
some basically say keeping your hands
warm and going phone at the same time so
love these like I said another really
useful present I know I'm going to use
in the sense that at the moment in
England it's actually really quite warm
so I don't need gloves yeah but
apparently in January favourites meant
to get ice cold so I'm sure these will
come in handy so I did get like a few
other bits as well but kind of the last
name present that I got was this do they
cover from my grandparents it is like
that designs I asked for this just
because it kind of reminded me of like a
play button and that make sense it kind
of reminded me of filming and stuff like
that so I thought if I do more chai tea
videos not necessarily with this
background and this is my duvet or look
a lot nicer because this is kind of the
background I have what I'm doing my
makeup tutorial so you're not distracted
by things around me anymore
because you guys said you preferred
having more of a plain background but if
I do more chai tea videos I kind of
in a bit more of a relaxed setting where
I'm gonna work on making my room look a
bit nice and videos like that so I
thought what better way than to get a
really nice duvet cover and this one is
from Urban Outfitters it says it is a
hundred percent cotton so I'm hoping I
might put on tonight and so I was lucky
enough to get a few Christmas presents
from some brands as well just around
this time of year I'm lucky enough to
receive some gift packages but I won't
go into that I just thought I would show
you my favourite one which is from a
soap &amp;amp; Glory they sent me a little
teacup and little tea cup and saucer
that says gin on it and to go with it
sent me like a circle or like a cocktail
recipe book which is so sweet because
when I went to their event not that long
ago best was best as among people that
works at soap &amp;amp; Glory we were looking at
the cocktails menu I wasn't a bit sure
which one to get and she told me to get
pink teaser which came in a cup like
this and she was wrong it was delicious
so this is sold like a super special
present and oh my maid that always
because I feel like when brands go off
their way to send you a present that
isn't part of their product if that
makes sense like the book is theirs but
the cup isn't if that makes sense like
it just means a lot more and I love them
so much over there so thank you so much
I'm so grateful for them present I love
tea anyway
that is kind of everything I got for
Christmas guys
worth showing you guys so you'll be
interested in obviously I got loads of
the other stocking Lee bits but they're
bit more you know it's interesting it's
kind of name present so yeah I hope you
