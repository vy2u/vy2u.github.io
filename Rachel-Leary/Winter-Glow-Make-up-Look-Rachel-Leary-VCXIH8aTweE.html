hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today we are starting with the face
first and I'm using my Bobbi Brown
moisturizer just to hydrate my skin and
then using my Smashbox hydrating primer
just to give my foundation a really good
base and also again to hydrate the skin
and get that kind of glowing effect for
foundation I'm gonna be using two
products I'm gonna be mixing my NARS all
day luminous foundation with the NAS
liquid highlighter in the shade for one
3b a health care are not really sure but
that's what it says on there and then
going ahead and doing my eyebrows I do
have a tutorial on this and I always
leave it in the link below just because
everyone always does that eyebrows
differently so I don't always go into it
in tutorials then using the it cosmetics
concealer by by under-eye in the shade
light just in the normal places to
highlight under my eyes and around my
face and using a damp sponge to blend
out too soon I turn and can we ever be
there are the bands are watches soon to
set that in place I'm using my Mac
Studio Fix powder in the shade NC 20
with my Sigma tapered highlighting brush
as this is like the best under eye brush
ever it's what that tapered edge so you
can really get underneath your eye and
you can use the code Sigma 2016 or 10%
off then using the Loreal bronzer in the
shade 0-2
just too lightly bronze my skin because
this is kind of more of a cool tone look
I didn't want to add too much warmth so
that's why I'm going in with the cooler
tone Anastasia Beverly Hills glow care
if you can get your hands on these they
are phenomenal and i'm using the morphe
fan brush to apply it I mix the two pay
the bottom shades to get that kind of
pretty pearly glow to the skin
sticking with the cool-toned theme I am
taking his Max Factor blush in the shade
nude move and using my Sigma blusher
brush just to apply this to the apples
of my cheeks for that kind of include of
moving on to the eyes I've already
prepped my eyes using my mac prolongwear
paper in soft ochre then I am taking the
shade unconditional from the lorac
unzipped palette on my Sigma e-40 fluffy
brush and just softly are blending that
into the crease in a kind of blown out
shape
just say
taking the shade unspoken from the lorac
unzipped palette as well on a morphe m4
1/2 which is kind of more of a tapered
blending brush managers using this to
further deepen up the crease there are
the bands are watching feeling
for the lid shade I'm taking this cream
eyeshadow in the shade
he Co which is this really gorgeous kind
of moody silvery shade and I'm asked to
me the number day it's perfect these
kind of bullet own looks when you're
using more mode shades in the crease
they really go together so well and I'm
just taking that same morphe brush the
tiny bit of the unconditional shade it
just to blend the two products together
then I'm taking a tiny bit of the same
cream eyeshadow on my inner corner on my
lower lash line
I really wanted to highlight my inner
corner pretty intently to this look just
kind of go with the wintry I see cool
tone feel so I am eating mac pigment in
vanilla on a pencil brush to do that
then I am taking unconditional from the
lorac palette again and just blending
that on my lower lash line
as I said before I really wanted bright
eyes for the sex I'm using the white
noise pencil from sleep in my inner
corner to achieve that you can go ahead
and leave it there with the mascara but
you know me I always have to wear lashes
and these are the lure lashes in the
style Carlie lash something just really
wispy and winged out and not too
dramatic so you can still see the silver
shadow on the lid then for the lip
sticking with the cooler tone theme I am
a taking oak pencil from Mac and then
using the lipstick from a bite Beauty in
the shade rexine I think I saw out money
anyway use it in a favorites video once
and I had to get it and I'm in love with
it and then taking one of the
highlighting shades just to highlight my
Cupid's bow and that is it I really hope
you enjoyed this tutorial make sure to
give it a thumbs up and leave any future
suggestions in the comments below and
until next time I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
