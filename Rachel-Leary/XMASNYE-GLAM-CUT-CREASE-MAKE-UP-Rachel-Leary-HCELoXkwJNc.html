today I'm not sure when I'm actually up
hosting this so first of all if you
didn't already know I might be in Los
Angeles right now I mean you want to see
all the exciting things I'm getting up
to it make sure to follow me on my
social here if I post this when I'm home
then just follow me anyway so today I'm
doing a kind another holiday look I said
that this is totally appropriate for
more like a New Year's Eve glam or
Christmas if you're like feeling extra
this year basically it's just a ultra
glam look perfect for any sort of event
that you might have coming up there's
more of their like pinky a burgundy R
tones there's a lot of makeup in this
tutorial what's new there's olive
glitter there's gloss there's wings
there's all that kind of good stuff I
have left all the products I have used
in the description bar down below for
you guys to check out so if you want to
see a what on how I created this look
then it make sure to give it a thumbs up
subscribe if you haven't already and
then just continue watching so I'm gonna
go ahead and do my brows first but don't
worry guys I am gonna be doing an
updated browser 18 very soon but I was
just using my anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow in medium brown and setting them
all in place with my it benefit gimme
brow and I think this is the shade at
three then I'm gonna go ahead and prime
my eyes this is the urban decay eater
primer potion and it also works as a
pretty nice brow bone highlight too cuz
it's like that flash concealer color so
I'm taking it all the way underneath my
brows as well and then making sure to
just set it in place with powder and
then for eyeshadow today I definitely
wanted to go for more of a a pinky
burgundy vibe I never do this so I'm
taking it the mode Confessions eyeshadow
palette from huda beauty it's so small
and cute I love it and I'm just going
from light to dark and using all of the
pink and berry tones so just going in
with this rosy color here just to build
up some depth and then again doing the
same emotions with this dark berry shade
on a similar brush if not the same again
just building up the color and depth to
create that smoky eye it doesn't matter
if you take it quite far onto the lid
because we are going to be carving it
out with concealer but I always make
sure that it is a blended by going back
in with my previous fluffy brushes again
going in with an even darker berry color
I'm literally loving these tones around
this
yeah I know like Burgundy smokey eyes
like a big thing so when I saw this
palette I knew I wanted to do a look and
I wanted it to be ultra glam so
basically just creating that smoky eye
effect going from light to dark and then
like I said we're going to take a
concealer this is the benefit boying
concealer and just use this to a carve
out our lids and create that cut crease
look and I'm just taking a small
concealer brush to do this you want to
make sure that you're using quite a
pigmented concealer otherwise the
eyeshadow is just going to blend into
the concealer and it's gonna be like a
hot mess so I find it this one to be
really goodness actually kind of pink
based already so kind of ties in with
the eyeshadow - speaking of which for
the lid color I'm using the same palette
I let you use this palette to do the
whole eye look which is super super
handy I'm just taking this light
shimmery pinky rosy color kind of 3/4 of
the way across the lid taking it up into
the crease - and then using it there's a
darker pink color to kind of finish off
the crease so it goes from light to dark
across the crease as well obviously it's
not gonna be a New Year's Eve or
Christmas look without any glitter and
this is the amok reflex glitter in
reflex red you guys know I am obsessed
with there reflex closers they're so
subtle and they just give the most
gorgeous glittery look without too much
pigmentation and this reflex red has
kind of like yeah an element of red and
pink to it so perfect to tighten with
the tones of this look and then finally
going in with this dark purplish shade
and using a small shader brush to place
the product on the outermost part of the
eye and also use it to kind of carve out
the crease as well then we can just take
a makeup wipe to create the shape which
is what helps to do your brows before
cause it gives you somewhere to kind of
aim - and you're doing that and then
just gonna highlight are in a corner and
brow bone with the matte white shade
from the palette and then we can line
our lids this is the Urban Decay
razorsharp liquid Lila and a high liner
oh my god I feel like this has replaced
my NYC liquid eyeliner it is so precise
and so a black you literally get a
razor-sharp eyeliner no joke so it
literally does exactly what it says on
the tin and I am obsessed and the lashes
I'm taking the Audrey lashes from at Who
Dat Beauty because they are the most
gorgeous winged fluttery lashes to tie
in with that eye look onto the skin I'm
taking the for Sally I think this is the
24 karat gold
elixir serum oil whatever I knew I was
going in with quite a heavy duty
foundation so I do like to wear an oil
underneath
have normal to dry skin like mine this
works really well if you know you're
gonna be wearing a full coverage
foundation I'm also going to be
moisturizing too using my glam glow this
is the matte glow moisturizer obsessed
with this smells incredible I've used it
loads of times before
honestly the nicest feeling moisturizer
ever and then I felt like I had quite a
lot like of ceremi moisturizers on my
face so if a primer I'm taking the Too
Faced three-in-one a primer spray so I
wasn't going to be applying like another
cream speaking of the foundation I'm
taking the NARS all day luminous
foundation and mixing it with the
Giorgio Armani power fabric foundation
I'm doing this because one I want super
super full coverage and two the NARS one
that I had is actually quite yellow
based and the Giorgio Armani one that I
had was more neutral based I think I've
left the shade names down below so the
mix of them together kind of gave my
perfect shade I was obviously quite
turned at the time so it doesn't quite
intimidating I promise you it matched
and then obviously I like to a color
balance it out with my concealer anyway
but then I apply with a brush to get the
maximum coverage and then just go over
with my sponge to make sure it's not
just sitting on my skin it is actually
it pressed in and it's all blended
together then if I can see that I'm
taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills a
cream contour kit I think this is the
lightest one and taking it the middle
light concealer shade and just applying
it with a brush I do like to do a little
bit of Beauty oil with this product so I
just do a couple of drops into it to
help really make it creamy and blendable
on to the skin and I just applying that
in all the place that I want to
highlight which tends to be underneath
my eyes and down the center of my face I
never really higher up my forehead
anymore I don't know why I just find my
foreheads really dry and whenever I
place any product there it's kind of
hard to blend out so I kind of avoid it
but then I'm just gonna be applying it
the darkest warm contour shade to at my
cheeks and my jaw line on my chin and
then around my forehead as well this
axes are really amazing eye contour and
also like a cream bronzer as well and it
blends it's so easy I apply oil with
this too and then I just use a tanned
duo fibre brush to blend that out also
then obviously I'm just gonna set
everything in place with powder as
that's kind of the last of the creams I
have been obsessed with this ever since
I got it this is the beauty bakery
translucent setting powder honestly it
makes you look so so airbrush I'm just
using that to help sharpen up my contour
as well and then again make underneath
my eyes to help brighten it up and set
the rest of my face I've been reaching
for this over any of my other powders
it's a game changer and then if a
bronzer I'm taking it be a buxom at
tahiti a bronze I think this smells
amazing - it literally it smells like
chocolate just applying that to all the
places that I applied my contour just to
kind of set that in place and add a bit
more warmth and then also to contour my
nose slightly - this blush literally I
thought was perfect for this look it is
the benefit dandelion blusher I never
really reach for this but it was the
perfect pink tone to tighten with it the
eyes and it obviously isn't gonna be a
glam look if I don't use a @ shimmery
bronzer come on now this is the Ofra I
think it's glow girls I'm not sure but
you barely need any of this so you can
see I'm being it's super super light
with my hands when applying this cuz I
don't want to go to too heavy and for
creme illuminated today I am it taking
the cover effects illuminating it drops
I think this is in the shade moonlight
I've definitely left the name of it down
below just blending that in on the tops
of my cheekbones to act as a base for
when we go in with our powder
highlighter which today is gonna be at
the Kylie cosmetics loose glitter powder
highlighter something like that in the
shade of Fiji literally when it goes on
top of the cream oh my god it literally
pops I'm obsessed and just dusting this
over the top of where I placed the cream
and then just in the usual places which
is like down the center of my face and
on my Cupid's bow essentially just all
the places that I want to bring forward
and enhance so if you have like a
slightly longer nose I wouldn't
recommend applying highlighter there
that is also a trick that Anastacio it
gave me I can't wait to do that video
and give you all the tips and tricks
that she gave me but anyway back to this
tutorial I'm going in with the pink
shade that we use I think second in our
crease just tying that in with the eyes
and just rain that Undine underneath on
my lower lash line and then just
applying mascara to complete the eyes
moving on its lips finally this is the
Jane Iredale lip pencil in nude this
used to be such an old favorite of mine
it's like such a nice contour
I'd say and I like to over line my lips
so this is like the perfect cut it it
creates of the illusion of shadow and
makes them look so so so full and this
isn't the ANU emultion liquid lipstick
in the shade you bit more it was
actually more pink than I thought but
actually it kind of liked it and I do
neutralize it with a gloss in a second
as you'll see but you can totally it
feel free to use whatever color you want
stealer caramel Oh fYI I feel like would
be a really nice nude with this look
because it's kind of like a purpley nude
but I just went with a lip gloss on top
and this is one of the newer dazzle
glasses from Mac just to add at that
glossy effect and that is the finished
look then I'm gonna go ahead and set
everything in place with the cover
effects illuminating spray I love this
stuff but you do have to make sure you
give it a a good shake before you use it
otherwise you get kind of particles on
your face but other than that I'm
obsessed of this product but now this is
the finished look so this was the
finished makeup look I really hope you
