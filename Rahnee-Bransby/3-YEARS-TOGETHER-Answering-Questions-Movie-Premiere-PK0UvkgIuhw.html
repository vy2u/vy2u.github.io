I'm doing another vlog this week and
literally
well what's going on here I was like
what am i doing but I was accidentally
zooming in on my face I'm actually
obsessed as well at the moment I love
doing them I love editing them so I
start on getting Sikhism but today it is
minor Braden three year anniversary it
has come around so far like three years
is such a long time it is actually like
my blowing as if it's been four years
but we aren't really doing anything
special to celebrate say because we have
a movie premiere tonight for fifty
shades darker and also I have a few
things to do you guys also going to meet
my dad and my dad is like my favorite
person in the world so I'm so excited
for you guys to see what it's like I was
taught way too far so yeah I just had
some breakfast and it did my makeup I'm
about to go get changed and I have to go
get my mold check with my dad I have a
lot of moles all over my body and I've
been putting it off for the longest time
so I thought it was about time to repost
them sorry and go get them checked out
yeah let's leave lj6 and
hope you enjoy so because it is Alfre
anniversary today we thought that we
would ask you guys to ask us some
questions and we would ask employees so
I look at both wearing out there so the
first question is what is our favorite
festival to go through as you probably
know we're going through every single
festival Under the Sun because we're
addicted so what's your favorite um
probably the laneway I would say my
favorite is probably GTM but we're
actually going to splendor in the grass
appeal so I think that'll probably be
our favorite well a question is the
create a field bomb-ass Instagram photos
and every single photo that Braden isn't
in is taken by him so you'd like the
typical like Instagram husband or
Instagram boyfriend so the next question
is are you both interested in fashion as
each other recently his fashion has
changed like a lot wiser joy why is that
I'll talk about this on camera why she's
been through Satan's here but recently I
have seen a dramatic change in brain is
fashion and I think it it I really do
like it now she's got you though having
clothes me yeah well I tried to mess it
here on Facebook and she had apply the
photons gave it good the second time and
then she replied and um when I started
writing I was like the most Awkward
person ever because I had like relaxed
anxiety and it was so funny I don't love
going to his house and I literally we
are not feel like maybe the whole day
and I said like three words table this
is like my better size you last Mother's
of the other one so it's mine sitting in
the ugly side yes well I don't know
thank you that time that really changed
you know
okay what should I wear every we have my
what is one thing that we drew that
annoys each other the most everything
and the messiest person like
it's actually reduced the messiest
person event my whole life by a long
shot
I'm not even messy I'm actually like
sorry clean I'm like OCD with cleaning
the only thing I'm mostly with is
bedroom
so anything I can't keep clean
everything else perfect when I'm like in
a bad read or something always like
trying to make me angry I get so good
I'm going to get please stop being
annoying now like you really annoy me
and he keeps going
he just keeps antagonizing me it is so
annoying like he loves making me angry
sorry too what do we fund is a freighter
was driving my car and I chose a bit of
glass on the road that I had known
because I drove past it before and I was
like go around the glove and he didn't
really got around this hopefully and
then he went to take off and my wheels
kind of like you know when you take off
boss and your wheels like spit out my
spun out and I got so angry at him I
can't believe you would drink that I
just like had a massive argument because
he's on my wheels of it I'm gonna tone
man I gotta see yesterday so it's that
time of the month
and he was just doing it up like please
right I'm going through that and I woke
up how angry and I'm turning around and
like piss ourselves laughing good one is
uh you have any favorite music tell them
she likes Rufus no idea any games and
that's it you like three goddess the
greater things I enjoyed like music
because I like lots of little different
bit for me I think I don't have one
favorite genre so I think about 93 that
or rusev Oh taught me it or recess so
it's great and find it weird that I get
recognized in public not anymore
like no right is the one that was
something okay so we decide the photo
and don't do that yes
we always like to attack you but I think
bran loves it as well because it's kind
of like you get to meet new people have
a chat and my brother
hello genuine response for that one so
the next question is different to the
one we just absolute but what is the
most annoying thing you notice about
each other when she aids it just sounds
like this
hey and then you go lipstick on what's
wrong with that
mm-hmm and then also I'm stop feeling
like a beer or starts honest I think
sorry my camera just died but what we
were saying is every time I start to
film a vlog or stop some snapchat I
always clean my fur and I go Duty like
50,000 times but every time me and
Braden are going out he will put a shed
on and it would be perfectly fine like
iron and hung up and he goes using this
nice ironing and we're already running
late I'm like no it's fine you guys and
I'm gonna go diamond yes time it doesn't
even need to be I'm going to get on it
and it just reminded me of the most
annoying thing he does he's one of those
people that sits on their flooring and
they can't multitask so he'll be on his
phone like typing away and I'll ask him
something and he'll be like sorry well
I'm like seriously I'll just wait you
will see a full question that's video
right and he goes to my right and a
little bit more because he doesn't
really talk to my gloves
yeah yeah sorry I'm just going to help
my gut now because I opened to drive
today is that I'm going to get my gut
now because we are
we have to get apples yes I probably
already said that in the vlog I
literally cannot remember I have a web
camera I was in my dog given a and I'll
bring a pulp that was backless sorry I
have a lot of moles on my bagging you
can see all the moles on my back I'm at
that good oh my god another class what
of like driving at the time as well I
freaked out and also what and he'll say
your moles on your back of clothes are
that is so bad and I'll spring out I'm
going to show you I was going to get
something but yet so we decided that it
would be safe to go get them checked out
because I haven't had them checked out
since I was probably if I definitely
recommend getting them checked out
because you would because you always
want to be safe than sorry
my biggest video was always getting my
most checked out and something being
wrong that's why I put it off for so
long but today's the day always so this
is my dad and Lenny say hi hello tell
everyone a little bit about yourself
oh wow I work in sales I sell beer for a
living if any use guys want to come to
one of my tastings you get insight into

actually going to sell right out free on
