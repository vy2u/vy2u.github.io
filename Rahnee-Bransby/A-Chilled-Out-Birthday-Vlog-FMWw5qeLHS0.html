because it is my 19th birthday for all
of you that didn't Ori I am only 19
years old I feel like I'm one of you

but just my love it is pouring with rain
here in Australia and it looks like a
huge storm is about to hit w weather is
horrible here in its earlier today I am
actually a summer baby so I was born
like smack bang in the middle of summer
but every single year without fail it
pause with rain on my birthday and like
a huge storm here lastly on my 18th

storms in Perth vicia it is pouring with
rain it is black skies and just my luck
yesterday it was literally 40 degrees
and I was dying of heat and now it's
literally disgusting I hate this or that

beers I don't think it's going to get
clear anytime soon so I have no idea
what I'm going to do today but I just
quickly got ready for the day threw on
some makeup and I'm going to lapse
breakfast with Braden and then
unfortunately Braden got caught into
work so he's working 12 to 5 I think so
then he's going to go to work I am
seeing a friend and then I don't know
what I'm going to do for the rest of the
day I might go to the gym because I
didn't purchase the gym at yesterday
and I also might vlog some of that as
well and if you guys want to see a
little workout routine or something let
me know because I'll do one of those
