back to my channel so today I thought
our vlog because I go to prison tomorrow
so I thought I'd loves me like packing
and to be honest I just feel like
blogging today I'm not too sure why I'm
really really sick hence the boys and I
just can't get rid of this sickness it
is honestly driving me crazy I've been
really black with YouTube and I just
want to get back into it but I'm so sick
so I thought the best thing to do would
be to film a vlog so today I'm just
getting lunch with a friend and I also
have to pack because I wrote a bristan
tomorrow to see the Brisbane crew and
I'm so freaking excited it feels like
it's been so long since I've seen them
so I'm so ready
also I picked up a bunch of clothes from
a sports girl so I thought I would you
like a little sports girl I'm all in
this video I feel like it would be
something a little bit fun and different
because instead of doing like a full-on
dedicated haul I can do a whole and also
show you guys when I get up to today
so that's that I thought you guys here
to do the intro because my room is such
a mess like it's my really messes on the
past like two weeks and it's actually
disgusting like I will clean it like
completely and then within like 10
seconds of Smith again so yeah that's
the problem so I thought I would start
the vlog by showing you guys everything
that I got from Sportsgirl
I'm actually working with it sports are
on this video show you guys like the
Neal's shirts so they haven't dropped
and they are all so freakin cute and so
cool the styles are like so different
and they're very based around ruffles
which i think is so accused as a big
fella and it's definitely my favorite
because I feel like it's very me it's
very different and I really like how it
cinches in your way so it looks like you
have a really little ways but I've also
had this chart with these really cool
flared pants which like red white and
black I think they're supportive and
this outfit is just so cool the next
time I have this one is so freaking cool
because I love the ruffles on the
sleeves I never seen a shop like this
before so it is so so cool it is
definitely something a little bit
different but I love how to turn it is
this is the next one it is so freaking
cool because it reminds me
like a boyfriend but not paid I love
this place how they going to that little
calf I think that is so pretty cool
so this is the next top it's the same
with like two big ruffle sleeves which i
think is so cute
is one actually has straps here which
you can put over your shoulders but I
like the look of it tucked in this top
is so flattering on even though it is
like really roughly and big it gives you
the shape up sure on the chest
ignore the blotchiness when I touch my
chest too much it goes really blotchy
but I've also paired it with some
jewelry from floor scale so what go
actually has the best freaking jewelry
in the whole wide world sorry I've had
it with this really cute trying to start
which I'm actually obsessed with and
these really cute like crescent moon
earrings which I freaking love when I
saw this I wasn't sure if I'd like it
but once it's on it is so cool I've
added a little spin on this top because
I've actually tied it up and I think
that is really really cool
I'll sorry a little bit resin but I
paired it with these like glittery high
waisted flat pairs I love color blocking
my outfits and I think it just makes
that it's like really rather than cool
anyway that is all the shots that I have
to share with you guys today you enjoy
seeing these like mini holes
definitely let me know because I would
do more in light love from stuff and I
think it's such a good idea if I have
like a few things to show you guys just
to throw into a vlog been through like a
dedicated video but yeah I'll leave a
link below if you want to purchase any
of these shirts from sport girl my
favorite one is probably be first when I
showed you which is like the one with
the cinched in waist I think it is so
different and it reminds me of a pirate
so I don't know why I think that's why I
love it so much
whether it is sorta rific it is so dark
so I'm so excited to get out of pub
tomorrow and go to Brisbane to the sunny
Sunshine Coast
I'm not even going to the Sunshine Coast
but hey we'll deal with that but now I'm
just going to get ready and go out and
grab some lunch with a friend and then
come back and pack so you guys can help
me pack again
just behind the Saints of Ronnie's is
campy Boston more me I mean we
definitely have like the same taste in
fashion yet I think I live around less
sorry
sigh Regis women had lunch and did a bit
of shopping and Lea just took some
Instagram photos for me so now I'm going
back home to pack because I go to
Brisbane tomorrow morning and yeah ha ha
why is this keep happening it was so
funny as Leo's daughter because he was
like crying and Lucas what's wrong Baba
I would pluck one chicken I like to fill
right now pathology assistant ID
sorry it is now six o'clock at night and
I just got home I'm laying next to a
basket of washing now I have to pack
because I fly out it like six o'clock in
the morning so yeah I honestly look so
crazy right now like why - sorry I'm
almost done packing now so I'm just
going to get the last few things
together that I need my voice is that
completely gone now when it gets to like
night time I lose my voice and it's
really random if they like that ever
since I was little I don't know why I'm
going to go for a shout out because it
was like 10 p.m. and I need to get this
off I need to go to sleep get some rest
so I can wake up early so every morning
I know this look was shortened to cool
