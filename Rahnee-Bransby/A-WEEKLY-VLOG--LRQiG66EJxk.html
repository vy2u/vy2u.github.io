back to my channel so this week I
decided to film another weekly vlog I
feel like I haven't actually logged in
so long but I think it's only been like
three weeks but it feels like ages sorry
I thought I saw another weekly vlog my
last one did so well and you guys loved
it so why not so right now it is 8
o'clock on a Monday morning and I'm
about going to the gym and then I have
to go drill through shot so I'm going to
take you guys I'm going to start off my
morning with a little bit of Justin
Bieber because I'm freaking a museum
gosh this is like my favorite
now that I'm done at the gym I feel a
bit of it for you and if you guys want
me to film more of what I do at the gym
so you guys can get like a little
insight of what I do then let me know
because I'll be sure to keep doing that
I just hate filming when I'm alone today
I was with a friend so when she films
for me I feel totally fine but when I'm
alone it's a little bit more awkward so
now I'm just going to go do some screen
shopping because I've been eating so bad
lately it's actually disgusting so I
need to get some healthy food and then
I'm going to film two videos for the
rest of the day so yeah it what else I
got less but it's actually closed it off
and it's a hot one we need sorry I just
finished early nearly across I hate
video and look at this comfortable oh my
god the console is so that I can't even
do like this video is actually so much
fun to film so by the time this book
will be out that video already be out so
I might have a decide but what I was
saying is this look if you want to know
how to get it will be up on my channel
already I leave a link below if you
haven't seen it yeah I lipstick feels
disgusting and my skin and foundation so
gross so I'm going to go to itself now
and go eat some food so I'm just about
to put in my room it is pretty trashed
right now but I just got a package I
want to show you guys my room is
literally a word messy so I just
received a package from naked and it's
got all these umm pieces in it and
they're actually focal entry so this is
my favorite it's a bright orange jump
off this one is so nice but it says the
future equals female so I've got all
these different pieces this jumper is
the exact same but it's in black and
yellow I just thought the orange one it
is sort of groovy I can't wait to take
an outfit for you with this and this one
is one of my favorites as well I love
how simple it is I think is awesome
there's these really cool trackers as
well they are so freakin soft inside
I love them I think they're so cool and
the orange run I just can't get enough
like how cool is that
oh my god I would like us to do this
body God or something right now so right
now and just off highway to my best
friend's house today we actually were
going to go see one of our other best
friends ash she just had a baby but
she's not feeling too good today sorry I
Jordan Erick was going to go see or any
more we're going to see how she's
feeling I had a copy yesterday afternoon
and it was the out of my tastebuds
like have you guys ever had that you
drank something really really hot or
eating really really hard at your
Facebook like my taste buds I just saw I
don't know is I just what Pleasant not
even there so I also bought overnight
today I thought it was about time
officer about to you to finally buy one
because I filmed the video yesterday and
literally like I got a something
literally shiny and Michael what are you
doing to me and what is this troubling
because I've always thought the lighting
in my videos was really off like the
contrast and it's the contrasted scores
and it's really really yellow but I
thought it was finally time to buy one
today because I filmed the video
yesterday and it just grossed me out
like the lighting just made me so sleep
I really didn't like it we're finally
stepping up my game and making my
channel look a little bit more
professional and charming relax
aren't you but I know they're so worth
it so I'm excited for it to come I mean
you can look back sorry I just got home
and I'm about to make some lunch
but before I do that I just want to
quickly talk to you guys for a second if
you are an adult and you get bills
please for the love of God make sure you
pay them when you're supposed to because
I would be all for my car the
registration so I have to pay my car
registration so it was like valid on the
word and that I could drive it and stuff
and I was a thing so swollen and I
didn't want to pay the amount supposed
to pay so I just ignored it for about
five months and then I got
build on some of that which was a fine
for not paying the registration and
re-register ating my car so I just
wanted paid that feel and I like to
registrate my car and I didn't realize
that if you don't do it in the time that
supposed to do it you get a fine and
passing house we take it through the pit
so that pretty much means you just have
to go take it to get it looked at and
they can pick you up on anything that is
wrong with the car and anything that
needs to be fixed with it and then you
end up for spending so much money so I
took it to the armpits to go get it
looked at today so the registration
originally was like three or four
hundred dollars so um on top of that
I've already paid one hundred dollars
which was the one hundred dollar fine
and then I have to pay for - I don't
know what they call about two things
that allows you to drive the car because
it's unregistered so it's those three
together of like $60 and then on top of
that I have to pay to get my car
actually looked at so that was another
$90 on top of that and I just got to
call them to say that my two front tires
need to be changed because they're kind
of boarding a little bit so two new
tires until that is probably like five
or six hundred dollars so yeah it could
have cost me four hundred I'll open up
cooking like a grand so if you do get
bills please pay them I knew suppose
through this with my lesson plan because
I would never ever be spelling and not
pay a bill ever again I think I forget
that I'm like another now so that if I
don't through what I'm supposed to do I
get a dull cut out all consequences
so yeah just my luck I'm now walking out
so much money freaking make my color
drivable and there's nothing wrong with
my car anyway it's just my two front
tires I need new ones so it would still
cost me so much more when I could have
just paid the four hundred dollars then
and honestly I have no one else to blame
but myself pat on the back Ronnie
good job I'm in my element because I can
see a rainbow little of something skies
well talk about to pour down Braden has
Levine in one of my videos for a very
long time
hello hello hi going today look with the
double rainbow all the way awakened
because I saw a rainbow so Braden and I
we just talking about our day before and
I told him a story and we actually lost
it because this explains me perfectly as
a human so as you guys know yesterday I
went through shopping and and there was
like a full watermelon like you know
that really big like full watermelons
anyway is that two dollars for a kilo
and I was like holy $2 for a huge
watermelon this is amazing this is so
cheap so I bought it so I was at the
checkout and the watermelon scans and it
scan for $20 and I just freaked out and
I didn't know what to do so I bought a
watermelon quick $20
I meant who else is like yes or no have
you seen that video that Justin printed
on Instagram and he was like dude if I
was a turtle I'd use my shell of
surfboard and I'd ride those face do you
wanna know why cuz I'm gnarly how
obviously it is - oh so it is Wednesday
today in Ohio guys literally just seen
editing all day and just lounging around
and doing nothing but I just one scoop
Mustafa Tokyo it's like 12 o'clock I
think it's like lunchtime but anyway we
just walk downstairs and we can say
something to our door and we thought
that there was a huge party playing
there so we walk outside and this is
what was at the door
so these freaking that beautiful flowers
were sitting out the door and I have no
idea who they're from but they are
incredible so I'm about sites and card
and see what my heart is literally
beating like 10 miles an hour because
they're just so beautiful this has never
happened to me before and I'm very
excited to leave the most beautiful
flowers I've ever seen and I've got like
a little candle touch to them but ah I'm
so full like flashing and when stuff
like this happens I don't know how to
react because it's like makes me so
happy so I'm like okay I'm going to I've
