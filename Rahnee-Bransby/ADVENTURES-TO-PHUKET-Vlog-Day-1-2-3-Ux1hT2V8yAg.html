my concerts
missing to fly we're on our to pick a
sweat all my makeup off and my hair is
going crazy but we are finally in Phuket
out to so much drama and craziness ' so
I'm going to show you guys the first
Villa we're staying in because this is
insane
so I'm going to show you a racetrack so
here's our door walking in we have our
kitchen that's kitchen there and then
over here is our lounge room that
freakin massive large I can fit like
40,000 people and then walking out of
the laundry is our bedroom
and then behind our bedroom is our
bathroom so this is what it looks like
the massive tub that I'm going to dip
into very soon and then the toilets huge
shower which I'm so excited for I've had
my son of like 24 hours and it's a
two-hour express Wang outside this is a
pool and I love you and so excited to
see like the sunset and sunrise because
it is just going to be absolutely
amazing hi guys sorry it's out first
right here in Phuket and we just woke up
and got ready for the day we are going
to go get breakfast now and take a
little walk around the resort and see
everything because from what we've seen
this place looks amazing that the place
we're staying at is tree Pamela yeah
this place is seriously
sorry it is not a p.m. Braden is
actually asleep at the moment because
he's not feeling too good I think he
might have been something that's not
right not from here but I think from the
kale Airport he had a burg I just don't
think it went down right but he's not
feeling too well at the moment so it's
just having a bit of a sleep and we
aren't doing anything for dinner I think
we're just going to order room service
today we just lounge by the pool and
went out for lunch and breakfast as well
we didn't do much today because I still
a bit tired from traveling so we just
decided to have a relaxing day also our
resort isn't very close to the main
strip so we didn't want to catch a taxi
because it's quite far so we just wanted
to chill at the resort my natural hair
is starting to appear um they have
strainer actually doesn't work here
because I think it's like two high
voltage or something everything else
works but when we plug that in when I
thought that in it just doesn't work for
some reason yeah I hope you enjoyed day
one and I will see you tomorrow
so Braden has finally woken up so we
have just ordered room service we've got
a tiger and Korey and a pad thai and now
we're just going to nibble on these good
morning everyone
so it is day 2 here in Phuket and today
it is our last day in this resort and in
about an hour and a half we check out
and we go to our next place which is
parisa I'm so excited for that place
looks amazing as well but this place has
been like literally a dream come true it
is seriously so beautiful here the staff
is amazing the food is amazing we just
had such an amazing time I've had to
chop my hair up because I'm just
like crazy yeah we're just going to get
breakfast now and then I'll shut up you
guys
nah I especially Medusa for just 2 G so
we just packed up our suitcase and now
we're saying goodbye to this villa this
has been seriously amazing I don't know
how many times I said that but I just
quickly give you guys like one more over
here because I'm going to miss this it's
so beautiful I literally got so used to
living here but yeah and then one quick
last view outside
and now we're off to our next villa
let's go so we just got to our second
resort this resort is called parisa and
I'm going to give you guys a room tour
because this is insane the front door
where you walk in and this is just a
panning of our way this little cart here
which has a bit of fruit on there for us
to eat and then walking over here is our
view which is so crazy I'll show you
guys so this is a little balcony area we
have a pool here and then we have two
tanning beds and two chairs and then
there's
the incredible view
so then walking back inside we have our
bed which is so big so excited sleeping
next I'm so tired and we just have a TV
then walking through here is our
bathroom so there's a little vanity and
mirror here this is Braden's one as you
can see it says for him mirror and then
on this side there's another mirror and
like a wardrobe and another vanity this
is for house so this is my one and then
walking through here we have the toilets
outside next to the toilet and then
there's a shower
then we have this bathtub which the
beautiful is insane like I'm so excited
for this part right now a little boogie
and then out here which I haven't
actually seen yet is out here is the
outdoor shower oh my goodness
which leads
so crazy so we just had a little dip in
the pool and now we're going to go get
lunch
I'm very saving right now I'm so sorry
if the quality changes from like amazing
to really bad or like not as good
because my camera keeps doing this
within keeps cutting me off like every
10 seconds sometimes it'll last a bit
longer but sometimes it'll cut off I
have no idea what but I have no idea why
but it is driving me in bloody sane but
now we're just going to get lunch so
yeah also I just realized someone has
not made an appearance in the blog yet
we're just out of typeset in and out at
our resort presa and the V is insane I'm
gonna have to turn around and show you
guys so when all the meals come out I'll
definitely show you guys because I think
they're going to be pretty good you
excited so here is the view
unfortunately the sunset isn't going to
be seen because it design is hidden
behind the clouds but that is totally
okay because I am so happy with this
view it is actually incredible like what
oh you look so this is our entree we
have like a chicken noodle salad I think
I think it's just like a noodle salad
with chicken on top and then spring
rolls we haven't eaten all day so we are
very excited for this
so use our last day here in this resort
which is hurry so we just went down for
breakfast and we just got back and we
have the buffy breakfast down there and
I just filmed a video for you guys which
would hopefully be up on Thursday I'm
hoping I get it up before I fly for him
so now we're just packing everything up
and we're going to check out I'm totally
as I said with the last place I'm going
to miss this view so much as I said with
the last place I'm going to miss this
views very much like this is actually
incredible I was saying to Brayden
before how whenever I looked out there
it hurts my eyes because it just doesn't
feel real like it just feels like
everything like at a postcard or
something it is seriously incredible
this place is to die for
so yesterday we went and got a massage
which was so good I haven't had a
massage like that in ages but it was
actually so hard like at one point I was
like trying not to laugh cuz it hurt so
much but other than that I was amazing
we also went to a TAS at dinner which I
think I told you guys last night and we
were so full like this morning we didn't
even eat much breakfast because we have
so much but this place is seriously like
incredible I'd never seen something like
this in my life like oh my god it is
just like I don't know it's just like
it's speechless like I really don't know
what to say about it because I feel like
every other word I view is like amazing
incredible speechless but it's just like
beyond words this place is crazy so as I
said by going down in about half an hour
to go check out and go to our next place
so I think I'm going to end the vlog
