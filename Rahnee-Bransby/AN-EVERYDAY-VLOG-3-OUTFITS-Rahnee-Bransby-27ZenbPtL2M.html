my channel so today I thought I'd look
for you guys because it has been a long
time since I've loved today I'm just
going for breakfast and I'm also going
to the beach and I'm also going out for
drinks with friends later tonight so it
would just be fun stuff like that and
I'm also actually looking at flights to
Europe this year with it two of my
friends so I'm really excited for that
well sorry I'm really excited to say
that this log is sponsored by Benefit
Cosmetics and a glue store I've teamed
up with them to show you three outfits
during the day and also some makeup
looks as well these are just some of the
pieces that I'll be wearing today they
have such awesome stuff and I'm really
excited to show you guys the outfits
that I have plans not everything is on
the rack because I'm wearing some of the
pieces right now but you'll see
everything that I wear throughout the
video I will also have all the makeup
and clothing pieces that I share with
you guys in this video links below so be
sure to check out any of the links if
you see anything you like and yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed this little
vlog and let's just jump straight into
it sorry I think eyes can see I've
already done my base I have a really bad
morning voice at the moment so that's
why my voice is like crazy creaky I'm
just going to do like my everyday makeup
look and I'm going to finish off using
some of my favorite benefit products
because if there's one brand that I'd
have to use for the rest of my life it's
probably benefit I love their products
they're just like literally amazing so
I'm just going to add some color back
into my face using it the hoola benefit
bronzer this is honestly my favorite
bronzer ever but I'm going to use it not
to contour just to bronze up the face
and I'm also going to contour the nose
with this
now I'm just going ahead with the
California blush and I'm going to apply
this to my cheeks this is a by far my
favorite blush in the whole wide world I
literally use it every single day and my
who actually got me obsessed with it
again because he used it on me at the
master coughs no that's just oh my god
it literally smells like heaven I'm just
going to be taking the what's up
highlighter to highlight my face and now
this is a cream highlight but I do like
to put this on top of powder everyone's
different I just don't mind how it looks
on top of powder so I'm just going to
let me go ahead and highlight the high
points on my face now I'm just going to
go ahead and filling my brows it would
be precisely at my brow pencil this is
one of the best for a prints her show
show this is one of the best brow
pencils on the market like I don't know
one person that doesn't like it and just
set the brows I'm just taking the
24-hour browser
and I'm going to be using the brandy bad
girl bang mascara oh my god you guys
this is honestly one of the best and
scars I've ever used in my life and I
will show you why I am so glad but if it
came out with this product because
so this is the before and after so this
is my lashes after one coat of the
mascara it's honestly like ridiculous
that I don't understand how a mascara
does this and then this it's pretty much
all I do for makeup on a day-to-day
basis just my base and my mascara and
yeah so let's get on with the day I'm
going to breakfast now to my favorite
cafes so I'll take you guys along sorry
I just got into your breakfast I'm going
to your jaw straight quarters of course
I don't know my blogging Michael is up
yeah but if it is or if it isn't you
know that Joe Circle is is my favorite
cafe in Perth they do the bestest eyes
ever so yeah we're going to go eat and
then we're going to the beach because
it's such a nice day today
I literally love my life
the ladies hands that put out fries down
fully miss my mouth and went that way
and I'm like wow
so now we're just going to go home and
get changed and going to the beach
because as I said it's such a nice day
this morning it was actually like really
stole me and I was like wow that's
amazing
but it's cleared up now it's getting
quiet so good shadow so we just got to
the beach and we found this and then
okay actually really cool this is a
usual Beach hike going to but we came
here yesterday and it was really cool
for like photos myself of course sorry
I'm yeah we came here today again and
like no one comes here as well so it's
pretty cool but it's really windy out it
hasn't been perfect like I'm fairly sure
I could be a false fact because it is so
windy today it's black hole so if we do
choose the best day to come to the beach
going through what I do best and take
that it this is my second outfit of the
day I thought I'd get changed because
it's more beachy I never wear button but
I kind of like how this is more open and
I got a fresh pair of cotton I haven't
got like the regular phone
I'm just going to quickly go for him a
touch up my makeup because whoa little
bit rude and then I'm going to my friend
everybody's house because my friend my
friends Jack evany and I are going to
Europe so we're going to go sort out the
flat and the itinerary I'm just going to
do a quick little card touch up before I
go through marry other two friends if
that's true things that I always touch
up its my blush and my lipstick I don't
know why I always touch up my blush I
just
so of course I'm just going to use my
California blush and use my rearview
mirror to do so
but for my lips I'm going to put some
lipstick on because I didn't put any on
this morning this is the their rule
double the lip lipsticks so the really
cool thing about these is it's a
lipstick and a lip liner this color is
so nice this is in the shade nude
scandal I wear this a lot actually I
really like it oh it smells so good
and not is the coop so this is who
you're going to see for six-week summer
in Europe hi blog you guys excited
welcome to Europe welcome excited oh my
god like tickly thanks I'm good love you

just raised her to get ready because as
I mentioned in the intro that was rude I
mentioned in the intro I am going out
for drinks and dinner with some friends
tonight so sorry I'm just going to take
it some of the benefit hoola bronzer and
bronze up my face a little bit more and
make it a little bit more dramatic
because it is a nighttime look and I'm
going in with the Watts up highlighter
and I'm going to add this to my face
just to make myself Gloria a little bit
more
I'm going to take the they're real
push-up liner and I'm going to add a
small wing to my top lash line just to
make my eyes look a little bit more
dramatic and to finish up this look I'm
going to take the of everyone's double
the lip lipstick in the shade at lusty
Rose this is more of like a rosy shade
and I'm going to apply this to my lips
and then that is the finished nighttime
look or like how I like to touch up my
makeup from daytime to nighttime to make
it a little bit more muddy and fresh yes

hair and put my outfit on and I'll see
