back to my channel so today I'm coming
back at show with another try on
clothing haul don't need to explain
myself you guys know how much I love
these I know how much you guys love them
so we're just going to jump straight
into it today I'm going to spice it up
and do things a little bit differently
today so I think I'm going to start
accessories shoes and then clothes so
starting with accessories I have chosen
to show you guys so if you find self up
to brand new watches because I love the
look of watches I decide they're make
you look so classy really feel like they
pull a whole look together so I picked
up these two watches from this by the
way before I show you guys a lot much as
I got when we talk about its packaging
like this is so sleek and so cool I love
it I love packaging that house like that
matte finish and then like the logo is
kind of like shiny design sense I think
it looks really expensive and luxury and
I love how the little logos on the side
and then when you open it up it looks
like this inside so these other two
watches here I don't even have to say it
because I know you guys will never ever
change the color of this band is
freaking stunning as you guys probably
know if you watch my videos all the time
this color is my favorite color in the
world I always get my nails this color I
just think it is so gorgeous so this
just has a really cute pinky Brown band
with rose gold detailing and a Wyatt
face this is so pretty nice what the
hell the thing I love about these
watches is the face isn't too big
because if you have a tiny wrist like me
you would know the struggles of try and
buying a watch face that fits your wrist
properly they are so comfortable and so
nice to wear and so well fitting as well
now that I try this one on actually
gonna wear this one a lot more than the
black pine because sisters actually so
nice another really awesome thing about
these lunches is the band's are actually
removable so you can buy different
colored bands and put them on with a
different face of the work so with this
which I also got a light ban so ever
that I'm really excited to wear the
right then because nothing looks nicer
than like a white watch was like a
really dark fake tan I love it freedom
is actually a stuffed with this when I
wear it from the day he gets angry
even complete like can't wear that what
I'm like sorry I am so it is this is all
black watch here I find this so sleek
and so sexy I don't know there's
something about it that I look at and I
go oh that part I just love how simple
this is I feel like there's so much
everything just because it is all black
and it would look so cool with an
all-black outfit or an all-white out
there like monochrome I will leave a
link down below so you can purchase
those if you are interested out looking
at any of them I fricking love them and
also it is not a running haul if I don't
put you guys up with a rocking discount
so that's where I will leave I just
can't prove that for those watches that
will save you time settle on the screen
and also down below so check it out I
just want to quickly show you guys
mm shoes that I think that oh my god you
are honestly going to pass the hell out
these shoes are on a sleeve or my
favorite pairs that I've ever owned and
I have a woman yet because I'm saving
them for a special occasion so these are
very fun friend Elias me I really hope
I'm not deterring that it is the first
pair so these are just a really table
gray kind of off-white until they have
an open side which i think is so pretty
and they also have an earthen heel which
i think is so cool they kind of like a
brute style tool which I love and I love
I love how the bottom of the fuel and
fishel itself is matte black I'm going
to event on Friday which I'm pretty sure
I'm going to wear this too because
they're just stunning and the next pair
I picked up would you believe are you
guys in my expressions booth but it came
to my realization the other day as well
that I don't actually own any ground
booth so I decided to beef up this
absolutely stunning pair of brown breeze
means I like the perfect brown food I
love the brown kind of like an idiot and
darks coming Brown I think these would
look so awesome with a pair of ripped
jeans and I love how you can totally
dress this up and dress them down I just
accepted them how nice is a and how much
is the brown a little bit all the
clothing pieces I picked up first place
I pick W pieces is at princess Polly you
guys know I love princess Polly so the
best thing I got is with this really
simple black singlet
I love how thin the straps Aramis I
think they are so pretty and so sweet
cereal of this is so soft and so comfy I
think this would look sorcerer awesome
for that I went to tear of like silk
dress pants and run up a pair
to stop addresses down and it is just so
coffee and I just love it I love how
simple it is
speaking of simple of the next tik-tok
is with playing life and basics here now
I have actually been living in this for
the past like two weeks and what I mean
living I mean living if you go back to
like all my recent ones I've been
wearing this top it is so lightweight
and so soft and literally I've even
slept in it and it is so comfy I think
this is like the perfect black basic tee
that this looks so good with a pair of
denim jeans or a pair of denim shorts
kind of like having the front on soon
and you can never be wrong with a basic
tee like never ever ever and the next
time I pick up is this a very pinky here
and this helped acutest quote on it it
says whether love tenfold now this is
actually a make pink and Disney
collaboration and prediction is from
speeding the beads I may be wrong I do
wish I got this in a size bigger because
it is a little bit small but it is still
wearable I just fell in love with this
because verses are my favorite flowers
ever I'm obsessive relative and I saw
the core it was the cutest thing ever
the next help I think that would you
guys has roses on it I love the style of
this I think it is so so cool I also
love how to sleep I'll have blank and
also buttons up and hope I can really
cute peplum at the bottom and I think
this one looks or Sokol with a black
denim skirt or something like that and
other piece of clothing that I've been
living in and if you watch on gloves
fewer females as well we will just be
perfect blue pair of denim shirt we've
done shot the slopes our feet they are
such a nice bit of such a nice color and
I love how there's not too much going on
they just have this really cool like
frame at the bottom of them so you go
with literally everything and they're so
comfortable if you want to have it Paris
and I'm sure these other pair you want
any love clothing item I should start
from Christmas Kali are these light wash
blue denim jeans now these are such a
nice suit I just love how these look on
and I love how to go these tiny little
roots in the knees so there's not too
much rips going on it's just really
simple I only like how the butter fits
right a little bit I feel like you can
never go wrong with jeans
I know Jesus I would have 14,000 terms
well so it once again I have it too can
trick you guys from princess Holly I'll
leave it on the screen and links below
as well moving on I picked up two pieces
from ASA by the way I get so many
questions asking one
our online shop is and it is probably
hands down a cell site they just have
everything for everyone and I just love
them so I was looking on a so slightly
perfect Jennifer because I actually
don't own a blue denim skirt but my luck
I just applied a blue denim skirt but I
did come across this white dansker which
I loved but this is just a white denim
skirt and it's got brown threading all
around it which i think is so cool any
bottom is also really really afraid as
well I love that look I can be destroyed
edgy and so cool and also it was so
affordable as well for a denim skirt I
can do perform like $45 or something the
only thing that annoys me about it which
I will say is when you do it up it is
actually buttons all the way down
not a zip and then a button I really
don't like when skirts or shorts have
buttons all the way down because I find
it so uncomfortable and it also makes
you look like you have a willy
so that is not cute and the last thing I
think that from ASOS is this yellow
basic tee which says great personality
on the front I love really basic to use
that just like have a sentence on them I
think they are so cool and I love how
this with yellow I don't need you guys
can tell by my Instagram lately but I've
been loving the colors yellow and orange
at the moment sorry I think this is so
cool
moving on as you start to pieces from an
online boutique called
Remi lanes now this is actually a
perfect designer and her stuff is so
cute it's those by Rory and I just love
it the first piece I got I had so many
questions about and so many people
asking where it's from this is really
really gorgeous peachy yellow cotton
dress I don't how the Batsuit really
really low it's a lightweight material
and so comfy it's like the perfect throw
on and go out the door dress and I think
it goes really well with my skin tone as
well
if you watch my love the whole video I
was actually wearing this in it but I
think it's or not every last piece I
picked up is this really really adorable
crocheted halter top now this gives me
such at 75 I think this would look so
awesome with a pair of like corduroy
pants or something like that
it's that looks really pretty tassel
detailing down the side it also has this
tidy telling down the front as well I
love how this is like fully backwards I
think is very nice and this will look so
cute in summer with like a really jumped
hat and I have a few more things to show
you guys so the last place I got two
items from is general pan general Tanz
is also an australian-based shop and
they have numerous and
amazing things on there they have such
cool fashions they really want to know
for jeans and then and that they stop
here by the rounded sube now these are
actually my new favorite jeans ever they
are be perfect like boyfriend mom jeans
they're just really nice lightly wash
and my favorite thing about these jeans
is the bottom of them they have like
these really awesome rips and like
frizzy telling at the bottom I think
this is so cool and they're so comfy and
so nice they're literally just like
these perfect jeans they are by far my
favorite pair of jeans that I own and
the last clothing item out to show the
guy J is actually this top I'm wearing
at the moment this is by the brain at
smoothie as well I think this is so cool
and so edgy it's just like an off-white
shirt and it's got all these little
holes peeking out the top and the bottom
I think they are so cool I've always
wanted to own a shirt that has like rip
dinner or like hole sticking out of it
I don't start like little pantries on
the group area as well which i think is
so cool I think is such a perfect top
and it goes so well with those things as
well and I just love it it is so comfy
so that is everything that I have to
share with you guys in this haul I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
