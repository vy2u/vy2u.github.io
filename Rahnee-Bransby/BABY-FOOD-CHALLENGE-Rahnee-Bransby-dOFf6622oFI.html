I'm gonna take hi everyone and welcome
back to my channel thank you so much for
watching so today I have a very exciting
video for you guys because I'm joins
with my best friend Shanae so we thought
it would be so much fun to film a
collaboration video together and we were
brainstorming and weren't sure what to
film and then we decided to come up with
the what did we come up with baby food
today we are filming the baby food
challenge and it's pretty
self-explanatory what it is you might
beg for you to try it see if you like it
hit it so I recently saw Sean XO film
this and I think she talked about
getting around 30 is was it done right
yes yep and it looked like so much fun
so we thought yeah I'm going to stop
rambling on and I really hope you guys
enjoy this video and let's go so we just
went to close and picked up five good
and my bad so we picked up five desserts
and five dinners and we got them in a
plastic bag here so we're just gonna
like to do and see what we get really so
let's jump into it
yeah the first one we got was bangers
mash and veggies I pretty sure this is
the first we chose if anyone doesn't
know what bangers is bangers sausages
yeah I know I think you'll be nice if
you want it up I think it's a texture to
be honest it's like it doesn't bother
texture I was right the next one we have
is pumpkin apple and sweet corns and
nothing else
love me some sweet corn babies no time I
make up one two three
he mixes corn an apple am I ever
exaggerating those you know mind that I
don't like that
it tastes I believe but then lot has a
sour sorry out of five I would probably
write that like one and I mean it's bad
enough to give a zero but it's pretty
bad that wasn't it's a desert one it's
banana chop custard yeah I'm kind of
excited cuz I love custard oh my god do
you know what that smells like you know
that banana whoa easy yeah yeah yeah
mmm-hmm give me more I give that a
alright for I'm gonna give that a 5 so
this one is a vanilla custard pasta
tossed on that has a better texture
whether that tastes so good I'll give
that a 3.5
what are therefore I got that up
football I'm giving that a six that was
sorry
sighs every time so this one is banana
pear mango and nothing else
okay kinda suppose that mom oh my god
sorry bet not so not so this line is
peach pear banana and milk off me I'm
never gonna hop in oh my god give that
like minus 5 s when these were supposed
to be nice a name is very arc
oh my god it's stalking my ring oh yeah
suppose to be a dessert one sweet potato
carrot and apple and I don't really like
the idea of apple green in with
vegetables like
I can't remember cheese it sounds like
Oh orange juice
so again I think cool that taste that
thing sweet potato variable yeah it's
not bad
I would give it like a three it's not
too bad yeah and you can taste the
carrot actually okay I was actually so
excited for this one because I loved the
actual meal of this so this is apricot
done it kind of puts me off that they
can blend the meat and put it in these
but yeah it smells young oh my god oh
thanks yeah oh oh my god the second last
one is apple pear and cinnamon I was
kind of let us try this cinnamon in it
but I hate apple pear no here's the
thing I like I like the fruit apples
have strawberry whatever I hate this
summers are not what doesn't have chucks
enough oh that was pretty good nah I'm
sticking with my fault 2.5 so the very
last one we have is possible in AIDS and
we decided to here this one up because
it might taste better it smells good
we're just having this conversation
sample and ace both news Shanae says
bolognaise like I say the G but by I say
bolognaise I'm pretty sure it's bowling
night
or is it silent Volare if you pronounce
Bolognese with bottle ugh maze of the G
or pollinates with the G
silent silent bit meaty I rate this one
