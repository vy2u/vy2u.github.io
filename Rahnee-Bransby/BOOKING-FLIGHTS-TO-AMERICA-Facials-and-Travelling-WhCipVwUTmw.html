channel today I thought I would do a
little weekly vlog because I haven't
done a weekly vlog in a very long time I
have quite a lot planned this week I go
to Melbourne I go to Brisbane I'd
literally be living in planes like for
the past two weeks I've been on like
eight planes in the past three weeks it
is so crazy but right now I'm just I'm
ready to go get a facial so I don't
exactly know what I'm getting yet I
think I might be getting like microderm
or something I'm going to see a girl
that one of my friends go to her
Instagram name I'll put it here it is
just lovely Rachel Diaz I'm pretty sure
I hope I'm not butchering that I've
never had my skin touched by like a
professional before so I'm very excited
to see how this goes down
okay so we're going to do a
microdermabrasion treatment and fruit
enzyme treatment on Ronnie today just to
really clear head pour that and remove
toxins from her system
okay so we've just finished with the
microdermabrasion treatment and we've
popped on an enzyme a free enzyme
treatment with apricot kernel so what
this is going to do is just increase the
circulation of the skin and filtered
toxins from the skin so it's great for
breakouts congested skins blackheads
skins that are just lacking oxygen
ization so I've recommended some
prescribed homecare for Ronnie so to
start with she's going to use the gentle
cleansing gel from ASAP which is an
australian-based cosmeceutical company
so this will just help to balance her
skin of her natural oils without
stripping away her skin barrier it's
anti-inflammatory fills in antioxidants
just to treat the skin you can use it on
your eyes you don't have to use a makeup
remover beforehand either so she'll be
doing this morning and nighttime and
this is this is the advanced hydrating
moisturizer so this just puts hydration
back into the skin and balances the skin
without leaving an oily heavy residue on
the skin it's like feeding nutrients
into the skin my face and my nose
especially is looking a little bit red
but I feel so much better like my skin
just feels amazing it was like I've had
this new layer of skin put on my favor h
'l is honestly it's so beautiful she's
one of the nicest ladies i've ever met
so if you are interested in getting your
skin done and you're from Perth I will
leave all her details on the screen or
down below so definitely go check her
out I highly recommend it
so this is a little bit more of an up
close of my skin and step hi hi this
morning with me I don't really know what
that is but let's just pretend that not
matter because that looks disgusting
