like an everyday night out on the
weekend so let's get into it

primer I'm gonna put that all over my
face

that and then I'm gonna keep putting it
on my face now I'm gonna put the nose
foundation that's gonna go all over my
face
and make it the same color as my body in
nice and brown so I'm gonna use my
Beauty Blender to get that in my face
make it all brown and it's gonna move my
Jesus earrings out of the way get it
blended into my forehead so now I'm just
gonna start using the concealer on my
face I'm gonna put on to my eyes and
under my other eye two triangles and
then down me nose and then on my chin
I'm my brows just blend that in so I can
look concealed
now I'm just gonna take my Ellison Jade
and use the yellow pellet and dab that
into my face onto my eyes and make it
nice and contoured I mean highlighted
I'm just gonna use my Australis powder
and it's gonna do the exact same thing
that once again put it on my face and
just put it all over my face just keep
putting it on my face it's gonna make it
brown now I'm going to contour once
again with the Allyson Jade I'm just
gonna put that on my cheeks make them
look poppin give my cheek some
definition gonna put it on my temples on
the top of my forehead on me little
schnoz and gonna make it look smaller
now I'm gonna go with the bronzer milk
chocolate Soleil and just gonna bronze
my face just make it nice and bronzed
make the whole face bronzed even more
Brown and now for a bit of blush so I'm
gonna go for the pink one we're gonna
make my cheeks look nice and blush like
I've just gotten embarrassed now with
the counter white highlighter we're
gonna make it look like a got a shiny
face make those cheeks look shiny the
Cupid's bow up and down my nose and make
my face look a little bit shiny and then
I'm just gonna put some spray on that
after that we're gonna get our eyebrows
on fleek and just gonna fill them in
because they're not full enough
obviously gonna make them nice and wind
I mean I'll give them a nice shape we're
going in with the Chloe Morello palette
using the orange shared putting it on
top of my eyelids I'm gonna make them
nice and colorful then with the purple
shade I'm gonna use it to put on my
outer V and just blend it in with the
orange shade make it look nice
after I've blended that for a couple
hours gonna go in still going gonna go
in with the after dark spark and use the
pink shade and keep blending just
another color put on top of there make
it shiny make my eyes look nice and
shiny so I'm gonna go back in with the
purple once again gonna put it on the
bottom part of my other this time and
I'm gonna make it look so now my eyes
are gonna start looking nice and smoky
and sexy we're gonna glue the fake
lashes to my eyes to make it look like
I've got some big old eyelashes so I'm
just gonna go ahead and put on the other
eye
otherwise they look weird because you
you need both eyes with the eyelashes on
and then I'm gonna go in with another
shade and put it on the inside of my eye
so it looks like I've got a little bit
of shine in there and so now just gonna
use the melted map to finally finish off
the look on the lips with a bit of a
matte look nice and pink and now my lips

urban decay setting spray gonna set my
face and just make sure that makeup
stays on fleek all day so now we're
