channel thank you so much for watching
so today I decided to film at this
makeup look for you guys it is just like
a really bronze glowy makeup look I
really focused on the face I've done a
harsh contour with a really strong
highlight and just for the eyes I've
just done a really really minimal amount
of mascara LTI lashes mascara so without
further ado let's jump straight into the
video so the first time I'm going to do
is pry my face with the lasting finish
primer by Rimmel London so all I'm doing
is just starting this over my face and
then using my fingers to blend it in
now i'm going to be taking the bolero
FBS to do BB cream this is the mineral
sheer tint Demi Matt one and I'm just
going to be taking a Beauty Blender to
apply this all over my face we're just
working this into my skin with a Beauty
Blender I love this stuff so much
especially in the summer because it
gives the most gorgeous Gloria and
coverage to the skin even though it is a
medium coverage and I'm moving on to the
exciting stuff I'm going to be
concealing and also highlighting with
the maybelline fit me New York concealer
in the shade light oh sorry this is in
the Sheikh Fehr so I'm going to be
applying this on to my eyes to conceal
the dark circles as well as highlight
down the bridge of my nose a little bit
on my forehead on my chin and the
tiniest little bit on my Cupid's bow
look keep it Cupid's bow and blending
that in with a beauty blender
now taking the AC on to a contour care
I'm going to be taking these two shades
here just to set all the places where I
applied the highlights are all the
consumer and to do so i'm going to be
taking a Real Techniques contour brush
now going ahead and studying the rest of
the face I'm going to be taking a course
the Australis fresh and flawless this is
in the shade deep natural and i usually
use the shade darkest brown but I
actually picked up the wrong shade
without noticing now to make us look
like a bronze contour goddess I'm going
to be taking the whole the benefit
bronze are and i'm just going to be
contouring my face so really carving out
my cheekbones defining my nose and my
jawline and also contouring my temples
and i love using an angered brush for
this so i'm going to be taking it the
bhcosmetics angled flat top kabuki brush
whoo and as I said because I am really
focusing on the face I'm going to make
this contour really really strong so if
it either be too strong for your liking
as you can really turn it down to how
you're comfortable with it but I just
think a really strong contour goes
really well with this makeup look
can you guys see that my max awesome
gentle just shattered both my favorite
highlighters have shattered anyway movie
back onto this is a video no time to be
sad now I'm going to be taking the brush
that comes with the benefit bronzer and
just contouring my nose now he was
taking the whole a benefit bronze LA and
I'm just going to start by working this
into my crease and starting on the outer
crease I'm going to be blending that in
all the way up until the bridge of my
nose I'm not sure if that makes sense
but you guys kind of getting an idea of
what I'm doing and now I'm just going
ahead and blending that I shove it along
the lower lash line and that is what
we're doing for the eyeshadow because as
I said the main focus of this arm
tutorial it's the face
now moving on to blush and of course
keeping the bronze tones i'm going to
using the Rimmel London blush in the
shade at 10 or 210 Tuscany now I'm going
to start by applying this just above the
bronzer and then bring it forward and
just lightly dusting it onto the apples
of the cheeks I'm just going to be
highlighting my face now and this is the
most important thing about this makeup
tutorial I think so starting out by
taking the Revlon Photoready skin light
face illuminator in the shade at ballet
so going to be applying this on my inner
2p adult on my brow bone and on the tip
of my nose and a tiny bit on my chin can
be sure when you're doing this not to
try get it in your eyebrows like I just
do but i don't like applying this to the
high points of my cheekbones because i
feel like it rubs already rubs off the
powder products that are already over my
face
tany my mary-lou manizer by the bomb I'm
not going to open this and show you
because it is shattered so it would just
crinkle everywhere I'm just going to be
applying this to the places that I just
highlighted as well as my Cuba story and
above my brow bone now many of you guys
are sitting there thinking wow that is a
lot of highlighter that's because it is
a lot of highlighter but I just like the
look at gears it gives this really like
gorgeous glow to the skin now to finish
off the eyes I'm just gonna be taking
the L'Oreal Paris false lash wings
mascara and I'm going to be taking the
smallest amount of this and just
applying it to my lashes
and I'll see you open the eyes are a
little bit more i'm going to be taking
the maybelline of big eyeliner and just
using the website just to apply this
into my waterline box look at my
eyeliner pics and i was a very last step
of the makeup tutorial I'm going to be
applying some lipstick this is the color
inject moisturizing mineral lipstick by
australis in the shade Marburg or memory
and this is like the perfect nude I
absolutely love this food it's my
favorite one
