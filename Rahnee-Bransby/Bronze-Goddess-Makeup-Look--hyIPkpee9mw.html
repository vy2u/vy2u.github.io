my channel there today I have filmed a
bronze goddess makeup look I wanted to
film one of these videos for the longest
time because bronze glow egotistical
boobs are my absolute favorite every
single time I go out this is the makeup
look I would kind of lean towards
because I feel like with my skin tone
and my features bronze and gold and like
just all these glow attorneys match my
skin tone the best so this is my take on
a bronze it's got I think a look if you
would like to see how I achieved this
makeup look then please keep watching
and let's just jump straight into it you
guys like moon now that I've had a fist
on this side I feel like this side is
feeling a little bit lonely and bad
sorry I'm gonna have to find something
to put on this side but I really like it
I don't know where to put it I really
wanted to put it in the middle here but
then I sat down then I hid it so and to
also buy my next video I don't think
this record player will be here anymore
so this is your body starting out with
foundation I'm going to be using the
Giorgio Armani luminous foundation in
the shade 5.5
this is such a gorgeous foundation that
it is so luminous so glowy so I think
this foundation is perfect for this
makeup look oh my god I just ran around
so now I'm losing my breath I think to
do that the start of every video so I'm
just going to be buffing that in with a
dad Beauty Blender
to conceal a highlight I'm going to be
using the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
concealer in the shade light as I'm
going to be applying this under my eyes
and down the bridge of my nose on my
forehead and on my chance and of course
going ahead and blend a lot you know
with a jacket like now I'm just going
ahead with my awesome Jade contour
palette and taking at the banana shape
to set onto my eyes and down the bridge
of my nose
like I said the rest of my face with my
Australia specialist press powder in the
shade darkest Brown and not this as well
the fun stuff starts we can start
getting really super bronzed and glowy
sorry to lightly contour I'm just going
to be using at this Ashley brown shade
in my Alice and Jen contour palette I'm
just going to be contouring my
cheekbones my forehead my jawline and my
nose and also to add some color back
into my face because I'm looking super
bland right now also one of my first ask
questions is what brush I used to come
to this is just the zoeva 1 to 6 lots
cheek finish brush
oh my god I'm so freaking excited in
about a week or two weeks I'm going back
to the hairdresser's to go back to LA
because as you can probably see all the
white so my husband when I went to three
care because I was swimming in chlorine
so much and because of the Sun it just
kind of like washed out my color but it
is still kind of white these lights just
don't pick up but I'm so excited
quite from microfiche it is not a bronze
that goddess makeup looks without
Maccabees son so now I'm going to be
taking my Mac give me son I'm going to
be doing it super pursue this and just
bumping up all over my face oh sorry
I've been getting asked so much from you
guys if I am going to celinda in the
grass and unfortunately this year I know
I was lucky enough to get the
opportunity to go to splendour the girls
but I was learning up at that last week
and that is and that is super late
notice so I knowing that if I just had a
story I would be stressing about outfits
stressing about my flats stressing about
accommodation and stuff like that
excited just for my own benefit so I
wouldn't be stressing and going crazy
that I would give up the opportunity and
they're not going to see ya but next
year for sure
110% super bummed about it because it's
Monday in the grass seriously looks
amazing like it is just like oh well can
explain so I'm super upset that I'm not
going to be sending this year but next
year for sure
did I come a little bit too much give me
some ones as I say well I'm still
reliable okay I think I'm done and now
I'm going in with my Milani baked blush
in the shade it fell into Syria from
this is just like a gorgeous intensive
bronze gold shimmer shade so I'm going
to be applying this onto my cheeks just
because I don't have enough room on my
face now I'm just going ahead and
quickly filling in my brows with the
Copart brow pencil initiated don't type
I have insurance pronounced talked about
for this I'm going to say tired because
that sounds cool sorry I just finished
up filling my brows in with the color
brown so that is the first time I've
actually used and I freaking love it
maybe you don't see eyes I'm going to
start out by taking my makeup geek
shutter and they show you two creme
brulee and just working that into my
crease as my transition
it wouldn't be a bronze goddess makeup
look if it didn't have any color for
shadows sorry I'm taking the color pub
super shock shadow in the shade weenie
and I'm going to be applying this on the
outer corners of my eyes
so you blend that out through the crates
a little bit more and talking up the
look I'm going to be taking makeup geeks
cargo Beth
and now I'm going in with the color
posted super-sharp chatter in the shade
at kpop sunset boulevard and this is
just like a gorgeous gold tone and I'm
just going to be packing this all over
my lid
and now I'm going in with this dark
brown shade here could brown sugar by
makeup geek and I'm going to be blending
this along my lower lash line
sorry I just went ahead and applied some
falsies and some mascara these are the
adult under wispy it's my absolute
favorites and now I'm taking the color
pub super shock shadow English ain't
girly and this is just like I really go
just probably white shade it kind of has
like yellow gold reflexes in it and I'm
just going to be highlighting my inner
corners with this alpha hollowness to go
super crazy and glowy I'm going to be
using in the color part of super sharp
chic the super I can't take this pink
color pump the super shot but I can't do
it
the colour-pop super shock cheek in the
shade wisp and I've actually never used
this as a highlighter before so I'm
creating this goes well oh my god
at Apple the last step which is live and
keeping the whole purpose of the bronze
goddess make a look I'm going to be
doing nude lips I'm going to be taking
the colour-pop lippie pencil in the
shade Chi by the way this is not
sponsored by color pub I just recently
got a bunch of their products so I
wanted to try them all out and this is
one of my favorite lip liners I love the
color of it

lips
