hey hey guys yes Ronnie and welcome back
to my channel so today I thought I would
sit down and film a little chitchat get
ready with me I haven't done a beauty
video in the longest time why am
I saying
I haven't gotten a beauty video in the
longest time so I'm kind of excited to
just sit down and do my makeup and talk
to you guys so yeah without further ado
let's just jump straight on into it and
I really hope you guys enjoy so can we
just thought out by announcing the
elephant in the room that my hair is
almost fully pink if you don't join me
on Instagram or snapchat or anything you
wouldn't have seen it I am just going to
quickly pry my skin with the Marc Jacobs
invisible undercover our charisma primer
so as you guys know I've had pink hair
for a very long time now I've already
got it on my hands and okay to tie my
hair up so as you guys know it's ones
that is this week actually and I'm so
freaking excited I've never been to a
splendid before so oh my gosh I'm so
ready but plus Linda I decided I wanted
to do my hair almost fully pink so I
just pink all the way up to the root
almost I left a little bit on my natural
root color just because um if I went for
looking how to like it look like a wig
and I already feel like it looks like a
wig because it's such a crazy color but
um I understand through that I think you
look so so cool in the process of going
think I actually had to go back to on
before I could go pink so that the color
would stick more and oh my god I miss my
blonde hair so much so I think when I
get back from splinter I'm going to go
back one because I do miss it I really
do so now I'm just going in to be Marc
Jacobs
do you do drops so these are like this
is like a coconut gel highlight our
thumb I know it's a highlighter but I
love what putting this on my foundation
because it gives the skin like a really
freakin nice golden globe
polarization today I'm going to be using
your the Natasha - Nona foundation at
full coverage fruit complexion
foundation so you have it this is in the
shade at 48 medium now this foundation
is sonically incredible it is quite a
thick foundation but it's very loosely
at the same time so it doesn't feel very
heavy on the skin and I'm just obsessed
with it and shout out to Michael he
actually got sent like most of the shade
III gave me all these darker shades
because he was going with them and
that's a very foundation so it love you
done so I was actually going to ask you
that if you had any new TV shows that I
could watch because I was obsessed with
a Riverdale and 30 min supply and Elise
do they only have one season so I
literally watch them in like one day but
my friend said to me the other day have
you ever watched seriously and I was
like not sure like what why I was like
because that shows like select relay
from 1998 it's not really it's not like
2000 agree I decided to get a guru and
holy I'm so obsessed with it I
started it last night no or yes like
episode 7 or 8 so if you guys have
watched it see how the eniac
conversation with me down below about it
or if you haven't you definitely have to
watch it because it is honestly one of
the best shows I've ever watched and I'm
only like 7s posted so thank you so now
I'm just going to throw it in with my
NARS concealer in the shade custard this
is by far left is my favorite concealer
at the whole bag laughs oh my god I can
just see at the comments of me talking
like this already
whenever I talk like that in my videos
or whenever I say another problem or
hate jump
sorry many people not educate honestly
that was very federating but a few
haters I guess you could call them
comments with us and say oh my god your
lecturer are always copying Shia and
Michael you don't sort of want to talk
like that and I just find it funny
because obviously they are still my best
friends and I'm sure you and your best
friend not like you - but the haters if
you're tuned in as well you guys have
like those friends that you have a
linger with or that you have some things
that you would say so like it's not like
I'm trying to copy them because they're
like my best friends so obviously we
always talk like that
trust me when you're around them it is
so hard not to talk like that I
even put it home and all my friends are
like y'all actually have to stop talking
like that
and I'm like what it's all fun and I'm
sure you guys see the same thing key
because it's such a habit and it's so
fun to talk like that actually speaking
of sayings I honestly cannot start
saying now in one of my recent vlogs
when we were booking America so I had a
lip gloss in my hand and I had lip gloss
on for Portia's going to bed instead of
lip balm for some reason and we were
sore like why the hell do you have lip
gloss on when you're going to bed I was
like holding the lip gloss in my hands
and all something about the lip balm and
I was like ride out there and I
can see it like see you later if
I didn't graduate two years ago out of
written on my own graduation book dried
up man I can see it with
see you later
so now I'm just going to take the
Australis fresh and flawless in the
pressed powder in the shade at darkest
Brown and I'm just going to lightly set
my face um yes
I'm now just going to take the
sweetheart bronzer by it true face and
I'm going to lightly brush my face just
to add a bit more color into my face so
as you guys know I'm sure you've heard
about it from me every single video
because I can't stop talking about it
but I go to America in like a month and
a bit and I'm so excited
I literally been dreaming of going to
America like ever since I was little and
when it's good as a so long but one day
I'll do it so that's shining like we're
going to a marathon the state and I
don't care what you say and they're like
let's do it so yeah we're all going to
America so if I were only going through
LA and New York
I would love to in the future road trip
around America when I have like a few
months freeze like maybe it's like a
month or two I would love to do that if
you guys have any places in LA and New
York that you think I would love
anything that I should visit definitely
leave them in the comments below because
I'm so excited it's honestly crazy now
I'm just going to go ahead and light it
come to my face with Miami cloud via
contour palette and I'm thinking this
middle shade sorry how's everyone last
going at the moment I know there's a lot
of intense stuff going on in my life at
the moment
good and bad um life is honestly just
Bennett so I create with the past like
month to true week is honestly so much
this changing and so much is happening
not only with me like with a lot of my
friends as well so everything is just
happening right now is crazy but oh my
god I was supposed to say this at the
start of maybe right I have so many new
subscribers now it is honestly insane
query if you're new welcome hello I'm
Ronnie um
if any of you and you don't very much
about me I'm Ronnie I'm asking you
though because I get a lot of questions
asking Khalid I am yes so I'm only 19
and I'm obviously Australian I live in
Perth which is in Western Australia but
now I'm in the process of deciding that
I want to move to digital not I want to
grow this so guys but obviously I have a
whole life here sorry I just got to have
a really big think about it and see what
I want to do
what's going to be best for me and work
out for me but I'm still to this day I
cannot believe that I did 100,000
subscribers about nine eight hundred and
ten thousand and it's honestly crazy
like 100,000 was my goal for a very long
time in the fact that we finally get an
hour on 110 so soon is incredible and I
know recently with my uploads and stuff
I haven't been really how do you say it
I've been able to act with everything
just to do that life that there's so
much going on right now in my life or
other so not really going to see me once
before America which is a September so
for the whole month of August I'm just
going to stay home focus on YouTube or
focus on my life thought out there I'm
doing with everything and get back into
the swing of things it's so sad to me
when I put a flash and you know I'm not
pumping out videos these days because I
feel like I let you down but I don't
think everyone sometimes me sucking bit
of a break and my roots will just kind
of chill out and to gather all your
thoughts and figure out what the hell is
going on and yes so that has been me for
the past week now I'm just going into
this wet and wild it shimmer palette in
the shade rose gold goddess and I'm
going to use this as a blush and just
apply it to my Chi
now I'm just going to take my hot
twinkle now I'm just taking my tots
Quinn how many times are so
tries buy this now I'm just going in
with my hot skin at twinkle volume three
lightning pellets so this is a
highlighter palette when I saw sleeves
that I actually didn't really like it so
much I don't know why but now I'm
obsessed really like the colors in there
I'm seriously flirting beautiful Splenda
I'm gonna go to aisle it I'm going
around in circles we will my selfies I'm
like jumping from one to another
bathroom of a backpack back favorite
spot postman - I ordered a pair of pants
which if they arrive in time you'll see
but they are so freaking cool and
they're so me like I wish I could show
you right now see could be like holy
crap and I ordered it a month ago when I
was in Brisbane and I was like god
that's like literally I'm not going to
do it that's so much time for it to
arrive so I ordered it and then two
weeks later it got shipped and oh my
gosh now I'm stressing because like
Flint blenders in like three weeks so I
was like oh that's still three weeks my
creators do a long time for a package to
come so the tracking number didn't
actually get updated so pretty much that
it had it being shipped out for like two
and a half weeks okay oh my god I'm
definitely not going to get it and then
the tracking I'm at now is in New York
City so I leave in today I driving up
gotta arrest me on time and I'm
stressing sorry bad honestly I think the
thing that was supposed to be the most
is like I didn't it wasn't cheap like I
paid a lot of money for it and the
tracking and the shipping was like $40
so that'll definitely get it to me like
within a week and now it's being a month
and as it comes to me so little bit
stressed there but I'm sure I can figure
something out
so I just quickly jumped off camera and
filled in my eyebrows with the benefit
Corral um quoi made I actually haven't
used a pomade it might screw you sorry I
use it the other day the first time in
two years and I speaking fell in love
with it again I love how sharp and
defined debrahliz so now moving on to
eyes sorry I'm going to take my top Pro
palette by part
this palette is honestly amazing like
the shades in it are so beautiful so I'm
going to take the shade here which is
called whimsy and that's pretty much the
only shade I'm going to using so I'm
going to start out by blazing it through
my crease and then work it all over the
lid and I can never talk while I do my
eyeshadow so play the music so now I'm
just going to take that same shade and
pack it all over my lid and then run it
along the lower lash line as well so I'm
going to point out this one shade like
smoked up like that around my whole eye
sorry that's pretty much all lines will
be eyes I just love like the really
burnt hot smoky look sorry I'm just
going to quickly jump up camera and
apply some lashes because that's Barnes
left and I'll be right back so now that
the lashes and mascara is on the last
thing out to do for this makeup look is
lid I'm going to start out by lining my
lips with the Immaculate to initiate a
strip down I don't really like to line
my lip because I already have a really
big lip so I feel like it looks super
funny so I'd like to do this are really
softly on the lid
now I'm just going in with Jeffrey's our
liquid lipstick interchange celebrity
skin and I'm just going to apply this
all over the top
and to finish off the lips this is a
little bit random but I love doing this
with this makeup look because it is faux
bronze and glowy I like taking the heart
gleam team highlighter and sculpting pen
it is has a liquid on one end and a
cream on the other end so I'm just going
to take the cream products and just
apply this on at the center of my lips
just to give my lips a little bit more
of a kick glossy and I don't know I just
like the look of it it looks really
really nice - Malina shut the whole look
I'm just taking across my trusty old
Evans Cate or not so great and start
this bitch implant that was half like
Scottish and half something else I have
no idea what that one
so that happens that is the finished
makeup look and little jacket ready with
me I really give you guys enjoyed this
