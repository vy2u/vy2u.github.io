like amount you're supposed to have I
don't have lost any teeth hello
everybody its Ronnie and welcome back to
my channel so today I'm filming a
question and answer video right now I
don't remember the last time I filmed
one of these I honestly think it looks
like a year and a half ago so I asked
you guys to ask me questions on and it's
around post so I'm going to get straight
into it today and answer them I hope you
guys learn something about me that you
don't know already so yeah let's just
jump straight into it what conspiracy
theories do you believe in so I recently
stumbled across Shane Dawson's
conspiracy theory videos a few months
agree and the FIR the day I found them I
literally watched every single one in
that day I was sorry interested in so
intrigued so when I started watching
them I was sorry interested within
conspiracies
so there is a few that I do believe in
but may not be true but I still do
believe in the first one I believe in
which is one of the most talked about is
the Mandela effect that thing hurts my
head like when I first found out about
it I was like okay weird but then when
stories started to come out about it I
was kind of just like oh my god like for
example how they say sex in the city is
actually called Sex and the City and
they say that it was never called sex in
the city but I specifically remember it
being called sex in the city I even have
a perfume box it's like a perfume
collections website I got when I was in
year 6 or something and every single
bottle was so Sex in the City on it so
that one kind of just like plays with my
mind a little bit like literally I just
don't understand
also my list right now is so bad because
of my own design and the other one that
makes me retard about the mental effect
is from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
I'm pretty sure you guys have all heard
about this one where the evil queen says
mirror mirror on the wall who's the
fairest of them all so that was one of
my favorite movies
and literally a hundred and ten percent
remembers its saying
mirror mirror on the wall because I used
to repeat all the time when I was little
like even I was talking to my mom about
it and we were like what the hell but
now if you try to find footage of it
saying mirror mirror on the wall she
actually says magic mirror on the wall
he literally said mirror mirror on the
wall but now it says magic mirror on the
wall it's weird and also if you haven't
already seen Shane Dawson series on
conspiracy theories I'll leave a link
below you seriously have to go watch a
man seriously make you question your
whole life if you had to choose between
statement necklaces or Sony's for a
whole year what would you choose I'm
sure all of you knows sunglasses and
jewelry or necklaces I like my
number-one thing like they're my
favorite accessories ever I always wear
jewelry and in every single my photos
I'm wearing sunglasses I even have a
pair of my hair today and I think
sunglasses and accessories pull a whole
look together so this is a very
difficult question for me but I would
probably choose sunglasses because
literally I can't go a day to that buy
her originally by like two new pairs
every single week so I probably had to
say sunglasses wait I would go a whole
year without wearing necklaces are you
going to be doing a festival series on
your channel for the upcoming it's
season now when I asked you guys to ask
me questions I saw this question because
I was just randomly rating through them
and when I saw her I started talking to
Brandon about it and I would love to do
a festival series for example I've
already done at festival makeup looks
and I've already done festival
hairstyles and I do also have a festival
look book or like outfit ideas video
coming up very very soon
but like festivals I'm so passionate
about them in a weird way I know they're
just a music festival they literally
just make me so happy and when I'm at
festivals I'm actually like the happiest
I've ever been so if you guys would like
to see some sort of festival series or
if you want to comment in the comments
below what sort of festival videos you'd
like to see then I would freaking love
to do that what did you do before you
were a youtuber now I was actually very
lucky my youtube actually kind of got
big while I was in school so as I
graduated years 12 last year and this
year I got straight into YouTube and
just did YouTube full-time but as my job
before I was in Shiva or while I was
doing YouTube I worked on a cafe called
the Coffee Club
whoo so I mean coffees done I was also a
waitress I literally actually loved
making coffees why juicing not so much
at that cafe but any other cafe I would
totally do it I didn't mind it but like
Noah's days where I was like I am never
doing this I hate this but yeah before I
did YouTube I was a waitress and I
studied at school if you magically had a
kid right now what would you call it I
actually have a few names written in my
phone which I love like girls names and
boys names but my two favorite names I
actually had a friend named homeschool
when I lived in Broome and her name was
this and her brother's name was oozed
and ever since then I beloved these
names so much so I feel like if I ever
had a girl I would call her Aston and if
I ever had a boy I call him the hard
part because I just love those names so
much I feel like if I was to ever have a
baby I would give it a name that isn't
very popular I'd give it kind of a
unique name because when I was born my
mom gave me quite a unique name and I
really met to Ronnies in my whole life
which is so crazy so I asked him for a
go and Harper for a hapa for a wolf I'm
thinking of tummy head brows baby's ass
your wolf oh my god I'm so freaking
obsessed with her right now I'm like
head over heels in love with that family
anyway favorite smoothie now there's the
thing in Australia I don't if it's
anywhere else but it's a place called
Bruce if you ever go to Bruce or if you
ever just want to make a smoothie make
this because it is seriously the best
thing I've ever tasted
strawberries watermelon mango half a
lemon vanilla yogurt and ice you will
thank me later I promise
what was your dream job when you were
younger now I dream job when I was
younger was actually to be a singer do I
get any ideas from that I cannot seem to
say in the life of me but I just loved
you performing and loved singing when I
was little sorry I really wanted to be
like a pop star like I wanted to be a
singer when I saw sell out stadiums I
don't want to sing for everyone but when
I was young I have so many dream jobs
like I used to want to be a teacher sort
freaking bad I saw a cop at like 6:00
a.m. every morning when I was little I
don't know why I got the 6:00 a.m. every
morning
pour some diet coke into a coffee cart
and pretend I had coffee I go into my
playroom which I got had a room full of
kids and I'll say I just sit down with
my cup of diet coke at 6:00 a.m. in the
morning and they're like welcome back to
class guys today we're going to be doing
a math lesson I was a freaking awesome
teacher I'll tell you that can you
please tell us how you edit your
Instagram photos now I think this is my
number one most commented comment I've
ever had sorry if you guys want to see a
how I add my instrument photos video
then be sure to leave me a comment below
and I will definitely do that I've
always wanted this who takes your
Instagram photos for you drum roll
Brayden takes every single one of my
it's red borders well myself is that you
see me standing next to a wall or
something 99% of the time Braden has
taken them I don't show you law I'm
having a boyfriend that is good at
taking photos god bless funkiest hand :
you have ever gone now the craziest help
live at the heart is probably the silver
or gray which I recently have had I
still kind of have it but it's kind of
like fading again it's very much
maintained but other colors I've had is
dark brown black red purple dip dyed the
ends of my hair pink when I was when
you're eight super stylish I know um
white blond blond
belliard silver I had a lot of colors
but it's really weird because I haven't
dyed my hair that much so I had a lot of
colors but I've had words I don't have
that much of any sense but for an
upcoming festival and doing my hair a
little bit of a crazy color I dare you
guys to leave in the comments below and
guess which color it will be but I'm so
excited it is seriously stunning did you
ever encounter any mocking in high
school inside of YouTube and if so how
did you deal with it so when I started
YouTube YouTube wasn't that crazy big I
know i resided like four years ago but
it wasn't a thing that everyone does
like they're doing now there were a few
boys on my school that would take the
piss out of me and just like make jokes
about it and some people would be like
why do you do youtube you're going to
get nowhere it's so stupid and stuff
like that but then the funny thing is
now that my youtube channel has actually
grown and I have quite a following now
I'm seeing how successful I've gotten
from YouTube and other ones that are
like oh my god you're so successful
congratulations on your YouTube channel
that's so like crazy such a cool thing
like you're doing so well for your aid
and I'm like but I have no hard feelings
against anyone like literally I still
obviously say thank you so much and
stuff but back then it was kind of I
feel like it was just kind of a weird
thing sorry when I started people like
what the hell like what are you doing
but I never took it to heart because
YouTube is something I wanted to do for
a very long time and when I started
doing it I was so happy so anyone that
ever said anything about my YouTube
channel I was just like get lost like go
away I don't care have you any had any
crazy fan experiences now I do remember
a crazy one but literally I the worst
memory this is why I could never make
story time videos because something
happens to me and at the time I'm like
oh my god what the hell but then the
next day I try to remember it and I
can't remember but I do remember having
a crazy follow experience I just
I remember having it but I can't
remember so this was important question
to answer but if I remember it I'll do a
story time on it because I remember
adjusting insane so yeah that is what
the questions I have for you guys today
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video don't forget to about massive
thumbs up and subscribe if you're new
you're so leave a comment below a
question you want to know because I'll
either answer it down there or answer it
in an upcoming question and answer video
I hope you're all having an amazing day
as always stay pretty and I will see you
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
