back to my channel so today I have
recreated a card olivine inspired at
makeup look this is the photo that I
grabbed inspiration from I am aware that
someone has actually photoshopped but
the makeup on takara in this photo but I
fell in love with the makeup look and I
really wanted to recreate it for you
guys I also asked you guys to screenshot
the photo on my snapchat if you wanted
to see it and totally how it you guys
went crazy with those screenshots I've
never had so many screen shots in my
life so I thought why not but so if you
guys would like to see my take on this
Cara Delevingne inspired makeup look
then please keep on watching
starting with foundation I actually
haven't used this one before it is the
covergirl outlast stay luminous
foundation I wanted to get this
foundation ago today because in the
photo car looks like she has a really
luminous like healthy glow to the skin
and heard in the color matches okay
hopefully we'll just be out of work with
it and I'm just going to write that into
the skin with a Jackie D Blender oh my
god is that oh my god I really don't
like the smell of this foundation you it
smells like a fruit or something
 Fela and going to be using the
Maybelline fit me concealer lightly
shaded 15 fair and just applying this on
to my eyes and down the center of my
face to highlights because Cara has a
really highlighted effect in the photo
I'm just going ahead and blending that
in with a damp Beauty Blender
mm my eyes I'm taking my Allison J to
contour palette and I'm just going to be
taking at the beading on shade in the
palette to set them
when talking about my pressed powder and
found my eyelashes hiding inside to set
the rest of my face I'm taking my
Australia's freshmen who live in the
shade office Brown
Makara has the most defined choose
without treat votes ever so I'm going to
contour with the matte bronzing powder
in the shade of bronze of matte and I'm
going to contour it very very intensely
because I mean her cheekbones like
Cara's so I'm going to be making some
and I'm going to bring that a little bit
further and that I usually would because
this is just going to make our treat
friend stand out a lot more and make our
face look a lot more contoured and to
find I'm just going to lightly contour
my jawline and my temples as well
maybe on I'm going to strongly contour
and define it the noise in the
photocards nose contour is very very
strong sorry I'm going to do this quite
intensely
well blush I would love to stick around
my bronze glow turns but car is actually
wearing a pink blush sorry I'm going to
be using my mother's for mineral powder
soft touch blush in the shade at glowy
one and I'm taking the shade at summer
heat which is this really luminous pink
shake here and mixing a tiny bit of
natural tan in and applying that to my
cheeks and it is totally okay to go over
the top of this because the car is
wearing this part intensely
Nakara
is actually not wearing any highlighter
apart from what looks like on her nose
so I'm going to take the shade of golden
glow from the same blush tree I'm just
going to apply this on the tip of my
nose and the bridge of my nose
and a little bit on my Cupid's bow but
I'm actually going to apply it a little
bit also on the high points of my cheeks
just because I can't live without
highlighter and I need it and I'm just
going to do that with my finger while I
sit you're going
I'm just going to apply a bit of lip
balm as you prep my lips for the nude
state because they have been a bit dry
lately and we don't want that Cara is
extremely famous for her big bold fluffy
brows so I'm going to fill mine in quite
intensely a little bit darker than I
usually would and make sure that they
look super fluffy in no go strangers it
machine
it's ours grape
fight and just do
give it
you're always in control
about
meaning they are definitely looking at
quite dark and intense but now I'm just
going to go in with a brow gel and just
set them and make them look a little bit
more fluffier and with the brow gel I'm
going to make sure I focus on brushing
all the heads up so for the eyes I'm
going to be taking my Mac and Bhutan's 9
- shadow palette I'm actually scared to
open this it's a little bit broken I
smashed it and it's those three shades
are broken so I'm going to start out
with this shade here which is just like
a medium tone Brown and just wipe this
into the crease as my transition shade
did that really just happen
all agree
don't you
no blue I'm not going in with the
darkest brown it's like a very dog
chocolate brown it's almost got a black
on return to it and I'm just going to
apply this on the out of eight
so I'm actually going to bring that in a
little bit further than the allottee I'm
going to stop it about halfway in the
middle of the lid and then just blend it
all out
sorry I actually had a really close look
at the photo and it does look like she
has a full smoky eye sorry I ended up
taking that shade almost all the way and
I just dropped before my cheer dot now
I'm going to the same shade that I used
on my lid and I'm going to really
closely apply this to at my lower lash
line and to blend out that color I'm
going to use the warm brown shade that
we used as our transition color
I'm going to add one card of the
masterpiece glamorous extension mascara
just to my top lashes just to prep them
before I apply falsies so I just went
ahead and applied lashes these are the
Aloha lashes 107 I'm pretty sure now I'm
just going to apply somewhat bottom
eyeliner this is my eyeliner now I'm
just going to apply some butter mascara
the ones on this mascara is perfect to
get bottom lashes and Cara's bottom
lashes were really defined I'm going
ahead and lightly highlighting the inner
corner of my eye with the makeup geek
pigment in the shade afterglow sorry it
has been about three hours since I was
lost with my makeup and then it's
because my camera died I would have got
something to eat and I still haven't
finished my makeup so I'm going to do my
lips now so I apologize if the camera
setup or the lighting on something has
changed so three hours later finally to
finish off the makeup look I'm going to
move on to lips and I'm going to be
using this chichi lipstick in the shade
let me tempt you and apply this to my
lips
it is literally so cold in Australia
right now my lips are purple can you see
that this is like a dark red shade with
a bit of a purple undertone very someone
threw the color that cara is wearing in
the photo
now I find this some street to be a
little bit more on purple side where
cars is more bread so I'm going to be
why am I talking like this so I'm going
in with Max Factor's lip finish here
lipstick in the shade always elegant and
to supply this on top this is just like
a dark red so this is just going to make
it a little bit more retro at men purple
so this is the complete and makeup look
I really hope I recreated it somewhat
similar if you enjoyed this video please
don't forget to give it a massive thumbs
up and subscribe if you're new
thank you so much for watching stay
pretty I'll see you soon I
this song gives me time infidelity it's
just like that it's going to road trip
and Hobbit clicking or sometimes Oh
