my channel so today I decided to film a
couch at get ready with me I've known
sat down and just relax and spoken two
guys in a very long time sorry I thought
there's nothing better than to sit down
and speak to dance today I have a few
things to do today I'm appearance Tehran
actually take some photos and do some
work stuff or so I thought I would just
get up that little bit earlier this
morning I film a video for you guys it
is now 9 a.m. in the morning but when I
started filming this it was 8am so I'm
terribly sorry if my voice is all but if
you'd like to see how I achieve this
makeup look then please keep on watching
and let's jump right into so ignore my
voice I have the worst morning voice
moment right now also quickly if you can
see the scratch on my face please ignore
it my mum's kit when I got into a fight
I guess in my sleep I'm not sure how
that happened but I woke up with a
scratch in my face and it is not cute so
let's get started I'm going to start out
by freshening up my face with you Mac
prep and prime this stuff is amazing if
you have early morning so I'm just going
to spritz my face it's on its last legs
so it's not cooperating that well with
me today I've been playing with my hair
too much no scratch my head I've got to
stop and go to stop so starting with
foundation today I'm going to be using
at the chichi fabulous and flawless in
the shade medium olive number 8 I
recently discovered this foundation
because it was in my collection but I
have never used it I think was because I
thought it was true dark for me but ASA
the other day and I matches my fake time
perfectly and I'm seriously so obsessed
with the coverage and so obsessed with
the finish of it is amazing diamond
suppose
dining names too
I'm just going to quickly focus on
getting this foundation on as fast as
possible because I look so tired today I
serve food I've had been dragged through
like a meadow of knives or something
like that I also have the worst I think
alike whatever those seasons transition
in Australia like we're an autumn now
going into winter I never worth taking
that in autumn and spring I never get it
in summer or winter but an autumn spring
I get you were safe people and it's so
bad I know it goes all big and snuggly
and my eyes go a little and swollen and
it's really just not a cute look in
general now to cover up those horrible
darkstalkers I was just talking about
i'm going in with my maybelline fitme
concealer in the shade at 15 fair and
i'm just going to be applying this and
triangles under my eyes and down the
bridge of my nose on my chin and on my
forehead
I swear every single day of my life I
have that song stuck in my head it's
just me myself or not so long till I die
good luck and got me for life always I
just realized why I don't do many sit
down to check it ready with me it's
because I can't talk into my makeup
because I talk with my hands so whenever
I do my makeup I straubing like this and
start talking and then it takes me so
long to finish my makeup story today I'm
going to try it multitask I'm not very
good at it I just want to quickly say
thank you guys so so freaking much from
the bottom of my heart for all the love
and support on my latest video the one
where I talk about I haven't been myself
it seriously means the world to me like
i did not know how I was going to get a
response like that and so thank you guys
so much for all your kind comments and
your love on that video quickly before i
go on i'm using the maybelline superstay
24-hour concealer and just apply this on
any blemishes that i may have all sorry
i just want to quickly thank you guys
again so freaking much for sixty
thousand subscribers i cannot believe we
hit 60 thousand subscribers like that is
insane we are so close to about say
40,000 we are so close to 100,000 so
that is my goal by the end of the year
hopefully we can hit it but thank you
guys so much it seriously means like
beyond words me you guys like melt my
heart thank you i'm gonna stop saying
thank you because that's what I'm
talking about right now I'm just setting
my under eyes with my alesandre to
contour palette
oh sorry I really wanna stop talking
about my latest video but I quickly have
one more thing today I guess about it
since Bruce in that video I found out
myself like in general just in person as
well not only online I'm so much more
happier and confident like it's like
crazy how just posting that video made
me feel so much I'll happier so much
more confident with myself like that
reason was the only thing that was
holding me back online and it's so crazy
that now I've let it out and now I can
be myself sorry i just looked back on
the footage and i was out of focus the
whole time I'm so sorry about that my SD
card actually broke I didn't even know
how it broke it's just broken so i'm
going with an old SD card edit films for
about five seconds and then stops and
already knows about five minutes of
footage sorry i keep taking out putting
it in my computer importing the footage
and i'm putting it back in its own way
now i'm just sending the rest of my face
in my australis brush and flawless in
the shade darkest brown also if there
are any products I don't mention be sure
to check the damn bar because i believe
all the products in there i know i
always say i will and i never do but
this time I will because I drove in this
video to have any crazy edit I just
wanted to be sitting down relaxing
chillin and told me with you guys now
I'm just going to contour with my whole
a benefit runs up as I mentioned in my
last video I feel like I keep referring
to a hospital but as I mentioned in that
video I said to you guys i was going to
phuket in three weeks with my boyfriend
and we just finished looking out would
be list i was staying in and they
seriously phenomenal like i am so
excited to go to Phuket I've never been
before I'm definitely going to vlog but
if you guys want me to film any other
videos over there let me know because I
feel like filming other videos I just
don't know what to film if you know what
I mean like of course I'm going to enjoy
my holiday but
I want to film and get like really good
content up for you guys because vlogs
are my favorite to edit you guys know
how much I love editing it seriously one
of my main things about YouTube I love
doing it I love just like mixing up the
quirky edit some like editing it's like
my number of everything and that's why I
love filming blogs because you can
really play around with editing and put
your own twist on it which is so cool so
I'm definitely going to vlog over there
I'm not sure if I'll vlog like the whole
trip in one video or break it into like
sections definitely blog as i said just
bats have any other video requests i
should film while I'm input can't let me
know or just in general if you guys have
any video requests that you think I
should film in general that you really
want to see let me know because this
week i'm on a filming rampage and i
haven't been uploading as frequent as i
used to have been up living like once a
week that's just because I've been so
caught up in life and I've been so busy
lately I mean trying to set up a new
background for you guys and I know that
some excuse like this big busy and
setting up in your background is and it
isn't an excuse this is why I shouldn't
film at 8am in the morning I can't talk
i'm now going in with my Rimmel London
match perfection translucent powder and
I just want to be breaking onto my
contour and down the bridge of my nose
shawnee the cheeky little devil has got
to be obsessed with baking when she came
to stay she showed me how to bake and
now I can't stop doing it like I have to
do it with it every single makeup look
but I just can't bring myself to buying
the laura mercier translucent loose
powder like I trash aunties and I'm
absolutely obsessed with it for the
prize I just can't bring myself to
buying out like so I really need it so I
really need a translucent powder for
like eighty dollars but i know that i'm
going to give you an it sooner or later
on i'm going to buy it I probably
goodbye today because I just needed this
is amazing I'm just grabbing a brow
powder and lightly running this through
my brows I did recently get my eyebrows
feather tattooed touch shop so that they
are fresh they actually heard yesterday
which is so good but I still feel like
what am i gon wake up I need a little
bit more powder in them just to make
them a little bit like more darker and
to find it away so yeah I'm just doing
this very very lightly and I'm not doing
much of a why I'm simply just quickly
running it through so that they have a
little bit more definition to them
now that they're a little bit dark I'm
just running the loreal brow plumper in
the shade everybody sure this is the
shape blonde at light/medium this
product is seriously so amazing but I
almost wish I got it in the shade medium
instead of light medium because it is a
little bit to be like for my hair's home
what are we doing now Ronnie well just
going to go ahead and dust off that bake
I'm not taking the mac bronzing powder
in your shade it refines gold this is a
very very old product I've had this in
my kids since I have a sudden makeup I
recently discovered it again the other
day when I was going through all my like
products I values and it is seriously
like one of my favorite products I don't
know why I stopped using it by the way I
just clicked in my head I totally forgot
to show you guys what makeup look I was
doing so I'm just doing like a very
natural bronze glowing makeup look I did
this because it's not very natural but
it's more on the Natural Science Hill
it's not as heavy I've been riding this
makeup look quite a bit lately I word in
my recent video once again i'm talking
about the freaking video but i was are
getting that be here and you guys
requested it like crazy so I thought I'd
film at as a to check out pretty with me
today because I actually don't know if I
said this but I haven't sat down the
spoken to you guys in a very very long
time
for the eyes I'm just keeping it nice
and simple and taking a refined gold
again and I'm just going to be blending
that through the crease and my lower
lash line so I'm going to kind of wing
this out towards my temple as well just
to give that kind of cat eye effect
oops always clean your brushes before
using them because this brush has black
on it and now I just transferred a lot
of flats my lower lash line oh no don't
think I'll know my camera as if I just
noticed that so I'm undecided whether to
apply lashes or not i don't think i will
just to keep it kind of like really
natural Bronson glowy sorry I'm just
going to coat my top and bottom lashes
with a few coats of mascara by the way
business card is one of my new favorite
is the Maybelline gnash gnash Maybelline
lash sensational full fan effect mascara
for my inner corner highlight I feel
like doing something a little bit
fondness so I'm going to take some
glitter and apply that on the inner
corners I ended up getting glitter or
down my face but I'm totally fine with
that so moving on to highlighter I'm
going to using the secret bubbling
highlighted by blunt Banali boy phenolic
oh if bonala Chloe I'm banila co I
hitting phenolic whoa but not been alla
hoy I'm not too sure how to say that but
this is another product that was having
in my collection that I haven't used in
a while I used to be obsessed this and
I've used it again recently and I'm
seriously in love with it so I'm just
going to be loading out onto the high
points of my face
and now it's at the very last step which
is lips I know I said this was a natural
makeup look but I've kind of thrown that
idea out the window now I kind of want
to do a dark bit because I haven't
wanted a bleep in a very long time so
this is the mac satin finish lipstick in
the shade film you're young you're I
hope I'm saying that Ryan go to show but
it's just like a really dark chocolate
brown so I'm just going to be applying
that to my lids
Oh
it is a very doclet it is probably one
of the darkest brown site re it's almost
like a black it has kind of like a
purplish red on the turn but i actually
really like so this is a completed
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you enjoyed this makeup
and this video please don't forget to
give a massive thumbs up and subscribe
