today I decided to just sit down and
chill out and boom and to check
everybody with me and this is a look I
came up with I absolutely love the
orange and the copper underlay that I
think it is so beautiful so if you guys
want to sit down and chill out with me
today and whom we talk about all sorts
of it nonsense then please just keep on
watching and we're going to jump
straight it - it flew I hope you enjoy
hello everyone as sorry as I just said
it today I'm going to be filming a
sit-down - jacket ready with me I've not
sat down in films in theory about a week
maybe two weeks now since my July
favorites because something happens
which I'll get into in the beer you
haven't heard let's just get this mop
out of my face so throughout this
chitchat get ready with me I'm not going
to have any crazy edits throughout the
video area and I'm not going to be
showing the products either I want it to
be super chilled out and relaxed and I
kinda want it to be like and you guys
are sitting here with me talking to me
so yeah I'm out of breath I don't know
why I'm always out of breath I'm in a
super talkative and energetic Murray
today and I don't really know why
because I wake up with my period this
morning and I have really bad cramps but
I'm gonna take advantage of that because
not every day you're this happy on your
period
so let's start off with foundation I'm
going to use the Giorgio Armani luminous
foundation in the shade 5.5 and I'm
going to mix that with a bit of the
Rimmel London and good to Glory
illuminator just to give my face that
like all-round glory because I feel like
being really fresh and glowy today
okay um sorry I'm just putting that on a
Beautyblender and I'm going to start
working on a skin
I'm not too sure what found a what sorry
I'm not sure what makeup look I'm going
to do today I was originally going to do
a like dark red maroon
um I know we'd like a nude lip of
something and I really feel like doing a
red look today I'll definitely do that
next week because I do want to throw one
of those but I just put in a freshman 10
so I kind of want to do a like really
bright orange I haven't done orange in a
very long time and as any other feelings
doing an orange I make em look so I
think I'm going to do orange today like
really glowy skin runs you skin like
always applying makeup when you have a
char on oh oh my god I sound so weird
applying foundation when you have a
tracker on is probably one of the
hottest things because that you have to
stop that now I'm just taking that
illuminator again and I'm going to just
apply it on its own to like the high
points of my face I feel like it's not
kind of sting some days it's a bit
really cold or it's stinging
I think bluffing to take off my
foundation I think that's a cough my
foundation on my nose okay scratch we're
not doing that so if any of you
following me on this snapchat it would
definitely learn what I'm about to tell
you and maybe even Instagram I think I
mentioned it on Instagram but 10 days
exactly today I got into a car crash and
honestly guys if you have been in a car
crash you with knowing being in a car
crash is one of these scariest things
you ever experience in your life and if
you have never been in a car crash
please be careful on the roads please be
safe when you're driving because it is
one of these scary things about and I
don't want anyone else to go through it
because honestly they were saying your
life flashes before your eyes
I seriously strongly bill you did now
after being in a car accident because
your life just flashed before your eyes
and it is so scary I really do not wish
a car crash upon anyone
I'm glad well I'm not glad but I'm happy
mine came out the way it did and it
wasn't any worse because it could have
been so much fun was and I literally put
aside which is so scary if you don't
have me on snapchat or you haven't heard
I was pinup stopped at a red light and
then I migrated to garner and as I took
off a car ran a red light coming from
the other way and I smashed into him I
was planning on doing a story time about
it but I feel like I've spoken about it
very much and I feel like people are
gonna oh my god shut up about your car
accident but it was just so scary I
kinda just wanna make everyone aware so
if you want to see a story time on how I
got into a car crash it please leave
Gloria and I'll just make one and let
you guys know like full detail of
everything that happened but that is why
I didn't have a video up last week
because I was just kind of like in shock
from it all happening I just I didn't
really do anything and you really want
to feel because I do not want to feel
when I felt like that and obviously I
didn't want to show you I obviously want
to feel when I'm a hundred percent happy
for you guys because obviously I don't
want to film a makeup tutorial over here
and they see me here being like hey guys
so today I'm what everything obviously
because that'll bring your weight down
and that's to fight not how I want you
guys to TVs but please I cannot stress
you enough base length on the roads look
before you go don't go on your phone
just literally when you drive be sorry
careful because there are some crazy
people out there and to people that
don't care about safety and they are the
people that take the lives of innocent
people of doing nothing on the road
anyway let's move on to something a
little bit happier
I don't know if you guys know but when I
was in school I was seriously of gym
junkie like I would go every single day
addy help like foods on health foods on
health foods
I was very strict with the gym and then
once I left I kind of just fell out of
the gym like it's not like I I don't
know I just got so busy and stopped
going and I stopped going for about four
months and noticed my body started to
change I started to put I've been way
back on not saying I'm fat or anything I
just did put a bit of weight on because
my muscles started to go down I feel
like in winter you kind of just
hibernate like I hibernate so much in
winter and I don't want to do anything
but that is the time I should be going
to the gym because then when summer
rolls around everyone will be like they
own but yeah I started going back to the
gym last week and started eating healthy
again just crazy how much working out
and eating healthy and make you feel on
the inside and out so once I get my body
back I do once we film like fitness
routine and what I eat in a day because
I guess any questions ask me to film
monitors and I never have because I've
been so secure lately but I definitely
do in a film at least my workout routine
I think that is one of the videos that
gets requested the merese sorry I'll
definitely film under is within the next
like two months less soon I'm just going
to quickly jump off comers who fill in
my eyebrows and I'll be right back I
have not had my browser on in about
three weeks so I'm getting them done
tomorrow and I'm so excited
do you guys ever get like super happy
once your brows have done like I just
feel like you can do your brows in like
three seconds whereas this took me like
20 minutes anyway moving on to the eyes
I think you're very intense or a Jenko
plus 20i I haven't used copper or orange
in a very long time so that's what I'm
planning
going to start with a transition shade
in my crease if you guys can guess what
shape this day is that I'm using as my
transition shade leave it Valerie and
I'll give you a kiss so in my crease and
the Atome I'm going to change the
Estella as the winter palette initiated
minds and I'm going to take this orange
shade here normative perception and just
blend that through the crease and out of
me as I just said so because I was
looking at a tiny bit fun because last
night I felt like no sleep I've been
watching any TV series which if you
follow me on Twitter you know what I'm
talking about
it is a strange of things I've actually
been watching that with Brayden but I
also started another TV series called
United States of Tara if you have you
have seen it leave in the comments below
because I'd love to know your thoughts
in it but it is pretty much a mom that
has a multiple personality than a little
over a multiple personality disorder so
she has four different personalities and
it's how like her kids and her husband
Joseph it and it is such a good show it
is very funny but you guys want a new TV
series to watch I highly recommend
giving the United States of well they
sent Tara because in America I feel like
instead of Tarr they say Tara but in a
certain way we would say taro the United
States of Tara
Oh stranger things I've been freaking
obsessed with them at the moment
seriously that's such good shows change
of plans I kind of feel like doing a
halo I sorry I feel like I'm sitting
really out right so because I'm sitting
on my foot and I don't feel comfortable
when I don't sit on my foot does anyone
else have that like no matter where I am
even what about the dinner table I feel
like I feel the need to sit on my foot
only at my dinner table no one else does
because that's really brood matters but
my mom's always like why is doing a new
foot I'm like I need to sit on my foot
to make it comfortable I can't see on my
bum you guys just saw me like scratch
see I'm going to do a head away so I'm
going to take the orange on the in a
half of my lid as well and leave a bit
of space in the middle which I haven't
done but that's the case we can go over
to that and I'm going to take the shade
americano by makeup geek which is like a
really dark chocolate brown and I'm just
going to apply that on the outer V and
inner corners of my lid
yeah
now they'll be sent out of my lid I'm
going to take this beautiful shade here
which is a very intense copper shade and
this is a flamethrower by makeup geek so
I'm just going to apply that to the
center of my lid miss your soul
Oh
so I just went ahead and applied it some
falsies of these are the odds of demi
whispies now I searched all over for
these lashes and I'm pretty sure they
like a few months old I think I've gone
through a few entities but we're just
gonna work with it and I also tried out
the Adele lash grip i shouldn't've the
doc one which is like the black eyelash
glue and honestly I'm never gonna use
that again unless I do liquid liner
because I thought it was gonna turn out
so good and it seriously sorry it might
know as a sorry hav scratching it but it
seriously just like ruined my makeup
look and went everywhere so I spent ages
trying to fix at every con I'm going to
take that orange shade again and I'm
just going to blend this along my lower
lash line
and I just take it to make up each other
again in the shade amerikaner and I'm
just going to apply that on the outer
corners of my lower lash line so I'm not
going to bring that all the way in
so now that look it's getting close to
an end for blush I'm going to use the
Rimmel n2 blush in the shader to tempt
health kane' this is kind of like a
peachy bronze shade sorry I'm just going
to apply that to my cheeks now oh ha ha
I'm taking my mary-lou manizer by the
balm I always dropped it um Lauren kind
of section spoke about this highlighter
in her recently area and I forgot I had
it and reminded me how amazing it was
sorry now I'm just going to apply this
to the high points of my face
now I'm just taking the colour-pop of
super shock cheek in the shade of width
and I'm going to use this as an inner
corner highlight and also on my brow
berry oh my god oh my god ow ow oh I
don't know what I just did but I think
like a barn cracked in my foot and it
literally felt like it just ripped in
half okay well step then we're done
oh my god there it goes again ow ow ow
ow ow that hurt
I'm from the rail step which is lit I
want to do a glossy lip so for the
lipstick I'm going to use the shade
Hepburn honey by Charlotte to read
and over the top of that I'm going to
take me every pilots lipgloss by the
balm in the completed makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it and if
