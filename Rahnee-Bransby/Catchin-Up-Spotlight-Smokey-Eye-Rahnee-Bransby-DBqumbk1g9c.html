right now without my phone look is it
guys I've actually lost my phone 20
minutes later I found my phone I left it
in my car I always think to leave me in
my car every single time I always leave
my phone in my car like you think that
would be the first thing you grab when
you get out the car no not for me
so laughing hey bro hey guys it's Ronnie
and welcome back to my channel so today
I am sitting down we're chilling we're
doing a relaxing sit down to chat get
ready with me kind of video this feels
so weird I've never started a video over
that makeup on before but today we are
trying something new now I like to call
these chit chat get ready with me on my
channel catching up because I feel like
this is the time where I get to sit down
and catch up with you guys and tell you
guys about some things that are going on
in my life and stuff like that sorry I
don't think this video is going to have
any crazy edits or anything because I
don't know I just feel like sitting down
and relaxing I've just chopped on a maxi
dress this by far is the comfiest piece
of clothing I've ever earned in my life
you'll see it very soon in a hole
because I have a massive hole coming for
you guys to get excited for that so now
I'm just going to get on into the video
I hope my water ready so I'm going to be
sipping on this throughout the video
sorry I'm going to start off with my
foundation now I actually tried this
foundation the other day and I really
liked the coverage and like the finish
of it so I'm going to give it another
great it is the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous foundation this is a mache 220
there are anything I don't like about
this foundation is oh so Paul is the
smell of it has the strongest now like I
can't stand foundations that have really
strong smells it smells like permanent
marker almost it just kind of freaks me
out when I put something with a really
strong scent on my face because I feel
like that's not normal I'm praying to go
this color matches because I have just
put on it fresh fake time so it is
developing so my body is quite dark but
I'm sure it will it
so as many of you know that I recently
spoke about a skin product - that um
cleared out my skin like crazy and that
skin product seriously what one works
wonders I absolutely love it
but my skin is breaking out so sadly
lately I'm the truth and so it's kind of
in the process of clearing now I'm gonna
get super personal heal my skin always
breaks out off to that time of the month
so mine is obviously just finished and
it's not loving me because it is
breaking out of it you know usually you
would break out before your period my
husband's after which is so weird I'm
going to be winging this whole makeup
look like I have no idea what kind of
makeup look I'm going for today I
literally have no idea I kind of have an
idea of what I want to do I'm not sure
if it will turn out good or anything but
I guess we're just gonna so guys oh my
god I literally cannot contain my
excitement this time next week I will be
18 ah it's so exciting to say that like
I've been hanging out for my 18th
birthday for so long now sorry I'm 18 On
January the 30th which will be this
Saturday and yeah it's just it's come
around sorry false like I can't even
begin to express how fast this year
already is going like it's always
February like that's not normal like I
don't know what I'm doing during the day
I think I'll just I think brightens just
planning something but during the night
I'm going to have a bunch of friends
over a priest and then we're going to go
out clubbing which I've already been
clubbing before so it's not gonna be
like oh my god but it's you're gonna be
fun because I can legally go out
clubbing
I'm February the 1st I thought to Sydney
to get my Invisalign which I'm so
excited for I know many actually I'm
gonna apply my concealer while I talk
and now I'm just going to conceal with
the wire so radiant touch concealer but
as I was saying two days off to my
birthday on February 1st I fly to see me
to pick up my Invisalign I am so excited
I'm really going to I'm really going to
be in Sydney for four day or three
really sorry the first to the fourth and
I'm saying with Sammy again and oh my
god guys I can't believe the time has
come when I can say I'm picking up my
Invisalign and my teeth are going to
start getting straight off that it's
like that it's probably one of the best
things that is going to happen to me
this y'all will be having straight so
you guys know how insecure I am about my
teeth and I'm just so excited like my
excitement is exploiting at the roof so
if you guys want me to vlog Stickney
again let me know in the comments below
because I definitely will this concealer
dries quite fast which is kind of
annoying because I may be here like
rambling my little bum all open now I
can still it has dried up in my face so
now of course I'm just taking my Allison
Jake onto a kit and taking the banana
shade to set under my eyes now a comet
just came through on my phone so I can
wait just came through then and it said
I spent most of the video waiting for
the clock to tick meaning my plug in the
background now the only reason I have
batteries in my clog which so many
people comment about it why doesn't your
Club take the RNA reason I don't have
batteries in it is because it is it
allowed this cheeky noise I never in my
life is like and I try to pull one video
and it was just sorry loud like it was
overpowering me tool so that's not any
reason why I don't have um batteries in
it I did have them in it but it was true
that
and now of course I'm just setting my
face with my trusty toaster all this
fresh and flawless now time for the eyes
I have no idea what I'm going to do I'm
just gonna wing it so I'm going to get
off camera I'm going to zoom you guys in
on my eyes I think I'll doing voiceovers
here and then I'll come back and talk
after because I feel like I can never
talk when I do my eyeshadow so
voiceovers it is so this eye look is
almost impossible to explain what I'm
doing it's very difficult to just tell
you guys how I'm applying the products
and stuff so I thought it was easier
just to watch if you want a full
in-depth
um sorry I keep saying um if you want a
full in-depth tutorial on how to do this
I would definitely do it but I think
it's easier to watch and understand and
me try to explain and understand I would
still like other products and everything
I'm using on the screen sorry yeah
so I just went ahead and applied some
lashes and mascara and I also applied
some black eyeliner on the outer half of
my lower lash line and on the inner half
Disrupt I applied the dot I shadow for
my lower lash line oh my god that was so
hard to explain so now moving on to
contour I'm going to contour with my
mouth casino bronzer this stuff is
amazing I forgot how amazing it was I
stopped using it for a while and I'm
using my nation contour brush these
people was seriously not cover up like
it's oh my god it's like this tub was
bought peeping through my foundation
like can you not
so I actually love you know that I am
also an Instagram blogger I'm a fashion
blogger on Instagram and so lately I've
been so like I don't know if you guys
realized but for a while I stopped
posting as much as I was like I post
once a week because I just wasn't
inspired like I had no motivation to go
take photos or anything and I think it's
because my Instagram was looking really
really bad that it just looked really
dull it didn't have a thing to it and I
need to ground things on everything but
I just love with my Instagram looks I
gots a theme going on so now I start
with my theme again and I'm absolutely
loving it I'm posting so much more now
I'm going for like more of a white and
blue theme like most summer I'm always a
bitch so I don't make it beachy so yeah
that's something am I going for now and
I absolutely love it like I feel like I
want to take Instagram photos over time
now so how many more outfit photos for
you guys and some people like beauty
related stuff so yeah if you have some
extra room and you like the theme at the
women let me know because I quite like
it yeah my makeup never looks complete
until I contour my nose like when I look
at myself when I have makeup on I go
geez something doesn't look right then I
contour my nose and I'm like on my
cheeks I'm going to be using my Rimmel
London natural bronze bronzer this stuff
is amazing it is seriously so cheap and
it just gives some my sport just like
sunkissed where she escaped
I just realized how close I'm sitting
for the camera right now it's gonna do
charm back a beer okay that's better I
was like in your face now I'm taking my
Mac soft and gentle mineralized skin
finish this stuff I've been using so
long and this is why because it scares
me to open it shattered like yeah it
shattered like a week after I got it and
it was the most depressing thing now I
barely use it because I'm just terrified
to open it but I used to the other day
and I forgot how amazing it work I'm
going to do a super strong highlight
today because I don't know I just feel
like doing a disco ball and now I'm also
just going to take out on my inner
corner to highlight now we've come to an
end for the very last step I have for
lips I'm going to be using my chichi lip
liner and shade its centerfold this is
the most gorgeous like brown it's like
stuff it's like the most gorgeous brown
nude I have it is like the perfect nude
with a brown on to turn I absolutely
adore it I think it's like the perfect
lip liner and now maybe that I'm just
going to add a tiny bit of nude gloss so
this is the Rimmel London apocalypse lip
lacquer in the shade nude eclipse now
this is like a full-on pigment of nerd
so I'm just going to be applying this
tiniest bit
and then this is the completed makeup
look that I came up with today I
absolutely love how it turned out I've
never tried anything like this on the
eyes before and I actually really absorb
