ponytail because that was bugging the
hell out of me and now I look like a
bold old man so let's just jump into the
eyes let's also just ignore my nails um
I can't really explain what's going on
with you right now with them horrendous
so let's just ignore that so I'm going

Cosmetics palette and I'm going to begin
by just taking this warm brown shade and
blending that through the crease now I'm

to talk to you guys about first of all

background is now Wyatt it's not that
ugly beige color because my walls before

color and I just hated it so much so I
painted them Wyatt and I also picked up
a few things from Urban Outfitters I got
any bed cover so this
no longer will look like this i'm so
excited and i also picked up a few other
things for my room so i'm just checking
out my whole room completely changing it
i'm so excited so I mean the process of
doing that animal and I also my
beautiful amazing friend here on YouTube
Sammy Robinson we did a trade thing I
really describe what we did or what we
swapped whatever but she for the trade
she bought me at lighting like the
lighting she uses and it's amazing I'm
so thankful and she's like one of my
little best booze and we're so close
we're meeting up sometime this year
because she lives in Sydney so she got
me some waiting at a red next week and
I'm so excited whoo so I think this
video and my next video will be the last
true with this backdrop and this lying
because I'm completely changing it and I
just cannot wait like Aunt I can't
promise anything but i'm thinking i'm
trying i don't know if you guys noticed
this week but I'm trying oh I don't know
if you guys notice last week but I'm
trying to be awkward um twice a week
because i don't know i just want to put
my offense my channel and my background
and editing and filming and stuff so i'm
going to be trying to upload twice a
week and let me go to come i think
that's something you guys would rather
than just once a week videos because I
would rather upload twice a week I have
a thing where I hate spending money on
clothes and like fruit and stuff I'm
fine but when it comes to buying big
things like lighting and join my room
and stuff I'm petrified like I just
don't want to spend money I'm just like
I'm saying like I'm constantly saving my
money so I'm like why am i spending here
like I'm not saving for anything why do
I just spend it so I wouldn't but pain
I'm so excited I'm finally so happy with
it looks beautiful um yeah and just so
happy with it my boyfriend helped me and
we had a lot of fun lot of ups and downs
I was getting really angry at some point
because the painters or the people that
lived in this house before me with the
blue paint that like painted my floor
and I was like what the hell is going on
they just did a terrible job so I was
really upset about that but it turned
out really well and the stuff I picked
to redecorate my room is awesome I can't
wait to show you guys now I'm just
taking the black shade in the palette
and this is what I'm going to use to do
my line are because I want it to look
smoky and stuff sorry I'm not using a
gel liner but I'm going to apply it like
I would with any regular I lied or gel
liner so I might just stop talking for
this part because active really
concentrate sorry I'm just using up and
i'm using a zoeva winged liner brush now
this is not sponsored or whatever but
the amazing girls at so either sent me
there rose gold brush there and guys it
is stunning like I just so thankful so
if you guys have it or you want to get
it definitely get it because the brushes
are beautiful they are just stunning
like oh that's so beautiful they're so
pretty why artistic brushes I don't know
I'm just going to be taking the Real
Techniques I think this is the angled
eyebrow brush but this is other wit pick
up so you can see the palette like
speaking in the background so this is
just going to build it up and make it a
bit more yes and thicker
there's i forgot to say i actually did
this in my recent haul video to shop
miss a halt and I did it with brown
eyeshadow and a lot of you guys loved it
so I thought I would kind of mix it up a
little bit into black and more of a
grungy look
you
I'm going to be taking the map 219 brush
and I'm just going to start by blending
and smoking out that liner so it gives a
really grungy and smokey effect
you
also I thought I'm quickly inform you
guys before I'm start blending and you
guys going what the hell is she doing
but it does take a lot of blending and
like touching up until you get perfect
but once it's done it does look very
good so please just bear with me while
I'm starting to blend it out because I
know it's looking kind of crazy
you
the too much can seal that in the wake
me up concealer and i'm just going to
pretty much finish off the rest of my
face now so i'm applying these under my
eyes down my nose and on my chin now i'm
just taking a Beauty Blender I'm
blending in the concealer now I picked
this up from ebay the other day and it
was really cheap i think it was like
four dollars and is seriously amazing so
i recommend spending like thirty dollars
on a Beauty Blender when you can get off
ebay for like four dollars i'll leave
the link to it below so you guys can
check it out if you want to because it's
just seriously amazing so just blending
that all out i'm also going to be fixing
up that um look and i'm also going to be
fixing up that liner while i blend it
out as well
I'm likin still around my nose my nose
gets sorry itchy I don't know why it's
just so weird lately happens all the
time I don't think also I wanted to
quickly take that about someone
commented this on my recent video and
they said i'm not sure if you notice but
you have a black smudge on g honorees
and I'm like that's just the shape of my
nose it looks like i have a black smudge
under my nose if you guys can see but i
think that's just the shadowing like
i've had that ever since i was little
even my mom one day was like what is
under your nose i'm like oh it's nothing
but i think it's just a shadowing of my
nodes and not even concealer or
foundation colors i haven't used this
product in a tutorial yet but I'm taking
the AC on to Australia's contour kit now
everyone raised about this proverb so I
finally picked it up and I'm so excited
I serve another product to show you guys
which I finally picked up and yeah so
I'm just going to be taking a paucity
famous banana shape here and I kind of
like to blend it in with this shade a
little bit just a tiny little bit and
I'm just going to be setting my nose my
chin and under my eyes
another thing I wanted to talk to you
guys about is I'm thinking of starting
to do more fashion videos like more look
books and outfits of the day and stuff
because if any of you guys follow me on
instagram and if you don't i believe the
name of it here um what's I going to say
now this track of thought oh yeah I've
got a lot of comments asking like what
my favorite pieces are in my closet or
what would I wear with this or stuff
like that so I'm thinking of doing more
fashion videos they are a little bit
more hard work to edit and feel like
that's what you guys want to see I would
definitely love to do that for you
because I love editing fashion videos
ages my favorite now I'm going to be
taking my trusty amazing fresh and
flawless australis press powder in the
shade darkest brown and studying the
rest of my face
now I'm going to smoke out the lower
lash line now and i'm just going to be
taking this dark brown shade here i
decided not to do black because i don't
want it to be too intense and to be hard
to blend because black is extremely hard
to blend so i'm just going to be taking
this along the lower lash line and I'm
know you're going to bring a half way in
and thence make it out to do it not
really smoky effect
going to go ad a pea coats of the lash
perm Oh chikara mascara to my bottom and
top lashes and then I'm going to jump
off camera and fly some falsies
after about 25 minutes of trying to get
this eyelash on this I head and finally
put them on now we on to proms are I'm
going to contour my face with the Nazca
senior bronzer so I'm just going to pop
out my cheekbones my forehead my temples
my nose and my jawline
so I really want to stick with you more
warm tones and bronze trains so for
blush I'm going to be taking the
Riverlands and blush in the shade to 10
Tuscany now this is just a really pretty
kind of warm tone orange blush
you
to be highlighting my face and I'm going
to be highlighting my foot is called
cheekbones my nose my inner tear duct
and my brow bone with the one and only
amazing mac mineralize skinfinish in
this shade soft and gentle can we just
like praises product for a second oh I
picked this up about three days ago and
I have not stopped using it it is
seriously heavenly it's so beautiful and
i'm sorry happy i found it picks it up
so i think i'm going to never stop using
this product can we just take a moment
like look how pretty that highlight is
is stunning I'm like overly obsessed
with it elderly oh honey
now for the most exciting part of the
makeup tutorial and the very last step
I'm going to be applying the black
lipstick now to line my lips I'm just
going to be using a black eyeliner
because lip liners and I line is a
pretty much the exact same thing and I
totally think if you're using or working
with black lipstick to line your lips
with a black or a dark color that you
can go over because I have tried putting
this lipstick on without it lining my
lips and it was tragic it literally I
just I don't want to talk about
you
you
now that I'm looking extremely crazy and
funny i'm going to quickly apply the
lipstick this is crazy with how funny
this is this what's ridiculous so i'm
going to be using the jeffree star the
lower lip liquid lipstick in the shade
weirdo now i picked this up from
princess Holly and I've never used this
lip products before but after I picked
it up and tried it I was like this is
amazing you guys have to purchase these
they have a bunch of different shades
and a huge range I will leave the
princess Holly link to this the UM
lipstick blue and also if you guys go on
foot cells poly and check out with
anything using the code Ronnie you can
get twenty percent off the entire store
and I highly suggest picking up one of
these because they're just amazing
and I thought the lips are on that is
the completed whoo so this is the
completed makeup look I really hope you
guys enjoyed it I'm really happy with
how it turns out I know I had a few
problems during the video but in the end
I'm happy how it turned out as I just
said that um I don't think I have
anything else to tell you guys or inform
you on but I love you please give this
video a massive thumbs up if you enjoy
it and don't forget to subscribe to my
