Christmas
hello beautiful people and welcome back
to my channel today I have this festive
Christmas holiday makeup look for you
all so if you'd like to see how to
achieve this makeup look then please
keep watching and I hope you enjoy so
you're starting off with a clean face
I've already moisturized using the Nivea
soft refreshingly soft moisturizing
cream and then I'm going in with the
true match foundation in the shade
creamy beige and I'm just buffing this
into my skin with a coastal sand flat
top kabuki brush
I also decided to paint my nails red and
white to get into the Christmas spirit a
little bit now taking the instant age
rewind
Darkstar Pete eraser in the shade at
lack pale and I'm just applying this
under my eyes down the bridge of my nose
on my forehead on my chin and on my
Cupid's bow to highlight my face and to
blend that all out I'm taking the mua
makeup academy stippling brush and then
I'm taking the sticks contour blush
palette by Coastal Scents and taking the
lightest shade in this palette just to
set my highlighter so it doesn't defeat
the purpose of how anyone ages my mom
with powder now I'm taking the Australis
fresh and flawless pressed powder in the
trade the darkest Brown just to set the
rest of my face and this pressed powder
is amazing so it seriously get your
hands on it if you can and now I'm
taking the hoola benefit bronzer and I'm
just going to be contouring and adding
some definition back into my face so I'm
contouring my cheekbones my jawline and
my temples and I am also of course
contouring my nose because I can never
go wrong with contouring my nose I
seriously think it makes every makeup
look look so much better
then I went ahead and filled in my
eyebrows and now moving on to your eyes
and taking the scandal eyes eye shadow
crayon in the shade bulletproof beige
and I'm just applying this onto my
eyelids as a base for my eye shadow and
then I'm just blending that out with my
finger and then I'm taking a whole of
benefit bronzer as a transition shade
and just blending that out and then I'm
taking my favorite palette at the moment
this is the galaxy shades palette by BH
Cosmetics and I'm taking the shades on
and this is just a gorgeous bold color
and I'm just packing this all over my
lid
and now taking these shades Aphrodite
and Jupiter I'm just mixing those colors
together and working that into the
crease
and then taking the transition shade
again I'm just blending everything out
and now I'm just taking a new shade of
Pluto and applying that in the outer V
and I was actually surprised the first
time I ever swatch this because I
thought it was like a dark gray black
but it actually is a permanent based
gray so I'm just applying that into the
crease and then blending that out and
now once again I'm taking the transition
shade and blending that through my
crease because we do not want any harsh
lines girlfriend I am now just lining my
waterline with a dark brown eyeliner
pencil
and now just taking Italy shada preacher
once again and I'm just waking up my
lower lash line and blending out that
eyeliner pencil just to make a look look
a lot more smoky and whatnot I am now
taking in the I love extreme crazy
Volume Mascara by essence and the
wonderful mascara by Rimmel London and
applying a couple coats of that to my
bottom and lower I always say that my
top and lower lashes and these two
mascaras work wonders together
now going back in with the palette I'm
taking the shade milky way to highlight
my brow bone and my inner tear-duct
aqua blush I'm taking the NYX blush in
the shade of peach and just apply this
to my cheeks and the guys that seriously
need help because I'm not sure if it's
pronounced pleats or NYX eye let me know
in the comments below and now I'm just
going to be lining my lips would be NYX
or inmate so there it's code lip liner
in the shade deep red and whenever I put
lip liner on I always feel like I look
like some sort of crazy weird-looking
creepy doll and then I'm applying the
lasting finish by Kate Moss lipstick in
the shade
111 kiss over twice and over that I'm
applying the apocalypse' lip lacquer by
Rimmel London in shape big bang for a
glossy finish
and last but not least we can not forget
to highlight so I'm highlighting new
high points on my face which are my what
are they called cheekbones my chin my
Cupid's bow my nose and my forehead and
now the look is complete sorry I hope

helps me out so much
