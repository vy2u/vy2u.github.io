channel so you signal the fact that I'm
sitting in my box and right now the
lighting is respective food suits me I
decided to film a little day/night
networking with me because Braden and I
arson liability fake night to my other
romantic shootout restaurant near the
beach so I started to get ready
absolutely guys where am i show you my
skincare showering and makeup outfit and
just all the things you do to get ready
because I'm just filming everything for
tonight I was going to be like school
and makeup and heavy makeup but honestly
with bread and a glass today I always
like was a very simple fresh makeup
because I didn't like wearing heavy like
help I think it suits me as much as
fresh and likes implementable and six if
someone handed earlier and ago I can
really show that restaurant I wouldn't
keep it nice and simple but yeah it's
not escapist it get ready to be really
realistic because as I said when I think
laughing that is bright and since a lot
of people and I at least looks the
opposite will change depending on
consciousness but it is at least sort I
just
accordingly I really think you guys
enjoyed this solidarity with me I feels
a little bit different so my album so
let me know you enjoyed it and this
video a thumbs up and let's have
experiences I'm starting off just get
ready with me with a shower of course
because you don't want to scare your
date away and be smelly so I'm starting
out with hair removal I'm taking me a
mass density of hair and we will clean
and I'm going to be applying that to my
legs I usually take 3 to 3 pumps per leg
but I do also use this on my arms and my
stomach as well because I feel like you
can use this all over your body
I love the fact that this is a new hair
removal cream because I have the most
sensitive skin in the world I react to
everything so this is one of the earning
products that I don't react to which is
awesome the other thing I absolutely
love about this it is very easy to use
and it is also slow create so all you do
is apply the cream to your legs or your
desired area that you want to remove
hair leave it on for 4 minutes and then
get a damp cloth and wipe it away and
then your hair is literally disappear
and it's gone it's incredible so much
better and so much easier and actually
so much better feel skin that than
shaving
also not products that have natural
extracts and oils in them because it is
really healthy for your skin and it
makes the skin really soft and silky
smooth so this has a natural extracts of
melon aloe vera avocados oil and honey
so it is makers through them protective
skin and also I will mention that these
people not painful at all it is
literally just like putting a
moisturizer on and then washing it
straight off I believe where you can
purchase this at links below so if you
do have something skin I highly
recommend giving us a go and then I'm
just going in with the levan body
hydrating body oil in the Centinela and
I'm just applying this all over my body
just to get rid of the residue of the
hair removal cream and also to make my
body feeling really soft and smooth and
snow really really good then I'm taking
me at Berkeley's sensitive facial
cleanser just to prep my skin up for the
makeup and this facial cleanser I swear
lie it is incredible it does wonders and
it cleans most in my creepy and it also
makes your makeup go on really really
well and before we move on for the
makeup I'm going to quickly prep the
skin so I'm taking the center-field
daily moisturizer and just applying this
all in my skin and then I'm going in
with the benefit is person eye cream and
just applying that on to my eyes and
then quickly spraying some deodorant
under my arms because that is a must now
time to get glammed up

prepping the skin I would usually use my
Mario's best Mario just give rose water
spray but I actually don't find it some
reason social foundation I'm taking the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
in the shade at 5.5 this has awesome
coverage and it has such a really nice
luminous glowy finish and because I am
doing it really fresh and glowy look
this is going to give the skin a really
nice healthy glow and it's just like a
really nice finish I really like this
foundation and maybe also you can see a
lot and taking in NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade custard and I'm

the bridge of my nose just to add a
little bit of coverage there I don't
want to go too heavy so that the end
places I'm concealing
