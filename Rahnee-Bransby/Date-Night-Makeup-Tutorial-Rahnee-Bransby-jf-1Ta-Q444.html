Oh
hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel thank you so much for watching
so today I filmed this makeup look on my
face right here I think it's perfect for
a date night or even just a night out
with friends in general i love this to
the premiere or train wreck last week
with Braden and I absolutely fell in
love with this makeup look over i did
pro it with a nude lip instead but for
the purpose of today's video because it
is based more around a girly makeup look
and more pink I thought I would go with
a pink lip and I never want people
lipstick before so let me know if you
guys like it because I'm not sure how it
looks on me I'm not to show pass sooner
or not so if you guys have like to see
how to achieve this makeup look then
please keep watching and as I said I
really love how it turned out so I'm
going to stop rambling on and let's go
so starting out with foundation i'm
going to be taking the lumia magic
foundation by l'oreal paris in the shade
pure beige and i love the color of this
foundation because it matches my fate
turn perfectly so i'm just going to be
taking a Beauty Blender and working this
into the skin and as you can see i am
dabbing it into the skin because it
gives more of a full and flawless
coverage whereas kind of wiping the
Beauty Blender onto your face just
doesn't give that nice effect so yeah
just working this down my neck and also
into my ears just so that it matches my
fate time perfectly
now can you tell that i have eyebrows so
I just went ahead and filled those bad
boys in now i'm taking the galaxy shoots
bhcosmetics pallor and i'm taking the
shade Aphrodite and just working that
into the crease and then I do go ahead
with a clean blending brush I almost
stopped at my word I claims blending
brush and just blend everything out so
that there are no harsh lines and
everything is soft and smooth
and now i'm going to be taking the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm just
taking the shade at marzipan and just
packing this all over my lid and I
cannot express you guys how stunning
this shade is it is seriously gorgeous
it's probably my favorite shade of
eyeshadow i have ever owned and now
taking oh and i'll take in the shade
cherry cordial from the true faced
chocolate bar palette i'm just going to
be packing this onto the outer V of my
eye wows about to go a line of force
entry I'm just talking this only out of
a of my eye and blending it directly
into the crease a tiny bit just to
darken up the look and give it a lot
more depth
and then of course taking a clean
blending brush and just blending
everything outside there are no harsh
lines and everything is smoky
and now I'm just going back in with the
shade marzipan and packing that onto my
lid again just to make it a lot more
pigmented and stand out a bit more
because when I was blending or the other
shades out it kind of blended up with
those shades and lots of pigmentation
now time to get rid of these dark
circles and blemishes I'm going to be
taking the wake me up concealer by
Rimmel London and just applying this
under my eyes down my nose on my chin
and on my forehead and now that I look
like a hot mess I'm just going to go
ahead and take my Beauty Blender
influence everything else and I'm also
going to be hiding up that eyeshadow
with vision sila as well
and once everything is blended out it is
then time to groove just joking now move
you onto is studying the rest of my face
I'm just going to be taking the
Australis contour kit and taking a
banana trade and just setting under my
eyes on my chin under my nose just feet
those places highlighted real real now
and now i'm going to be taking the one
and only australis fresh and flawless
press powder and setting the rest of my
face I can never go wrong with this
product it is seriously my ultimate
favorite and now just going back in with
the shade cherry cordial and just
applying this to my lashline and smoking
it out
and now moving on to mascara I'm going
to be taking the L'Oreal Paris fall /
butterfly's wings i think it's called
Masara i'm just going to be creating my
top and lower lashes and i love this
mascara it'll literally made some love
so long and lashes
and there I am just having another
little groove it never seems to stop and
I'll taking the shade champagne
champagne truffle I believe from the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette I'm just
going to be highlighting my brow bone
and my inner to adult and I'm moving on
to contouring and adding some definition
back into my face I'm going to be using
the cooler benefit brands are just to
contour my cheekbones my temples and
minors applause
and here you catch me just popping away
my baby hairs because they wanted to
make an appearance an aqua blush i'm
going to be taking the room alarms and
blush in the shade of pink rose i
believe and why do i keep saying I
believe so just smiling and popping that
onto the apples of my cheeks and now for
the most exciting part I'm highlighting
and this is my absolute favorite thing
to do so I'm just going to be taking the
mac soft and gentle and highlighting my
cheekbone my nose sorry the tip of my
nose my chin and my forehead
all right and of course we cannot forget
to highlight these Cupid's bow and now
moving on to the very last step of the
makeup look I'm going to be taking the
apocalypse lip lacquer from Rimmel
London in the shade I'll call you and
just apply that to the loops and then
that is the completed look I really hope
you guys enjoyed this makeup look if you
did please don't forget to give our
massive thumbs up because it means a lot
to me and if you try it out please
please send me photos because I would
love to see I don't think I have
anything else to say or inform you guys
