today I have knowns my everyday makeup
routine
I will this in my last video which was
my February favourites and this makeup
look got so many requests so I thought I
would film all for you guys I thought I
would film all for you guys so I thought
I would film it for you guys today it's
just very natural and glowy and fresh so
if you guys would like to see how I wear
my makeup on a daily basis then please
keep watching so cool foundation I've
been using the Maybelline fit me Julian
Smith foundation now I'm sure many of
you guys know that I love the matte and
poreless foundation but I decided to
pick this one up and give it a go and
I've been loving it I naturally have
really oily skin so I would never do a
Joey finish to a makeup look but this
one just makes my skin not oily at all
it has amazing coverage and lasts so
long sorry I've been loving the look of
this one for concealer I love using the
L'Oreal True Match concealer in the
shade vanilla and I just apply this onto
my eyes down my nose on my chin and on
my forehead to highlight and I blend
that out with these tip of a damp Beauty
Blender now this concealer is seriously
my favorite concealer in the world it is
better than any high-end conceal I've
ever used the coverage of it is amazing
it's so light on the skin yet still has
full coverage it looks so flawless on
the skin once it's blended out so if you
are looking for a fairly cheap and
concealer I would definitely recommend
giving this one a grow because it is
just heaven to set the places I conceal
and highlight it I'm taking what's left
of the banana shade in the Allison Jade
contour kit I am so sad this is running
out because this is the best banana
shade I've ever used in my life it is so
fine and it doesn't take up your skin it
looks like you have nothing on your skin
yet still has amazing
I will literally never go back to any
other banana shade I'm using this one so
I'm just sitting at that with a Real
Techniques contour brush you guys
guessed it to set the rest of my face
I'm taking my Australis fresh and
flawless pressed powder a v-shape it's
office brown and just patting this
lightly over my skin I still won the
doing is to peek through so I'm not
going to do this too heavy and moving on
to contouring I'm going to consult with
Michael at benefit bronze up so I'm just
contouring my cheekbones my jawline my
forehead and my nose I stopped using
this a bronze on for a while and I used
my nature one and I really regret it
even though I love my nation a bronzer
this by fog will forever be my favorite
bronzer it is just sorry natural looking
and I seriously love it
now I'm going to bronze up my chips with
the model stripper soft touch blush in D
shade it glows through now I spoke about
this blush in my February favourites so
I'm so excited to show you guys so I'm
just applying this to my cheeks and this
seriously gives the most gorgeous like
bronzed glow to the skin to warm up my
crease I'm taking the warm brown shade
in the Ellis and Jade contour palette
now for this step I really use any warm
brown shade it doesn't really matter
what when I use I just kind of use
what's in front of me so today I just
used this one so that's what my dress on
my eyes I just apply a warm brown
eyeshadow in the crease just taking my
eyes a little bit more depth and yes
and I also like to apply this along my
lower lash line as well I like to
highlight my brow bone with any matte
white or light matte vanilla shade so
for today I'm just using the one in the
Alice and jake onson kit to keep it easy
for you guys but I also love white lies
by makeup geek I will forever love a
strong inner corner highlight so I'm
taking at the makeup geek pigment in the
shades optical area and just applying
this to my inner corners very intense
because I just find it makes your eyes
look more awake for mascara I'm going to
be using the benefit roller lash and
just putting one coat of this through my
top and bottom lashes because I want to
show you guys a little trick that I have
so then I go in with a clear brow gel
oxley a mascara whatever you have and I
just apply this over the mascara because
it makes my lashes look so much more
longer and thicker and darker I like
doing this personally because I don't
like wearing much mascara because I hate
taking it off and I hate the feel of it
so this just makes your lashes look so
much more longer and thicker without
applying too much mascara and making it
go chunky
now I'm going to intensely highlight my
face with the hourglass luminous light
highlights ah so I just apply this to my
cheeks the tip of my nose the bridge of
my nose above my brow Moreno my forehead
on my Cupid's bow area I just like to
apply this everywhere because I love the
glory it gives it gives such a natural
glory and it makes my skin look so dewy
and fresh
and now the last step is lips so foolish
I really alternate between tree I
alternate between Mac naturally
transformed or Mac plastic and sometimes
I will use Mac velvet teddy but today
I'm going to be using Mac plastic pull
matte lipstick in straight past and this
is a frost finish so this has been most
gorgeous finish to it
I love how like glittery and Galli it
looks and I just think it's so beautiful
and that is the makeup look I tend to
lean towards on a daily basis so this is
the completed makeup look I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and if you did
please don't forget to give this massive
this massive video I tend to say that
all the time

pretty and I'll see piercings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
