today I have known as my everyday makeup
routine I wore this in my last video
which was my very favorites and this
makeup look got so many requests so i
thought i would film all for you guys i
thought i would film all for you guys so
i thought i would film up for you guys
today it's just very natural and glowy
and fresh so if you guys would like to
see how i wear my makeup on a daily
basis then please keep watching so for
foundation i've been using the
maybelline fit me Julian Smith
foundation now i'm sure many of you guys
know that i love the matte poreless
foundation but i decided to pick this
one up and give it a go and i've been
loving it I naturally have really oily
skin so I would never do a Joey finish
to a makeup look but this one just makes
my skin not oily at all it has amazing
coverage and lasts so long so I've been
loving the look of this one for
concealer I love using the L'Oreal True
Match concealer in the shade vanilla and
I just apply this on to my eyes down my
nose on my chin and on my forehead to
highlight and I blend that out with the
tip of a damp Beauty Blender now this
concealer is seriously my favorite
concealer in the world it is better than
any high-end concealer I've ever used
the coverage of it is amazing it's so
light on the skin yet still has full
coverage it looks so flawless on the
skin once it's blended out so if you are
looking for a fairly cheap and concealer
I would definitely recommend giving this
one to grow because it is just heaven to
set the places i concealed and
highlighted i'm taking what's left of
the banana shade in the Alison Jade
contour kit I am so sad this is running
out because this is the best banana
shade I've ever used in my life it is so
fine and it doesn't take up your skin it
looks like you have nothing on your skin
guys do
amazing coverage I will literally never
go back to any other banana shade after
using this one so I'm just studying at
that with a Real Techniques contour
brush you guys guessed it to set the
rest of my face I'm taking my australis
fresh and flawless press powder English
a the darkest brown and just padding
this lightly over my skin as to when the
doing is to pick through so i'm not
going to do this too heavy and moving on
to contouring i'm going to consult with
michael a benefit bronzer so I'm just
contouring my cheekbones my jawline my
forehead and my nose I stopped using
this bronzer for a while and i use my
nature one and i really regret it even
though i love my nature a bronzer this
by far will forever be my favorite
bronzer it is just so natural looking
and i seriously love it
now i'm going to bronze up my cheeks
with the models prefer soft touch blush
in shade it glow through now I spoke
about this blush in my febrero favorite
so I'm so excited to show you guys so
I'm just applying this to my cheeks and
this seriously gives the most gorgeous
like bronze glow to the skin to warm up
Mike Reiss I'm taking the warm brown
shade in the Ellison Jade contour
palette now for this step I really use
any warm brown shade it doesn't really
matter what when i use i just kind of
use what's in front of me so today i
just use this one so that's all i drew
for my eyes I just apply a warm brown
eyeshadow in the crease just taking my
eyes a little bit more depth and yes
and I also like to apply this along my
lower lash line as well I like to
highlight my brother in with any matt
white or light matte vanilla shade so
for today I'm just using the one in the
Alison Drakon take it to keep it easy
for you guys but it also love white lies
by makeup geek I will forever love a
strong inner corner highlight so I'm
taking it the makeup geek pigment in the
shades after Gloria and just apply this
to my inner corners very intense because
i just find it makes your eyes look more
awake for mascara i'm going to be using
the benefit roller lash and just putting
one coat of this to my top and bottom
lashes because i want to show you guys a
little trick that I have
so then I go in with a clear brow gel or
clear mascara whatever you have and I
just apply this over the mascara because
it makes my lashes look so much more
longer and thicker and darker I like
doing this personally because I don't
like wearing much mascara because I hate
taking it off and I hate the feel of it
so this just makes your lashes look so
much more longer and thicker without
applying too much mascara and making it
go chunky
you
now i'm going to intensely highlight my
face with the hourglass luminous light
highlights are so i just apply this to
my cheeks the tip of my nose the bridge
of my nose above my brow bone or my
forehead when I cupids bow I just like
to apply this everywhere because i love
the gloria gives it such a natural glory
and it makes my skin look so dewy and
fresh
another last step is lips so college I
really alternate between three i
alternate between mac naturally
transformed or mac plastic and sometimes
i will use mac velvet teddy but today
i'm going to be using mac plastic pull
mac lipstick in the shade plastic and
this is a frost finish so this has the
most gorgeous finish to it i love how
like glittery and galliot looks and i
just think it's so beautiful and that is
the makeup look i tend to lean towards
on a daily basis so this is a complete
and makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you did please don't
forget to give this massive this massive
video I tend to say that all the time
