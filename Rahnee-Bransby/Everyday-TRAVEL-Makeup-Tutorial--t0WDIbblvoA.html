my channel so right now I just want to
scream and shout because I'm gonna pick
it at the moment and it seriously
sorry freaking beautiful yeah oh my
goodness it is seriously so amazing I
like in heaven right now so because I'm
planning right now I thought I would
feel my everyday Mitch probable makeup
routine you guys just you can't then you
guys going to our link soon any I don't
want to get an idea of what makeups well
alright just let me see how I wear my
makeup when I travel because I'm in
Thailand for the moment is very hot and
humid and sticky so I don't like to wear
a lot I just like to be very aggressive
glowing so I guess if I was in Europe
and it was raining it would be different
yeah I really hope you guys enjoy and
let's jump into it I'm too excited to be
a customer right now but let's go
sorry I beat my hotel room at the moment
I got my word on it's 9 o'clock in the
morning and I'm going to get ready but
what was jumping so I just wanna quickly
show you guys that might be because is
it's breathtaking is there see insane so
have a look so the bathroom is here and
that's halfway there and there is the
ocean like what Java actually you guys
my amazing video I'm going to get on
into the makeup start setting out with
primer
to face we have a pie mom I would like
Crimea's sorry important to do when
you're on holidays especially if you're
a nut chocolate in place and you're
going to be sweating off this one is my
absolute favorite primer because there's
no image as a prime the skin and makes
makeup stare manga is sort of oyster
izing like it feels like a moisturizer
in the Python and it smells like coconut
as well so what's not to love my hair is
so frizzy oh my goodness weather and the
pool is just don't like my hair so the
primer has made all my blemishes and
dark circles appear so let's quickly
move on to the foundation the foundation
I like to use when I'm traveling
especially in the really hard humid age
is a unique manner of touch foundation
that this stuff is amazing
like you have nothing on the skin like
it doesn't even feel like a cream it
just feels like you have not the onion
skin and so also looks like it has to
delight coverage but actually has full
coverage it just doesn't feel like full
coverage like this foundation is my
number one favorite it is incredible it
smells amazing
looked amazing sorry I can't stop
looking at the state I just keep looking
everybody I'm sorry when I'm on holiday
I'd like to apply this foundation with a
brush this is me so we must still finish
um buff abroad is is the fastest and
easiest way to apply this foundation I
literally keep doing it like a second so
I usually just apply it to your job so I
got my brush to see that and you guys
watch sorry
so that is how much foundation I use I
just used for tiny drugs and it does my
full face which I absolutely love
moving on to concealer I like to see too
much concealer in the shade 3 when I'm
on holiday I don't like to have a lot of
coverage or a lot of products on my face
so I usually just apply a tiny bit of
this onto my eyes and down the bridge of
my nose just to conceal the darkness
under my eyes because on holiday I get
really tired because I don't sleep much
and just down the center of my nose just
to kind of even out once again this
concealer is amazing it is very thin it
is kind of like watery but the coverage
of it is amazing like it has full
coverage for the consistency of it that
makes sense and it doesn't feel like you
have a lot of products on your face
either which I love
the turnout would be on to setting the
base I just like to take my Alison
deyette contour palette and I usually
like to take this banana shake here I
don't really like to set the rest of my
face just because I don't really feel
like putting as I said before a lot of
product onto my face so I'm just set
onto my eyes and down the bridge of my
nose moving on to your bronzing and
contouring whenever I'm on holiday I
love doing like an intense bronzy glow a
look so if you're conjuring I like to
keep the contrary actually quite simple
and then go hard with the bronzer so to
contour I'm just taking my out some
contour palette again and I'm taking at
least through choice yeah I'm mixing
them together and I'm just going to
lightly contour my cheekbones and down
the bridge of my nose and that is a
pretty much all that contour I just do
it very very lightly
Brady just got all excited because while
I'm filming he's watching something
while sitting in the pool outside he's
like oh yeah I'm using the - 3d Egyptian
clay bronzer I absolutely love this
front sight is seriously true typo so I
like to focus the bronzer just on my
cheeks as a blush and also onto my
forehead as well
I usually just focus on using these two
shades here so yeah
to be on to browse because my brows
offends attachment I'm not usually just
on that brow gel for you or something
but if I want them a little bit more
defined I will be eliminating it with a
brow powder now now the other day I
actually did this and it works amazing
so the thing I've been loving at the
moment is taking at this shape here
which is kind of like an Ashley cool
tones Brown and I like to use this in my
brows see it actually doesn't look that
bad you just want like a little bit more
of a defined look if it was something I
just slightly went ahead and filled in
my brows with my console palette I'm
going to be taking at the Loreal brow
auto company in the shade blunt and just
running this through my brows
moving on to the eyes for this video or
anything I was going to put on mascara
and just say I wear a little bit of
mascara but then I would be lying to you
guys being completely honest I don't
wear and mascara or anything on my eyes
when I travel this because I hurt me
like the feel of mascara on my eyes in
general so I'm when I traveling or when
I mean really hot heat I just don't want
it there and I don't want it to be
running and stuff so I put my eyes I
don't do any crazy eyeshadow I don't
wear mascara or eyeliner or lashes or
anything like that
and she just take my or bronzer again
and just run through the bronze through
my crease on my lower lash line and
that's pretty much all I do for my eyes
so I usually just take these two colors
here again and then just run it through
my crease
now moving on to how to get my stuff
that really sum up intense blurt I'm
going to do you think the Ifrah you
Jimmy highlight out this is by far my
favorite holiday in the world it is a
very like soft golden tones and golden
tones of my absolute favorite especially
in highlighters this my thought is the
best highlighter I've ever used and it
is super portable as well I just have to
brush in there ones and look how crazy
this is ready oh my lord
and after the very last step which is
slips when I'm on holiday I don't like
wearing lipstick unless I'm going out
but you know I'll going somewhere really
like I don't know dressy so I usually
just like to to apply a moisturizing lip
balm or the Lucas purple even I feel
like this is only in sterling product is
it do I have this in America or anywhere
else in the world I'm not sure so this
is my everyday travel makeup routine in
the morning it would roughly take me
about five to ten minutes if I'm not
just an adapter looking it's really
about half an hour today so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you

mustard thumbs up and subscribe if
