the world is going crazy that was called
hey guys it's Ronnie and welcome back so
today I have filmed a February
favourites for you all I know how much
you guys love my favourites videos so I
thought I would do one for this month
I'm really starting to sound a bit crazy
or my nose sounds blocked or my voice
tends to leave the room I'm in sick at
the moment but I still wanted to film
for you guys so just ignore that so if
you guys would like to see what I've
been loving for the month of February
please keep watching and let's run
straight into my first favorite for the
month of January January wearing about
very Ronnie so my first favorite for the
month of February is definitely my
number one favorite things that I've
been loving this month and that is the
iPhone 6s in gold now if you follow me
on snapchat you will definitely know
what happened to my phone I was out
clubbing and I dropped my phone and you
know when you drop your phone and it
still works but the crooks scream like
gross all those weird colors that's what
happened to it and my phone has been
through hell it has broken about five
times and it's always fixed itself
it lost its sound at one point and ended
up fixing itself it's screen was
completely black at one point ended up
fixing itself sorry I think it was a
universe telling me it's time can you
find in a way I'm sorry happy it broke
because I ended up getting a new phone I
got the iPhone 6s in gold I was going to
get it in rose gold but I thought the
rose gold was true pink for my likings
only thing I thought about is I played
candy crush soda and also in level 389
and when my favorite I couldn't connect
it to my candy crush to my Facebook
sorry come back another one and I'm most
art obsessed with my background I think
it's so cute
my next favorite is a lipstick and this
is a frost finish lipstick by Mac in the
shade plastic I certainly think frost
finish lip sweets are making a comeback
a lot of older ladies tend to lean
towards a more than younger girls but
I'm actually obsessive and this is CFS
one eyes
button and I want to buy the whole
collection of cross finish back home
across finish because I kind of have
like a frosty shimmery glittery finish
to them I have it on today and I just
assess with the look it gives I
definitely prefer the first ever matte
lately it is just so unique and gives
such a gorgeous like she literally look
to the lips
my name is favorite is the blush and it
is by the brand motors from fat this is
that mineral powder soft touch blush in
the shade light one I blend all the
colors together and a fight to the
apples of my cheeks and it just gives me
more school just like one see like glowy
fresh look to the skin this is right up
my alley I just can't even begin to
express how much love I have for it it
just makes my skin look so glowy and
healthy well sorry how in the chain glow
one I don't use this one as much because
I prefer my broadens trance eyes on my
pinky tones but yet again this is just
so amazing and when I do use it it looks
gorgeous my next layer is a bit of a
weird one but it is a Beauty Blender
excuse how heavy it is I just use it for
those to clean up I'm sure everyone's
beauty blenders look like this SPD blend
it-it's by the branch AG and the reason
I love this beauty blender so much is
because it has a flat surface but when I
saw Beauty black just like this I always
looked away from them because I thought
they were like a cheetah knockoff for a
beauty blender I decided to give this
one a go because chichis sent me a bunch
of their different shaped Beauty
blenders I can honestly say this is the
best and most helpful beautiful eyes
I've ever used in my life I think the
fact that it has a flat surface makes it
so much easier to blend out makeup and
just gives more of a flawless look and I
went out forever be thankful for the
Beauty blenders that have the flat
surface my next favorite is a pop game
now I actually spoke about this in my
birthday whole because I got it for my
birthday this is the packing poem by
Lancome
in that video I said how amazing this is
and honestly this is the best smelling
perfume I've ever smelled in my life
this perfume is so so strong so if you
don't like strong perfumes I suggest
stay away from it
I don't really explain what smell is
it's very floral but it's also very
musky at the same time but it is just it
is amazing my next favorite is a pair of
sunglasses now I have been wearing these
in seriously
a further ad posted on the Instagram
lately because they had just started
cool and unique and they just go into
every school outfit say they are these
Sunny's you know I'm sure you guys could
guess that they would be these studies
his son is not by the brand info and
they were a collaboration with I really
just have a clear crystal frame with
dark grey lenses and they it seriously
so cool I have been wearing them all the
time these are like the early Sony's
that I can wear for a long period of
time and drive with them on because my
name is funny is I usually let them meet
fighters and then I'll put them on my
head because I know I've never been a
person that can wear Sony's for a long
time because I just think they're
uncomfortable and I'd really like the
fact that I can't see out the corner of
my eye the sight the frame is that but
these are seriously like I know I can
just see everything the next favorite I
have to share with you guys is also
another thing that was in my birthday
haul and it is a purse by brand status
now my best friend Jenna got me this for
my birthday and I am obsessed with this
first of all the pattern and feel of it
is amazing things the thing I love asked
Alan Wallace is the size of them very
small but they're not overly big the
voice is the fact that I can fit my
Invisalign case in it because when I go
out to eat or whatever usually my case
very much of my intellect doesn't feel
my purse because I had a main purpose
before and the fact that it can fit in
this just makes me so happy but and the
fact that it is lovely print makes me so
happy my next favorite is a top that I'm
wearing I want this to cast away music
festival to make summer's here is a
photo of it on I got so many compliments
on this shirt especially at the festival
itself so really looking what's inside
your shirt is amazing and that I look
like a mermaid and that's definitely
what I was going for this is might be my
stunning shirt I've ever seen in my life
the color of it is so beautiful I'm
amazing at the beach and just swimming
in the water
Arriflex like blurry and brains and they
are like my favorite colors at the
moment this shot is from homage okay I
never know how to pronounce it I'm
pretty sure it's homage I'll leave a
link to it below the lady that runs that
store is so kind she sent me this shirt
for castaway she is the most gorgeous
beautiful lady I've ever sweated to in
my life please go check out her
Instagram and her story give her some
love
she is just so beautiful and her clothes
are amazing
and yeah the next thing I have been
loving is necklaces cerveza soy
necklaces seriously the latest trend at
the moment sorry I actually have one
here which I made sorry I made this the
other day with Shanae my best friend so
we just went to spotlight and bought
some suede and tools and feathers and
stuff and made a bunch of them this one
I have here is my favorite it is just a
black faux suede net place and I've
attached some beads at the bottom and
also added some feathers and I also
wanted to add feathers for this one just
because it kind of gives that really
cute boy heard like vibe to it and I
really love it
I definitely think if you want to get
one of these definitely go to your local
craft store and pick up some suede and
jewels and stuff and make your own
because a is so simple and so easy to
make and you can buy them from booties
but they sell them for about $30 when
you can make them for $5 so I definitely
think doing a little DIY and making your
own other than buying it and spending
about thirty dollars on something that
is so cheap to me sorry my next favorite
is a song now this song came out I think
in 2010 it's been around for a very long
time but it is such a good song song it
puts me in such a good mood whenever I
hear it it is my Florence and the
Machine and it is code twelve days on
our ball whenever I hear and I just I
didn't even Dori I just it just puts me
in the best mood and I like appreciate
everything if that makes sense
like I'm so thankful by everything when
I hear it it just puts me in such a been
married in these knees so many feels and
I'm obsessed with it and the chorus just
leaves them speechless it's just like
oh good and my last favorite that I have
to share with you guys is a youtuber
now I like to incorporate a youtuber or
Instagram profile in my favorite videos
as much as I can just so you guys can
find like a new favorite youtuber or
someone to follow it or something like
that so this month and the past like two
months since I discovered her I've been
obsessed with her but this month
especially her name is simply cannot now
she is an american youtuber and she is
just the cutest little thing i have ever
seen in my life i'm obsessed with her
her voice is adorable her face is
adorable she is so cute and her
instagram i'm looking at at the moment
her instagram is just like amazing like
the theme of it she is so creative she
is the one that i just covered how to
make these necklaces from her video is
the way that edited just the way they
put together the way she talks
everything is just amazing the song she
uses she is obsessed with cactuses like
myself
she is just put so much time and effort
into our videos she is seriously like my
instagram and youtube is very like the
past to make side no I have had no
motivation to film videos I'm not sure
if you guys have noticed I haven't
posted as much as I would I don't know I
just didn't have enough motivation to
film I thought I had enough motivation
to edit but just not feelings after
watching her video and she just gives me
so much more inspiration and motivation
