and then I heard this voice behind me
great attention and Shaunie's apartment
building decided to start doing
firehouses testing so now that this
voice that keeps going test one two
sorry I'm going to try push through and
see how much I can do without that being
annoying he kind of keeps cutting me off
and it keeps going to like every ten
seconds but we will work with it as it's
ronnie and welcome back to my channel
hunter so today I decided to film April
face only using elf makeup I've seen
this video to the rounds on YouTube and
I love the idea of banking a portable
makeup work and seeing how it works
sorry I've got a bunch of our products
in front of me and I'm going to try them
all out and I'm going to use only elf on
my face also if you're new I would love
you to subscribe and join family we're
almost at 100k that is honestly so
inside I'm going to start out by priming
the skin with the elf hydrating face
primer when I read a hydrating face
timer I thought this was going to be
like a moisturizing face primer but this
is a lot like the benefit Porefessional
and I
maybe Nancy foundation I'm going to
using the elf oil-free foundation in the
shade above now I was actually reading
the directions on the back of this
foundation and as L say to reapply every
three hours so I don't really like the
idea of that but we're going to see how
it's are you
it is um I also have this Elvis
Foundation serum I have one in two
shades fair light and one in the shade
light/medium so I might take the sale
light one and try to mix it in with your
foundation just to see if we can make
the color a little bit less because it
does look extremely dark for my skin
tone so hopefully and I'm just going to
use my beauty blender to blend that into
my skin Shawny are made me bill bill
shiny made me buy a real beauty blender
now that I'm staying with her and it has
honestly changed my life like if you
don't have a real beauty blender you
have to get one because they are so so
good so that is half my face with one
layer foundation and I'm going to lay
the coverage it's actually really really
nice and it's super nice on the skin as
well I mean
moving on to concealer I have a few
different concealers here so I'm just
going to take the original elf concealer
in the shade light and apply this on my
eyes and down the bridge of my nose to
highlight so hopefully this is light
enough to highlight here that is
literally the same color as my skin tone
it is brightening up your under eyes a
little bit it just doesn't have a lot of
coverage so maybe this would be good if
you just want to feel like coverage
concealer but I mean I always felt like
full intense high coverage concealers
under my eyes because my bags of SARS
are now I'm going to lightly set and
bake onto the eyes with this elf sheer
transparent powder this is so tiny in
the packaging
to set the rest of the face I have the
elf finishing a paddle of the elephant
press powder so I might give the press
powder to go just because usually when I
set my face I use the pressed paddles
independence almost looks a little bit
green but I'm sure that's me just being
like colorblind or something a little
bit stop so I do find that press pada a
little bit patchy but I guess we can
work with it so now I'm going to take
the elf sunkissed glow bronzer and I'm
going to lightly bronze up my face now
I'm just going to take this elf golden a
bronzing palette Oh Harris slap on liner
and just blends all the shades together
and apply it onto my cheeks and the
outer parts of my face just to drugs up
the skin a little bit more I'm going to
take the blush and apply it to my cheeks
I'm a little bit scared because this
color does look a little bit frightening
so yes
by now that my face is almost finished
I'm just going to message winner now the
face is almost finished
I'm lastly going to highlight with the
elf with the elf moonlight pearls
highlighter now I just see Geoffrey
style make a video on this and he said
he loves it I'm pretty sure so I'm
really excited to see how this goes
whoa oh my goodness for a free dollar
highlighter that is absolutely stunning
now moving on to brows I'm going to take
the elf I don't know why I keep saying
else because this is an elf full ways of
makeup but the elf eyebrow quad
initiated medium and this has a gel and
a powder in it sorry I think I'm going
to start off with the gel and then go in
with the powder and I think I'm going to
assume you guys in a little bit closer
as well just so you can get a better
look of how the eyes and the eyebrows
just so you can get a better look of how
the eyes on the eyebrows turn out now
that your close and personal you can
probably see everything that's going on
I mean the nurse contour is been amazing
but everything else went pretty well
especially the highlight
not for you Retta how are you doing it
I'm just every time he sleeps I just
want to stop and start again but I mean
I'm doing fine so I was taught something
like so now and we lose and then I go
slow down maybe on scoot and I quickly
try play a little first star reversed oh
I just forgot to turn the microphone on
lucky I remembered because I haven't
done much all I said was I'm moving on
to eyes and I'm very using the prism elf
eyeshadow palette the shades in this
palette is absolutely stunning but all
the shades of shimmery so I am just
taking the elf bronzer and blush vampire
and I'm just taking the bronzer and
blending that through my crease as my
transition shade
now the lid I'm going to be picking this
shape yeah this is just like a light
peachy gold it's actually a really nice
color story I'm going to apply that all
over the lid
I have really subsidized so the moment
that eyeshadow gets in my eye I'm just
like whoa I'm now just going to go ahead
and jump off camera and apply some
falsies and I will be right back
sorry I just went ahead and applied some
hot flashes and now I'm just going to
take it the shake here in the palette
and apply that on my inner corners just
to highlight and open the eyes up a
little bit more and I may be on TV very
last step which is lip I'm going to
using the elf blushing words over to
lipstick and I'm just going to pop her
off and apply these to my lid apply
these apply this to my lou and my
lipstick is fine
and one last step I almost forgot I'm
just going to take the elf makeup mist
and setting spray and I'm going to spray
my face just to love this makeup in all
days so it doesn't slide around I think
this makeup look would be really good as
and everyday at neutral makeup looks so
