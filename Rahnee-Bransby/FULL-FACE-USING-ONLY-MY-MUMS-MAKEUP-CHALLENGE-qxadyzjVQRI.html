back to my channel before we get into
the living area I just want to quickly
do a little disclaimer I'm quite sick at
the moment as you can probably tell by
my voice I sound really blocked up and
like Corky's third please excuse us so
today I'm doing my first ever challenge
of the area my good friend of Michael
Finch actually posted this video
yesterday and I thought it was so
hilarious and I thought would be so much
fun to film us so I had to film it I
laid his link to my if you wanna go
check that out but today I'm going to be
filming the full face using only my
mum's and makeup challenge I am so
excited to see how this is going to turn
out because when I also know if I could
have all the pur makeup and she gave me
her makeup bag I had a little strip
through it and I'm not gonna lie she has
about ten makeup products and I use more
than ten throat's just to do my face so
but she does have about fifty eyeshadow
quads
I think I'll be fine with eyeshadow but
I'm not too sure on how everything else
is going to go oh sorry I'm featuring a
special guest in today's video um I met
you about three days ago and now he
won't leave me alone
yeah I'd like to introduce you to
probably the biggest people you'll ever
meet in your life so here in my mom's
beautiful makeup bag here let someone
sleep inside she literally has about 12
makeup products I'm not even joking then
she gave me these things which have
brushes in but she has about four
brushes and 500 eyeliners
and surprisingly she doesn't have a
foundation brush so I'm guessing she
uses her hands to put her foundation on
which scares the freak
hell out of me so I'm just going to use
my BB legs of today because no way shape
or form am i putting foundation on with
my husband so everyone just not a freak
private this is weird I didn't even
think she are in Japan MA
but this is the love's fabulous finish
primer I've never heard of this brand in
my life so let's see how it goes this
practice or not I'm not going to lie I
actually really enjoyed that primer
first so nice and maybe on some
foundation she actually has true
foundations so she has the Maybelline
Julie and Smith foundation which I'm not
going to use today because I have this
myself Ashley also has the Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation which I tried
house sorry I'm going to use this one
today and this is in the shade of Tony
by the way my mom is like 5 shades
darker than me so I don't think this is
going to match at all and I have no feet
turn on at the moment
sorry I think I might actually have to
get this foundation for myself I
freaking love it now I know why everyone
raves about it I actually have obsessed
with it talk until if she uses the
Maybelline instant age rewind in the
shade medium how the hell am I supposed
to highlight my under eyes this can you
guys people see that concealer is
literally the same shade that's the
foundation
maybe I'll sweep out up my mom uses the
Maybelline New York shine free loose
powder and what do you know it's in the
show you got medium again so I have no
idea how I'm going to highlight my under
eyes with tears and to be honest can you
guys see that there's literally nothing
left there is nothing left in this at
all
mom you have no power left okay the day
has been saved
she just gave me please Ruolin too much
confection transparent at least powder
she said that she bought this too just
yesterday because this one is on its
last legs but this one I can at least
make the under eyes me
now I'm just taking a tiny bit of these
pallets to set the rest of my face maybe
on to brows I found it's free brow
products so at first we have the Rimmel
London eyebrow pencil in the shade
darkest Brown and the the reading curry
which never Brown this is brush on brow
in the shade of taupe which is mostly
looks like a black shade that these were
sorry too to be honest I don't even
think this has been use I'm scared for
my life that has the merciful that I've
ever seen in my life and it's not even
on my brows
and my mom doesn't have a brow gel so
we're just going to have to leave them
and hope that they don't like fly off or
something maybe not to contour I'm
surprised my mom even has a bronzer but
I don't even think it's being touched to
be honest but it is the Rimmel London
that Sun shimmer mattifying bronzer in
light and I'm just using this makeup
Academy f6 contour brush which I think
she uses for blush maybe as a blush this
one actually scares me because you'll
see but I'm taking the Endre and makeup
Academy blush in the shade English Rose
this blush is purple I don't know if you
guys can say that I'll give you a
close-up can you see that this blush is
freaking cool to be honest I'm scared on
my life to see what color this will be
on my cheeks but she seems to love it
she's hit pads
it honestly looks like I did it honestly
looks like I dip my brush in like white
glitter or white shimmer and I just won
I mean it doesn't give a bad blow but
let's just try to blend that out a
little bit blend what out there's
nothing even there now let's move on to
the eyes so first we have the cheating
natural eyes eye shadow palette which
she actually stole off me I let her go
at one time and now I guess she was
close with his parole then she has these
for covergirl quads which and love the
look of this one it's just like gold so
I'll use that one and then she has these
two Rimmel London quads which one is
bright purple and I'm not gonna lash is
actually use the purple either you
girlfriend sorry mom that did not break
I'm gonna use the bronzer in my crease
as my transition shade is his Jesus hell
woman
these brushes these brushes are just
stiff picture anything move I'm going to
take this little covergirl quad in the
shade notice my needs and I'm taking
this brown shade here and if you can
even see that at the end I'm just going
to work that into my outer V and crease
now I'm taking the other covergirl quad
in the shade going for gold and I'm
going to use this brush a cotton now I'm
just going to say it is super vibrant
golf shade and now I actually really
heard this works because the shade looks
so beautiful
going in with the darkest brown shade in
the quad and I'm going to blend that on
the outer V just to kind of darken up a
little bit
now I'm taking that little brush again
and using that same it's a brown shade
along my lower lash line
now going in with the shade I'm going to
highlight my inner corners maybe onto
mascara I'm not vouching to my mom since
car but I don't have the same one in my
collection so this is the Rimmel London
at one to fool scar with argan oil and
my mom doesn't wear lashes in us or for
the purpose of this video I'm not going
to apply lashes just going to use a new
mascara
maybe I'm so hot my mom actually doesn't
use a highlighter sorry I'm going to
take this chance my highlight up now
moving on to the last step which is
lipstick all of these shades of that my
mom owned I read every single show you
pretty much also all of my mom's
lipsticks they're all a round I don't
know why it's go around by there all the
bullets oh my goodness that oh my
goodness
I kid you not guys I'm going to take a
photo right now of how that lipstick
lied to ignore my fluffy socks but I'm
gonna insert that oh my god what are the
chances of it landing like that kind of
busted the bullet but what the hell Andy
pretty so this isn't a way to make up
look I really hope you guys enjoyed it I
had so much fun filming this video and
testing out my mom's makeup some of it
or not that amazing but some of it I
will give it to her so if you guys
