back to my channel so today I'm going to
be filming the very famous full face for
making all i'ma keep doing that so today
I'm going to be filming a big it very
well-known full face of making literally
I've done this five times now and I
kissing full face for making the full
face with makeup using props I hate I am
so excited on this video because
I love these videos I find them story
entertaining and sort of hilarious they
always turn out so funny so I'm really
excited to see how much themselves also
if you're new to my channel I'm Ronnie
and I would love you guys to subscribe
we're almost at 100k and that is
honestly so crazy so don't forget to
subscribe just before I do jump into it
I just want to do a quick little
disclaimer
by all means I'm not fashioning brands
of makeup that I'm going to be using
pretty much all of these brands that I'm
using I freaking love and adore and have
so many thoughts from them that I love
but some of the points I have just don't
work for me and with that being said as
well if any of these products work for
you that is amazing I meant started
happy for you I wish I were for me
because I wasted my money but please
like offended is any of the products I'm
using working and I do I work for me
it's just personal preference with this
little stuff and we all have different
skin types I'm going to like different
things so yeah I really hope you guys
enjoy this video and let's jump straight
to have a little sip of water before we
get included because I actually know
those I'm stressed so I actually don't
have a primer that I don't live so we're
moving straight on to foundation I'm
going to be using the benefit hello
flawless oxygen Wow foundation now I
should also say some of these products I
am using not because I hate them just
because I'm an idiot and I picked up the
wrong shade and they completely
completely difference to my skin tone so
just being one of them I don't know what
I was thinking this is so orange is
actually crazy but I know so many people
that use it foundation and love it and I
wish I just wish I got it in my color
I've just put on a fresh straight turn
so this might actually it not it's
definitely my mint it's way too orange
so you hate it when you have to live at
PQ foundation online so you're getting
it from online and you keep the complete
wrong Shay that's exactly what Isis with
this foundation like what is actually
wrong with me
what make me look at the shade and go oh
that's eventually perfectly oh my god
the mailman tonight's shocking has an
iron face oh my god he's gonna be like
what the is wrong if you can
honestly say I've never been so nervous
to answer the door
I like to open the door he was like hi
hums like Hello but she has to say in
person because in person it is just so
much less than what actually is cool
moving on to concealer I feel really
really bad because so far I just use
benefit products and I freaking love
benefit than swearing for that sale I'm
going to be using the boying a concealer
by jennifer first of all I hate the
packaging on this I don't get it but you
have to use your fingers to apply our
brush I just really don't like the
packaging and the way you have to apply
the concealer I find it really unhygenic
and second of all this is so sick I hate
the concealers and honestly it's like
when I throw my finger in there it is
honestly top like it is very very hard I
find it so thick when Isis uses for how
thick it is it doesn't have very high
coverage I didn't like it it settled
into all my fine lines on my eyes so I'm
just going to use a brush and apply this
under my eyes I just really really hated
the packaging on this I think it is
sorry inconvenient and unhygienic as
well because if you're using your finger
sticking your finger into this every
single day especially if your hands
aren't clean it's going to close
bacteria and it's going to cause like
blemishes and stuff I got through
considering how state this concealer is
I find it made my dark circles like
stand out even more than covers there's
Christmas by weird because it is a
really sick concealer but something just
aren't meant to be yeah shut up
actually that was Justin Bieber sir
petitioner moving on to exciting under
the eyes this is a product that was very
very popular in Australia and I think
they also sell it in New Zealand I'm not
too sure but this was pretty much to be
first console palette that came out in
Australia business there was the anasazi
as well Lincoln Ilana that was other
times very very hard to get your hands
on if you from Australia so this is the
Australia's AC onto a contouring and
highlighting palette I know a lot of
people love this I even liked it when it
first came out because I didn't know any
better so if you love is I don't mean to
offend you at all I personally just
don't like it and as you can see I just
love this because I have used quite a
lot of it
the reason why I hate this is because
the powders a source or chalky quickly
my can repeat that out but the powers of
source or chalky they're so powdery it
is still very very dry and chalky also
the banana shade is literally yellowed
now in annotates aren't exactly yellow
they just look yellow but they soar
around your face yellow this is
literally like a yellow eyeshadow and
then the highlighted shade is also pink
as well which is really weird like just
going to take a yellow shade oh my god
can you guys see that with my hands oh
look at that
it's literally all over my fingers yuck
oh my god this is a brand new like $300
pop oh my god I love my life I'm just
going to take that onto my eyes
it honestly looks like I'm trying to
bait my eyes now to set the rest of my
face to match my beautiful gorgeous
orange of foundation I'm going to using
the hello flawless benefit powder in
exact same shade and this is honestly
once again like bright orange I wish I
got this in my shade because I hear so
many people rave about how much they
love it and I know Shani absolutely
loves the cheese's all the time so I'm
just going to set the rest of my face
why I didn't use the banana powder try
pickets on my neck so much looser I'm
not matching it to anything why does it
look like I have an orange being right
now looks like I have a really really
bad sunglasses like 10 you know many
people like tanning with no sunglasses
on that's what I look like
there is one thing I can say that is bad
about this palette would ensure every
single person in the world agrees with
me is that the console shades the
coloring is sort of they are so
intensely pigmented you can't even get a
really soft nice contour with them
because they are that intense actually
going since my brush in there like that
the tiny little bit and even going to
blue because I actually want to try make
it look good okay
do you know what I forget either
that isn't even brown that is literally
like a dark gray what the is this
in my head I honestly thought this was
going to work until I use that powder
that was one of my hopes went out the
window because I don't want to gray nose
I just want to use this shape here to
try lightly contour my nose
moving on to bronzing up the face and
wisely taking the ambient light
additionnal glass palette absolutely
love the blushes in this palette and oh
so beautiful something I just don't
understand is this is the bronzer shade
tra and it's literally I don't if I'm
using it wrong or what is literally
called a bronzer business honestly
lesser than my foundation maybe it's
just not made for my complexion or it's
not actually bump that I don't know I
just when I see the word bronzer I ask
you it's two runs up the cheek but I
honestly didn't even need to bronze up
my face because my face is friends
enough with this foundation color now
moving on to highlight out when I got
this I don't sort of story excited
because it looks awesome I was so glad
to use it and it just didn't live up to
my expectations so this is we advocate
naked illuminated trio does about use
them and swatch them and I was so
disappointed honestly can you guys even
see anything on my hand
they are so powdery and Scioscia and
they literally like there's nothing
there
especially the gold I was so excited to
the gold and like it honestly as well
have like no color to it it is just a
little like specks of glitter which is
so strange now that the base is done and
I'm looking absolutely stunning I'm
going to move on to the eyebrows so
moving on to brows I'm going to using
the Chaffee brow
made in the shade stops brown if you out
from friendly out you probably
veterinary what is Brent is because it
is an Australian based on draw children
this is a brothel made and I go to in
three different shades I think I got
blood soft brown and medium brown and I
know so many people that love this I had
a lot of friends by using I actually
gave this to my best friend Shanae and I
have to grab it off first for this video
she absolutely loves when she uses it
everything day I'm fairly sure Lauren
Turner's love this as well and I know
Shawnee absolutely love also concern
about the product so I'm going to use
and I told her this moment and she look
like any cheating I love that my reason
thing one of the shading is very very
also this is a shade of soft brown and I
just find it very very dark number two
is the texture of it is very very see
excuse my nails I need to get them done
but if you can see this the line that
goes across there I thought my brushing
it to see what the color and the texture
was like and my brush went straight
through I was like to another three it
is so crazy hard to work with and so
pigmented as well I feel like it's very
very hard to blend and fade in the front
of the brow because obviously if you
want a natural brow you want its way
through the front and you literally have
to like tap you can't even tap you're
brushing you have to like slowly hover
over it for it to like pick up the tiny
little bit of products
and to set my brows I'm going to using
the Loreal brow compiler in the shade
light/medium I really don't like how it
sits on top of the brow hair it doesn't
necessarily like even set the brown hair
but the product is kind of like sits on
top I need to do that a lot in my videos
actually and I think I just used it to
force myself Elisha's can you see how it
just like fits on top of the brow and
actually set the brow hairs or anything
it just kind of sits on top and the
color is so weird well I said I'm going
to using the knob look closer
a shadow palette I freaking love knobs
and as is one of my favorite brands ever
don't ever get is there a chemise and
not printed at all and especially for
how expensive they are it's just like it
looks like a little bit disappointing
but it's actually have really good
shades in it especially the shaky I was
so excited to do an eye shadows look
using the shade on my lid I'm rubbing my
finger in there quite a bit and I'm
going to swatch it well let me do
another layer it's honestly like there's
nothing even there I don't get it I
honestly think it is very disappointing
especially how happy they are and how
unpigmented some of the shades are
especially for $70 I don't the news
whether adequate if there's any warm
transition shades and it can go straight
in with the dark brown and apply that in
my crease as I drown in the black are
like doable I feel like you could work
with them and you could get a really
nice look reason but the other two
shades I just I just can't get into that
taupey brown shade like when I first
watched sure you should have seen my
face I was flat I was so disappointed I
also just find me shadows a little bit
hard to blend as well I delight I kinda
just sort of fit in the place where you
put them that I don't really want to
blend as you can see together mean I
just applied it in my crease and it
doesn't want to go anywhere else it just
wants to say this now I'm just going on
this crazy brow shape if you'll find
that all over the lid
I mean see I mean the broschi isn't that
bad I just find it very hard to blend
mating up to ask ah I feel like I'm
going to get so much hate for this
because everybody loves the subscriber
is one of the like my sinuses cars in
the world and was when he raised a lotta
everybody uses it everybody talks about
it I was honestly it's so disappointed
and now I have like five I don't know
why I have so many Jen I'm really trying
to like it I really really am so this is
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
thing I just don't like about it is the
ones I feel like it's very hard to use
especially if you have little eyes my
eyes aren't too little but if your eyes
are smaller than mine I feel like this
would be impossible especially to get
like in there I feel like I'm just going
to like jab it into my nose I find it
very very clumpy as well if you do like
company lashes and this was perfect for
you
I don't worry I want to like it I really
really want to love it I just feel like
it's so sore and hard for you and I find
it so comfy
now maybe onto the rail set which is
lips the lip products that I really
don't like is the Jeffrey saut velour
liquid lipstick the reason I don't like
these I found it very uncomfortable on
the lips I found them very drying the
applicator is really really nice I will
say that I really like the applicator
ever that sweeps of these eye donors
everything looks elliptic from Jeff Issa
is the dodgy one of mine basements or
disgusting they smell like chemicals and
when I breathe it in it honestly like
hurts my throat it just looks it
literally just makes a I thought I make
someone like gag it or it gets stuck in
the back my spirit and it stings but for
some reason it smells so high of
chemicals and it just really grosses me
out
so my Jeffrey's looking lipsticks that I
do iron I love the shade but this is in
the shade iron root and this is just the
lightest shade root I've ever used it is
lesser than my concealer like I'm not
even joking
honestly if you can rock this I
congratulate you because this just looks
so bad I mean I don't know the shade was
made to mix with other shades to make
them lighter but it is just an again I'm
so embarrassed right now
I look sorted I look gorgeous I look
absolutely stunning I don't think you
can say that I can fill up concealer I
don't need you say about the lipstick is
already going really close when I cut
off line literally two minutes serious
is a finished makeup look I cannot get
enough of this contour so this is an
access on my skin it's gotten really bad
into my fine lines and I am literally my
foundations ever get into my fine lines
look maybe that foundation just isn't
meant to be so I really really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and if you did
it please don't forget to give it a
massive thumbs up and subscribe if
you're new s1 say one more time if any
of these products work for you please
like get a friend
because they just don't work for me and
I just don't necessarily like them on my
face and for my skin I hope you all
having a really awesome day and I'll
treat you all very high it obviously
looks like I got hair growing like I'm a
kid but it looks like I've grabbed a
little like bits of hair stop this
