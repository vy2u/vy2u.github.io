my channel so today I have a super
exciting video for you guys because it
is another festival inspired at makeup
look and the reason why today's video is
so exciting is because it is a
collaboration with my gorgeous friend
here on YouTube Isabella Fiore I'm sure
plenty of you know who she is she is
seriously amazing so today we have two
festival makeup books for you guys now
they actually very similar because we
got inspiration from this person here so
I actually traded this perhaps who else
he does if you wanted to see um a
recreation of this makeup look and Bella
saw the photo and she want us to record
it through which she said she did wanna
copy me and I was like girl do your
thing you're not copying me so we
thought what better idea than to collab
and recreate it for it so today we have
both recreated this freaking amazing
festival inspired makeup look this
makeup look seriously one of the hottest
makeup looks I've ever done in my life
no that's amazing as this but I tried I
tried so if you guys would like to see
how I recreated this festival inspired
makeup look then please keep on watching
and be sure to go over to Bella's
channel and check out hers as well
starting with foundation I'm going in
with NARS sheer glow in the shade of
Barcelona and I'm just popping this into
my skin with a dab of Beauty Blender now
this foundation is seriously amazing it
has full coverage and it is so
long-lasting I wrote to a festival about
two weeks ago and my makeup stay put all
day it was amazing sorry I'm going to
finish the rest of the base later after
weaves on the eyes now I'm just going
ahead and quickly filling in my eyebrows
with the anastasia dipbrow pomade in the
shade soft brown so just do my thing
doing them in like I usually would and
then I'm just going to go ahead and set
them in place with a clear brow gel
and this is where the fun stuff starts
sorry I'm taking makeup geeks creme
brulee and I'm going to be whacking this
into the crease as my transition shade
this wasn't very necessary this step I
actually don't even know why I did it
myself
and then I'm just going in with makeup
geek Summerall Perry and I'm just going
to be tracing out my cut crease now this
doesn't have to be needed oh this was
just a guide to see where my cut crease
would start and yeah so you don't have
to be neat with this and then I'm just
going to be taking the shade Moreau
carry on another blending brush and I'm
gonna start blending that off into my
crease to get a really nice transition
and I always have this buffing brush on
the side with nothing on it just to buff
out any harsh lines and make everything
smoky and blended here I picked up the
shade at chickadee and I'm blending that
over the shading rocker this is just to
make it look a lot more orange because I
found that when I blend to the out it
didn't look as orange and I wanted the
orange to really be intense going in
with the shade of bitten I'm going to
start blending this oweme oweme on my
outer V and into the crease and this
actually makes the most gorgeous
transition shade between the orange and
the pink and I think one of the main
points to this makeup look is to make
sure you're constantly blending so yeah
I'm just blending those shades together
and making that sure that there are no
harsh lines I went over a few times with
this shade just to get the intensity and
the darkness that I wanted it so you can
pretty much apply this over as many
times as you won I won I didn't quite
javanese times 3 I today a few times I'm
now going in with a zoeva winks at Lana
brush and taking the shade of Morocco by
makeup geek again and this is where I
really defined the cut crease and really
caught the crease I'm so bad at
explaining this I'm terrible I'm sorry
I've never explained this before yeah
sorry I just went in and defined to the
cut crease and then blend at the top of
the Reese out so that was old smoky
and blended and I did this a few times
because I wanted it intense how many
times can i say intense in this one
video going in with chi Chi's white
three in one jumbo eye pencil I'm
applying this through a little detailer
brush and then applying this to my lid
this is just a base for the lid color so
that the liquid will pop a little bit
more and it'll be a little bit more
brighter I found it easier to apply it
to the brush press and then apply to my
lid then applying it directly onto the
lid because it is quite a thick pencil
sorry either I want to make any mistakes
I just realized how tight I sounding
these voice overs I need like make
myself a little bit happier going in
with makeup geeks a foiled eyeshadow in
the shade it's still the spotlight I'm
pretty sure in the spotlight oh my god
I'm saying my favorite youtubers name in
the spotlight and her my mind is all
over the lid and on the inner tear-duct
this is like a gorgeous pearly white
shade and such with it and I'm making
sure that I blend the outer V shade in
with the lid shade so that there is a
nice transition between the shades
because you don't want it to be like
blocks like a straight line if you have
anything
 Sula I'm taking it Maybelline
fit me in the shade of fat and just
apply this under my eyes and down the
center of my face and this is going to
just give us a really nice highlighted
effect and I'm just blending that all in
with a damp Beauty Blender and I'm also
taking the time to clean up the line
where my eyeshadow is with this
concealer so it's really crisp setting
the places I highlighted with my Allison
Jade contour kit and I'm just taking the
banana shade to do so and you guys know
the drill setting the rest of my face
with my Australis fresh and flawless
pressed powder in the shade at darkest
Brown I'm now going ahead and contouring
my face with my matte bronzing powder in
the shade matte bronze
so just starting out by contouring my
cheekbones and I really did intensely
contour my face because why not it's a
festival and then I'm going ahead and
contouring my temples in my forehead and
then taking that down my jawline and of
course contouring my nose because you
can never go wrong with contouring your
nose it's like my number one must to
everything you'll make a book I'm now
going in with Mac's beauty powder I'm
pretty sure this is very similar to a
blush or it is a blush and this is in
the shade at Pearl blossom this is just
like a really baby pink pink shade and
it's got like a lot of glitter through
it and shimmer and I'm applying this to
the cheeks and also to the places where
I usually highlight and also to my
temples this is going to act also as a
base for the paint highlight and just
give us that kind of like a round pink
luminous look if you get them saying
actually had in the photo I'm not too
sure what I'm trying to explain right
now I'm going in with the shade of
bitten and adding a tiny bit of
corrupted to it and I'm just going to be
applying this to my lower lash line and
I'm actually wearing this out a little
bit it does look crazy until I blend it
but I win this out on the lower lash
line and on the top lash line
and then I just take that because this
video really shows you guys how bad I am
at explaining things when I try new
things I just cannot explain them to
save my life sorry I'm pretty sure I
just applied three different pairs of
lashes or I applied the same lash but
the same eye I have no idea
I think that was saying we're just gonna
rock it anyway and not just lining my
lower lash line
with a bit of black liner I turn it to
this half way in because I don't like
how I look with eyeliner but I'm
recreating the part I'm recreating the
makeup look so I thought what I got off
and now just cutting my lower lashes
with a few coats of mascara to highlight
I'm actually using an eyeshadow it is
the natio loose powder eyeshadow this
doesn't have a name unfortunately but
it's just like a really beautiful like
pearly baby pink shade and I'm just
applying this to the high points of my
cheeks this is very similar to the color
that she wore in the photo and now I'm
going in with a makeup geek to Sparkle
out in the shade halo and this is kind
of like pure glitter so I thought this
was perfect to add over the top it's
very like pink and purple and got a lot
of sparkle to it so yeah
I forgot to mention I also applied these
true at my temples then I just
highlighted the tip and bridge of my
nose with my Mac soft and generous now
that we found stuff I'm creating the
line at down the middle of the forehead
with just a black eyeliner this is very
easy very simple enough for the dots I'm
using the chichi jumbo eye pencil and
I'm just creating six dots either side
I'm going over the top of my eyebrows
for the dots you can use the body paint
or anything you want I just thought this
is easier because this is what I had on
me and it seems to do the same job and
now I'm taking the shade white last by
makeup geek and this is just a pure
light eyeshadow and I actually spritz my
brush with a bit of fix+ and apply this
over the top just kind of just like I
said that I pencil and made the dots a
little bit more vibrant and more and
then I highlighted my Cupid's bow with
the makeup geek spark light in the shade
halo this just added the most gorgeous
Harden and for the very last step lips
I'm applying the matte lipstick in the
shade at naturally transformed
and then I really top of that I'm
applying the bomb read my lips lip gloss
and we shave it snap and then that is
the completed makeup look so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
