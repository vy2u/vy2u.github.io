my channel I just realized you guys
probably can't see my makeup so let's
remove the Hat okay you guys can
probably see my makeup a little bit
better
so today I decided to film a festival
inspired makeup look now I'm sure every
single one of you know that at the
moment right now Coachella is happening
and I am so jealous and envious of
everyone there but next year that would
be my time and I'm so excited
sorry I've already been to three
festivals this year and I have another
huge one coming up within the next three
weeks so I thought what better way to
bring on the festival season by giving
you guys a festival slash Coachella
inspired makeup look so today I've used
a lot of gold and glitter two of my
favorite things and personally I think
nothing screams at festivals more than
lots of glitter sequins sparkles and all
that sort of fun stuff so if you guys
would like to grab some inspiration or
see how I created this festival inspired
makeup look then please keep watching
and let's jump straight into it so I
just started off by spritzing my face
with the Mac Mac Mac prep and prime and
this is just going to allow for a
healthy glow I'm priming the skin with
my benefit Porefessional primer and I
actually mix this with my ultra sitacles
UV protective moisturizer and just
working out into the skin with my
fingers for foundation today I'm going
to be using my unique mineral touch
foundation in the shade taffeta and I'm
mixing that with my good to glow Rimmel
London illuminator now this foundation
is seriously amazing it is so
lightweight it just feels like a
moisturizer and it is light to medium
coverage but you can build it up I think
a lightweight foundation is perfect for
a music festival because you're going to
be in the Sun all day and you're going
to be sweating it off and it's not a
nice feeling having a really heavy
foundation on and I'm mixing that with
my Rimmel London good to glow
illuminator just to give us a really
nice healthy glow
and a Joey finish the skin sorry I just
like to apply that with a concealer
brush and then blend it in with a damp
Beauty Blender I find this gives the
best coverage and makes it look the most
flawless to conceal I'm taking my Mac
Pro Longwear concealer in the shade NC
25 this is a few shades lighter than my
skin tone and I'm just applying that
onto my eyes down my nose and on the
center of my face just to give us that
really nice highlighted effect and this
makes you look more awake and alive I
find so just applying that in the places
that I want to highlight and conceal and
blending that in with a damp Beauty
Blender this is one of my new favorite
concealers I find the coverage of it
amazing and this concealer lasts all day
I want it on its own before and it makes
my skin look flawless and yeah it just
gives the best coverage and lasts so
long
and to lightly set the places I can soon
I'm taking my Allyson J to contour
palette and I'm just going to be taking
the banana shade and just pressing that
into my skin where I applied the
concealer and to lightly set the rest of
my face I'm taking my Australis fresh
and flawless pressed powder in the shade
darkest Brown you guys know the drill my
favorite powder ever
now moving on to contouring and taking
my Mac bronzing powder in shade at matte
bronze and I'm just going to contour my
face with this now I think the harsh
contour is definitely needed for a
festival because why not go all out oh
sorry I'm just contouring my cheekbones
my forehead my jawline and my nose this
has been one of my favorite brands is at
the moment and I kind of recommend it
over the fuller benefit bronzer it just
gives a really natural look and it's
just so easy to work with and so easy to
blend and go am i doing that nose
contour strong because why not my
favorite thing about festival makeup
tutorials is the bronze sunkissed skin
so I'm taking my Mac give me Sun and I'm
just applying this to my cheeks and my
forehead it just really bronzed up the
skin and give us that sunkissed bronzed
look and this step is amazing I
absolutely love doing this and this
product is just the best if you don't
have it you seriously need to get your
hands on it as many of you probably know
I do have my eyebrows tattooed on
so I'm just going to lightly go through
them with a brow powder this is just
going to make them look a little bit
more intense and frame the face a little
bit more and then just setting them with
a brow gel so they stay in place all day
moving on to eyes I'm going to stick
around the bronze and gold tones so I'm
just taking my Mac give me Sun and
working that into the crease
oh I forgot to finish my sentence so I'm
just using this as a transition shade
and this is just going to give the eye a
little bit more depth now taking a
makeup geek shadow in the shade at
preppy this is just like a dirty brown
color it's got like a really cocky green
undertone to it and I'm keeping the eyes
very simple and easy for you guys so I'm
just applying this all over the lid and
I'm blending it into the crease and this
is really the only shadow I use on my
lid apart from a gold glitter but yeah
now going in with my unique moonstruck
palette I'm taking the shade of brassy
and this is very similar to a pressed
glitter so I'm just really intensely
applying this to the center of my lid
and as I said at the start of the video
I'm using a lot of gold and a little
glitter so this shade is perfect and
here I actually applied a bit of fix+ to
my brush and applied it over the top
just to make it a little bit more
intense and pop a bit more and then just
going ahead and blending through the
crease just so that there are no harsh
lines and everything is blended nicely
and taking the shade it preppy again I'm
just applying this along my lower lash
line and just smoking that out
now taking the shade up for that right
from the moonstruck palette I'm just
focusing this right on my lower lash
line this is just going to make it look
a little bit more smoky and darken up
the lower lash line a bit more and give
it a little bit more like oh you know
and then I'm just blending that all
together for falsies today I'm taking
the aloha 117
now these eyelashes make me so excited
they are my new favorites they're so
amazing and I definitely recommend them
over the Ardell whispies they're so
natural looking and so wispy and I've
never applied it lashes so easily like
these just go on themselves and I just
think they're perfect for a music
festival and well it's just can't
explain how much I love them
I'm taking the shade white liars by
makeup geek and I'm just applying this
under my brow bone to highlight and then
just going in with a bit of mascara and
creating my lower lashes get the chorus
now to add a pop of gold and taking a
makeup geek spoiled eyeshadow in shaded
magic act and I'm just applying this on
my inner corner and I definitely think
this just completes the eye look it
definitely pulls it all together and it
is just stunning like I think adding
gold in my inner corner is my new
favorite thing
now we're getting super close to the fun
stuff to give us that gorgeous golden
glory I'm taking my mary-lou manizer by
the balm and mixing it with my makeup
geek foiled eyeshadow in the shade
and just highlighting the high points of
my face so my cheekbones my nose and
which off my eyebrows and my forehead at
my chin
now for one of my most asked questions
how I create freckles so I'm going to
show you so I actually use a liquid
lipstick to create freckles because I
find this lasts the longest and it
doesn't smudge it doesn't budge and it
doesn't move so the liquid lipstick I
like to use is the line primer Velveteen
in the shade of Salem it because it is
just a perfect brown and it is seriously
so long-lasting and I just take a tiny
little brush that is used for Windsor
Lena and I simply just put random dots
all over my nose and cheek area if you
want but I kind of stay away from the
cheeks but yeah just randomly placing
dots everywhere I find this is the most
natural-looking and the best way to do
it and I find fake freckles are so in at
the moment I know Kendall Jenner does it
and I just think they're so cute and
then I like to set them with a
translucent powder i find this makes
them last longer and it fades them a
little bit so they look more natural and
realistic and then that is how you
create fake freckles they are so cute
and I love them now moving on to the fun
stuff I'm taking a gerenuk indie glitz
gold glitter and applying this to my
face I highly recommend if you're not
using a powdered glitter to use an
acid-free one non-toxic and water-based
because you don't want to be putting
those gross toxic chemicals onto your
face so I'm literally just applying this
to my finger and tapping it onto the
places that I want to apply glitter I
feel like when it comes to glitter you
just apply it wherever you feel free or
wherever looks good because you can't go
wrong with glitter I mean it's glitter
so I just applied this on the cheekbone
area and worked it up to my eyebrows on
one side and then my forehead and worked
it down to my cheekbones on the other
side but I almost wish I had a loose
glitter to apply over the top because I
kind of went overboard with this and it
dried funny so when I do this for a
music festival I'm going to be applying
a little bit of this and then sticking a
loose glitter over the top because I
find it looks a bit more natural that
way I mean wait natural glitter doesn't
look natural but it just looks a lot
better because this had a funny
consistency when it dried and then I
also went and applied this through my
eyebrows I mean just because why not
as I kind of wanted to play with the
makeup look a little bit more so I took
a magic act and I applied this to my
Cupid's bow I really intensely
highlighted my keepers bow gold then I'm
just going in with that gold glitter
again and find that over the top I don't
know how I thought of this I just
thought it would look cool and it turns
out cool so yeah and now moving on to
lips I'm taking Maps naturally
transformed and I'm applying this to my
lips this is such a gorgeous color but
the only downside is that it's very
similar to my skin tone so it kind of
blends in with my face so then I went in
with line crowns velvetine in the shade
Salem and just applied this over top and
this just made a really nice brown shade
and yeah also I wore this in my recent
video so if you're wondering what I had
on my lips this is the lip combo I was
wearing
and that would be very last step to the
makeup look I'm adding these little
jewels so I actually got these little
stars from a craft store and I weren't
even looking for like the confetti ones
like the really thin ones but I couldn't
find them so I thought these would do
and I just stuck three of these on
either side of my face where I apply the
glitter and I just took these on with
the glitter glue that I applied to my
face and then my camera died and now for
the very last step and one of my
favorite parts is to add jewels and
accessories so my necklace is from
Lazzara I'm pretty sure that's how you
pronounce it this is so festival like
this just for a music festival I wear it
all the time and I'm obsessed with it
then I went to apply my septum ring and
it broke I've never been so upset in my
life I was so upset when this happened
like just a time I need a new brakes
then I applied these gorgeous crystal
earrings which are from Lazzara as well
and last but not least you can't go to a
music festival at a hat so this is just
from a lack of colors and we're done
so this is a finished look I absolutely
love how golden and glittery it turns
out if you did enjoy this video and
would like to see more festival related
videos in the future then please give
this video a thumbs up also give this
video a thumbs up or leave me a comment
if you would like to see a festival
outfit ideas video I hope you're having
an amazing day stay pretty and I'll see
you very soon bye I wish I had like a
palmer glitter so I could just do it and
I blow it everywhere
I'm just trying to cover up my second
face
Oh
best song of all time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
