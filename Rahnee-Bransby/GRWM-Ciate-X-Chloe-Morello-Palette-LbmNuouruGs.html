get there's such gorgeous shades in here
you can do Sasori makeup looks there's
so many warm shades and cool shades I
want to do some sort of halo eye today

to stop by sparing my face with the
Mario Badescu at where's Laura
it's incredible in it seriously I love
it so much I'm obsessed and super on
this game and you see my all-time
favorite to base my regular primal
foundation today I'm using the Too Faced

Snake and syllabi Maybelline and
supplying this under my eyes and down
the bridge of my nose now I'm just
taking my Allison I ate at quintile
pallet a new shade light and it's taking
the banana shade to set onto my eyes
what was this
and of course setting the rest of my
face with my astrologer on strikes with
Australis fresh and flawless pressed
powder in the shade Jacques Brown maybe

the matte bronzing powder and you shake
bronze just to contour my cheekbones my
forehead my temples and my inner circle
and I'm using a Sigma small contour
brush to do so
now time to use this a beautiful palette
I'm going to start out by using this
shaking a coat unconditional and that's
going to be my transition shade crop I
grabbed the wrong shade I grabbed the
shade on fire because it's like a shade
darker honor okay now I'm just taking
the shade on fire and I'm gonna put that
through the crease as well now I'm going
to take the shade of flood and this is
just like a morena pebble shade and I'm
going to put this on the outer V and the
inner corners
guys these eyeshadows seriously blend
like a dream the star nice to blend
now I'm just going in with this gorgeous
golden champagne shade and I'm going to
pack that on the center of my lid where
there is no shadow yet I could have
learnt to breathe when I'm sick because
I always forget
what is that oh that's part of an
eyelash now I'm going in with a shade of
flour once again and I'm going to strike
that along my lower lash line
what are we please hand gestures
sorry I just went ahead and applied
lashes and mascara and now for my cheeks
I'm going to be using the magic go to
Plaza and I'm going to apply this all
over my chains and I think I want to mix
that with a bit of the two if I
sweetheart blush in the shade Paige
Paige I want like something bronzy about
something pink so I think I'm gonna make
these three together
maybe OSU hi Lila I'm going to be using
at the Allison J to highlight and shade
fancy this is like a pelican shape so I
think it's been a good package with the
eyes and I'm just going to apply this
all over my face
no all over my face I have weights on my
face
going ahead and finishing off the eyes
that don't want to come out always I'm
going to take the shane at my tribe and
i'm going to highlight my brow bearing
with this
and now I'm taking the shade at dainty
and I'm going to apply this on my inner
corners
and to finish up the look I'm taking the
colour-pop ultra cross and to finish up
the lip and to finish up the look I'm
taking the colour-pop ultra glossy lip
in the shade way or and applying this
all over my lips
and to set the pace I'm taking some of
my ovens okay all night making knit my
ovens can't will night a setting spray
