last thing I want to talk to you guys
about before jumping on in terms of

pen that i've been using now i decided
to speak this up because i have seen all
those teeth whitening um when they
called tooth whitening products before
where you have to put the like laser
blue laser light in your mouth or
something and they look so uncomfortable
and i have used one before and it
literally just filled my mouth up with
saliva and stuff and i really didn't
like it so I picked up this little pen
here and it is a advanced teeth
whitening pen and it is from the hallow
smile I would darlings falorians topic
so what it is is just a pen and
has the whitening gel formula inside and
all you do is twist the pen and pop it
onto t leave it on for half an hour and
then wash your mouth out and I use this
one I'm doing my makeup in the morning
as well as just before i go to bed at
night and it seriously it's amazing i've
seen so much change in the color of my
teeth they look so much more wider and
