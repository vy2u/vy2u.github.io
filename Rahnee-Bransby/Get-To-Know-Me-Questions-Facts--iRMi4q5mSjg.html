about to film I spray perfume and what's
your sure why because it's not like you
guys can smell me anyway hi everyone and
welcome back to my channel in today's
video I am filming a get summary video
because I felt like filming something a
little bit different to my other videos
here on YouTube and I feel like a get to
memory video is more personal and I just
want you guys to get to know me because
I feel like my studies don't really know
me and I can't express Who I am through
a makeup tutorial so I'm just going to
be answering a few cuts ones that I
found online and also telling you guys a
few facts about me so let's get on with
the video and I hope you guys all enjoy
all sorry I am so sorry I haven't posted
a video in like three weeks I have a
good reason actually I did film a few
videos but I wasn't able to put them
onto my laptop because I used to have
one of the old Wyatts MacBooks and the
new update for iPhoto wasn't suited to
the update so I wasn't able to get my
footage onto my computer so every time
we had to save up in my MacBook Pro
which I did so now I can edit and film
all the time my birthday is on January
30th and when I was a kid I always hated
it being so early in the year because my
birthday always fell four or five days
before school went back and I always
wanted my birthday to be on a school day
because I was always jealous of the kids
I went to school and have their
birthdays because I felt like they got
treated like so special in itself but I
don't even know why I hated it so much I
just always one of my birthday's to be
on a school day no I like I don't I was
we did I was a really weird kid
I am actually I really obsessed with my
cat so I put all of these who don't have
me on snapchat literally you are so
lucky because oh my snapchat stories
done literally just on my cat
I just can't live without my cat he's
like my little world before I go to bed
at night I have to make my bed like
literally I can't get into a bed that
isn't made otherwise I won't be able to
sleep and all my friends will know this
because I've actually made their bed
before we go to sleep but I don't know
it's sleepy and I just have to make my
bed or my bed has to be made before I
jump in I have three older brothers and
they named arcade Lea and Ryan but not
many people that I have to row two
brothers day always anything I am an
early child or I haven't won over a lot
like him but I'm closest with it Kate I
am sorry insecure about my teeth this is
kind of a reason why normally talk in my
videos either I just think they disgust
me
and I am gonna cry so soon and I'm just
like freaking excited like when I get
braces I'm gonna throw a party and you
guys can all come because I'm so excited
to get them but I kind of got into the
fact now where I don't really care I'm
just trying to be me bracelet because
everyone has imperfections about them
and I'm just like whatever lack goes on
okay so I actually wrote these questions
on my phone age is very high rate them
in August and one of them was I'm really
good at saving money I am not good at
saving money I recently got a job about
three or four months ago but literally I
saw can save you money like if I was
saving up for something I just recently
bought a MacBook Pro and I stayed up for
that and I'm good at that but
I can't save any more like as students I
get paid it's going within that day
Kenzo Jenna and Kylie Jenner on my
ultimate Queens I literally would die if
I saw them out in public I would
literally have a bin full of the first
thing I noticed on a person is their
eyebrows and their teeth if you have
amazing eyebrows I would literally Ameri
like I'll get on my knees I'm married I
just like puffy eyebrows I like the key
to life and I love like perfect teeth
like I f so jealous like if you have
perfect teeth I will want to rip them
out put them in my mouth because I
cannot stand it when people point at me
like if I'm having an argument with you
or something especially with my mom when
she tells me I'm she points at me and oh
my god I just can't stand it like it
makes me so angry I just feel like it's
like it's so demanding like it's just
the power of the finger has I'm really
obsessed with my phone and when I mean I
am obsessed with that I don't mean I'm
always on it and I'm always taking
selfies or whatever I mean I'm actually
obsessed with it for example India nine
I got suspended like a toaster size of
a4 being on my phone from school I
really really really really really
really really really
really really badly once you travel to
Greece I literally if I could grandma in
the world it would be Greece I think
it's a so stunning Eggman oh goodness I
have the biggest fear in the world of
birds for example if I can be a birds
and de tributo see them in the direction
I'm working I will take them on this way
possible to not go that way like to go
around them because I'm sorry terrified
of birds I just need those like scary
especially really rats house I was
freaking hey it really worked out I
can't stand when people like touch my
neck or going near my neck it just makes
me like whatever like someone touches my
neck like ah I just I just hate it so it
makes me feel uncomfortable I have a job
and I work in a cafe which is a really
popular cafe so most of you will
probably know it it is called the Coffee
Club so I am a waitress and I love my
job although it does gets so tiring
sometimes and there are also wash dishes
for living whoa so that is all of the
facts and now I'm going to answer a few
questions that I have found on the
internet or people who have asked me
three is your favorite Kardashian slash
in general and this takes us back to of
my facts that I just mentioned no longer
can i favorite Jenna's or break the
Germans I'm just obsessing than like I I
can't choose I can't choose between them
- and my favorite Kardashian is from
late I don't know I love them oh I'm
obsessed with Kim I think she's a
freaking god but I'm also obsessed with
Chloe because she
there are any cut Ashlee in that can't
really relate to it corny like I think
she's amazing Stu oh but you know I just
don't really have that kind of
conviction I'm talking like I'm like
best friends with them but yeah you guys
get what I'm saying would you never wear
makeup or not go shopping for a year
this is actually the hardest question on
em I read in my life I probably I don't
know I I use a long time and makeup is a
big thing
I probably not great shopping for yell
just because I'm obsessed with makeup
like it is my passion and I just can't
never not do it or wear it
the next question is who is your
favorite youtuber my favorite beauty
guru is Sean XR also known as Shannon
Harris
I think her videos are just so beyond
amazing she is perfect at what she does
and she's just so amazing I'm obsessed
with her and I also freaking love it Zoe
I think she's a cute little thing she's
just so adorable huh when you have a
thirty minutes of free time what do you
do to pass time now I usually just watch
youtube videos like actually just in my
lifetime probably in a day what you need
to view so that's why I'd probably do
and the next question kind of relates
the one I just answered and it is which
youtuber inspires me a shark so because
she's just so freaking
she does and I just would die to be hurt
and today and the other you know that
inspires me is one of my really really
good friends and she was just story
inspired because she was like how much
how rapidly she grew going to meet you
in such little time it's Shawnie German
and ego girlfriend you're amazing she's
amazing and so I committed at what she
does and I just think it's so inspiring
for the girls in considering how like
much effort she puts into our videos the
next question is do you ever count your
steps when you look and I kind of do
that kind of door so when that's like a
footpath you know how they have like the
blocks of cements and they have like one
two three what about on the full pots
yeah I always count how many steps I do
in that block does that make sense I'm
not sure if this is making sense I have
to do it at least four steps in each bit
of cement and I don't know if it's
really we I don't cross bite put my
stool on the line I don't know if this
is making sense I'm just gonna shock
I'm really bad at these things so that
is over the questions and facts about me
I hope you guys all enjoyed this video
even though it is something a little bit
different and also I'm so thankful for
you guys
I have reached 4,000 subscribers not
long ago and it just makes me so happy
like thank you so much so yes I am also
get on holidays in two weeks so expect
heaps and heaps of videos because I'm
just going to be filming all holidays
and I will see you guys all in my next
video bye
yes chance and I always move my arms
whenever I took my skin so notice before
me lots of feel man I feel like I can't
feel morally during those questions I
put that on silent
I make up to that bit alright
I'm like waving but my hands down he'll
say that guys like can't see me might
even see I'm just like hey guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
