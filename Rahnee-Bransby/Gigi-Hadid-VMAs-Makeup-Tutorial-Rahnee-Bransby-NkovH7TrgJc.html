channel thank you so much for watching
so Yasmin you here are aware last week
were the MTV VMAs and while I was
watching the vmas when gigi hadid came
on screen I was like oh my god she
seriously looked like an absolute angel
in my opinion I think GG was the best
dress she looked absolutely phenomenal
sorry I had to have to have to do and
try to make a look on her makeup because
her makeup was just absolutely amazing
her makeup was so simple but it was so
bronzed and like glowy and it was round
up my alley so I absolutely fell in love
me so today I decided to do my take on
Gigi's make up for the VMAs so if you'd
like to see how to get something
extremely similar to Judy's makeup then
please keep watching and let's jump
straight into it so starting out with a
primer i'm going in with NYX HD
photogenic primer now this primer is
awesome because it gives a smooth
complexion and a duly finish to the look
which is definitely what we're going for
for this Gigi Hadid look so I'm going in
with l'oreal paris looming the jet
foundation as i'm also going to be
mixing it with you revlon photoready
skin lights faced illuminating a bit
illuminator in the shade of bronze light
and as this foundation is a loony finish
it's going to give us that really chewy
finished anis illuminator is just going
to give us that really bronze goddess
look to the skin so I'm just working out
into the skin with a buffing brush and
then I'm going to go over with a Beauty
Blender just to blend it all into a skin
and give us that flawless finish so Gigi
has these tiniest bit of highlight on
for her eyes on her forehead and a
little bit on her chin so I'm going in
with Maybelline instant age rewind are
separately raised right in the shade
light and just applying this as my eyes
down my nose on my forehead and on my
chin just to highlight those places and
to blend that and I'm going to be using
the tip of a beauty blender so now as we
start the places I just highlighted i'm
going in with the Australis AC on to a
contour kit so I'm just going to be
taking what's left of my banana shake
just just at the places I
if you don't have access to this you can
use the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit as an alternative now I'm only going
to be setting the under eyes in the
places i highlighted I know he's setting
the rest of my face because I want that
to eNOS to still come through to the
skin so I just went ahead and filled in
my eyebrows now GG and I have completely
different eyebrow shapes so I tried to
fill me mine in a little bit more lesser
than usual and try to make it a little
bit more like fluffy and Harry because
Gigi's our girls are quite fluffy and oh
my god she's so lucky to have fluffy
eyebrows because I wish my eyebrows were
like really hairy and fluffy now GG has
quite a soft contour in the hollers over
cheats and a little bit on her temples
as well going in with the bahama mama
bronzer by the bomb and I'm just going
to lightly contour the hollows of my
cheeks a little bit on my temples and of
course contour my nose because my nose
is huge compared to duties so GD has
like such a perfect looking nose so I'm
just going to contour that down a bit to
make it look a lot a lot lot of them a
lot more slimmer so one of the main
focus points for Gigi's make up this
night was in my opinion the beautiful
bronze like glowy skin so I'm going to
go in with the Rimmel London natural
bronzer and just going to apply this on
to my cheeks just about the contour and
a little bit on my temples just to
really give the skin a sun kissed glow
and really bronze up with it all
together now moving on to your eyes I'm
going to be taking this Maybelline in
the news palette I'm gonna start out by
taking it this champagne gold shade and
i'm just applying that all over the lid
on the inner tear duct and a bit under
the brow bone
now i'm going in with the shimmery brown
shade and just applying that into the
crease now jjs look was so natural and
simple so we're only going to be
applying a tiny bit of this so I just
went ahead in a piping Cara 48 falsies
and I have to do this off camera because
I cannot apply eyelashes to save my life
so I had to be like really concentrated
when applying this now just going ahead
with the L'Oreal Paris fall / wings
mascara and just applying few coats of
juice through my top lashes and I just
tell you how did that shake up we used
in the crease I'm just going to run it
along my lower lash line I'm Gigi also
worn a mask on her bottom lashes which
I've never done before so you're
sticking with the look I'm not going to
be applying any mascara on my bottom
lashes and now because juji's look was
so highlighted and glowy I'm going to be
doing a lot of crazy highlighting so I'm
going to be taking my mary-lou manizer
by the bomb and I'm just going to be
sweeping this above my cheekbones on the
tip of my nose and bridge of my nose
I've got my eyebrows a bit on my
forehead my cuba's boy and my chin so
we're just going to be glove and like
crazy after this and now for the very
last job to put this whole together
we're going to finish up with our lives
so I person taking the Rimmel London
provoca lip to lip lacquer in the shade
of skinny-dipping and just applying this
over our lives but to add a bit more
glossiness and a bit more of a new color
we're going to be going in with the
Rimmel London apocalypse lip lacquer in
the shade admit eclipse but Luna quits
and just apply this over the top and now
that is the completed makeup look so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
look and if you did please don't forget
to give it a massive thumbs up because
it means a while to me also I would love
to do more celebrity inside makeup looks
in the future so leave in the comments
below who you think I should do next
because I would definitely do one of
those very soon so yeah don't you have
anything else to say other than I love
you guys and I'll see you all you
starting people very soon ah
