Oh
hey guys it's Ronnie and welcome back to
my channel so today I wanted to do a
little bit of a different makeup
tutorial I actually saw this better when
I was snooping around on tumblr this one
he L yep yep and I saw this rotary and
it wasn't even like should I feel that
it was like I have to film that this is
one of my favorite makeup looks I've
ever seen so I had to recreate it all
their guide to change up a little bit
with the stars because I don't have any
of these tiny little stars on me so as
here with big Styles which I originally
had time hannes but what can you do so I
think I'm going to go this makeup
tutorial I consider a fairy makeup
tutorial it is perfect for a festival
makeup tutorial vibe from so many
festival makeup looks and from the
lilacs and the purples and goats it
kinda reminds me of like a little fairy
so I think that's what I'm going to call
it I'm head over heels in love with this
makeup tutorial especially the lilac and
the gold together I can make a movement
each other so well the next festival I
will be roughing at this makeup look and
in fact when that is on right now and
I'm so upset I'm seeing all the
snapchats and all the photos and I'm
sitting here like I just wish I was that
so bad and I did have the opportunity to
scurry but next year there's always next
year so if you guys would like to see
how I recreated this makeup look and
then just please keep on watching and
let's rock this work sorry starting out
this is me trying to figure out if I
look bald or not so you're starting with
a foundation I'm going to using the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation today in
the shade at natural beige this is one
of my all-time favorite foundations the
coverage of it is amazing the color and
just like the look of it I love it so
much
sorry I'm just blending that with my
skin that with a damp Beauty Blender
by the way I had a huge a night last
night so I probably sounded so tired
right now so if I do don't worry I'm not
upset I'm just tired now moving on to
concealer I'm using the covergirl Ready
Set gorgeous concealer and I'm just
tapping this onto my eyes down the
bridge of my nose on my chin and on my
forehead to highlight
and of course going ahead and now I'm
just going ahead and setting the
concealer with my Allison Jada contour
palette with the banana shade in the
palette so just tapping this onto my
eyes and it's on the bridge of my nose
and I'm doing this on a real techniques
contour brush this brush is amazing for
setting under the eyes and stuff it is
so good and now of course just taking my
trusty old Australia specialist and
setting the rest of my face now I'm
going in with my Allison Jade contour
palette and I'm taking the middle shade
which is a core turned brown and I'm
just going to be lightly contouring now
I say lightly because I don't want to
look to be really bronzy or like really
intense contour I want it to be really
simple and elegant because I want the
face to be more girly and pink with a
blush and stuff like that if that makes
sense
I'm pretty sure I just rambled about
nonsense just then but yeah I'm just
going to lightly be contouring my
cheekbones my jawline my temples and my
nose and I'm doing this with a vanity
planet contour brush now this brush is
amazing I have a video coming up very
soon with a family planet brushes and
I'm so excited to show you guys because
they are just phenomenal and now I'm
taking my color pop brow pencil in the
shade of taupe taupe that is my favorite
shade name ever I'm like obsessed with
how cool it is anyway and I'm just going
to be lightly filling in my brows I
wanted to be quite soft and fluffy so
I'm not going to do this too harsh to
car
you
and now here's me and wiring how
gorgeous these shades are I never use
shadows like this so I was so excited to
do this look so first I'm taking the
makeup geek eyeshadow in the shade so
and this is just like a this is it this
is just like a lights baby pink and I'm
just blending that into the crease as my
transition shades and then I'm taking
the makeup geek foiled eyeshadow in the
shade it daydreamer and just packing
this over my lid I cannot get enough of
this shadow it is so gorgeous but in the
photo she actually did have a matte lid
but I didn't have any matte purple
eyeshadows like that time like that
lilac kind of color so I just used the
shimmer and now I'm going in with a
makeup geek eyeshadow initiate a
pencil-pusher i felt so weird saying
peso just name because I feel like in
Australia we say petal it's a petal
anyway I'm taking shade at petal pusher
and to just finding this through the
crease just to darken off the crease and
to look a little bit more and make sure
that everything is blended out through
the crease and then I'm taking at the
ortho liquid lipstick initiated v AB and
I'm using this of my liquid eyeliner
today this works amazing as a liquid
eyeliner it was so pigmented but I can't
promise you that it is eye-safe I'm not
too sure but I had to jump off camera
and do this because I can't stress to
you enough how much I suck at liquid
eyeliner hopefully the camera can pick
up the gold liner but please remind me
to never do a liquid eyeliner in my life
ever again because I suck bulls I'm so
bad at the good eyeliner that's why I
never do it anyway I know for that
complaining everyone's gonna start
somewhere so I just went ahead and
applied some lashes these are the odds
and whispies my absolute favorite and
then I'm going in with a makeup case
petal pusher again and I'm just blending
this out along the lower lash line yeah
and then of course just cursing my low
lashes with a few coats of mascara this
one I believe is the lash sensational by
Maybelline if I'm right but I totally
forgot to film it so yeah that's just if
you want to know what mascara I'm using
for blush I'm taking this beautiful
blush by makeup geek in the shade
Showtime and just applying this to my
cheeks this is just like a really rosy
pink shade with a bit of a purple
undertone and I don't usually wear these
shades but I'm actually starting to like
them
and now I'm taking this over
illuminating blush stripes little
compact thing so this is sorry pigmented
I didn't even realize it feels like pure
glitter like pressed glitter it is crazy
so I'm just using the pink and white
Shea to highlight my face and I can't
believe how intensely pigments as this
is it seriously like it's crazy oh my
god and especially the fact I was having
to use the tiniest little bit to apply
it to my face because if I like dipped
it in there too much it would have just
gone everywhere but anyway I'm also just
taking the white shade from the little
compact and I'm applying that to my
inner corners my brother and aunt also a
little bit just above my cheekbones my I
kind of just this is kind of like a base
for the glitter so that the glitter is
going to pop that little bit more and
then I'm just going in with a white
glitter over the top of the inner corner
brow bone and cheaper and highlight
and always remember you never have it
too much glitter so great absolutely
crazy with the glitter because that's
what makes it even more beautiful
consumer I'm just packing it on and I
just keep going like go on and go on and
go on and put my lips I'm taking the
colour-pop ultra matte liquid lipstick
and shade it trap this is just like a
nudie purple almost it's kind of like a
purpley undertone so I'm just applying
this to my lips and just to spice it up
a little bit and make it a little bit
more fairy like I took the daydreamer
foiled eyeshadow and I just Pat that
over the top just to add a bit of shine
onto my lips yay and now for my favorite
part
this is the last step of you makeup look
I'm just taking it some of these craft
stars you can just cross stars you can
just get them at your local craft store
and I'm just sticking these under my
eyes I'm so sad that I couldn't find any
smaller because I was going to go crazy
and put them everywhere but these were
so big so I just applied them onto my
eyes so yeah and then it was the stars
are on that is they completed makeup
look
so this is the finished makeup look I'm
head over heels in love with this makeup
look it is one of my favorites I've ever
filmed I think I love the gold and the
lilac you guys enjoyed this tutorial
