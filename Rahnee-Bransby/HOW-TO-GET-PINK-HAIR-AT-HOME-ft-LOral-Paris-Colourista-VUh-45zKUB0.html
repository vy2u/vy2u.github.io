to my channel so as you guys know I have
a pink hair it doesn't really look pink
right now because it is almost
completely washed out I have like the
tiniest little bit left but it has
almost fully come out so that means that
say I'm going to show you how to color
your hair from home the products are
going to be using to show you guys how I
thought my hair is the L'Oreal color is
still wash off now actually I'm working
with L'Oreal at the moment and this
video is sponsored by L'Oreal I've been
working with them on this products the
past two months I think and honestly it
is incredible it has honestly saved my
life because it is perfect just to do a
little touch-up as I said I have gone
through about two of these bottles
already so gloriously so many more times
I do you guys memory I've had silver
hair I high teacher I've had pink hair I
think that's all I got so I had it's
over hair half way through last year and
then in November I decided to go peach
and then since then I've been going back
and forth from peach and pink and now
that I've in peach or pink I feel like I
can't get out of the color hair like the
second addiction I love having colored
hair I think it looks so awesome and it
honestly just makes me so happy like
having pink hair just makes me feel so
good about myself because I do travel a
lot especially lately I'm going to be
travelling at so much and I'm not always
time to get my hair redone so I'm going
to show you guys how you can do it from
home and also it is a little bit pricey
to constantly be getting your hair done
especially with colored hair because
colored hair is not permanent it is
always going to what was I doing of it
woo it is always going to fade so I'm
just going to show you a cheaper and
easier alternative to it yourself next
week I'm going to go coast Brisbane
Sydney and Melbourne so I'm going to do
this in time it just for that so I
thought whatever some of you guys and I
can't decide if I want to do teach okay
so I think I were going to do like a
peach pink ombre
just to spice it up a little bit and see
what we can do and for my fellow
Australians that are attending splendor
which is next month I thought I'd phone
video for you guys because color hair at
festival
is my favorite thing so I got an old
shirt on I'm going to take all my
jewelry art and let's head into the
bathroom and I'm going to show you guys
how to do a really awesome ombre peach
and pink cabbages so the first step to
coloring your hair is having a little
boogie of course you gotta get in the
mood so these are the colors to wash out
I'm using the shade peach and pastel
pink so you get a 80 ml bottle and of
course gloves in the little package you
have to book love's on it is so
important you don't want pink or peach
and I mean I wouldn't be complaining but
you probably don't want that so I'm
going to start out by brushing out any
tangles or knots in my hair and then I'm
just going to be parting it so I like to
part it in three sections so I start by
parting the bottom half and leaving that
out to diet then I put that up and then
I part this into two sections and I
thought it again into two sections just
because smaller sections are easier to
work with and that way you know you're
getting every little piece of hair
because you definitely don't want it to
be patchy then I'm just going to shake
up the bottles so I don't know I did
this I just want it's like groove and
shake them up sorry I'm putting the
peach through the mid-length where I'm
pointing out now so you can put this in
a bowl and you can use a brush and mix
it up and just pretty much paint it onto
your hair but honestly I suck at hair so
the easiest way I find to do it is just
use your fingers it turns out just as
good I mean mine turns out amazing now
I'm just taking the pastel pink and I'm
just running this through the bottom of
my hair this is where my hair is the
most blonde so you can definitely see it
working it is so amazing it makes me so
excited but you want to make sure that
you are also spreading every little bit
of hair and you're covering every little
strand of hair because there may be some
hair that's hiding and you don't want
little patches of blondes or whatever
hair color you have so just make sure
you're saturating every single little
strand of hair and you'll be good to go
so now I'm just going ahead and do a
mouth full head of hair so peach through
the mid length and pink through the tips
and I really just focused on making sure
I have this on every little strand of
hair and just blending it in with my
fingers
so now that I've done my hair I'm just
going to wait you usually wait about 15
to 20 minutes 20 minutes for more color
intensity obviously minutes if you don't
want to as intense but I'm going to wait
20 minutes and then I'm going to wash it
out style it and I'll show you guys the
finished product it is time to wash this
our apologies about that let's go
so just had a shower and washed it all
out and I also told my hair so you guys
could see a better look of it and this
is how it turned out I'm honestly so
obsessed with how it turns out it
honestly looks amazing and it looks like
I haven't done it myself
so as you can see the ends are a little
bit darker because that's where I
applied the pink and the page just fades
through the mid-length the colors are
very similar but there is a little bit
of a transition as you guys can see so I
will leave a link below to where you can
purchases if you are interested also I
forgot to inform you guys they have so
many different colors they have blue
they have green they have purple if so
many colors oh I'm so excited to try out
a few different colors in the future if
