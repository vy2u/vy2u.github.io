my channel so a little disclaimer before
I jump into the video area I'm quite
sick at the moment so please excuse my
voice it's not a noisy I'm so sorry
because it annoys me too so today I have
a little bit of a different video I have
an eyebrow sculpting routine so today
I'm going to show you how I groom and
maintain my eyebrows and also how I fill
them in I do call them in a little bit
different now I do them more naturally
because I'm kind of over the whole bold
brow thing I never really liked it sorry
natural brow it is for me today I'm
featuring this awesome product that I
just started using so this is the rate
sensitive precision Beauty it's Tyler oh
it's got such a long name so what this
is is pretty much just a tool that
removes hair now I am seriously so
obsessed with this I've literally never
wanted to recommend a product more than
this item here in this tutorial I care
about how it works how you use it and I
also show you guys that demo of me doing
it myself
also how quickly saying it this video is
sponsored by it beat but I would never
recommend link to you guys I don't
believe in anthias I'm obsessed with I
was even told me to run manager today
and I'm like do you have this because
that you need together because it is
incredible it is such a lifesaver so you
guys would like to see how this crazy
little tool works and how I do my
eyebrows then it please keep on watching
and let's drop it straight into it sorry
I am completely crushed by at the moment
I'm going to start off with showing you
how I grew my brows now you want to make
sure you have no makeup on at well
grooming your brows because obviously
that would be pointless and it will take
the makeup off so you're starting off
with how I maintain and groom my brows I
know my brows done at least once a month
by my amazing eyebrow stylist Allyson
Jade actually you guys have heard me
talk about her a million billion times
but I do get my eyebrows Chinchin and
rocks at least once a month and I also
have my eyebrows at feather tattooed on
Ali and I travel quite a lot so there
are times where I'm not worried about
she's not home and my eyebrow has gross
incredibly fast isolate the first week
that already pushy so it maintaining my
eyebrows while I'm away on Ally its way
is a little bit difficult for me but I
have just recently discovered a product
that has saved me so much time and has
made my life so much easier through the
wonderful product I'm talking about is
the vite sensitive at precision beauty
at style so this is a hammer reboot
school so it gently and precisely
removes hair and associative areas like
your face you're on dance and your
bikini line and love the fact that this
can be used on your body as well as your
face because I have really sensitive
underarms the day I shaved them I can't
shave them for about five days after
because I have really sensitive skin
under my underarms and I get really bad
rashes
so this has literally been amazing for
my underarms I've actually used it on my
arms more than my eyebrows so this comes
in handy for everything so we're to show
you guys a little bit about this how it
works and then I'm going to show you
guys how I use it on my eyebrows so yeah
this is just a really gentle and precise
and easier way to go about removing hair
a lot of my friends actually fear
getting their eyebrows threaded or wax
or even plucking them because they fear
the pain even I'm like that when I get
my eyebrows waxed I'm like deep breath
you can do this because I'm a sucker
when it comes to pain I feel pain like
crazy baby do fear getting your eyebrows
done because of the pain this literally
will be perfect for you sorry get these
little cutting blades at the top are
actually so gentle you can touch them
with your fingers and they don't
actually cut and the awesome thing is
that these cutting blades actually don't
touch those skin so you don't have to
worry about getting any nasty cuts on
your eyebrows and rubs or on your bikini
line when I first used this I was
terrified I was like oh my god am I
going to cut my face off but then I
realized they don't actually touch the
skin I'm gonna share with you guys
everything that comes with the styling
scent when you purchase so you actually
get so much it's crazy so first of all
you get the optional styler itself and
then just a cap that goes on top of the
razors obviously because you don't want
them to get damaged in it you get this
little head not little this is a bigger
head then you get this head here as far
as the blades go on this be
heads are the exact thing this is
obviously just beer to cover a bigger
area so this is the one I use under my
arm and then you also get these little
two cream attachments which go on each
of the head
obviously the cards are self-explanatory
they just brush the hairs in one
direction and then you get this tiny
brush so you can get rid of what he has
in the blade this comes up so handy
because something has actually got
really stuck in this and most
importantly you get a little pouch put
everything in when you're traveling so
nothing goes missing or you don't lose
anything and this is going to be perfect
when I travel because as I said I do
travel a lot and there's a lot of times
where I need my eyebrows freshly done
but I always say can't fly back to path
to get them done sorry everything just
fits in this bag perfectly sir nothing
Goods missing or gets damaged I think I
covered everything and so now for the
pot that I'm sure you all dyin to see is
how the hell does this work I'm going to
zoom you guys in and show you how I use
it on my brows and that's good so I'm
going to start off with Luis McCoy as
I'm just going to make sure that I brush
my hairs in a place so that I'm not
going to accidentally take off any hairs
that I don't want to be shaken off so as
you can see I have a lot of hairs under
here and above here and I actually have
a few fuzzy ones clear because I haven't
had my eyebrows waxed in about three
weeks because Ali has actually been in
Melbourne this is going to be so loud so
I hope you can still hear me so or user
is it's very simple I like to pull the
skin tight so there is a more precise
cut and simply you just start running it
along the skin and taking off those
little hairs
so this is how they look after as you
can see it's taken off all the hair into
there and at the top and it's just
really tidy them up you take the head
off and you just run out of water and
what Shirley has out of it so that is
how I grew my brows and I've been
absolutely loving this item at the
moment and as you can see for yourself
it is so amazing it just such a good job
at just tidying up and cleaning up brows
so if you are interested in getting this
I'll leave a link below and definitely I
highly recommend trying this out I
actually called stop looking at my brows
I've never liked my brows throughout
that much and then use this before with
them that bushy and they look a freaking
amazing
they look like freshly done
we help sweet how I feel it in my brows
I used to sweat by Bravo mates my
favorite was the UH Nastasia broth were
made and I love powders as well I drink
these patterns that much anymore because
my eyebrows are feather touch me the
rest of the time I just like them
natural because they don't really need
to be crazy filled in but when I do feel
the meaning that our two products that I
always turn to you I don't like using
brow pomade any more because I feel like
they're so intense as so hard and I
don't really think bulb brows are like
the trend at the moment natural brows
are definitely the way scary everyone is
working natural brows which I absolutely
love because that memorize just look so
freaking amazing sorry I absolutely love
using brow pencils to fill in my brows
my two favorites are the color pop
director brackets and to be Mac eye brow
crayon pencil in the shade of lingering
but be color pop one I swear by this is
my favorite brow pencil in the whole
world
sorry I start by just brushing the brows
out with the end of the spoolie now when
I filled them in as I said a million
times my eyebrows are or a feather touch
bruiser I don't really have to do
anything with them I just shape them a
little bit more sorry I just lightly
sketch the brow pencil across the bottom
of the brow and then I lightly sketch it
through the art and down the tail it's a
lot slippy front of the brow I just
lightly feather the pencil through
and then that is how he brought looks
filled in as you can see it from the
before and after it is very similar one
just is a little bit mobile Ratan has a
lot more shade to it
this is how my brows look it filled in
and then I like to take the benefit 3d
brow sprays in the shade tree and I like
to run this through my brows through set
them in place
so that is how I groom and filling my
brows now I'm going to quickly jump off
camera through the rest of my makeup and
come back so you guys can see how my
brows look with a full face of makeup so
that they're not so dark and then this
is how my brows look with a full face of
makeup sorry I really hope you guys
