lot of these clothes did get sent to me
which I'm so grateful and so thankful
for and in fact I have hooked you guys
up with a lot of discount codes in this
video so I'm not getting paid for the
video area
I just want to film it because I love
fashion and I love showing you guys so
yeah just everyone so the first place I
picked up a lot of clothing I'm not
gonna show it all in this whole because
I seriously picked up like 16 pieces but
there will be a snapchat hold for all
the items I picked up from this shop on
my snapchat tonight I think it should be
live so scan is to you add me on
snapchat or my snapchat name is just
Ronnie
to see the full hole and everything I
picked up from naked I didn't even tell
you guys what store it's from its from
maker it's from an online store called
it naked disclaimer if you get annoyed
by words being repeated over and over
again I really apologize maybe John was
just video
I'm going to be saying obsessed loving
adore absolutely love a lot isn't video
just a heads up last thing I picked up
from naked is one of my favorite
clothing items out of this whole
interested in general it is this super
bright super beautiful place suit here
first of all can we just talk about the
coloring of this place we I love how
bright it is and how orange it is orange
is one of my favorite colors so I
actually think this was awesome for a
summer dress even though we're in winter
in Australia it's not like it's been to
here so it is just a low front place
suit which also clips up at the front so
you can adjust how high or how low you
want it and then it is completely
backless which I love I absolutely love
backless clothing it is one of my
favorite things and it has these awesome
bell sleeves which I don't really earn a
lot of clothing with bell sleeves but I
love the look of it I picked this up
because I go to Phuket in two days and I
really wanted to wear this over there
I think it's so bright and so beautiful
and colorful for a holiday and yeah I
just can't wait to get some awesome
photos in there the next time I have to
show you guys I fell in love on the
website so it has to pick it up it's
just this Shaya nude at the top it's
almost like a blouse but it's completely
sheer completely see-through this top is
another one that also has the bell
sleeves and I think the thing I love
about this top is towards the bottom up
the sleeves and the bottom of the top
the fabric just starts to layer so it
gives like a really cool effect but I
just love how elegant and girly and
pretty it is and then I picked up this
jumper or Americans would say it's wet
out here from it naked this jumper gives
me so many 90s feels it's just a plain
basic black sweater and it also has a
turtleneck which I really love the thing
I love about this it is so simple but so
cool it has this super down front and
the zipper is actually a circle which
has a really cool touch and yeah I like
it I like it a lot I'll quickly talk
about the outfit I'm wearing now this is
just a black ribbed knit dress so it's
just a plain turtleneck a black knit a
dress I love this it is so comfy and I
feel like this is just a good go-to
dress to just chuck on and head out the
door if you're in a rush
yeah I love this and I think
be perfect for winter and the last piece
of clothing I'm going to show you guys
from naked is this bra here is just a
mesh white see-through Briella
with this really pretty floral detailing
on the actual bralette unfortunately I
can't show you guys this arm because it
is completely see-through but free the
nipple the next online store I picked up
some pieces from is an online store
called Bumba I really hope I'm
pronouncing that right I'm pretty sure
it's pronounced bumper swim if I'm
butchering that it's gone forgive me but
this is an online store that two of my
lovely friends aren't and they have
gifted me at some pieces to wear and
stuff like that in some photos and stuff
and I go to Phuket in two days as I
mentioned before so this is like perfect
timing so the first item I got is a
bikini and it's just this Navy bikini
here first of all can we please talk
about the design on the top of this this
is incredible I've never seen a bikini
top like this I'm so excited to wear
this in Phuket and I love the coloring
of it as well and this is the bottoms
here they're just super cheeky and yeah
the next thing is that this champagne
it's high up dressed I absolutely love
this style of this dress at the moment I
see them floating around and to be
completely honest I do own a few of
these silk tie out dresses and the
quality of this is incredible like when
I felt it I was like oh my god you can't
early tell it is 110% amazing quality
because the other ones I have just
daren't say right and they're not very
good quality but this is incredible I
love the color of it it was just this
gorgeous golden champagne shade I love
the material it is so soft and yeah I
just love how it looks on and the last
thing I got is this amazing black dress
this is another tie up dress
once again the quality is incredible you
can tell it's good quality because it
was
heavy this also has the beautiful bell
sleeves on it I love the design of this
I love the feel and it is just amazing
now I have to loss clothing items to
show you guys before I get into the
accessories I picked these two things up
from princess pulley a very familiar
side I'm sure many of you know it the
first item I picked up from princess
Polly is this dusty pink crop tie up top
crop top I picked this up because I feel
like this is a really good throw on like
to throw it over my bikinis if I want to
go out and pre-cut somewhere but I don't
feel like wearing anything too heavy it
is super light material and I also love
the fact that you can dress this up and
dress this down and the last clothing
item I have to share with you guys in
this hole is this black denim jacket as
I said we are going into winter at the
moment sir I love denim jackets I have
so many but I don't have a black or this
is like a dot where you're always black
I don't have one this color so I really
wanted to get my hands on it I love how
retro and gravy this is it gets like a
really cool vibe and yeah you can never
go wrong with the Democrats is freaking
weekend but another part I'm super
excited for I have picked up so many
accessories over the past three weeks
because it came to my realization I have
no accessories and when I do I have like
the one statement piece necklace and a
pair of earrings so the past two weeks
I've gone crazy on the accessories I
have so many accessories now so yeah
let's jump into it all the accessories I
picked up now starting off with
sunglasses I am seriously a sunglass
holder
I have saw many sunglasses it is
ridiculous like not one human being
should aren't that many sunglasses but I
do now the first thing I want to share
with you guys is one of my favorite
pairs of sunglasses ever in fact it is
my favorite pair of sunglasses ever I
storing these in silver and they were
like my right outside sunglasses I jump
into GTM I had too much fun I got a
little crazy
I jumped on a friend and as I jumped on
him my sunglasses ran away and I think
someone's ran past and like picked him
up and ran off sorry I lost him and I
was so devastated off Shani I was like a
mess because I had lost my favorite
Sunny's so I decided to pick them up
again but they only had gold which I'm
Charlie finding they look the exact same
but the only thing is I feel like you
can't find these anywhere
line I really feel like they're like a
limited edition or limited stock which
is so annoying but I think these are
from it naked so thank you so much naked
save my cell you have literally like
you've won my heart so this is what they
look like here I'm sure all of you guys
have seen this in my festival makeup
look but I just absolutely love them
they are so comfy and the thing I love
is I can drive the things on because
they don't have a huge science and I
find it very difficult to drive it with
sunny Leone I love it the next night I
picked up my from princess Polly sorry I
actually picked these up because they
are very similar to these ones I just
showed you and because I had lost them I
was devastated so I was on a hunch I
find some very similar this is what they
look like here these ones in fact asuma
although these do look very similar they
are a lot better and they have a
reflective Franks
but yeah I actually really love these
ones they're just that little bit bigger
than the ones I just showed you but I
love them the last pair of sunnies I
have to share with you guys are from
naked as well and they are these ones
here these are totally the perfect 70s
Sunny's ever I love how big the lenses
are I don't own any like this so they
reflect like orange green and yellow and
yeah I just think that's very stylish so
cool and I feel like they were just like
look really good with a simple outfit
you know are you guys ready for the
amount of jewelry I have the beautiful
Courtney at mink collections sent me a
bunch of jewelry and main collections is
one of my favorite online jewelry stores
so this is the first pair of earrings I
got I've never seen anything like this
before
I love how like edgy and cool they go
there they're just these triangle
earrings I don't really know how to buy
them yeah this is what they look like
the next thing I got are these ones here
these are my ride-or-die earrings these
are my absolute favorites like my number
one favorite earrings ever I wore these
in my prom and makeup look and these are
just absolutely amazing I didn't even
have words for them like they're that
beautiful I feel like if I was an
earring this would be me the last pair
of earrings I got from mink collections
are these ones here I don't actually
know what they're supposed to be I feel
like they look like moons
upside-down burns but I'm totally wrong
I know that on but that's just what I
like to imagine they oh but I love how
elegant and sympathy is odd and yeah
once again I do get so many pieces from
main collections or I'll be here all day
showing you guys so I'm just showing you
my few papers so the last thing I want
to share with you guys is this trick
here wait let me fix it I love this on
it is story edgy and so cool it just has
these two chains on the side and then
two chains and then in the middle it has
a dangling crystal I haven't won this
one yet I still get to wear it because I
feel like this is the necklace you have
to wear with one of the most simple
outfits ever because it's just like
sorry I'm standing and I try to wear
this with earrings but it just clashes
too much because it is so big yeah other
than that I love it so much
the next earrings are these ones here
which you guys would really like Ronnie
there are no fricking earrings on there
but they are they are clear which I
absolutely think is so cool absolutely
those Antonis we're absolutely in there
they are just these that clear ball
heads I'm pretty sure they're ball heads
but these are so cool I'm so excited to
wear them out so actually gonna wear
them today but I feel like these ones
are just like more prints I had to yeah
these are so cool and I can totally see
these me one of my favorites so the next
part I got from naked and these are
these hanging crescent moons but I love
how simple and elegant these are and I
just think that's so cool I have a few
rings on that I want to show you guys I
have this little cute
star one and this is from me collection
and then I have this little cute fox
head which is from some folks and then I
have these three triangle rings at which
I saw the Sun folks as well okay last
piece of jury I have to share with you
guys is this tricky here I love this in
my recent veneering I picked this up
from the Sun folks as well I've never
seen anything like it it is so cool and
so pretty it has this really big tassel
at the front and I just feel like this
is such a statement piece like it just
blows my mind it is gorgeous
next accessory after shower you guys
it's just this Westin double buckle belt
I am sure you got to sing these floating
around for ages I actually have one of
these but it doesn't fit me and it's so
big
sorry I have never worn I got at about a
year agree and then it decided to grow
legs and walk off I love the effective
look
and I got this from Princess Louise and
the last thing I got from princess Polly
is this maybe scuff this has just got
tiny little stars all over it I love
this too bit I think it's so cool and it
just looks like different you know so
when I saw it I was like you in my
closet now for the next thing I have to
show you guys is this bag here this is
just a crossover bag or the way I do
wear it on one shoulder and yep just hit
myself in the head I thought this would
make it as well I love how simple this
is it's just got go detailing it's just
a simple rectangle bag and it's really
roomy as a got a lot of space in there I
got this for pre-cut as well just to
like throw things in and going because
it's like a good size it's not too big
it's not too small and I love how this
is like an off like it's like a dark mom
or gray kind of color and the last three
things I have to share with you guys our
hats now I walked into general pants the
other day with my boyfriend and he was
just looking around for a few shirts and
I came across these hats
it was a buy one get one free so they
were facing those two and usually
they're 50 dollars so I was like
cha-ching now I'm sure a lot of you know
that I love wearing my fall and break
and straight heart which is just one of
those see hats like it looks like a
sailor hat pretty much a black one it's
a little ship on it so I picked up two
of those sorry I got a plain black one
which just has a plain room around the
front I love a simple plain black one
and the full of broken straight one is
actually really small for my head I have
a big head if you have it on for about
20 minutes and it gives me the worst
headache so I really wanted one that's
comfy that I can wear all the time so I
start this plane a black one so then I
