my channel
so today I'm bringing my first about
Halloween tutorial on my channel I was
so excited to film this video because I
love doing different makeup looks and
special effects makeup
I don't do it a lot but when I do do it
I really really enjoy it
so today I created this dangerous
werewolf Halloween makeup look with
gashes out of my neck this video is
inspired by and my makeup I saw her
tutorial and I fell in love with it so I
had to recreate it for myself and Javier
was inspired by Krispies so I laid
bright the videos links below if you
want to check them out so if you'd like
to see how to get this really simple
pretty first date makeup look and then
please keep on watching and let's jump
into it I'm totally joking but let's go
so we're gonna jump straight into it
today I'm starting off with a freshly
washed and clean face take 3 sorry I was
filming for about 3 hours and then
stuffed it out so I had to start all
over again so I'm going to start by
blocking out the tails of my brows now
I'm going to measure where I want the
brow to stop flicking up towards my
temple and then anything under that I'm
going to start blocking it out I'm going
to be using and the Too Faced shadow
insurance glitter glow to do this you
can use a glue stick if you don't have a
glitter glue but when I do this for
Halloween I think I'm going to use a
glue stick instead because I found that
the glitter glue kind of went tacky and
crusty almost it went really like dry
and I'm using the end of some tweezers
to do this and then I'm just going ahead
and setting the glitter glue with some
translucent powder just so it stops it
from being tacky although it did that
ends up being tacky in the end but this
will prevent it a little bit
and I'm just going ahead and applying
some foundation this is the Chi Chi
fabulous and flawless foundation by the
way all the products I use if I don't
show them all mention them will be
listed below oh my god I saw that in my
mirror and it scared the hell out of me
I'm gonna fix that up in two seconds I
just have to quickly blend out my
foundation and then I'm just going ahead
and blending my foundation out with a
damp Beauty Blender and then I'm just
also taking that foundation are you
aware I pluck down the brows just so
everything blends in nicely together now
I'm taking a light concealer to
highlight under my eyes down the bridge
of my nose on my Cupid's bow and on my
forehead this is just going to make
everything look a little bit more awake
and brightened and then I'm just going
ahead and blending everything out with
his a Beauty Blender and making sure
that there are no harsh lines
and not just taking the banana shade out
of my Allison Jade at canto palette I'm
going to set under my eyes and down the
bridge of my nose so everything stays
highlighted and it doesn't crease and
then I'm going ahead and just setting
the rest of my face with my Australis
fresh and flawless and pressed powder in
the shade darkest Brown now this is
where I get excited because we get to
move on to the fun stuff so moving on to
the brows I just want to quickly say I
do swap between two products I swap
between a brow pencil by Mac and the
Anastasio dip brow pomade in the shade
of soft brown so I'm cutting through my
art and extending my brow out towards my
temple so I'm pretty much just making
the shape that my heart desires so you
can go with any shape any thickness and
whatever and then I'm just gonna go
ahead and fill it in now taking up my
Anastasio dip brow I'm going to start oh
and the Mac pencil I literally swap
between these two so much so I'm going
to start feathering the brows and making
hairlike strokes just to make them look
a lot more fluffy and hairy and sorry
I'm actually so happy with how the brows
turns out and then I'm just taking a
brow gel and brushing all the hairs up
so that they stick to my skin and they
make them look a little fairy and fluffy
moving on to their eyes I'm taking
makeup peeks creme brulee and just
working this through my crease as my
transition shade and then I'm going in
with makeup geeks mocha and cocoa bear
I'm taking a mixture of both of these
and I'm going to start blending this
through the crease and I'm going it's
super crazy with this I'm going quite
heavy-handed
I'm also going to be flicking it out
towards my template to get more of a cat
eye and elongated look and now I'm just
going in with a dark chocolate brown and
I'm applying this on the inner corners
and out of V of my eyes I'm kind of
doing like a halo eyes so I'm just going
to be blending that three and always
make sure you have a clean blending
brush on the side just to blend
everything out so that there are no
harsh lines as DJ colored would say
blending is key and now I'm just taking
this photo eye shadow by makeup geek in
the shaded grandstands and applying that
on the center of my lid just to add a
little bit more shimmer to the look now
I'm just taking some concealer and
cleaning up those harsh lines of eye
shadow you don't have to do this I just
wanted to make it look a little bit more
intense and fierce and to give more of a
werewolf vibe I'm going to be taking a
really dark brown eye shadow and I'm
going to be extending the inner corners
and making them look a lot more pointed
this is going to enlarge the eyes and
make them look a lot more exaggerated
and opened and kind of like that cat eye
wolf dog look sorry I just went ahead
and applied some falsies and mascara to
my top and bottom lashes now I'm going
to go crazy with the contouring now this
is where the whole werewolf vibe is
going to start appearing sorry I'm
taking the Mac protein powder in the
shade to refined it gold I would suggest
using a warm base bronzer for this
because it would just match look a whole
lot better so if you love contouring if
this is your time to go crazy with it
I'm taking the contour on my cheekbones
from my ear and I'm bringing it all the
way down to my mouth I'm stopping just
before my mouth and I'm putting a lot of
bronzer throughout my hairline and on my
forehead
and I'm also taking this along my jaw
line to make that look a lot more
defined
and to contour the nose I'm taking a lot
of bronzer on my brush and I'm not going
to be blending this out because this is
going to make the nose really stand out
so I'm doing this quite intense and
making my nose look a super-thin now I'm
taking the makeup geek eyeshadow in the
shade of Coco bear now you want to make
sure you have a really light hand when
you do this because it is quite a dark
intense color so I'm just going ahead
and really covering out the cheekbones
and give me more of a structured look
and to give a lot more depth onto the
forehead
I'm taking quite a lot of this into the
hairline and onto the sides of the
forehead and just opening up the shading
and after you get that werewolf look I'm
taking a brown liquid liner and I'm
applying this to a really small detailer
angle brush and I'm just going to be
doing a tiny little hairlike strokes
onto my cheekbones sorry I'm doing
voiceovers and my kitten just came to
cuddle and she's purring so loud so he
can hear that I'm terribly sorry
now I'm going to be shading hairlike
strokes onto my forehead now I'm
stopping between the liquid liner and an
eyeshadow to do this so some will be a
lot less harsh than others I'm also
going to be taking that quite far down
into my forehead it just to kind of
exaggerated the hairline a lot more now
I'm just going ahead and shooting the
tip of my nose with a dark brown eye
shadow to make it look more animal-like
and then I'm just going in with the ice
rod you Jimmy highlighter and just
highlighting the high points of my face
and I went quite intense with this
because I thought it would look really
cool when you make a look
and to finish off with the lips I think
this makeup look looks perfect and with
a dark brown lip or an ashy bramlett so
I'm taking the Mac the lipstick in the
shade of styrene and just applying that
all over my lips and lastly I decided to
bronze up the look a lot more because I
thought it wasn't looking at brunch
turn-off so I went in with Mac's go
deposit and pretty much just apply this
all over my face and just intensely it
bronzed up my cheeks and everything else
so if you want to stop there and only do
the makeup for Halloween that is
perfectly fine but if you want to get
gory and crazy like me then I will show
you how I do the gashes out of my neck
sorry I'm starting out with a light
brown eye shadow and I'm just going to
be mapping out where I want the
scratches to be you can do these
anywhere you can do them on your neck on
your chest on your shoulders but I
thought it would be perfect to do it
across the collarbones once you're happy
with where they're going to be at this
is where we get funky so here I'm taking
the been nine nose and scar wax and I'm
going to be applying this onto these
scratches now I recommend if you're
using this make sure your hands are
moisturized or you have a baby wipe with
you to make your hands voiced because
this stuff is supposed to hear and it
takes like crazy and also on top of that
make sure you don't have any moisturizer
on your chest because otherwise it's not
going to stick and it's going to be a
nightmare sorry I'm just rolling this up
until they don't like spaghetti strips
and then applying that onto my chest
where the scratch is going to be and I'm
using the back of a tweezers to press
this down you can use a spatula or
anything just make sure it is flat and
it is also moisturized otherwise it's
just going to stick to that true
once I have that Oh lay down I'm just
going in with the back of the tweezers
and making sure all the edges are firmly
pressed into my skin and smoothed out
now I'm taking my foundation on a Beauty
Blender and I'm just working that
everybody's sky wax this is just going
to blend everything into my skin and
make it not look fake and make it look
like actual skin and now I'm just taking
the other side of the tweezers and I'm
cutting into the sky wax where I want
the word to be open now I didn't
moisturize at the end of the tweezers
for this and it was so hard it kept
ripping and stuff so I recommend
moisturizing it or using a bobby pin
it's something that isn't as thick or
crazy as tweezers and now for the super
fun and gory stuff I absolutely love
this stuff so I'm taking the Ben 9 cuts
and bruises color wheel and I'm taking
the really dark red and I'm mixing it
with a bit of purple and I'm going to be
applying this where the wounds are open
this is going to give the wounds a lot
more depth and make them look really
thick and deep
now I'm going in with a red and purple
eyeshadow and I'm going to start shading
this around the outside of the wounds
and the scar wax this is just going to
make them look really red and raw and
really inflamed and like really sore
sorry I'm just shading this in between
the scallops on either side of the
wounds and now I'm taking the bright red
shade from the Ben ninth color wheel and
I'm going to apply these where the wings
have been freshly scratched open this is
just going to give more of a bloody
effect and make the blood look really
fresh and yeah I'm sorry about
explaining things and this is where I
get so excited because this is where
 gets real so I'm taking the Ben 9
dark blood and I'm going to start
focusing this in the wounds so where it
is cut open and where it is Dave I'm
going to put a lot of the blood in there
just to make it look even more gory and
real and bloody sorry I'm going crazy
with this I kind of went a little
overboard but that gave more of like a
scary look and by the way this is sort
messy so it lay down a towel or
something I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video I have so much fun filming it
I literally am obsessed with it and I
think this is what I'm going to do for
Halloween this year if you do recreate
this look please don't forget to send me

video a thumbs up and subscribe if
