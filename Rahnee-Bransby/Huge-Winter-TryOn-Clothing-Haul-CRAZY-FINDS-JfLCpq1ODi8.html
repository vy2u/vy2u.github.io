my channel so today I decided to fill my
clothing hopefully guys I feel like I
haven't on one of these in a while and
at one point I was pumping these out
once a week so we're getting back into
it you guys have been requesting them
like crazy for this - is this clothing
for today is going to be based around
winter pieces because as you may know we
are going into winter in Australia so
I'm just going to jump straight into it
today so I really hope you guys enjoy
and forgive this video thumbs up for
more holes and what's this jump straight
into it look for the first place I
picked up a few pieces is naked you guys
know one of my favorite online clothing
stores by the way I think I have a
discount rate for all of these places I
know two of them I definitely do so I
will leave all my just down below if you
guys are interested in purchasing
something and you've seen this haul or
just something of the website and you
want to save a little bit of bulk so
yeah come home Australia there's a
little bit of us a little bit about
pocket abates
okay so class thing I picked up from
naked is something I don't own and I
never ironed so I was so excited to get
this it is just a denim trenchcoat now I
love to look at this online so I had to
get anything denim I'm obsessed with I'm
talking exact class today because I'm so
excited I'm just in such a good mood
like when I'm in a really good mood I
talk a million miles an hour and then I
can't breed by men I can't breathe thank
you when I saw this for some reason I
thought this would look so cool standing
in the street of America in a denim
trench coat I don't know why I thought I
would look cool but I'm going to America
soon so I'll probably get that photo I
feel like this is just so classy and it
is such a perfect piece if you want to
look really really overdressed or really
classy or I don't know it's lovely with
the trench coat I've never Ariane's like
I feel like I have this conversation in
every single videos but I originally
thought I was cool until every time I
meet some of you guys I hope you guys
are always like oh my god yes Lord Ludo
I'm like oh and then I send it to like
Shaunie and stuff and realize I'm not as
tall as I think I am so that's the
reason why I haven't really earned any
trench coats because I think I'm through
shoulder them but this one looks so good
on and I was like I've honestly worn all
of these so that all inside-out
you guys probably focus in my previous
video because I wore in that but this is
just a pink sweater and it says Miami on
the front I thought this was so so cute
and so I don't know I just loved it I
wouldn't really lean towards anything
that looks like this but I'm obsessed
with it and every time I wear it I get
so many compliments on it I wrote this
because I think this would look so cool
with an all-white outfit in a really
dark tan and it's just one of those
pieces that you can totally wear casual
or you can dress it up I've also been
leaning towards buying a lot more
sweaters because last year when it came
to winter I had no winter clothes I
froze my butt off so I decided this year
it would be a good idea to pick up a lot
and a lot of winter clothes I feel like
you can never go wrong with like
Chucky's or sweaters because you just
never know when you need to weather to
be honest especially in Australia
because one day it's 90 degrees
in the other day it's like minus five so
in thank you
the nice thing I picked up is a black
denim pair of mom jeans that justic not
about I did just wear these and I can't
be what they're taking that off but that
is from dull - if any of you were
wondering anyway these are my new
favorite pair of jeans they are so nice
on they look so nice they're not
uncomfortable at all they're such a
comfy pair of jeans I didn't own one
pair of black jeans can you believe that
out of every single piece of clothing
item I own I don't own black jeans so I
decided to get my pair a mum pet so I
decided to get my pair a month so I
decided to get my pair of mum style pair
jeans does that make sense mom jeans oh
so I decided to get my pair a mum you
know what I mean I'm laughing so hard I
was try to figure out why this wasn't
making sense and it's because I was
saying so I decided to get my pair
instead of I decided to get myself a
pair I tried so many times I was like
why does this not make sense
kostik me really loves at wearing baggy
jeans I think they look so cool
especially with a crop top and I've had
these for about a week now and I've worn
them every single day so I know it's
complaining I don't fix up this silky
black button up another thing that I
realized I don't own because I actually
went to an event
two weeks Larry and they told me to wear
all black and I had nothing that was
really nice and dressy and black and I
was like oh my god imagine if I had a
black button up right now that would be
perfect so I decided to get this one
because I think this is a piece that
would be such a grocery that I learn a
lot the thing I love about this
button-up instance leaves are like a
little frill I think they add such a
cute touch but this is story nice I was
on the weekend with those black jeans
and so I fell and it looked so so cool
and I just saw that I think I'm going to
get a lot of wear out of this moving on
the nice thing at the top is this really
thin that must be yellow long sleeves
I love this color at the moment I've
been obsessed with the color yellow and
orange I don't know why well our engines
my favorite color ever but I've been
obsessed with the color yellow I think
it's because we're coming into winter so
ever decides to wear like blacks and
grays and Sal colors so I'm like why
don't I sit up with a pop of color the
next thing I got is another long sleeve
this is just a black long sleeve and the
thing I really love about this is it has
flames down the side I've been seeing a
lot of words with flames on at the
moment and I love it I think it is so
cool it adds like a really cool edgy
touch to the look and I really like as
well the neckline sells killer on it now
if you don't know a killer is like one
of my most known words that I say a kind
of song as like a piss-take like me and
my friends is always all about killer or
kilo but now I say all the time like
whenever I hear of some that I really
like I'm like this is a killer song or
if I see a shirt that I like I just kind
of like a really popular one in my
vocabulary but yeah this is really cool
and I comics wear it I haven't won one
yet thank you the next shot I got isn't
really winter related but I just wanted
to show you guys because I love
this shirt it is so nice and I wore it
in one of my Instagram photos and it got
so many questions I'll see where it was
from but if it's just a plain white
basic tee and it has roses on the front
and says teaser in yellow I'll draw the
color scheme obvious like the red the
green and the yellow I think it is so
pretty and roses are my favorite flowers
on earth like roses which is my favorite
thing ever but this top is so cute
I've literally been living in this as
well and I just think it is the door and
the last thing from makers that I'm
showing in this haul is a pair of shoes
now I wanted a pair of these shoes for
so so so long I
we want the Gucci ones but I can't bring
myself to spending $800 on a pair of
shoes so that's on the brand Henry Cole
they make the cooler shoes about them
very similar to the Gucci ones although
they haven't black so instead they're
just like little mules I think they call
i think the corn mules
I've been living in issues since I got
them I think they are so cool and so
classy and I love them follow these I
feel like they're very um like olden day
styles for some reason I don't know I
think that straw I picked up a few
things from is misguided now actually
before I started filming this video I
got a knock on the door and it was a
package and let me just show you just
hold on a sec I've already opened it to
take three pairs of shoes out because I
couldn't wait but um yeah I received
this huge art package from his guidance
so if you guys want to see in separate
closing holes definitely let me know
because I would do a misguided haul but
holy crap it is so heavy like just crazy
so the first thing I picked up these
trackies now these are so cool so they
are track is but they're made to be worn
really really dressy I love the bottom
of these that they are super freight and
they also flare out and the really cool
thing is around the waist it actually
has two parts like your child so it
looks like you're wearing a pair of
track is underneath when I got these I
tried them on and I was like holy crap I
want to live in these I'll say this is
the London and misguided collaboration
if you haven't seen their stuff you have
to check them out the London
collaboration is amazing I've gotten a
lot of thing from this collaboration and
it's literally so cool it is honestly of
awesome speaking of the London X in the
skater collaboration I also picked up
this top and this top is my favorite top
that I've ever owned I think this is
really cool high net sleeves are also
really really big and flare out I love
the back of this top it has like kind of
an open back and the tire piece at the
back house is really cool detailing and
oh my god this top is just so so cool
and obsessed with it I've got a black
pair of petra misguided now these are
just your typical black dress has these
have the most awesome
frill detailing at the bottom so it has
this huge like frill or like fell
through I'm not too sure what that style
is but they're so cool I think this
would look so cool with that white top
or even just like a little
black crop and like a red leather jacket
that looks awesome but I don't really
have any black jersey pants so I wanted
to get these because they looked so cool
online and they're really flattering as
well the last piece that I picked up
from misguided once again is their
winter related but I wanted to share it
with you guys anyway because it is so
cool I would have flipped Thanks so cool
and you'd like me describing work anyway
I got this fake red leather skirt now
this is sorry I think I saw this online
and I was like oh my god and SS with the
color red recently as well and I
actually wore this in a photo on my
Instagram with that white top I just
showed you I love how edgy and like
goodbye to this looks I also love the
belt it has this really awesome stud
detailing along the belt and about isn't
actually attached to the scope which is
really really cool so you can take it
out and wear it on another piece of
clothing or you can wear like a
different belt with this and the last
place that I'm going to be mentioning in
this haul that I picked up a few pieces
from is pepper mayor's I just saw it
across our website and they have the
coolest stuff and of course I have a
discount code for you guys so I'll leave
that links color in the description but
the first thing I got from pesto Mayo is
this jumper I'm wearing at the moment
this is by the brand of the raged
priests now I'm obsessed with this brand
I've always wanted to learn something
from their brand because they have the
coolest clothing and I'm so excited that
this is the first piece I own because it
is honestly so cool
so it is this yellowy orange crop
sweater as I love the color of it it is
so vibrant and so out there it is so so
incredibly soft I actually received this
today and I put it on to try it on and I
was like yes I'm wearing this for the
video because in so soft the next thing
I got is another cropped sweater with
huge please this is just a plain black
like different material sweater I got
this because I just wanted a plain black
crop knitted jumper just to throw on
when I'm wearing jeans or like trackies
sort of so thick so it is where to keep
you so so warm which I'm so grateful for
and yeah I just think it is awesome it's
not like a typical black sweater I love
that across and the sleeves are really
big as well and the last thing I picked
up that I'll be showing you in this hall
are these really awesome camel tan color
corduroy pants now I can actually try
these on it because I've been doing too
many squats and nothing is fitting class
Maibaum anymore
oh my god Excel and I didn't even
realize I think I'm going to slow down
on the squat because I got these in a
size six and a size six it doesn't go
past my bum but a size eight doesn't fit
my waist because it is too big but I was
so excited to get these so I was hoping
for a size eight they are so cool and so
vintage I think these would look awesome
with like a little crop or even that
black crouch-jump that I have corduroy
pants let's throw in at the moment and
it excites me because I remember when I
was like five and my dad used to wear
these because like that was the fashion
so that is everything that I picked up
recently for my winter closet I really
hope you guys enjoy this hole and if you
see it please don't forget to give that
a massive thumbs up and subscribe if
you're new we are so close to 100k it is
rude we are so close to 100 K it is

magical day and obviously cool very fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
