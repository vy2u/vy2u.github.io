even look like me
hey everyone
so welcome back to my channel today I
decided to film a vlog I really didn't
want to start it in the car I wanted to
like take you guys out for breakfast
with me and stuff but I meaning me I'm
sorry brushed I literally my appointment
is in my appointment in 10 minutes and
takes me at least 25 minutes together
awesome oh my god my camera's gonna die
wait so my camera's gonna die I'm gonna
be like 15 minutes late and we're not
driving hurry up I'm going to the
hedgerow so now to get my hands on I'm
actually getting something done at very
different usually I would go in for like
foil to get my hair lightened or
darkened too many or what I want but
today I'm getting something different
I'm getting a change I'm very nervous
but we'll see how it goes
I actually just finished filming and I'm
supposed to be at the hairdresser's at
10 past 1 it is now 101 and it takes me
about 25 minutes to get there so I'm
running extra late but hey welcome to my
car I've always wanted to do a vlog
where I am driving and like talking to
you guys and I've never done one before
I really wanna like
and all right hey series like been
driving with Ronnie but I'm not very
interesting I mean something really
interesting about me and I don't know
what he talk about cars bring the penis
I don't actually know why I'm not
telling you guys what I'm doing because
you're going to read the title I'm
dyeing my hair like silvery white I've
always wanted to go like not great but
like I've always wanted to go silver
I've been putting it off for so long now
though I was like once I turn 18 I might
go silver in a few weeks I'm going to go
silver and today's the day where I'm
like today I'm going to go so well so
it's not going to be permanent only
because I'm scared in case of just a
little peak second tutorial it's not
going to be permanent just because I'm
sad if I don't look good so it's only
going to be temporary and if I end up
loving it then I will great moment but I
think it's going to be temporary because
then I can always get my color back okay
now you guys are sweating so I get my
hair done at a salon called circles of
Subiaco which is in to be a creeper I've
been going there for I think a year now
and oh my god I cannot recommend you
services to be accurate enough
hey I seriously just so amazing like the
girls I worked there as there's like
hair dress so the girl that does my hair
you suggest and we are actually really
good friends
since I turn 18 I became really good
friends which is pretty good she's so
funny
but she is like a hip goddess like she
can do anything and everything like you
should see how bright is actually scary
she is amazing this is my hairdresser
gel
I literally have the us bladder I was so
excited by the now getting done because
we need to latch in my hair before we
can do it still though we have to get up
the ladder like the ladders it can be
because I'm great so have some so we're
going to do
Oh
Oh
hey guys so it is the next day I
couldn't feel when I got home last night
because by the time I got home and by
the time I got through of the traffic it
was pitch black so you wouldn't be able
to see my head properly so this is the
finished result I'm seriously obsessed
with it I'm just sorry happy with how it
turned out I love it to bits the cows
have kind of dropped it was Kelly
yesterday but they're kind of shots now
into like ways it will eventually
lighten as well once I turn it and stop
but I'm seriously so happy with it I
didn't think it would come out this
amazing sorry I just want to thank
circles and just for doing my hair she
always does an amazing job if you want
to check them out where you interested
in getting your head on somewhere
amazing I had to recommend SEP so I'll
leave the links below so yeah I really
hope you guys like my new hair - it's
nice of a change every once in a while
and I was kind of getting sick of my
blonde so I thought let's go solo I
really hope you guys enjoyed this vlog
if you did please don't forget about
multiple uploads in the future and I'd
love to get your comments about my hair
and yeah I'll see you my next year bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
