my channel so today I have an exciting
new video so if you're following me on
snapchat you would definitely know that
I got something done to my face now it's
not anything major it's not like Botox
on my lips or a nose job or anything
like that
I got my eyebrows tattooed on you're
probably thinking Ronnie why did you get
permanent makeup or why did you get your
eyebrows tattooed on
but don't worry it's a technique called
feather tattooing so it is not permanent
so I decided to make a video based
around my experience the program
progressed the person has to have it
done and I asked you guys oh my god I'm
losing my voice so I wanted to sit down
today I'm from a video to tell you guys
about my experience the process does it
hurt the cost how long it lasts and
stuff like that and I also took to
Instagram to ask you guys to ask me
questions about feather tattooing and
you have some stuff that you wanted to
know for the purpose of today's video I
didn't bought any brats in my brows
apart from and I read Joe just because I
wanted you guys to see what it looks
like so this is how they look without
anything on it this is how they were
look when I take my makeup off so yeah
so starting with where I got them done
so I got them done at Alyson J's salon
in Claremont if you're from Perth I'll
situated my eyebrows but they do you
have other stylist which also makes for
cuffs very which I'll get onto it next
the price of getting your eyebrows
another test food you know to get my I
just I said I brother now I'm very very
lucky I was lucky not to get my eyebrows
done complimentary because Allison and I
have been friends for quite a while she
actually reached out to me a few months
ago to just start waxing my eyebrows and
then she offered to get them feather
tattooed so I'm very very lucky to get
this done for free
but Aston charges $1,000 for the
treatment and an $80 cancellation fee
but as I said before she does have other
stylists there they charge at $600 now
I'm going to be telling you guys about
the process of getting your eyebrows
feather tattooed so Alison starts the
treatment by putting a numbing cream on
your eyebrows this stays on there for
half an hour and this just helps with
the discomfort of getting your eyebrows
tattooed it is not a very pretty look I
wouldn't start a photo here it looks
like when you do have the cream on once
that has sat for half an hour Alison
then takes the cream off and then she
discusses the shape the thickness the
color she goes through all of that with
you and think I actually really liked
about the way allison did it is she
feels in your eyebrows and draws them
onto how you like them just to see what
they look like once you have discussed
the shape and the darkness and all that
sort of stuff she then starts the
treatment the treatment including the
hot now for the numbing cream I'm pretty
sure it goes for an hour and a half
caught it just in time
and the way feather tattooing is done is
just by creating tiny little lines to
create hair like lines after the
treatment is done you buy a cream for
your eyebrows now for your eyebrows the
cream you use is an ointment now it is
called I can't I joined a handsome
handsome Ben wait Ben person's been
husband now the ointment you actually
use for your eyebrows is a nappy rash
cream for babies so Alta Allison has
done your eyebrows she'll pop that on
your eyebrows and you actually have to
keep that on your eyebrows for seven
days straight or five to seven days you
can't let your eyebrows dry out because
then it causes of stabbing and then it
can cause desire and stuff like that so
you have to make sure your eyebrows are
moist for the next five to seven days
which I found quite tricky oh and also
you can't put anything else in your
eyebrows you can't put any makeup in
your eyebrows for those days you just
have to let them be free after the first
treatment you do have to go back for
touch-ups because the ointment does make
the tattooing trade a little bit because
it isn't permanent sorry I'm going for
my touch-up very soon so mine have faded
a lot since I got them first done my
first whole treatment on my eyebrows I'm
just
incredibly happy with I think they look
amazing it takes so much time with my
hands now because usually I would take
25 minutes to fill in my eyebrows and
now I literally don't even have to fill
them and I just at the door sorry I'm
sorry obsessed with how they look I've
had so many compliments on them and I
cannot recommend feathers tattooing
enough if you guys are very insecure
about your eyebrows or you don't they're
not naturally full or you don't have
much shape to them
definitely definitely look into giving
up eyebrows for the tattoo because it is
so worth the money and it is amazing and
it saves so much time which I'm so glad
about so I think I quickly covered
everything I wanted to share with you
guys about for the tattooing before
answering your questions so now I'm
going to go to my Instagram post and as
some of the questions you guys asked so
the first question which I got awesome
most and which tells most excited to
answer is did it hurt now when it comes
to pain I'm such a
I can feel pain like anything so on a
scale of 10 it probably heard about
seven to eight to me it kind of just
feels like a knife and digging into your
skin and then slowly ripping it it did
hurt for me but for some people it
doesn't hurt oh yeah and I forgot to
mention that she does three rounds of
the feather tattooing so after the first
round the pain wasn't as bad but for me
it did hurt because anything hurts for
me literally someone can touch me and
I've like did they peel badly after and
how often do you have to go get them
redone so no they do not pill because of
the ointment that I put on I mean if you
don't get the ointment on or you don't
follow the correct steps they will start
to scab and pill but mine didn't mind
healed very well and very very nicely
and how often do you have to get them
redone it is really up to you depending
on how dark or how thick or how intense
you want them I will probably get mine
done to about three to three times
but yeah it just depends on how much
they fade and how many touch-ups you
need but it is very very personal when
it comes to that it all depends on you
can you please include before-and-after
photos now me
the little bugger i am i don't think i
got a office furniture I would try go
through my camera roll but this is how
they look after they have healed if I
drew have one hopefully I got one I will
include it but I literally forgot to
take them if I have an awesome photo
here it's a before and here is the after
do your eyebrows look over the top
without makeup on when I first took my
makeup off when they were freshly done I
do think they were very intense but that
was because they were just done so I
didn't know that they were going to fade
but without makeup on they look very
very natural it's crazy how natural they
look like whenever I mentioned to
someone I have eyebrows
fairly tattooed they're like yeah your
eyebrows tattooed on but yeah they were
so natural and nice and I don't think
they look over the top at all are you
happy with how they turned out but I'm
over the moon happy this was one of the
best choices I've ever made in my life I
was terrified to get my eyebrows done
feather tattooed because I think the
main point was that I was scared that
they were gonna look ridiculous or they
weren't going to suit me but they looked
amazing and I literally I'm so glad and
so thankful that I got them done because
it is honestly the best thing that's
ever happened to me I'm so happy with
them and on the first day that I'm done
I got so many ridiculously nice comments
about them which I didn't think I would
ever get about my eyebrows but best
choice I've ever made did you get them
done because you personally wanted them
done or did people comment on them
before you had them to a hundred and
times then I got them done because I
wanted them done I mean if people come
and tell them how bad they looked before
or something like that I could not give
two shits because I don't care what
people think I mean if you want to
change something about yourself go for
it if you want lip injections if you
want Botox if you want to no strong
anything just go for it I mean they are
not you at the end of the day it's what
you want it's your body you can do
whatever you want with it
and if people are going to criticize you
or judge you for doing that then they
are pathetic they obviously aren't happy
with themselves and they are most likely
jealous how long did it take you to fill
in your real eyebrows and how long does
it take now so as I said before it
literally took me about 20 minutes to
half an hour to do my eyebrows I wasn't
very thin I did
sorry I was very picky with how I filled
them in so that's why it took me so long
but now if I fill them in when I'm going
out or something it takes me about five
minutes it's amazing and the good thing
is majority at the time I don't have to
build them in yesterday is that keeps
happening and it keeps scaring me I
think very last question I help you guys
today about my eyebrows is after you've
had them tattooed on do you still need
to wax or thread your eyebrows or does
the hair not grow anymore
yes I still need to get the wax because
I do get laser hair removal or anything
like that I just got them tattooed on
sorry my eyebrow hairs are actually
growing back at the moment my eyebrows
grow so fast so I so need to get the wax
I still need to maintain them and stuff
like that but yeah so that is all I have
for today's video I really hope I
covered everything and answered the
questions that you guys wanted to know
if you have any other questions that I
did not answer or cover please leave
them in the comments below and I'll
definitely get back to you I hope you're
having an amazing day or night or
wherever you are in the world thank you
so much for watching stay pretty and
I'll see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
