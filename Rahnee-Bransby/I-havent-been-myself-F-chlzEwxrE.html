my channel so today I wanted to film a
question and answer video for you guys
because if any of you follow me on
instagram you distain I posted a Friday
and I'm pretty much a hundred times that
came out and told you the honest truth
that I wasn't being a hundred and ten
percent myself in my videos and I was
always holding back and to be completely
honest with you guys I'm not too sure
why I was always so scared and holding
back and he is because I'm very weird
person and I was very scared that
putting myself online I had to have like
this perfect image for people to like me
and to us a lot of you ornery Shaunie
recently came over to path to visit me
and she pretty much sat me down and she
said Ronnie you were so different in
person you were so crazy you're so
outgoing why are you not like that in
your videos Shaunie and I have been
friends for a very long time and so I
think she's always saying that I'm so
different in my view as compared to me
as I would be when I talked to her or as
in person
see I history being 100% myself and no
more holding back so today I wanted to
feel my question has to do for you guys
to be nice to get to know me a little
bit better so now that we have pushed
that out of the way I'm going to get on
into the questions that you guys have
asked me
so signing up with a pretty basic
question if any of you are new to my
channel or you don't know I'm 18 years
old so this is probably one of my most
asked questions last time I mentioned I
was a hundred and sixty nine centimeters
and I measured about five months ago so
I don't think I'm growing or I don't
think I've shrunk but if I have but
somewhere around 169 centimeters my
second base last question I'm obviously
Australian but I'm hop English and half
Maltese which if any of the are familiar
to most areas it is in Europe so
European and I'm like a quarter size as
well and I got done a French but I never
say French because that's my point
because it's literally like a dot so
English Maltese and thank you for your
question I love you too yes I do get
anxiety I actually stopped it from one
of the worst forms of social anxiety
when I was a lot younger that was when I
was around 15 I was 16 it was really
really bad
it goes to the point where it was so bad
that I didn't leave my house for a year
and a half unless it was to go to school
or to another family members house maybe
sometime in the future I'll do an
in-depth video about it all because I
don't really want to get into all of it
right now
but didn't thinking brain might anxiety
has come down a lot and I thank you so
much for that base to never be able to
go out in public because I would swear I
would shake and I have really bad
anxiety attacks but he's really helped
me overcome that I'm sorry I thank you
so much but I'm so grateful and happy
because when I go out in public I drink
out anxiety anymore I get it about 30 to
25 percent of the time and that's really
only in big big crowds or if I just
really feel uncomfortable but valium oh
it just story good I'm very lucky that
Braden came into my life around that
time where I was struggling with anxiety
really bad but the way I do that now is
just in fact we haven't panic attack out
in public I just tell myself everything
is going to be
hoping to feel like this I'm going to
hurt you you're gonna be fine
but if I do feel anxiety attack coming
on I will remove myself from the
situation for a few minutes I go to the
bathroom I'll get a glass of water and
just change a few deep breaths and just
comment so I find the best way to love
yourself and feel confident in yourself
is instead of picking out the bad things
that you hate about yourself I know a
lot of us do this we got the good things
like I have such tanks I wrote or I love
my teeth and then you start to feel so
much more confident in yourself and
another thing I find that a lot of young
girls and boys 3 is compare themselves
to others which i think is so wrong do
not compare yourself to anyone you were
born you for a reason you are going to
meet you your whole life and no one else
so why not love yourself and brace your
features because at the end of the day
you'll start with yourself and you're
gorgeous so you really have no reason to
not love yourself I have about 3 little
party tricks to quickly show you guys
number one I can dislocate my shoulder
when I was doing I actually just like
into this so now I can pop it in and out
of place which is really gross
ready
and it actually sounds disgusting as
well it sounds like waters like
squishing together pretty gross the
second party trick I can do is I can do
the Cadbury eyebrow ad dance if you guys
have seen the guys we add some years and
years ago you know when it's talking
about if I don't find a potty trip to
show you guys if you don't like tongues
or look away because it's pretty
disgusting but when I was little my
brother and I were bouncing on a
trampoline I don't know how this
happened don't even ask me because it's
such a weird concept but my brother and
I would add dancing but my brother and I
would bouncing on the trampoline and he
double balanced me and I like flew off
the trampoline and hit my tongue on a
glass table I didn't even know how that
happens that would already happen to me
so I don't have that little webbing
thing that you have under your tongue
now you're actually getting so
embarrassed to show you guys to use it
so embarrassing but really through it's
so freaking life
whenever I get asked this question I
don't know how to answer it because I
feel like everything and anything
inspires me like music movies places
nature the beach I can't really pinpoint
one specific thing that inspires me
that's a colada you know like for
example if I hear a certain song with a
sudden beat it'll give me inspiration to
film a video or give me a video idea and
just stuff like that and what in size my
fashion once again I feel like
everything and anything I leave in the
summer I pulled actually ish
that just clicked in my head I shouldn't
tell you guys what's up I live in a
surprise sate I live in a suburb that's
very similar it's very so much of our
Bay OMERS and the people in the suburb I
live in that really quirky and
themselves and really cool laid-back
people so I feel like I really get
inspired by them and I also have a lot
of really cool cafes and buildings in
the sub of that living sorry I got all
of that stuff really inspires me as well
I don't know what his size my fashion I
feel like everything and anything once
again I'm sorry fuzzy and asked that
properly for you I lost my virginity
when I was 16 years old to my boyfriend
Brayden when I was growing up I always
said that I wanted to lose my virginity
to someone that I was in a relationship
with or I had a connection with or was
dating because I always want to losing
your virginity as a special thing or
meaningful thing whereas some people
look at it like fun or pleasure or just
to muck around which is totally fine
each their own growing up I always stood
by when I said I wanted to do it when I
was 110 percent ready I didn't want to
be pressured into it or anything like
that and I certainly think that is very
very important if you are a virgin don't
be like you have to be pressured into
doing something you don't want to do it
when you're ready because at the end of
the day it comes down to you and only
you it is a very personal topic and
decision so I feel like you should a
hundred and ten percent to it when you
already and only already I was a hundred
times I'm ready when I lost it see ya at
the end of the day is no one else
your decision sorry do it when you're
comfortable and ready and it'll come
naturally I find this really comes down
to who you are as a person if you don't
care what people think about you or you
really care at all
I've only recently said it really
cares what people think of me people are
going to judge me no matter who you are
what you do but I really see that as a
form of jealousy or they're envious of
you that's how I look at it when it
comes to negative comments I just delete
the comment and blot the person that way
they have no way of interacting with you
or committing any further nasty comments
on your stuff but whenever I do see
haters I seriously do see it as a form
of jealousy or that they am nice to me
because why else would they hate on you
they don't know you they don't know you
personally I mean there will be days
where it gets to you depending on what
mood you are there are days where it
gets to me but just blocking and
deleting it is the best way you can go
about it because then it's not there for
you to keep looking at it's completely
gone and
when I first got into YouTube there were
a lot of videos that I filmed and put
time into editing and then wouldn't
upload and that was purely because I was
insecure and as many of you know it was
because I was so insecure about my teeth
and funny enough this is going to sound
so stupid but I used to try to talk I
don't know how to explain it I used to
try to talk by putting my tongue on my
bottom teeth so that when I would speak
you wouldn't be able to say them someone
like like that so yeah I've talked about
this but I slowly started to realize
that people are watching my videos for
me and that people watching my videos to
see makeup looks and stuff like that
people aren't going to be looking and
staring at my teeth so I started to get
a little bit more confident and I just
started to say who cares what people
think everyone is born with
imperfections and I'm not obviously my
team but another reason I started to get
really confident in my teeth it's
because I had a lot of friends that
actually really loves my teeth because I
was a crooked and wonky they kind of
brought like a unique feature to me but
I've always been insecure about them and
did everything to change it so now I
have the discipline so now they're
straightening up but yeah I actually
feel so confident in my teeth now
considering they're not perfectly
straight yet I just feel so much better
about their
I think the happiest I've ever been in
my life is right this moment right now
I'm the happiest I've ever been in my
life touchwood everything is just going
so amazing right now I'm genuinely sorry
happy and so content with life I've
literally never felt this happy in my
life
I have amazing friends I have an amazing
family I have all of you guys supporting
me I feel like I'm doing very very well
in life right now and I'm so proud of
myself which is a very width you can
just say but I genuinely am so proud of
myself
yeah I'm genuinely just sorry happy with
life right now I'm sorry happy to say my
my life it's taking me and my future is
taking me yeah I'm just so excited for
the future my number one goal before the
year ended was to hit 50,000 subscribers
