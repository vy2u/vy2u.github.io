so good a shadow
mm-hmm hey guys it's Ronnie and welcome
back to my channel I know it's been a
while I haven't been on YouTube for a
very long time but I'm finally back end
up filming videos sorry I thought I
would come back with my everyday makeup
look for you guys because a lot of
people actually ask me on Instagram how
I do my everyday makeup look so yeah I
thought I would show you guys in today's
video so if you guys would like to see
how I got this that makeup look and you
would like to see me talk about what's
been going on and how I've been doing
then a please keep on watching and I
really hope you guys enjoy and thanks
for having me back I'm very excited to
be back this feels so weird this is like
the first video that I filmed in about
two months and this is also the first
video that I've ever filmed without my
Invisalign as you guys know I've had
Invisalign for like two years and now I
feel comfortable enough to wear it now I
feel comfortable and I would not wear it
I'll feel me sorry a lot of people to
say take it out while you film and I was
like I would never do that because I
used to be starting Sakura but I don't
know I feel like a different person this
is me like getting all awkward and shy I
literally feel like I'm starting a new
job like I haven't done this and so long
as so much has changed I changed so much
since I last filmed so this is a very
different um let's just I'm just gonna
stop thinking about it and just start
off my everyday makeup look i use the
napoleon paris autopilot primer and i
also like to use the tarte brighter JS
highlighting moisturizer these two of
such a nice combo they just give a
really nice glow to the skin and make my
skin look super healthy and i've already
primed my skin today so skip that step
full foundation i've been using this
foundation for so long it is the Too
Faced Born This Way and I'm in the shade
of warm beige this by far is my favorite
foundation ever I've been using it for
the longest time and I literally will
never stop using it but I've been mixing
that with the Tod rainforest of the sea
foundation this is actually a water
foundation so it is really liquidy but
it just allows my skin to breathe
a little bit more and I really like how
these two look together so I just take a
beauty blender and I need a mirror
because we're not doing the no mirror
makeup challenge
so I know I've been gone off YouTube for
a very long time a lot of people
actually thought I quit YouTube but I
didn't I just needed a break
but I took too long of a break I was off
YouTube but honestly way too long and I
apologize for that but I'm back and I'm
better than ever I will be doing a
question that's a video next week I
should multitask at the moment I really
got at that I will be doing a question
and answer video next week and I think
in that I'm gonna explain why I was gone
not completely explained on a very
personal person when it comes to my
private life sorry I won't be giving you
guys like the whole or down but like a
little bit of what's been going on but
I'm very excited to be back and thank
you guys while having me back I'm so
glad and thankful that you guys stuck
around because that was sorry I'm fail
on my behalf we're not uploading and not
Kim you guys a reason why just literally
just like disappearing but I didn't
really like xscape from the internet I
was still on Instagram I've actually
been loving Instagram so much lately um
I've been out learning right all the
time
plus I think I came back at a really
good time as well because I have so many
amazing trips planned this year I'm
going to Coachella I'm going to London
I'm actually going to London in like two
weeks or I would be vlogging everything
I'm going to Europe I'm planning on
going to Europe for about six weeks with
two of my friends we've got a whole lot
of stuff going on so there will be so
many blogs and so many Instagram photos
I'm very excited for 2018 you know by
the way happy new year I don't know if I
said that yet already but having me I
think you guys had an amazing year I
really have to multitask because like
I'm really bad at that everything is
going so well in my life right now and
I'm just at a really good place fokin
Cielo I like to use the Naza radiant
creamy concealer in the shade custard
this has been one of my favourite
concealers for the for the other for the
other for the longest time ever I was
using the top shape tape and that is my
number one favorite concealer but I
actually ran out and it's so hard to
like get it shoots you know just because
shipping cost like my heart and soul so
I'm just gonna wait until I'm in Europe
or America or maybe even London
I hope they sell it there and then I'm
just gonna buh-bye because I would just
rather wait until I go overseas to get
it then like ship it yeah now I'm just
going to bake onto my eyes with my Laura
Mercier translucent loose powder it's
weird because like I don't really bank
under my eyes but I kind of do it it's
like I bake but I said at the same time
if that makes sense
yesterday was actually my 20th birthday
like I feel like 20 is such a random age
like it's sort of random but I had a
really nice day and thank you so much
what will be birthday wishes and the
birthday love I really appreciate it I
literally just spent the day at the
beach like what else would I be doing
now I'm just going to go ahead with my
Australis fresh and fullest in the
pressed powder in the shade darkest
Brown ever since I started YouTube I
messed up the name it is and I've been
using this since I was about 12 years
old and I say to bronze up my skin I've
been loving the Marc Jacobs Omega
bronzer in the shade tantastic this
gives such like a natural contour to the
face I don't like to contour every day
but I like to bronze up but it also
makes my face look contoured I don't
know if that made any sense whatsoever
I've been getting a lot of questions
lately about Shani and Michael and Lilly
and sky and all that Curry if I'm still
friends of them yes I am obviously still
friends with them I'm not sure if many
people realized that I actually live in
a different states or I'm in on the
other side of Australia I leave on the
western side and they leave on the
eastern side yep I was like no ate soggy
wait thanks yes I just haven't seen them
recently because of light Vinny is and
Christmas period um I spent a lot of
time at home
I also like to take that runs with down
my nose and just cuts on my nose a tiny
bit o for blush I've been loving pink
blushes which I usually never wear pink
blushes but this one is like one of my
favorites it is by nas and it is in the
shade
Isadora I literally could be butchering
that it looks like a bit of a
frightening color it's just like a very
toned blush and it's got like a no
bronzy on the turn to it
that's why I think I like it so much but
I actually have a funny story for you
guys that I want to share with you um
so obviously in Australia we have a
thing called Australia Day I'm sure
everyone would know what that is it's
pretty much like the fourth of July we
have a thing called the hottest 100 so
one of our radio stations countdown like
the hottest 100 songs over the and
everyone votes to see like what song
will become number one so number one
this year was actually Kendrick Lamar
humble is that what the song song anyway
there's a brother and sister duo recode
Angus &amp;amp; Julia starring if you guys have
never heard of them they are an
Australian doer and I'm just obsessed
with them you honestly have to look at
that stuff they're an incredible they
have a song that I say and it's one of
my favorite songs of all time and it go
over to number 3 sorry I was starting
anyway this story is been going on for
too long already
instead the name of the song is
shattered and I for some reason didn't
click it didn't click in my head that
the song was coded shatter I just didn't
know how to pronounce the word to the
owners sorry I look the summer school
chat to her I don't know what I said I
think I said shit chat you up or
something because it's kind of spelt
like cheat so I was like chat to up I
don't know where I got this vibe from
but I was like oh my god I'm so excited
for this song I hope it gets ready
number one anyway I was calling this
some chat to up and everyone was like um
it's called Chateau I was like that is
the most embarrassing thing of my life
I've never listened to a song that makes
me want to cry and that song makes me
want to cry and now it's your highlight
the face I'm taking the laura geller
illuminators
and I'm going to be using the shade at
gilded honey this is my favorite
highlighter whole time so I just quickly
went ahead and filled in my brows I
thought I would do that off camera
because everyone knows my brows
differently now moving on to the eyes
every single day I will put a warm brown
turn in my crease and that's pretty much
all I do for eye shadow I will literally
just use whatever bronzer or whatever a
shadow is out in front of me
and maybe onto mascara my favorite
mascara ever is the taut lights camera
lashes mascara and depending on my mood
for the day I almost sometimes either
just apply this to my top lashes or top
and bottom it really just depends on
like my hate favorite really in my eyes
are swollen and little I'll put the one
the top and the bottom lashes sucking
today I'm just going to put on the top
because they're not too swollen and
moving on to the last step before lips
this is like my signature thing this is
something that I always do it's like I
just love it and a lot of people always
ask me about it sorry I always drew a
gold inner corner highlight and the
thing that I use for that is the in
blood pigment in the shade one two one
well I do not want to come out to send
and to finish up with lips I will
alternate between at three lipsticks I
will either use the macro of its heady
of course or the NARS lipstick in the
shade at Verbeek this is more of like a
brownie nude and velvet Telly's more of
a pinky nude and then of course we have
to set the face oh so this is my
finished everyday makeup look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
really hope you guys are happy that I'm
back on YouTube
I'm sorry happy to be here it really
excites me and thanks for having me back
but thank you guys so much for watching
and I will see you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
