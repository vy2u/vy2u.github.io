my channel so today I bring you yet
another favorites video now I don't mean
I've melted June favorites I can't
remember but I'm pretty sure I Jennifer
June favorites and that was because I
didn't have any favorites in the month
of June and this month I don't have any
favorites either but what I do have is
good so I thought why don't film it oh
sorry I need to say this like every
other youtuber says holy we're in
August like what my like my head hurts
just thinking about that I'm closer to
my birthday next year than I am to this
year's birthday what the hell is sort we
say yeah I really need you guys enjoy
and let's jump right into it so my first
favorite thought I have to share with
you guys is something you'll notice as
soon as you click on this video right
and that is a new room it's a core piece
well it is in my background is this
record or vinyl play or whatever you
prefer to call it right here now I've
been sitting here for about 10 minutes
trying to pronounce the brand name it
shouldn't be that hard but for me it is
crazily closely closely I'm gonna go
with Crosley it could be crazy but I'm
gonna go with hoarsely sorry as soon as
I saw this in caught my eye and almost
like oh my god I need it because I don't
know if you guys can tell but I have a
huge obsession with brain everything
like
and anything to do with plants I'm
obsessed with my whole room is full of
plants so when I saw this I was like
that that is me a record player
like when I first saw this it was that
for I think 350 Australian dollars which
is quite extensive so I was like I
cannot spend that much on a record
player so I wasn't going to do it and
then I checked back about a month later
and it was down to it 190 and I was like
this is the universe telling me it's
meant to be sorry I put it in my car and
I was about to buy it and then it went
down to 120 and I was like the thing I
absolutely love about this start
mcplayer it is like a mini suitcase so
you just cool it and then open up and it
stuck and then it bobbles go right guys
can see and it's like a mini suitcase so
you can take on the GAR which is so cool
but the one thing I don't like about it
is the top of this 3k spot it liked
attaches so you can take it off put it
back on but it isn't attached very well
like it comes off very very easily when
I push it back and I have to lean it
against my wall because it doesn't stand
up on its own like my other record
player dude so that's probably the or
anything I don't like about it what you
have annoys me but nothing can be
perfect right but yeah that is my first
favorite for the month of July I'm just
sorry in my business it is so pretty
my next Tiger is a little bit more of a
personal one a little bit of a weird one
as well but you guys have been noticing
it like crazy and all my videos every
single video I get comments about it and
seriously makes me so happy so my next
favorite is my teeth now this is Soria
to talk about but as my funerary I do
have Invisalign I've had it for about
five or six months now I was supposed to
already be having it for six months but
I'm going to be having it for a bit over
a year now but I'm not complaining at
all it has made my teeth so incredibly
straight already and this is only the
first meet the liner I still have 21 so
very because I have 34 sets and I change
every two weeks if you didn't know it
but oh my god my teeth are looking
that's so incredibly straight and then
not even perfectly
right yeah I'm just getting so excited
about my teeth because I'm starting to
see progress in them and I guess so
excited to like smile and laugh now like
whenever I go out I'm like like laughing
with a full mouth open and like showing
my teeth up because I just feel so
comfortable in them right now I cannot
wait to see what they're going to look
like when they are completely straight
like if it looked this straight already
and they don't even halfway there yet I
can't even imagine what they're gonna
look like when I fully strike my
westcote I'm full of dancin I never
thought I would get so excited over tape
but like my whole life I'm sorry
insecure by my team and the fact that
they're actually changing out into
straight teeth makes me sorry freakin
excited and so much more comfortable in
my scope
I'm just like I've never been so happy
now my next favorite for the month of
July is a pair of earrings which I'm
wearing right now if you would have
saved my race at home not really racing
about a month and a bit a very high
price so that huge plentiful and I
shan't these in the hole now these are
just like cleanup bull's heads and oh my
god I'm so obsessed of them how many
times can I say
I think the number one thing that is so
cool about them is you can't really see
them or you can but they're not that
noticeable until like a light hits them
and then they just like work I just
think that's such a groovy piece of
jewelry I thought this for its uh Scully
recently in a sec two months I've just
been collecting during like that's nice
tomorrow because it came to my
realization that an outfit isn't
complete with a good piece of jewelry
sorry out of all the pieces of jewelry I
own it at least would have to be my
favorite pair of earrings which is a big
thing to say because I own some he has
of earrings but I just love them I
possess so cool and some different and
yes so my next favorite all your beauty
lovers out there is a bit for us so I
recently received a huge package from
colour-pop which I'm so thankful for
they were so kind to send that and they
sent us a of their colour-pop lippie
stix now these three I am here are my
three favorites of the whole bunch or I
haven't actually tried every color but
my three favorites out of the ones I
received now the thing I absolutely
adore about the caboose
and batteries will apply to the leaves
they don't spread everywhere and they're
not like messy you know when you
sometimes have like a cream finish or
satin finish it kind of smudges or like
gets on everything they start doing that
and they also come with an extreme and
matte finish which I was very scared for
because matte liquid lipsticks I don't
find that comfortable on my lips on my
Sarah good formula but the extreme matte
finish of these zones are so comfortable
for an extreme finish as well and they
are so comfortable they don't feel like
really heavy or like go flaky or
anything
so three shades I want to share with you
guys the first one is Aquarius now this
is my star sign so I feel like it's
meant to be but this reminds me a lot of
velvet teddy is kind of like a turn sock
of the velvet teddy but it reminds me a
lot of velvet teddy this has a cream
finish and I'm being wearing the hell
out of this lippy streak this month I
seriously wear it every single day every
time I go out at night I've just been
loving the color of it and just like the
look it gives it's very like natural but
it's not if that makes sense the next
one I have is a pillar salt and this is
an extreme matte finish now this looks
very similar to a query as far as is
more of a pink undertone and this is
more of a brand than Saturn but when you
apply it to your lips it is a lot more
Brown it is kind of like an actually
brown in a way it is quite of a dark
brown but it is very wearable at the
same time but I just think it's such a
light food of grocery brown because you
can dress them up or you can wear it
and the next one after shoe size is very
different for me I do not very near any
of these colors ever they are a little
bit out of my comfort zone it almost
looks like foundation on my lips when I
wear these colors but this is a shade
it's tbp it is just like a very yeah I
tried to mix it with a quiet and it's a
glossy finish I don't love the finish of
this one so much I'm starting to like
glossy finishes about the merriment and
especially have you guys seen I just say
this have you guys seen a Trevor Moran
with glossy lips oh my god he looks so
freakin beautiful with glossy lips like
I was watching you snapchats the other
day and I was like girl you freaking a
bum with glossy lips I wish I could rock
them that well but anyway this is like a
baby paint a very pale baby pink I don't
really like things under moonlight
wearing there but there's something
about this color which I freaking love
and also I'm wearing any pink liquid
lipstick on my lips today I feel like
I'm kind of getting into the pink shades
this is the revlon matte ultra hey she
liquid lipstick in the shade
okay I don't think this hasn't shaved I
think it's in the shade its reduction
I'm not too sure but holy crap I've
never felt a matte liquid lipstick with
this formula it is so nice on the lips
it is so light moisturizing in a way but
it doesn't feel like you have anything
on your lips especially for a matte
liquid lipstick it feels like there is
nothing on my lips I love the finish of
it I love the color and this has also
been another liquid lipstick that I have
mean and reaching for a lot more in my
collection the next thing I'm going to
show you guys is a t-shirt now I pick
this up the other day it is by the brand
v now I have a thing for stripes at the
moment I freaking love this dries I
don't know what it is about them but I
just love wearing them especially in top
sorry actually you guys also the shut on
my Instagram I went Sun photo of it on
heel but this is what it looks like
yeah it is just a brown navy and white
striped shirt I love the material of a
service stretching absolutely
comfortable and soft I feel like I could
sleep in this net but I absolutely love
but wearing this for the highways of
pair of jeans and then just noting out
on the slide I know I got something
about this show that I just freaking
love I feel like it goes really well
with my skin tone as well and it makes
me look really good I don't alright
everything that makes this shirt even
more special I was going shopping with
Brayden in the city once now I barely
shop in the city because I just don't
like the city there's so many people
around and I get really bad anxiety
attacks when I go into the city but
anyway we went to the city because he
really wanted to go shopping so I was
like why not
I've given birth so I went to the city
and I'm so my period that day and I was
having the worst cramps of my life I
felt like I was dying I was Anita saddle
battery I was just in pain the whole
time everyone's into a shop and use it's
like I want to buy these links to make
you feel better because I feel really
bad that you're in so much
so it was like we were on the show up
find something you want and don't get up
as soon as we walked into the show I saw
the show and I pulled my eye and I
looked your out of things but I came
back to the shadows like I need again
but you voted for me when I was a little
bits out which is my kind of view sorry
it kind of makes me love it that a
little bit more I have two more things
to share with you guys but this is the
last like item I have it is a pair of
sunglasses
now I'm gonna say this again you guys
know my obsession with sunglasses I have
the biggest collection now I picked up
this pass on the style mention which is
a pass on line store I don't like them
links below they sell the most
incredible sunglasses and like
accessories I also think I still have a
discount card which I'll link below for
you guys as well
I have to double check now the thing
about these Sony's is when I first got
them I was like I'm not sure if I'm
gonna like them because of the shape of
their but they also caught my eye using
is such a cool shape they kind of remind
me of speed you love funnies in a way
but I still freakin love them at the
same time but and you know they're just
such good quality but I just love these
money so much I love the shape I don't
really own any studies that I like this
really thin like cat eye shape so yeah I
know my last favorite that I want to
share with you guys to the V month of
July is an Australian bed now I'm sure
many of you have heard of them because I
had just started freaking amazing
I did hear this bad quite a while ago
but my obsession has only recently come
out in the past two months and I'm so
excited because I'm going to be seeing
them at listen out and sound found that
they're going to be attending so if you
go to any of those festivals you
definitely see them but they out the
band it's a Fiat now that music just
puts me in the best mood it reminds me
so much of a music festival I think
that's why I love it so much but they on
the band it's a Fiat now that music just
puts me in the best mood it reminds me
so much I'm a music festival I think
that's why I love it so much I to shop
true showmanship I have two songs that I
want to share with you guys the first
one is that make them wheels roll I'll
give you a little preview ready for the
chorus

the basses for me and then the next one
I'm gonna share with you guys I feel
like a lot of people who know this song
because it is quite a popular song it is
listen to solo it listen to flurries as

hits the spot real hard oh my god seeing
them live I'm so freaking excited you

part but festivals just make me start
happy and then maybe you guys at

going to go get sushi now because my
stomach is growling at me so I need to
feed this bad boy I would definitely
love to know what one of your favorites
were for the month of July maybe I can
try it out and it can be my favorite
