wear tonight because you're going to a
party
hey guys is Ronnie and welcome back to
my channel so i know i just uploaded a
video but i have to get this look up
because it is seriously amazing so today
i have filmed a kylie jenner golden
globes inspired makeup look when i saw
college and out the golden globes i
literally died and went to heaven her
makeup and just her dress and everything
looked freaking amazing so if you would
like to see my take on Kylie Jenner's
golden globe makeup look then please
keep watching and I really hope you
enjoy so starting with foundation I'm
using the fit me matte and poreless
foundation in which a through 20 now i
know i've been using this foundation in
a lot of tutorials lately but it is
seriously the best matte foundation i've
ever used and Kylie's was extremely mad
so this is the one I'm going for today
and now taking my L'Oreal True Match
concealer I'm just going to be applying
this on to my eyes down bridge my nose
on my forehead on my chin to highlight
and soup line that all out I'm just
taking a damp Beauty Blender
I'm not just taking my Alice Maggiore
contour kit I'm going to be taking the
banana shade and just setting under my
eyes and places i highlighted
and also said the rest of my face and
keep it extremely mad I'm taking the
benefit hello flawless pressed powder in
the shade twisted a
now moving right on to browse I'm taking
my Allison Jade brow bomb indicated deep
brunette and I'm just going to be
filling in my brows now Carly's brows
are quite dark and full and dodge and
she's so blessed to have such amazing
bras and my girls do not look anything
like her so I'm going to try my best to
make them look as close as possible but
I can't guarantee you anything similar
and i'm using the Allison Jade do a
eyebrow brush just to film it
sweet this is the brown strong I know
they're looking really intense and dark
but I'm just trying to make them look as
much as carly's as possible which I kind
of failed out because they don't really
look anything like her but we're just
gonna move on to the eyeshadow now so
for the eyeshadow I'm going to be using
the Maybelline the nudes palette and I'm
going to start off with your shade here
and going to blend that into the crease
as my transition shade
you
now i'm just taking this chocolate brown
shade and i'm going to blend that
through the crease and the outer V so
Carly haha awesome light wings a cat eye
effect so when I blender through the
crease I'm going to all recite flick it
up and start blending it up just to the
toe of my brow and this is going to give
us that winged out cat eye effect so
usually when you blend through your
crease you kind of bring it in a
circular motion and bring it like round
it into the crease to follow your
natural crease I'm just going to be
blending it straight across the crease
and we're up so it gives us that like
cut I wind artifact that Carly had we
perish it's going into the clean
blending brush just to blend that out so
that there are no harsh lines and it has
a really nice smoky transition now I'm
going to be taking the dark dark brown
in your palette and I'm just going to be
pretty much blending that over the outer
V and the crease again where we blend
with the light brown just to really
darken up the look and intensify it a
lot more
I'm just going to be taking the gold
shade in the palette and just packing
out everything lid so the inner half and
the middle of the lid way we have no I
shudder yet and now I'm just going back
in with your darkest brown in the
appellant and I'm just going to be
applying this along my lower lashline
and blending it out I'm just going to be
taking the black in the palette and just
applying that to the op lash line on the
outer V and smoking it out a little I'm
not going to bring this all the way in
or make it through intense she just had
quite a bit of depth on her lash line
I'm going in with the Rimmel London rich
brown eyeliner and just applying this
along my lower lash line
they didn't look like Carly had any fake
eyelashes on whatsoever if she did it
would have been individual lashes but
she definitely didn't have any false
like large bands on so I'm just going to
be taking the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara and just pumping up
my lashes I'm going to be applying a lot
and a lot of coats of these to my top
lashes and just one coats my bottom lash
hey I just look back on some of the
footage and the camera wasn't picking
out my eye makeups be as dark as it
actually was a dark and intense as the
actually worked in person so it just
softens it up a bit and now in person
it's like black so hopefully you guys
can see it now my camera is mocking up
and isn't thinking anything off which is
really strange now I'm just going to
lightly contour my cheekbones my
forehead and my nose with uhaul a
benefit bronzer now Kylie's contour
wasn't extreme and intense in this
makeup look where she usually has it
quite intense contour it was more on the
natural side
also I can turn my jawline I totally
forgot to mention
now moving on to blush Holly had these
gorgeous rosy cheeks sign taking at the
Milani baked blush in the shade 03
barrier more just a grody pink blush
with a little bit of type of reflexes in
it it does have a tiny bit of glitter in
and I think that is perfect because
Kylie had better like glittery reflexes
on her cheeks so I'm just going to be
applying this onto the apples of my
cheeks and blending it up to the contour
now Carly happy tiniest tiniest bit of
highlight on for this makeup look so I'm
taking my Chi Chi wall of shimmer bronze
shimmer brick and I'm just going to be
mixing these two shades here together
i'm not going to be mixing them all and
i'm just going to be seriously applying
the tiny bit to the high points of my
cheekbones Mike you perspire up my nose
and my forehead and half of you last
step which are the famous Kylie Jenner
lives I do believe it's already quite
big sorry i'm not going to overdraw mine
at all because i do look kind of crazy
with overdrawn lips so I'm sorry or by
lining them and filling them in with the
teaching with liner in the shade is
readily new
I think I accidentally grabbed the wrong
color lip liner because i have 2 news
once totally nude and once Callan to go
and tell us to go evening or brownie was
which color looks more on the brownie
side so if you do have those two she lip
liners totally go for palin to go
because that is more of a brownie nude
which actually grabs totally nude which
is more of a pinky nude now paddles lips
were Pike losses so I'm taking the
Rimmel London purbachal its lip lacquer
in the shade of skinny dipping and this
is a brownie nude and just applying this
on top of the lip liner
and our 1c lips are done this is the
completed makeup so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and I hope it
was quite an activity one that you like
the Golden Globes if you enjoyed this
video and would like to see more
celebrity inspired makeup looks then
