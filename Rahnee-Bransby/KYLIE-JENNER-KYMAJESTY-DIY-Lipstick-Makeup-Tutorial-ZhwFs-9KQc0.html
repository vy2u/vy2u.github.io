and welcome back to my channel today I
have a super exciting video because it
is a makeup tutorial and iti Y in one so
as most of you probably know Kylie
Jenner has dropped any lip color which
is kind Majesty it is a black metal
liquid lipstick and it's kind of got
like blue reflexes in it so today I
thought I would film a do-it-yourself
kind Majesty liquid lipstick I know
Kylie Jenner's liquid lipsticks are
really hard to get your hands on
personally I don't own any because I
can't be bothered getting up at 3 a.m.
Australian stead of times we just get my
hands in some liquid lipsticks so today
I thought this is perfect for any of you
guys that want this color or can't get
your hands on this color I've been with
do it yourself so today I'm going to be
recreating at this makeup tutorial here
that Kylie Jenner is wearing this video
is also inspired by the amazing the hues
tutorials here on YouTube I thought I'd
quickly clarify that before I get any
comments being like oh my god I do copy
nikkietutorials idea this is inspired by
her so I thought instead of just doing
the DIY liquid lipstick I would do the
makeup look that Kylie Jenner is
learning in this video when she first
released a preview of kind Majesty so
yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial what you pee so I'm gonna see
the make up side of it and you just want
to see the gri liquid lipstick I leave a
link here so you can just click on the
time and it will take you to you when I
do the liquid lipstick but other than
that I love this makeup tutorial
especially the liquid lipstick so yeah I
hope you enjoy it
and let's jump into it starting with the
base I've already primed with the Estee
Lauder illuminating perfecting primer
just to give my face that healthy glory
and a flow foundation I'm using the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation in the
shade natural beige I'm applying this to
my skin with my finger and then blending
that unit with a damp Beauty Blender oh
sorry I apologize if my voice in the
voiceovers sounds a bit like nasally or
blocked up is because I
even sick of the moment ever really
phlegm you throat it's not cute but I
just gotta work
once the Foundation's on and it is the
amount of coverage that I'm happy with
I'm Ruby on students illa so I'm just
going to speak in sterling under my eyes
and down bridge of my nose with a light
concealer this is the Maybelline
concealer in the shade as light or pale
one of the true so I'm just doing this
on my eyes and that bridge binaries just
to give the face a highlighted effect
and make me look a little bit more awake
and refreshed ready for the day and then
of course going ahead and studying the
places I highlighted with my Allison J
to consult palette so I'm just taking
the banana shade on a real techniques
clinto brush I know this is a contour
brush but it is seriously the best for
setting under eyes with you really
shouldn't be and of course you guys know
the drill we've got to set the rest of
the face so I'm taking my Australis
fresh and flawless in the shade darkest
Brown and just setting the rest of my
face I will never not use this product
it is the best like Holy Grail now going
to lightly contour with the hoola
benefit from Zhao I do believe that
Kylie did have a slight contour in this
photo but I always go over the top with
my contour so going to lightly contour
my cheekbones my temples my jawline and
my nose
I'm now taking the makeup geek blush
English and infatuation this is kind of
like a brawny peachy kind of shade I
don't really know how to explain it but
it is very similar to the shade that
Kylie had on her cheeks in the photo oh
my god I forgot to breathe just then see
I'm just applying this to my cheeks and
I actually received this in the mail
this morning when I feel and says and I
have fallen head over heels in love with
it I think it's such a beautiful color
nafla brows I'm taking the benefit me
goof proof brow pencil also and all the
products I received in the mail this
morning I love this brow pen so it is so
like how do you clean it I don't know it
it's just amazing it kind of has like a
powder formula in a way yeah so I'm just
going ahead and filling my brows with
that and then just setting my brows in
place with the benefit 3d brow turns I
think this is another new product you
benefit but it is amazing
who can never go wrong with brow
products
so colleagues eyes are very very simple
and very natural so I'm taking these
still our eyes on the window palette in
which shade lines I think and I'm just
taking this warm brown shade and I'm
simply just blending this into the
crease packing that all over the lid and
also blending that along the lower lash
lines that's pretty much all you do for
the eye shadow except a little step
after we have very simple very easy and
very natural
so you did look like Kylie had a smoking
Lynas so I'm just going to be taking
this dark brown shade and just applying
that to my top lash line and I'm doing
this with just like a small detailer
brush and then I'm just going to be
blending that out to give it that kind
of smoky effect I'm sorry you can
probably hear the vacuum in the
background right now
then I just went ahead and cry some
eyelashes with a few cuts in the star
and applied some falsies I'll leave the
ones I use a listed below now I'm taking
this white shade which I don't know why
in the pan it looks yellow but I'm
taking this matte white shade and just
applying that on my inner corners to
highlights
now I'm going in with the aura you Jimmy
highlighter this is like a golden turn
to highlighter it is one of my favorites
in soy beautiful so I'm just applying
that to the high points of my face and I
don't think Kylie had any intense my
line in the photo but I decided why not
do we go to do girlfriend
yay now time for the fun stuff sorry I'm
using the jeffree star weirdo liquid
lipstick this is just a map-like
liquid lipstick now I know there's a lot
of controversy going on which I could
start at the moment I don't really like
him as a person but I do appreciate his
products and I do like his products so
if I have them I'm going to use them
because obviously I want to get my
money's worth if you don't believe in
buying Jeffrey Starr's products then an
alternative for this would be the Ophir
liquid lipstick exactly the same same
formula everything but this is the only
black liquid lipstick I have I'm not
going to get into the whole Jeffrey
staffing at the moment because I just
can't be bothered with it and it doesn't
really faze me that much I just don't
like him as a person that much but if
you do want to know what's going on I'm
sure you can just google it or look it
up on YouTube or something like that
but by all means I do love his products
and I'm still going to keep using them
because I do think they're great I just
don't really live but I just don't
really like the name behind the products
and I'll go how to make this look like
the high majesty liquid lipstick I'm
taking the makeup geek foiled eyeshadow
in the shade
Wendy me I really don't think I'm
pronouncing that right I think I'm
butchering the hell out of that and
after the black liquid lipstick house
dried I'm mixing at this word eyeshadow
with a bit of mac fix+ and then I'm just
brushing out onto my lips like I would
with any gloss or anything like that
but I absolutely love how this looks I
think it looks a lot like hi majesty if
not exactly the same and it's just a
faster not faster it's just probably an
easier and cheaper way to go about it
but I just obsessed with this color I
think it turned out perfectly and yeah
that is the finished look so this is the
finished look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and the liquid
lipstick or the makeup look how to that
and anyway if you didn't please don't
forget to give a massive thumbs up and
be sure to share it with your friends

you're having an amazing day and stay
pretty and I'll see you very soon
