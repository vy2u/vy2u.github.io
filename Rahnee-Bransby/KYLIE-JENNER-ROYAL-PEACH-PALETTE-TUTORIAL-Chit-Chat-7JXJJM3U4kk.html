back to my channel so today I wanted to
sit down with real men to check get
ready with me
so I do really want to do a PT makeup
look today because I've been loving I
really hope you guys can't hear these so
I really want to do a peachy eye makeup
look today because I've been wearing
teacher choice a lot lately and I
absolutely love it I think it is so
pretty and so fresh so I'm going to be
using my Kylie cosmetics peach color for
that also I want this figure 3 super
chilled out so if I don't mention any of
the products that I'm using it they
would be listed below I'm just going to
quickly go ahead with the Smashbox photo
finish primer water and apply my face I
just ate that maybe on to foundation I'm
going to using the SI glitter double
wear foundation today I'm not the
biggest fan of this foundation I mean it
is nice but I don't know there's just
something weird about it but I'm going
to give it another word stop making
noise I need to start using different
products because I literally use the
same product in all my videos so I want
to quickly start out by asking you guys
how you're going I never really asked
you guys how you're going or how your
day is going I'd love to know how you're
doing I've been freaking amazing lately
I've never been so happy and content
with life everything is just paid in the
direction I want it Terry and everything
into something so positive and so great
in my life right now
I have been doing a lot more traveling
recently actually I just got back from
Brisbane and the Gold Coast about two
weeks ago because I went over there for
a benefit event and then I also did a
meet-up with princess Polly and benefits
in the Gold Coast with SHINee and
Michael it had an amazing outcome I
think we had over a thousand people turn
up and that is honestly so crazy it was
a very long day and very tiring but it
was I was going to go work but it was so
much fun and then after the me that were
happy get on a plane and fly home so I
was literally dead I was so tired now
I'm just going to conceal my under eyes
sorry I must really need this time next
week I'm going to Sydney for a launch
party and an event with L'Oreal I can't
wait to just get really super glam up
because I barely ever get glammed up I
just had power over glam and then after
that I am going to Brisbane to see Sean
but I'm thinking I really really really
want to move to Brisbane or to me I'll
probably move to Brooklyn because Sydney
is a bit hectic for me I feel like it's
so busy there and Brisbane reminds me so
much of Perth it's just a tiny bit
busier so I probably moved to Brisbane
but I just got to wait for braiding to
finish uni degree and see of course if
she wants to move over that I think
she's slowly starting so once we when I
first told him about it he was super
funny about it but now I think he's
slowly wanting to but yeah I would love
smooth over there I feel like there's so
many events and stuff that I understand
because I am perfect I feel like it is a
lot harder for me to attend event and go
to them and stuff so hopefully we will
make the big move maybe next year
sometime I'm just going to go ahead and
set my face with my Australis fresh and
polish pressed powder
sorry Coachella is happening right now
well we can want to finish but holy crap
I said in that video love fear that I
would go to Coachella this year and I
just didn't attend to see I don't know
why I think it is a lot of planning and
organizing and I feel like it just crept
up
sorry fastest year so next year I am
push all going Shani Michael and I
really want to grow together because
that would be so much fun
and going to simply take my solar light
runs up
come to my face I've also had a heck of
a lot of you guys that are from
Australia asked me if I'm attending
splendor in the grass appear and
drumroll the answer is yes I'm going to
climb in the grass Mencia but I'm very
excited to attend splendor because I've
never been before and everyone raves
about it so it's like whole new crap I'm
so excited and I have so many of you
guys asked me if I'm going but if you're
going keep an eye out for me because I
would love to meet you guys
I just posted my everyday makeup look
last night and the response I'm getting
on that video is amazing this kind of
made me miss making videos because I
stopped doing them for a very long time
sorry I'm happy to be getting back into
them but you guys are so sweet but I
honestly I will never understand what I
did to deserve such great viewers like
you guys are so so nice it melts my
heart so now I'm just going to go ahead
and quanta my nose I really really want
to start traveling this year it's just
so hard because I want to travel with
Braden but I really up this nose
contour Oh what my goodness oh my god
you know what I just realized the brush
I was using to contour my nose had black
 eyeshadow on it Anthony likewise
icon to another interview today oh my
god I had like a black line can you see
that maybe I do blush I'm going to take
the Too Faced Papa joint peach blush I
never used this before but it is a
really pretty like peachy coral blush so
I'm going to see how stories
oh this is so pretty there's so many
thoughts that have sitting in my drawers
I haven't try it and then I try them and
oh my god this is amazing I really need
to feel like a cool piece of first
impression
Wow oh did you guys see that that did
not want to come out too soon I thought
like doesn't slow motion movie MC
highlighter I'm going to using the
Jeopardy our skin for us any shade peach
got it now I just want to insane
Geoffrey
it is sort unnecessary how big depends
of the skin from lip like honestly this
is going to last me until I'm about nine
years old and then probably another 90
years on top of that base so it's like
the size of my hands about lately I've
been learning um PhD highlights for some
reason and the news I know what at the
do it mind starts to get popular because
obviously group people comments on my
videos but I know when my start to grow
I like the turning pages link which is
so many people comment and say why does
 G highlight your nose
it makes your nose look twice as big and
like go let me do my bangs I honestly
would just never understand the reason
why people criticize other people's
makeup like if you don't like it because
you're not wearing it it's not your face
until you spritz my face with a little
bit of six plus and then jump off camera
I'm filling my brows and I'll be right
back
this route on the left doesn't even want
to be friends with this brass today when
usually that sisters should say it
depend one of these friends with her not
really on to the eyes a lot of people
actually asked me to film a tutorial
using the color cosmetics peach palette
after a cure it's in my new video and I
was like perfect timing I've always
wanted to film a video with this palette
sorry I'm going to be doing a PT at
support it so I'm going to do something
really super fun and teaching Gloria I'm
going to use like most of the pink trays
so starting off with the shaky or called
sandy I'm going to this as my transition
shade so I'm going to go ahead and ask
the bigger question
drop the bombshell have you guys watched
13 reasons why I almost dropped
everything to since I got so excited so
I started watching it last week I
haven't actually watched it as fast as I
would like to I've been a little bit
busy sorry I've been having to watch it
just before I go to bed
and when I watched something past 6
o'clock at night I fall asleep and it's
not just the show it is boring on the
movie is boring I physically can't stay
awake when I'm watching something at
nighttime like you can't even take me to
the friggin movies or a cinema to watch
a movie because I'll fall asleep
mayberry when I watch a movie a few
months ago maybe like sometime last year
actually cover what movie it was it was
like the most intense movie ever and I
 fell asleep I was a little show
you in the cinema with like 100 people
around me and I fell asleep free top
that especially in a public place and
especially out of movies that you're
paying to go watch I just so mad at
myself I can't believe I've actually
done that but honestly I try to do like
movie nights with braids in like really
cute movie nights eat lots of food and
stuff try two minutes into the movie
after I'd like eaten all my food
I totally friends like we're not doing
reenact anymore you can't watch past the
20 minute mark I'm like I'm sorry I'm
really trying so now I'm just going in
with the shade on the end called
cinnamon and I'm going to blend this in
my a decree also the other thing I think
is so cool about uncertain where you can
play is the main Johanna is from Perth
and I think that is so awesome
also a huge change in public business
around
I just thought of it I don't know how I
thought of this actually thinking about
what I was talking about before I know
when one of my viewers like trending
because um all random people comedies
but sort of many people come in and say
why do you have a black dot on your nose
or like hun idea playing on your nose I
have a dent in the bottom oh I know so
if you ever look at my nose and you go
why does she have black on a nose
it's not actually black it's
actually then I like some days it's
darker than others which a sign so weird
but even my mum would it was like what's
on your nose I was like mum
he's been looking at my face every day
over the past 19 years I'm sure you know
what's on my nose
I've lost a lot today I just look in
here thinking like numerals earth now
I'm just going to throw in with the
shade here called peachy and I'm going
to apply this all over the lid
now I'm just going to take the shake
here cold sorbet and I'm going to apply
that in the center on my lid just to pad
out or give my eyes up a little bit more
now I'm just going to be taking the
shade sadly and cinnamon and I'm going
to start blending that along my lower
lash line just on the out of the area
because then I'm going to screw it in
with peachy and I'm going to learn that
on the inner corners
now I'm just going to quickly take my
place sweet peach Glory pellet and take
the highlighting shade in the palette
and I'm also going to take me Jeffrey
Scott Jeffrey's car Jeffrey stop skin
frost in peach butter and apply these to
my inner corners so now I'm just going
to quickly go ahead and jump off camera
and apply the Alois 117 lat
by the way these are my favorite blushes
ever from the drugstore never tried this
brand blushes especially leaves on they
ass or denies you have to get them it's
like fluffy and fluttery and I love them
so now that be lashes and the car is
done this corners kind of sitting a bit
funny but I can't really pretty so
hopefully it doesn't flake off now the
very last step is Lee I'm going to using
the Too Faced sweet peach creamy peach
boy lip gloss this one is in the shade
at Papa don't teach and this one is in
the shade of peach fuzz so I think I'm
going to do kind of like an ombre oh we
shoot these actually these actually make
me so happy because they smell that good
these are the best smelling things I've
ever smelt in my whole life like it's
actually ridiculous
I feel like these are kind of burning my
lips a little bit I don't know why so
this is the completed makeup look I know
a lot of you guys have asked for a
full-blown makeup look and I really ever
do for them because I don't think I put
it very well but it's probably as talk
them as I get I really really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and if you do
that please don't forget to give me a
master comes up and subscribe if you
need because we are almost at 100k that

much fun of filming this colored makeup

day and I'll switch you all very soon
