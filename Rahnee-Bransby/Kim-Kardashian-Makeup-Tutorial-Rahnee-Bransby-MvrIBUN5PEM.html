channel thank you so much for watching
so today I am back with another
celebrity inspired makeup look now I've
been wanting to do a Kardashian or Jenna
inspired makeup look for so long now and
I never knew who to do first I came
actually posted this photo and we could
go on Instagram and I fell in love with
the makeup look especially the bright
orange red lips I was like yes I
definitely need to film that you guys
would like to see how to recreate this
link up look then please keep watching
and let's try and turn into it also just
might not think i want to quickly say i
just watched some of the footage back on
my computer and i have so much hair
spray in my hair because before I was
trying to like wear my hair slicked bag
and it just wasn't working for me so I
have so much hair spray my hair right
now that it's creating like all these
little white dot so I don't know if any
of you guys another half hour before so
you do see that in the video please just
ignore it because it was really really
bugging me and I wouldn't think the
camera would pick it up right let's go
sorry I've already gone ahead and
Prime's my skin where the benefits
professional an hour for foundation I'm
using the fit me matte and poreless
foundation in the shade to can satiate
beige and I'm just going to be racking
this over my skin with a Beauty Blender
now Kim's look was extremely mad for
this makeup look so this foundation is
going to be perfect
and now i'm taking true concealers to
conceal and highlight so i'm starting
out with the instant age rewind in the
shade light and i'm just applying this
under my eyes down my nose on my chin on
my Cupid's bow on my forehead and just
below my cheekbones just to give us a
really highlighted effect because the
Kardashians are really known for that
really highlight intense highlight and
then I'm going over with the maybelline
fitme concealer in the shade light just
to line everything up and really give us
that intense highlight and i'm going to
be blending everything out with the tip
of a beauty blender
now taking my match perfection
translucent powder i am going to be
baking now the Kardashians are also
extremely well known for baking so I'm
just applying this in the places i
highlighted and then I'm going to let
that sit for a while and come back and
just brush it all off
and now taking my AC on to a contour kit
I'm going to be taking the lightest
shade in this palette and I'm just going
to be packing this over where I
highlighted and concealed just to really
intensify the highlight because Kim's
highlight in this photo was extreme I
just said hello so much now taking the
browsing palettes by benefit I'm just
going to be taking the west and filling
in my eyebrows now Kim and I have
extremely different eyebrows her has are
a lot more thinner and elongated sorry I
just tried to make mine a lot more
thinner than what they usually are and
try to make them a little bit longer at
retail this was extremely hard because
I'm very picky with my eyebrows but they
turned out okay now taking my NARS
casino bronzer I'm just going to be
contouring now Kim always has an
extremely strong at contour so I made
sure that i did my contour quite strong
so I'm starting off by contouring my
cheekbones and making it quite harsh
and now I'm going ahead and contouring
my jawline and then I'm going to be
contouring my temples my forehead and of
course I'm going to be contouring my
nose because Kim has a really slim nose
and mine is huge so we have to contour
that down and make it look a little bit
more smaller now we're back to baking
sounds like a like cooking show so I'm
just going to be baking under my
cheekbones and just letting that sit for
a while and brushing it off now this is
just going to enhance our chief burns a
little bit more and make them pop time
for the eyes I'm taking this covergirl
quad in the shade go for gold now I'm
starting out by taking a shade one and
just packing this over my lid I couldn't
really see what Kim had on her I so I'm
just gonna wing it and see what we come
up with and now i'm taking it shake true
and just working this into the crease
and this is just going to give our
crease a little bit more depth and now
i'm just going back over with shade one
and packing out who the lid because it
kind of came off while we were blending
and now taking my cheat sheet black
liquid eyeliner pen i'm just going to be
creating a simple line on my top lash
line we're keeping it really simple and
easy we're not going to be creating any
wing or anything and just lining my top
lash line
now taking my favorite mascara at the
moment this is benefits roller lash I
absolutely love this mascara I'm just
going to be putting a coat on the top of
my lashes and prepping them for my
falsies and now taking my car 0 43 black
falsies and just applying these up
through my lashes now i really regret
using these lashes because i thought in
the packet they look really wispy but
when they were on they do look as wispy
as they were in the packet and kim's
lashes we're extremely wispy sorry i
recommend using a different pair of
lashes for this but one so on i couldn't
really do anything about it we just have
to bear with it
so you just have in this happens so I
got a scar on my I know I'm just gonna
let that sit there and dry until I take
it off so just taking my roller lash
again and i'm just going to be pumping
out my lower lashes I'm going to be
applying a lot of mascara to my lower
lashes to make them look extremely long
because Kim's lower lashes are to die
ball they are so long so you were
packing on a lot of mascara and I just
going ahead and lining the lower lash
line with a nude eyeliner and now to
give us that really bronze bombshell
look that Kim is rocking I'm going to be
taking my Rimmel London blush in the
case and just apply this to my sheets
and blending it
now I can't tell if Kim was wearing any
highlights or anything so I'm just going
to be applying the smallest amount of
this chichi bronze wall of shimmer
highlighter and yeah and just really
lightly dusting this on to the high
points of my face cosmic love gave you
shingle and I'll review on to the very
last step I'm going to be taking this
Chi to stay online are in the shade its
status and I'm just going to be
outlining my lips and following up with
the teaching of matte lipstick in the
shade at status as well and applying
this to my lives now I found this
lipstick was more on the orange side
where Kim's lips were more of a ready
orange so I followed over the top with a
creamy matte liquid lipstick by TT in
the shade lady in red and this is also
going to give us a little bit of a
glossy finish which Kim did have on her
lips so yeah and then once the lifts are
done that is the completed makeup look
so this is the complete with makeup look
I love how it turns out so if you guys
also you enjoyed it please give this
video a massive thumbs up because it
means the world to me also leave a
comment below which celebrity I should
get inspired by and film a tutorial on
next I hope you guys are having an
amazing day or night or wherever you are
in the world I don't think I have
anything else to say other than thank
