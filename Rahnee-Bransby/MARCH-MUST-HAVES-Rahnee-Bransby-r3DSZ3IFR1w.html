it's Ronnie and welcome back to my
channel so today I have filmed a
favorites video but as you can tell from
the title I haven't named March
favorites I names at March must have
because instead of mania to favorites
every single month I'm going to try
anything where I use a word that starts
with the same letter of that month if
that makes sense I feel like spicing it
up a little bit instead of calling it
like a March favorites where it's every
year to becauseit March favorites I feel
like adding a little bit of twist so
yeah today I'm doing a March favourites
video I decided to do it a little bit
different because my favorites videos
grow for so long I'm sitting there
editing and I'm like my voice was
getting so annoyed because I sit there
and talk for like 15 minutes so I
decided to make it a little bit shorter
and a little bit different so I believe
you guys enjoy the way this video has
been filmed it was so much more fun to
film at then sit down and talk because
I'm no I like being creative sometimes
so if you do enjoy it please don't
forget to keep this video at massive
thumbs up because the things allows me
I'm going to stop rambling on now and I
really hope you enjoyed
you
you
so thank you so much for watching my
March must-haves please leave me a
comment on something that was your
favorite for the month of March because
I would love to try it out I hope you
all having an amazing day as I always
say stay pretty and I'll see very soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
