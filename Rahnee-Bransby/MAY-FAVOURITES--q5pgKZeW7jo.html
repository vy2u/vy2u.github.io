hour just staring out the window oh jeez
hey guys it's Ronnie and welcome back to
my channel so today I thought I would
sit down a film and may favorites for
you guys because I haven't done a
favorites video Jennifer very moderate
woman so today I thought I'd sit down
and show you guys my favorite things of
the month Ivan's on one of these videos
in a while and I don't have that many
things true guys but what I do have is
amazing so if you like to see some of my
favorite items from the month of june
per month may or june so if you'd like
to see some of my favorite items for the
month of me then please keep on watching
and the ledge jump into it i'm going to
start off with my favorite piece of
Jerusalem what the May I'm sure every
man and the dog has to move out this
pencil draw because I just want the hell
out of it it is this true die for trick
right here I got this from a website
called dolls killed calm I'll leave that
blue if you guys wanna check it out I go
this week surgery to wear to GTM and
this seriously is the best piece of
jewelry I've ever orange I know the
whole coin at stroke a trend has been
around reliable but this is by far the
nicest Cointreau fire I've ever seen
ever I really like the fact that it has
all these amazing colorful gems all over
it I think that makes it more
eye-catching in like outstanding because
I've never seen one of these that is
actually colorful I totally think this
trigger pulls every outfit see of that I
literally love wearing it and I wear
with anything and anything sometimes I
have to tell myself to stop buying it
because I work too much but personally I
think it is one of the most beautiful
pieces of jewelry I have ever seen in my
life it has these um black bits of rope
as a backward sheet around your back my
only concern is when I took it off that
night of GTM so to have shower and Gary
permanent stop it seriously look like
someone had like grad me and charged me
so hard that my skinhead bruise because
the black lining inside I've marked my
skin but it comes off really easily
just ease so so that was my only concern
when I don't know if it's because of the
lining inside or because of my skin type
but other than that this is by far my
favorite piece of jewelry in the world
my next favorite is the chichi fabulous
and flawless foundation I'm in the shade
a medium olive I absolutely adore this
foundation I've only recently tried it
I've had in my collection for about a
year now I think was because I was
scared it wasn't going to be my skin
color but now that I tried it matches my
skin tone and perfect something which is
so annoying I literally love this
foundation it is cruelty free so it is
tested on friends and family which I
love as well my earning downside about
this foundation is it definitely doesn't
go by a little goes a long way you have
to use quite a lot to get the coverage
you want I just find that a little bit
doesn't really cover a big service if
that makes sense so yeah but other than
that this has been absolutely amazing
and it is definitely one of my favorite
foundation I only have to make up
products that I want to share with you
that'd be my favorite this month the
next one is a matte lipstick in the
shade and film your I can never say this
every time I say it I butcher it and
people correct me in the comments but i
think it's film your i'm not sure like
this is one of matt's satin finish
lipsticks it is very light brown it is
always black in a way it has a purple
and red undertone and I absolutely love
it lately I've been stepping away from
the dark colors I haven't really been
going any dark colors like any blacks or
bronze or reds or stuff like that which
I usually absolutely love dark colors I
don't know why I just think it's when I
haven't been lying it is so hard to wear
lipstick because it is plastic the
lipstick transfers onto my invisalign
really easily so that's why I kind of
just being like distant from tom
fuller's lately but last week I tried
this on and I fell in love with it I
actually had never wanted before and now
I've been wearing the hell out of it I
had to tell myself not to wear to the
day but I really wanted to but yet this
is one of the best dog bones I've ever
seen if you're looking for a brilliant
really intensely dark brown I would
definitely pick this up my next one is a
little bit different but it is a phone
case can we just take a moment to
appreciate the gold goodness of this
phone case I got this phone case from
sports girl for twelve dollars literally
twelve dollars that is amazing so I saw
this phone case and I couldn't resist I
had to buy it because it is literally me
in a phone case oh my god didn't even
notice the back of my truck I wanted to
make an appearance it has tiny pieces of
gold foil and gold stars in it and i
literally just think it's the prettiest
thing I've ever seen I've actually been
on the look to find a really pretty
phone case for a while because I feel
like my foreign deserves to look pretty
i always have the ugliest phone cases
and they always get ruined or destroyed
or look ugly so i really wanted to get
one that was secure for my phone but
also really free at the same time yeah i
feel like if i was supposed to be for in
case i would be the same case my next
favorite is a clothing item it is this
faux fur coat yes don't worry is fake
fur I don't believe in real fur I would
never purchase real fur in my life I
don't see the point of spending ten
thousand dollars on a real fur coat
while having an animal in the process
when you can buy a fake photo which
looks exactly the same is just a soft
and I animals get her and it's so much
cheaper so I absolutely love love love
the color but it is admired baby pasture
with blue this is sorry incredibly soft
I never felt a phone poke through
stopped in my life every time I where I
get so many compliments on how soft it
is and because it is winter at the
moment everyone that comes up to me
tries to cuddle me out my cuddly little
better but this is from zara a few
seasons ago so i drank these will be in
stock anymore I've never owned something
like this or this color before so I love
the color thing that is to die for I
think that's my favorite thing about it
it is so warm and cozy and yet it is
just one of my favorite pieces of
clothing at the moment speaking of
fashion my last item to show you guys
it's a pair of boots these are from
beth's speaking of beth's I shot with
them for the last winter or autumn
campaign I can't move which one it was
but I got to choose a pair of shoes to
take home and these
my eye I couldn't leave without them I
until the color of them I think red is
my favorite color at the moment as you
can tell also this record is one of my
favorites as well by doing included
because that's right off I like a little
bit more I'm absolutely loving the color
bread at the moment I love how the
choice of square Tori I think that's
really another women yeah well I just
lovely fruit and I think my favorite
thing about them is if I'm just worrying
simple outfit chucking a pair of shoes
on that are typical really makes our
feel like stand on well and enjoy this
all right I feel like some people who
would find it hard to style these but I
literally wear these with everything and
anything any color any athlete anything
I've actually wanted with this spoke
before and I think it just pulls in
amazingly but lately I've been
absolutely loving color blocking I just
love being red colors together that
don't match because I feel like it just
adds a unique twist in the Opera and
mates look so much better my next few
favorites are two songs now I got so
many questions on my youtube channel
about what music I listened to or where
I get my music for my videos and just
what music I like in general so if any
of you have ever wondered what songs i
listen to or where i get my music for my
videos and stuff like that soundcloud is
