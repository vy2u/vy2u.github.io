my channel so today I decided to sit
down and film a question mask video
because you guys always awesome
questions and always ask me on the
question as we clear I thought why don't
the one today and plus I'm in a
different setup I am sitting on my bed
up in my red just because I wanted this
video specific to that and relaxed and
laid-back and comfy so yeah so I asked
you that on my Instagram path to ask me
some questions
by the way hug if you don't follow me on
Instagram I will leave it links here so
be sure to follow me on there and also
all my other social media accounts will
be links below so if you want to follow
me on any of those Kishore can see ya
just go ahead and job training clips I
took us so Australian I recently just
operated my Spotify to Spotify Premium
if you guys haven't done that and you
just need Spotify free honestly you have
to operate tooth photopack premium
because we definitely are mixing out I
love soda five so much now because I
have premium and can skip as many songs
as you want
so I've been listening to a heck lot
more music recently awesome isn't a new
song it's quite an old assignment now
but if you guys know me you know that
LSP apart is my no.1 favorite singer of
all time
but this month I think so Cespedes
carved your beautiful which is because I
love the meaning behind it I think it
does give a really meaningful message
and her voice in it is honestly just
heavenly
by the way all the funds I'm showing you
are all this ones that are in the chart
at the moment if you want me to do
another video of something talking about
all my other favourite songs from my
unknown artist and stuff so I noticed I
would definitely love to do that but the
next one is solid answer I just love the
beat up as long it is so good and it
literally puts me in that deep the best
Marie and her voice is incredible I
actually realized at 71 sigh be loving
this month but the unite one is a touch
Sultana song now she has recently just
blowing up I'm sure you guys have heard
about she is an incredible Australian
artist and I love literally or less
funds but my favorite one at the moment
is promotion and it is just so good
so yeah definitely went through service
on submarines but as I said I have so
many so many so I let me know if you
want me to do my video right on them
so the pattern call concerns right now
to be honest I probably somewhere in
America like LA or something like that
maybe New York as well I wanted to live
in America so I got well to be honest
I've never even been to America so I
don't even know if I love it but I feel
like I would love it I feel like I'm so
cool and so greedy there and I think
that career-wise
it would really benefit me as well so I
have a huge edge lately severe American
sore yes I mean I should say I wanted
with them because I went to read this or
bad but yes probably I do want to move
out of cellulite very very soon I really
wanted me to Brisbane or Sydney the
Bradley Brisbane because it is a lot
like purse but I do really want to move
out a path but just because I'd like to
for my career doesn't really have much
to offer so hopefully in the next year
or two I will be making it the big move
over there - true most asked questions
at the moment and you have invoices both
of them I'm going to be Bumbry ggm if
you were wondering a lot of people have
been asking me fun ways from the total
one I think but I'm going to fumble and
just because it's close to Perth and
bummers my hometown that's why I was
born so it's nothing to do with it to be
honest actually I want me to a lot of
you at GPM and swimming the graph I'm so
excited
my number-one goal for the future at the
moment is to get into modeling and sign
as an agency I would love to do high
fashion modeling that would literally be
my favorite thing and editorial and
stuff like that I just want to model so
bad so I really have to push myself and
do it I just seriously need to contact
an agency otherwise I'm going to get
nowhere because no one can help me but
myself to be honest I have no idea I
can't even at that question because
YouTube is my whole life
it's my job it's my passion it's what I
love to do as I can't see myself doing
anything other than YouTube because it's
just my whole life pretty much I'm
honestly so thankful and so grateful
that my hobby turns into my career and
my job and honestly I have no one else
to thank like you guys I would not be
here without you guys sorry honestly I'm
so grateful and so thankful for all your
love and support and I would not be able
to be doing just that I love if it will
see you guys a lot of questions about 13
reasons lies so we have ie Jessica are
probably when I saw just on the show I
honestly was like did I get an acting
job I think they just can look very
alike and I honestly thought I was
learning one that saw it I still asked
you guys and you guys said you think the
same as well three is what was your
Philips on obsession reasons why so I
just finished setting reasons why and I
bawled my eyes out it is such an eye or
not and it is so sad and it just breaks
my heart to know that people actually go
through those issues and their struggles
in the real world I never wish that sort
of struggle upon anyone who they
honestly seems like the hardest thing in
the whole wide world I what you guys to
know that you Vieira are in that
situation there is always someone to
talk to you don't be afraid to talk to
your friends and family because trust me
they will care number three is who is
your favorite character from obsession
right away boom
probably clay I just smear actually
probably clay and Tony because I find
them so sweet I feel like they can
and care so much about wanting to help
the situation I just love them and I
think that's what cute a lot of people
ask me this and I feel like when people
see me in person
I am expecting that high school as a
house and for ago but a lot of people
when I see me in person maker oh my god
is so little and I don't even mean like
hot little old bony little and with the
time and I say that I am sending that to
Shawnee and Shawnee is a freaking giant
but I am 170 centimeters so I guess you
guys can determine if I'm cool or French
school but I think I'm like normal total
height for Joe and found dead off all my
vote I was literally just hanging out
with like a bunch of American youtubers
when they're beautiful be anti flop and
now I popped up saying it set up and
iconic they're like new vocabulary like
coming to mind and I keep saying truth
were especially dead off I always like
to set up I feel like up so straight
away I say how be American sighted dead
ass did it but I feel like I'm saying
dad as fun hands down my favorite robot
is change Oakland I love him
he is so funny I feel like he has such
an amazing sense of humor and I feel
like we would literally be like two peas
in a pod
organic crates you know what honestly I
don't know what goes through his mind
like tons of stuff he says and some
stuff he does I'm like who unlike you
I'm not human but he is so so funny and
so doctor and I'm sure if you guys fill
remiel search we do you were very
expressive link set up it Braxley
I really should make some sense anyone
or shadow anyone's dreams but I hate
pasta I honestly do not like available I
refuse to eat it I don't know what I
don't like about it but I just don't
like it
now I have a lot of different fashion
inspirations such as like kendall Jenner
I think high fashion is freaking amazing
but one of my favorites at the moment
that I've been loving is actually a
fellow youtuber and that is Amanda still
I think she is kick off the hottest
thing to walk the planet she's such cool
fashion that she is so edgy and cool and
I do honestly think she's like a
cheap-ass bitch high fashion is slow
Kayla and I love it but I really just
like you I don't know how but I
physically just forgot I was filming a
video and start my friend for about half
an hour
I literally be my forget the person in
the oh my god but I really had enjoyed
this video and if you did that please
don't forget to give it a massive thumbs
up and subscribe to join you I heard you
all having a beautiful day and I'll
speak you'll very</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
