back to my channel so today I'm filming
my very first story time video I never
thought I'd film a story time video on
my channel because nothing interesting
or exciting happens to me ever so when I
sat down to film today I got this
awkward and like nervous and weird
feeling I've never felt like this before
and I don't know why I feel like this
it's just weird I think it's because oh
sorry I'm sorry different to what I
usually do but I really wanted to share
this story with you guys sorry I
actually wasn't planning on doing a
story time video area I was just maybe
gonna tell you guys on snapchat but I
feel my friends joked about me doing a
certain video on this and I was like oh
my god I'm actually going into the film
and story time video on this and for my
friends reaction when I told them
they're like oh my god
so I thought it would be really
interesting to share with you guys I
feel like a lot of you would find it
either insane or very interesting or
very like what are the chances of that
happening so yeah so today involves my
car my super bad luck and my super good
luck with my car and I'm kind of just
like in shock like as if that happened
like what are the chances of that
happening
so without further ado let's talk me
into it and I hope you guys find this
story it's super interesting
so actually obviously start from the
start for this story to make sense if
any of you guys follow me on snapchat or
Twitter maybe even Instagram I think I
met you on there actually know I
mentioned it in a video as well that I
got into a car crash I never told you
guys on YouTube or social media except
for snapchat how the car crash happened
and what happened so I'll quickly
employment eyes on how the car crash
happened I might get to in detail about
it because the story isn't based around
the actual car crash so yeah I'm going
to set the scene I was leaving my
boyfriend's house and it was a Tuesday
night at about 7:15 p.m. so I had just
gone Dhamma it was pouring with rain
that whole day so when I left the verse
were really wet but it was sprinkling a
bit when it happened so it was like
pouring down when the crash happened
sorry I just left my boyfriend's house
to their horn I was about two minutes
off his house and I got to a set of
traffic lights I put up to the traffic
lights and they went bread as I pulled
up so I was something for
five minutes waiting for my lights to go
green so when I saw it I was obviously
stopped out in front of the traffic
lights I was the first person that would
guard so when I went green I went to
very as you do and as I went to Gloria I
blink and next minute I realized it was
a car in front of me and I smashed into
it so what happened is as my light went
green Segura I went to glory and apart
from so I was going straight in a car
from this direction had came ran a red
light obviously and I smashed into the
back of him alley furnace here if you
guys want to see what happened or how
the cars looked yes so one minute I was
taking over next minute I blinked and
there was a car in front of me and I was
like oh my god so when I hit him I
looked to the left and I looked at his
car and he has kind of like spun five
times and smashed into the back of a
pole and it was so scary to me I was
like oh my god what's just happened what
the hell and if you have ever been in a
contract you would know it is the
scariest thing that could ever happen so
I don't know why this guy ran a red
light I don't know if he was on his
phone or if he was just out of it I
don't have no idea really but it was
really nice about it you did say it was
peaceful and so on the day after the car
crash I put my car in to get fixed and
they said it will be about a week when
you get it back style said okay cool a
week that my car no worries so I put my
car to get fixed and luckily my amazing
friend Rachel her dad actually owns a
Mazda dealership so they were sort of
kind enough to lend me a car for the
amount of time I've had it I'm so very
thankful because I would have probably
gone insane so are we gonna die and I
called them and I was like hey just
wondering where my car will be ready for
me to come pick it up and I'm like I'll
sorry we actually haven't started
working on it yet because insurance has
been pay so we can't work on is really
insurance was paid for it and I was like
oh my god great so we're going back and
forward smooth insurance seeing when I
would pay and they're like I will pay
out on this day they never paid it so
back and forth trying to get you it's
apparent they actually lost the phones
for my insurance and then found them and
then realize I'll shoot we'd better pay
it now so three weeks had gone by and it
finally got paid so my car I had just
been sitting in the car yard or workshop
for about three weeks just sitting there
doing nothing just sitting there just
being looked at
super weeks go by and then call us and
like a insurance is paid so we're able
to stop Ixia awesome good
you there like it should probably be
done in about a week so the next week
bones around and I get the bonus okay
just wondering if my car's right to be
picked up yeah and they're like we're
still waiting for one more piece to come
you should hopefully have it by next
week I was like okay awesome
no charlie so the next week rolls around
and I actually have to go into the shop
through why didn't want to call it card
shop workshop whatever you guys don't
I'm sorry God so the next thing girls
are on and I have to go in at to pick up
my number plate because my numbers light
was still on the back of my car the
front one had been destroyed but I did
end up getting that back the next day I
went to like the car crash scene and it
was lying on the floor so I had to get
them both to take to the licensing place
to sort them over for new place because
I always think that were damaged so I
couldn't put them back on my car so and
in there on about a Wednesday and is
that on Monday you should hopefully get
your car back Monday or Tuesday I was
like oh my god yes thank God by this
point just letting you know it had been
about five weeks since I had my cost or
my card being worked on for about five
weeks so Monday rolls around I pull up
and I probably buy this might never like
you have the most annoying customer York
I'll be ready when it's ready so I get
up and I was like hi is my car ready to
be picked up yet and they're like we
actually were to have it done by the end
of this week we're just waiting on one
more pot to get here so we'll probably
have it ready to eat on Friday but cool
off on Thursday and we'll see how it's
going by this point I've caught about 40
times and it's been about six weeks but
I was gonna do what she's gonna do is
get a call about it so they come
Thursday and I wasn't planning on
calling them because they did say it
would be ready for Friday and I'll
Society I had a feeling I was like maybe
it's ready so I gave him a call and I
was like hi just one who's my cause
ready to be picked up yet turns - no I
came home get it's Marie and he was like
to me as we started you supposed to get
your car on Friday but luckily we
finished early so you can come get it
today at about 3:30 and I was like there
is a good hallelujah I'm finally getting
my car back after six weeks this is
where it starts to get intense before I
get into the next part of the story I
just want you to know that I was
surprised to pick up my car at 11 a.m.
Friday morning but I ended up getting it
at 3:30 p.m. at this
afternoon so just remember I'll supposed
to get at Friday morning but I ended up
getting out on Thursday afternoon sorry
I haven't got my collar on Thursday
afternoon I was so happy it looked
amazing it was brand-new I was like whew
finally my car's been fixed go home
I was happy went to bed finally can put
the whole call situation and the crash
behind me it's done it still stood it so
I was like thank the Lord no more
freaking messing with my car and having
to get rental cars and stuff like that
it is finally okay in a second notes not
kind of I kind of know sorry I was on
the next morning on the Friday morning
when I was surprised to get my call
everything was so good
us getting ready for the day because I
actually had a few errands to run so
yeah I was just getting ready to wake up
and then at Brandon's mom comes in and
she was like you not believe it have a
look at this and I was like oh my god so
she passing the phone and it was a news
article and I just quickly skim through
it and I kind of was like yeah what do
you mean I didn't really pick up on
anything I just kind of skipped around
on it yeah what do you mean and they
should tell me and I was like oh my god
and my heart just went from here to here
my heart literally sank and I was
sitting there and I was like what are
the chances as if that's happened
so as I said I was suppressing in my
part and Friday morning at 11 a.m. when
I ended up getting it at 3:30 p.m. on
Thursday afternoon three hours after I
picked up my car at 6:45 p.m. the whole
card and the whole workshop blew up in
flames a fire started and everything got
destroyed everything got burnt all the
cars in the workshop getting fixed got
burnt and destroyed and everything just
caught on fire pretty much I picked up
my car three hours before that happened
and I was supposed to pick it up on the
Friday morning so when I read the news
article asked when I just didn't and I
was like what are the chances of that
happening like I cannot believe it first
second to a car crash then I have to
wait six weeks for my car to get fixed
because insurance doesn't pay and I can
wait for a pace to pump and then my car
would have got burnt that would have
just been the cherry on top of this
whole situation just top it off just
everything that little bit extra perfect
that would have been the cherry on top
of all of it
I literally cannot believe how lucky I
am that I got to pick up my car three
hours before it just like I was kind of
just in there and I was like oh my
goodness what are the chances of that
happening I guess God was just telling
me I think she's had enough drama with
this car we'll just we'll just let her
rest so yeah that is the story of how my
car could have always got caught on fire
I seriously could not begin to imagine
what I would be feeling or how emotional
or how depressed I would be if my car
caught on fire because my car is like my
life to me when I crushed it I was so
upset I was like so say I was a mess and
if I'm gonna overs code on file
whoo I didn't want to think about that
but I really do be guys enjoyed this
