back to my channel so today I was going
to sit down and feel my church and get
ready with me and I was going to feel
like a peachy makeup look but I realized
I don't have any lashes at my house
right now and I slowly for me not to
have lashes so I don't know what
happened to them all and because it is
Good Friday because it is the Easter
weekend no shots or essence so I
couldn't go out and get any so I was
sitting down and thinking what else
crash film today and then I decided I
told you guys I would fill my everyday
makeup look sorry I thought today would
be the perfect time to sumer because
I've been wearing in a bunch in all my
recent videos and you guys have been
requesting my everything is have looked
like crazy the makeup look I'm going to
be showing you guys today is probably
like my favorite go to make a look at
the moment I've been wearing it to a
bunch of event and just when I grow out
because it is just super fresh and glowy
and slowness and usually when I do wear
this to an event I was chopping up our
blushes and that's not it well so can we
just quickly talk about the fact that I
have a ring light my relight finally
arrives and I'm sorry papi I don't know
how the lining with Lopes because I
haven't tested it out yet so this is the
first video that I'm trying out I hope
it does change my lighting game and
picks it up a little bit more so if you
guys would like to see how I've been
wearing my makeup lately then let's just
jump straight into it and I hope you
enjoy I've already want to have M times
with my Too Faced owners of primer I
usually like to do this last time reduce
because I hate waiting for it to dry and
it takes a while so I usually apply this
before I start filming so I just applied
a fake tan so usually what I'm not fake
tan I like to use the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation shade natural beige
so this is my unbeatens color but that
is like 20% of the time majority of my
life I'm fake tans or I have a natural
tan because in summer I go quite far
this is my foundation come burn I need
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
in the shade of noir beige
any NARS sheer glow foundation in the
shade at fast ammonal or medium for born
in so is like my all-time favorite
foundation I use this on my clients as
well I love this foundation so much so
let's just shake these off and
it's my face oh I was so sad I really
wanted to sit down and film and she
check it ready with me today like pootie
guys that look going on in my life right
now and all sorts of things but I just
can't do it without lashes like I could
have done another my couples but I feel
like their makeup look is complete
without lashes then I'm just taking my
Real Techniques Beauty sponge and I'm
going to blend this out this is really
disgusting and trend right now so I need
to clean that but I should also say that
I do my foundation on a day-to-day basis
I will only wear it if I have a lot of
errands tree or I have meetings or I'm
touching up with friends or something
an ultimate as well either wear makeup
every single day at most days I would
just wear a tiny bit of concealer or
something but if I don't wear foundation
I would just pretty much put on a tiny
bit of concealer and powder and that's
about it
hating on sequence Allah I like to use
the mouse bring a creamy concealer in
the shade custard this is one of my
all-time favorite concealers I actually
tried the heart-shaped eight when I went
to Brisbane I tried shiny and to be
honest I absorb in timeline so that I
don't know why I will have to give it
another go but when I first try to also
am I going like this and then I use of
the next day and I wasn't sure I'm
definitely going to give it another go
because I really only tried at time
sorry I like some fighters just on my
eyes and down the bridge of my nose I
will slice some of this on my forehead
and my chin maybe not too exciting under
the eyes I have to do this quite quick
because every single concealer I use it
fits into my fine line so if you guys
know any really good eye creams that
help with fine lines I mean that a
little bit under the eyes please let me
know because my just so bad i I just I
need help let me know
so you tried to start under my eyes I
use my Alexandria contour palette but
this one has definitely seen better days
I've used it down to the core so I need
to get any one of those button
replacement to that I've been using the
Australis banana powder now I do want to
quickly say a lot of people do pick up
on this so in my first I hate me I did
use the Australis contour palette and I
did say that I absolutely hated the
banana shade in that palette because it
was chalky and it was yellow and it was
gross I'd realistically say they did
actually reformulate the Australis
powder and put it in a compact this one
is so much more finely milled it's so
much a nice light not heavy another
thing I find really funny as well it is
not yellow yeah a few people did get up
me about that because I won't you said
you hated it and now you're using it
this one is reformulated and it is
completely different and it is so so
much better than the one in palette
and decide the rest of the face i use my
trusty old that i've been using since I
was like India eight for like 60 degrees
holy crap six years ago six years ago
that is insane this is the Australian to
Alice in the shade darkest Brown sorry
I'm just going to set the rest of my
face you know I find really weird about
the Australia's question flawless
pressed powder it's they came out with a
few new shades or like medium ten and
then actually no the other ones alone
always medium ten anyway moral of the
story they made new shades to much more
people screaming but mediums ten is we
let a shade a few lighters and darkest
Brown I got medium tan the other day I
put it on and I realized it is so much
darker than darkest Brown and it is also
orange base so when I used it my face
was like bright orange it is phobia
sorry I have been absolutely loving the
new hoola light bronzer by benefit holy
 guys this is incredible so this is
a really really good at making your
cheekbones look really natural and it's
just such an amazing color I feel like
if you have it really tan skin and
you're worried that this will lead to
like you definitely give it a go because
instance that good any totally turns it
up as well which I really like you can
make it darker than what actually is but
if sorry freaking that I cannot
recognize it enough
I'm just going to take this all about
and slightly console my nose I have to
do this every single day of my life
I cannot go a day without contouring my
nose just because it makes my nails look
so much slimmer I quite a big nose
[Laughter]
moving onto another product that I don't
think I could ever live without because
it is another one at my favorite product
this is the two-faced milk chocolate
Soleil bronzer holy crap guys this is my
favorite bronzer in the whole by God as
you can see I kept an hour just a light
bronze up the skin and have a really
nice soft light onto the skin and I do
like to apply this on a real techniques
a powder brush this is huge this is
actually bigger than my own powder brush
as you can see is really really big but
I love using a bigger brush just because
I feel like it brings up more of the
base because pretty much every single
area so I like to apply this just along
my cheekbones and on my temples
that's funny weird if you guys have this
have you ever tried it like this taste
so good I think months ago I was doing
my makeup and I went from here and I
actually picked it out and as I sweep it
up I inhaled it and I was like oh my god
that tastes so good so now I just do
like a cheeky little my earring is like
losing it moving on to blush I've
been loving the two phase of sweet peach
glow palette this is so incredible with
this gives such a nice cooler to the
skin and make this room look really
chewy and fresh so I love it mixing the
blush and the bronzer and applying it to
my teeth as a blush just because as I
said I do prefer bronzer change I used
to never go near pinky blush turns out
all justify so I didn't suit them but
now I've been loving like a peachy or
pinky blush turns on myself I just think
it makes me look more to our and I don't
know why I just feel like it just makes
it look like pretty
and maybe on your holiday I love using
the highlighter in the sweet peach blue
palette the reason why I love it so much
is because it isn't a chalky or powdery
or glittery highlight up it is a really
really nice Julie look and I always feel
like it gives your face like a wet look
I don't know if you guys have ever seen
that was a highlighter but when you like
move your face it looks like a
highlighter it's like wet I like to just
quickly go ahead and spritz my face
within that preppin science Bible even
within mac fix+ this is just to soak up
any unnecessary powder values that are
sitting on the face and just hang
everything look really fresh and dewy
and not cakey
I was actually on the job still the
other day trying to find my new dress so
forgot so I could film a dress no makeup
tutorial service or exercises fun by
negligence is the Maybelline brow sudden
jus a rah pencil so it has the brow
crayon I guess you would say it's not
really a pencil for the brow clown on
one end and then some brow powder on the
other end it's really really soft on the
brows and it makes about it really
natural and it just stays all day and I
love it and I like to just take any
random clear bra Jo and set my brows and
I also like Lee um brush my brow head
I'll just to make them look a little bit
more fluffy and naturally
I honestly feel like I think that means
my public sorry
long yeah I have maybe on two guys I
usually just apply some Massaro or I
like to run a brown transition shade
through my crease so lately I've been
absolutely loving the Kylie Armitage
shallot and I have been freaking
obsessed with this brown shade here
called sandy this is like the perfect
transition shade sorry I just like to
focus this through my crease and on my
RV and that's not allowed with I show
you on a day-to-day basis moving on to
mascara I have another convoy that I've
been absolutely loving so first I like
to take the several tinted primer by
benefit and I apply this to my top and
lower lashes and then I like to go over
with the Maybelline illegal night yeah
now moving in now moving in now moving
on I like to take the highlighting shade
from the sweet peach palette and I like
to apply this onto my inner corners just
to highlight my inner corners and make
my eyes a little bit bigger
I usually alternate between different
shades when I do this like I usually use
a gold Smith in the inner corners but
today I feel like using this peach shade
just to match my cheeks I'm taking the
hourglass I don't actually know what
this is called but it is just like an
hourglass um lip crayon I guess you
would call it and this is in the shade
at futurist now if you haven't tried
these you are not living these are these
best lip products I've ever used worse
timing that my camera just died so it's
a position
changed that is life but I think I was
talking about how moisturizing and last
longing last plumbing long lonely
logging do I say that right Lonnie so my
favorite shade is the shade at futures
now I love this because it is pretty
much the same color as my natural lip
but there are see that I alternate
between I also really like peace menthol
just like true shades darker than this
so I wear this usually when my makeup is
a little bit more intense and bold but I
actually swap out between like five
different areas of these but this one is
probably my favorite whenever I'm with
someone I might be have to try this on
and they're like holy crap
I'm like I know this is the completed
look so I remove you guys enjoyed this
tutorial if you do that please don't
forget to give it a massive thumbs up
and subscribe if you're new I love you
guys to leave some comments below on
what video I should film or what makeup
looks you like to see because that would
be a huge help
I hope you're all having an amazing day
and I'll speech you all very very soon
