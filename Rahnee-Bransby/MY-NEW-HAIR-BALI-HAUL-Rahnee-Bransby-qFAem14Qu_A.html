my channel thank you so much for
watching so just before I get started
with today's video I just want to point
out the obvious you guys may have
noticed you may not have noticed most of
you probably already know by my
Instagram and it's all my social media
accounts but I have changed my head so I
do get my head cut and colored for
anyone wondering I got it done out
circles of Subiaco so if you are from
Perth I highly recommend going to see
them because they are the most amazing
bunch of girls and not only are they all
freaking it's so sunny but they do such
an amazing job on your hair and my hair
is just so healthy and looks so amazing
now and I'm so happy with it so I am no
longer a brunette I guess I'm really
only brunette about this month which is
the top of my head I did still want to
keep a bit of my natural hair color just
because I wasn't sure how I would look
fully blonde but the rest of my hair is
blonde and can I just say I am so
freakin happy with how it turned out and
looks I'm actually feels so much more
comfortable with myself now but I just
feel like this hairstyle really does
suit me I never in a million years
thought I would ever dye my hair blonde
or go close to being kind of blonde and
now that I have I freaking love it and
I'm so obsessed with it
so I'm loving it so I did get a cut and
a full head of ombre foils so if any of
you guys want me to film a video just
basically talking about my hair what
they did what products I used and just
for you see to the video all about my
hair so if that's something you guys
would like to see please let me know
because I would definitely love to feel
that for you guys so yeah I'm going to
stop rambling and get on into the action
point of this video
let's go today I'm filming my Bali fool
now this video has been a requested it's
so incredibly much I literally didn't
think I didn't have a thought about
doing a bali home because first of all I
didn't find that much like I only have
about five or maybe ten items here that
I bought from Bali and - I didn't think
you guys would want to see it but this
video has been impressed with so
incredibly much was sorry I still
thought I would film it for you guys
because I love you guys have been asking
for and a lot of you guys have asked
when I picked up in Bali so I was like
hey I'm just gonna film it even though I
don't didn't get that much stuff let's
go last thing that I bought I'm just
gonna quickly push aside and get through
it because it is a very important but it
is just the clinic liquid facial soap
oily skin a formula this stuff is
amazing when I was in Bali I actually
ran out of my face wash and this is the
one I use so I decided to you pick it up
so this is the face wash I use every
single day clears up my skin like crazy
it is amazing so if you are looking for
a new face wash and you do have quite
all this skin I do recommend this bad
boy because it does clean my skin up and
it works wonders
the nice thing I picked up were two
pairs of faces so these babies were in
three dollars and when I saw these I was
like oh my god I need them in my life
the pattern of these bags are freaking
amazing I was like oh my god I need
those in my life so bad so these are
true full pizza things it's really cute
red blue and cream attachment one this
is my favorite one out of the truth the
colors go so well with my skin tone and
the pattern of it is amazing I'm so
obsessed with it like seriously how cute
you guys have probably seen a photo of
me wearing it I'll wait inside it heal
if you haven't but that's just what it
looks like on and yeah I'm obsessed with
this and the next one I picked up is
just this blue and beige colorful piece
I love the pattern on this one too and I
also love how these are like high-rise
like so they stick just above your hip
that is really cool I just love how
high-rez they are and yeah they're so
comfy and they I really made them into
they're just like normal fabric
materials so you can't get away with
wearing these just as a cool piece but
with some jeans or some short supplies
so I freaking love these two phases what
am i doing I've no idea so I will leave
the name of the store just here where I
got them because I have no idea how to
pronounce that the next thing I picked
up is this adorable purple and gold crop
top first of all I love you pattern of
it that's why I got it the pun just
caught my eye and the style of it as
well so it's just this really nice
high-necked crop top and the back has
this really cool little cutouts in it as
well I can't remember the name of where
I got this so I'm so sorry but it is
from a surf shop so it is probably in
Australia as well so the next two things
I picked up were from Zara so the first
thing I picked up with these planner
pair of shorts this just kind of like a
pinky kind of beige kind of color kind
of I feel like I said kind of 10 times
Justin and I have this reread or some
light detailing on the front with
threads so that is what the front looks
like and the bike has these really cute
pockets and the same detailing as well
just under the pockets and yes I ever
wear that little piece is coming out I'm
gonna have to stitch that back in
because I - the next thing I picked up
is one of my favorite pieces of clothing
that that I bought in Bali just before I
show you guys this item I could have
onto it for me if you do see any little
black marks and it just please ignore
them because I did put this piece of
clothing in my dryer and my dryer must
have had something in it before or
something that it did put black marks on
my clothing so I'm going to have to
bleach this out or something but they're
really tiny is not really to see them
but you might be able to sir please just
you know that oh so it is just this
white dress
um this is my favorite summer dress ever
I'm obsessed with this dress it's so
comfy and it goes with this really cute
rope detailing on the front so you can
like wear really tight or wear it cut
open the Mushaf in a cleavage which I
don't
because I'm her boobs so I can't do that
and towards about it being has these
really massive like massive pockets on
each side which I love so that is what
the dress looks like I'm in love with
this dress I think it's so groovy and
different and now for the very last two
things that I picked up in Bali I told
you this home was probably going to be
these shows how you've ever seen in your
life but these two things I say to
laughs because they are my favorite
things that I did pick up in Bali they
just amazing so are you guys ready these
are from both the same shop and I'm not
too sure what it was called I'm really
sorry so the first thing I picked up was
this freaking stunning bag can we just
take a moment
this bag is absolutely freaking amazing
personally we just look in the color
like this is stunning this car I have
been obsessing about the moment I've
literally purchased like four different
clothing items this color it's like a
mustard e-tag color and I'm obsessed
with it so it is just a leather bag and
it looks alike this and it has these
really cool suede like fringing all
around the back it has this really
awesome like detailing and threads
across on the flap of the bag and I just
asked me what with it it goes with so
many things and I am literally in love
with this bag it's like one of my
favorite so it is just this must be tan
color the same color as the bag vest it
is so pretty so it's just a suede
material vest and it has all these holes
in it like all over the vessel
everywhere and across the bottom we
cannot forget about the fringe at the
bottom has all this fringe across it and
makes bridges like my favorite
this dress is so comfortable and soft
the one thing I love about this vest is
it is so different and unique and it's
not something you would see many people
are in or wear which is awesome I love
the color awareness style of it and I
just think it is the prettiest thing in
the world I just love it so much so much
so so much sorry if that is everything
that I picked up in Bali I hope you guys
all enjoyed this video if you did please
give this video a massive thumbs up
because it doesn't mean the world to me
and helps me out so so so so so so much
please leave me in the comments below
what thing that I got from Bali was your
favorite because I would love to know
what you liked the most
I think that's all I have to share with
you guys so until my next video I will
