I'm like oh hi everyone and welcome back
to my channel so today I'm filming a
whole video and this is an exciting
video because I don't think I've ever
filmed a full focused makeup haul video
so today I'm filming a makeup geek hole
and swatch video because I recently got
some makeup geek eyeshadows in the mail
which I was super excited for and when I
got these I'll say yes I need to show my
subscribers I need to share this with
them because I was so excited for this I
was a little too excited so I'm going to
be swatching all the shapes for you and
telling you a little bit about them and
telling you about the palettes and stuff
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
this is a palette here this is easy
palette they sell these on the makeup
geek website and I do come in different
sizes and colors as well the world is a
palette is it is just a magnetic empty
palette which you buy on it's alright
and the back of it is magnetic so when
you collect the pans you just click them
onto the back and it just sticks to the
back like this this is the medium sized
one and I didn't actually realize how
small it was going to be it fits about
15 eyeshadows in and I kind of regret
not getting the large so I'm going to
have to upgrade to the lodge so I have
12 shades in my palette I've organized
them from darkest to lightest because I
really like iffy about that sort of
stuff
I got like really bad anxiety when
things are in order so I think I'm going
to start at the lightest shade and work
my way up so let's go ahead and jump
right on into the swatches so the
penetrate we have here is white lies and
this is just a pure matte white shade
now I have never in my life seen and why
I shadows sorry pigmented it is crazy I
absolutely love this eyeshadow I think a
white eyeshadow is a must in everyone's
makeup
a lot of white ash of this I've used in
the past have noir you admit to them at
all like they just come out like a soft
kind of a shade but this is like what
and I mean like stock why it's so bright
so I absolutely love this white
eyeshadow so the next shaping up here is
a shimmer shimmer and this is just a
shimmery champagne shade with a pink
contouring
now this is like one of the most raised
about eyeshadow store makeup pick I
think so when I saw it I was it yep I
need it I absolutely love my shimmery
highlighting shades and I love using
this on the inner corner and Bravo to
highlight and say also I actually love
using this on the lid i used on the lid
the other day and it just make my eyes
look startling awake and glowy and I
love it so when I saw this I was like
yep a champagne shimmery color is
definitely my highlighting shade I can
never have enough of these shades and I
also actually use this the other day on
my high points of my face and it was
amazing as a highlighter so I don't know
how this I showed you can use like four
different types of purposes
the next shade we have is Peach Smoothie
and this is just a gorgeous peach shade
with a bit of an orange undertone now I
absolutely love using this as a
transition shade and this is one of
those shades that suits every single
skin tone when I am doing people's
makeup I do use this in the crease and
as a transition shade for any skin tone
I think it just works so well with every
skin tone keep saying that but it does
this is also another raised about makeup
geek eyeshadow I love using this to
blend out dark colors in the crease or
just to use it as just like an everyday
crease color just active my eye crease a
little bit more depth and the formula of
this eyeshadow is so buttery and creamy
it blends out storm easy and just can't
even like begin to express how creamy
and buttery it is the feeling of it is
just amazing and I absolutely love it
using this to blend I set that a lot but
it's good to blend so the next shape we
have here is creme brulee and I do
believe this is just a shade darker than
Peach Smoothie and a bit more on the
brown side so it's just like this sandy
brown and beige shade with a matte
finish this shade is my most used in my
palette so far I use this all the time
but I love this show
obviously in the crease I love using
Olivas lid I just love it in general and
as I said it is my slightly my voice use
eyeshadow I've ever used in this palette
the nightshade we have here is frappe
now this is another shade darker than
creme brulee it's more of a medium toned
caramel brown shade now I love using
this in the outer V and the lash line
just to darken up and you make it look
and give it a bit more warmth I
definitely do love my brown eyeshadow
shades and I don't think you can ever go
wrong with an amazing medium toned Brown
and I also think this is a must in it
sounded really Australian then and I
also do believe this is a muster you
have in Ellen's afternoon collection
this also has a matte finish so the next
shape we have is chickadee now this is
just a matte orange shade with a yellow
undertone and when I saw this element
yeah
meet that yep get in that because if any
of you are unaware orange is my favorite
color
and it is also my favorite eyeshadow
color I'm actually wearing it on my lid
today so I think orange is a national
shape that you below or you hate but I
absolutely adore it and I do think
orange looks so good on people with
really dark skin tones like it just
makes their features pop amazingly so
this was one of the shapes I was super
excited for so the next shape we have
here is roulette and this is just a rosy
band tap pink shake with a bit of a
brown undertone I absolutely love this
shade I feel like I love every shade
because I do but this is literally one
of my favorite shades I love wearing
this on the lid I wore this on my live
yesterday and it just like reflected and
I've got so many compliments on the
shade because it is just gorgeous the
one thing I love about the shimmery
eyeshadows from makeup geek which this
shade actually made me realize it is
they say on all day like some other
shimmery eyeshadows that I've used in
the past the glitter separates from the
color of it and it just like makes your
eyelid really messy or like makes it
look like you're missing a shadow that
you didn't apply it there in certain
places in the morning and these are just
phenomenal they stains but all day the
glitter doesn't separate or just throw
it all over your eye and I definitely
don't notice out the invitation or day
from the time I applied in the morning
or whatever and I take it off in the
afternoon it still looks like fresh it
still looks like I've just apply it so I
absolutely love these shimmery
eyeshadows from makeup geek I love all
of the eyeshadows the next shade we have
here is bitten now this is another shake
that is so great about so I had to try
it out it is just a deep maroon red
shade with a pat pat finish and that's
finish I absolutely love this shade I
think my Marines are my favorite
eyeshadow shades ever so when I got this
I was so excited to try it and these are
just so buttery and creamy and so easy
to blend which I absolutely love and
makes it so much easier to work with so
this is the shade of burlesque and this
is very similar to bitten it is that
like deep maroon red shade this fall's a
bit more on the pinky side and it does
have a shimmery finish I will actually
compare the two together for you guys so
as you can see this is bitten this is
more on the red tone side and it's a bit
more darker and this is a shade fair
less and it falls on the more pinky side
with a shimmery finish so the next shape
we have here is mocha now this is just a
dark matte brown shade it kind of
reminds me of a chocolatey brown shade
as I said I love my brown shade so I
think that dark brown matte shade is
definitely what you need in your
eyeshadow collection I love using it to
smoke out the lower lash line lets you
darken the crease or out of me and yeah
I'm using this on my out of me today and
seriously in my opinion is the perfect
matte brown shade to the second law
shade I have to share with you guys is a
little bit out of my comfort zone I saw
it and I was like wow that is so
stunning I love to play with that shade
so this is in the shade Envy now this is
just a deep metallic green shade with a
shimmery finish
I love playing around with new your eyes
shadows and different colors and
creating new looks so when I saw this I
thought it was so beautiful I've
actually never seen a national shade
like this before and I love green so I
think this will be awesome to work in a
tutorial I have to somehow come up with
how I'm going to work this in a tutorial
but if you want to see your tutorial
with this Ashley shade please let me
know because I think it's beautiful now
the last show that I have to share with
you guys is in the shade corrupt now
this is just your typical matte black
shade now I actually feel a black smoky
eyes
you know I did mention this in one of my
recent videos before and I didn't
actually have any map black eye shadows
that was so pigmented the ones I do have
aren't very pigmented so I really had to
put this on my list you just put like
one little bit on your eye and it's just
like it's just like boom if there you
know it's there you can see it
that's how pigmented it is so I think
this is the perfect matte black shade
because black is really hard to work
with if it has a lot of fallout you can
want to makeup look or if it just looks
too grainy worried you're kind of dodgy
so I think this black eye shadow is the
case might hard so that is nothing
makeup geek eyeshadows I have to share
with you guys today I really hope you

please don't forget to give it a massive
thumbs up especially give it a thumbs up
