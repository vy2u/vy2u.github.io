back to my channel so today I filmed
this rose nude eye makeup look and I
paired it with a purple lip at first I
wasn't too sure about the purple loop
but I actually think the purple it
really complements the eye color and I
love how it looks I was assault two days
ago and I posted a snapchat of it before
I went out that night on the snapchat of
course and a lot of you guys actually
requested this makeup look so I thought
I'd film all for you guys to get what
did I just say I thought I would feel
more all I thought I would feel up for
all of you guys today so if you guys
would like to see how to achieve this
makeup look then please keep watching
and let's jump straight into move sorry
i've already done majority of my bass
and my eyebrows so i'm going to start
out by contouring with the hula benefit
bronzer and i'm just going to be
contouring my cheekbones my jawline my
temples and my nose of course and i'm
using a zoeva 126 lot cheek finish brush
to do so and this is actually a blush
brush but i like to use a for contouring
because i think it gives a better effect
see ya
now let's move on to the eyes so I'm
taking the models prefer rose nude
eyeshadow palette and I'm taking the
cheek inspiration and this is just like
a gorgeous dusty rose shade and I'm just
blending this into the crease as my
transition shade and now going in with
the shade movement I'm just going to be
working this on the outer V and the
crease and I'm doing this with a zoeva
227 luck soft definer brush and this is
my all time favorite brush I use this
all the time like every single day as we
actually it is amazing blend so easy and
yeah I absolutely love this brush that's
weird where do I love a brush so much I
don't all right and after the lid and
taking the shade inspiration now there
are two shades named inspiration which
i'm not sure why they have the same name
but anyway so i'm just talking this over
the lid and this is just like a rose
gold shade and it is seriously just like
pure glitter it's so stunning and i'm
obsessed with the shade it's like my
favorite shade ever and then once I've
applied that and just blending through
the crease once again and the shade does
have a lot of fallout but when you like
brush off the fallout it doesn't um like
leave marks or anything it's just really
easy to dust off so that's what I'm
doing now and yeah and now going back in
with the shade at movement I'm just
running this along my lower lash line
and smoking it out to give us a smokey
effect and I'm doing this on a zoeva 226
smudger brush and this video is not
sponsored by so Weaver I just love their
brushes they are seriously my favorite
so yeah as you can see right now I'm
just smoking that out and yeah I've
gotta stop saying and yeah I just say it
when I don't know what state me
mascara and just creating my top and
lower lashes now I didn't want to I
didn't want to apply falsies for this
make a look because I really wanted to I
shadow to stand out and I didn't want
the falsies to like take away the
attention from the eyeshadow i guess you
could say so yeah but if you want to
apply Foxy's definitely go for it they
would look so good but I just didn't
really want to for this makeup look and
now going back into the palette and
taking the shade of fantasy and this is
just like a gorgeous pearl white shade
and I'm just put a little Oh got clean
tired and I'm just um applying this on
my unity adult and Raburn to highlight
and I am doing this with a let me just
get it oh I'm doing this with a mac 219
brush that was seriously like perfect
timing now for blush I'm taking the
mineral bait soft touch blush by models
prefer and I'm just taking the pink and
brown shade and just tossing this over
my cheeks and blending it up to where my
contour is
I'm going to be taking the same mineral
bait soft touch blush and I'm just
taking the champagne che tu highlights
now this is a very sheer highlighter but
when it is on the skin it gives like a
really gorgeous blue but it isn't very
pigmented but it's still pretty so yeah
I'm just applying this to be high points
of my face so my cheekbones my eyebrow
my nose etc etc and now for the very
last step I'm taking the maybelline
colorsensational lipstick in the shade
elegant lilac and just applying this to
my lips and this is so gorgeous I'm
obsessed with this shade I just love it
I taste of love it but if you don't
think the purple suits with the I log
you can totally rock out a nude or
anything you like and then that is a
completed makeup look so if you guys
enjoyed this tutorial please don't
forget to give it a massive thumbs up
because it means a while to me and helps
me out so much and I'll speak to you all
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
