my channel so today I have a super
exciting video and it was so very
requested video today I have to end up
with a banovic planner to show you guys
my morning skincare routine and a Julie
fresh everyday makeup look which is this
one on my face right here I have also
heard you guys up with a rockin discount
code which will save you 70% off the
entire store which is so awesome so I'll
leave that links below and I will also
leave it vanity planet and the products
I use down below as well sorry I think
that's find this video helpful in any
way and I'm going to start off with
skincare so let's jump into it so here
is me trying to show you guys all the
brushes and then everything falls out
the typical me so this is what comes in
the brush set we have the pumice stone
the body brush the exfoliating facial
brush the daily cleansing brush and the
water resistant handle every morning I
like to use the facial daily cleansing
brush I use the exfoliating brush about
twice a week and that is only at
nighttime because I find it a little bit
harsh on my skin to use every single day
because I have a very sensitive skin so
just probably on the daily cleansing
facial brush head and the cleanser I
like to use is the Burt's Bees sensitive
facial cleanser this cleanser is all
natural and it is very gentle on the
skin it really gets in there and clears
out all the dirt and yucky grossest in
your pores and I just find ever since I
started using it it has cleared out my
skin like crazy like my skin has never
been this clear before it works
amazingly so I'm just starting out by it
wetting my face and they're popping up a
size of this onto the brush and just
using circular motions I'm going to do
this for about a minute or two and
really deep clean my face find is so
important to cleanse your face in the
morning before playing makeup or
anything like that just
any excess out of your face now I'm just
washing up the cleanser and then I'm
going to be towel drying my face
I honestly swear by this thin brush I
would never promote something to guys I
don't believe in and I find this has
cleared my skin like crazy so I really
wanted to share it with you guys today
now I'm going to be taking the ultra
sitacles UV protective daily moisturizer
as it binds to my skin this stuff is
amazing it provides such a Julie fresh
look to the skin and then once that is
all rubbed in that is my completed
morning skincare routine very simple and
easy because I like to focus more on my
skincare routine at night time yeah
let's move on to the makeup so now that
the skincare is done and I'm looking a
lot more refreshed and awake I'm going
to move on to the makeup so as I
mentioned in the intro I'm going to be
using the vanity plan and it's makeup
brushes today this is them here they are
so gorgeous I'm so excited to use these
because I was feeling them before and
they feel so soft like I'm so excited to
see how they work and how they go and
nothing is better than soft face brushes
so I also do a close up over on the
brushes but this is what they look like
here and they're just silver and wooden
with the wooden handles and the
synthetic brush hairs at the top I love
how these look I used to not be a big
fan of the whole wooden style brushes
but now I absolutely love it but now I
absolutely love them because they look
so like it's been changing the way I'm
going to be starting with climates paint
this is the true face to hang of it hi
Marcus it's a very moisturizing premise
so this is going to keep the skin nice
and moist you know I hate that word I
don't know I just set it up for a Julie
fresh makeup look you want to use
products that are going to keep the face
very moisture
I'm very fresh and glowy so this primer
is perfect for that
sorry I suggests don't use a mattifying
or silicon base primer because that is
going to flood the skin and it is going
to give up that healthy chewy fresh
flirt all right I'm just going to start
working this into the skin with my
fingers
now I'm not going to be using a
foundation today because I want this to
be very fresh and like minimal make-up
splurt I'm going to be using the chichi
super CC cream and this stuff is amazing
it does actually have full coverage for
a CC cream if you don't know what a CC
cream is is very similar to a baby cream
but it is very fresh and very chewy and
it's very light on the skin as well it
doesn't feel like you have a lot of
product to the skin which is perfect
today oh and the brush I'm going to be
using and these actually doing how to
thank them so I'm just going to try my
best to explain it it's just like a
powder brush or a foundation brush but
I'm just going to use this build the
foundation today
okay straight up the bat this brush is
so soft
oh my goodness
to be concealing on to my eyes and down
the bridge of my nose just to make my
eyes look a little bit more weight and
make me look a little bit more refreshed
and glowy
I just got ahead in a pipe a concealer
and now I'm going to blend it out
underneath my eyes with this synthetic
brush here which is just like a mini
paddle brush I'm going to use this tree
top it very close onto my eyes and then
I'm going to use these same brush that I
used for my base just to blend
everything out seamlessly
and now I'm just going in with the
Australis freshman flow espresso powder
in the shade darkest Brown and I'm going
to lightly set the rest of my face
I said lightly because this can be a
very mattifying powder so I'm going to
do it very very lightly just like that
doesn't or like stickiness so that it's
easy to blend out like bronzer I always
be taking it the tiny little kabuki
brush to set the rest of my face
and now I'm going to be taking as had a
bit of bronzer on this contour brush
this is just like an angled contour
brush and I'm going to lightly sweep
that on the out of questions on my face
and on my nose just to add a bit more
color into my skin and give it more of a
bronzey glory wow I actually love this
brush for contouring and like bronzing
out the skin
a little bit weird but I'm also going to
be running the Bruns up from one side of
my cheek across my nose to the other
side of the cheek this is just going to
give it this became more of a natural
looking Sunkist glorious in that new
excitement Sun has actually turned us
and we're not using roads up and not to
give out it's that natural rosy look I'm
going to be taking a blush this is puppy
love my makeup eight and I'm going to be
taking in the event of a planet flat top
kabuki brush just to apply this to the
apples of my cheeks
now I'm just going ahead and lightly
filling in my brows I'm going to make
them white fluffy and just very
natural-looking so that then you can
match the whole makeup look I'd rent one
in three dog and I don't want them to be
the nice day job the look I want the
skin to be
maybe on the eyes I'm going to keep you
as a very simple and fresh I'm just
going to run a soft brown shank through
the crease and the lower lash line on
this fluffy blending brush this is super
fluffy but I have a feeling it's going
to blend it really really well
and now I'm just going to go ahead and
add a few coats of mascara
I have a dream about tres Devon miles
tonight and now I'm obsessed with him
now I'm just going in with the vanity
planet fan brush and I'm just going to
be going crazy with the highlighter to
give us that really chewy look at venues
the fan brush doing the highlighter in
the longest time so I'm so excited to
see how this looks again I'm also going
to apply that highlighter on the inner
corners with this tiny little detail
Abrash and this is just going to make
the eyes look a little bit more open and
away moving on to lips I'm going to be
taking it to colour-pop ultra matte
lipsticks what a cliched Aquarius and
one in the shade Skippy the Aquarius one
is a cream finish and the scheme's one
it's a glossy finish so I started off
with Aquarius now I'm going over with
this shade skimpy which is a glossy
finish and I'm just going to take this
on at the center of my lips
and now moving on to the very last step
because I said this is a very natural
fresh place glowy makeup look I'm going
to add a few little freckles around my
nose and just to get under my eyes so
I'm taking this brush field which is
actually lit broad like in its logo or
in a package I think it's so cute
sorry I'm just going to use this to
apply some of the freckles around my
nose area so this is the finished makeup
look and my finished skincare routine I
