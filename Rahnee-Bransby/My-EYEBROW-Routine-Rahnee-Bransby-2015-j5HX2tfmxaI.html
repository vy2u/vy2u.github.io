hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel thanks so much for watching so
today I have a very very very extremely
over-the-top requested video which is my
eyebrow routine sorry I film to my
eyebrow routine today and I can go
explain to you guys enough how much I
get asked like how much fill in my
eyebrows and how like I get them done
and stuff so I finally films of this
video for y'all today and I'm very
excited because it is such a requested
video so I must have a really strong
place in my heart and I'm so stressed
with eyebrows I think literally I've
said this under video before if you have
amazing eyebrows I will literally crazy
because eyebrows are just such an
amazing thing when they're done properly
and they literally just frame your face
and make like pull a whole makeup look
together so to start off with the basics
the way I'd room and get my eye res done
is I get them threaded so your brief
description of what threading is for all
of you who don't really know the meaning
of threading or what it does or how it
is done so threading is an ancient
technique of facial hair removal which
uses a con thread that is skillfully
manipulated on the surface of the skin
to remove hair like unnecessary hair
along the face and also shape eyebrows
and throw them into place so that's kind
of just a little description of what 13
years so I do get my eyebrows threaded I
get them threaded about every two weeks
or so and if that is just one little
eyebrow hair that is just chillin up
there and just didn't get threaded away
or has grown back before the others have
I just tuck it away and then it is gone
I get them done as dubious threading if
enemy I've ever heard of that place it
is seriously of an
amazing i have been going there for
about three years now i won't say which
one I go to me just for personal reasons
and privacy and stuff but the one that I
those who is probably the best one I've
ever been to and I do not choose to get
my eyebrows done any other way I don't
like waxing or plucking them or anything
I like getting the threaded because it
is the most natural way and probably the
best way for your skin as well and it
doesn't cause irritations on the skin as
well whereas waxing can because you can
be either allergic to the West or the
wipes can burn your skin where r
threading I personally think it's a
safest way to get your eyebrows done and
put in nice change so if you guys would
finally like to see the process of
filling my eyebrows in what products and
use however them inner so on then keep
on watching and I hope you all enjoy
sorry I totally just noticed and
realized that I probably should have
gotten my eyebrows threaded and grooms
before filming this tutorial but let's
just hope there are no stray hairs or
like weird bits of hair sticking out and
it felt sorry we did not doing my
eyebrows today and doing my whole makeup
before because I always do my base and
foundation and then I do my eyebrows and
then and do my eyes but for the purpose
of this video I decided to shoot my
eyebrows at the very last step so yeah
let's get started so as you can see my
eyebrows are really like thin and they
don't have much shape to them at all
they have a lot of life sparse areas as
you can see like this kind of this goes
really thin there and like there's just
a lot of bold patches and so the product
I used to fill in my eyebrows is the
Anastasio dip brow pomade in the shade
Ormond and I am slowly running low with
this product as you can see I'm almost
hitting rock bottom but this stuff is
seriously amazing as you know everyone
always raves about it and rants about it
and the first time I
got it I kind of put it off for a while
sorry there's an airplane flying over
right now but I kind of put it off for a
while and I didn't really want to like
use it because the first time I ever did
try use it I put my brush straight in
and like dive straight in and it made my
eyebrows look like they have been done
with a sharpie pen the story when you
are using the honest answer dip brow
pomade I highly suggest using a little
bit at a time and getting used to it
before doing your full eyebrows because
it is quite hard to get used to the
product because it is so pigmented so
for the start of my eyebrows I always go
in with a spoolie now this is just the
UM nude by nature mineral brow liner um
eyebrow pen so this is the one I used to
always use to fill in my eyebrows but i
don't really like using pencils anymore
so i just use the spoolie on the end of
the pencil and i just brushed through my
brows just making sure that only brown
hair are in place and there are no stray
hairs like floating around anywhere so
just brushing those in place sorry I'm
going to using the Coastal Scents
eyebrow brush and it just looks like
this and i always recommend using a
angled brush to do this because i feel
this is so weird i'm like holding it in
my face but i always recommend using an
angled brush to do so because it gives
you more of a precise one and a thin one
is also so much better than a thick one
because you can really control how the
product applies on to the eyebrow so I
always like to start at the beginning of
my eyebrow and work my way to the tail
and I just start by shaping the bottom
of my eyebrow first and then go in with
the arch and the tail and I always leave
the inner corner to the very last step
you
you
now moving on to the inner corner of my
brow I use the leftover product that's
already on the brush I don't put any
more product on just because I want it
to look really natural and not drawn on
much at all so I like to use the least
amount of product and I just start by
brushing the brush with the leftover
product on up through my brows and this
will give it a really like natural look
and make it look kind of like give it
that fade effect where it just fades
into the brow
and now that that passed on I'm just
going to grab a little bit more product
on the brush and just line the top part
of my eyebrow just to even out the brow
bit more and give it more shade
you
oh the address have build-in I'm taking
the match perfection rimmel london
concealer in the shade ivory and this is
the only concealer i use for this step
so i end up sorry and i'm also taking
the Coastal Scents concealer brush that
looks like this so this step I literally
do it every single time I feeling my
eyebrows like I never missed a step it's
such a must for me sorry I like doing
this just because it makes my eyebrows
like up here a lot more defined and just
gives them a lot more better a lot more
better shape this brush so conceal our
answer my eyebrow like that there and
then just at the beginning of my eye
rather as well now this feels so weird
because I have I shadow on so i usually
do this way before my eye shadow is on
so then I've even just to blend out the
concealer
so I am just going ahead and studying my
eyebrows with an eyebrow gel and I
always send my eyebrows with the jail
just because it makes me stay in place
all day and I feel like using an eyebrow
gel really makes them look a lot more
natural because it really defines the
eyebrow hairs and just make the eyebrows
look like hair instead of just like
they'll be drawn on so the 1 i've been
using lately is the elf wet cloth lash
and brow clear gel mascara so obviously
i just use the eyebrow gel side and yes
so i just start to brush this through my
brows and this literally drives rock
hard so your eyebrows I'm not gonna
budge at all during the day I see but I
just start by brushing the heads up at
the front and then brushing them three
just so that you can really
you
and now that is my eyebrow routine
complete sorry I highly a hundred and
ten percent recommend diving in and
purchasing the anastasia dipbrow pomade
it is totally worth the money is just my
holy grail product I don't think I would
ever use a different eyebrow product
because her it's just heavenly
everything that's all enjoyed this video
I finally filmed it for you also and we
might find everything I showed
everything that you guys wanted to know
so yeah I will see all these funny
people very soon in my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
