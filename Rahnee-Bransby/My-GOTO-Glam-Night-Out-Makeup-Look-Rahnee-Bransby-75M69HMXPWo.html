my channel so today I have filmed my
go-to glam night out makeup look this
makeup look I've been wearing a ton
lately and every time I post I've heard
it on my snapchat and you guys request
this makeup look like crazy so I thought
I would film it for you all today I
seriously love this makeup look so much
it is definitely one of my favorites so
if you guys would like to see how to
achieve my Night Out glam makeup look
then please keep watching and let's jump
straight into it
sorry I've already gone ahead and primed
my skin with the infallible mattifying
base primer and for foundation I'm going
to be using it my Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless foundation in the
shade 220 this has been migrating
foundation for past two months now it is
seriously
one of my favorite foundations ever it
lasts so long and it is amazing
as I'm buffing this into my skin with a
zoeva 103 silk finish brush so this is
what the foundation looks like after one
that layout I do usually like to go over
with a little bit more just over my
cheek area because that is where I do
have the most like acne scars and stuff
so I like to go over those areas with a
bit more of foundation but I do believe
it is quite a full coverage foundation
it seems to cover everything perfectly
but I just like a little heavy
foundation when I go out so that's why I
like to go those areas just with a
little bit more now I'm going in with my
wire so radiant touch concealer pen and
I'm just going to be highlighting onto
my brows under my brows so oh my gosh
under my eyes down my nose on my chin
and on my forehead
if is in the shape 2.5 it is a very
highlighting concealer and it's quite
cool coverage as well which I really
like but it's very very highlighting so
once I three blends out and apply powder
and stuff it's not going to be as bright
but on a night out I really like it in
silence I'm going to blend that out with
the same tip finish brush by zoilo I
don't usually like using the same
brushes to blend out my concealer
because I feel like my foundation that's
your electronic foundations on the brush
but my Beauty Blender is upstairs and
I'm lazy and I thought things over going
up together I'm sorry I'm just gonna
make do with this brush and I could
still turns out looking okay
oh my god I should I say that my camera
wasn't doing a toll out stock right now
I'm just setting my under eyes with my
Alex and Jenkins okay no cause would be
banana shade
we set the rest on my face I'm taking a
cause my Australis freshman flawless in
the shape darkest Brown now moving on to
eyes I'm going to be taking makeup geeks
creme brulee in the crease as my
transition what is happening today as my
transition shade this is the best
transition shade I've ever used it is
seriously perfect for any skin tone so
yeah I'm just going to blend that into
the crease and now I'm going in with
makeup geeks Coco bear and this is just
like a warm chocolate brown shade and
I'm just going to blend this into the
crease and the outer V just to really
soften up the look and of course I'm
using my favorite to leave a lot of
stuff to find a brush this brush if you
don't have it you have to get your hands
on it because it is seriously what can I
explain it is the best landing brush
and now I'm just taking the shade
chickeny which is like a bright orange
yellow shade and I'm just going to blend
this to the crease just to give us more
warmth in the crease this is also going
to give a really nice transition between
the brown and the orange now for the
most exciting pot I'm going in with the
makeup geek foiled eyeshadow in the
shade at grandstands now this just looks
like a gorgeous taupey brown with paint
reflexes in it this shade is seriously
to die for
I've been obsessed with it lately so now
I'm just packing that all over the lid
focusing out on the inner half and the
middle of the lid where we haven't got
any shutter yet and I'm doing that on a
zoeva luxe smokey shader brush I go
pretty crazy with this shade I just keep
packing it on and packing it on and I
keep on going when I don't think that's
enough I just add a little bit more
and now I'm just going to lightly blend
through the crease just to make all the
lines really soft and make sure that
there are no harsh lines it's going to
softly blend in that dark brown shade
into the formal - letter just to us a
nice transition just so that they're
really nicely blended in together
and I'm going to take the shade croaker
bear and just apply it on the outer V of
the lower lash line I'm not going to
take it any further
in then halfway because I'm going to
apply grandstand on the inner corner and
now before we apply falsies I'm going to
be creating my lashes with the T V 3G
magic lash mascara
thankfully applying lashes I'm pretty
sure these one zombie red cherry
whiskey's I really wanted to apply my
Adele wispy lashes but I seem to
misplace limb I can't remember where
I've taken them off and put them so
these are just the red cherry whiskeys
I'm pretty sure now I applied these ages
berry when I wasn't good at flying
lashes and I cut them really thin sorry
I'm pretty sure that wearing my suit on
the outer corner but I'll just have to
work with it but Basil's are any one's
very similar to my Adele whiskies but I
usually use a cute thing but I usually
use my outer whiskey's on
and now I'm going to contour with my
cooler benefit bronzer I haven't used
this bronzer in so many months and I
don't know why I stopped using it
because now I've just realized how
amazing it is again you know when you
like stop using a product and then you
use it again you're like oh my god yes
why did I ever stop using this because
this is like seriously one of my
favorite bronzer and on a night out I
definitely love my strong contour sorry
I'm going to be contouring the hell out
of my cheekbones
I'll say I just remembered a lot of
people ask me what brush this is it is
the um I don't exactly know the name but
it's from Nigeria and it's the contour
and highlight brush it came with their
contour kit and it's seriously my
favourite contouring brush navigli I'm
going to be taking my models prefer
mineralized soft touch of blush and I'm
going to be taking these three shades
here which is soft focus and cool bronze
and I'm going to be applying this
through my cheeks now this is just like
a gorgeous glowing bronze blush pretty
much and this just gives the most
amazing look to the skin and after your
highlight I'm taking my chichi bronze of
war shimmer brick and I'm just going to
be really intensely highlighting the
high points of my face sorry I'm just
taking a mixture of all the shades and
just going to be applying this to my
cheekbones
my nose my Cupid's bow in my forehead
everywhere
and now I'm going to be taking a makeup
geek sorry I and I'm just going to be
highlighting the inner corners of my
eyes and I'm going in with deals
lipliner in the shade of five one three
linen I'm just going to be lining my
lips and I'm also going to be filling in
my lips with the lip liner as well and
I'm going in with a matte lipstick in
the top and I'm just going to lightly
apply this over the lip liner just very
softly because I don't want it to defeat
the purpose of the brown because this is
more of a reddish tone top and then this
is my completed go to clown makeup look
