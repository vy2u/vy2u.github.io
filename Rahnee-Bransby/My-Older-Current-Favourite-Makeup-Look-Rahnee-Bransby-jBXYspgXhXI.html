so sorry about how my hand looks it

camera looks really bad for some reason
I had a bad effect on experience I guess
um I'm not too sure how that happened I
can't I grabbed the bottle and 1/2 X hat
on but now it looks orange so please
ignore that because I have no idea
what's going on with this right now
this one looks normal kind of what the
hell why do my hands look like orange in
person they don't even look like that oh
hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel thank you so much for watching
in today's video I films this makeup
look for you all and this is my favorite
current makeup look at the moment a few
people have asked me in my recent
Instagram so words and my Brisbane vlog
which only sat right here if you haven't
seen it what makeup look I've been
wearing and this is the look I've been
leaning towards today I featured the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette and this is
my current favorite makeup palette at
the moment I think it's freaking
stunning all these shades in up up
gorgeous so I use all my eyes today and
if you don't have this I recommend going
buying it because it is amazing it's
like my life's a bell so if you'd like
to see how to achieve my current
favorite makeup look then please keep
watching and let's jump straight into it
sorry starting off with a clean face I'm
taking at the lasting finish of primer
and I'm just dotting this all over my
face and now the look is complete just
drinking I'm using my fingers to blend
that all in now that the primers on
we're moving right on to foundation so
I'm using the lumi magique foundation in
the shade and for pure beige and I'm
just working this into my skin with a
Real Techniques expert face brush and
I'm also working this down my neck as I
have a fake channel at the moment and I
my whole face to match as well as my
neck so
now I'm going to be concealing and
highlighting with instant age rewind
dark circle eraser so I'm just applying
this under my eyes down the bridge of my
nose on my forehead and on my chin and
then we're just blending everything out
now to set my whole face I am taking a
big floppy brush and the Australis fresh
and flawless pressed powder in the shade
darkest Brown and just applying this all
over my face and also down my neck as
well
now I'm going to be contouring with my
favorite product at the moment this is
the master Tino bronzer sorry I'm just
contouring my cheekbones my jawline my
temples and of course you guys guessed
it my nose
now moving on to eyebrows I thought I'd
chuck in some footage of me filming my
eyebrows because I thought this would
bore you guys but a lot of people ask me
how I fill in my eyebrows so I'm using
the nude by Nature mineral brow liner as
I was cord it's on the screen somewhere
in the shade brunette and I'm just
filling in those bad boys and then I'm
just setting my eyebrows with a clear
brow gel and now moving right on to your
eyes I'm taking the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette and I'm taking the shade at
champagne truffle and just highlighting
it my brow bone with this shade now I'm
taking the shade salted caramel and I'm
just working that into my crease as a
transition shade and can I just say this
chocolate bar palette smells exactly
like chocolate like every time I use it
it makes me wanna eat it it smells so
good and now I'm taking a new shade of
marzipan and I am just packing that all
over my lids and this is a gorgeous like
Co pink kind of shade I'm obsessed with
it it's one of my favorite shades in the
palette and then I'm just going ahead
and blending everything out so that
there are no harsh lines and then I'm
taking that same shade marzipan and just
applying it into my inner corner to
highlights then I'm taking at the shade
at triple fudge and I'm just applying
this onto my outer corners and blending
it through and this is the shape that
actually bought me like this is the
shade that made me buy the palette I
don't know why I kind of random but I
really do like this shade
and then I'm just going back in with
these shady dat marzipan and just
packing out onto my lids because it kind
of came up when I was blending
everything at 3:00 and now going back in
with the shade at triple fudge I am just
blending that along my lower lash line
just to smoke things up a little bit and
now to put some lashes on to my bold
eyes I'm taking the I love extreme
volume Express no crazy volume express
mascara by essence and the colossal
volume express mascara I'm just coating
my top and lower lashes with a few coats
of these
and now I'm just adding some color into
my face so I'm taking the NYX blush in
the shade Pete I always mix up my words
to send and I'm just applying is true at
my cheeks and now we're beyond to
highlighting the high points of my face
I'm taking mary-lou manizer by the balm
and just highlighting my face
and last but not least I'm taking the
matte lipstick in the shade at velvet
teddy and just applying this onto my
lips and then we're done whew
so I hope you guys all enjoyed this
video if you did please give it a
massive thumbs up and subscribe because
it means the world to me and I will see
all you beautiful people very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
