my channel so today i have a new years
eve makeup tutorial for you all and when
i think of you dizzy I think very start
and glamorous and love to make up a very
fierce great intense so today I come up
with this super glamorous dark black
smokey eye there's actually a black
glittery smokey eye but I don't think
I've actually picked up the glitter on
the lid which is super annoying I hope
you guys to see ya I'm not too sure if
you can but keep in mind i did use a
black glitter on the moon so today's
video is actually super fun because it
is in collaboration with my good friend
make up my mind for pinch here on
youtube his makeup skills are
unbelievable they literally kill me like
how is someone that good at makeup i
have no idea we have broke down a very
similar makeup looks we've both gone for
the smokey eye with a new leaf I've done
a black smokey eye with a nude lip and
he has done a really gorgeous vibrant
purple smokey eye of the day nearly so I
will leave all these links below be sure
to go check out his video and send him
some love I'm going to stop rambling on
now and let's jump right into it
starting with eyes I'm taking makeup
geeks creme brulee and I'm just going to
be working this into the crease as my
transition shade and now going in with
the shade bitten from makeup geek I'm
just lending this directly into the
crease and this is going to be our
crease shade now as you can see i do
blend is quite high into the crease
because i want it to be really smoky and
intense and i don't want the black to
kind of like draw attention away from
this shade so I'm landing this quite
high into the crease and then just
making it really smoky and I'm going to
just keep blending this shade on until I
have it the darkness that I would like
and now going in with a shade craft on a
Mac 219 brush I'm just going to blend
this directly into the crease now as you
can see i'm focusing it into the crease
report packing it on my lid this just
allows for an easier transition and i
highly recommend doing this if you're
new to smokey eyes or if you have
trouble with them
it just allows you to blend it a lot
easier and have it more control over the
color and yes so you're just blending
that into the crease and then later
we're going to go over and pack it on
Alan and now taking the shade corrupt
and parking this all over my lid I'm
doing this with a 2 3 4 lugs smokey
shader brush I definitely recommend
zoeva brushes for oh sorry this brushes
from silly forgot to mention that I
definitely recommend that we brushes
when parking shades onto the lid I just
find it makes a shade a lot more
pigmented and they're sorry easy to
apply the eyeshadow because the shadow
doesn't get stuck in the brush and I
just absolutely love it so I'm just
going to keep going over and packing
this on until I have it the darkness
that I wanted and I wanted mine really
really black so I packed on quite a lot
but if you aren't comfortable with
having it so dark you can turn it down a
little bit and then just going through
with that 227 lot softer finer brush
that I use to blend bitten through the
crease again and I'm blending the shade
bitten through the crease once again and
this actually made an awesome transition
it kind of made like a purpley tore into
the log I don't know it kind of gave
like a purple effect which I really like
so yeah
now going in with the Lancome I actually
don't know how to pronounce this I sale
and chrome but i'm pretty sure it's long
calm anyway going in with that eyeshadow
i'm not even going to try pronounce the
eyeshadow name because i'm going to
butcher it so hard so this is just a
black glitter and i'm just packing this
all over my lid and making the lid a lot
more dark heart and adding a bit of
glitter to it by wish the glitter was
more intense it wasn't as intense of
that as i would like it to be so you can
totally swap it out for something else
but yeah and i'm blending through the
crease once again with the shave bitten
for the very last time i highly
recommend blending blending and blending
with this makeup look because it is so
dark everyone it's the extra smoky so
yeah just blend your little card out now
taking your makeup wipe and cleaning out
all the fallout because they were there
was had a lot of fallout from the black
eyeshadow and i'm taking the ardell demi
with the eyelashes and just popping
these on these eyelashes are absolutely
amazing i highly recommend them for new
years or any special occasions they are
so awesome and fluttery and flirty and i
just love them they're so gorgeous all
the RDL lashes are amazing so yeah
and are going in with the l'oreal true
match foundation in the shade natural
beige ivory my man i'm just going to be
buffing this over my skin with a BH
Cosmetics flat top kabuki brush and be
sure to blend is down your neck as well
as you want it to match your neck now
going in with the Rimmel London wake me
up concealer in the shade ivory I'm just
popping this under my eyes down the
bridge of my nose on my chin and on my
forehead to highlight and I'm going to
be blending this in with a zoeva 10
through silk finish brush and now taking
my Alison Jade contour palette i'm
taking the banana shade in the palette
and just setting the places i
highlighted and this is my favorite
product ever i seriously recommend
getting your hands on it is seriously
amazing and i'm just setting the rest of
the face with my Rimmel London's stay
matte translucent powder time for my
favorite part I'm going to be contouring
with the natio contour palette and I'm
doing a theist strong intense contour
because I love my strong intense contour
and its new year so we can go all out so
I'm just contouring my cheekbones my
jawline my nose and my uncles
and to give us that bronze a bombshell
look I'm taking my Rimmel London natural
bronzer bronzer and I'm just applying
this on to my cheeks and also in my
temples just to bronze up the face and
give us that sunkissed glow and now
going back in with the shade carafes I'm
just applying this along my lower lash
line and this is just going to give a
really dark intense look I feel like I
like it saying about this eye makeup
look is that it's dark and intense but
yes we're just smudging this along my
lower lash line and then I'm going back
into the shade bitten and I'm going to
blend it out with the shade bitten and
this is just going to give a really
pretty transition
now I'm just taking a wot of white and
my color wines now I'm just taking a
black eyeliner pencil and running that
along my lower lash line and carding my
lower lashes with a few coats of mascara
and now I'm going in with the gorgeous
shade shimmer shimmer from a cupcake and
just highlighting my brow bone and my
energy adult
and now I'm going all out with the
highlighter so I'm taking the max soft
and gentle and just highlighting all the
high points of my face so my cheekbones
my nose my Cupid's bow above my brow
bone and my forehead just going crazy
and I'm going to do this really intense
so we're going to be like a glowing
disco ball now for the very last step
for loose I'm taking the chichi lip
liner in the shade at centerfolds and
just lining my lips and then going over
that with the chichi lipstick in the
shade at calendar go and then that is
