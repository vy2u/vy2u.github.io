have 18 years of lookbook slash outfit
video for you all and this is actually a
super exciting video because it's a
collaboration with my beautiful friend
Katie also known as still the spotlight
here on YouTube so we have teamed up to
bring you eight different outfits for
entering the new year so be sure to
check out the link below for Katie's
video and subscribe to her channel
because she is so amazing and let's jump
into it so he's starting things off
super casual I thought I'd give you guys
two casual and two more dressy outfit
today so this first one I've got is a
black and white pant strap effect
jumpsuit and I've just paired it with
some gladiator flats and I've also
thrown on some Sonny's from Oscar Wylie
as if you wanted to dress this outfit up
you can't early throw on your favorite
pair of heels match it with a clutch and
you're good to go so for my second
outfit we're still keeping it super
casual so I've gone for this really cute
black crop and I paired it with a rose
print skirt and keeping it easy for you
guys I just kept on the same at
gladiator flats and thrown on my
favorite vintage sunglasses and that is
the second outfit done and dusted now
this is the fun part where we start to
get dressed up I'm sure everyone loves
their monochrome clothing so I've gone
with there's a black and white striped
crop which has a low front and for this
outfit outfit outfit I've paired it with
some roots jeans which kind of give that
like cool edgy vibe to the look and to
keep it dressy I've thrown on these
amazing tire pills which I picked up
from a hunter store so we're already off
TV very last outfit I have for y'all
today
so this one is super girly and fun so
I've gone put this off-the-shoulder
white crop top and I paired it with
these awesome shorts that have an
attached skirt around the bag so it's
kind of like a score in a way and I've
also added a belt to break up the white
top in the white shorts and kept on the
same shoes from hunters
sorry I would love to know which app it
was your favorite
