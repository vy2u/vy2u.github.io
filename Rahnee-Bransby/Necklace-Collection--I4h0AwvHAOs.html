the other day actually Felix going to
rise the other day because I felt like
my background was true dog because my
windows says so it doesn't really
reflect the light on to me or like my
background it kind of inner like so into
this side so I bought one of you it's
going to fun to ride and today I got
around to setting it up oh my god it was
the hardest thing I've ever done in my
life
and it should have only taken these few
minutes I had to push the globe into
like this soft box to make the globe go
in and I'm sitting there for about half
an hour getting so frustrated and angry
texting shining like how the hell do you
do this and then I realized you just
have to push it in I was trying to get
that like in that soft box for about
half an hour and all you have to do is
push it in because it is one of our bad
ones you have to put a bag on the end we
don't have to but just wait wait out
probably and I think it's will exchange
or something in the end of the back I
don't have Center so I could see your
cans in that in my bag and I have two
jerry cans hanging right there but
anyway I was this close to giving up and
I'm sorry happy I did it because to look
at the difference it makes this is what
on and this is what off anyway that's my
eventful morning right there
less than web but don't ever give up on
your dreams because you'll succeed
eventually hey guys it's Ronnie and

super excited for today's video because
I was sitting down and I was like what

much necklaces so today I'm going to be
filming my neck place collection for you
