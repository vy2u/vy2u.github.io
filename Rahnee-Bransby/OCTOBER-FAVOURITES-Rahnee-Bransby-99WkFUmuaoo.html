so I'm going to quickly start out by
pointing out the obvious I have a new
background I just quickly threw this one
together this morning because my old
background I was just hating I really
didn't like it and I was so
uncomfortable to feel so this is only
temporary for now but if you guys liked
it let me know and I might just keep it
like this for a while yeah let me know
if you guys have any suggestions what do
you think I should put on a table or if
I should add lights or anything that
would be awesome so today I am filming
my October favorites now as every
youtuber says this year is going so
crazy fast and it is ridiculous is
almost Christmas that scares the living
hell out lights on me living daylights
out of me it is so weird
yes so if you'd like to see what I've
been loving this month please keep
watching and let's jump straight into it
so this favorite is nowhere near
possible to hold up a show for you guys
because it is huge so once you see what
it is I'm not gonna be like here's my
next favorite I mean for a lot of people
like me on snapchat you would definitely
know what I'm talking about because I
just been posting about it so incredibly
much so my favorite favorite favorite
thing for this month is my car don't
anything close I can show you you guys
is my car key so a few days ago I got my
license and I picked up my first car
ever and yes I did pay for this whole
thing myself just in case any of you
were wondering I saved up for such a
long time but this is seriously like the
car I've wanted for so long so it is a
master three in dark grey I love the
color so much it is so easy to drive
I've been wanting this car for so long
so the fact that I can actually drive it
now and it's my dream car is just insane
to me it was a bit pricey but I was
happy to spend as much money on the car
that I wanted because I was just sorry
like I'm gonna be driving that call for
five years or sorry I'm not gonna be
getting anyone anytime soon and I
absolutely love it like it's just the
best car to drive and having a license
is the best thing about it seriously
makes me so happy I can do anything I
want I don't have to ask my parents I
don't have to get my boyfriend to run
around for me I can just go wherever
when I want and it's just the best thing
ever so yeah now I'm going to jump on
into the makeup and beauty things that
I've been loving in October my first
beauty product I have to share with you
guys
Allisyn Jade powder contour kit in lives
now Alison J actually does my eyebrows
she is amazing at eyebrows I used to get
them threaded and she said it was so bad
for you so I'm so glad I stopped so yeah
I'm going to be getting my eyebrows too
feathers had it on but for the time
being I can't because he helps me Tory
value chain which it's different going
but my birthday's in like two months so
I gotta go so fast so well as that she
gave me her contour kit to try out and
guys this is beyond what it's like this
is the best console kit I've ever tried
in my life
number one reason why I say that is
because first of all it has a mirror and
this mirror is huge so I use this to do
my makeup in every single day the fact
that that just has a mirror makes me so
happy because I'm pretty sure every
single other contour kit doesn't have a
mirror I can roll be parents uh and
second of all you can refill the Pens if
you run out I know that when I was using
the a seat onto a contour kit I was only
using the banana paddle and I would
literally buy and you brought a new
palette just with that color but because
I didn't like any of the other colors
but thing with this palette I absolutely
loved is I have used every single shade
in this palette and they are all so
amazing
I find the powders in this really fun I
don't even know how to explain it
they're like really fun and easy to
apply like this so fine but they have
such good coverage whereas the AC on to
a console kit I find the paths are
really like thick if that makes sense
like when I pack it onto my eyes it just
looks like I packed so much on when I
have it and it does get kind of like
crazy and I don't even know how to
explain it this is just amazing I was
sorry not to it on the skin even if you
like it double it up I did wear this the
other day and I put makeup on in the
morning and applied it to my skin like
the contour and the highlighting shades
and then that night I was going on so I
touched it off and it didn't even look
cakey like it just looks like a fresh
lay up and the thing I love about this
is I can actually use the bronze shades
because in my AC on to a contour kit I
can't say I probably sucked that like
five times down I never used the
contouring shades because they were just
so harsh and the coloring just wasn't
right so I never touched them but I
absolutely love these days so like easy
to use not harsh at all I have it on
today and I just love how it contours
it's so now
so I use these two to contour and I use
this one as a blush which absolutely
love because it gives such like a
sunkissed gorgeous bronze glow and then
I use the highlighter to highlight and
this highlight is absolutely amazing
this is one of my absolute favorites
contour kits I've ever tried in my life
and probably my favorite beauty product
I'll box over the next beauty products I
want to share with you guys are for
makeup brushes the first one I'm going
to talk about is an Allison J brush
because we're just on the topic of her
stay Alton actually specializes in
eyebrows so she does like eyebrows
routine waxing feathers tattoos
everything and she contacted me and
asked me if I wanted to come in and her
to just work her magic on my eyebrows
and I'm so glad she did because she
literally saved me my eyebrows were
turning into such a mess like I just got
to the point where I hated them and I
used to love doing my eyebrows that used
to feel so comfortable with them and
yeah I was at a point where I just
absolutely hated them and she gave me
one of these brushes which is gonna
spoolie on one end and the eyebrow brush
on the other ends now this eyebrow brush
is the softest and thinnest and easiest
brush to use I've ever used in my life
it applies to so well it is so like
precise because the brush is so small
and petite it is just very easy to fill
in your eyebrows and it gives you such a
nice like sharp straight line like the
one I was using before was quite jagged
so like I would have to really focus and
might be like oh I don't know it's this
making sense but the brush I was using
before was quite jagged so when I was
filling my eyebrows it was really hard
to get such like a perfect straight line
where's this is sorry easy to use and
I've also spoolie it also comes in good
use as well the next wash I have to
share with you guys is a zoeva luxe
cheek finish brush now this is usually
used as a blush brush but I don't use
this for blush I use it to contour I
just find this brush is so amazing to
use for contouring because it is so thin
and like too small and it has the
perfect shape at the tip to contour so
soft and easy to blend out with and I
just absolutely have been loving this
lately to contour because I was actually
struggling for a while I didn't have a
contour brush but so long and my contour
was looking really dodgy and I just
didn't like it and then it has this and
I never used it it was just talking my
brush collection for so long and I was
like this looks like a good contour
brush I'm gonna try it out and I have
and I have been absolutely loving it
since it is also so easy to contour the
jaw line and also the noise as well when
I'm in a rush and I just wanna quickly
contour my nose it is so good for that
so yes and it's a pretty color as well
the next rush I also use to contour it
is the Sigma 3d precision brush this
brush is so awesome to contour my nose
I've absolutely been obsessed with this
brush to contour my nose with if you
have ever seen this the brushes are
great to a point and has a really fine
point at the end so I find it really
easy to contour my nose and also blend
out with that and the very last brush I
have to share with you guys I'm so sorry
I'm talking so much about brushes right
now but the very last brush I have to
share with you guys is a zoeva lots soft
luxe soft definer brush she's it's a two
to seven one I love love love using this
to blend out a shadow and blend a shadow
into my crease am I out of me it is the
softest brush I've ever felt in my life
it is so easy to use it just blends out
amazingly and applies actually amazingly
and I just absolutely love using this I
use this every single day like every
single day without a doubt I will use
this brush speaking of eyes and eye
shadow my next favorite is an eyeshadow
from makeup geek now this is the makeup
geek eyeshadow in the shade
now I'm sure many of you all know that
lately I have been loving wearing the
color orange especially now that we're
in spring in Australia and orange is my
favorite color Styles like let's just
rock it every single day in my life
so this puppy actually is like I really
but orange with like a red undertone
I absolutely adore it I wear it every
single day almost I love wearing it just
in the crease I'm wearing it today if
you can see I just love wearing it in
the out of 82
Brian on my eyes and I really think
orange works well with my complexion and
my brown eyes so yeah I have one is
every single day without is out and
speaking of orange the next thing I
should share with you guys is something
you all will be able to guess pause this
video and comment below if you can guess
it and let's see if you can get it right
because I a hundred times I guarantee
you guarantee you will get it right so
this favorite of course is an orange
liquid lipstick I have been wearing this
almost every single day in the month of
October and November so far I am about 4
to 5 or
liquid lipsticks which are all pretty
much the same I don't know why I have so
many I just gone crazy with them lately
but my favorite one out of all of them
will have to be the Australis fuller
lips matte lip cream in the shade oh my
god oh my god I just realized I've been
telling everyone this liquid lipstick is
in the shade Ryoji it's actually in the
shade San Francisco oops sorry hard not
to wear this in today's video I wanted
to wear so bad but I was like I have to
step away from the orange for a while
because I'm just wearing every single
day but I'm going off too so I'm gonna
chop this one now that it's getting
really hot in Australia
I don't mind very much face makeup
especially eye makeup I like just I like
to just wear a tiny bit of mascara so I
think this totally makes up for it and
if you put a pop of color on your lips
it totally just makes your makeup look
look like you put so much more effort
into it
everyone asking which it is it is San
Francisco I'm sorry for telling everyone
the wrong one so yeah my things are
broke by the brand Dermalogica so the
first one I have is the Cleo Scott a
break at clearing emergency spot fits
now my skin has been breaking out a
little bit more than usual lately just
because I've been traveling a lot and
when I fly my skin gets really like this
link in the air that doesn't like my
skin or my body because whenever I fly I
get so sick and my skin breaks out like
crazy so I have been using this lately
and it absolutely has saved my soul like
I just put this on after I cleanse and
turn and before I moisturize on any
spots or pimples that I have coming off
and the next morning they are like they
have gone down or they had completely
gone it is so crazy so this works
amazing and the next one I have is the
clear start breakout clearing overnight
treatment so I cleanse exfoliate and
turn of course I apply this bad boy and
then I go in with this and this is just
an amazing moisturizer that really um
reduces redness Wow reduces redness um
stops breakouts and just clears the skin
and gives it a healthy glow so yeah
thumbs up for these too and also the
packaging is so cute I love the
packaging so much so the next three
favorites I have to share with you guys
are fashion favorites so Iran is a
favorite video isn't a favorite video by
me
if I don't show you guys a pair of shoes
well I should technically say
appropriate it's because I sho show you
guys a pair of boots in every single
favorite videos so this one they have a
new favorite pair of boots they are just
a ankle cut brute which have like a
leather look to them they're not leather
but they look like leather so yeah I
have been absolutely loving these I have
pretty much trash them they have got so
many scratches over them because I wore
them every single day in Sydney these
are the comfiest boots I have ever worn
in my life and they are my favorite at
the moment they kind of remind me of Doc
Monson work boots because they have a
little tag at the back and they like
it's not like a lofty the elastic part
on the side I have no idea but I love
these because they are ankle boots and
they don't make my legs buddy it's
that's cute
they also from general pants and by the
brand urge if any of you guys are
wondering am I very last favorite of the
month of October that I have to share
with you guys are a pair of overalls
I've been loving overalls so much lately
because they're so easy to tuck on in
summer and so breezy and comfortable so
I pick these up from a vintage store in
Sydney and these are only fifty dollars
which are a bargain to me because
overalls can be so expensive they can
seriously range from like $100 to $300
the thing I love about these is the
color because they just like a light
wash blue and I just absolutely adore
them so when I found them I tried them
on and they were actually past my knees
but they were rolled up and they just
looked ridiculous like they looked so
big and I was like you know I love these
so much I'm just gonna buy them and cut
them and hope for the best that they
would look good so I cut and break the
bottom of them and they actually looked
so cool on they are like my favorite
overalls ever they're just adorable and
they're like your typical overall and
when I think of overalls I think of
these so I think that is all the
favorites I have to share with you guys
today I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and be sure to give it a
thumbs up to let me know to film more
favorites in the future I'm aiming to
film one every single month but
