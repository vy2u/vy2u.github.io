back to my channel thank you so much for
watching so today I have films a
question and answer video with my
amazing beautiful friend Sammy Robinson
I'm sure many of you guys know who she
is so we took to my snapchat and asked
you guys to send us questions and we
answered them in today's video and yes
so if you guys would like to see us talk
about right on topics and writing
questions then please keep watching and
let's jump straight into it and also one
quick last scene um
if any of us can tell I'm a little bit
sick at the moment either sore throat so
just ignore what's coming out of here
because it doesn't sound very polite of
the same I'm a little bit Curt I'm
croaky as well so for a little bit you
freaky how did we meet and what was your
lies we clicked yeah yeah so we actually
surprisingly a lot of people who think
we met like just recently but me and
Sammi have known each other for so many
years like no four years we just
followed each other against Graham and
had each other I remember no I remember
II recessing she added me on Facebook
and then she popped up she she was
someone that I thought I knew but she
wasn't yeah and she popped up to me and
you said something like you're so pretty
yes and um I still turn I was like well
I actually had no idea who this girl was
I thought I thought I knew her and I was
like she's her as well I'm sorry
we wouldn't so yeah I would have
probably been like you're 15 16 years
old you know
oh god knows 14 probably they're
probably yeah and then and then we
stopped like we talked for a while and
we stopped talking for like three years
or something and then we found each
other an Instagram yeah so we followed
each other on that and then like you
know you just talk on an off comment on
each other's picture occasionally and
then I started my youtube channel and I
popped
to her because I found hers and I asked
her just sort of like what the hell do I
do it's not happy how do i how do I do
anything oh yeah
and yeah so she helped me heaps at that
and that sort of is what brought us
closer and then we decided to go up so
we collapsed and then I texted Sammy and
I was like hey I'm going to be in Sydney
in like three weeks when I got chopped
yeah I guess like yeah there wasn't
really anything that made us like click
oh blonds yeah and it wasn't anything
that made me go oh my god I'm gonna
click with this girl you just might just
kind of like we had so much in common
everything we just talked about yeah
like it wasn't when we first met it
wasn't awkward and we were like oh my
god were to me so you have mutual
interests
yeah we're not we have so many things
similar in our lives
yeah like YouTube everything it's just
we actually clicked so much better than
I ever expected like I didn't think we
would be as close as we are so it's
crazy and one thing I'll always remember
is I comments I don't want to say media
photos on Instagram like a year ago
oh my god I love your top where's it
from she did freaking reply delivers I
thought nothing I'm really bad with my
Instagram comments
oh yeah I'm yeah another wife for some
reason on Instagram I just got a reply
so the next question is what color you
rang on your lips and I think this is
very important because we might get a
few comments sorry I'm wearing the
Rimmel London apocalypse luke black our
team at one in orange ology I'm wearing
a lime chrome Velveteen in Salem and
we're both wearing each other's lip
colors yeah that's mine this is and
that's her special was that my voice
your thoughts on Athena O'Neill quitting
social media it's kind of like because
we're on social media so we kind of
already get an idea of what the
background of social media is yeah I
just don't like it's it's not I don't
find social media a lie I mean like it
depends everyone can take social media
different it's not a lie because
everyone knows that people are promoting
things anyway like if I'm tagging
something in my Instagram it's not as if
people are shocked to find out that
that's a promotion like everyone already
knew that it's not new
just find it a little bit ridiculous how
she's come out saying she wants to quit
this dream life because it's fake to me
I will go on my phone for three seconds
post on Instagram I don't have
notifications on my Instagram so I'm not
sitting there like lying through it like
a crazy person I'll post an Instagram
and then I'll happily still catch up
with my friends be surrounded by my
family I walked away she has perceived
us to be on social media is absolutely
ridiculous because if I was to be on
social media or not I would still have
exactly the same friends that I had like
I would be surrounded by my family I'm
so close with my family I find it so
offensive that she would pinhole us as
all the same things we're all insecure
we're all depressed
no way yeah I don't let my social media
to find me at all I see no or center
however you pronounce on all issues of
her own but she has to start accepting
the fact that this is a completely
individual response because I don't feel
the way that she feels she's not
actually living real life if you live
really life and wake up go to your job
get money to pay your rent and do
exactly like yeah I think is that a
normal you're not you're not living in a
new age because you can go take a book
to the beach with pillows and listen
watch the Samuraizer listen to the
nature that's actually not what real
life is and if everyone did that oh what
is I find it I find her a bit extreme
and I find the things she's saying a bit
hypocritical and also contradicting is
that everything she says doesn't exactly
match up and it doesn't exactly make
sense all the things she's saying and
there is one video in particular that
not many people would have seen Alice
you've gone on her actual website but
she is saying that she's quitting social
media and it like she's not going to
post on social media anymore and stuff
which she is still technically doing
she's but she posted one saying i sat at
my computer screen and just watch all
these people flood in and like message
me on my for forum or shelter but she's
still behind her computer screen
talking to these people on social media
she's interacting with people
why didn't that bother waiting it yeah
she goes she's never felt more alive
because she can talk to people without
having to be have comments and likes and
followers it's just people speaking on a
forum but then she's contradicting
herself she's saying she's she wants to
get off that's great she wants get off
social media she wants to get it she was
get away from being behind the screen
we've somehow finds questions so
interesting so it is what shapes what
shaped heads do we have I don't find it
interesting but I I have round and it's
a it's quite prominent because next to
her she's got she's quite another long
she's got a really over long face and
I've got a really over round face so
next to each other I look especially
round and quite big and she looks extra
long speakers were completely different
so yeah long rounds I'm sorry if we want
a youtuber what we do after school I
would probably do be doing exactly what
I'm doing as well I would stay at I
would go to uni and I would also
probably get a job so I'm working in a
pub and I am at uni so I guess I'd want
to be in PR after my degree
well I just finished school last
Monday's so honestly I have no idea what
I would be doing I guess whatever comes
comes but I will want to do something
with special effects and makeup and
white doing makeup for like movies and
TV shows and stuff so something around
that but honestly I have no idea so the
question is what do we look for in a guy
and how do we get over a guy well I'm in
a relationship and I never had to get
got I've never had to get over guys so
somebody would help you with this one
but what I look for in a guys like
really hilarious like amazing
very loving very confident yes just I
looked for the same thing so I look for
just a great personality someone that
makes you laugh because you want to be
around someone that makes you happy
um I also personally always look for
someone that's quite talks and that's
just like always it was something that I
look for charming traits you well great
personality funny yeah things like that
um and someone who can talk to parents I
think is so yeah yeah just a gentleman
how to get over a guy um gosh everyone
can do it so differently everyone has
different coping mechanisms
I guess when recently I've had to try
and get over a guy I have just
surrounded myself back with my friends
yeah I like distracting yourself yeah
make sure you stay so busy because if
you're sitting down thinking about it
24/7 if you're feeling sorry for
yourself then it's only just gonna get
worse and that's all you're gonna have
on your mind like 24/7 so do I think
about it and do not stop them yeah make
sure make sure you're not and especially
don't stop them if they've moved on yeah
that'll make you feel worse yeah so the
question was what are your thoughts in a
relationship between the ages of 16 and
19 uh you don't need to be in one it's
basically a my thoughts I I guess when I
was 16 thought all I needed to do is
look for a boy look for a boy make sure
I have a boy in my life but you
ultimately do not need a boyfriend and
you're still growing up while you're
going through your teenage years yeah
it's so much fun just to like go out and
party like obviously I met my boyfriend
when I was we met when I was 15 but you
do know each other yeah like if you meet
a boy and the boyfriend at school I go
out without Emily but don't feel like
you need a boyfriend and sorry yeah if
your friends have boyfriends and you
don't have a boyfriend don't feel like
you need one just to get in because
chances are they might get freaked over
and you want yeah yeah they might be
and you won't have to go through it out
okay so the question is what is your
favorite makeup look on a celebrity of
all-time
now Sammy's my favorite is Gigi Hadid
VMAs like golden golden ones in one
because yeah I just love golden makeup
looks and mine is I really have a
specific suspicious I can't thing so
it's just to see specific specific
specific okay edit that word yes I don't
have an actual makeup look on a
celebrity that I really like but I
really love when Kim Kardashian goes
full on full conce or full bronze glowy
fresh makeup look I think is our
graduates with a bright lip like my
recent Kim Kardashian is that makeup
look I love that so much yes like thank
