the bigger the troop the bigger the hoe
because holy crap they are on another
level
hey guys it's Ronnie and welcome back to
my channel so today I'm getting super
cozy with you guys I'm sitting on my bed
and I'm wearing a sweater I just got
this by the way it's so cute I think
this would look so cute with like white
pants and then like white flies and like
why it's on is we're getting off topic
this video is none of that fashion but
hey I decided to sit down and film a
reaction to old Friday's video so I
asked you guys to screenshot and
snapchat if you want to me to fill one
of these videos and you've got over
2,000 screenshots I can honestly say I
changed so much ugly human being and I'm
so thankful for that because some of
these are absolute shockers so I have my
USB in my laptop with all my old photos
on I've been through a few of them I
haven't seen them all so we're just
going to go through them together and
I'm a little bit nervous I feel of my
eyes with hearing which have been like
holy crap what about me we're going to
take a little trip down memory lane and
I'm going to start off by showing you
guys some really really old photos of me
I think I was about 12 in these photos
and then we'll move on to when I got
into high school and I was a teenager
and I try to dress myself I try to have
a good fashion I guess absolutely first
photo that I see because of the effects
on it please sepia lon I was obsessed to
die I think I've gained like all my
photos I was like a husband tidge I've
ever taken it started with a stumble
setting so like the Sun coming through
my window and I was like oh my god
perfect opportunity to get a model shot
so this is what I came up with I looks
like sad I I don't need to look serious
I'm like wait this is the one I took
this order and I was like I am a module
actor but I look sad at the same time so
I'm like
oh I actually think I was so acute in
this order I mean I don't know what the
smile was doing but I look happy
oh my god I kind of owe in that murders
I don't know what was wrong with my
smile when I was little but whenever I
smiled I looked sad
this was my final feature on everything
like MSN MySpace is that all we have
ever said am i safe or my god what is
that probably the most entrancing photo
I would ever share with you guys but
first of all what am I wearing like that
necklace I was actually set to that
necklace it was one of the long ones and
I had like lightning bolts and like
little checkered balls on our second of
all the face I'm like I can pitch myself
in my head at the side being light on my
blood added colors so good in this photo
and how me just acknowledge the fact
that I'm doing this in a clothing store
imagine the people around I'm sitting
there taking my photo load thank you for
problem shoot yourself
I remember this was my last day of
primary school and I was like I have to
get a selfie so memories this is the one
that I feel good I mean my skin looks
incredible I wish I'd never started
wearing my car honestly you're lying to
yourself if you say that you never went
to the shop and went for the clothes
section and put all the clothes on or
went to the toy section and to produce
with every single toy that there was my
weekends was best going to the shops for
the two thinking photos in like Kmart or
BW or like with all the toys and all the
clothes now I want to share with you
guys almost humbler Day photos so this
is where my someone started to keep up
and I saw this gained followers
honestly I don't know why I get forwards
because you will soon see but some of
these are absolute I feel like back in
the day when they were taken this was
the fashion like everyone wore creases
I'll tell you about creases in a section
so everyone wore like creepers and it's
not bad I can alter your ate in these
photos this was when I was like a fat
girl like I was in a funk girl but I
just dressed like a fat girl oh my girl
I'll just let this photo like
yeah that's me
I just like the fact that I've edited
the crap out of my eyes literally they
found my eyes so much that they like the
little black beads oh my god
first I'll show you the photos this is
the photo I remember I went through my
mom's jewelry box and I found this ring
and I thought it was so cool so like not
only way I could take a cool photo with
the ring in its effect like this and I
feel like that was like a photo that
everyone took when they were younger is
like had that thing you're like covering
their eyes like this the thing I want to
show you guys about inspire is I
captions this is what I'm thinking it's
six years ago
so is it 2017 is this when he's
imitating I think I would've just turned
13 the caption for this photo is
yeah I never seriously would I think it
is such a worthless I'm starting another
fighting with a classic caption this is
the photo here I entered it the crap out
of the photo by the way is that like a
fruit in the background behind me like
what is that I think it's a hair tie but
that literally looks like a proof
anyways a caption for this burger and
eventually I'm your biases if I can't
believe I was one of those people but
the caption is I can't even do it it's
so embarrassing okay I know I'm not as
pretty Oh some tumblr girls but it would
mean he's if I gotten in 4253 blogs

at old photos of your eyebrows and goes
holy we've come a long way because
oh my god those eyebrows and tragic
my I wrestle literally like this big I
just found this photo online so it might
be really blurred because it's like a
tiny photo a photo shoots like around my
friends houses or my houses on like the

Facebook photo I remember you girls from
my school posted on Facebook services

childhood growing up I look how happy I
was in this photo the way I dress
