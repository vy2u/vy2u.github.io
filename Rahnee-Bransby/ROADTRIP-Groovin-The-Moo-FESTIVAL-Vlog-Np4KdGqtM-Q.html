Ronnie and welcome back to my channel so
I have a bet on a very true tree outside
from pub to go to a festival of groovin
and reading actually you guys are
familiar with it I went last year I'm
honestly so excited the outfit that I
originally planned didn't arrive in time
so I shouldn't be a stressful week but I
just got together as no medicine sorry
kind of couple visits a I wear an alibi
I'm scheduled because why do I ever
Eliana plea I'm like to everything like
I actually should like introduce myself
I'm running raspy and I'm late to
everything in life so I'm just packing
up the canal and then we're going to eat
head down south so let's go it's going
to write true
sorry we just got to the house we're
staying at I feel a little bit awkward
because I only know like a few people
here because I'm with a different group
of friends so I probably won't blog
anything tonight just because I'm not
sure who wants to be on camera and stuff
like that sorry I will show you guys the
house tomorrow but it is freaking
amazing it is honestly so stunning so we
just did a free shop and now we are
going to chill out and then we're going
to go get dinner with a bunch of friends
so I might look a little bit of there
it's just because I'm not with my usual
group of friends so I don't know how
they would act around the whole blogging
and YouTube part of things yeah I'm
going to go inside now and unpack a
little bit and I'll see you guys soon
so it is 8 o'clock right now and we are
about to go into town and get some
breakfast
it is so freezing here like this is my
attire right now this is what I'm
working it's so cold out here but it's
so nice that the fresh air is amazing is
everything about being out here is
incredible it's so peaceful as so I woke
up five o'clock this interview because
I've had this sleeping lately where I've
been waking up at like 5:00 and 6:00
a.m. every morning I don't know why
there's nice to get up early I guess to
get more out of your day so we're going
to get breakfast and then I'm going to
come back and do my makeup and get ready
so let's go I'm so excited for today
I've already done my foundation and
concealer but I thought I would do a
quick little before and after through
this kind of a before so this is we
asked our makeup I just put on a bit of
iridescent relax a little bit harshly my
athlete but that's what I'm wearing so
now Prix has started I'm going to start
drinking and the GPM part of the world
will probably start now so in jellies

had four hours late last night and my
hair is literally like and I can't even
brush it like inside out yes enzymes

compared to last year it was making so
happy because I can see how much I've
grown since last year it's like eight
o'clock in the morning

about to head home and it's not safe a

chopped environment market presence but
