wearing in today's video so I feel like
this some sort of weird thing going on
hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel thank you so much for watching
so in today's video I decided to film a
question that some video but not any
regular Q&amp;amp;A I decided to add a little
twist to these Q&amp;amp;A and I took to
Instagram and asked you guys to ask me
some really weird a funny strange
serious crazy questions so I decided to
film this to a nice today so you guys
could get to very few we have sides for
me a little bit battle so I'm kinda
nervous and excited to see what you guys
have asked me so let's go ahead and jump
into the field
so let's top up with a question that I
am dreaming up right now because I would
rather be anywhere but school and that
is if you could be anywhere in the world
right now where would you be and who
would you be with so this morning I
watched Claudia Salukis Bahamas vlog and
all of my god I am so jealous so if I
could be anywhere right now it would
definitely be the Bahamas and of course
I would be that my little love Brayden
the next question is which can he
shivers would you love to be roommates
with so of course it would definitely
have to be caught in your Chloe and
Shani because they are just mounted with
Three Musketeers but if anyone else it
would probably be lost a lot which is
Katy and Desi Perkins because they seem
like the funniest bunch of girls they're
so selfish if you guys had one snapchat
you would definitely understand that
joke so yeah I think that would be so
fun to like hang out with and the
roommates me I'll probably definitely
Claudia stilinski because freaking hell
she is just stunning and just love it
just love this the next question is
definitely a gross one it is would you
rather like an old man's hairy sweaty
armpit or we start in a really smelly
elevator for 30 minutes oh my god okay
so I I just hate this one beer or
anything I can't stand it and I would
not want to lick a sweaty hairy armpit
because I work in the cafe
so when if I see like someone's head in
my food when I collect places like I
literally moment and I always have
perfume in my bag so I would probably
rather be stocking and really smelly
elevated for 30 minutes because I would
just spray like perfume up my nose and
that's problem solved the next question
is what is the best thing about living
in Perth it would have jobs that have to
be the Sun sets because path has the
most amazing sunsets ever like I know
experience sunsets anywhere else in the
world as amazing as Perth and I am such
a skylight you I don't know if that
makes sense but I freaking love this guy
and like sunsets and sunrises and stuff
and even Troye Sivan said in one of his
videos called snapshots
I can't remember what one but he even
said Perth has the best sunsets anyway
oh definitely it would have to be
Fremantle because as soon as my
boyfriend improve to Fremantle I have
literally been there every week of my
life and I just love the vibe that it's
so chewed and everyone's kind of like
that one little person and just don't
really care sorry that is probably my
favorite thing about pop would be
Fremantle as well and that's kind of
where my fashion is inspired from
because it is so I'm like different I
really like you me and everyone has such
different style sense sorry I freaking
love Fremantle's so it would probably be
the sunsets every mental my phone so the
next question is we had habits when you
work in so you see I in Australia I'm
not sure if anyone else and what does
about a lot of people put that fridge
that fridge that bread in the freezer ah
I know who eats put me in this race up
just because it's taste like fresh more
longer than putting it in the cupboard
because I can kind of mode off to a week
or so so you can have bread in the
freezer so when I was younger we stir up
my families to all have like breakfast
and just have toast for breakfast
off to school and work and stuff but
instead of toasting my bread I would eat
my bread frozen with butter on a seller
own
so pretty much money would have it was
eating frozen bread I've no sure if
that's normal
let me know if you guys have this weird
habit as well he did when he little
because when I was in oh I freaking
loved it I think frozen bread was the
best thing on the planet but now I meant
the thought of frozen bread it's
disgusting and I don't know what was
wrong with me but the next question is
would you rather eat chocolate that
tastes like whoo I'll prove that tastes
like chocolate to be honest I would
probably rather eat chocolate that
tastes like whoo
because I probably vomit it but at least
I'm eating something that tastes nice
but then again if I ate the present
tastes like chocolate
I would probably vomit because of the
taste but at least I'm eating something
that's it edible so I probably go in
whose it tastes like chocolate even
though it's probably not really healthy
for my body at least it would taste nice
the next question is can you do a
boyfriend tag food now I know this is
the most requested video ever since I
started my channel every single time I
post a video some will comment asking me
to do a boyfriend tag and I promise you
guys and we come very very soon
so I just really want to wait till
Braden is like comfortable was going on
camera and stop so I promised a
boyfriend time would come very very soon
I just not sure how soon I'm aiming to
get out within the next two months would
you rather be hairy all over or
completely bowled now the other day I
thought about this question for quite a
while and I would actually rather be
hairy all over because you can
definitely shave your body like just
like shape your body every week I guess
and then you would be helis but if you
were bold that means you never have
eyebrows or eyelashes or hair so you
my wigs and like drawing your eyebrows
and probably tell you them on so I
definitely rather be hairy over and just
shave my whole body every single day or
week then be bored
the next question is would you rather be
blind or deaf I mean like hearing music
and stuff is such an amazing like being
like I would definitely not be able to
live without music but being blind you
would just not be able to see the world
you wouldn't be able to see what you
look like or your family or anything so
I would definitely rather be able to see
than be over here because the world is
such a beautiful place
and I would not want to miss that or the
music or something sir oh definitely
rather be blind than death who do we
need a fight between a grilled cheese
sandwich and a stalker definitely the
grilled cheese sandwich because the
grilled cheese sandwich would have just
came out the choice was so hot so if it
was like to fire at the top I wouldn't
it like no it would like the sour cream
and stuff on the inside hence if the
grilled cheese that we just slapped the
talk or if the taco would just like
crumble because it is like a really hot
crisp show so her cheese sandwich would
definitely win out in the taco the next
question is do you drive an automatic
car or a manual car now I Drive a mad
new car I was always gonna grab for my
order license but my driving instructor
is my best friend's dad and it was like
no way hell am i letting you go for your
order license that is so useless sorry I
know some people outcomes will be
driving me manual but I was petrified I
was like oh my god I'm gonna die like
this is terrible but I picked it up
within like 10 minutes and it seriously
sorry easy and so much fun driving in my
new so I'm so glad I got my manual
license so yeah I Drive a manual or very
I do you have an order car so that's a
bit confusing but I kind of want a
manual car but I'm sorry sorry I have an
order call do you have a neat name for
Brandon if so what is the meaning behind
it so I usually just call Brayden be for
some reason
these are really meaning behind uh I
don't really know where I came up with
the name B I just was like B and then of
course I'm just calling other names like
honey sugar monkey puppy you just random
names like that but the main one I call
him is B don't know why I don't know
where I came from but Wednesday I was
like B and it's stuck ever since
so and the very last question I have for
you today is what is your favorite TV
series now I have a few but my two main
ones at the moment I definitely pretty
little liars oh my god that is so
intense right now I'd like for you off
today please leave a comment below

about Pretty Little Liars and also
MasterChef I freaking love MasterChef oh
my god MasterChef Australia is just
probably my favorite TV show you I feel
like such a mom when I say that but

good so now you're gonna be questions
that you guys have asked me thank you so
