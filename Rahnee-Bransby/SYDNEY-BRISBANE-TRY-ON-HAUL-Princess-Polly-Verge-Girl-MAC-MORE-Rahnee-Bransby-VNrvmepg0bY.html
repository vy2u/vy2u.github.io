to city life flashlights when the foul
and to that night hi everyone I'm Ronnie
and welcome back to my channel thank you
so much for watching for all my new
viewers I just want to say it welcome to
my channel and thank you so much for
subscribing
I hit 10,000 subscribers a few days ago
and that is insane I which really never
in a billion years so I would even reach
10,000 subscribers or even here as fast
as I did I mean I haven't we don't need
you for that long so it means it's not
well to me and now I'm at 2000 I think
so that's insane to me I just wanna say
thank you so so much it literally means
the world and all your amazing comments
and stuff makes me so happy so thank you
at once again so as your very I just got
back from Sydney and Brisbane and if you
have not seen it yet I will need my
Brisbane look here so you can click on
that and watch would if you want to so
today I'm going to be filming my first
ever home and travel video so if this is
just some stuff I picked up in Sydney
and Brisbane apollo's over there so I
closed I can't make up my adult sized
sunglasses I have bad so let's go ahead
and jump on the internet and I hope
you'll enjoy sorry I'm going to start
off with all the stuff I read that from
princess Polly so while the other girls
were in season
we were invited to go to successfully
headquarters and try out all the clothes
and take photos and whatnot so I grabbed
a few stuff while I was there so the
first thing I picked up you guys have
probably seen in this Instagram photo it
is just this great place suit and it's
really simple it looks like a business
so my favorite thing about this place
where it isn't me back it just drops
quite the lowering it has an open back
and I love any clothing that opens back
because I think they just saw something
and I just love but it is really plain
and simple but I just like your pets
with a belt to make it look a lot more
dressed up and a bit more that's hard
but this is the label atmosphere and I
just thought that you said extra extra
small and I actually wasn't going to get
this it is a big thing for me and so
when I try to and it just looks really
die and stuff but I always thought that
if I had it with a belt it might look
good so I'm actually glad I bought this
is so comfy and I actually really liked
it so the next thing I picked up is
another place root and it's just this
really pretty pink blue and orange a
yellow color place suit I think they
decided this place we is so stunning and
it's just like the such a unique
different style and this place too is so
company and so summery so I really like
that and I like how it has a open back
as well because as I just said I love
open back loose so I picked up that one
as well and that is the label he doesn't
know why and I got that in the size 8 so
the next thing I picked up is a tub and
this is the label at the 5th as well I
am an obsession with the label at the
rim
sighs extra extra small so it's just
this platinum black and white striped
top and it's a crop top and I really
like the sort of this because it's quite
broad and square so it just kind of
likes luck when you wear it it's like
really quite stiff if that makes sense
but it's really puffy as well so I
really like that and the gray suits
pretty much everything and dress it up
and wear it casual as well so the next
thing I picked up from good-sized pulley
is a bag and it's this stunning coffee
colored bag and it just has these really
pretty gold studs detailing on the front
and it has these tassels hanging of the
edge which I love because I freaking
have an obsession with Tessa backs up
movements and I love this bag and the
color of it because I really like mixing
colors together when I wear clothes and
stuff so I think like I would even wear
this bag with this outfit because I just
want to look up comes me mixed together
sorry it's just a shoulder bag sorry I
am obsessed with this bag and the last
thing I got from princess Polly I was
actually going to do with all that
makeup products I go up I know this
hurts
so I thought I might as well include it
and this is the alignment climate
Velveteen in the shade at Salem which
I've actually recommended today it's
just this really pretty and dark brown
color it's thank you for an I like it so
if you'd like to see a tutorial with
this lip color please tell me because I
so the next place I went in Spanish go
and this is one of my new favorite shops
I have an obsession with this job I
always loved it but I never thought I'd
actually touch anything from it but now
I feel like I'm gonna touch my whole
wardrobe from there because I love that
shop
the first thing I think that there was
just this felt and it's just a matte
black belt and I was just really pretty
like floral print in it and she's gonna
super buckle and I feel like it's both
because we prepared with everything and
I have enough sessions without something
like a huge obsession with notes so I
really just wanted a plain black build
so I picked up that the next thing I
picked up from vertigo was a dress so it
is just this denim looking at dress and
I really like this dress because once
again it has an open back and it is
high-necked as well I really like this
dress like different and I really like
high neck stuff as well so I picked up
that sari at the next place I went to is
Duch boutique and I've always really
liked it shove it so the first thing I
picked up for these are white shorts and
I really like these white sure they're
really basic and simple but they are so
nice and they go with everything and
they also make me look really tense
which is good I have an essentially Big
Show's at Lerman I went in a ton and you
would have seen them in
my Brisbane love once again they told me
about that I'm plugging in and the next
thing I picked up which you would have
seen from my athlete of the day in my
brisbane of look is this orange crop top
and this is high-neck once again I have
an obsession with high-necked
so it just ties around the neck and then
it turns around the back as well and
it's backless there we go in my other
obsession so it's just this orange and
red a crop and has this really cute
argument and I'm obsessed with this
stuff at the moment and I've never
actually ordered an orange piece of
clothing as I've got so many compliments
on it saying that it like really work
for Miss eternity I really like value
sir while William Sidney the gals in
Ireland of shopping and vintage stores
and stuff so the first thing I thought
was these sunglasses and I have a huge
obsession with some boxes and women and
I freaking love these so they just
happen three lenses and the frame of
them is Olympic dream so that's what
they look like so when I arrived in
Sydney I got to see me at 10:00 p.m. at
bats and cutting out right there way
before me in the daytime so while she
was there she went off shopping and
stuff and she picked up is really
dominating belt and she picked it up
with herself
but when we got back to Brisbane and she
was like I don't think I felt gonna fit
me it's traceable to each other and I
was like you should just like yeah
shelves at you Sarah and yes oh my god
this value is stunning so it is just
this adorable
sparkly investor has a little vibrator
has these really adorable colored jewels
on it as well and I love this bout it is
sorry for being adorable SIMEX I'm a
Ducati apostle unto me because I'm
obsessed with it and Katya I promise
I'll make good wear out of it
now maybe else you can make up a cute
self I firstly picked up the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette and I'm sure that
the colors in are so stunning and
another what comes with this little
sleeve thing so it tells you all the
colors on it so because it's actually
made me buy this palette is this one up
here which is the shade of triple fudge
and in matter silences it's just this
really pretty dark dark brown almost
black shade and this one here which is a
marzipan which is a gorgeous pearly pink
shade and I'm assessing those two chains
so I love them I actually miss us with
all the shades in this palette so I'm
glad I got my hands on it as ears the
next thing I picked up was a matte
lipstick so this is the lipstick in the
chain of velvet teddy and I actually
want some back to pick up the lipstick
in shame 100 athletes but they do not
really stop and the lady recommended it
though that 10 equals look really good
on it sounds like why don't we come up
the next makeup products I picked up is

always wanted to start rumors about it
so I finally picked it up so I love it
it works once on my eyelashes and makes
them look amazing and the last makeup
product I picked up was the nostrils I
initiated abstainers I love this ones I
act referred collier's while I was
staying with her and I believe

some really cute little present so the
fact that I have sent it was this
amazing dress which I'm wearing right
