today today I can share with you all
welcome to Sydney
so anyway welcome to our vlog I think
this is lunch for Thursday's no five six
seven
I
so excited too much I'll explain
everything kind of getting some that
when I'm there so I'm going to eat the
glad for six months and I'm Phineas
anything outside money
Hey
through this scary scary scary
like that
when I get back to that we thought
totally explain everything to us by
going to find today and it's so painful
a bit of shopping shopping I think I'm
in love
yeah so fast-forward three days later
I'm actually at home now back in Perth
but I never got to explain what I'm
getting done to my teeth or anything so
I thought I'd quickly explain to you
guys on this day what I'm getting on so
pretty much on the day I enjoy a lover I
got my teeth checked I got them cleaned
I got more experience for my Invisalign
so that has sorry I just I ran upstairs
I'm losing my breath so the more tough
to get sent to the u.s. to get fitted
for my teeth shape obviously and I'll be
back in six weeks so I go back to Sydney
around five to six weeks from now to get
my Invisalign so while I was there he
just wants my teeth which looks so light
and I've already feel so much more
comfortable in my teeth which is crazy
for me to say because I've never ever
said that before but yes so I like to
somehow go back to see me pick up my
Invisalign I have my Invisalign for six
months so to like June July so by that
point my teeth will be very straight
which will be so exciting
so then after six month period has
passed I go back to Sydney and then I
get any veneers or anything and get my
teeth whitened again I guess and then
that is the final result
I'm so excited and so thankful for this
literally a second dream come true I
never thought in one year that I would
say I'm gonna have three to three mice
it's just crazy to me and I can't wait
like because I feel like I'm gonna look
like a completely different person
I'm nervous but I'm so excited yes I'm
very thankful
ah
good morning everyone so welcome today
at 7 now before we get into it I'm gonna
quickly say you guys can probably tell
I'm quite sick at the moment well I'm
not actually sick it's so weird my
throat doesn't hurt and I don't have
like a flat me throat very confronting
but like I'm not actually sick like my
voice is invoked or anything I just
haven't really sore throat for some
reason like to the point I can't even
talk properly but yeah so it's day 7
it's my last day I fly out at 8 p.m.
which is so good because we have the
whole day to do stuff so we are just
going to a cafe called bloom right now
to get breakfast and yeah Buster this
morning I do want to wear any makeup so
I just don't like the tiniest bit of
makeup and a boldly because I'd like
nerves go on and it took me like 20
minutes to do this and some we did a
full phase in the amount of time I did
