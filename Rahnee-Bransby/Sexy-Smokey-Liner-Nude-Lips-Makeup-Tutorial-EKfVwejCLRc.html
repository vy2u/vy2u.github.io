my channel so today I wanted to sit down
and fill my makeup tutorial for you guys
and this is a look I came up with I've
gone for a super smoky liner somebod
lashes and a nude lip
now I suck at eyeliner I'm so bad but I
tried my hardest and I guess it didn't
turn out that bad I think this look
would be perfect for like a night out or
something like that it's not true crazy
it's just super sexy I think so if you
guys would like to see how I created
this look then it please keep on
watching and let's go
my jacket just opened so here we are
fresh face I have no idea what makeup
look I'm going to do today I'm just
going to wing it all but I nori I do
want to use the zoeva Koko to blend
palette because oh there are some
beautiful shades in here now I'm going
to leave you guys to watch I'm going to
do voiceovers for this video because I'm
gonna be doing all sorts of weird things
I have no idea what makeup look I'm
doing so now let's move on to voice
sizes starting out with primer I'm using
the Too Faced hangover primer and the
o23
ready to glow primer I'm mixing these
together and I'm just working that into
my skin with my fingers
I just have to quickly say it this
foundation is way to job for me because
I don't have a fake town on it I'm gonna
put through it I don't have a fake town
on at the moment but I'm just gonna rock
it this is one of my favorite
foundations so boom maybe on to
foundation I'm going to be using at the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
as I said this is one of my favorite
foundations ever the coverage is amazing
and it just looks so nice and fresh on
the skin so I'm just going to be
blending that a net with a damp Beauty
Blender and just dabbing away for
concealer I'm going to be using the
Maybelline 24-hour superstay concealer
to conceal and highlight my under eyes
and down the bridge of my nose this
concealer literally cancels out all
darkness under the eyes I join in how it
doesn't it is seriously incredible
so once again just going ahead and it
blending that unit with the dark Beauty
Blender
now taking my poor beat-up Allison Jade
at constant palette this palette has
definitely seen better days and I'm just
taking the banana shade and setting onto
my eyes and down the bridge of my nose
and of course taking my trusty old
Australis fresh Louis to set the rest of
my face now I'm going in with this
middle brown shade from the Allison
Jerry contour palette and I'm not really
going to be contouring more just
bronzing up the outer parts of my face
so I'm not really focusing on contouring
I'm just kind of going ahead and
bronzing up my cheekbones on my forehead
at my jaw line and then I'm going to go
in and contour my nose
and then taking one of my favorite
products ever ugly Matt go deposit and
going ahead and further bronzing up the
outer parts of my face so I'm just
applying this to my cheeks and my
temples and then I just quickly got our
camera to fill in my brows with the Mack
brow pencil and this brow pencil makes
my brows look at so freakin good it is
one of my favorite brow pencils ever and
now I'm going in with the Zoe buckaroo
blends palette and I'm taking the shade
at substitute for love which is just
like a warm soft brown and I'm going to
work that into the crease as my
transition shade
now I'm going in with a shade of beans
are wide which is just like a really
dark chocolate brown it's kind of good a
black on to turn to it but this is the
shade I'm going to use for my liner
sorry I'm taking a zueva winds at liner
brush and I'm just going to start
mapping out where I want the liner to be
so starting on the base of the lid and
then I'm going to wing it out now this
took me so long because I'm very I'm
very I'm really not the best at wing
liner I do have trouble doing it so it
did take me a while but we got during
the end
once I mapped out where I wanted the
line is fie I went in with a zoeva
smudger brush and I'm just going to be
smoking that liner out and making it
super smoky and super smoky and then I
went in with the shade at bitter start
and I just packed this all over the lid
lightly um went over the lid with this I
think I wanted to do it just kind of
made the lid look a bit better I don't
know it's not necessary I don't know and
then I went ahead and applied some
lashes these are the Mac 48 my number
one favorite lashes ever then I'm going
in with a shade of freshly toasted which
is like a really dark kind of like a
milk chocolate brown it's kind of got a
red undertone to it and I'm just
applying this all my voice I'm just
applying this along the lower lash line
and blending that out and then going in
with a Mac mascara this is another one
of my favorites desmos car actually has
true ones which is so cool one for the
top lashes and one for the bottoms sorry
just going ahead and creating my bottom
lashes with a few coats of mascara and
then I'm going in with the gorgeous gold
shade which is called it's subtle blend
and I'm just going to be applying that
on my inner corners
and after you highlight my face I'm
taking the hourglass ambient light
luminous light highlighter or setting
powder I don't really know what this
product is useful but I use it to
highlight so I'm just throwing this all
over my face everywhere it's going
everywhere and for the last step moving
on to lips I'm taking the colour-pop
lippie pencil in the shade key and just
applying this all over my lids and I'm
also going to color in my lips of this
just to give a really nice color I won't
live in the place today I don't know how
to describe anything
and lastly going in with the Rimmel
London apocalypse lip black paint me
shade nude eclipse and applying this on
top of that lip liner and I really
regret doing this I really I join her
why I feel like this lip color made me
look really ugly and I wasn't going to
upload this makeup look because of this
lip color but I did it anyway and I
strongly regret it I just don't think it
suits me very well sorry I really hope
