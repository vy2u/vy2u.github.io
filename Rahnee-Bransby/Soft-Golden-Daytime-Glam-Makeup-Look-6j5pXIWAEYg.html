hey guys it's Ronnie and welcome back to
my channel so today I've created this
soft golden glam makeup look I am aware
I have a few makeup looks so similar to
this on my channel but this is a tiny
bit different this one is more soft and
daytime appropriate and I seriously
cannot go wrong with God and makeup
looks I love filming them and I love how
they turn out they I'll seriously my
all-time favorite makeup look so we're
gonna jump right into it today if you
guys would like to see how to recreate
this makeup look then it please keep on
watching and let's get straight into it
I haven't really gotta stop talking with
my hands that's going sorry I've already
started with filling in my brows and
practice came up with these Smashbox
photo finish primer water and the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
and now I'm moving onto foundations and
I'm using the covergirl outlast stay
luminous foundation in the shade at
medium beige and I'm just going to apply
this all over the face with the dark
Beauty Blender
oh my god this foundation smells so bad
this is really weird but I feel like
this smells like like rotten butter or
like rotten popcorns like it's awesome
not to highlight engine sue under the
eyes I'm using the Rimmel London wake me
up concealer in shade ivory and I'm just
going to apply this on my eyes and John
the bridge of my nose
and you guys know the drill I'm going to
take my other Sanjay to hunters palette
and set on my eyes with a banana shade
and then I'm setting the rest of my face
with my Australia's fresh and flawless
press powder in the shade darkest Brown
I feel like I need to do my makeup a
different way next time because I really
hope it's not boring you guys I
literally do my makeup the same every
single time I just swap out the products
if I make sense a not saying looks but
the same what's cool the same way like
foundation concealer powder contour
now I'm going to take my Mac Bruns
bronzing powder and I'm going to really
intensely contour my face and my nose
and you guys always ask me what contour
brush I use so this is a sigma f or five
a small contour brush
moving on to the eyes I'm going to be
using the Milani cosmetics treasure
chest palette now I just so say this in
the mail and it is seriously it's so
stunning like the packaging is just gold
glitter and it shades in here oh sorry
no so there's so many like gold and
bronze tones so this palette is going to
be perfect for this makeup look I'm
going to start out with a mix of pearl
and tiger eye and I'm going to mix these
two together and use this as my
transition shade to blend these shades
through my crease I'm going to use a
zoeva concealer buffer brush I literally
love this brush for transition shades it
works so well it's supposed to be a
concealer brush but oh well
sorry I just saved you guys in a bit
because you guys always ask me to zoom
you in when I do my eye shadow now for
the eyes I want them to be very mutual
sorry I'm taking tiger eye again but I'm
taking a tiny bit of smoky cortes I'm
just going to use this through dark not
be out of it I don't want it true heavy
sorry I'm going to go really light with
this shade
after I've applied the lid shade then
I'll go through and talk about if I want
it to be a little bit darker and alpha
the lid I'm taking the shade at smartgit
our pod
I'm going back in with the shade it's
Mickey Cortez and I'm just going to
darken up the out of it a little bit
more as I'm taking tigereye again to
blend out my lower lash line
people always ask me why I never apply
my lashes on camera and it's because I
have a really sensitive eyes sorry my
eyes got really red and little now that
the lashes and mascara is on and I
waited a little bit for my eyes to go
back to normal I'm going to be taking
the trade at topaz and I'm just applying
this as my inner corner highlight
moving on to blush I'm going to be
taking the mellow cosmetics but face
blush in the shade of bronze and I'm
just going to be fronting up my whole
face
nakahara I'm taking my brand-new
all-time favorite this actually comes in
like a little cheeks palette but you can
buy it on its own it is Vietnam
albatross highlighter
oh my god I am obsessed with this it is
sort of stunning oh my god just look how
beautiful that is
it looks really white in the pan but
then you apply it to your face and it is
seriously the most gorgeous golden glory
I'm like obsessed
now to pull the whole look together for
lift and taking the Miller Cosmetics
lipstick in the shade of posh wear this
to swatch it is quite a pinky shade so I
might go and relieve that a nude liquid
lipstick or something just depending on
how thick this is because I do want the
lips to be nude
I should really like the pink I think it
looks good I'm going to leave it like
that and to pull the whole look together
of course I'm going to set my face with
my Urban Decay all nighter Sainsbury I
just forgot the name of that just then
and here is the completed makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
