back to my channel so Valentine's Day is
a true days away so I thought why not
upload a valentines day makeup look for
you all so this is the makeup look I
came up with this is very soft pink
tones on the eyes with a soft pink
glossy lip I do want to go too overboard
up crazy I just wanted to keep it very
nice and simple so if you would like to
see how to achieve this gallery
valentines day makeup look then please
keep watching and let's jump straight
into it there were some cool hand
gestures also just one quick side note I
have a cut on my lip and it's starting
to scab which is not cute at all so if
you see that and think running what the
hell is on your lip it is just a cut
don't be sad and yeah just starting out
with foundation and taking the
maybelline fitme matte and poreless in
the shade 220 and i'm just applying this
over my skin with a damp Beauty Blender
now if you do use Beauty blenders make
sure you dab the provincial skin and
don't swipe it this will get more of a
full and flawless coverage so that's a
little fact to conceal and highlight any
dark circles or redness I'm going in
with the L'Oreal True Match concealer in
the shade light and i'm just applying
this under my eyes down my chin on my
forehead and on my Cupid's bow and just
blending that out with the tip of a damp
Beauty Blender
and to set the places i highlighted I'm
taking the ass enjoyed contour palette
and taking the banana shade and just
applying that to the places i
highlighted and I'm doing this with a
Real Techniques contour brush and my
voice is leaving the room and you guys
know the drill and setting the rest of
my face with my australia's fresh and
flawless pressed powder in the shade
darkest brown and now i'm just taking my
natio contour kit and i'm going to be
taking the darkest brown contour shade
in the palette and concurring my face

found lately I am so obsessed with it

the moment is the nation contour brush

ever you have to try it so I'm just
going to be contouring my cheekbones my
forehead and my nose
so you add a splash of color to the
cheeks and taking my makeup geek blush

cheeks with a zoeva wait Zoe veldt Lux
sheer cheek brush sony Shh now I'm so

caramel brown tone and I'm just blending
that into the crease as my transition
