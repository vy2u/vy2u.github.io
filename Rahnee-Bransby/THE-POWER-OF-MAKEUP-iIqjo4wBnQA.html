this side all natural whoa for
plantation i'm going to be using one of
my favorites this is the gorge hermano
luminescent foundation in the shade of
5.5 this is a full coverage foundation
so it's going to cover up or mouth
infections or my discoloration and my
dark circles and
everything else that's on my face sorry
I'm going to apply this on my face with
my finger and then blend it you know
