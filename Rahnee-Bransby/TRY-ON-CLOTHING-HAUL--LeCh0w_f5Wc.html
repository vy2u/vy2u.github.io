pretty damn hungover right now but life
goes on let's roll with it and all sorry
I haven't washed my hair in about a week
so my hair is super oily and I tried to
put curls in to hide the fact that I
haven't washed it in a week but that
failed just like everything else I do
and the cows didn't even work out either
still that failed - hello everybody its
Ronnie and welcome back to my channel
what was that greeting hello so today I
bring you yet another huge try on a
cleaning haul I don't know why I said
huge because it isn't that big it isn't
as big as my usual clothes on triangles
clothes on triangles clothes on trying
hauls clothes on trying holes alright
I've decided that I'm going to start
filming at these once a month so every
month I'm going to have a monthly try on
haul because I love doing these videos
you guys love watching them and I buy a
lot of clothes I do a lot of shopping so
so today I'm going to show you guys all
the clothes that I have received or
purchased in the past three or three
weeks so if you enjoyed this video
please don't forget to give out massive
thumbs up so let's get on to trying some
clothes and showing you what I have okay
I'm going to go store by store so share
with you guys everything that I've got
from that one throw then move on to the
other store etc etc so first all that I
got three items from is an online store
called at Molly and Wolfe
now the lovely are not this so I reached
out to me and asked if I wanted a few
items from her online store now we have
actually been talking back and forth and
commenting on issues for the movers
and commenting on each other's photos
back and forth for a very long time now
so when she reached out to me I got way
too excited a little too excited and
yeah these are the items at the top so
pearl shirt I got is this crop here so
this is just a plain black crop with the
Rolling Stones logo on the front
I've wanted a Rolling Stones of shirt
for the longest time now and this one is
literally perfect because it's not too
crazy or it's not over-the-top it's just
very simple and basic I absolutely love
the vintage visor blue shirt comes off
and it is one of my go to shoes at the
moment the blank in my throat when I
just have to run errands or something I
love just drawing on like a crop with
jeans that's all you'll see me wearing
throughout the week so this has been one
of those tops that I can just jump on
and gory and I also really love it it is
definitely one of my favorite tracks at
the moment the next thing I picked up is
actually a full piece of bathing 3 and
it is a little bit crazy a little bit
out there I don't think we ever owned
property but but I absolutely love how
funky it is it is this bathing suit here
now first of all I'm done holding it
right now for me so the one thing I feel
like a monkey the one thing I absolutely
love about this agency is how bright and
colorful it is it is going to be perfect
for this other time and it is just
around the corner here in Australia
story I'm so excited but I love it the
pink and purples and the crows and like
the Aqua turns on this I think they all
really complement each other the other
thing I absolutely love about this
swimsuit is the hips how high rise they
are they go super high and they sit just
above the hips so they're super super
hot and super super cheeky at the back
but I love that it kind of gives that
like 70s 80s vibe I'm so excited to rock
this at the beach in summertime and I
just think it is such a cool pop of
color and the last thing I got from
my animal vintages it is this pair of
black Wrangler jeans now these aren't
just your typical black regular jeans
these have a booty cut in them but these
have a bummer but just on the back of
one of the legs now I've wanted a pair
of jeans that have at this bond rib for
the longest time I think it's so cool
and so stylish and definitely spices up
a pair of jeans but yeah these are just
sorry vintage-looking I love the color
of them I love the wear of them they're
very like boyfriend or mom jeans and I
absolutely love the bomb rip now let's
move on to one of my all-time favorite
online stores so you guys could guess it
in a heartbeat it is princess Polly now
I love getting pieces from princess
Polly I always get pieces from princess
boy because it is just one of my
favorite online stores it has the most
amazing clothes and have such a variety
of clothes as well so I really think it
tooks everyone's style so I got a few
things that some princess Polly so let's
jump in and see what I got up so the
first one is another crop that I've been
at just storing on and going out the
door I absolutely love this one it is
actually one of my favorite crop that I
own it as well it is this one here and
it does have love will travel now I
absolutely love the print on this I
think it's so cool it kind of looks like
a really old vintage banty in a way but
it isn't a banty it is like a really old
vintage country tea
I don't worry but yeah this is just like
a dark navy crop and as this print on
the front which I absolutely love and
yeah I just love it
I think it's so cool it is one of my
favorite shows from the moment and the
fabric topic is sort incredibly so now
the next thing I got is to start a bunny
suit here and once again look at that
another favorite of mine I absolutely
love this bodysuit it's not my favorite
clothing items at the moment I've been
wearing this like crazy and I have to
like really separate my Instagram photos
at the moment because I've just been
posting so many photos in this because I
just been wearing it so much and it
looks like this is one piece of clothing
iron so when I saw this on the website I
had to get it because I just love the
yellow and the red and the black and the
white stripes I'm never really all ready
to talk like this or seen a talk like
this or bodysuit like this and I just
fell in love it was like love at first
but so it is high neck it just sits on
the shoulders and it has these half like
lumps please and then the back drops
really low as well which I love but
there's just something about this that
makes me fall in love with it every time
I see it it is just so beautiful and I
think the thing I love the most is the
yellow on it I don't own any yellow
pieces of clothing and yellow is such a
fun color to wear so yeah I love this
song so much now the next thing I got is
another yellow piece of clothing
now there's something about this piece
of clothing that caught my eye I don't
really usually I don't really usually
good where's Ronnie I don't usually lean
to something like this it isn't very in
my style but I thought I'd give it a go
and I actually love it because it's too
pretty very like I don't really own
anything like this at all
as I said before I don't really own
anything like this it's just this floral
print in place in here so it's like a
dog yellow kind of like a mustardy but
not really mustard a yellow color and it
has these pink and green flowers all
over it I just love the printer but I
think it is so like fun and girly and
I'm so excited to wear this in this
time it also has the flood bounds link
which I love as a moment as well
and it should sound like comfy and glowy
and I feel like it's going to be one of
those places that I just Chuck on and to
go and run wild you know because it is
poppy now I'm sure many of you can
guesses I have the biggest obsession
with jeans
there's something about jeans I love
wearing them and I just think they're so
comfortable and I literally have a weird
love for jeans so there's stuff like
flying everywhere oh go ahead so there
are these really dark blue denim jeans
here now the thing I love about these
jeans is once again at the roots in them
they have these huge rips in the knee
part your under each knee they just have
these massive rips in there like massive
ribs and now I really need which i think
is really cool it adds like a really
cool touch to the jeans they just look
so good on and I just think they're so
cool I absolutely love them yeah now I'm
sure everyone that has seen my photos
Marie that I always wear a hat there's
something about the sailor class that I
love and I have a huge or not huge but
I'm starting is going to be collection
of them now so this hat I picked up from
fantastically is another sailor's hat or
train drivers heart I like to call them
but it is just as bluish gray one here
and it has a brown band across it now I
don't Ori no one this color when I saw
this gray one I had to get it because it
is so different all the other ones I own
yeah there's hot I like my favorite hats
in the world as I just said like 20
times yeah I love that last thing I got
from princess Polly is a piece of
jewelry now surprisingly this is the
only piece of jewelry I picked up this
month which is so weird I feel like to
relate this more tomorrow it's just this
choker here now ignored a little long
thing at the back that's just like where
the clip is it's just this like humble
Brown felt troika and and it's just got
this little gold like detailing hanging
off
now I love this so much I don't already
choke like this so I think it is so cool
I love the color of it and I love the
little gold detailing as well so yeah I
was super excited to add this to my
collection
now the next thing I got I actually
received this two days ago and I was so
excited because I had no idea I was
getting it so these two things are but
I'm going to going to show one because
the other one I looked at Braden's but I
got these from a cotton on so thank you
so much condom for sending these out I
really wasn't expecting it is this
jumpsuit here so it is just a dark denim
jumpsuit so the front is very simple it
just is semi high neck it kind of sits
on the shoulders again like that and
then ready for it the bag detailing is
so pretty sorry it has this rose gold
zip down the back and then that has an
open bag so justice back hole in the
back I want to I was going to say back
and then I was in other words going
stigma and then these two like felt like
things on the side they just are on the
side and on the back which i think is so
cool but I'm so sad they didn't also I'm
drawing on me wearing this jumpsuit and
it was the cutest thing I've ever seen
in my life unfortunately I left that
afraid SSL so I can't show you guys bye
we'll persona instagrams on the path of
that now the next thing is I got a from
Jenner pants and it is the outfit I'm
actually wearing now
Serena's versus a cream shadow neck top
it is just like a rib material I
absolutely love Terminix
in the wintertime they are my favorite
and I love layering them under dresses
like I'm doing with this one now and
then the next thing I got is this dress
which I'm going over the top so it is
just a navy blue dress and I love how
flowy and like free it is you feel so
like free in it because it is sort like
soft and suchlike thin material but I
love layering this with a turtleneck on
top underneath in the winter time and
then in summer it is going to be perfect
just to wear on its bone and yeah I
absolutely love this through put
together as well the next thing I got
from German pants
cause a pair of sunnies I would never do
a home without a pair of sunnies in
because my especial with Sonny is like I
always say it's just out of this world
literally I really they are these ones
here now these are my new favorite at
the moment because I love like the
cutout shape of them I don't really own
sunglasses that are like this shape so I
think they're so cool and I also have
reflective lenses if you can see that
they just have go to reflecting but
lenses and a black frame I just love the
shape of these so much and I just think
they're so comfortable and oh I've spent
them a lot they're my new favorites at
the moment and the last thing I got from
general pants or a pair of shoes now
I've already won the hell out of these
and I've had them for about three days
or four days Congrats now I'm not sure
if any of you know you've probably seen
a pair of boots that I used to wear in
every single Instagram photo they are
just like a black fake leather breed and
they have like a console at the bottom
but unfortunately the brand or shoe they
are they make our style of shoes and
then they release a certain amount and
never make them again which is so
annoying so I couldn't get my hands on
those boots anymore and they were my new
favorite but literally I wore those
boots to the end of their days I love
them to every first of all I love them
every single day for about a year and a
half straight so the bottom of the song
sounded like to touch and I just kept
wearing them when they were still broken
so they got so certain broken thought
they weren't even fixable anymore so I
decided it was about time to get a new
pair so I picked up these pair from
general pants and now these are wings of
Smith so I can tell these are going to
last so incredibly long because they are
quite expensive
they can't remind me of like a workers
boot with the little like
panel on the side and then I also have a
point to tories these are going to be my
new festival boots and just my new boots
that I wear every to the day there's
sorry incredibly light and comfy to wear
as well yeah I just love these two bits
and I've already won the hell out of
them and it's been like three days okay
now it can be close to an end I have
three more things to show you guys and
they are three pairs of shoes they are
from an online store called eageriy in
the UK so the first part I got is this
pair here now absolutely love wearing
flies they're like my guru shirt they
like my grocer shoes it's just a chalk
on because I find them so comfy and so
quick and easy to put on they just use
black for first layers now I noticing
slides like this before they have like
the fur on the top here they're so soft
and they're so comfy but unfortunately I
like really big feet so these are a tiny
bit too small for me but they're still
wearable I think they're so comfy and I
just love these two bits like how cool
are they literally they are so cool now
the next part I think our story cool
I've seen these all over the internet
and I wanted a pair of these for the
longest time they are just use a black
fake leather boots here now the cool
thing about these that these are
actually c3 and they also have a
see-through heel as well I just think
that is so cool I have never owned a
pair of shoes that are like this before
so when I hope that these are so excited
unfortunately because they are think
like that they are kind of small so I do
suggest if you get these gather size up
because even a size up is still a tiny
bit too small for me but I literally
just have the biggest feet in the world
and now the last thing I have to share
with you guys in this haul is another
pair of shoes now can we just take a
moment for these shoes I usually have no
words
Oh ASA shoes are honestly the most
beautiful shoes I've ever seen in my
life they are so cool because they are
just like this mesh material so there's
completely see-through like the other
ones as well and they have a see-through
feel as well but I just love the
currency's aren't just one of my
favorite colors so when I received these
I was like whoa Jesus
they are so groovy and so stylish I've
never seen a bright orange shoe this
color before and when I posted a photo
of them on Instagram I got so many
compliments on them I absolutely love
them oh they're just like they're so
pretty so yeah that is all because I
collected it over the past two to three
weeks
I really have you guys enjoyed this
video right I love filming these videos
they are one of my favorites you know
the drill and don't forget to give this
video a massive thumbs up and subscribe
