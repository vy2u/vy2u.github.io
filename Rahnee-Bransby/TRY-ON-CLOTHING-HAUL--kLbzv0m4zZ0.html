my channel so today I bring you yet
another clothing hole I'm aiming to film
climbing holes every one or two weeks
because I love them when they see us
they had definitely my favorite and I
know you guys freaking love them too
so everything I picked up in this
clothing hole is from my favorite online
clothing store naked I done it so many
girls were naked and that's because I
literally love their clothes like they
have everything for everyone like I
always say I've also heard you guys love
with a rockin discount card so I'll
leave that links below so be sure to use
that if you want to save some money on
your purchase if you would like to see
any of my other clothing holes from
naked I believe that meets Valerie but
let's just jump straight into this one
sorry I picked up with two dresses from
naked by the way I was going through all
the clothes just before and getting them
all ready for this hole and I realized I
picked up no buttons like iron barely
any buttons especially summer bottoms I
only so many jeans but I don't or many
shorts or skirts and the main thing I
was looking for for this hole was shorts
and skirts and I picked up mountain so
whoo
so the first dress I picked up is by the
brand spell it now I'm showing you guys
but wonder that brand it is seriously
incredible slightly fast dress is this
one heel now if you guys know me you
know that my favorite color is orange
I'm obsessed with the color our age it
just makes me so happy so the color of
this dress is incredible and I love how
much the pink and the orange on this
dress complement each other I'm never
really been into printed dresses like
this or even printed clothing in general
but lately does be something about it
that I absolutely adore this dress is so
summery and it just reminds me of summer
so it's going to be perfect for summer I
think this look good perfect so if even
what I'm wearing right now just a hot a
truck and a pair of boots it's so flowy
and lightweight so it's perfect with the
weather that we have in a store
right now because it is getting into the
30s right now and it is so hot I got
this in an extra-small and the only
thing I can say is I wish they had an
extra extra small and not sure if they
do I don't think they do but if they
have an extra extra small it fit that
little bit more perfect because it is a
little bit long and a little bit big
around my chest I'm obsessed with this
and the color oh it's so beautiful the
next dress I picked up once again I wish
I got a size smaller because it is a
little bit on the big side but that's
totally fine it's too wearable and it is
this black dress you know this is by the
brand naked which is making six Khaleesi
but Brad
they obviously have their own brand when
I saw this I fell in love is it because
I'm they're really saying it dress like
this I love how it's got that little
panel across the chest and a little
cutout abs and me it also has such nice
material it's kind of like a silky
lightweight material but it's not silk
and yeah I just think this would be
perfect for a few events I have coming
up and I also love that you can either
dress this up or you can dress it down
maybe onto your tops I haven't so many
tops sorry please buy with me so the
first stop is this one here it's kind of
like a milky champagne shade the color
of the shirt is amazing I literally love
it and it complements nice you can turn
it really well so the style of this
shirt it's kind of like a blouse jacket
kind of thing I don't know it's long
sleeve and it ties up at the front as
you guys can see that you won't be oh I
just choked I also love how the style of
this ties up at the front sorry it is
showing a little bit of skin it sorry it
is a little bit sexy at the same time
the next time I picked up its by the
brown of Free People and it is just this
basic tank here the thing that caught my
eye about this shirt is the color I love
how it's kind of like a dusty rose color
my other favorite thing about this shirt
is the arm holes and they are so long
and I love that style because you might
bra less under it like the one I'm
wearing now this is a bra light by the
way you can wear really nice bra lets
under and they kind of just peek through
the side
this job is sorry insanely soft so I
can't wait to wear this during the
summertime
I think this will be perfect just to
throw over phases it just feels so comfy
and I can see myself wearing this a lot
throughout summer the next shot I beat
up it's also by the brand of Free People
and it is this top here once again I
love the color of this shirt it's kind
of like a Bodhi must be color in the
camera it is picking it up to be more
mustard but in person it is more golden
when I first got this shirt I was a bit
skeptical I didn't really know how I
felt about it but after trying it on a
few times and styling it a few different
ways I actually do really love this it
is very different to something I already
are and I love how it crosses over at
the top and there's not much to it if
that makes sense like the back is quite
open the halls of high open and the
front it's quite open sorry during the
day in summer when it gets ridiculously
hot this is going to be perfect but yeah
I think this is very pretty the next
shot I think up is this singlet here now
I love the metallic purple of this
singlet
it is sort groovy or reminds you so much
I'm like the 80s and the 90s the one
thing that makes me love it so much
about this show is do you remember those
chefs used to wear in like your four oh
five or six so I I just realized - you
guys are probably like 2010 and stuff
like that from Sucre I'll try I defer no
of them all of me wearing them and it
was similar style like this and they
came like every color every pattern
I used to earn so many I started
something like mesh say three ones and
like pink ones and white ones style if
this shirt reminds me it's so much of
them if you know what I'm talking about
please let me know in the comments so
I'm not the only one but I love the
spaghetti straps on this shirt I think
this would be perfect to tie up with a
pair of high-waisted jeans and a hat or
something like that
I think this shot is just so cool and I
literally love the metallic look of it
so this one is the same style as that
black dress I showed you by new top
version and it is what sorry I just
realized how crink with this is once
again I love the style of this how it's
got that panel across the breviary a--
and i also love how it is a cami I think
Tommy's go with everything I find them
so cute and yeah I just love it these
style of the show any launch that I
think top is all starting on the cami
it's a simple golden champagne
coming here why to say um but yeah I
just flat pasta pool what this is so now
let's move on to your bra let's I picked
up three pilots I don't even have to
tell you guys because it you guys know I
am obsessed with bra let's seriously
obsessed so the first one I picked up is
the one I'm wearing and now this
honestly is one of my favorite products
I've ever oh sorry tell me this doesn't
remind you of the Jamaican flag like
this literally looks like that you're
making flag this is by the ground one
teaspoon if any of you were wondering I
love the coffee olive color I think it
is sorry
beautiful kaki is one of my favorite
colors at the moment at Fitness it's
really nicely on my face because I have
a little tiny boobs sorry it kind of
sits on them really nicely sits on them
really nicely alright it is for feeding
and so flattering and I'm literally
obsessed with it every night's a
bralette I picked up it's a Calvin Klein
one and it is just this one here I love
this Calvin Klein ballet I've never seen
it before and I think it is so cool they
are so comfy they're so nice and there's
such good quality a wish I got this one
in a size and big night it's a tiny bit
tied around my chest area but I guess
that means that has good support nice I
picked up a pair of bikinis and Justin
foot they look like here I haven't
wanted a pair of these crocheted
colorful bikinis for the longest time I
think they're so cool and so summery I
love how the main focus of this bikini
is the color yellow because the yellow
which way screams hello and this is what
the bottoms would like advance super
cheeky like look at that bum galore any
last clothing item I picked up is a
denim jacket now wearing summer why did
I get into a jacket I'm annoyed I don't
know why it was a jacket but this is
what it looks like yeah and it's just a
to cool Levi's denim jacket this is kind
of a nervous eyes denim jacket but it's
kind of not if that makes sense it is
very fitting as well and I don't have
one like it so that's why I picked it up
and I love denim jackets you can never
go wrong with them sorry I just want to
quickly do a little disclaimer my
lipstick has started to go really weird
on my lips you know but it kind of like
goes crusty in the inside of your lips
it started to do that so please ignore
that it gets really bad
the end and I had no idea and it's
grossing me out sorry I'm really sorry
about that it's not bug see I had no
idea was that the nice two things I
picked up a jewelry so the first one is
this trike and here this is kind of just
like a fishnet troika I've got a thing
for fishnets at the moment you guys are
going to notice that in next week I
think when I go to a music festival
because my outfit is about fishnet I've
never seen one like this before and I
freaking love it it is so nice and so
flattering and I'm obsessed with that I
feel like this is going to be one of my
favorite meat chickens and the next
trick I picked up is this one here now I
love this I never seen one like this
before this was made up of these huge
rings which i think is so cool it is 319
and I literally can no way so that this
one because it is groovy as and the
last thing I picked up is a pair of
shoes I know you guys probably thought
it would be a pair of sunglasses this is
my first phone without a pair of
sunglasses surprisingly yes that is
correct it is a pair of boots I am
obsessive boots
so these are Jeffrey Campbell I love
these boots so much they're so different
to Bruce Ayari
first of all I love how they have these
three huge buckles on the side and I
don't know you guys will be able to see
but the halo of this is like a block and
it kind of sits out a bit sorry I don't
know can you see that it doesn't look
like it's a shape to fit the shoe
properly which is so cool it makes it
look Sasori groovy I do daksa don't we
get these in a size one too big I think
sorry I would just have to double up my
socks when I wear them but that means I
would get so feet but these are so cool
they're so grungy and edgy I freaking
love them and I can't wait to wear these
so that is all the items I picked up
from naked I'll leave a link to
everything blurry if you interested in
purchasing it and also you don't get to
use my discount card if you want to save
a little bit of cash I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you do that

sums up and also here tomorrow I'm
filming another closing hole sorry next
