back to my channel so it has been a hot
minute since I've sat down key articles
a video I honestly think it has been a
good at six months since I had six
months what will my in I honestly think
it has been a good two months since I
sat in my original filming space and
perseverance through this stuff still
very strange also you might notice if
you are new year I changed my background
a little bit I used to have like a lease
record platos outside here and be honest
I'm kind of overly like I've been very
open setting RIT so much leave so I
decided to get rid of that I still have
it and I also am thinking of selling it
so if you guys are interested in
purchasing it I will keep you posted and
it's not sure if I'm going to sell it
yet or not because I don't really use
with that much to be honest so I just
worked it out for three books I love
looking through these I get so much
inspiration from them and they literally
just right at my alley I love fashion
and you go through that sorry I think
that more me than a record player I will
leave some links below if you do want to
purchase these and then I just popped
two candles on top which I don't wanna
light because they smell way too good to
waste and I also chopped some glitter on
my eyes that is not not normal for me
because I'm obsessed as glitter and I
just felt like looking like a little
fairy today I will begin to the purpose
of change the carry and filming another
clothing haul I feel like I design a
clean hole in such a long time at one
point I was pumping these out like once
a week I'm very excited to be filming
and I want free bath today because I
know how much you love them and they're
like when my favorite videos to film so
today's clip Nicole is in collaboration
with white box boutique I've done a few
videos with them in the past and I
absolutely love that online store like I
have really good go-to and basic pieces
so yeah I love picking up a lot of bases
from them yeah I'm going to stop
rambling on everything that will be
featured
this video will be linked below and of
course is another clothing haul excited
and cozy five boxes of Rocky news
Campari so I would leave it on the
screen and less blurry on so inside help
I picked up three it's a seat leader
toss or bunny fruits what if you want to
pull them so the first one I grabbed was
this plain black foam heel I don't
actually own any plain black leotard
after light there are times where I'm
always looking for one to wear with a
nice pair dress pants going to go out
and stuff like that so this is just a
subject plain black leotard and I can
see myself wearing this a lot and a look
all year round and the next one as you
saw is just a talking leotard and this
one is a little bit different the black
on because it does have a low back as
you can see and the material is a little
bit different as well this is more of a
silky material kaki is one of my
favorite colors and I know this will be
another piece that I wear a heck of a
lot all year round the next thing I keep
thought is this mesh lumpley Tokyo I
think this is so groovy
I love how it's got little gemstones all
down it and I'll put it all down the
sleeves this is such good quality as
well you know sometimes when I'm shared
some self have just hangs on the
gemstones are really tacky and so like
they are gonna fill up this is totally
it not like out it's completely
see-through so you have to wherever I
lay under it if you want usually don't
have to I love how you could dress it up
or dress it down but I think this would
look so cool with a pair of math dress
pants or even under some overalls or
something like that and because I love
that black top so much I decided to get
it in this really pretty tan color
I feel like this color really
complements my skin tone and my features
so I can't wait to whether I think this
so pretty and I just love it i love the
gemstone deliver the next thing I got is
a three piece set now this is sort of
tuned I mean I Nestle for awhile now so
I'm really happy that I finally picked
it up so this is the top here is this
really nice like almost fake knitted
material it feels like such good quality
and it is so soft and cartoony I really
like how it's got this button detailing
down the front just to kind of give it
more of a sporty vibe I think that is so
cool
so one thing I will say about this top
it is a little bit small all my tops
idea in the size 8 or 6 sorry a if I
want it to be a little bit oversized but
I feel like in the
in a can because it's quite tight around
my armpits which is a bit weird but
other than that I think it is so cute
and I can't wait to honor I can surely
see myself wearing these as an everyday
pair of shorts with like a banty tucked
in the front or something like that as
such the quality and they just feel so
comfy and under certain them already the
next thing I received I actually didn't
ask for so I think you just might have
accidentally slipped in the package with
everything else
my first all right I will submit unsure
about it because it isn't really my
style but then I tried it on and outside
yet these are people so they are
conceived like acid-wash arms and shorty
oh now the reason I like you so much is
because the fascism they actually drop a
lot lower than they do at the front I'm
not huge a general short person because
I don't like the fact that sometimes
they are the same like all the way
around and above hence are and not about
that life but I really like how grips up
and phrases are and they actually sort
of can't be sometimes denim shorts can
be really uncomfortable but I feel like
you could only sleep in these the next
thing I'd like is the near the jump off
now I have seen this on at my girl sunny
everywhere and she absolutely rocked it
so I decided to pick it up for myself so
it is just this grey of the shoulder and
it's a jumper I like wearing this on one
shoulder and off on children and it is
so incredibly soft and sorry Pompey I
now know I saw me wear it all the time
winter is just around the corner here in
Australia so I know I'm going to be
absolutely living in this part winter
time and it is just so cozy and soft and
that's definitely what you want in
winter because winter is uncomfortable
and often King as you thought is another
oversized jumper now I'm all about
comfort sorry I definitely have to take
this up when I saw it it is just great
oversized sweater and now I love the
material of this this has like you know
not really stop material that jumpers
top on the inside this has that and I
absolutely love it it is really really
thick as well so I know it is going to
keep you super warm in the winter time
the only thing I will say is I got this
in a size 10 as I said I usually get a
size 8 but I got this in size 10 because
I wanted it to be a little bit more
sighs but unfortunately this is more
emphasized in width than it is in length
so it is a little bit poufy around my
shoulders but other than that is pretty
much fun yeah I do really like this and
it is so creepy and moving on the next
thing I pick up is another set now I'm
obsessed with active wear I wear it all
the time and puff I wanna count
everything today so active wear just
take a big part in my life because this
is the top here I actually work today
and it is so comfy I love how it is
really really thin and kind of sheer
material because I hate going to the gym
and wearing as hot that is like not
stick material but it's not sheer
because it just makes you sweat more and
it makes you hot and clustered and it's
cute Oh cute and it's not cute
and I also really like how to sell the
Razorback because I like when you can
see the sports bra underneath and these
other gym leggings here now I must save
you are probably my favorite pair of
jean leggings that I are now and I have
so many I just love the contrast of the
white the gray and the black on the
quality of these is actually insane
I love how when you stretch them they're
not see through because I have a fear of
wearing leggings and then scoring and
the bean see-through because that has
happened to me before and it is not cute
I really like how when you bend in these
or anything they don't this year I just
get these in Saturday because usually
engine Logan's they are quite tight just
pictures with a material of these are
these are a little bit around my waist
I'm where I want to put the mat for 6
but I just love them so much I love the
color the stores or not and I think not
waste weapons but funnily enough I only
picked up one accessory and that is this
up here now once I saw this I literally
taking my eyes off it
I love the goji telling I love how these
are the holes for the belt Islam expense
and I also love how many holes it has
you can adjust it to fit your waist or
your hips and it's a bit a lot of sizes
but I think this part is so cool and so
edgy and I love it I can't wait to start
wearing it because it's awesome and we
answer the last things I picked up are
three pairs of bikinis because pretty
much in Australia it is summer all year
round even when it's winter on
it's okay it really fricking hot so a
lot of bikinis is a must in Australia
for the best path up is just maybe
triangle bikini and it's got what style
delivered I'm sure you guys Mary I was
freaking obsessive stop so when I pull
this bikini I definitely have to get it
I love the Navy because I don't own any
bikinis on the Navy and I just love how
it's like a really simple bikini top and
then this is the matching buttons
they're so cute but they're a little bit
cheeky I don't know how I feel about
cheesy bottoms just go to work on my
breeding and then I might be fine and
then the next pair I picked up our
offering sauce as well because I'm
obsessed so this is what the top looks
like it is just baby thing and it's but
it's really pretty like I was very
missing detailing around the outside I
don't know how to surprise that but the
fact is looks like crisscross and I love
the color because every guys know baby
pink is one of my favorite colors and
then this is the bottoms they do look
quite high waisted off women are on but
they're not actually estimate like on
the hips but I like to kind of wear them
like that so they kind of fit like
openly it's a little bit more but I
absolutely love these I think the design
is going on any lobster or bikinis I
picked up I actually don't have the top
with me because I wore it as a bra late
yesterday and it's not showing up on the
screen here what it looks like these are
so nice there's a simple black basic
bikinis the bottoms are really really
high waisted and the top is so comfy it
has no lining at all and as I said I did
wear the top a pilot because it is that
comfy and it's so nice and so simple and
I think it's just a really good black
basic piece but knowing how it that is
everything that I think that some white
folks critique I really don't you guys
