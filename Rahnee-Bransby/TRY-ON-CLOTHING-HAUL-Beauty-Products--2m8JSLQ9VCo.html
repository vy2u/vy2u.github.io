my channel so today I'm bringing you yet
another clothing hole I have been
pumping these cleansing little snot like
crazy I don't know why honestly it is
just because I've been getting so many
clothes lately the addiction is grew I
really hope you guys aren't getting sick
of like closing holes because I am
bringing you to this week I really saw
if you don't like them but I know most
of you guys do you like them so yeah
everything I picked up in this hole is
from my one and only favorite Australian
fruity princess Polly is haul it's
actually quite exciting because I have a
lot of beauty products to show you guys
so I have a few plays a few accessories
and a lot of beading products and as you
guys know I never do a clothing haul
without hooking you guys up with a
discount code so if you want to say
about 20% off your next purchase with
the princess Polly use the code
Rani Polly and that is maybe 20% off as
I just said I feel like I'm throwing so
much information into one intro but
lastly some of the clothes I had iPad
for the past few weeks sorry you've
probably seen them in some photos by
thought I'd throw them in there anyway
but let's just jump right into it and I
really hope you guys enjoy so let's
start off with the clothing items I have
three dresses to show you guys so the
first one is this one Kiki okay this is
just a black mini dress with a black
matte sequins all over it and that is
the tongue tied to say I think this
dress is so cool it is seriously right
up my alley
I do find this dress a little bit cheeky
so when I do wear it out I do our top
under it starting thing is with this
dress you have to be very happy because
it is sorry delicate because of the
material and
sequence but I honestly think this is
the definition of a potty dress and it
is seriously so creamy and so cool the
next item I picked up is this black
denim look dress I find this dress is so
cute because I have a little peplum at
the bottom when I first saw her I wasn't
too sure about it because these sorts of
dresses don't really suit me that much I
think this would look so cool in the
Taoiseach underneath or even a
see-through needed jumper over the top
in the wintertime but yeah I just love
how girly this is but it also gives off
like an edgy vibe at the same time maybe
on two tops I picked up this Bell long
sleeve top I think this top is so cool
and so flattering on like when I wear it
I literally feel like I look so good I
absolutely love the longer huge
birthplace of this shirt and the fabric
of it is actually a checkered pattern I
don't know if the camera will pick it up
but if you look closely it has like a
little black check ins all over it the
next top I picked up is this little crop
here when I saw this I fell in love with
this because it reminds me of Sonic from
the 70s I love the red and white on the
top I think it is very pretty it also
has a little tire on the way so you can
tie it at the front or at the back
however you want but when I saw this
shot I pictured it with a pair of brown
high-waisted suede pants light flared
pants and I thought it would book the
sorcerer cool so I have to get it oh so
it's a little bit different to what I
usually wear but lately I've been really
into floral and patent clothing I don't
know why there's something about it the
next time I picked up I'm sure you guys
have seen before in my Instagram it is
this red and white a starry long-sleeve
now this is totally a roni top like I
feel like this is me in a top I think it
is source or key and it kind of reminds
me of a circus for some reason I think
it's just like the style of it it's got
these really cute ruffles around the
chest area and it goes along the back
and it also has them around the neck
area I think this would look awesome
with a high waisted pair of mom jeans
and even left or even with the bra lay
underneath a light tied up with the bra
line underneath like anyone looks so
cool but I don't earn anything like this
and I wish
it is so cool any last piece of clothing
I picked up is this little brown a
corduroy disco sorry it's just a brown
corduroy it's good with great lace
detailing out the front I feel like with
these goats you can never go wrong and I
feel like everyone needs a skirt like
this they go with everything in this so
flattering and so comfortable it's on it
once again gives me a 70s vibe now
moving on to accessories I picked up
three little simple accessories now when
I say little and simple I literally mean
tiny and simple but necessary cute so
the first piece of jewelry I picked up
is this little bit of septum piercing
now I show you guys to know you like
ages back I used to wear septum piercing
all the time but all the ones I got
broke so I haven't got one in so long
but this one is so cute
so this one I got I think is perfect for
every day because it is not crazy big or
like dramatic like my other ones I've
worn it is really simple and small you
know how sometimes septum piercings can
be really distracting because they're so
big and bulky I think this one is just
super simple and cute the next week
surgery I picked up in these earrings
I'm wearing now these are freaking
adorable I have to say that when I do to
get them I honestly thought they were
going to be like really really big but
they came up through and tiny this style
of earrings are the ones that you just
pull through your ear so you can have
them really short or you can have them
quite long and the thing I find really
cool about these earrings as well is one
is the lightning bolt and one is a star
makes true favorite things but I also
think these are perfect for everyday
wear as well because they're not crazy
and dramatic they're just super cute and
dainty and pretty
and jelly he lost her earring psychic
stuff and these lumps here once again I
thought these ones were gonna be really
big but they ended up being really small
so they are just these little
upside-down half triangles with a little
turquoise starting in the middle is that
so pretty I'm so delicate I really
really love these ones and I feel like
these are going to be a pair of earrings
that I wear every day is just like an
everyday piece of jewelry as I said a
million times now the really cool thing
about princess Polly is say sell a lot
of beauty products that you can actually
pick up in Australia so if you are
Australian any are looking for certain
types of brands like Becca and Geoffrey
star stuff like that that you can't
really get your hands on because
shipping is a pain in the up and
literally cost your soul princess Holly
it's a place to go so all the products I
have to show you guys are from Jeffrey
star now I know I have to quickly
address this because I have said it in a
past video I'm not the biggest fan of
Jeffrey star but I do freakin love his
products I think they are incredible
so because Jeffrey star product is the
Geoffrey start skin frost in the shade
at page goddess now this highlighter is
seriously it's stunning it's such a
perfect color for everyday wear even
though it is peachy it is still very
wearable it kinda reminds me of the
eyeshadow shade at champagne truffle in
the chocolate bar factor in the
chocolate-bar Factory oh my god in a
chocolate bar palette by Too Faced these
highlighters are seriously crazy
pigmented and they're so nice on the
skin yeah this is a highlighting color I
wouldn't usually lean towards why I've
been absolutely loving it the next thing
I picked up up for the lower liquid
lipsticks now these are my absolute
favorite liquid lipsticks I love how
they stay on the list and the formula of
them and they're very long-lasting as
well so the shades I got out of so
swatch them for you guys in the shade I
am nude and now this is just like a very
pale nude shade I don't like to wear
this one on my own because it is too
pale for my skin tone so it kind of
looks like eye concealer lips but I do
like to blend this in with other shades
like today I'm wearing it on the center
of my lips and then I have the train at
Gemini now this
reminds me of the shade taupe by Mac but
obviously inner liquid lipstick oh hello
once again I have this on the outer
corners of my lips this shade is perfect
for an everyday way and I think a
compliment every single skin tone then I
have one of my favorite shades
this is posh spice now this is also a
very popular shade by Jeffrey stop this
is kind of like a gray tone to nude and
I just love that I think Peters story so
cool and lastly I have a shade that
wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea but I
really wanted to get it because it is so
groovy and I really want to do a cool
makeup tutorial with it it is the shade
it's dirty money now this is like a
coffee green colored liquid lipstick
obviously not everyone's cup of tea but
I think it is so cool and I literally
love it on the lips but I don't if I'd
ever have the balls to wear it out but
maybe to a festival and obably last
three things but be whole and the last
three products I'd to share with you
guys these are the jeffree star lip and
vision lipsticks I'm pretty sure that's
what they are the first shade I got is a
very popular unicorn blood now when I
tried this on I actually fell in love
with Brits again I don't really wear red
I really only snoop around nudes but
this is such a beautiful shade it's like
a really dark rich red and I can't wait
to film a tutorial using this the next
shade I picked up is X supermodel now
this kind of mines do like a dusty rose
pink but I don't know how I feel about
pink on me I don't think it suits you
very well but it'll be fun to play
around with and the next shade is
another shade that I'm not too sure
about on my list because I don't think
it suits me very well but this is ice
cream Boulevard but this is just like a
very bright pastel Bobby paint but I
honestly think this would look
incredible on top skin tone so I think
it would look so cool so that is
everything I picked up from princess
Polly I really hope you guys enjoyed
