my channel so today I thought I would
mix things up a little bit and do a
little bit more of a different makeup
tutorial if any of you guys follow me on
Instagram or snapchat or if the vlog has
been uploaded yet you would know that my
co just did my makeup for a master class
that he had here in Perth I will leave a
photo of the makeup here I'm very funny
when it comes to makeup I like to do
only one look or like a few specific
looks that I alternate between I don't
like to change it up a little bit
because I pretty much like saying and
what I'm comfortable in and after my
husband my makeup he did such an amazing
job and I fell in love with it and I was
so obsessed so I thought I should start
mixing it up a little bit and trying
different books on myself and subbing
out my comforts aren't a little bit I
always step out of my comfort zone with
fashion so why not do it with makeup so
today I teamed up with a rumor London on
this video I'm sure you guys know that I
worked with it room London
so much in the past like two years I've
done a TV commercial with them I've done
multiple videos honestly I've done so
much with the rule they are one of my
favorite brands and I'm so excited to be
working with them again
so this time we are working on a series
called at trend a drop and the trend for
this month is floating liner which I'm
so excited about because I've seen this
floating line our trends are floating
around so when I did that for a while
now and I honestly think it is so
freaking cool it's like really on my
Ally sorry I created two looks today in
this video and edgy one and a more
wearable one this is the wearable one
here this is honestly my favorite I love
how these turned out so if you guys
would like to see the two looks that I
showed at the start of the video then
please keep on watching and let's just
jump straight into it
so I've already done my base and I'm
going to have my base down for both that
makeup looks because this makeup
tutorial is purely based on the eyes and
I'll show you guys what I'm doing with
the eyes and I'm also going to do a lip
as well so it's just going to be eyes
and lips that I'm showing you today but
I did use all Rimmel London products on
my face and I believe the names of what
I used on my face down below if you want
to know like what foundation I'm wearing
or what highlighter stuff like that
so the first look I'm going to show you
guys is an attainable look so more of a
turn down everyday look so this one I
was actually just practicing before and
I freaking love it
like it's just so cool I've never really
done anything like this I'm starting
with the magnifies eye primer and going
to prime at my eyelids this is so
important because it just makes the
eyeshadow stay on longer and also
intensifies the eyeshadow and it's also
waterproof and last up to 24 hours as
well so that's a plus intercept that
actually base I'm taking the magnifiers
nude edition eyes shadow palette and I'm
just going to be taking at this sand
brown shade and I'm going to apply that
all over the lid up to my brow bone
because this is more of a wearable look
this will be the only eye shadow I do
now for the fun part I'm taking the 24
hour color precision eyeliner in the
shade white and I'm just going to start
by feathering the pen along my crease
and doing a really thin wing this liner
is sorry easy to use because I have such
a fine point and also for a white liquid
liner this is very pigmented so I just
started at the inner corner above my
crease and I slowly just started to
follow my crease and lightly feather
this out and then once I did that side I
went ahead into the other side sorry I
pretty much just looked directly in the
mirror and it mapped out and tried to
get it the exact same on the other side
now I'm going in with the scandalize
extreme mascara and I'm just going to do
a light coat of this to my top and
bottom lashes this is one of my favorite
mis cars and the cool thing is the wand
actually has a flat side and a curved
side so the kind of a side of the one
volumizes and also it loads up the
lashes for a really extreme look and the
flat side it defines and lengthens the
lashes from the root to tube
for the very last step which is lips I'm
taking the stay matte liquid lipstick in
the shade mica and I'm just going to
apply this all over my lips as you guys
know these liquid lipsticks on my
ultimate favorite I've done so many
videos using these so yeah and then once
the lips are done at this is the first
look completed moving on to the second
look I have these same base on and I've
already gone ahead and apprised my eyes
and set them just because you guys saw
me do that in the first look so I
thought I would just skip that step for
this one so this look is going to be the
more edgy look and I'm really excited
about this one because by using color by
the way I just took a photo of the first
look and I freaking love it so cool I'm
gonna start by taking the color
precision liquid liner again and this is
in the blue shade I'm gonna start by
doing a floating wing again above my
crease but this time I'm only gonna do
it on the outer half of my eye I'm gonna
stop the wing where the eyebrow ends and
I'm gonna bring that in halfway through
to my crease then I went ahead and
joined the tip of that wing to the outer
corner of my lashline I'm just going in
with the color precision liner in white
again and I'm just going to add a tiny
little line under the bottom line that
connects to the lash line just because I
thought this would look cool and make it
a little bit more fun
now I'm taking the magnifiers at color
Edition eyeshadow palette and I'm going
to take this rich gold shade and apply
this to my inner corner just to add a
little bit more color going back in with
the scandalize mascara again I'm going
to apply this to my top and bottom
lashes why not go all out to finish off
with lips I'm taking it the stay matte
liquid lip color in the shade blue iris
and this is the navy blue and I'm just
going to put this on and then that will
be the finished look so I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video I know it
was a little bit different but I like
filming at different videos because the
Kate's motivated and it's just a lot
more fun I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will see you very soon
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
