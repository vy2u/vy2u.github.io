back to my channel so today I'm battling
with the worst hay fever I feel like
every time I go to film a video
something happens to me and today it is
hay fever so today I have another
triumph clothing haul for you guys
my last clothing haul dudes so freaking
well I cannot believe it's like thank
you so much for the feedback on that
video I absolutely love doing these
videos but you guys love watching them
and so I'm just going to jump straight
into it today I really hope you enjoy
and let's go so yesterday I received the
biggest package eyes ever seats in the
mail from an online clothing store
called naked now I'm sure all of you
have heard me rave about this tool this
saw is one of my favorite online
clothing so they cater for everyone and
they have everything so that's why I
love them so much so I have a heck of a
lot of ideas to show you guys but I'm
actually going to split this haul into
true I went to do half of it on my
youtube channel here now and the other
half on my snapchat so be sure to you
add me on it such help with the username
Ronnie or scare this little ghost here
because you won't want to miss that
that'll probably be out sometime it
makes face so yeah I've also heard you
guys up with a rocking discount card I
will leave on the screen here and it
leave a link below so be sure you head
over to naked check out the clothes and
purchase a few things and use my
discount card because you'll be saving a
few bucks I have quite a lot of items to
show you guys so let's go I'm going to
quickly start off with what I'm wearing
can we just take a moment for this dress
this dress is so beautiful it is just
like a dusty or a slip dress and it was
like ties up at the side so it's like a
red dress I know a lot of rap justice
are in at the moment but I absolutely
love this one but I love the color it is
to die for and I got this because I
never have anything really nice or
really dressy to wear when I go out to
events I literally I'm always running
around last-minute being like what the
hell do I wear because all my clothes
are casual so I decided to pick this one
arts just in case I haven't been coming
up and I want something that's super
nice and classy to wear speaking of
addresses the next dress I got it
this beautiful gray black and white
striped dress I love the cutout at the
top it kind of has like that traitor
look to it and it moving down the dress
it also has these huge pockets on the
bottom of the dress now I got this
because once again I have very really
nice dressy clothes all my clothing
really casual so I kind of but when I
buy a lot of things that were quite
dressy for Sunday specials and it's
summer it's coming up in Australia so I
really wanted to get a few really nice
things like um it's like Sunday's lashes
and stuff like that but this dress is so
beautiful when I first saw it on their
website I quickly skim past and I was
like not for me then I went back up and
I did another look and I was like okay I
think I love it and then I tried it on
and I'll say it not this dress is to die
for
I absolutely loved it so much it is
definitely one of my favorite dresses
and the last dress I got is this little
light gray slip one here now the thing I
love about this is to actually do it
aren't you tired these straps like right
over your shoulders I think it just adds
a really cute touch but I don't have any
simple slip dresses and I love with the
color of this one so I thought this
would be perfect for the springtime
maybe I'm just moving on to peaches I
was about to say moving on to the page
maybe now's your chance I picked up this
adorable dark peach cami I think this
one out because I loved the color of it
there's something about that dark peach
like dusty pink shade that I've been
loving at the moment and he is just such
a gorgeous top you can either wave
really dressy or really casual and I
think it's so cute the next thing I
picked up is this turtleneck here first
of all this has glitter all over I'm not
sure if the camera will pick it up but
it's full of glitter and I freaking love
it because anything glitter is like me
it's like made for me the thing I love
about this turtleneck it is super thin
material it is kind of see-through so
you do have to wear a bra under this and
it is a long sleeve as well so it's
going to be perfect to wear at night
time through the spring and summertime
it's kind of the shape of a box T if you
get what I mean it kind of has that like
boxy shape to it
I just love it I think it's so different
and I don't have a turtleneck that is
like this and the glitter is totally
attracted me to it this thing I picked
up is a turtleneck sweater
now you're probably
King Ronnie winters over and done with
but I have it the biggest thing for
country clothes I love wearing comfy
clothes all I live in it it's like
tights and jumpers and like t-shirt
dresses I literally love copy clothes
nothing better so it is just this great
home next letter here the feel of this
oh my god I cannot even explain it is so
soft and it's so thick and so wooly I
love the material of this it is
seriously it's so soft and I put it on
yesterday and boy I didn't want to take
it off food but I just love this it is
so comfy and I seriously cannot wait to
wear it every single day in my life now
I don't know why I actually got quite a
few jumpers and we're going into summer
like which is long gone I hate winter I
don't know why I got so many jumpers but
it is that thing where I love conference
so the next thing I got is this dark
navy blue um Calvin Klein jump up sorry
I got this jumper just for the same
reason just to throw in if I want to go
jump to the shops or something or if I
just feel like lounging around a coffee
clothes yeah it just has a carbon fiber
logo on the front super basic super
comfy but I love it so then I picked up
a few brothers now I don't know if any
of you know about I don't have the
biggest boots in the world I have really
small boobs sorry I don't actually wear
bras I haven't worn a bra for about a
year and a half almost three years or
something sorry I don't like wearing
bras I hate them they're so
uncomfortable they do nothing for me
because I'm their boobs so I live in bra
let's that's all I wear so either no bra
or bra so the first one I got is
probably one of the confidence ones IRA
it is just a simple gray at Calvin Klein
one now I know Shaunie always lives in
her so I was like is it really
comfortable like I want to get one
because she always wears it so I decided
to get one and now I see why she was
worse but it seriously hands down one of
the company's products I've ever owned
it's not true tired or anything it's not
very restricting it's just super comfy
now the next one I picked up is another
one of my new favorites now this one I
feel like has really good support even
though I don't need support because I
don't have boobs sometimes girls with
really big boobs can't wear bras because
they don't really support or anything
but the shape of this one I feel like
would to support really well sorry it is
just this plain at black bra like here
now the reason why I think it's a poor
well and it sits really well on as well
how many times can I say well it's
because it has this little loop at the
bottom and it really just pulls
everything in and kind of holds it in
better this one covers everything and I
just loved it it was so comfy and it's
so pretty now the next one is completely
see-through so I'm not going to show
this one on but it is this really
freaking beautiful white roll it here it
kind of like froze like the bottom which
has a really cool effect and look to it
but it's just sorry elegant is so pretty
I don't know many white violets but I
think this one is perfect because it'll
make me look so cute and and yeah I knew
last brother I got is kind of like
another sporty look one it is just this
black one here I love the bottom of this
one it has white black and pink stripes
this one is super good to wear under
quotes because it is not see-through at
all so you're not going to see anything
I just kind of love their lights 45
Icahn's
maybe on two bottoms I already have a
pair of very similar to this and I don't
know why I always buy things that are
the exact same for some reason they are
just these dark black wash lay my shorts
so I love the bottoms of these have a
fray I love shorts like that they kind
of you guys like the literature they
kind of give that like vintage look to
it
they're pretty simple just like black
ripped jeans and they have to Levi logo
on the back but they are cool so I'd be
done with these jeans by the brand at
shape Monday and then you just don't
know the white pair of jeans now these
aren't super highways these kind of sit
just below the belly button which is
kind of annoying but I can just like
yank them up get a bit of a camel toe
but you're gonna do what I do but I just
love like the boyfriend mum look of
these I kind of had that really baggy
feels for them and yeah my last pair of
buttons I got is a pair of yoga pants or
gym leggings
once again I freaking love gym leggings
so happens office store me black navy
blue shade it has this pattern on her
I'm not sure how to explain it's kind of
like scratches of color or like
but I have no idea I really don't know
but you guys can see what I'm talking
about but these are the comfiest and
most flattering leggings I've ever owned
I earned a lot of jean leggings but
these are by far my favorite I plan to
make your legs look really turned in a
weird way but they're so flattering and
so nice oh I forgot to take the tie off
and I've already won the hell out of
these and I really happen for a day
three more items to go and the next
thing I picked up it's a pair of bikinis
now I loved the look of these on the
model online because I've never really
seen bikinis like these so they are
these black strapless bikinis here and
they kind of have a really cool light
away the effect for them it kinda
reminds me of like a mermaid bikini for
some reason like the shape of it I feel
like this is not a mermaid mood where
the early downside is they do have cuffs
in them and I hate wearing bikinis that
have like the bra cup thing sorry I'm
going to get my auntie tree on stitch to
take them out and research it I think
and then the bottoms are the same they
just had that really like cool wavy kind
of curly affects them next thing I
picked up is a pair of shoes now I'm
showing you ordinary I'm obsessed with
boots I have so many foods it is
ridiculous but I don't have anything
like these so I decided to pick these up
I love briefs I have like the mesh panel
on the side so they just have a really
gorgeous fake snake pattern on them I
love the pattern of this I don't own
boots that have this pattern at all so I
really don't know what I'm about silent
these are so flattering on and they look
so nice and they kind of give that
classy feel I know I do have a lot of
boots and that I went of festivals and
when I wear them up would you know or
wear them out in general it kind of like
makes them look a lot more casual
because the roots are so worn out so I
feel like I'm really gonna wear these
for special occasions or when I go out
for dinner or more classy more dressy
event boy oh boy it doesn't matter right
Brad's equating or without a pair of
sunglasses I'm addicted guys I really am
so the next thing I picked up is a pair
of sunglasses and they're these ones
here these are by the brand respect one
of my favorite sunglass
one of my favorite sunglasses friends
and they have such good quality
sunglasses and they are just so nice I
love the exams are nice on such good
quality feels so nice on and I love how
the lenses are Royce code I think that's
so cool but you ends up with the last
thing that I picked up that I'm sharing
with you guys in this hole is this neck
place I'm wearing I thought I would
share it with you guys because I have it
on I also really love this because it's
kind of like cross between edgy but
elegant so it's just this really nice
thing at 10 China and has a circle in
the middle but I love this it is so
simple and it's kind of like that edgy
classy look that I was trying to explain
so nice of the clearance I'm going to be
sharing with you guys today in this hole

mess with the other half of the whole
tree sometime in next week's thank you
