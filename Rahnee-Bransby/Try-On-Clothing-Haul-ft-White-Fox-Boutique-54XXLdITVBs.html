my channel so today I have another
craving haul for you guys I hope you
guys not getting sick of these I
absolutely love and weenies
they definitely my favorite to film and
you guys are watching them and they're
like my most viewed videos on my channel
so I'm coming back out - oh there's
another one today so today's the
clothing haul is the super exciting one
because it is in collaboration with an
online clothing store here in Australia
called white box boutique and they have
a bunch of really nice going out and
dressy clothes store as somebody's
coming up I really need a Josie quiz
because all my clothes are casual as I
said in my last hole I'm seriously iron
or in casual clothes sorry I have a few
more dressier things today that I picked
up from white pants boutique and let's
jump right into it so let's start off
with an 8 bodysuit now as I said all
these clothes are look dressy and a lot
different to what I usually wear which I
really like because I like experimenting
that with different clothes because
literally as by status thousand times
all of my clothes are casual so the
first one is this white off the shoulder
of body 3 as soon as I saw this I
thought this would be perfect for night
out or day out somewhere where you need
to be a little bit more dressier sorry
it's just a folded off the shoulder
white and body 3 I really like the whole
folded on effect I think it's so cool I
also really like
20 speakers over one arm I've never
really seen a sight that before and it
is also you're really nice to it as well
it kind of like stops everything in but
I will say that if you are wanting to
purchase this I would go a size up I'm
usually a size six and I got this in a
size six and it does kind of hug my body
a little bit screw-type so yeah if you
are wanting to purchase this I do
recommend going a size up but the next
thing I fix up is the top now this is
going to be a bit hard to hold up and
show you guys so I'll try my best but
you'll feel on the Tryon pod it is just
a really gorgeous rose gold shirt it
kind of has like a copper I'm just
trying in a weird way it kind of looks
pop out a little bit the thing I love
about this is the sleeves a quiet flowy
and they actually go really tight at the
end where you button them up but I was
home alone and I could get any ones to
broaden it up for me in a triangle so it
was really hard to do it sorry I just
left them I'm done once again the
material of this is really nice it
almost feels like a scoop material it is
slicing and such good quality I love how
you can wear a bra under this and you
can have it like kind of take you
through so yeah that's the second thing
I got the next thing I picked up is this
gorgeous dress here now this is kind of
like a champagne e
pinkish shade do you know what this
shade reminds me of reminds me of the
it's a champagne truffle in the
chocolate bar palette I think that's a
shade of it but it reminds me of that
Shay for some reason but it is just this
beautiful like dusty pink champagne
dress the thing I absolutely love about
this dress is in the front it kind of
like all cinches and comes together I
don't really know how to explain it but
it's kind of like twelve into one not if
that makes sense
it's just got an open at front so you
can show a little bit of cleavage but if
you have no boots like me then you'll
just be showing skin their material of
this again is kind of like that silk
feel it kind of feels like silky but it
is such a thin material which I think
will be perfect for summer because as it
is long-sleeved it might get a bit hot
but wearing this at nighttime in summer
will be perfect because
it isn't thick and it's quite thin sorry
I don't think you'll get too hot in that
if I in my pick top is another dress now
this is a little bit different to what I
usually wear but I think it's like the
gold glitter that drew me to it it is
this gorgeous gold specular dress now oh
my God look how gold it is it's just
like literally the color of it and all
the sparkles just literally like makes
me so excited we have this rope
detailing at the front where you can tie
it to make it a little bit more shaped
and like sitting at your waist because
this is quite like a straight dress I
think this is perfect to add a bit more
shape into the dress this please and the
back of the dress is actually see
through it as well which I love the
sleeves on this I think that's so cool
they kind of remind me of a gypsy like a
gypsy cost you mean you know how the
sleeves I really like baggy and then go
tied at the end but I just think this is
so pretty and so girly and so fun I love
the color once again because it is
sparkly I love anything like glittery
little sparkly of gold and the last item
of clothing that I picked up that I have
to share with you guys is the pair of
jeans now I have these for about a week
and I've worn the absolute hell out of
these I love these jeans sorry mom today
I just think white tight jeans and they
have these really big rips in the knees
I literally love ripped jeans they are
my favorite pair of jeans ever I don't
own any white tie chain so when I saw
these I really wanted to get them
because I feel like white jeans go
really well with a lot of things I love
the look of wearing white jeans in
summer especially in the nighttime
because they just make it look so much
more Chad and I feel like they make you
look a lot more slimmer as well and I
love the roots in the days can we just
talk about that like you know sometimes
when you get jeans and the cut the RIP
is like a tiny little slit or the rip is
too big they're not like too big or too
small they're just perfect I've
literally been loving wearing these
lately and I think I wear these till the
day they die moving on the next thing I
picked up from white folks boutique is a
pair of shoes and they have just these
brown
tie up heeled shoes here now I love
these because the heel isn't too high my
feet get so sore in a big Hills
I don't really like to wear heels
because my feet
and then it ruins my mood and then I
want to go home sorry I think this will
be perfect for the summer because
they're not a huge Hill so if I'm going
to be wearing them all day or all night
my feet I'm going to get sore I love the
color of them they're just like a camel
tan a color and I love how these can't I
like all the way up your ankle and I
also love how open they are I feel like
in summer it is hard to find a good heel
because your feet tend to get really
sweaty like the ones the K shoes I don't
know if you notice something about that
but they kind of have like the material
on the outside and the lacing down the
top if that makes sense
they get sorry freaking sweaty in some
are like my feet so my hip like crazy in
them I can see myself getting a lot of
wear out of these the next thing I
picked off a treat bags now the first
one it can we just have like true second
silence for this bag oh my god festival
the color of this bag is so beautiful
it's kind of like a stoner really like
grey it's not kind of reminds me of
those little miniature backpacks but you
wear out on this side it's like a
shoulder bag and I also love the tassels
on it especially because one side
they're great and one side they're white
so they aren't like a really cool touch
considering how little this bag is it's
got so much room it's got the actual bag
itself and then it's got a zip in the
bag and on the back it's got a little
pocket as well which i think is going to
be perfect just to put your phone in
because I'm one of those people that
can't be rather than holding their
phones and they keep putting it in their
bag but then they want it in their hand
every second so I'm like in and out in
and out all the time opening up my bags
so this is perfect because you don't
have to actually open up the bag and
take three you can just chuck it in the
back but I thought this would be perfect
for music festivals and the last bag I
picked up I think would be perfect for
music festivals as well and it is just a
plain black bag I don't own any playing
black bag so thing I really like about
this bag is you on it clip it here and
then you unzip the zip sorry it makes it
look a lot more smaller than it is but
it actually is such a big bag there's so
much room in there yeah this is another
bag I think will be perfect for a night
out or a festival as well
that have that tousled feel there are
anything that confuses me about is bad
is I don't really know how the strap go
it's like does it go across like that
like does it does anyone have this
bagging in tell me how the strap goes
because it's got like a double strap so
I just put the second strap down there
but I'm not sure if that's right
sorry I've got three more things to show
you guys and they are all accessories
the first one is this gorgeous trim here
so this is just like a library check in
with a little tassel on it I've got a
thing for tassels in this hall as you
can tell I absolutely love chokers they
definitely spice up a whole outfit and I
think this one is the cutest little
thing I've ever seen I love the little
tassel on it the next accessory I got
are these banging earrings can we just
take a moment these are seriously sorry
freaking and stunning they are just
these star earrings the top star that
actually goes into your ear is black and
then the one at the bottom is this huge
superstar I absolutely love these
earrings I think there's such a
statement piece because of the star is
so big and like just look how cool they
are they are seriously so freaking cool
I'm obsessed with them when I put these
in I seriously couldn't stop looking at
myself because I'm like holy how these
earrings are so cool I think they're one
of my new favorites I'm definitely
obsessed with them any last accessory
that I picked up of course it's a pair
of sunglasses it is not a Ronnie Pole
without a pair of sunglasses but
unfortunately I left them at Breda and
certain quickly you're just going to do
a little overlay of them here so that is
everything that I picked up for this
whole I really hope you guys enjoyed it
I had so much fun filming it because I
love doing these clothes once again I
have a hoody does up with the rocking
discount card so I'll leave it on the
screen and down Valerie I really hope
