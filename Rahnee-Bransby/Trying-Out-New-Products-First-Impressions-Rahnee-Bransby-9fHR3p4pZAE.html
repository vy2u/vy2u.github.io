my channel so today I wanted to film
kind of like a try out new products
first impressions that get ready with me
so I sat down had a chat with you guys
and tried out a bunch of new products
that I received in the mail or I bought
myself because I've had them but sitting
in a box in my room for the longest time
now so I thought it was time to try them
out and this is new makeup look I came
up with it's something a little bit
different to what I usually lean towards
so if you guys would like to see me at
try out some new products and chat to
you guys about random things and how I
recreated this look then please keep on
watching and let's jump straight into it
sorry I'm not sure if you guys can tell
if you probably can't but I've got a lot
of new furniture I couldn't read desc
and I got a new makeup drawers and
makeup storage so my background is
looking a little bit different it just
looks a lot more spacious I feel like
there's a lot more space last time I was
sorry
zoomed up into the camera and my
background was kind of like so cluttered
because my desk was so small but I got a
bigger one and I'm obsessed with it it
literally took me five and a half hours
to frickin build it and that is kind of
hot the reason why I stopped filming for
so long I just lost so much motivation
because I was not happy with my
background at all and just filming with
a background that I wasn't happy with
really unmotivated me for some weird
reason I don't know why but I finally
have me found a challenge this bad boy
is going soon I'm decking out my homey
background I just saw over it I love
change and I hate when things stay the
same I'm so done with the plan so don't
worry this room would be plants a mini
background but I'm gonna get rid of this
I think it's just a little bit too much
now so also you guys are probably like
Ronnie I don't care why you telling me
this but the reason why I am telling you
this is because I got a new makeup
storage so I got such a big cabinet for
my makeup so going before I have this
tiny little cabinet and I got sent so
much makeup and I've even buy so much
makeup that all my rent was living in
boxes or my new makeup that I wasn't
like ready to experiment with
just living in boxes and I was getting
so annoyed because I was just using the
same products all the time and now I
have it so many fun products to play
with I am so much new stuff to it mess
around with so that's why today I'm kind
of filming your first impressions like
trying out new products video and let me
show you I am so freaking excited so
let's just show them it straight into it
starting out with primer I have so many
primers but the one I'm going to try out
today is the Smashbox photo-finish of
primal wound up I'm obsessed
we'd like face sprays like anything to
do with like words water setting sprays
beaks claws I'm seriously obsessed with
sorry I'm so excited to keep this alert
I think that was too much now I don't
have any meat foundations but I haven't
used this one in the longest time so I'm
going to be using the unique mineral
touch foundation in English a toughie
tell the really cool thing about this
foundation oh my god oh my god I
seriously thought I wasn't filming then
the really cool thing about this
foundation is the like applicator is
like a little drop off it's I love it
it's so easy okay you know what I'm just
gonna go in for the kill
sorry if any of you guys follow me on
snapchat

I'm always snapchatting I have had a
weird obsession lately with gym clothes
oh it's not really weird because I've
just recently gotten back into the gym
and working out and eating healthy and
stuff I used to be crazy gym fanatic as
weird as that sounds I used to guard all
the time when I was in school and then I
graduated and just stopped going and I
didn't necessarily put on white I just
lost all my muscle and I got really
insecure so I started again before
summer
I've been going really hard for about
three months now and my results are
crazy some people might not even see the
results but I do because obviously I
look at my body like every single day so
I really want to feel my workout routine
to help you guys I love motivating and
helping people anything to do with
helping people I love I have that many
workout clothes right now it's
ridiculous like what even are normal

beside the rest of my face I'm of course
taking my Australian specialist pressed
powder in the shade caucus proud
moving into the brows a lot of people
it's asked me why do you always jump up
comer to fill in your brows when they
come back and I suppose it just saves
time I don't want you guys sitting there
watching me feel like my brows when it
takes quite a while and I also just
operated at brow routine I'll leave that
links below if you wanna check it out so
I'll be back in two seconds now I'm just
going to go ahead and contour my face
with the hoola benefit bronzer
now sighs I have to serve many eyeshadow
palettes to play with like so many but I
have a 3d hand that I want to show you
guys by the way this is not so much that
I just think the idea of these is so
freakin cute so I received three of
these Christmas edition Too Faced
palettes in the mail and oh my god I'm
obsessed with them like I think they are
the cutest things ever to show you guys
the packaging like look how cute that it
you have the gingerbread cookie one and
then we have a eggnog latte I'm obsessed
with the packaging on this one I think
it is so cute and then lastly we have
the peppermint mocha was also the shades
and these are amazing and they smell
exactly what they say like this smells
like gingerbread and then this is the
eggnog latte one and it smells like
eggnog is the peppermint mocha man they
are just sorry freaking cute and I'm so
excited for Christmas I love Christmas
so much sorry I think I'm going to use
the eggnog last one today because it has
this gorgeous like a dark gray shade in
there and I fell in love edition as soon
as I saw it and I really wanted to
create a look using that do you guys
sorry that was really weird
you guys always ask me to do it that was
really rude once again you guys always
ask me to sue me in when I do my
eyeshadow so I'll start doing that from
now on I'm going to start out with the
pretty fun and fearless CIT London exit
Chloe Morello palette i recessed on this
fella i just recently got it and it is
beautiful going to take the shade
unconditional and just apply that
through my grades
now I'm going in with the shade at
Central Park which is just like Mozy and
B green color and I'm going to start
lightly blending that on my out of me
and my inner corners
this is why I wanted to do my concealer
fast because that's a bit of full Wow
oh well just work with it
now I'm taking the show you to coal
debris and I'm going to apply that on
the center of my lid now I'm just going
in with that green shade again and I'm
going to blend that along my lower lash
line
sorry I've just gone ahead and applied
some lashes and some mascara
these are the demi whispies I'm pretty
sure by Adele after you have bronzed up
at the skin I'm taking the Milani baked
bronzer in the shade golden and I'm just
going to apply this on the outer parts
of my face just to bronze out the skin
and give it a little bit of warmth
I miss y'all so now is taking the shade
frosty dog I forgive I love that name
and I'm just going to apply this on my
brother - hi
now I'm just going in with the shade
eggnog latte and this is like a gorgeous
champagne shade it is seriously so
beautiful I think I'm gonna do a golden
kind of champagne smokey eye notes for
this palette so now I'm just gonna take
this and put this on my inner corners to
highlight
that's we highlight the rest of my face
I'm taking the Evan Takei and they can
illuminated a Traer the shades in here

I'm going to use a mixture of these two
here

something nude because the eyes are so
heavy I'm going to be taking the ofra
liquid lipstick in the shade sell Apollo
I think I'm pretty sure I've butchered
that but what about
