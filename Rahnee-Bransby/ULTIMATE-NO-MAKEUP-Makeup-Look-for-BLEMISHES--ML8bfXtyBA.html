to my channel so I have no makeup on
right now and that is because today I
wanted to sit down and film the ultimate
no makeup makeup look as you can see I
do have a few blemishes at the moment I
have one here I have them here here on
my lips that's random one here with that
being said I wanted to cater this video
for people that do have blemishes or
acne prone skin because I have seen
these videos all over YouTube and
everyone that Jocelyn has amazing skin
and honestly they are so lucky half the
time my skin is pretty clear but
everyone goes through those stages or
those days or weeks where they break out
I always think right out when I eat
really bad and having eating pretty bad
lately yes not missing about that or
when my period is coming and it is that
time of the week one week mostly if you
got your period weekly you want to do a
quick disclaimer I know my skin is
fairly clear this isn't really acne it
just blemishes but I just wanted to
share this with you guys so you can
pretty much wear this anywhere if you
want to wear at school or the gym or the
beach or anything I really hope you guys
enjoy and let's just jump straight in so
when I do under makeup maker or when I
threw any makeup look I always cleanse
my face it is so important to cleanse
your face or at least just wash your
face before you apply makeup even with
water because it just allows for a
better application of the makeup it
makes your makeup look a lot more
smoother and sit on the skin a lot
better and also I find your skin looks
more clear when you are applying makeup
to freshly washed skin then just like
skin that's got a bit of build up some
like overnight or something like that by
the way if my nails are disgusting right
now I got November so I picked all these
also and getting them done tomorrow
because I am going to be wearing some
sort of makeup on my face I do select to
prime just because obviously I want to
make sure to stay on all day so I'm just
going to be using the Too Faced I know
the primer this is one of my favorite
primers because it is so moisturizing on
the skin and I just success with it
these leaves are like the wrong sleeves
to wear for this video so I'm just going
to be priming my whole face I'm just
using a group technique to clean brush I
love applying my primer
and like moisturizers and all that sort
of stuff with a stippling brush after
pana as you like to prep the skin a
little bit more just because I am not
wearing makeup so I went at speed
looking is best next I move on to the
Mac strobe cream in the shade of peach
light I like to apply this all over my
face just because it gives a really
natural flowy look to the skin and it
just makes it look so fresh and so Julie
and I just obsessed with how this looks
on the skin especially when I'm wearing
like minimal make-up you don't know what
strobe cream you can totally use a
highlighting moisturizer this one is by
taut and it is the brighter days I kind
of been hold it so highlighting
moisturized so this one does wonders as
well but there's one time that's like a
really pretty like peach tangent to the
face let me brush good okay I literally
lost my brush so I'll right now and I
smell it smells incredible I'm actually
going to get my eyelashes done today I'm
getting eyelash extensions and I never
had them before so I thought this would
be the perfect makeup look to do because
you're not actually allowed to wear or
not makeup but no I'm a top there so I
was like I might as well just wear like
barely any makeup so I usually doing
some videos when my skin looks as bad
because it's obviously when you have
blemishes you feel like crap you're by
yourself now as you can see that strobe
cream has given my screen just like a
really nice glow to it it kind of just
looks like really luminous and fresh and
glowy I just love it it just makes skin
look so healthy I like to just take the
benefit Porefessional primer just
because I do have a few pores on my face
not really many just around my nose and
under my eyes and plus I find this
product blurs your skin like it just
makes the skin look incredible like this
is a product that even if I'm going out
and I don't want to wear any makeup at
all I will literally just put this on
just so I just like to apply this on my
nose just because I do have a few armed
claws on my nose so this is just going
to blur out any of those and make it
look like they're not there I also do
like to take this under the eye area
once again just because it blurs out any
pores out a bit and lastly I like to
just tuck this over any blemishes I have
once again just because I feel like it
blends them and just make them look like
they're not there well make them look
like they're not there and insert that
twice why do I just say that fine
I like to start off by spot concealing
any blemishes or my under-eye circles
and that is pretty much all I do on the
face for light concealing or foundation
I don't like to use any of that I just
spot conceal so this baby has been my
lifesaver it is the pro and concealer
palette by a Napoleon powder so as you
can see this has three different shades
in it has a yellow shade of peachy shade
and more of a tan shade so just taking a
flat top concealer brush I'm going to
start by taking the tan shade so I've
just applied the tire a little bit on
top of the blemishes with the flat
concealer brush and then I'm just going
to use my finger to tap that into the
skin and even the tiniest little bit of
product just because this is a no makeup
makeup look you still want your
blemishes to fit through a little bit
because you obviously want it to look
like you're not wearing makeup by the
way this is not from the best modifier
I'm just freakin obsessive Spotify at
the moment for some reason but I just
made all these little play like night
out what else I have Road Trip chilled
feels I have obviously lists so if you
want some music because a lot of you
guys always ask me what music I listen
to
if you want some music or a playlist for
a certain occasion we might sort of
finally flirt you can totally follow me
on there now that's done I'm just going
to take this shape here which is more of
like a peachy tone and Pete returns to
do tone wrapped with like dark tones so
I'm going to take this I'm going to
lightly apply this under my eyes just
because as you guys can see I have
horrific bags so I'm going to take the
tiniest little bit of this and just
apply this one of my eyes I'm not going
to take it like out or anything I'm just
going to apply it on the inner part here
and just down a little bit here it is
the most darkness and then just blend
that out with my finger it is so
important to do until the inner corner
just because that's where the darkness
starts and that is usually where it is
the most dark
so you can automatically see how much
that has brands on my eye and just made
me look a little bit more awake so that
is all I do for concealing as you can
see you can still see a little bit of my
blemishes but they just are a little bit
more covered up and obviously you want
your blemishes to show just a little bit
because this is the Nomex I make it look
see what you think of so you want it to
look like you're wearing no makeup at
all before I go ahead and set that I'm
just going to go in with these hot
twinkles deep in the shade of spotlight
now this is a cream highlighter it is
honestly so beautiful if it's obviously
on the skin it doesn't look like you're
propped on the skin and it just gives
such an amazing glow to the face I feel
like when you have a glow to your skin
you just look so fresh and healthy so I
like to take my Beauty Blender is going
to start producing this on me high
points on my face just taking a little
bit on the tip of my nose and also down
the bridge of my nose as you can see
that has just given the skin a really
nice healthy glow how many times I want
to say healthy and how many times I want
to play glory in this video now I'm just
going to take a tiny bit of the benefit
of any pins lip and cheek stain now this
is a pretty intense product so I like to
apply this on the back of my head and
then just lightly tap a little bit on my
cheek now I'm just going in with the cap
on the translucent setting powder you
can use any translucent setting powder
for this but I'm just going to apply
this under my eyes when I applied the
concealer just so it doesn't crease and
doesn't budge
sorry I'm going to take the precisely of
my brow pencil by benefit and I'm just
going to apply tiny little strokes
throughout my brows just to make them
look a little bit more fuller I don't
like to go in and fully heavily fill
them in just because they will be a
little bit harsh against my makeup skins
now to make them look a little bit more
natural and taking the 3d Braille tones
by benefit in your shades fruit now
moving on to the eyes I don't like to
apply any mascara just because I hate
mascara honestly I hate the feel of
mascara on my lashes and I am about to
get my eyelash extensions done so that's
going to be amazing I cannot wait to see
what they look like usually I would just
run a clear brow gel or clear mascara
through my lashes this is the Ready Set
brow by benefit or just any clear brow
gel honestly so I'm just going to apply
this a little bit on my lashes just so
it kind of looks like there's something
there
and now for the very last step which is
the lips I will usually just apply any
sort of lip gloss any clear lip gloss I
might sometimes apply a nude lip or like
a light pink lip the packaging is
amazing but this is very nice on the lip
and it also has a peppermint smell to it
as well and now for the very last step
actually I forgot I take them back sweet
puffs and I just like to spritz my face
just to soak up any unnecessary products
or powder that's sitting on the skin and
once that is done that is the completed
and the makeup me but also everything if
