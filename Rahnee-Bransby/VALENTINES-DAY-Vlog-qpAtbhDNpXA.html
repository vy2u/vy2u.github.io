Valentine's Day
today's Valentine's Day but of course I
have to whip out my blogging camera and
film of love for you guys so we're going
to start our morning off by making
breakfast you guys really enjoy eating
me making breakfast last time so I'm
going to make it again a few guys I
don't know why everyone enjoyed that so
much but it was fun we're going to do it
again
by the way Brayden and I literally just
woke up
hence this looking crazy not cute
the Valentine's Day my darling a few
v-day going to make breakfast now we're
going to pretty much take what we made
last time
guys look at the beautiful roses Braden
got me they are funding oh my god
I just ran out the stairs so I'm really
a grass but now that breakfast is over
we're just going to chill to the rest of
the day I have a few videos to do and a
few errands to run and emails field
stuff like that so I'm just going to be
doing a little bit of work stuff and
then later tonight we have a few plans
where I probably look again then but
while I'm here I can quickly say a
massive thank you for the love on my
recent blog it honestly means to ask me
and it makes me so happy that you guys
love watching I'm really out of breath
and just all the feedback and love I'm
getting back on them literally means the
absolute world so thank you so much I
really hope you do enjoy them and I
don't think I'm going to stop doing them
anytime soon because they do so well and
they get so much love and feedback on
them see how this by the way I hope you
guys had a beautiful Valentine's Day if
that was with your loved ones your
family or by yourself items it was
enjoyable now I'm going to go chill and
do some work and I'll see you guys soon
so now we're on our way to include a
princess school they have an internal
ones New York and I honestly thought it
was like little markets and like through
schools up but I think and what breed of
things is it's like a little art what is
it like
if I can optic us a little so the
happiest of shows on you look like by
two just to show you what I see
so we're going to do that tonight
because every restaurant we can switch
high school up and book a table would
look out like every single restaurant so
we're going to go do dinner tomorrow
night
but Braden has to take us to one of
those rates tonight and I really heard
it what so it is so he surprising me I
haven't feeling a thing to do with the
second plate because they have second
showing that and here is how much I lost
the second yes so fantastic Lauren song
and it cannot like to have a sense of
like when we would like young kids I
remember they played a dress on TV every
single night and I'm going to put a
little bit of the song I would like a
montage of acid into the song is just so
funny maybe know if you guys have a song
from the city or from Flemington so like
if your city has going wrong because I
have a feeling tab is the only city that
has behind some rolling over really I've
never had a city to have it though
first it's not see and buddy yeah under
I was born and very easy I got is a
anybody ha wait on honesty so I'm a
little confused because we are nowhere
near friend Road where are we going I
hope it's my way like dressy because I'm
honestly dressed like I'm going to the
beach are we going to play tennis
no I don't have a life in another London
by Georgia thank you
well my leg is that way so so we are all
that really very healthy if the green is
before is benefit am I going here so we
just got here and turns out we're
actually at moonlight cinema so that's
the second outdoor cinema we've actually
been here before with benefit and it was
so much fun so I'm actually very excited
thanks for the surprise huh me sitting
here lap pool we're going through a
circuit we're going to remove it but I
still don't know what maybe we're seeing
can you just give me
flowers Leslie good we know I might rank
up give me a clue in the flower land
I know everything
warum I do not my fault so it is the day
after Valentine's Day and Braden is
working today I've just spent my day
editing of videos but as I said
yesterday all the restaurants that we
wanted to go through were booked out
because obviously it was Valentine's Day
and Valentine's Day is like the busiest
day of the year for restaurants and
stuff like that so we're going to go out
for dinner tonight we're going to our
favorite restaurant Coco's in Perth we
always go to Coco's it is literally one
of our favorite restaurants so I just
freshly straightened my hair as you saw
her yesterday that is my natural hair
and it is so crazy like it is so frizzy
but now I'm about to go do my makeup and
get ready fly out in a day by the way
look how bad my under eye bags are like
it honestly looks like eye brown eye
shadow on I have the worst under eye
bags in history I think I'm going to
film doing my makeup a little bit just
coming through like a tiny little get
ready with me being but I'm planning on
filming a a day night get ready with me
very very soon because I've wanted to do
one of those for a long time so let's go
get ready I this is a brand services to
drink if you were wondering it's not my
room hi I'm just at Freedom House as a
minor

don't know if I listen to like I'm about
to go out because I had to drill a
little stick Oh sir we're nesting poison
retro so we're at Hogan and rowdy made
out to go into the restaurant and you
slash down hunt down yes so we're at

really annoyed about because I want to
see that may be so bad but did you enjoy
