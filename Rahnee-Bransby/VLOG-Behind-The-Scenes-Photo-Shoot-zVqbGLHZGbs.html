my channel so right now I'm in a little
bit of a rush because I'm late once
again I literally and played every
second of my life so I'm in a little bit
of a rush right now because I am late to
a photo shoot whenever I try to be on
time or early it never works because
I've literally laid to eat every single
day I travel hottest but I always say
I'm looking a little bit weird because
of other photo shoot they just told me
to do my brows I'm amazed so that when I
get there everything is kind of ready to
go I didn't even tell you that is what
the shoot was for I'm doing a photo
shoot for my hair salon and circles of
Subiaco because they're opening up and
you sell under so that it was super
exciting I've done a plug like this
before on my channel for additional
circles as well I thought today would be
the perfect opportunity to look again
because why not I'm pretty damn tired
right now because yesterday I had a
festival and I did again today but
really late priorities today should be
really fun and I've seen most of the
hairstyles on for today and they are
freaking amazing you guys are literally
going to die so hopefully I'm over love
because I'm gonna be hoping around some
people but
hi babe my car delay that my god I have
the best luck in the world
so that is the shoot done and dusted I
really hope you guys enjoy this video I
am going to go edit it now and I don't
know how much footage I got so it might
be really really short can we just talk
about this hairstyle like I would never
understand how just can do something
like this because literally she can do
everything it's so the photos from the
shoot should be released now so I'll
leave them linked below along with all
the information from circles of Subiaco
if you are from Perth or you're coming
to that and you're interested in getting
our hair done I highly recommend circles
because they are literally the best I
always have and always will say they are
one of the best hair salons I've ever
been to and obviously I would never stop
going to them because they are just
crazy but I really hope you guys enjoyed
it if you did it please don't forget to
give it a massive thumbs up and
subscribe if you're new thank you so
much for watching and I'll speak to your
look very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
