welcome back to my channel so today I'm
doing a book for you guys but my best
friend Shanae is run away over and I
started to get caught so I just decided
to put on a jumper anyway I'm halfway
through my makeup I still go to put my
fake lashes on and everything but I
think I might have to start it all over
again because I've just we can put this
jumper on and I faced up courts my
jumpers because it's a turtleneck and oh
my god I've literally taken off my whole
makeup don't know if you can see it on
my nose but I have like all these tiny
little lines from like this John part
anyway I will fix that later but hello
everybody it is 7 o'clock right now me
and my best friend SHINee are going to
go on a little road trip say because we
found this really cool like like just
outside of persitz like an hour and a
half outside of Perth so we thought
we've grown a little road trip and go
for a picnic and taking photos and stuff
like that because honestly we have
nothing else to do today we are not
going to ask to and then tonight I went
to a little event I'm modeling for mac
cosmetics because I have like this
masterclass on which was super cool so
yeah so I'm about to finish off my
makeup and just waited personai but
before we do that I just want to quickly
do a little haul to you guys because a
few weeks ago I received some quoting
pieces from one of my new favorite
online stores ever it's called a arch
fashion if you guys have never heard of
it you have to check them out I am
including this in this haul it is a
little bit weird but because Splenda is
coming up and I am going to be rocking a
few pieces from arch fashion so I
thought that I would just let you guys
know about them and what they do because
other foods their stuff is incredible so
the first thing I picked up is a started
detailing belt I freaking love this this
looks so good with bacon approach jeans
or skirt and I feel like it makes an
outfit look really really edgy and like
super by car I absolutely love it
that I sorry nor my voice when I wake up
in the morning is so low and just like
husky and grove this is the next thing I
picked up is just a super long white
jumpsuit I wear this all the time it is
so so comfy and so nice on I have a few
photos in these pencils already so I
will insert them and show you guys what
they look like on but this is by the
brand one teaspoon and it is honestly
like my groceries throw on at the door
out there because it is so comfy and it
houses we
keep pockets as well by the way arch
fashion stopped over 2,500 labels so
that is crazy they literally have all my
favorite labels so it's like my go
through shop at the moment the next
thing I have is a little bit wrinkled so
don't mind that but this is another one
of my favorite shirts at the moment I've
been wearing it like crazy and I'm
actually going to wear this today
because I just love it so it's like this
really thin like cotton material I love
how this kind of gives like a boyfriend
by like it's a boyfriend shirt it
buttons up and it's kind of see-through
as well and this is also by the brand
1/2 screen but this is just like the
perfect throwin especially over bayes's
i love throwing this over like bikinis
now the next help I picked up I'm so
freaking obsessed with because I don't
own anything like this so this is a
denim and white polka-dot
host next-hop I saw this and my eyes
literally just like blew up I was like
holy crap I need that in my life
I don't know where I'll wear this but I
love it I think it is so cool and so
different I don't have anything like it
and lastly my favorite thing that I
think that problem actually I love them
all the slides I don't have a favorite
thing but like this is just so beautiful
this is a crochet bodysuit and I love
the coloring of it it is so like boho
and summery it's got this super cute
like really detailing around it and it
also has a really low back as well
whenever I wear this I get so many
compliments on it and it's just I love
it it's so so nice so yeah that is just
5 little things that I picked up from
art fashion if you guys want me to do a
biga clothing try on haul let me know
because I'll totally get a lot more
stuff and then I can do like a big
Fortran clothing haul but but yeah I
thought I was just friends in this year
because you guys love my clothing calls
and why not grow a mini clothing haul in
a vlog so yeah I will leave a link down
below to everything that I picked up if
you're interested I'm going to go fix
this makeup because I can't believe that
just happened
and pretty shot getting ready because
we're supposed to be leaving at 8:30 and
that's in an hour and a half so
you should get my degree of Lisa and I
mean is this for me to like hi I'm going
to scrub a chai latte please just do a
spiritual sources and then just a tall
skinny decaf cappuccino whose one
sweetener awesome thank you so much okay
have a good let's get the show on the
road
garrison it very so I try to clean my
steering wheel before we started filming
and I didn't realize there was dirt or
like fingerprints or whatever that is
still on it so just ignore that I'm kind
of like vomiting at it but I will be
sure to you have a clean for the next
time as well in the car key we're going
to LA for the Black Diamond which is
just outside itself it's actually an
hour and a half outside of clubs and you
guys may be thinking why the are
you driving an hour and a half late but
it's just because we had like nothing to
say we thought why don't and in Little
Italy so beautiful
but you can swim in it I don't think
it's not like like chemical disease or
something you know
and I'm going to services like housing
being and checked out like everybody has
like raving about at one point every
member being closely we saw it and
please we were I would like to excited

taking a little break because we have to
fill out and I have honestly no idea
where we are right now I think we're in
of sterling but I honestly didn't know
that was this class so yeah we just
doesn't set for tantalum in the world
are we so I walked in together key
political I don't think high taxes or
the gift but to make sure it was good it
is like that he was like
so we have just arrived at our
destination and holy guys I'm so
excited to show you because it is
actually incredible like it feels like I
was saying to Shanae on the way here
feels like we're in America for some
reason like I feel like this is what
America would be like but let's go have
a little explore ah I'm excited you kind
of want to hype it this beautiful
because we drive like three hours to get
here but it's honestly amazing okay so
funny so there's like um I think
suspicion I've got some fans you guys
going okay like we tried to pull away
from you clearly alright we accidentally
make a pirate stop please go away
alright okay alright go go I don't want
to like have them

so we just stopped at a place called
Miami Bakehouse which is like a place
that despise themselves we are going to
get a pie for lunch and then we're going
to hit the road because I'm running late
once again whoops we've got our pies and
it was a pie house but they had like
barely any buyers hella good so I just
had literally the craziest like three
hours over I just rushed home from down
south got changed and put my makeup off
