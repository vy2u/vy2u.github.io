my channel and welcome to one of my
first slides a in the last vlog I know I
found blogs on my channel but I've never
done a little day in the life blog why
am i speaking so fast right now I'm like
nervous with some reason I just wanted
to learn I was like stressed I'm very
stressed so I got a new vlogging camera
I got these phony a5 100 and if you are
looking at investing in a new camera you
have to get the 30 a 5 100 because it is
tiny but it is sort of freaking good
especially for floridays and I thought
also that time to go get a vlogging
camera and start vlogging for you guys
because you guys always ask to see vlogs
on my channel and another quick vlog and
I love filming blogs so I thought why
not go get one so today is Saturday and
right in the house today of work so
we're going to go out for breakfast do a
little bit of up shopping we might also
go to the beach because it is crazy hot
today
so I thought today would be the perfect
day to take you guys along I don't know
how this local road because as I said it
is my first day in the life blog but
we'll soon find out so yeah let's see
where the day takes us and by the way
sorry for where I'm filming right now
I'm filming in my kitchen but it is the
best lighting in the house
so now I just after the weeks because it
is crazy hot today and I just realized
I've got a subtle team if you find it
that's something I'm gonna have to get
used to because I know people like that
so let's go I'm so excited if you live
in Australia and you ever planning on
babies in Australia I highly suggest
don't buy a black car or a black car
with leather interior because it is the
worst decision you can have it inside of
Radiance cars leather and I dread
getting it up to this way your body just
sorry I'm editing the vlog now and I
just realize I didn't even finish the
blog I've totally got to get used to
solve logging thing because I'm so new
to it so I'm going to end it here I'm so
sorry this vlog was right all over the
place and not much happens and just like
trying to test the waters and get you
through it all but I really hope it
wasn't too boring and I really hope you
guys enjoyed it before I go I quickly
have a question for you guys I kind of
want to step away from the beauty videos
now I love doing Beauty but Beauty isn't
really my scene I did Beauty when I
started YouTube because I love makeup
and beauty then so I get me wrong I
still love it but I'm all based around
fashion now as you can tell from my
Instagram and stuff so I would start
doing more fashion videos for you guys
and well loves and just more lifestyle
and travel videos and stuff like that
and I actually get a heck of a lot of
comments saying that you guys don't
really know what my personality so that
what my personality is like and what I'm
like in general because it's very hard
to express your personality
because it is very hard to express your
personality through a bake-off tutorial
so I think it's doing more blogs so you
guys will be understand what I'm like
and I'll be able to express myself more
and get like more of a personal touch
with you guys make them see anyway my
question and I would love if you guys
could comment blue what sort of videos
you'd like to see instead of makeup
tutorials because don't get me wrong I'm
still going to do makeup tutorials just
not as much about as a room tour or
morning and night routine guys I will be
doing those but way in the future
because I just want to focus on it
getting my room so exactly how I want it
I'm such a perfectionist so I went over
to like morning on that routine after my
room is like exactly how I want so my
timer just died but quickly before I end
the vlog and say bye while I was editing
I realized this one was being so rude
and didn't even say hi so say hi don't
worry
anyway I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video please don't forget to give
it a massive thumbs up and subscribe if
you're new anyway thank you so much for
watching I'll see you all very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
