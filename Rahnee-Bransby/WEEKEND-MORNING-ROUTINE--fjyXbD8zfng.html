for me is around 8 a.m. I know that is
very early for some people but I'm such
a morning person and I love getting up
and ready to go straight away so I'm
starting off my morning with cuddles
with my girl she is my favorite thing in
the whole wide world and I also cuddle
Braden but he's helping me film so let's
just depend he's there just like every
single other human being on this planet
I check my phone in the morning and I
also start off my morning rinsing water
just because they get my body feeling
fresh and ready to go for the day so I
usually sit on my phone for about 10
minutes I checked my snapchat I check
Instagram Twitter just catch up on
everything that happened in the world
while I was asleep and then I have
another stroke I like to get up out of
bed straight away I hate laying around
in bed and I also like to finish the
glass of water before I get up as well
so smells like by the way how cute are
my pajamas I love Christmas so won't
wear them all year round and then I just
make my dad I hate from my bed isn't
made it makes me feel really
uncomfortable and I just love them
because it when it's made and then after
that I go straight over to my junk and I
check my laptop check my social media on
there I usually just catch up on some
YouTube videos also check my videos and
reply to some comments I love chatting
with you guys is one of my favorite
things ever I just took my laptop really
quickly and then I check my diary of
this thing cute you know my feet I
literally have to write and check in my
diary every single day otherwise I will
be lost today honestly by the way my
diary is from @qk if you were wondering
and I honestly felt really cool because
my nails matched my diary and I'm not
sure if you can tell about baby pink is
one of my favorite colors
now I'm off to the bathroom could it be
a business in the morning everyone helps
to do that and on Saturdays I didn't
usually work out so it's straight in the
shower for me I did a few little extra
steps in my shower routine this morning
just because I had a 21st tonight so I
wanted to be feeling my best so I could
feel a bank body repair me hydrating and
strengthening hair treatment and I
applied is in my hair I put this through
my root and the tube and if this is
going to help my hair from not feeling
dead and feeling it's best you can
this is a blend of coconut Moroccan
argan macadamia and jojoba oil it is
made to replenish and repair the hair
and it also helps with flyways split as
any characters hair growth I've been
using this quite a bit lately and I
absolutely love it it makes you have to
literally sorry silky smooth and
everyone wants out it smells just like
coconut and coconut is one of my
favorite scents so I will leave a link
down below to where you can purchase it
if you are interested and yeah I just
leave it all for 20 minutes and just let
it do its thing ladies please please
after 20 minutes has gone by it's time
to hop in the shower and wash it all out
and then I'm just going to shampoo my
hair just to get any extra oil out so
the shampoo I've been using is the Shu
urban moisture shampoo II sure is one of
my favorite brands for shampoo and
conditioner so I'm just really getting
in there and really cleaning my hair and
making sure that I've drove every part
of my head now I'm taking the Evo
fabulous area hair color of hair I like
to put this in my hair every two to
three weeks just because it maintains my
pink hair and make my pink hair pop I
absolutely love having pink hair but it
sure is surviving to maintain I usually
let that sit on my hair for about 5
minutes and while I do that I just watch
my body as I shave my armpit and I'm
just going ahead and cleansing my face
to be berthed basis and a facial
cleanser you guys notice with my
favorite facial cleanser I use it every
single day it is honestly the best then
I'm just rinsing out my hair and jumping
out of the shower start
pretty much what I do on a Sunday
morning my shower routine I don't wash
my hair everyone kept by the way I leave
I'm going out now I'm just going to
brush through my hair and it's a quick
blow-dry I never wear my hair natural or
freshly dry because it is horrible it is
so resilient so hard to maintain my
answers going to be straightening it and
getting it ready for tonight now I'm
just going to be straightening my hair
would be vanity planet flow
straightening brush now the thing I
found really cool about this draining
brush apart from any other that I've
used you can set the degrees to what
suits your hair types of bag so it
ranges from 117 to 370 ideally have gone
about 242 since my hair is so frizzy
sorry I don't have to have any acquired
high arms so it is 100% safe to use on
your hair and it is actually better for
your hair than a normal flat iron okay
I also found that it adds volume and
helps reduce frizz because have you seen
my hair it is that frizzy like I need
anything that will help in the juice
proof and it also adds a really nice
shine to your hair as you can probably
see while I'm going through anemia
even Braden mentioned while I was doing
this and he was filming he goes wow that
I she looks so good oh my I know right I
don't think it would actually found out
this good so if you want to check the
description below I actually have a
rocking discography guys which was a
b-52 sent off so that really makes the
$35 which is associated these and now
that my hair is Louisiana I'm just going
to spray some deodorant because I don't
want to be smelling throughout the day
and then of course I'm just brushing my
teeth I usually brush my teeth after
breakfast but I was in the bathroom
getting ready for the day so I thought I
would just rush in here and then I'm
just throwing in my line so cute
I know makes me attractive
and now I'm pretty much just ass
briefing dancers because by this point I
starving so it is time for breakfast on
a Sunday me Braden usually have not the
healthiest breakfast on weekends we
usually like to eat something a bit more
filling and people on the unhealthy side
because it's Saturday you can do what
you want to TV so for breakfast this
morning we are having a smashed a
variation on toast this is one of our
favorite practices ever sorry I'm just
cutting up a avvocato and smashing it
into a bowl and also adding just a
squirt of lemon juice into that avocado
mix and then I'm just going ahead and
dicing up some tomatoes and throwing
that your nursery cherry tomatoes are
like my favorite on breakfast I
literally am obsessed with cherry
tomatoes
I don't know when many people don't like
them because they are freaking good if
you like them let me know sign around
another one and then I just draw in some
Turkish bread into the toaster and
Braden is making a coffee
I don't like homemade coffee I know that
sounds into you but it just I don't like
the taste of it Plus with coffee I get
really bad anxiety so I try not to drink
too much and the Braden is designed to
cook bacon
and our favorite thing to have with
breakfast is IHG because it is honestly
the best triple bypass and it's a and
then I'm just heading back upstairs to
finish off getting ready myself for the
day so through my makeup and my hair
every time I do my makeup I have to play
music so I'm just putting on my Spotify
and listening through some Vanya's for
my makeup any single day I don't like
writing heavy makeup surrounded quickly
fading through my everyday makeup
routine but if you do want to be an
optimum retain it definitely let me know
now time to get changed out of my Humpty
outfit by the way this is from Kristen
Kelly if you wondering so I'm just
talking on a Zen a pair of shorts from
princess Polly as well as throwing on
this tee which I actually created myself
I'm sorry happy with it and I'm obsessed
so I'll leave a link down below to where
you can purchase it and tuck in the
front in and then I'm just throwing on
my favorite pair of like these are from
edginess and then as we use on my
favorite earrings that the room in Vegas
on the 99 and this will be hardest part
of it getting ready is choosing perfume
and the one I decided to wear today is
the achieve on chi on deja more I really
hope I'm pronouncing that right but I
love this scent it is so pretty and then
the second hardest part to getting ready
is choosing which sunnies I want so
today I decided to go with these clear
crystal ones from Oscar Whaley and then
that is my athlete for the day and I'm
at the golf
