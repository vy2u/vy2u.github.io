hey guys it's Ronnie and welcome back to
my channel so for this week's video I
filmed a weekly blog so I pretty much
just showed you guys how many week went
on and what I got up to I've never done
a weakling blow football so I thought
for this week's video that would be
super fun by the way watching pensive
look I realized Brayden wasn't in at
once of cervical anyone gets curious or
asks questions we just both had a pretty
busy week he was working and I had a lot
to do so he just didn't make an
appearance in this blog but I know you
guys love watching Brayden in my looks
so sorry it wasn't in this one but I
hope you guys enjoyed it and let me know
if you like the weekly vlogs because I
was removed so let's just jump into how
my week went on right now it is 7:30
a.m. on a Monday morning so I just like
hop and had breakfast and now I was out
to go to the gym I don't think I'll vlog
at the gym because today I'm going alone
and I feel really awkward blogging at
the gym alone I feel like it was so if
I'm there alone like with me on my blog
that was like okay you know anyway today
I'm just doing cardio and out nothing
too crazy because it's been a weekend so
I want to get back into it yeah sorry I
just missed out at the gym and I got my
smoothie this is like a manga and
panelists maybe and it's got basil in it
so the aftertaste is a bit funny but
it's still really really good and then
act that a protein ball I have a little
like juice place now I have and it's
literally the best I make the best
juices so I always get one after the gym
now and that to go do my makeup and I'm
also going to be doing a little snapchat

behind the scenes of that and I'm
supposed to go to an eyebrow tattooing
appointment today but that got changed
to tomorrow and so I'll see what else I
have planned to the rest of the day
after that boy are you boy or boy that
was such a hostile
I am absolutely heartless with filming
yesterday I told you guys go consume all
this selfie and I took behind the scenes
of like how do my snapchat holes and
stuff honestly without making any pieces

so yesterday I didn't vlog much at all
I literally just went through and
organized my whole room in my bathroom I
cleaned out all the cupboards and stuff
so I should have actually filmed that
like that would be an interesting to
watch but sorry I just wash my face and
put my Invisalign and in the flue it's a
bit like I'm blowing bubbles out of it
so right now I'm about to go to the gym
I'm not going to vlog at the end because
I'm going alone and I feel really
awkward at taking my camera and vlogging
when I'm alone when I go with my friends
I'm like perfectly fine so I'm going to
go to the gym now
so yesterday I finally got a new bedside
table I haven't had a bedside table
since I'd moved into this house but it
from a little shop in Perth called gone
bizarre I think it's only a birthday
starting to shop I don't think they have
it anywhere else in the world I used to
do modelling when I was little so it was
right next to where I did modelling and
every Saturday after modelling has
finished me and my mum would go looking
on with art and I was obsessed with it I
think that's how I got my life like
Dacor and like furniture and stuff is
because mum was obsessed with it so Al's
so Civet sorry a few weeks ago at me and
Braden went up shopping and also oh my
god calm bazaar we have to go there
because I haven't been there in like
years
Braden's like we're not going to go on
as art and I'll say oh yeah it's like
one of my favourite shops so we went in
and the stuff they have at the moment is
freaking incredible I almost wish I had
my own house because they have the most
amazing things at the moment so I saw
this stunning bedside table or coffee
table I don't know what it is I think
it's about side table but I go to our
bedside table and when I saw it I
literally for the next like two weeks
couldn't stop thinking about it so I
splattered screw
get that I got this stunning pot which
I'm obsessed with it was only like $10
as well and then I put these fake little
plants which are prone gums are as well
I'm doing like a little girl this is
from Urban Outfitters it actually is
made to like go it on the wall like that
and you hang your necklaces of the horns
but didn't realize how freaking little
it was when I ordered it oh wait no
wonder why it was so cheap I literally
thought it was going to be huge
it's my favorite to fuse it in the hole
it smells like my favorite perfume by
Marc Jacobs and then I've got these
little coasters which I stole from my
mom but they're actually so cool layout
on my old coffee table and I was like
thank you
and then down here I just got the
matching candle which I got for my
birthday and then I'm hiding these
little chocolates down here they're
actually really good they're like little
rice cakes and they've got milk
chocolate on top and they're pretty
healthy as well
