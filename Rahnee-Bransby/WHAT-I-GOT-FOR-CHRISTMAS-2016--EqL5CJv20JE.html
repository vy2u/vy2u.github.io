my channel sorry I just want to sum up
this video by saying a huge Merry
Christmas to all of you guys and your
families I know it's like three days
late but I really hope you guys had a
magical Christmas and got spoiled rotten
and ate so much food and just had a
really good quality time with your
friends and family I had such a
beautiful day with my family and I
definitely got spoiled and I'm very
thankful for it and with that being said
today I'm going to be filming at the
what I got for Christmas haul video I
have done this every year since I've
started YouTube and this year I actually
doesn't want to do it but I asked you
guys if you wanted to see it and you
guys are crazy and all of you said yes
so I thought why not so yeah I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video I would
love you guys to leave a comment below
on what your favorite present this year
was and let's go ahead and jump right in
so the last thing I got which I'm so
freakin obsessed with if you guys have
me on snapchat or you can Instagram it
you would know what it is because I've
literally spent every single social
media account me this it is just this
Mac may plant Jota here this is going to
be a little bit difficult to hold up to
show you guys because it is actually
huge but this is one of the most
beautiful things I've ever laid eyes on
I just do or when I look at it I think
it is so beautiful so you could just
have the little plant holder here and
then it goes all the way down I can't
even like I won't even hold it up high
enough to show you guys how long it is
but it is seriously ghosts or freaking
and beautiful this is definitely one of
my favorite presents that I've ever
received because it is sort of me like
I'll faint to Braden and my family and
stuff only I would get super excited or
got a plant for Christmas like I don't
think anyone would get a plan for
Christmas I'd be like oh my god yes and
when I opened it and hung it up in my
room I was like oh my god yes yes yes
yes and the other really cute thing
about this plan is the plant itself is
actually a magic bean plant so it has
like little green magic baits on the
bottom of it and it is so cute but if
any of you work here is to where this is
from it is from a little shop in Perth
called it little leaf code
maybe on instagram with the Dacor theme
I'm a sucker for take from what I loved
a close so much and I feel like that's
kind of a weird present to one because
when people are as a present they
receive presents by themselves but I
literally love like room decor and stuff
like that I just I'm a sucker for it i
scarce am obsessed with it so whenever I
received a cola I'm like oh I get all
excited so the next thing I got is this
read it two fuses set now I actually
bought this for my mom but in the
difference then I'll suppress by her
dissent but I actually got her there one
said and she went away for Christmas
there we are things about Ellie and I
celebrated and I was like there's just a
few saw and I'm obsessed with it so if
you don't know what to get me for
Christmas you can turn me get me this
and I'll be strikes with it I've already
got to add and in my room so this is
what it looks like here but the thing
that I love so much about this is this
smells like one of my favorite perfumes
of all time they're pumping that I'm
talking about is Michael Kors
it doesn't have an actual name I think
it's just the original Michael Kors and
it's like in a silver bottle with a
yellow liquid so when I discovered this
I fell in love with it and if I wasn't
gonna get it for Christmas I was going
to buy it for myself because it is
honestly it just sorry freaking good oh
this smell also reminds me of Sammy
because when I first met Sammy she was
wearing that perfume and she is the one
that got me as tester that I could
literally smell this for the rest of my
life and not get a minute it kind of
smells like fragile pennies and it just
smells really summery and fresh and
clean the next thing I got is a pair of
pajamas from Pete Alexander now I'm
sorry things look a little bit worn
because as soon as I got them I put them
and I'm literally obsessed with them so
this is what the top looks like and it's
just gray and it has a little dog on it
and the dogs um back side also goes
around the back of the show which is so
cute any buttons I just blew with it
little jokes all over them now I think
Braden got me these because I only ever
sleep in his shirt and Olivia shows get
ruined because I just sleep in them all
the time so I'm glad to actually are in
a public pair of pajamas now and I was I
find it really funny as though because
Braden is such a dolt OVA and I'm such a
cat lady like cats are my favorite
animals of all time I'm obsessed with
cats so much I've had cats my whole life
growing up so they are definitely my
favorite animal so when I open this I
found it a bit funny that Braden got me
the doll pajamas because I think he's
like trying to make me like dogs better
but that'll never happen because I'm
such a cat lady but I still love dogs
and they so sorry freakin cute and start
talking about the next Christmas gift I
got is this off-white pinafore
sorry it is just a super cute vintage at
looking at pinafore and the bottom my
other pinafore looks like this it just
has all these ripped up edges and
Heights also when it comes to pinafores
and short overalls I find it really hard
to find a pair that actually suits me or
fits me properly because half the time
they go up my crotch so this one is a
perfect fit and it also she ate somebody
really nice as well
and if Brandon got me this one as well
and he definitely knows my fashion
better than anyone so I absolutely love
this the next president I got is xenos
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
custard I have a main July this for the
longest time and I never got around to
doing it sorry when I reckon they sync
up this to the Christmas I was super
excited honestly I wish I go to earlier
because this concealer is incredible it
is definitely one of my favorite
concealers involved and now I can
totally see the difference between a
drugstore concealer and a high-end
concealer this has such amazing coverage
I feel like I'm talking about everything
like this isn't a whole whole but but
I'm so happy I got this for Christmas
because if I didn't get before Christmas
I would have never got around to buying
it and I would have definitely been
missing out another thing I love getting
is perfume I'm such a sucker for perfume
I have so many perfumes and I always buy
perfume and I have to start because I
have a really bad addiction whoa I just
broke way to faster sense so the next
person I got is a perfume and this is
the Elie Saab perfume this is my other
favorite perfume ever in the world along
with the Michael Kors one this smells so
freaking incredible this is such a
strong smelling perfume so if you don't
like strong smelling perfume so you
might not like this because I can
literally smell it just from the box so
this is what they sent came with it came
with a little perfume a body lotion and
also a body wash but honestly guys if
you want to know what I smell like
without signing creepy gross smile or
David Jones or to a packing store and
smell this perfume by Elie Saab and
that's what I smell like I guarantee
don't care of my nose I guarantee you
you will love this this is just I don't
even know how to explain I eventually
have a hair on my nose
any next time you my god I've actually
already found the packaging out for it
but this is a perfume angel by Thierry
Mugler I really hope I'm not butchering
that I actually originally asked for
I didn't by Thierry Mugler but that one
it was sold out and now it smells so
freakin good but instead it my dad got
me a jewel which I'm totally fine with
because it smells incredible as well and
this one also came with a little tiny
sample I think this one is so cute but
this n actually reminds me a lot of my
mom because my mom wears perfume all the
time is more mature and more musky but
it smells so good about tonight scent
and I think the packaging is so cute as
well the next two things I got a two
lush bathrooms so the first one is this
one here can we just take a my room for
this bathroom like this is the literally
me and about them this bathroom is
honestly it's re freakin stunning it is
pretty much just a go little I think
it's actually a Bobby Bob it kind of
some that eucalyptus and lemon I'm
pretty sure oh we live in just went
everywhere but I almost start want to
use this because it is sorry for he's
beautiful like this is just totally a
Ronnie thing do you know what I'm gonna
take a bath with this before festivals
so that I get out and I'm like
in God Blitzer and the other last
bathroom I got is this one here now I do
believe this is the frozen inspired one
but this is so beautiful it is just like
a baby blue with sky blue through it and
I cannot wait to have a bath with this
also smells so incredible oh my god
large bathrooms are honestly my favorite
like the way they come up with a set
like this I would have no idea but if
you guys do want to get a good lush
bottom my favorite one is called the
dragon Bowl I think it is dragon
something but that one smells incredible
like it is honestly to die for so that
is what the presents I have here right
now to show you guys but I also got some
alcohol a few gift that shows that I'm
totally gonna go buy perfume in and just
some money I'm very thankful for the
presents I receive this ti I totally got
spoiled and I'm so so happy honestly I
could have gotten nothing and still had
such an amazing Christmas I just want to
say again a huge it Merry Christmas and
if I don't see you before at the end of
2016 which I hopefully praying to God I
will but if I join I just want to wish
you guys a safe and happy new 2016 has
been freaking incredible for me honestly
thank you so much and such a suck and
when it comes to talking about this
stuff because I get all teary and my
commercial but you guys have made the
CEO so I'm here to listen for me and I
thank you from the bottom of my heart
