back to my channel so I'm here I'm still
alive I did not die
I'm so sorry I've been slow emia lately
I've been all over the place I've been
so busy I've been traveling to Sydney
I've been shooting I've been doing
everything I've uploaded one video in
the past three weeks
I'm so sorry that is so slack of me I
show Monsieur pre-filmed videos to get
them up for you guys but it's okay I'm
here we're doing it today Before we jump
on into today's video I just want to
quickly inform you guys on something
that has changed many of you following
me on snapchat or Twitter you would
definitely know that I just got back
from Sydney and I went to Sydney because
drum roll I picked up my Invisalign
I now have Invisalign which is so
exciting it's so crazy to say that from
here onwards my teeth are just going to
get straight on straight up in six month
time I'm going to have perfect teeth
like that is so crazy I never thought
this day would come where I say I'm
gonna have straight teeth like you guys
marry how insecure I am about them and
the fact that they are going to be
straight now is sorry beyond me yeah I
just wanted to say I did get Invisalign
so if my speech is a little bit off or
my words don't come out normal or I have
a little bit of a lisp that is why
because I really had it for three days
and I'm still trying to get used to
wearing it because this thing is a
bugger to talk with I am going to be
making a full-on dedicated video about
my teeth once they are complete and they
are done now that I push all that aside
I'm going to get on a tube purpose of
today's video I do tell a lot of you
guys that I was going to film and what I
got for Christmas video but my birthday
is so close to Christmas so I just
decided to film and what I got for my
18th birthday video because a lot of you
guys requested it and I thought I could
just throw in some of the gifts that I
got from Christmas in this video as well
I didn't want to do both of them I
thought I could just throw in some of
the gifts I got from Christmas into this
video as well I'm just going to do the
typical disclaimer that every youtuber
has to do at the start of these videos
because there are some
we had people on YouTube there are some
weird people out there but in memory
shape or form am i bragging I am so
thankful and blessed and lucky and
grateful for everything I got I am
seriously so lucky I could have got
nothing and I still would have had the
best birthday ever you guys requested it
so I'm filming it for you guys I would
not feel that if it wasn't such a
requested video but yeah and also thank
you so much for all the birthday wishes
on the 18th birthday yeah and all your
messages and comments and tweets and all
that sort of stuff meant the world to me
so thank you so much so let's talk me
through the video so I'm going to start
out with all the gifts that Braden got
me because a lot of you guys asked me
what Braden got me for my birthday so
the first thing I got from Braden will
see Mac prep and prime fix+
so I'm sorry thankful that Bruner got me
this because I feel like if you are a
massive makeup fan and you'd love to
make up your doll at the time this is
definitely a must in your makeup
collection it is seriously the most
refreshing spray ever if you wake up
with a hangover and you had this spray
like two squares with this on your face
and it will literally make you feel so
much better
I did that after my birthday and I felt
like my hangover just disappeared the
next thing I got that I'm super excited
for because I be wanting this for so
long is the Stila eyes are the winds or
your palate in the shade of mind or in
the shade
I wouldn't call would you call it shade
or would you just call it minds is the
reason why I'm one of this palettes so
bad was pretty much for this orange
shade here this shade is just gorgeous I
have it on my eyes today and I'm
absolutely obsessed with it but these
eyeshadows are seriously so buttery so
creamy so easy to blend and they're so
insanely pigmented like they have so
much pigment to them which is crazy I
also created a Valentine's makeup look
with the pinky shades over on this side
which will be coming eager at the end of
this week or next week so know
Valentine's Day is on Sunday the end of
this wait good the next thing I got from
Brayden is an hourglass hi Lana
and this is in the shade at luminous
light this highlighter is so gorgeous
I'm seriously obsessed with it it is a
very sheer highlighter so it's not
anything too over-the-top
too crazy which I actually really like
because it gives more of a natural look
it's kind of like a pinky champagne
shade and I have had my eyes on our
glass highlighters for so long now so
I'm so glad to others for the ones
who've been collection so that is
everything I got from Braden for my
birthday and the night before my
birthday he also taught me to a rooftop
cinema which is so much fun it was so
relaxing and so nice just to be with him
under the stars watching a movie
overlooking the city it was so amazing
we must remove drive with Ryan Gosling
in it and if you guys have not seen that
movie
I suggest you pause this video actually
finish watching the video guys go out
online and watch the movie Drive because
it is so insane like there's not much
talking in it but it seriously just
messed up my feelings laughter it is
such an intense movie not true little
Christmas gifts that I got from breda
that I really look sickly show you guys
in this video because they are to die
for
first thing I actually lost the
packaging pause so I just have to hold
them up is a Michael Kors of perfumes
there now this perfume actually doesn't
have a name it's just called Michael
Kors actually discovered it when I went
to Sydney to stay with sunny in October
because this is the perfume of some
layers and I seriously fell in love with
it so Brandon got it for me for
Christmas which I so happy for because
it is just like the best smelling thing
I've ever smelled in my life this is Lee
perfume I wear all the time during the
day this is definitely a daytime scent
it kind of smells like I don't even know
how to explain it is very fresh it kind
of smells like frangipani actually it
does smell a lot my French mummies it's
just very like fresh and floral and this
is definitely my daytime scent
and the next thing I got from Brandon
for Christmas was a pair of shoes now
the issues I saw all over Instagram they
were definitely the latest trend at the
room at the time or they still are
actually and I was a child mother
together because for the price
considering how popular they were I was
like do I get them going on are they
going to be out of fashion soon I don't
know so I just laid off it for a while
but I definitely one of them so bad and
looking off Brady got me them for
Christmas which I'm so happy about
because they are so pretty so they are
the added a super stars the ones with
new black
and the gold logo but these are so comfy
I've not won them a lot only because
they why and I'm scarce getting dirty
but I guess once I wear them in I would
definitely be running all the time
speaking of shoes and so many of you
guys have seen me work with a company
called hunter straw
they sell be best shoes ever so on my
birthday as a gift from them I got these
shoes now these are by the brand Molony
I'm not too sure how to pronounce our I
think it's Molony if I'm wrong and I'm
butchering that please let me know but
these are the j-man
leather heels in latte now I just need a
minute silence for these shoes because
they are stunning so this is what they
look like but this color is so unique
and I absolutely love it
sorry expect some Instagram posts very
soon so thank you so much answer so for
those I absolutely love them they are
amazing I'll leave all the links below
you have to recheck the mountains and
some love because their shoes are
seriously to die for and now moving on
to the gifts that my parents got me
Easter the first thing I got from them
we're flights to Sydney which I recently
got back from so they asked if I want to
fly its to Sydney as a birthday present
because the flights are so expensive so
I was like yes please that would be
amazing and that's what I thought I was
getting from time which I was very
grateful for but they also got me a few
other things there gonna be some money
which is now in my bank account and they
also got me some jewelry which I'm
obsessed with so the first one I got is
this necklace which is just like a black
silver and white dangling necklace it
comes down to about here I think it's so
pretty it's so simple yet so elegant and
my dad choices are which is so cute
obsessive it the next piece of jewelry
I've got which is sorry simple yet so
elegant I love just simple jewelry
because I know much of the jewelry
wearer
is this is silver bracelet now I have
really tiny wrists so it doesn't fit me
around my Bruce which is so annoying but
the other day actually was out to lunch
and I wore it up y'all and I actually
really like how it looks when it's worn
on that
like a really cool simple outfit it goes
really well now for the things that
Brady's parents got me
I'm sorry thankful for Brenda's parents
they are like my own parents they've
done so much for me they're so kind
fiercely loving they treat me like their
own and I have so much love for them is
this fluffy cutie now I saw Carly Jenna
hub I think it's a black and red one
with a little face on it like eggs very
and ever since then I was obsessed with
it and I was like once I get my license
I need to get one of those to spice up
my keys oh it's just like so soft and so
fun to play with all so obsessed with it
I just love it
next thing I got is definitely by far
one of my favorite things this one by
far is definitely my favorite along with
Michael Kors as well but this is more my
nighttime sin I usually register in the
nighttime it is the perfume poem by
Lancome next time you go to Davy Jones
or Maya or something please go into the
shops and smell this because I guarantee
you'll be obsessed with it and if any of
you want to know what I smell like this
is what I smell like okay oh it is
seriously so amazing I can't even eat
like I can't even eat special - smells
like it's very rich it's very very
strong when I spray it that night I can
still smell it the next day so it's a
very strong perfume so you only need one
spray but the next thing I got is true
sports bras what are they called sports
bras so the first one I got is just a
loss Brad neon green um crop um oh my
god so the first one I got is this
Everlast
a lime green neon sports bra I
definitely love going to the gym with
bright colors it just puts me in a happy
mood it's just like your typical um
sports bra it has a clip at the back
like that so it doesn't have a crossover
back it has actual straps and the next
one I got is the exact same just in
black after the last few presents I'm
going to share with you guys is from my
big group of friends I'm so thankful and
so lucky for other presents I got from
them if you're watching this I love you
girls so Margie seriously enough to give
me any
you know who are I got a lot of alcohol
from my friends which I'm like set four
days and to go along with the alcohol
actually got three of these I got three
of the 18 wine glasses so this is the
first one I got ideas so cute it's got
like 18 in diamonds and next one I gotta
have these butterflies all over it and
says 18 in pink glitter which is so cute
last one I got which I've seen it in
shot glasses before for guys but never
for girls is just this little black and
gold shot last in 18 so of course I know
II am obsessed with makeup so I go to
fiy makeup product I got three MAC
lipsticks so the first one is actually
from Braden's little sister Abby she's
the cutest little thing she's like my
little sister I never had
so this is in the shade naturally
transformed it is a matte one it's just
this gorgeous like nudie with a bit of a
brown undertone to it it's almost like a
caramel brown I'm sorry next one is a
matte matte lipstick in the shade story
now this lipstick looks so different on
everyone I think but it is just like a
gorgeous brownie grey more on the gray
side like a brownie gray lip color and
now the last matte lipstick I got is a
satin finish one and this is in the
shade of film noir your Noir
I don't if I'm pronouncing that right
but this is just an amazing dark brown
lipstick it has a bit of a read
understanding like a cranberry undertone
the last makeup product that I got for
my birthday is the MAC eyeshadow in the
shade a copper ring it's just like a
gorgeous red copper shade with gold
reflexes I think is so stunning now the
next present i gosh I'm so excited for
is a wallet now this is from the brand
status anxiety now my best version a
definitely knows me more than I know
myself and she got me this amazing
I'd print wallet and this fellow is
literally me in a wallet like this
screams my name Oliver is so soft as
well and it is just so beautiful I love
the pattern of it
they're coming very close to the end of
this video so the first few things I got
are these jelly bean bubblegum scented
car air fresheners now these smell so
good and they actually remind me of
scarlet so much because she had these in
her card the first time I met her and I
got in her car and I was like what is
that smell and now that this video has
been filled I'm so excited to put them
in my car
she got me these GD pants and they have
fun the bran cherry lady for any of you
were wondering and oh my god the pattern
of them is so cool the material these
are so soft and they just feel so comfy
I can't wait to put them on and boogie
in the mixer so amazing so yeah they are
so pretty and they're so flowy and I
just cannot wait to dance in these I'm
so excited so that is everything I got
for my 18th birthday I am so thankful so
