my channel wow it's seen a long while
since I've sat down and film to video I
think it's been about three or so months
so I'm really sorry that I haven't been
on YouTube for a while but I'm back
better than ever and I'm ready to do
this I feel like I'm being so weird and
awkward in this video because it has
been so long since I've sat down and
filmed the video
I feel like I forgotten how to film not
gonna lie I thought that I would sit
down today and finally feel my American
whole as you guys know I just got back
from America not long ago and actually a
while ago now probably like one or two
months ago one month ago two months is
being dramatic and you guys asked me to
film what I got in America so I thought
I would sit down and show you guys
everything that I picked up and bought
while I was in America it's actually not
that much to be honest I thought I got a
lot more about apparently not I just
want to talk about other brand that I
recently picked up a few products from
and they are actually an American brand
so this works really well with this
video right I picked up a few watches
from movement which is a really cool
brand that stops sunglasses and watches
and yeah I just wanted to quickly show
you guys them because they are beautiful
stunning incredible so I have a few
watches for a movement but I'm going to
show you my two at favorites a so the
first one is this one that I'm wearing
at the moment so the band of this watch
is just like great and their face is
white and gold as you guys know I'm a
sucker for jewelry and accessories or
I'm obsessed with these watches and they
actually work really well with my rings
which I really like this has been the
one I've been wearing the most lately
just because it's great and I'm obsessed
with the color granting women I love the
fact that the watch face is so small I
don't have any watches that have such a
small watch face and that's why I've
been wearing this one so much recently
because I have such little wrists
sometimes I find what does that have
really big traces I like literally
bigger than my first and I'm like where
my wrists are I love wearing watches
when I go to meetings or like classy
events because I just feel like it makes
you look really classy and put together
and they're so chic as well which I love
and this is my other favorite watch from
movement it is just blacked out with a
black band and a black face watch and it
also has gold detailing this one
actually captures really well in photos
which I found I think it's because the
black and the gold
we complement each other I really have
to cough but I find this one so sexy for
some reason I love how it's all black I
think it is
sorry shake and so beautiful I found oh
my this one on a night out for general
something it's not as like simple as the
gray one and this one's a little bit
more out there because it is fully black
I'm not gonna lie it movement watches
are the best watches I've ever seen I do
have a lot of other watches from other
brands and of course I can't talk about
a brand without you guys out with the
discount code sorry I will leave it on
the screen here it is Ronnie 15 so that
will save you fifteen dollars of your
order plus free shipping and free
returns I will leave all the links below
including the links throughout the
watches that I've got below it as well
if you want to check them out I
definitely recommend checking them out
if you're looking for a new watch
because they are just so nice and I'm
honestly upsets of them and yeah so now
let's just jump on into everything that
I picked up from America the first thing
that I want to show you guys which I
picked up I'm sure you've seen on my
Instagram because I literally raved
about this when I got it because it is
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen
I was on the mission to find this
specific thing while I was in America
and I think I found out on the second
last day before we left nicely I could
have tried to anywhere and I was like oh
my god no if my cool Lilly sky or Shani
are watching this video they're gonna be
like oh my god because I literally set
this one every single day while I was in
America it's just this off-white bag now
of white is one of my favorite brands I
love the stuff they have it's very like
industrial and just me it's very me
it's just cool you know I just really
enjoyed this bag and literally get so
many compliments on it whenever I wear
it and I think it just adds through any
look it literally just makes any look a
thousand times so I should got this from
Bonnie's in New York and I'm very
thankful that I found this bag because
the others would have not heard the end
of it literally every day I was just
like oh why of what oh my god
can we find it I'll fly back and he lost
his dinah thinking that I got from
America was a mask inner belt I'm pretty
sure it's pronounced in the scanner but
when I mentioned it in my vlog someone
was like you're butchering that and I
was like I'm pretty sure it's mosquito
but I picked up this red mosquito belt
with gold detailing
was going to get the black one but I was
also on the lookout for the black Gucci
belt with the snakes as the lorry go but
that is literally sawed out everywhere
sorry I decided to get the red one
because I feel like what is different I
haven't really seen a redness gain about
on anyone before and you guys are me
with my outfits I like to go all out so
yeah I really liked the red one now
let's get on into the clothing pieces
which I'm sure you guys are all waiting
for that I picked up in America um some
of the things are missing because I
think they're in the wash and you know
what I think I got more than this but
it's been that long since I've been back
who knows where it all is I'll start off
with a chop shop because oh my god I had
so many questions on one pair of pants
and I was waiting to process for year
before telling everyone where they're
from because it's just easier so on
Instagram I pissed the photo wearing
these pants and everyone okay I don't
know what's going on with them right now
but everyone went crazy over these so
these are actually from a Topshop
they're just black denim cropped Colette
I guess they're very similar to collapse
because they are only half way down the
leg and they are sort liked as well I
saw these and I fell in love with them I
thought that was so cool and so simple
but they're so comfy I did wear these a
lot in America and yeah the next place
that we went through is of an outfitters
I love bananas so much better in America
than it is online and I kind of went
crazy in there I literally feel like I
bought so much more in there than I have
here but I don't know where it's all
gone I have an outfit it's my favorite
store for bralette if you ever need
Braille it's definitely look on Urban
Outfitters they have it so many so the
fast one I picked up is this black and
red mesh Juan I really like it because
it's a little bit savory so it's a
little bit scandalous but I just love
the black and red I think it's so cool
I've never really seen a bra light like
this before and it gives me a very
sporty vibe and it's so comfortable
because it has no elastic in it it's
literally just mesh so I honestly wear
this all the time
the next violet that I have been living
in is this wide ribs knitted bralette
this is so comfy I wear this on the
jelly I actually want to grow on over
and after this and buy more because they
have these in like every color like pink
black nude white gray oh my god I'm
gonna get a girl on the next fall that I
got I literally wear everyday
I alternate between like the three of
these because they have so comfy and
that is just this Calvin Klein one and
it is Keira preen I really liked the
coloring of this I love wearing this
under a see-through top because the
camera pays three Plus this makes my
boobs look really good my non-existant
proves it like holds I mean really not
so it makes it look really good so I
absolutely love this and I feel like
every time I wear this I get a lot of
compliments on it so that's a plus and
the gloss bralette that I got from Urban
Outfitters I actually forgot I had to be
honest I put it in my drawer and forgot
it was that it still has the price tags
on and I haven't won it yet so it has
this gold like fishnet um detailing over
the top of the coffee bralette I loved
the color of this I thought it was so
cool but I haven't actually won it yet
so I definitely have to give it a go
it's actually so nice why I bought this
yeah so I got this white long-sleeved
fishnet crop top now I love wearing this
as you guys probably know under like I
always wear on to this um
and I love wearing it on to t-shirts
because it looks really cool with the
sleeves um coming out of the Taoiseach I
wanted to cut this shirt so I went I
wore Brella it poked out under the
bottom but I am so I cut it a bit too
short I'm not gonna lie but it didn't
turn out that bad got this in white and
I actually got it in black as well the
black comes just in the wash because I
wore it and I've actually gotten so much
wear out of these I wear them all the
time and I think that's so cool
egon we went through a little vintage
store in SoHo record at the vintage twin
they had such cool stuff in there I had
to hold myself back from going crazy but
this is the first one I actually cut
this myself it was an actual t-shirt but
yeah I decided to make it a crop because
I never wear t-shirts honestly I always
my crops so that's the first one and I
wear this one all the time I actually
get so much wear out of it and this one
is probably one of my favorite things
that I got from the trip and I'm yet to
cut this into a crop I want this so much
recently but I just tie it at the back
because I haven't cut it yet I'm
actually terrified to cut this because I
don't want to cut it wrong and then
never write again because it is one of
my favorite teas but yeah next we went
to a throw coldest or ellebra take if I
don't think that I picked up is this a
red pair of like five shots I guess they
just read and they have
a white and mashup stripe down the side
I wanted to get these for summertime
when you just want to be a really comfy
and wear like a baguette eat up tin
through these sorts of shorts basil slow
country and I literally live in them I
wear them all the time I know it's got
this top which looks so cool tucked into
those shorts
it is just a oversized white tee and it
says girls to us smack bang in the
middle of the shirt so girls to her it's
like sir Ella's thing they make a lot of
things that say goes who on it and the
last thing that I got from Cyril I saw
and I was like whoa I can not look past
that because it is definitely Ronnie in
a piece of clothing this is this cropped
bright orange denim jacket it has so
many rips all over it which is so cool
so it's just like really just dress and
cut up once again it does it goes to a
feedback but I'm really annoyed because
I haven't actually gotten much wear out
of it since I've had it because it's
summer in Australia at the moment and
it's getting so hot so I can't really
wear a jacket on a day-to-day basis but
this is such a statement piece because
it is like literally Florida orange it
is so bright and so cool I think it's so
different I've really seen a jacket like
this before so the last clothing store
that we went to it was pretty simple
pretty basic Victoria's Secret Victoria
Secret do really good on to wear which
um alike I don't know how to explain it
they just don't have a love stick in
them so it's literally just fabric and
they are my favorite type of on the way
to wear because it doesn't feel like
you're wearing underwear sorry I got a
bunch of those I obviously won't show
you guys on camera but I also picked up
a pair of pajamas from Victoria's Secret
because I don't have nice pajamas I
literally always sleeping like boyfriend
teens and stuff so I saw this pan I
really liked it because they are cocky
and cocky is one of my favorite colors
so they just silk cocky pajamas and they
have it Lacey telling around the button
I think these pajamas will be perfect
for summer because in Australia it gets
freaking 1:00 at night I'm honestly like
oh it's oh if you're not from Australia
it's a West thing you could ever imagine
and the last thing that I picked up from
Victoria's Secret I was a lab site oven
happiness it's just a black silk robe
I live in robes literally every single
time
I need to get ready Oh get out of the
shower I put a robe on just because
that's so easy to put on and off
especially if you're getting ready for a
night out or you have to do full glam or
your hair and yeah sorry I'm fairly sure
that is all the clothing pieces that I
picked up while I was in America now I'm
going to jump in and show you guys the
makeup I bought while I was in America I
didn't really pick up much makeup
because as you guys know II I'm more
fashion based and I love my clothing
there's not much eye makeup that caught
my eye but left damn it I'm going to
quickly start out with a perfume this is
by Versace and it's just I'm going to
put the name on the screen because I
jump in a butchered but this is honestly
one of the best smelling perfumes I have
ever smelled it smells incredible it all
literally if you go to the shop so you
have to give this a smell because it
smells amazing and it's one of those
perfumes that literally speaks to you
all day until you shower at night and
yeah I've had it for like a month and
it's almost all gone but this is like my
current favorite scent at the moment so
the first makeup item I got is this nos
palette now this is the vortex Lodge
I think palette by nas I probably
butchered that but this is a
highlighting and bronzing palette I'm
contouring it
oh my god I'm opening it from the wrong
end
that's why but first of all the
packaging is so sick it's inside it has
for highlighting shades and true
bronzers as you can tell at these tree
in the middle of my favorite base it
really nice on the skin they're really
soft and they kind of give a wet look so
they're a little chunky they really
finely milled I don't really use these
true on the end here just because they
are really really light and I have quite
dark skin and then there's just casino
and Laguna bronzer so yeah this palette
is literally perfect and I'm obsessed
with it I use it all the time
the next palette I got I decided to get
because everyone raised about it and I
loved it but I didn't actually have it
myself yet it's really really well but
this is the Anastacio modern Rene's
sunset palette you guys have seen this
salad every single person in the world
or in this palette I love the formula of
these shutters they apply it really nice
I love the color scheme as you can see
these three are my favorite and I
we use this palette every single day
it's amazing and these are like some of
the best eyeshadows I've ever used next
talent I got Michael actually has and
when I borrowed his before the trip I
fell in love with it so I have to get it
and this is another palette that I use
pretty much every day this is the taut
clay at play palette sorry I love the
packaging it's so cool like this has
three contour of bronzing shades and
tackle bottom and all our shadows I
freaking love the colors in this palette
they are so amazing so good for everyday
and I love doing bronze and brown and
mutual looks so these are perfect
shadows blend amazing the contour shades
are so nice and yeah I literally love
this palette so much it is one of my
favorites so if you are looking for a
good at neutral palette I definitely
recommend checking this one out and the
last palette I got is another
highlighting palette this is the Laura
gala baked gelato swell illuminating
palette I don't really write the
packaging it's very cheap considering
the palette is quite expensive but the
highlight is on the other hand are
amazing gilded honey is my favorite they
literally look amazing on the skin the
next I got products I picked up in see
it Clinique beyond perfecting it
foundation now this foundation is
seriously amazing
I love the coverage it gives that the
color is perfect it might be a little
bit too orange but that's so fun
the next thing I picked up is two of the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray as
you guys know everyone loves these they
are literally amazing and I actually got
these because it was true was $36 I
think and in Australia just one alone is
like $42 and that is ridiculous for a
bottle of water pretty much not really
kind of so yeah I decided to stock up
and pick it two-a-days up because I'm
running out of my other one and I
freaking love this stuff I literally use
it all the time
and the second last product that I
picked up is the Tod light camera lashes
mascara this is one of my favorite
mascara Emma and taht is really hot to
get your hands on from Australia so I
decided to get this and stock up because
I already have it two other ones this
mascara literally is amazing if you
haven't tried it I definitely
giving it a go and they last make a
product that I picked up is the laura
mercier translucent lose pad off this
stuff is incredible for baking and
setting onto the eyes and setting their
face in Australia this is literally
about $90 sorry I decided to pick it up
in America because it was a little bit
cheaper and I'm so happy I got this
because I am a Saturday it is so good so
that is everything that I picked up from
America I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I really hope you guys
enjoyed seeing everything that I got I
really hope you guys are having an
awesome day and I'll see you guys in my
next video thank you so so much for
