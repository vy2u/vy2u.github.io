channel today I have a what I got for
Christmas haul and I'm filming this
video today because seriously this video
got requested sorry sorry start
incredibly much within like a day of it
being Christmas and I literally didn't
know yet video could be requested so
much for me just a little side note I am
plastic at the moment so if I tell like
I'm dying or if I sound like a little
ten-year-old boy going through puberty
that is why because I have a really bad
cold at the moment and my nose is
blocked also just a little disclaimer in
no way shape or form and my branding or
showing off what I got to you guys I'm
so grateful and thankful for everything
I got like seriously I have got nothing
and yes they would still be amazing for
me but I am NOT bragging or anything I
just am filming this video because it
got requested so much and I'm gonna show
you guys what I got for Christmas and
also you leave in the comments below
three of your favorite presents you got
from Santa or from family or friends
because I would love to marry what you
guys got for Christmas as well so I'm
going to you stop talking and let's talk
money the video and I hope you guys all
enjoy
Sooey first presents I'm going to be
showing me are the presents that my
boyfriend got me because so many people
ask me what Brayden got me for Christmas
so I'm going to be showing you other
I hope for Braden's so braid and spoil
would be Rossum this year and I'm so
thankful because I'm actually so
obsessed with everything he got me and
we actually had a budget on how much we
were going to spend on each other and we
actually both went over that budget by a
little bit too much but that is okay so
the first thing Brenda got me is a glass
house candle and if any of you have been
in computer Alexander and you know as
soon as you walk into the doors it
smells like this amazing smell just hits
you this is the candle that they use
this is the Tehama I think that's how
you pronounce it it is a vanilla and
caramel candle so this is the candle
it's a huge candle I preserve burns for
like 10,000 hours it's so big
but the fragrance of it is amazing it
seriously smells oh so good I would like
to live off this stone it's like
everything in the world smell like this
I would be able to live off of it
forever
that's amazing I'm going to have so much
trouble pronouncing things throughout
this video so please bear with me
the next thing brain agape is the deal
j'adore perfume and this is what the
packaging looks like I actually have a
really tiny miniature trial version of
this perfume that came in like a travel
kit with four other side his mom
actually got for me so I'm so glad I got
this because my little version is
actually running out so I'm so glad I
got the bigger version because they
actually smells amazing and this is the
size difference of them this is a little
baby version and this is a big version
the next thing I got from Braden is
another perfume this is the chichi
perfume in the shade in the shade in the
scent vanilla orchard and I love
anything exciting vanilla so this most
amazing but we were actually smelling
them all together one day and I was a
sensor with the vanilla coconut one but
he was like this vanilla
so pretty sure that's why you brought me
this but they both smell so good and
this smells amazing so I think this you
have initially smell amazing because I
got like 16 perfumes next thing a Braden
got me is a pair of heavy on a thongs
and these are just the black ones with
these simple writing I wanted a pair of
that was for so long now because I think
they're really easy and simple just to
chunk on many are in a rush or when you
go to beach and stuff and I'm so mad
about things that actually wore them on
Christmas Day with my outfit but that's
okay because they comfy the next thing
of Braden got me is a pair of Mick pink
sunglasses this is what they look like
they're quite retro airy and like thick
and I'm obsessed with them they look
amazing on this is what they look like
on I'm in love with them I wore them on
Christmas Day and I'm just going to wear
them for the rest of my life because
they are so beautiful and I'm so
obsessed with them I'm literally gonna
say obsessed so many times with in this
video so you can count how many times I
say obsessed I will love you so this is
that the last thing that Braden got me
it's just this top from Cooke height and
the day we went shopping I was actually
gonna buy this for myself and he was
like no I like for you and it can be
your Christmas present so it's just a
high-neck sandy sandy beige color top
how about that and I'm in love with this
job Isis war on Christmas now moving on
to the stuff that Britain's a family
bought for me the first person I opened
up was a pack of the ganya skin natural
refreshing of makeup wipes and this was
actually a little joke present because
every time I'm at his house I always
forget to take my makeup wipes so I
always ask his mom if I can borrow some
so they got me something that I can make
that his house so that I won't have to
be asking for
all the time from now on the next thing
of Britain's family got me is the Marc
Jacobs before miniature perfume set so
this is just a little close-up of it it
has the Daisy by Marc Jacobs this is the
so fresh one the dart by Marc Jacobs
Lola by Marc Jacobs and the other Daisy
run by Marc Jacobs and that the
packaging is so beautiful I think that's
what I'm so obsessed about it so I love
this as well the next thing I got is a
full pair of Victoria Secret ones away
I'm not going to show them on camera
because it is a little bit more credit
the next thing they got me is this
really cute little lace crop top so it's
like a sign of flower yellow color and
it has these straps that you obviously
we're on at the top and then these are
all arm holes that go into your arms
obviously and I just think this is a
cute little thing is so summery because
of the color of it and it is so cute
and this one I'm so excited for and the
last thing I got from Brady's family
which is so exciting and I'm sorry
thankful and grateful for is a trip to
Bali with Brandon and his family in
April 2015 and literally they didn't
have to do that but they invited me and
I'm sorry sorry sorry credibly thankful
for that because that is probably the
best Christmas present I received this
year it is amazing and yes Brandon's
grandma and granddad also bought me any
of principal Christmas which I was not
expecting and they go me the Calvin
Klein womens miniature 5 perfume set and
it comes with the intern of the Aqualung
sheer beauty eternity
I don't even know how to pronounce that
word but I'll leave it listed blurry and
the CK one the next thing I got was from
brains steps dad's sister that is a
tongue tire and they are these cute
little love heart Sunny's don't you
think they're just adorable she actually
got all the kids in at brightens family

different funny ones and I know these
cute little rabbit love hearts uh gloves

these because I really simply wanted one
and I'm gonna show everyone I've got one
for Christmas it is a selfie stick now I
think my mom actually bought me this
before a jury I always asked her to take
something for me so when I got this she
was like you will no longer need me to
take a selfie for years and from my
auntie and uncle I bought two presents
so the first one is the Marco Valentino
perfume in a tree I think I said his
neighbor and hopefully and the next
thing I got is a little black glittery
purse from H&amp;amp;M and it's super cute I
think it will come in handy when I need
a little person carry around a price
line a gift card and this is a few
