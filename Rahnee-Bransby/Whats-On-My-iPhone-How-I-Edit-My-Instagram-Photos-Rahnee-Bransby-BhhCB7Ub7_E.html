channel thank you so much for watching
today I have a really really good
question video which is the what's on my
iPhone and how I ended my Instagram
photos video not every single time I
puts in the Instagram photo someone will
comment and say how did you edit this
what app to use what effects to use for
your photos and so on so I thought why
not film a video showing you guys hi in
my Instagram photos and also show you
guys what's on my iPhone so I hope you
guys will enjoy this video and let's
jump straight into it to the iPhone I
have is the iPhone 5s this is just the
gold one and it is much at the moment
please ignore that a month after I got
it I so gently bashes on some stones at
the front of my house so I was hoping my
friend like this and I thought those
hair on my screen so I tried to like
remove they have from my screen then I
moved to my finger and realize that it
gets smashed and that was the worst day
of my life moving though so I haven't
done around to getting it fixed so here
we have my phone so it is just the
iPhone 5s in the gold one
and yes the screen is smashed so let's
just you know that so here we have the
background photo I'm not too sure
whether um Friday was taken her to get
off tumblr and it's literally my
favorite forever so that's my background
photo now opening up this is my other
background photo it's just a photo of me
and my boyfriend's oh how cute so I like
to set up my phone in photos because I
only like having one screen I don't like
having more than one and I kind of just
like everything being like sorted out
properly so in the top left corner up
here I just have all the stuff that I
use all the time and then on the other
pages I just have the other stuff that
comes with the phone which no one ever
uses really so in this folder I have the
clock Safari and YouTube I'm always on
YouTube always checking my YouTube so
here I have Yahoo whether I prefer this
over the normal weather on the iPhone
because it shows really pretty
background
so it just has where you are located and
the weather and send the weather for the
rest of the week in Perth that's been
quite raining and stuff so I just want
to show you guys like the pretty pretty
backgrounds at hazards like a mess so
you can put that's all I have in there
but you can put like as many states or
cities as you want and then I have my
word a phone which is my net so I got in
with my phone just to check my usage and
the start and then I have notes and i
like to jot down a lot of video ideas
and locations and like all this sort of
funky jazz where I want to feel more
like what I want to film and yeah I have
a mail just to reply to all my business
emails when companies messaging and then
I have Google Maps and then the App
Store and then on this page I just have
all the stuff that comes with the rest
of the phone so that's not important and
then in this folder here I have all my
photography apps which I'll get into
detail very soon when I show you guys
how to enter my Instagram photos so the
ones that I going to be using later I
will just show you now so I have this
one down here which is called photo
vault which I put all my photos in that
I don't want in my normal photo album so
any like private photos or anything I
don't want anyone to see I put in there
and then I have this app here called
wallets I think that's a down so I'm not
sure this is a really cool app because
it allows you to get that white
background on your photo like that hat
on there so all you do is choose a photo
put the front of there and then choose
what color background you want so for
example if I want white I'll just put
the white on there and then yeah you can
just scale it to however you want it and
then save it and yeah you get the drill
and then the next one I have is in
society on here that's just to get the
white background on Instagram photos I
don't use that much anymore because I
don't use white background on my
Instagram photos anymore
and then I have this one called font oh
I think and that's how I make my
thumbnails on my videos so it just
allows you to put all these funky texts
and stuff on your photos so that's about
it the others I'll get more into detail
later when I tell you guys how you edit
my Instagram photos the next photo here
I have all my social media sites and
some little games and stuff so I have
tumblr I'm
tombola is like literally live and then
I have Oscar femme I don't use Oscar
femme that much I just used it to post
my videos on and answer some questions
then I have a snapchat I constantly use
snapchat a way to guys so I'm constantly
on snapchat it is like amazing if you
guys want to add me you can scan that
little snapchat wants a great thing
otherwise my snapchat username is just
Ronnie then next I have a Twitter I'm on
Twitter all the time now I'm obsessed
with it so if you guys want to check out
my Twitter my name is just Ronnie Brandi
I'm pretty sure yep my name is just
Ronnie Brasserie so feel free to follow
me on there if you like then I have
Shazam now this app saves my life it is
literally amazing whenever I hear a song
come on that I really like I just Shazam
it and it will pick up the song
obviously those not as something right
now so it won't pick it up that's are
kind of annoying but it just picks up
the song that you're listening to you
and tells you this song which is amazing
as you guys might be able to tell I just
changed something a little bit I had it
SoundCloud on that page and I realized I
don't use I tube at all so I just moved
sound card there because I use that all
the time so the next stop I have is
Spotify I don't use Spotify much I used
to use it all the time and then I
discovered it's SoundCloud which I use
all the time so I just really use this
app for my relaxation sleeping playlist
that I made I always have to listen to
music when I fall asleep so I just use
that app for my falling asleep music my
name is Ronnie on the store if you want
to check that out and then down in this
corner here I have SoundCloud I use
SoundCloud all the time literally it is
amazing so if you guys ever want to know
what like songs are played in my videos
or want to find out what music I listen
to just check out my soundcloud it's
just Ronnie breastfeed because I'm
constantly on the reposting music and
whatnot
I love that and then I have facebook
messenger just to reply to people's
messages on it Facebook I can't get over
how disgusting my friend looks like look
at that so gross anyway then I have this
game quick bounce
I'm not sure if any of you guys will
remember it
I don't know if you remember the old
Samsung's and they had that game I'll
show you they have that game with the
little red ball and you have to like
jump over things and this little game
let's just show you guys this game I'm
not sure if you remember it um that game
I recently discovered again and oh my
god I'm overly obsessed I've gone up
here I have Instagram obviously I used
Instagram all the time I think it's the
most used app on my phone my favorite
app as well so Instagram is Ryan Browns
to be underscore if you want to follow
me on there and so you know I'll show
you how to how I edit all these photos
and I just have photos which is your
regular face Facebook I burn up photos
album with all my photos in then
settings and camera and then Bankwest
which is the bank I'm with to do some
online banking and then down here as my
main bottom floor I just have phone
Facebook messages and music so tonight
it's me to watch everything that is on
my iPhone so now let's go ahead and jump
into how I edit my Instagram photos so
the first thing I do is obviously take
the photo and have the photo already so
I'm just going to use any random one I
think I like to do is use this up here
called Avery and I use this sorry let's
pick a photo I'm just going to use this
one this is me looking like Willy Wonka
because look at my mouth it's so funny
anyway so this is a photo I'm just going
to show you guys how I edit my photos
and stuff with so this app is just like
any regular app they have so many but
this is like one of my favorites I use
this app to change the lighting and the
brightness and stuff so if I want it
light or dark I usually make it a bit
darker depending on the photo and then I
change the contrast I put the contrast
up it's tiny bit and then I have
highlights here which I like to put the
highlights up in my photo or not I like
to put it up just a little bit that
there I like to turn the shutter down
just a tiny bit just to make it look a
bit more better quality and what not so
then I'm moving across we have like
blemish blur why not rah-rah-rah
I don't use any of those I like to go in
this one coat here here good color and I
just like to move the saturation up and
down so if I want it black or white or
if I want to be color to pop a little
bit more I usually put that up just a
tiny
tiny bit and I put warmth here you can
make the photo a lot more yellow tones
or a lot more blue tones so I usually
put it just a little bit about there
just to make my photos just to make it a
bit purple toned I don't know if you
guys notice about all my photos on
Instagram have a purple tone to them or
like a bluey tone so I like to put that
there just to give it more of a purple
effect to it and the same with Tim you
can make it a lot more green or a lot
more purple or pink and then I just put
that up a little bit more just to make
it a lot more purple and whatnot and
then we have it fade here which is
obviously fading the photo I'm not
feeding it I usually put that up just a
tiny little bit to give the photo a bit
of a fade and then that's pretty much
how I just get the base of the photo and
then I have this one here called
orientation where you can just pretty
much change the direction of the photo
and yeah so we're not going to change
that one today so then I just save the
photo and it goes in to my photo album
now moving on to the next one which a
lot of people ask me how I get the
effect on my photos I use vsco cam I'm
not sure if it's called disco camera or
vsk cam but that's the one I use here
everyone and their mother and their son
and their dog use this up it's amazing
so I just add the photo in that I want
to use at the end of the photo you just
double click on it to make it bigger and
click this little button here and this
gives all the effects all of them but my
set out down here is a bit different to
everyone else's when you actually buy it
when you actually download the app
because I actually bought it every
perfect I love this off so much that I
ended up buying every effect so it has
all the effects down here and I just put
mine in order to like how I like them
the most
once I don't use at all really and then
I deleted the ones that I just hate so
what am i doing so going back into the
photo um so this is the all the effects
the one I mostly use is f2 here which
gives that really purple effect that I'm
just gonna zoom you guys in a little bit
and I click on it again and it will come
up with this little thing down here this
allows you to put the effect on a lot or
put it on not much I usually put that on
about 7 or 6 depending on the photo
maybe even 5 so we're just going to have
it
by today and then I just saved the photo
into my camera roll the other one I like
to use is t2 which cubes it's really
cool like faded effect or there's all
the black and white effect in yeah so I
just like to play around with that and
get the photo how I want it and once I
have it I usually just go onto Instagram
and upload the photo yeah so now I'm
just going to show you guys some other
really cool apps that I love there's a
sign in the corner here called fragment
this is such a cool app so what you do
is add your photo in I like that so
pretty much it has all these awesome
effects down here which make up the
photos so groovy so I just like to
shuffle it really and it will give
really cool effects and yeah you can
move the photo in the background of it
or move the actual or move the actual
Freidman I like to put these on the side
I'm not sure if any of you guys notice
but sometimes I put um D frames like in
the side like that was something I just
love this app it's so it's so fun just
to play around with it and find some
cool like effects photos and stuff this
is such a fun app I literally spend so
long playing on this app and yeah some
of the photos sometimes aren't really
cool now another question a lot of
people ask me is how I do this put two
photos together or how I do this
highlight the photo reappeared on its
side pretty much how I do that is I use
this up here called split pic so what I
do is I usually choose this layout here
there's so many you can choose from by
alx choose this one and then you add
your photo in I add the same photo into
both sides so it looks like that and
then I take it down to the square one
because obviously my Instagram is
squares and firstly I'll show you how I
do the one where it repeats on the other
side so I just add the photo in and I
just move this thing here and I just
move it all the way to the end to about
there
so once I've moved that bit to the side
and then I just kind of put this photo
in this frame anyway we're moving that
around anyway why I want it really so
want to repeat the photos there or like
give another background or something his
body isn't it really a photo to do that
things that effect on it but yeah just
whatever I'm feeling for the other
effects where it kind of fades a little
bit in the photo I'm just going to use
another photo this one for example that
I uploaded yesterday so all you do is
you grab your two photos so I have my
two photos here and then I just position
them to where I want it really and then
I move you can also move the little
thing in the middle as well so depending
on whereabouts you want your photos and
then so once I have it positioned to how
I live that's about there once I have a
position to how I like that's pretty
much it if you don't want it to look
like this two photos and you want it to
look like there's only one I just moved
this little button here and it just
blurs the middle of the photo and gives
like a really cool little mix so just
looks like there is now
just one photo and I'm in both of those
photos so so I hope you guys all enjoyed
seeing what's on my iPhone and I hope I
hope some of you guys out with anything
it's your app owners and any of those
apps that I sure do come in handy if you
enjoyed please give this video a thumbs
up because it doesn't mean the world to
me it also made some comments below
because I love hearing from you guys and
hear your thoughts and everything so I
think that's all I have to say so until
next time I will see all you stunning
people very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
