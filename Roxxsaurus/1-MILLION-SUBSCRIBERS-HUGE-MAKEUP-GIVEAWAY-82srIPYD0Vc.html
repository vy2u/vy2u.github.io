it feels so surreal like a lot of you on
Twitter have been asking me like how are
you feeling how it's like to die you
once if you like to have 1 million
subscribers and honestly I didn't feel
that different it doesn't mean to say
that I'm ungrateful because I just hope
so so grateful like you guys don't know
how much this means to me but at the end
of the day I love you guys
unconditionally I love you all when
there was 50 of you I loved you all and
there was 1000 of you 100,000 of you and
I loved you at 1 million as well just as
equally and it doesn't matter to me if
you have joined recently or if you've
been there from the beginning
I just appreciate all of you so so much
I still miss that what YouTube channel I
didn't think that we would get this far
I always find it very funny how you guys
are like oh my gosh I didn't expect her
to reply and no matter how many of you
there are I'm always and try my best to
reply to as many people as I can and if
I can't reply I'll at least acknowledge
you because that's the best I can do
there's only one of me and I do all of
this by myself so I feel like for the
amount of people that do watch my videos
now I am still doing really good at
connecting with you guys and I just love
that about you Jill I'm having true
friends I never really had a great
amount of friends in real life I was
never
they're really popular kid got a group
of friends I was always having the
outsider that no one really liked so to
have like 1 million of online friends
it's just amazing and I want to meet you
guys so bad how much you're going to be
at summer in the city so I think I might
be out on the saturday or something I
don't how I really decided yet but I
will be out what day I'm on and I'll
just be walking around so if you guys
are around and please come say hi to me
I'll probably tweet where I am on the
day so basically to sum this up I just
want you guys to know how grateful I am
for all of you you guys have literally
quite literally changed my life I can't
thank you enough I'm forever indebted to
all of you because really all these
opportunities I get the fact that we
have hit 1 million subscribers on this
channel it's just
all thanks to you it's all you you right

possible but anyways I feel like I have
said my thank yous and now I should move
on to you at the giveaway because it is
a huge one none of the rules of the
giveaway it's pretty simple all you have
to do is be subscribe to this channel as
well as my blog channel which I'll link
down below as well as following me on my
social media which is Twitter Instagram
and snapchat everyone isms are pretty
easy if you don't have a Twitter or a
snapchat it's so so easy to make one
giveaway it's open internationally so
wherever you live you can enter it
doesn't matter if you're not from the UK
and for the actual entry to enter into
the giveaway you have to comment down
below what brands were most excited
about winning so I'm about to show you
all the products from the different
brands that I'm going to be giving away
that makes sense I hope that mixes and
that will automatically enter you into
the giveaway I've never done one of
these giveaways before so I want to say
you can comment as many times as you
want but I have a feeling that if you
comment like the same thing by just
copying and pasting your sentence
it might go into the spam folder which I
don't want
that to happen to you guys so if you do
plan on commenting more than once make
sure you change your sentence around a
little bit so that youtube doesn't think
that you're trying to spam my video if
that makes sense and for extra entries
which are compulsory you don't have to
do these but you can if you want to you
just retreat my picture and then comment
