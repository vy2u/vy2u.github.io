hope you guys are doing super well so
today I have a really exciting video I'm
going to be doing another get kind of
video and in today's video I'm going to
be talking about things that all could
people go through and if you yourself
aren't all good person you are totally
gonna relate to them I ask you a super
awkward person in real life so these
things are definitely things that I've
done plenty of times myself
today's video is also in collaboration
with my youtube friend Jesse page you
guys haven't heard of her before she has
a very similar channel to mine and her
videos are absolutely amazing so you
guys definitely should check her out
we also did a video for her channel and
it's all about like conspiracies and
it's just really really creepy I only
hope and I'm down in the description so
go click it and go subscribe and tell
that I sent you if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure you smell that heat
thumbs up just down below and also
subscribe if you want for a new because
I would love to have you come and join
the dinosaur family and also currently
doing daily vlogs so on these local
channel in the corner as well as the
description but without the radio and
let's get into the video
okay and the final awkward situation is
when you're greeting someone and you say
the wrong thing this has happened to me
so many times
oh hey I kept Ike oh you did nothing
else I'm good on our how are you okay
later then the next line is saying you
two to something that someone is an
action taking part in do we get enjoy
anything you two I'm not coming with you
I just work here
now all the most awkward thing that
anyone could ever do waving back to
someone that isn't waving back at you
you know when you meet each other for
the first time you have that awkward
like you don't know what if you give
them a handshake or just hug them and so
you kind of don't really do anything
yeah hi hi how are you nice me now this
I do all the time because I stalk a lot
of people in social media and when you
go all the way back to the very bottom
of the timeline and you accidentally
like the picture you're like why did I
do this okay time to have a look at map
Instagram oh you look so cute now photos
oh no I just like his photos no he knows
I stalk him ah the next one is an
absolute classic for someone that's an
organ person when you're out and about
and you see someone that you know you
simply just run away because you don't
actually want to communicate with them
Roxie's are you high okay like I didn't
recognize you then what you thinking
here oh you know just doing some
shopping what about you oh yeah yeah
same okay cool yeah
both the weather's nice yeah
yes very nice all right I'll see you
later then I don't know what it is about
me but I just simply cannot grasp the
concept of a pull or push tour I always
seem to get it wrong
you don't want to say inviting someone
and you're like hey hi hi and then you
end up walking the same way I admit
she's the most creepiest thing you could
ever have happen to you hi this will
happen to me plenty of times that when
you'll get lost you kind of don't want
to turn around as there everyone around
you stones and your loss you kind of
just keep walking in the same direction
thinking in your head oh my god I'm
going the wrong way but you still keep
going that way and then you pretend that
to answer the phone and your friend is
calling you on the firing page to meet
you something oh my god I'm going to go
oh my god what do I do okay okay
have you got this oh yeah where are you
yeah yeah I'll make it out I'll be five
minutes
Annalise what is taking photos with
someone who is so experienced in my
photo shoes and them I'm really
confident and you're just kind of stood
there in the background like okay I
don't know what I'm doing here
