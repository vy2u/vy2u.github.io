guys are doing it super well and having
an amazing day so far as you can tell in
today's video we're gonna be doing the
10 things that you have been doing wrong
all of your life and don't get me wrong
you are not alone I definitely have been
doing these things wrong all of my life
as well and by doing things wrong I
don't mean you have to live your life
this way
you can't live any other way this is
just a better and more efficient way of
doing certain daily tasks in your life
PS yes the pink hair is back I'm so
excited to have pink hair again I
honestly missed it so much and since my
pink hair is back as promised I'm gonna
do a giveaway of the other box hair dyes

different colors which I love so if one
of you would like to win all of these
gorgeous hair dyes all you have to do is

grow up follow me on instagram at Brock
Sora's and that is literally it's the
only other thing you would have to do is
comment down below it because you're
most excited to try out and also leave
your social media so I can contact you
if you are the winner all that other
information as to when the giveaway is
gonna be ending is gonna be in the
description so make sure you guys check
that out as well but I'm not rambling if
you guys want to see ten things that
you've been doing wrong all of your
lives that's let's get into the video so
the first thing that I've been doing
wrong all of my life is pouring the
popcorn straight out of the packaging
after popping it in the microwave what
you should be doing is using the tiny
opening in the popcorn bag to shake out
all of the unpopped kernels this way you
can dispose of all of them first before
serving up your popcorn and if you do
this you'll never be eating unpopped
kernels by accident again I have
definitely almost broken a tooth on
those once or twice you can then share
it with your friends safely without any
broken teeth and as you can see my cat
is very fond of popcorn
the next thing you've been doing wrong
is taking out tin foil out of the box
and trying to tear off a piece this
often goes wrong and tears off uneven so
what you should be doing is keeping the
tin foil in its original box because it
actually has these tabs on either side
that you can press in this will keep the
roll inside the box securely while you
try and tear off a piece I never thought
to look at a tin foil box twice and look
at any small details but this actually
works don't you hate it when you're
having a drink and it leaves a watermark
on your table when you have no coasters
it is so annoying and it can fade the
pigment of your word over time what you
probably didn't know is that modern
disposable cup lids are also designed to
serve as coasters so next time you've
got a disposable cups take off the lid
and place it underneath the cup and it
will prevent those really annoying
circles on your table sky really hates
them too I never knew this myself but on
the back of the packaging of q-tips it
actually says do not insert it into your
ears or nose and then it should only be
used for the outer ear so instead to
cleaner is inside you should use things
like wax softeners because a q-tip can
actually push the ear wax further into
your ear you know when you're casually
just pouring yourself a glass of juice
and this happens
to prevent this catastrophe from
happening all you have to do is pour
your juice with the opening upside down
this allows the trapped bubbles of air
to come out much more smoothly as you
took the carton of juice meaning it will
never spill all over your counter like
this again have you ever tried to untie
a knot and failed miserably don't worry
I definitely have especially with these
long nails instead of trying to loosen
the knot itself what you should do is
twist the ends of the knot until they
become almost solid and then you want to
kind of push them through the knot and
apply loads of pressure this will really
loosen the knot quickly and effectively
every single time when you're writing
something that isn't meant to be read by
anyone else don't simply cross it out
because you can still somewhat read the
message underneath instead it you should
scribble the number-8 all over your
secret message this way no one will be
able to decode it it also works really
well with numbers if you're writing down
any important card or security details
this next one is for the drivers out
there if you ever find yourself in a new
or higher car and you can't quite
remember which side the petrol cap is on
simply look on your dashboard as most
cars I have an arrow to indicate which
side it's on
I was mind-blowing when I found this out
I only see one of the most useful things
I've ever learned on the Internet this
one is a strange one but if the range of
your key fob is weak or you're just out
of range and you can't unlock your car
place the key to your head and extend
your arm towards the car this extends
the wave current and unlocks your car
honestly it works like magic
and the last one is a hack for reheating
your food you're probably just putting
your meal into the microwave as it is
however what you should be doing is
molding the food into a doughnut shape
like this with a hole in the middle
this will reheat your food much more
evenly and it won't have any of those
gross cold parts there are other bars of
the video I really hope you guys enjoyed
this and if you did make sure you smash
that thumbs up down below so I know I'm
to do more of these like life hack slash
things you've been doing wrong kind of
videos in the future I'm so excited for
one of you to wear the hair dyes because
honestly it's so much fun to play around
with your hair color like I said all we
have to do is be subscribed and follow
my Instagram and those are the only
rules so that is all from me I really
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
and I'll see you very soon in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
