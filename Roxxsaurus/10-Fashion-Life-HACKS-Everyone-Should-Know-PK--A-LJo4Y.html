different fashion hacks for you guys
which I like some really cool tips and
tricks to do with clothing and fashion
and stuff like that so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and without parody
let's just jump right into the video so
happy number one is if you want to avoid
getting at ladders and holes in your
tights you can spray them with some hair
spray beforehand am i doing this it will
just make your tight a little bit less
prone to getting hose and then
afterwards getting those terrible
ladders that just keep getting bigger
and bigger hack number two of course
getting holes in your tights is like
inevitable it could you get a hole and
you don't have any other tights to get
changed into but you just really want to
wear these tights then you can just use
some clear nail polish to go around the
edges of the hole and I'll just prevent
it from getting any bigger than it
already is hack number three it's
folding your clothing with this really
quick method that takes about two
seconds what you want to do is you want
to fold in a quarter of your top you
want to pinch the shoulder with your
right hand and pinch halfway down the
top with your left
next you swing over your right hand and
pinch the bottom of the top and pick the
shirt up
you then flip the top over and place it
down whilst folding at the other half of
the sleeve it takes a few tries to get
this right but once you get the hang of
it it's actually really simple and
really easy hack number four is to wrap
this kind of like stick deodorant which
looks like this onto the back of your
shoe to avoid getting blisters when you
have shoes that haven't been worn in yet
today are very stiff at the back usually
and that's where I tend to get this is
the most especially with high heels so
adding a little bit of this stuff to the
back is just going to make sure that
your foot doesn't rub so harshly against
the back of your shoe hack number five
if you don't have one of those
remove us to remove Harrell from your
clothing then you can always just wrap
some sellotape around your hand and just
Pat it on your clothes to get rid of any
hairs this is such a life saver when you
have pets in your house and your black
clothes are literally covered with white
hair all over if you have some leather
shoes and sometimes you get like little
scuffs on them or little stains you can
actually remove them really easy by just
using petroleum jelly and gently rubbing
the leather actually didn't have any
petroleum jelly so I just had a cheese
virgin coconut oil and it actually
worked just as well so what you should
do is take a small amount of that
coconut oil and just massage that into
the scuff and once you do that the scuff
should come right off after you wipe the
shoe with a cotton bug when you have
some sweaters and they start to get like
bubbly and you know you get those like
nasty horrible balls of fluff on your
jumper you can actually get rid of them
and revive your jumper all you need to
get rid of them is basically a razor a
shaving razor and what you want to do is
you generally want to brush it down at
your sweater and it should get rid of
all of those little balls and make your
sweater look like it's brainy
if you're shopping for trousers or jeans
or just any bottoms in general and you
don't have time to try them on in store
what you can actually do is try them on
around your neck this is going to sound
crazy but the circumference of your neck
is actually half the size of your waist
so I've got my regular pants that are
high-waisted that I wear all the time
and they fit me perfect what you wanna
do is you want to wrap them around your
neck like this and if they actually
touch then that means that your jeans
will fit I'm going to strangle myself a
little bit to show you this but if they
overlap like this then that means that
I'm going to be too big for you and if
they don't touch at all and you can't
get them to touch then there will be too
small fee and if you guys don't believe
me then actually go get a pair of jeans
that actually fits you and try it for
yourself because I was actually amazed
when I read this hat on the Internet if
she's a slightly too big
this is especially really helpful with
heels that you just can't let go of and
you want to wear them so badly but
they're that tiny little bit big for you
what you can actually do is stuff the
toe of your shoe with some newspaper or
tissue paper
I feel like tissue paper
little bit more comfortable and it will
just make sure that your foot fits three
snug into the shoe and doesn't kind of
like wobble about in the shoe of course
you have to like change the tissue paper
every time after you use it otherwise
it'll be really I'm hedging it but of
course if you just want to wear this
pair of shoes that slight you big on
like a one-off day then you can use this
trick and it will be really helpful and
hack number ten is to actually iron your
clothes with a hair straightener this
hat could be a little bit unpractical if
you have an iron already because
straightening it with a hair
straightener will take a little bit
longer than just ironing it with a
regular iron but if you don't have an
actual iron then this is like amazing
so those are all of my ten fashion hacks
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
just to quick this time I didn't think
of any of these hats myself I forget
things I thought of like two on my own
just out of my own head but most of them
were just inspiration drawn from
Pinterest and other internet places and
articles and stuff like that so yeah
these are like my original ideas I'm not
trying to claim any of these ideas
already thing so yeah that is all I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and if you
did then definitely give it a thumbs up
and subscribe because I'd love to have
you here I already have a wonderful day
and I will see you very soon in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
