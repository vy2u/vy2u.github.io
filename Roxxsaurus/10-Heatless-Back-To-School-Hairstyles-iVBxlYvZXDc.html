channel I hope you guys all well today
I've got 10 different heatless
back-to-school hairstyles for you guys
because I know how difficult it is to
come up with a new hairstyle every
single day for school sometimes just
like inspiration and you forget about
how many awesome hairstyles that
actually are well you don't need to use
heat at all before we don't straight
into this video I wanna let you guys
know that I'm doing a huge
back-to-school giveaway this month so
make sure you are subscribed so you
don't miss that and I'm going to be
giving away a bunch of station roots
back to school and makeup and I've also
just decided this but I'm going to be
giving away a MacBook Pro which is a
huge deal so make sure you are
subscribed for that
stay tuned for that is coming very soon
but without further adieu let's use your
breakthrough video so the first hair
cell requires you to have a split middle
parting and what we're going to do is
take a chunk of hair just by our face
and start reading this in a fishtail
braid once you have rated the majority
of your hair you just want to secure
that with a clear elastic tie either
just want to pull apart your braid to
give her that messy texture and a load
of volume once your braid looks
something like this you just want to
repeat the same thing to the other side
so once you have your two fishtail
braids like this that you want to take
them to the back of your head and tie
those together and you can then remove
the two hair ties at the back which are
no longer needed and that is the
finished hairstyle done I love this hair
so much it looks so bohemian and it
looks like you put loads and loads of
effort into it when it actually took you
about five minutes so this next
hairstyle you actually need a side
parting so I'm just going to flip this
half of my hair over to the side you
want to grab a chunk of hair from the
front of your face split this into two
sections and twist it once once you've
twisted it one so you want to add
another set
hair from the back and add that into the
twist
once you've twisted it again you want to
add another chunk of hair on the back
and add that into the twist as well you
want to keep doing this until you get to
the back of your head once you get to
the back of your head you want to secure
the twist with a clear elastic tie to a
section of the loose hair at the back of
your head and even if you wanted to you
can also take this section of your hair
and twist this as well to reach the back
of your head but I just like the rope
twist on one side of the head I think
it's super cute
the next hairstyle is a messy top bun
that we need to do for this is gather
the top section of your hair I usually
go for where my eyebrows are and I just
basically put two thumbs through my hair
meet them at the back and just gather
this whole section next what you want to
do is take a hair tie and tie your
ponytail in place and then once you have
your ponytail you want to form this into
a top knot bun and that is the top knot
hair settled up I really like this
variation of the top knot bun for the
half up to half downs you kind of hair
stuff it's not sticking right at the top
of your head which makes it really
wearable and casual for every day for
the next hair so you again want to have
a middle parting and take two sections
of hair from the front of your face so
you want to take these two sections of
hair twist them and secure them at the
back of your head you don't want to take
another two sections of hair from the
front of your face
twist them again and secure them at the
back of your head just below the first
hair tie you don't want to keep
repeating this step until there is no
more hair to twist and you are finished
with a braid and that is the finished
hairstyle done I think it is looks so
cool it looks like you've put hours and
hours into this hairstyle when really
all you've been doing is repeating the
same process over and over again and it
probably took you like six minutes full
this NYX has tell you again what to take
two sections of hair just on the front
of your face and twist them towards the
back of your head once you have your two
twists at the back of your head you want
to take those two sections and start
braiding them in a fishtail braid once
you have finished braiding you want to
secure that in place with a clear
elastic tie so again this is the
finished look I love how this hairstyle
turned out and it's super simple but
really cute the next Tessa is a shout
out to my girl
arrey she is the queen of this hair stop
so what you want to do for this one is
take the top section of your hair and
gather this up into a high ponytail
once you have to let you want to secure
this into a high ponytail right at the
top of your head and this is the
finished hairstyle you can also take a
strand of hair and wrap this around the
hair tie to concealer this is the final
hairstyle of its so so much and I can
totally see why I really Randy rocks
this so much because it's adorable
for this next hairstyle you again want
to take t-shirts of hair from the front
of your face but this time slightly
thinner and then you will have to take
them to the back of your head and cross
them over and pin them in place once you
have secured your hair in place you want
to start a new strands from each side to
create the crisscross effect and that is
the finished hair stop it super super
simple it takes about a minute to do and
it looks really chic and classy from the
back but this next test are you also
going to take two strands of hair from
the front of your face and secure them
at the back of your head you then want
to split the little ponytail that you've
created into two sections and tie them
together into almost a knot once you
have tied at once
tie it again and this is going to create
an almost pretzel like bun and the rest
of the hair sticking out of this you can
tuck underneath and the strands as you
can see I'm doing here all there is left
to do after that is securing the whole
thing into place so that it doesn't
unravel and fall out and you are good to
go
this hairstyle is really quick and
simple to do but it looks super unique
and unusual but this next one we're
going to be starting off with a same
little ponytail that we've created at
the back of our head in our previous
hairstyle and this time we're going to
be adding another hair tie a few
centimeters below the first one we're
then going to split that section of hair
between the two hair ties into two and
fold this in half as you can see that
I'm doing here you don't want to pin
this in place to fold over where the two
hair ties meet and before you know where
you have created a really cute hair bow
at the back of your head
the last thing to do is secure that in
place up so that it doesn't untie
throughout the day and that is the
hairstyle finished and for this last
hair cell we're going to be creating a
faux braid on the side of our hair so
for this I'm going to gather my hair
into a side ponytail like this and just
tie this in place next what you want to
do is create a little gap in your hair
and loop your ponytail through this once
you may want to take a clear elastic tie
and tie this a few centimeters below our
first hair tie and do the same thing to
this so you want to create a little loop
and then loop the ponytail through we're
just going to do this once more add a
clear elastic tie to the end create a
little gap and then loop our pony tough
room so this is what our faux fishtail
braid should look like it's super simple
and with this technique you don't really
need to know how to fishtail break
anyway but it looks pretty legit so that
is all for my ten heatless
back-to-school hairstyles I really hope
