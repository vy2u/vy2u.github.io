hope you guys are having an awesome day
so far in today's video I am going to be
showing you guys how to achieve this
makeup look for back-to-school film I
haven't done a makeup tutorial is
literally forever so I have a returned I
absolutely love this makeup look it's
pretty much like my go-to and I feel
like it'll be perfect for school and I
pretty much used almost every product
that's drugstore there's a few products
that are high-end but predominantly the
products in this video are going to be
drugstore but that is enough rambling
without further ado let's get on into
the video so you two start off at the
makeup look today I'm actually gonna
start off with my eyes because I feel
like when you're rushing for school in
the morning sometimes you can really
mess up and if the rest of your makeup
is done like your foundation or your
concealer you really don't want to take
those off as well and start from scratch
so it's good to have the eyes done first
and out of the way so I'm actually going
to be starting off with the Rimmel
London eye palette and this is called
the magnifies nude edition it has
literally every single shade you could
think of from des loges all the way down
to night looks so this is like a really
perfect all-rounder kind of palette it's
got lots of maps lots of shimmers but
today we're actually going to be
focusing on the matte shades because for
school you want something a little bit
more neutral and more natural-looking
the first shade I'm actually going to
take today is the third one here and
this is like the perfect matte shadow to
use in the crease I'm just taking that
only big fluffy brush and I'm just
blending that into the crease this is
going to give like a nice subtle depth
to the lid and it's also going to make
all of the other shadows and blend in so
much easier absolutely love these
eyeshadows so much it has literally no
fallout at all and that's exactly what
you want from eyes shadows especially
for back-to-school because you know you
don't want to be like faffing around
with my shadows like falling all over
your face next i shadow i'm gonna take
is this one here and it's like a light
brown kind of color it's matte once
again so I'm gonna pick that up on the
same brush and I'm just going to blend
this further into the crease but only
focusing it on the outer corner just to
give a little bit more depth that we
don't want this look to be overboard we
still want it to look quite natural
and like you're barely wearing any
makeup and I know a lot of you guys are
gonna appreciate that because there's a
lot of schools out there who don't allow
you to wear makeup so I'm just doing
this tutorial bearing that in mind I'm
also going to pull that brown eyeshadow
just underneath my lash line and just
again focusing that in the outer corner
only I'm now gonna take the lightest
color from the palette which is this one
here and it's a light kind of whitish
matte color and I'm just going to pick
that up on the brush that came with the
palette and I'm going to pop this in the
very inner corners of my eyes if you
guys struggle from having like tired
looking eyes I don't get a bit of
brightness to the inner corners of your
eyes that literally does wonders and if
you guys are like staying up late on a
school night this will literally be your
lifesaver so now that we have finished
with the eyes as you can see they're
very like minimal looking we're gonna
add a little bit of eyeliner so I'm
gonna be using the Rimmel London wonder
winged eyeliner this eyeliner is
actually really interesting because the
tip is felt but it has like a stamp kind
of thing on the end if you guys look up
real close you can see it it basically
allows you to accrete a wing much easier
than any other felt tip liner so what
you're supposed to do is use the flat
end of the eyeliner and just stamp that
onto at the skin and as you can see that
gave me a really small wing obviously
we're going to make this more precise so
I'm just filling that wing in I think
the school makeup using a felt tip liner
is actually probably the easiest way to
apply eyeliner because it's so easy to
control and I absolutely swear by felt
tip liner
and as you can see this is the eyeliner
finish you guys obviously know that I
can't live without a winged liner and I
tried to make it a little bit smaller a
little bit more subtle so it's a little
bit more wearable for school and the
mascara that I'm gonna be using today is
this one here which is called the
wonderfully real mascara this is perfect
for those of you who want to achieve
that false lash look without the lashes
actually looking fake I really love the
wand of this mascara as well because it
really captures every single lash even
those tiny ones hiding in the corners
look at those lashes I absolutely love
this mascara it adds a lot of length and
volume to my lashes but without them
looking at clumpy and I'm also gonna add
a little bit of mascara just on my
bottom lashes as well but now I'm gonna
move on to my eyebrows they're looking a
little bit sparse so they definitely
need a little bit of help so for my
eyebrows I'm gonna use my Anastasi dip
brow pomade in shade blonde and I'm just
going to use this to kind of fill and
fix up any of my sparse areas and what I
like to do is I just like to go
underneath the brow first and then what
I like to do is actually turn it the
brush vertically and just create little
brushstrokes to make it look like actual
eyebrow hairs and now I'm going to try
and repeat the same thing to my other
eyebrow now don't be too disheartened if
you can't get your eyebrows to match
perfectly brows aren't meant to be twins
and they're meant to be sisters so now
that my brows are looking nice and full
we can move on to my actual skin so to
begin I imagine gonna be using at this
Anna Tsui creamy foundation at primer
you can use any primer from the
drugstore that you like these are
literally a lifesaver they make your
foundation is so much smoother and I
swear by primers I'm just going to rub
that into my skin just to smooth it out
and prime it for the foundation the
foundation I'm going to use today is
this one from new look I've actually
tested this out in a video before and I
actually quite liked it at the moment
I've been really using this a lot lately
and it's a matte foundation and then
just going to use my big iconic face
brush and I'm just going to blend this
in
to my face to get a nice even complexion
to conceal my under eyes and just any
blemishes I've got a little facie when
going on here I'm actually gonna use
this Pro conceal concealer by Ella girl
and this is in shade a light ivory it
actually has a slight orange you kind of
tint to it so it's perfect for your
under eyes any orange tones in
concealers really cancel out the
darkness and the pigments up and under
eye I'm just gonna dab that on any
blemishes that I have on my face so I'm
just going to blend my under-eye
concealer with this brush eyes you're
going to drag that concealer all the way
to the top like into my hairline because
I feel like that really lifts your face
and also highlight at the same time so
that is my foundation and concealer
finish I think it looks pretty good and
I'm now gonna move on to a powder
contouring so for my contour I'm gonna
be using this new look palette and it's
got three different shades of contour
actually has a highlight a medium shade
and in a dark shade so I'm gonna be
taking the dark shade on this little
contour brush and with this I'm just
going to be adding a little bit of
definition to my cheekbones just to add
a little bit of shape back into the face
I'm also going to take this contour up
into the temple and the forehead and
just to make it all blend together
seamlessly if your face is still looking
a little bit oily you can set it in
place to make your makeup last all day
long and for this I'm going to use the
Too Faced primed and poreless loose
powder packaging is so cute
I'm so I'm just gonna take a little bit
of that and you can use anything you can
use like a drugstore powder they're just
as good and I'm just going to be taking
that underneath my eyes on a big kind of
like a dome brush this is just to make
sure that you make of it does not slide
off of your face during the day I also
forgot my favorite part the blush duh so
today I'm gonna be using a lot a London
and this is from the drugstore and this
is the blush crush powder blusher in
shade same look how pretty that is
ever done in there but please ignore
that I'm just gonna take that on a real
techniques brush and just lightly dust
that onto the apples of my cheeks I'm
now gonna take my favorite highlighting
palette whole time and that is the Glo
kit by Anastasia Beverly Hills you guys
know I am literally in love with this so
I'm gonna be taking the shade mmm summer
I feel like this is a really pretty
shade for literally anyone any skin
tones I'm just gonna pick some of that
up and pop it onto my cheekbone that is
so pretty I literally like conquer over
it every time I apply it hey I'm that
glow I'm also gonna take a teensy weensy
brush like this and just apply some of
that highlighter just a tiny bit so the
tip of my nose now lastly moving on to
the lips I'm gonna take my trusty Rimmel
cappuccino lip liner this is one of my
favorite and it should use it every
single day and I'm just going to lightly
align my lips with this and to finish
off the lips I'm gonna be using this
models own lipstick in shade naked at
0-5 and I'm just going to dab this onto
my lip just to make it a little bit more
wearable and not so bold
so this is the finished makeup look I
absolutely love how this turned out I
think that it's really neutral and like
wearable for every day but there's also
like that slight glam because obviously
I just couldn't help myself
you can definitely tone it down if you
can't wear this amount of makeup like I
get that it's a little bit out there
with the glow and like the winged liner
but I feel like it's still really
wearable for every single day and this
is genuinely like my go-to everyday
