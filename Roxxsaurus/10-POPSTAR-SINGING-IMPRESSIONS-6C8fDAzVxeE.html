channel I hope you guys are well today
as you can tell it from the title I'm
doing a slightly different video than I
usually do I'm kind of a little bit
scared about it but I thought it would
be fun so I'm gonna do it anyway just a
quick disclaimer I have to say I'm not
like the greatest singer I have never
had any singing lessons and I'm not
trying to say I sound like any of these
celebrities that I'm about to
impersonate it's fun to do different
voices and I am going to try my best
attempt at it if you guys enjoyed this
video please be sure to give a thumbs up
and subscribe to this channel as well as
my blog Charlie for new do message erase
the video that's a neat permission in
that decision to test my limits when so
easily say goodbye news when you walk
out that door don't you come back no
more
my heart is had nothing giving me the
cushion
maybe not quit let's pretend we're
running out of time and now that I can
you so I'm putting my defenses I think a
heart attack you can take everything
have you can break everything I am like
I'm made of glass like all the barn
boardbarn marcado is gonna be I know
it's gonna bitch in two ways we fall
into the river the dark is too hard to
be but in front to mention you hope
their minds
I'm ready to go lead me into the line
for you man me I also write the things
what kind of heavy
oh how I wish that I was looking into
your when you let your heart win whoa
you'll take away my pride no not this
time
there are they come so long my spirits
tear to like hold until you find it be
gradually love friends here - really
your darkest moments and for all the
 fled
no don't no day I'm always in this
Twilight in the shadow of your heart
sinner like me baby you gave up you gave
up LIF you broke I can't believe I
looked at me with your James ding glassy
eyes will you still love me when I'm no
longer young and
beautiful besides all make me cry come
take a walk I'll go outside let me kiss
you hard in the pouring rain you like
your girls insane my god look at that
face you look like my next mistake loves
a game wanna play let's be friends I'm
dying to see how this one ends or it's
gonna go down play and will I learn
down shits ah ah how do you do this so
that is all for my impersonations I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and found it
entertaining
I know memes are my saying that I sound
like any of these people or that I think
I'm good because I also don't think I'm
great at singing if you didn't enjoy it
please be sure to give it a thumbs up

all from me I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I'll see you very soon
in my next video bye
very gloopy I'm kind of scared to go
anywhere near my eye because when it
starts bubbling it's gonna bubble into
my eye

face is already chubby now it's like all
fluffy and bubbly I don't know just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
