video as you can tell by my lipstick and
my top I am clearly ready to talk about
periods periods is something every girl
goes through and I feel like it's not
talked about enough so I decided to film
at 10 different period hacks for you
guys to help you out and you know make
appearance a little bit more bearable
these are just a few tips and tricks
that I personally feel like really work
for me so I thought I would share them
with you guys if you guys would like to
see more hack videos in the future and
find this video helpful make sure you
smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and if you haven't seen at my face
before hi I'm Roxy I come and join the
dinosaur family by subscribing it down
below both a bummer and bling let's get
on into the video okay so the first hag
is to predict your periods without
having to memorize when you were last on
your period you can actually use an app
now the one that I use is called natural
cycles and you can actually also use
this as a contraception method this is
actually our first and only certified it
app out there which makes it so much
more reliable to use it's super easy to
use you simply input your cycle
information and update it regularly the
more data you input the more accurate
your predictions will be you can get a
yearly subscription for only about
$39.99 in the UK if you're over 18 which
in my opinion is actually quite a fair
price in general being without pills and
hormones for me personally is definitely
the better choice with the yearly
subscription that you also get a little
thermometer in the box that you can use
every morning to measure your
temperature and just jot it down into
the app that when you wake up you want
to enter the data into the app and it
will tell you which days are secure
which will be in the green color and
which days are insecure which will be in
red so not only can you track your
period and know exactly when you're
going to be on but you can also predict
when you can get pregnant and when
you're not fertile which is a great
bonus hi number two is perfect for those
of you guys who often a struggle
sleeping because of like period cramps
that are absolutely painful so to make
the bedtime a little bit more bearable
what I actually do is I take a sped
duvet and I just roll it up into like a
really huge a long burrito basically I
use that as much as snuggle pillow I
just literally pop my leg over and the
position that I sleep in
with the use of this like pillow burrito
is actually so much better because I can
elevate my leg which relieves the
tension off of my uterus I don't know if
this is actually like scientifically
proven but it really works for me
whenever I lift my leg up over something
it just relieves the pain so mark though
if you guys are ever struggling and
whilst you're sleeping and you're in a
lot of pain and nothing's working then
maybe try this and it might work for you
the next life hack is actually making
your own a heat pack - it used when
you're either at home or in bed or just
lounging on the sofa he packs are
actually quite expensive and you can
totally a DIY one yourself with
literally the things you already have at
home do what you want to do is take a
sock I know it's really weird but just a
random salt and take some rice pour it
into the sock and then pop that in the
microwave
literally it creates an instant heat
pack which you can just pop over your
belly
whenever you watching TV or if you're in
bed and it will really relieve the pain
now a hack number four is actually
wearing a bikini bottoms instead of your
usual
underwear whilst you're on your period
now this sounds kind of crazy and a
little bit uncomfortable but when you
think about it you definitely don't want
to ruin it your usual underwear
and if you have a worried about leaking
which I totally I'm always paranoid
about that I think that this would
really benefit you if you're at school
or at work or just any public place
because you're definitely not gonna need
for a bikini bottom since it is so thick
in material now the next hack I actually
think I saw in Pinterest and I literally
was like is this is genius so basically
what you want to do is make a little
pocket in your underwear for a period
pad or a tampon and that way it's always
there with you I don't know if I you
guys but sometimes when I was at school
I would always be like very
self-conscious about taking a period pad
or a tampon out with my bag and taking
it to the bathroom because I felt like
everyone was watching me and everyone
knew that it was that time of the month
so what you want to do is take a tiny
bit of the material from literally
anything it could be an old top an old
t-shirt whatever I'm gonna cut out a
little pocket and then hot glue gun this
onto your actual underwear you can
stitch it if you want but I'm gonna take
the easy way out and just glue it make
sure it's big enough for the seventh
towel or the tampon to be able to pop
that inside and literally you'll have
this on you anytime and you'll be able
to use it in that document if you're not
so crafty and you don't want to take it
that way out you can also hide your
tampon or a carried pad in a pair of
boots if you're wearing some and let's
you just pop it in in the morning and
then when you go to school or work it's
always gonna be there and no one will
ever know the next line is hike I feel
like it's so self-explanatory and
everyone says is all the time but just
drinking lots of water will really
improve like your period cramps I know
it can be kind of difficult to drink a
lot of water in one day and really push
yourself especially if you're not a big
water drinker so what I find helps me is
actually going out to the store and
buying like a really pretty tumbler or a
sippy cup or anything like that and it's
making me want to drink water and also
the fact that it has a straw I feel like
we have a straw it makes you drink so
much quicker and so much more so if
you're one of those people who are
trying to force themselves to drink a
lot of water and you're finding it
really difficult try this and I feel
like getting a sippy cup or a tumbler
will definitely help you if you guys
ever find yourselves
popping them pills and missing nothing
is helping the cramps what you should
try is actually a bit of acupressure I
think that's how you pronounce it
basically what you do is you just press
firmly onto this part of your hand and
rub in like a circular motion I know
this sounds kind of weird but it totally
works basically this muscle of your hand
is responsible for the uterine muscles
so if you actually just massage this and
stimulate it it's really going to relax
of the uterus and make it calmed and you
know just relieve the pressure in the
pain and also it will treat your
headaches which is definitely a bonus
I've tried this method quite a few times
and I feel like it kind of whacks
I don't know about you guys but let me
know down below if you guys that try it
and if it works for you the next tag is
for trying to get to sleep a little bit
quicker and I know this can be super
difficult especially if you're in your
period but what I find that that really
helps and get me to sleep really quick
is actually using
lavender essential oils what I do is I
actually pop a few drops onto my pillow
before I go to sleep and I feel like
this scent just really calms me and for
me this helps me get to see both so much
quicker and the last hack is actually
wearing a pair of really cozy socks and
when you're going to sleep I know that
some people hate wearing socks to bed
but I'm one of those people who wear
socks to bed all year round is that just
me let me know down below so I feel like
I'm kind of weird I don't know if this
is gonna work for everyone and just put
it out there but it totally works for me
and I've been doing this literally all
my life so those were all of my period
hacks I really hope you guys enjoyed
them and found them helpful I really do
hope that this house at least one of you
girls out there periods are very rarely
talked about and they're literally such
an important thing that every girl
struggles with so I thought I would you
know just come back and talk to you guys
about some period hags once again I will
say it in this video last year so if you
guys haven't seen that I'll pop it in
the little I just found also feel free
to follow me on my social media and just
here I'm just at rock sores on
everything but that is all from me I
really hope you guys enjoy today's video
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye
