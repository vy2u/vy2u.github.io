channel I hope you guys are doing simple
hourly first I'm going to address the
elephant in the room
yes I have pink hair we just take a
moment to talk about my pink hair
I am completely loving it like it's so
cool like ìokay cat there is going to
be a full video all about this hair
color and how I achieved it after
becoming at some point next week so
let's kind of just ignore this situation
for now and the most of these purposes
this video it's a today's video is not a
beauty hack videos you guys love my hack
videos on this channel and obviously I
love making them survive in the eyes a
little bit difficult enough to think of
a very original hat that hasn't been
done before it's kind of like a mind the
mind attack has been completely emptied
there is no gold in the mind of hacks
but you guys know me I always tried to
achieve the last hat out of the gold
mine and today I've got some a new hat
you guys that are beauty related and I
want to do really really excited to
share them with you guys
89 enjoy this video make sure you smash
that key thumbs up just down below
let's try and give this video to 30,000
likes I think we can do it you guys okay
you know how does this card is the
animation you do the button is just down
below
I put twice a week if you don't want to
keep up with my videos and make sure you
click the subscribe button is enough
rambling let's get into the video so
hack number one is for those of you who
are really enjoying the faux freckled
trend at the moment what you guys can
actually do is take some fake tan and a
toothbrush and dip the toothbrush in the
fake tan and then kind of flick the face
scan onto your skin and this will create
very natural-looking freckles you can
also take the toothbrush and actually
dub that onto the skin for some modified
freckles
this is a super simple yet effective
hack which will last for a few days kind
of number two is for faking a no makeup
look but defining your lashes at the
same time what you can actually do is
take a felt tip liner and just brush
that through your lashes this will
darken them quite a bit but it will look
like you're not actually wearing any
makeup
the next hack is for applying your
foundation more evenly we are always
told to dab a Beautyblender into the
skin to blend out your foundation but
what you should actually try is rolling
the foundation into your skin not only
does this spread the foundation much
better into the skin whilst not
absorbing all the foundation into the
sponge but it also gives you a really
nice a blended finish the next hack is
forgetting even eyeliner sometimes we
struggle at getting the angle of the
wing right but if you actually create
two dots at the same angle and then draw
your liner afterwards this will ensure
that the angle of your liner is always
identical to each other hack number five
is definitely one of my favorites if you
happen to have a mascara that leaves
your lashes really clumpy because of the
brush what you should actually do is
when you pull out the mascara try
tilting it an angle and then pulling out
this will remove the excess mascara off
of the brush and making sure that your
lashes are not clumped the next tag is
forgetting those install ready brows the
trick behind the fade brows is to make
sure that the edge of the brow in the
inner corner is not harsh what you want
to do is actually fade out and blend
away the brow product in the inner
corner like so this one looks really
messy for a while but don't worry we're
going to clean it up later
once the brows are nicely faded you want
to take some concealer and just outline
at the very center of your eyebrows once
you've done that you can blend away the
concealer and blend that into the fade
brows at the beginning of your brow and
lastly you want to set your brows with
some a translucent powder this will
really set your eyebrows in place and
make sure that they are very nice and
matte which will look really nice in
photos if you happen to have any makeup
brushes where the bristles are actually
quite stiff what you can do is actually
just wash them in your normal shampoo
and conditioner this will really soften
the bristles and make them much more
softer to the touch if you're ever
struggling to get your middle passing
even you might be doing it a bit too
slow the slower you do it the more
inaccurate it's going to be what you
should be doing is creating your parting
really quickly with just one stroke and
this will make sure that the parting is
really nice and even
the next hack is a self-tanning hack if
you find your tan looking quite patchy
what you should be doing is mixing some
moisturizer into your self-tanner as
well and then applying this to the skin
another hack is to actually use a
foundation brush to blend in your
self-tanner into those spots where it's
a little bit more tricky to get an even
blend like your hands or wrists or elbow
using a foundation brush will make sure
that the tan is really nicely even and
not patchy and the last pack is making
your own eyeliner stencil all you need
for this is a bit of cardboard that you
just want to cut out and eyeliner shape
into you don't want to pop this onto
your eye and start drawing out your
eyeliner when you take away the stencil
you'll be left with a really nice clean
shade this is really great because you
can reuse it and it's going to be
exactly even on both of the eyes so
those are all of my beauty hacks I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
