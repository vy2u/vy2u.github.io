line I'll make up the so crease makes me
look ten times older and now just a damn
foundation oh that's quite a lot and I
like put it back you know that's such a
waste it did it today just apply my
favorite lipstick and then this happens
did I just do matching your eye line

feel when you're using a liquid liner
and it hasn't dried yet perfect
