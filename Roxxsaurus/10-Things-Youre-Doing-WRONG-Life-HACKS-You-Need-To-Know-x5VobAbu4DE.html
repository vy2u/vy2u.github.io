well today I have another life hack for
you for you guys and today I'm going to
be doing 10 things that you might be
doing wrong don't worry you're not alone
I do a lot of these things wrong myself
so what I found this online I was like
oh my gosh what have I been doing on my
life if you guys enjoyed this video
please be sure to give it a huge thumbs
up and just over there and if you are
new and you have never seen my face
before the subscribe button is just down
below I heard that if you click the
subscribe button
a unicorn will fly across your screen
but without further ado let's jump right
into the video okay so the first thing
you guys might be doing wrong into
eating your potato chips or snacks wrong
so sometimes when you've been having a
few too many potato chips or crisps you
are caught red-handed especially if
you're eating Cheetos as soon as you
pull out your hand out of the package
your hand is literally covered in orange
residue from your snack so to avoid this
from happening what you can actually do
is roll up the bottom of your crisp
packet and this will make sure that all
of your snacks are pushed up to the top
so you don't have to reach in all the
way into the packet to get out your
crisps this just makes this next much
more easy to access and also mix less
mess you are welcome the next one is
another snack related hack so basically
when a lot of us are eating snacks we
never really finished the packet all the
way especially if it's a big packet so
to avoid getting stale crisps we usually
roll up the packet but it never actually
stays it always on rolls and opens again
so if you don't have like a little clip
to clip your packet in place what you
can do is actually roll up your packet
without any clips in the soft origami
kind of way so what you want to do is
roll up the opening of your packet twice
flip the bag around onto the other side
and fold in the corners of each side and
once that's done you want to flip the
whole thing inside out so this will make
sure that you packet is sealed and it
won't open and make sure that your
crisps don't go stale the next one is
literally genius so when you guys are
removing the leaves off of a strawberry
you usually use your fingers it makes so
much worse it's actually quite difficult
to rip off the leaves sometimes so what
you want to do is actually take a straw
and then you just want to piss that
through the whole strawberry all the way
through and this will remove the leaves
for you this will not only remove the
leaves but also in the center of the
strawberry which can be a little bit
hard sometimes this next one is holding
carton of juice and the right way this
isn't necessarily the right way to do it
I think it's quite cool especially for
children so you might as well try it
it's the kinds of juice sometimes have
these little tabs on the side which can
flip up I never knew about this but
there's no tabs you can actually hold
onto and drink your juice that way this
is amazing especially for little
children because sometimes kids can
squish the carton of juice and the juice
will just go everywhere whereas if they
hold the juice by the little tabs
they're not going to squeeze anything
out and cause any mess whatsoever so you
know where you're cooking and you have
the wooden spoon and you kind of like
done with it so you don't really know
what to do with it don't know whether to
put it on the side or whether to keep it
in the pot so you know the little hole
that you have on the end of the handle
of your cooking pot well you can
actually pop in your spoon into that
hole and it will hold it in place if you
guys are anything like me in hating
sandwiches that have like nothing
covered on the edges of the sandwich
that is like a biggest pet peeve ever I
hate that so much so for those of you
who are the same with the tack is for
you when you are preparing the sandwich
instead of putting it just on top of the
sandwich and having all the edges around
bad or you can actually do is use two
slices split them in half and organize
the slices with the flat edge against
the edge of your sandwich as you can see
there is no bare bread and you can now
enjoy the sandwich Authority if you guys
ever think that your laptop is a little
bit quieter and you want that little bit
of a boost to it or you can actually do
is cut a plastic cup in half and place
them over your speakers like so the cup
around it will amplify the sound and
make it much louder if you guys are ever
struggling with having a not so nice
smelling bathroom what you can actually
do is pop in some essential oil into the
cardboard bit of your toilet roll and as
long as the thurible is that and it
hasn't been used up the scent will seep
through into the toilet paper and make
your bathroom smell really nice the next
one might be one that you guys have
heard of before but I'm gonna include it
in this video anyways in case you
haven't so you know how a soda can has
that little tab with a hole inside and
usually it's just for opening but
sometimes you wonder where there's a
hole inside what that hole is actually
for is to place it your straw through
when you're drinking you can of soda so
I'll just keep destroying place rather
than floating out of your soda can and
the last one is a good old hack that
I've been using quite a lot throughout
my life and that is basically using a
club spinner to hammer in
and now so what you want to do is take a
nail and hold it up by a close-in and
then hammer that in this will just make
sure that your precious little fingers
don't get stopped by the hammer and that
is all for this video I really hope you
