channel I hope you guys are all well
yeah I've got I'll have video for you
guys and I've done a lot of these beauty
hat early to cut a video so if you guys
are interested I'll leave them all
listed down in the description below so
in this video I'm going to be showing
with you some really useful tips and
tricks when it comes to eyebrows
I know eyebrows can be a little bit
tricky today we're a girl I've got you
if you are new and you have never seen
my face before please be sure to
subscribe to this channel as well as my
blog channel which is called rocks or as
vlogs and follow me on my social media
because why not
my Twitter Instagram and snapchat at all
rocks or is the same way that's about
here so that poverty let's jump right
into the video
so the first hack is for those annoying
and obnoxious sparse areas in your brows
so strangely enough using a concealer
fixes this problem so you want to add
some concealer to the sparse areas of
your eyebrows and then set this with
your regular eye brow powder the
concealer will almost act as an adhesive
for the eyebrow powder which will make
it much more pigmented and
longer-lasting
when your eyebrows get us both she and
as unruly as mine all you need is a pair
of scissors and a spoolie so you want to
brush your eyebrows up and then really
carefully trim your eyebrows this will
make sure that your eyebrows are just
much more manageable and this way then
won't droop down at your arch the next
hack is to achieve the faded eyebrow in
a really really easy way so you want to
apply the product to the arch in the
middle of your eyebrow and then using a
flat brush you want to blend this
inwards into the inner corner of your
eyebrow and this will just create a
really soft and natural transition and
create that really on trend faded brow
eyebrow hacksaw is actually using a
regular eye palette for your eyebrows so
you don't need to go out and spend a lot
of money on expensive eyebrow kits and
things like that because nine times out
of ten you probably already own an
eyeshadow that you can use for your
eyebrows if you're ever struggling with
plucking your eyebrows and it's so so
painful try applying a bit of teething
cream for babies on to your eyebrows
because it has numbing properties in it
so it will temporarily numb your skin
and make it easier for you to pop your
eyebrows hack number six is for those
dark days when you have run out of your
eyebrow gel so instead of using your
eyebrow gel you can actually use a
hairspray it's a really strange hack but
it's been around for quite some time but
it works wonders you know how sometimes
you over to your brows and they turn out
really dark and almost look sharp Ede
well actually a really good hack is that
you can lighten them up with just your
face powder so you want to kind of crush
a little bit of face powder with your
spoolie and then brush that through your
eyebrows and this will rescue your
Sharpedo eyebrows and make them appear
lighter
hack number eight the spoon eyebrow hack
that I'll have seen everywhere so what
you want to do is use the arch of the
spoon and place that directly underneath
the arch of your eyebrow and then trace
along at the edge of the spoon and this
will give you a really sharp and
clean-cut eyebrow I'm actually surprised
this really works
hack number nine is old but gold and
that's using a concealer to clean up
your eyebrow it's such a
self-explanatory hack but I felt like it
needed to be included because it does
literally save my life every day and the
last hack is using two different eyebrow
powders to create a faded brown look so
you want to use a lighter color at the
beginning of your brow and then a darker
towards the arch and end of your brow to
create a natural-looking faded effect so
there's all the other hats I have for
you guys I hope you guys enjoyed them
and sorry about my eyebrows by the way
they're looking a bit cray-cray they've
been through a lot throughout this video
I hope this has helped some of you guys
I know they have definitely helped me
through my eyebrow journey so I wish
when I was younger I've had someone tell
me leave because maybe then my eyebrows
would have had such a tragic journey if
you enjoyed this video please be sure to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to
this channel as well as my blog channel
if you're new I hope you guys are having
a wonderful day and I'll see you very
soon in my next video bye
