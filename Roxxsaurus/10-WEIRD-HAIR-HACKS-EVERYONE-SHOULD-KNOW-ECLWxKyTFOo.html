channel I hope you guys are all well
today as you can tell from the title
I've got a hair hack video for you guys
I have done lots of other hack videos
which I'll link or down in the
description below if you guys are doing
this type of video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to this channel
as well as my blog channel if you're new
and also at the end of this video I'm
gonna be announcing the winner of my
huge 1 million giveaway video so that's
super exciting and make sure you stay
till the end but for now let's jump
right into the video
so hack number 1 is basically braiding
your hair every single night before you
go to bed I actually have been doing
this every single night for about two
years without fail and it just makes
sure that my hair doesn't get tambour
throughout my sleep and also when you
wake up you have the most gorgeous
heatless ways and if you guys see my
hair now it's got a slight wave to it
and this is basically how I achieve that
slight texture to my hair so it's not
dead straight heck number two is I think
one that has been featured in one of my
previous hack videos and that is
basically to gather all of you get into
a high ponytail and then curl all the
ends this is a really quick way to curl
all of your hair without having to go
through each strand because all you have
to do is take chunks of your hair and
curl them at a time and even though it
takes like so much less time you are
still left with the same result which is
super awesome because don't we all want
to save time in the mornings when we are
doing I have yes we do Pepa number three
is cutting your own so that ends at home
and go freak out I know you guys are
gonna be like oh you should cut your
hair at home blah blah blah but I've
been doing this for years and you just
have to be really really careful you
have to use really sharp scissors so you
don't actually create more split ends by
using blood ones and by this I mean
don't use paper scissors so basically
what you wanna do is take a strand of
hair like this and then just start
twisting it on itself and this is just
going to reveal all of your split ends I
have so many split ends that basically
divorced oh so funny
but basically this is what you do and
then you take your scissors and it just
cuts off all of the split ends you don't
want to go ham you don't want to cut one
of your hair but just be a reasonable
you know I just cut off all the bits
that you think need cutting and those
basically what I do and another
technique you can do is take a strand of
hair and kind of like wrap it around
your finger like this and then when you
pull down the length of your hair it
should reveal all of the sleds from that
strand just to cut off your split ends
you don't need to go to the
hairdresser's and spend loads of money
when you can just do at home the next
tag is kind of weird and that is using a
simple cotton bud like this to actually
remove the oil and grease from your hair
I know it sounds crazy but basically
what you want to do is you want to
separate your cotton bud into two
sections so you reveal this really
fluffy coat of the cotton bud and then
what you want to do is basically rub
this on to your roots like this and the
really fluffy cotton bud will basically
absorb any excess oil in your hair that
is making your hair look quite shiny and
greasy so if you want to go that one
more day without washing your hair but
you don't have a dry shampoo this is a
really easy fix and it actually works I
have to say I can feel like the oil kind
of disappearing from my hand it looks a
little bit less greasy and I out on my
third day hair so looking good and extra
happy is retaining your obnoxious
flyaways I have so many other root of my
hair it's really annoying so we all know
the very common toothbrush and hairspray
hair but today I'm actually going to be
showing you something slightly different
and today instead of toothbrush we're
going to be using a kabuki brush or just
any major brush that you want so you
basically lend you the same thing you
want to spray your kabuki brush with
your hair spray and then you just want
to brush this bad boy onto your roots
this is going to go gently pat down your
fly waves without creating any more
further frizz and I've only recently
started using this hat but it does
really work this Mets hat is again a
slightly strange run and then it's
basically using your highlighter that
you would usually use on your face to
actually use on your hair
I love highlighters so much I wish you
babe my face in the stuff pretty much
every day so why not put it on your hair
so to add a little bit more shine to
your hair users when they take a loose
or pressed powder onto a brush like this
and basically just brush this through
some sections of your hair where the
light would naturally hit it and
although this might not show up on
camera I can see that it definitely is
showing up in person so when you go
outside and the Sun actually hits your
hair your hair should look very good
just the next hair hack is again to
reduce oil in your hair or any grease
that you may have and instead of using
on weird cotton bud hack you can also
use a translucent powder that you
usually incorporate into your everyday
makeup quickly so the one I have here is
the two based at primes and Paula's
loose powder do what you want to do is
just take a brush and just apply this to
your roots and this again should absorb
any excess oil and kind of mattify that
root area so it doesn't look shiny or
greasy then I tag is actually using two
bobby pins that you give your ponytail a
little bit more lift
so you think two bobby pins or hair
grips and pinning them underneath a new
ponytail will just make it flip up a
little bit more and give you that more
bouncy ponytail and the next hair hag is
using baking soda to actually wash your
hair with I'm not going to demonstrate
this because it's quite messy but I do
do this sometimes if I do have a bit of
a residue from all the products I've
been using such as shampoos and
conditioners so baking soda basically
removes all of that residue from all of
the products and not buildup in your
roots
and gives back that cleanness and
freshness and back to your hair and the
last highlight is creating a perfect
messy bun every time yes that's right
you heard it right every single time I
have mastered this little technique
myself back when I first started my
youtube channel basically if you have
long or medium hair and you strong
we're creating a buzz because of that
very long excess of hair you can
actually use it to your advantage so the
trip to the perfect messy bun is to
basically wrap your hair as you usually
would but on the last tie you want to
pull it out about this much I'm looking
very fabulous right now I know so as you
can notice I have this excess bit of
hair here which is so frustrating you
don't know where you want to put it but
but but I have a solution what you want
to do with this hair is actually pull it
through this little loop that we've
created and this is going to act as your
volume volume you but this enough as you
want okay now what you want to do is
close off this bun but loop this excess
bit of hair back through with this bun
once again and now what you want to do
is just close off the bun like slow and
just bobby pin this in place so as you
can see I've got like the perfect sock
bonnet situation going on here without
any extra hair donut or socks or
anything like that just for using the
excess bit of hair you can create this
really nice messy sock bun heads up so
there's all my hair hat video have you
