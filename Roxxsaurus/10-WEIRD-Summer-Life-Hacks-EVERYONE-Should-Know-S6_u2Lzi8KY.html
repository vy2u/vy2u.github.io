channel I hope you guys are all well I'm
so excited to be filming this video
because today is probably one of the
hottest days of summer in the UK I
literally have to have a mini handheld
fan because I am melting as you can tell
from the title today I'm going to be
filming some summer hats to make your
life that little bit easier during the
summer especially when it's hot like
this I have done loads and loads of
other hat videos in the past so I'll
leave them all down below in the
description so you guys can check them
out if you enjoyed this video please be
sure to give it a big thumbs up let's go
you get this video to 20,000 likes that
would be amazing and if my face has
never been on your screen before please
be sure to hit that subscribe button
down below
it's funny and you get to keep up with
all the crazy and cool videos that I do
but without global revelry let's jump
right into the video so I have my book
of hacks right here this is the Bible of
hacks so how number one is a drink hack
this is super simple but I would have
never thought you I've done this to
prevent diluting your hope you can
actually make ice cubes made out of coke
so you just want to pour your Pepsi or
coke or whatever drink you're having
that day into the ice cube tray freeze
them to make ice cubes and then you can
pop them in your drink and have a
refreshing and quartering without it I
wish you all never have to deal with
diluted coke again you know when you get
to the bottom of your drink and there's
like just ice cubes err that's the list
number two is for those of you who have
indoor pets like an indoor cat I have
two indoor cats and they are literally
ninja as soon as I creeks open a window
with super hot outside
they literally run for it and I'll
probably never see them again so if you
want to open your windows and get that
cool refreshing air flowing through your
house but you don't want your pets
escaping then you can make a DIY window
shield so all you're gonna need for this
is some tape I'm using quite strong tape
just because my cats are like wild
animals they will literally break
through so what you want to do is take a
tape so I'm starting sideways I'm taping
the window side to side and then I'm
also taking it from top to bottom to
create a grid-like effect this will mean
that air can flow through your window
but your cats won't fit through the
tight space app at number three is for
cooling down your drink
super quickly so what you want to do is
take some tissue or kitchen roll and
whip this under some cold water you
don't want to wrap this around your
beverage and then pop it in the freezer
I don't know why this works but I guess
wet tissue kind of freezes quicker than
just a regular beverage being put in the
freezer so here you have it a core
refreshing drink in probably less than
10 minutes
hi number four is if you are super hot
in there's literally nowhere you can
cool down and you don't have a fan all
you want to do is take your wrist and
run this under a cold tap for at least
five minutes this is going to cool down
your blood and make you less hot this is
genius right I'm so going to do that
after this video back number five is
using a talcum powder or baby powder to
remove any sand off of your body after
you've been to the beach I'm not too
sure about this I think the way it works
is the talcum powder
basically dries the texture of your skin
which makes it less sticky so the sand
won't stick to it and it'll just
basically really easily flake off hack
number six is kind of a silly one I
don't know if you guys don't believe me
but I definitely vouch for this and I
think it works and it's basically eating
carrots to get tan so carrots along with
other super foods such as sweet potatoes
and tomatoes are very enriched with a
potent antioxidant called carotene
carotene
I don't really know how to pronounce it
we eat multiple servings of this
antioxidant it will kind of naturally
warm up your skin tone from within I
actually think this really works because
when I was younger I would eat carrots
like a bunny I was so so obsessive
carrot and my skin was actually much
darker when I was younger but that is
why I think it works so try it maybe
your work fit - b7 is putting a mirror
into an ice tray so we all know aloe
vera is an amazing
ingredient to treat your son bandwidth
but you can actually freeze it and not
only will this treat your son bun but
it's also going to cool down your skin
and make it feel less irritated imagine
that eight is a traveling hack so if
you're going on holiday and you're
packing your suitcase try putting your
days worth of clothes into a sandwich
bag if you're going for multiple days I
think it's worth doing this because it's
going to separate out all of your
clothes and your underwear for every
single day so you won't get confused on
what you've already worn plus it also
makes your clothes spill proof so if you
happen to have any accidents your
clothes are going to be totally fine I'm
at number eight is turning any regular
cup into a travel slash spill proof cup
all you need for this is regular cling
film and a glass so you want to take a
cling film and basically wraps around
the top of your glass pop your straw
through and you are good to go your
drink is not going anywhere
hype number 10 is lightining your hair
in a natural way so for this you want a
lemon water and a spray bottle so you
want to pop your water into the spray
bottle and add key squad's
of your lemon juice you then want to
spray this lightly throughout your hair
and you're going to go out into the Sun
for a few minutes and let the Sun
reaction with the lemon juice after that
you just want to shampoo and condition
your hair and your hair should gradually
lighten up now I'm going to give you
guys an extra hat just because I just
remembered this and I thought it was so
strange and but I think it would
actually work so if you all go to the
beach and you are worried about leaving
your valuables on your towel get a
diaper like a baby's diaper
what would your valuables inside it and
then wrap up the diaper to make it look
like it's been used and no one will go
near it I think this is such a clever
hack because literally I don't I would
never have thought to go near a used
diaper because that's gross but
hopefully there's no one at the beach
like collecting rubbish because maybe
they will take it so that's the only
downside of that I could think of
otherwise I think this would work really
well so that is all for this week's
video I really hope you guys enjoyed
and I hope that these hats help you out
this summer because I know summer can be
quite difficult to get through
especially when it's hot like this if

those annoying and obnoxious sparse
areas in your brows so strangely enough
using a concealer fixes this problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
