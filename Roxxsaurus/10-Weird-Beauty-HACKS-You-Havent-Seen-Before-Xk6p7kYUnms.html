hope you guys a little well so today I
have strategically cut off the top of my
head because my roots are currently
looking like this
they are so Draco Malfoy I really need
to turn them so let's ignore that today
I'm coming at you with another ET hags
video I'm so excited because I have come
across a lot of new beauty hacks that I
have never actually seen before which
I'm super excited to share with you guys
also I'm feeling like very autumnal
today can you tell by the lip if you
guys have never seen my face before
click that subscribe button down below
and join the dinosaur family and lost
your eye why don't you give this video a
thumbs up I heard you get cookies
if you thumbs up so who doesn't want
cookies but without further ado let's
jump right into the video
so hack number one is rescuing it your
fell tip line I never thought this was
possible because once you have used that
little felted pen and it's all like
crooked and basically just not precise
anymore it's kind of like ah that's
there my felt tip liner is dead but
there's actually a chance that it's
still alive I didn't actually know this
but sometimes applying does have a
double-ended tip so wear your eyeliner
is looking something like this what you
can do is actually take your liner out
turn it around and replace the tip so
you have a brand new and precise end so
I don't know about you guys but I think
that this hack is new to revolutionary
because if you have a dead eye on a
light line you can actually get a few
more uses out of it because more than
likely there's going to be much more
product right on the end of your tip
then when you turn it over you still got
a couple of uses out of your dead
eyeliner hack number two is another
pretty cool one if I say so myself
so the hack is to transform your regular
face brush into a contour brush I might
have daddy this is I really need to
watch this all you want to do is take a
regular hey grip and digitally just
slide this over the bristles like so so
this is going to pinch the brush and
create a really thin kind of shape
like you would have with a contour brush
the let's make you put it to the test
and see if it works any better our oh
yeah I think this definitely works what
do you guys think obviously I need to
blend it up but this is really great for
precision so the next hang is suppose of
us who have long nails and hate applying
lip balm nobody lip balm is like a tiny
container and when you put your finger
in it to apply to your lip it gets all
underneath and out I think it's super
bright it's like one of my biggest pet
peeves
so I've actually come up with a pretty
easy yet effective solution instead of
using your finger you just want to use
your knuckle and I think that's like
really silly to say but it actually
works so the next Hagee is using a
tampon to remove your nail polish so I
don't know why this would be practical
perhaps if you have just done your
fingers and then you want to do your
toes so what you want to do is just
literally soaked up the tampon in some
nail polish remover and then just remove
it with the nail polish remover but it
actually works super great and you don't
have to use a cotton pads the next thing
is defining your collarbone and your
cleavage if you are wearing a low-cut
top so right now as you can see I'm
wearing an off-the-shoulder top which
means my collarbones are exposed there
to make them that little bit more
appealing I don't know why Kohlberg's
would be appealing but you know one plus
a you can actually use a contour palette
so you just literally want to contour
the hollows and the highlights of your
collarbones and your work to your face
just picking up a brown shade and I'm
going to go in to my collarbone and just
start contouring it underneath and on
the top as well and then you can also
pick up the highlight shade and
literally just highlight on top of the
color so this isn't going to make a lot
of difference but it is going to give
that subtle bit of definition it to your
top half when you are wearing a top like
this the next type is for drying your
hair so if you have been using a towel
or your life like me you've actually
been doing it wrong so attention it is
actually much more delicate on the hair
the fibers on as rough and tough but a
t-shirt rather than a towel is much more
hurt when you are drying your hair so
use that next time the next thing is for
those of you who struggle with those
sturdy nail polishes which always seem
to dry shut and you can never undo them
again so what you want to do is when you
actually get a brand new nail polish
just rub some Vaseline on the
circumference of the lid and so just
make sure that no polish will ever try
there which means it will never dry
sharp
nakiya Jen and metallic liquid lipsticks
have been all the rage recently they
have my pricey so if you don't know
whether a metallic color will suit you
you can actually make a do I want to see
if it does so what you want to do is
take some vaseline or clear lip balm and
mix this in with a metallic sparkly
eyeshadow of course it's not going to be
as long-lasting but it's a good way to
just try it out and see if it actually
suits you then alas hag is to combat
those annoying pimples we all go through
it we all struggle with spots we've all
heard of the typical placing a
toothpaste on your pimple to get rid of
it overnight but what if you have a
pimple and you can't wear toothpaste on
your face during the day well you can
actually just use Listerine so you want
to take some of the mouthwash on your
finger and just literally rub it into
the zit and then you can place
foundation over the top obviously it's
not going to show up with your skin so
you don't need to worry about it being
there and being visible the Listerine is
still going to work its magic
underneath so those are all of my beauty
