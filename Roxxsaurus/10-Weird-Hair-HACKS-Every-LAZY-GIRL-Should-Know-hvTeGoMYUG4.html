to my channel a heavy guys are doing
really well there since I've currently
got pink hair I thought I have to take
advantage of this moment and basically
for my hair habit if you guys and I do I
have about two videos ago if you guys
haven't seen that yet I'll leave it down
below as well is a little I and honestly
it was so much fun I am absolutely
loving this color but it was only
semi-permanent which means that it's
slowly starting to fade I really don't
know how I feel about that because I
really am loving this hair color
I really never know whether I should dye
my hair color this permanently because I
am really liking it but I'm not too sure
whether I proposed it or my blonde hair
I'm being you guys to help me make up my
mind tell me down below what you guys
think oh and by the way I am currently
doing a giveaway so if you guys haven't
seen my Primark haul I'm basically
giving away these two Pro Mod giftcard
they're both work 50 pounds and if you
guys want to win one of these all you
have to do is be subscribe and comment
down below use social media and double
up your chances and when the other gift
card all you have to do is follow me on
my Instagram which is rock-solid and
just comment on the picture of these two
were good cards but there's no problem
let's go to the video
the first pack is for when you don't
have any transparent elastic ties all
the ones that match your hair and when
using big bulky hair ties it can kind of
lose the effect that you're going for so
what you can actually do is use the hair
grip to seal off your braid you just
want to pin the hagreb vertically up
into the braid and hide it at the back
the tag is so simple and easy but no
hair ties are required if you're bored
of your straight hair and you don't have
a curling iron you can actually use tin
foil and a hair straightener simply call
your hair around your fingers and roll
it all the way up you don't want to wrap
the tin foil around the car and keep it
as flat as possible and then apply the
heat from your hair strainer onto the
tin foil the tin foil shouldn't get
unbearably hot but since you are dealing
with a power tool make sure you're super
careful anyways and when you unravel the
foil you should be left with a really
bouncy curl the smaller strand of the
hair the more prominent the car will be
contesta yeah yes but I never got a hack
free is super easy and there spraying
dry shampoo into your hair in the
morning do it the night before and that
way the dry shampoo can work its magic
into your route while you toss and turn
in bed you also won't have that white
powder residue in your hair in the
morning
you are welcome
the next tag is for those of you who
struggle with achieving a fishtail braid
I know it can be a nightmare don't worry
I got your girlfriend agree a faux
fishtail braid just take two strands of
hair from the front and from the back
and secure it with an elastic tie in the
middle you then want to take another two
strands and do the same you just want to
repeat the step over and over again
until you get to the bottom of your hair
and you just want to tie it off with a
hair tie once that's done you can pull
apart each strand and push the clear
elastic down to cover them up this is
such an easy way to get same effect as a
fishtail braid but without the are make
me hack fibers for those of you you have
ends so split that they're basically
divorced did you like that joke I'm so
not funny moving on all you want to do
is take three fingers and thread your
hair under over and under again this
will make all the split ends pop up and
which you can then trim off with some
really sharp scissors
if you ever wondered what you would look
like with a fringe or bangs as Americans
call it take your hair and wrap it into
a top knot bun take the remaining ends
of your hair install them over your
forehead with some hair straighteners
this is a really effective way to see if
you would actually suit a fringe or not
without actually having to cut your hair
I found myself sometimes after being in
the sea your hair can get st. a yucky
green color to effectively get rid of
this you just want to add some ketchup
into your hair and wash your hair with
that it feels so wrong but trust me it
does works and thread cancels out the
green tones on the color wheel
Hecate is great if you had sometimes
become stiff from hairspray try spraying
it onto your hand first and then using
it to smooth down any sideways when
washing your hair try using cold water
to rinse off shampoo this closes off the
hair follicle meaning if you have
colored hair you'll keep the color more
vibrant for longer and it also prevents
the hair from breakage and the next hack
is also for preventing your hair from
breaking after washing your hair try
using the coldest heating to dry your
hair with the cold heat closes off the
hair follicle and prevents the strands
from stretching out like they do when
they're exposed to water and heat this
hack will make your hair so much more
stronger and less prone to breakage so
that is all for this video those was my
ten her hat I really hope you guys found
this helpful and beautiful if you guys
are new in this video make sure you
smash that thumbs up just down below and
also subscribe for a chance to win one
of these gift cards I'm so excited to be
given either way but that is all for me
for today I'm really happy guys I have a
wonderful day and I'll see you very soon
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
