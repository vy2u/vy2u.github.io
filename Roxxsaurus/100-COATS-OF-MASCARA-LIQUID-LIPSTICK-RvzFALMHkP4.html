channel I hope you guys are all well
today I have a very very very strange
video I know a lot of you have probably
seen at this type of video all over
YouTube recently this whole kind of hype
was started by this username here on
YouTube and she did like a nail polish
mountain really really strange I
actually really wanted to film this
video a few days ago before it became
like this huge hype though I don't want
you guys to think I'm copying anyone in
particular because I was actually
meaning to do this video for a while now
and I just haven't gotten around to
doing it yet so here I am doing it now
is probably one of the strangest videos
I've ever done on this channel so today
I'm going to be doing a hundred coats of
mascara and a hundred coats of liquid
lipstick if you guys somehow enjoy this
really strange video please give it a
thumbs up let's try and get this video
to 20,000 likes and also if you are
brand new please be sure to click that
subscribe button down below and also
subscribe to my vlog channel at rock
sores blocks and follow me on my social
media we get to be friends and what good
stuff and my twitter is to go and
snapchat our all rocks or the same way
it's out here but without my boo let's
jump right into this crazy video
so this is the 100 coats of mascara I
think this looks ridiculous like my
eyelashes right now a so clumped I feel
like I literally have like one to
breathe like five lashes this is the
before of what my lashes usually look
like and this is the after I know I'm
just going to have so much fun taking
this off now honestly also just so you
know I have already filmed this once but
the file has corrupted so I had to
re-film it and this is the second time I
have put a hundred coats of mascara on
my eyes so basically rest in peace
Roxy's eyelashes I don't know if you can
tell but I was honestly like sweating in
this video because it's so tedious doing
a hundred coats of the same thing over
and over again finally I have finished I
thought I'd never be done honestly I
don't think I'm ever putting lipstick on
again after this so these are the
results I actually don't think that it
looks like I'm wearing a hundred layers
of lipstick my lips just feel really
really numb they don't particularly feel
dry but they feel really not this is a
hundred layers of liquid lipstick so
guys that is all for this video I really
hope you guys found it entertaining
interesting I don't really know what
this video was I wouldn't say this video
was fun I really thought it would have
been fun it really awesome so would not
recommend for you guys to do this at
home and that is why you have me so I
can do all the stupid stuff on the
internet if you guys enjoy this video
please be sure to give it a big thumbs
up I mean I had to do this again so I
put 200 coats of mascara on my eyelashes
in total so I think that deserves a
thumbs up if you have never seen this
face before be sure to subscribe to my
channel just down below I don't know I'm
gonna
like this and also and also follow me on
my social media my Twitter Instagram
snapchat are all rock surahs thing where
it's about here I hope you ever have a
wonderful day and I'll see you very very
soon in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
