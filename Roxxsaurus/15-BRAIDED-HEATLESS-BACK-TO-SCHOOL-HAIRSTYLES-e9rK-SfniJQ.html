channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far
sorry today I am so super excited
because I am back again with another 15a
heatless hairstyles I have done at this
video already last month and it got like
over 2 million views which is absolutely
insane thank you all so much for
watching and supporting that video since
you guys really liked that video I
thought I would come back again and film
another 50 hairstyles for you guys the
hair so in this video are absolutely
perfect for school or work and even prom
which I know prom is coming up for a lot
of you guys so I'm super excited to be
showing needs headphones with you if you
guys enjoyed this video and make sure
you smash their cell surface down below
and also subscribe if you haven't
already because I would love to have you
here come and join the dinosaur family
but that's enough rambling we have 15
hairstyles to get through it so let's
get into the video so for this first
hairstyle what you want to do is take a
chunk of hair from the top of your head
at section this off and start braiding
this into a fishtail braid so create a
fishtail braid you want to separate the
hair into two sections and start taking
it small chunks of hair from each side
and crossing this over on to the other
side every now and again you want to
pull a new section of hair from the
front of your face and add this into the
braid doing this is going to create this
really cool new waterfall effect to your
braids which makes it have really
interesting to look at from the back and
it's very simple to do for the next
hairstyle you want to take a two chunks
of hair from the front of your face
twist them around and tie them at the
back you then want to take another two
strands and do the same and just tie
everything together in the middle next
what you want to do is take two six
strands of hair just underneath and tie
this in the middle and sort of pull it
out just like this I'm then going to do
this again and repeat the same step and
I'm going to braid the rest of the
strand into a Dutch braid this house
thought is super simple to do but it
looks like you've put so much effort
into it for the next hair so what you
want to do is braid it one side of your
head
and twist this and the middle section of
the back of your head into a bun once
I've done you want to take the other
side of your hair and braid this again
and just wrap that braid around the bun
I realized this is quite difficult to
explain but I'm hoping you guys
understand what I mean this hassle it's
so pretty and I think this would be
perfect for proms well the next
hairstyle you want to take a chunk of
your hair from the top and tie this up
into a high ponytail instead of pulling
out all of your ponytail through you
want to leave this sort of looped
looking shape which you're then gonna
split into two and take the remaining
hair and loop this over the front
creating this bow shape to keep it in
place all day long you just might secure
it with a few hair grips and you'll be
good to go
this next hairstyle is a little bit more
difficult because we're going to be
creating a braid with four strands so
the first thing you want to do is
section your hair into four strands and
take the first left strand and put this
underneath the second strand over the
third strand and then underneath the
fourth strand so think of this as like a
weaving effect all you want to do is
just take it under over and under every
single time you just want to repeat this
step over and over again until you get
to the end of your hair once you get a
hang of this this will be so much easier
and to trust me if so worth it because
look how beautiful it looks
the next hairstyle is a braided top knot
bun so you want to flip your head over
and just gather your hair into a high
ponytail while forming your top knot bun
you want to take out two strands which
you're going to leave a full time being
once your hair is now secured into a bun
you want to take the two strands and
start braiding them once the braids are
secured you want to just wrap them
around the bun it this is going to give
it a nice and little stuff of detail I
think this is a really cute way to just
spice up a regular topknot bun well this
next hair so what you want to do is
section your hair into three sections so
a top section a middle section and then
a bottom section onto all of your hair
is parted you want to just braid every
single strand and wrap them into a bun
but we're going to create a really cute
triple bun at the back of your head
which i think is really really cute and
dainty it's quite an unusual hairstyle
but I think it's super cute
for this next Pascal what you want to do
is take a chunk of hair from each side
of your head and start braiding this
into a regular braid like so once your
braids are finished you want to take
them towards the back of your head and
just kind of overlap them and have one
on top and one underneath
once your braids are secured either I
want to take two strands of hair from
each side twist them and then also pin
them underneath the braid and voila this
is a hairstyle finish well the snakes
hair so I'm taking a chunk of hair from
the front of my face and I'm starting to
braid this into a Dutch braid I'm taking
this to the back and kind of halfway
down my head I have stopped adding extra
strands of hair to the braid and just
braiding the remaining parts of my hair
then I want to do the same thing to the
other side and just pull your braids
apart and this is the hair self finished
this is kind of like an updo flush down
do so you kind of get the best of both
worlds for the next hair so you want a
section of a two part of your hair and
tie them together at the back you then
want to loop to a pony tail through the
little hole in the middle or twice and
then sectioning off the rest of my hair
into two parts and just breathing both
sides with a regular braid once your
braids are done you want to pin them in
place like so I don't really know how to
explain this very well but I hope you
guys can see what I'm doing I think this
creates a really nice at woven effect to
your hair it also looks like you've put
so much effort into it when all you've
done is just pinned two braids to the
back of your head
the next hairstyle is just a regular
fishtail braid that's braided all the
way down to the lengths of your hair
once you have done that you can
basically take the braid and just wrap
this and tuck this inside underneath
your hair if you want to see how to do a
Dutch braid
I'll leave another video down below
where I explain this a little bit
further but this is the finished
hairstyle I think it's super cute for
this next hairstyle I'm taking two
chunks of my hair from each side of the
face and braiding those once that's done
I'm taking those two braids to the back
of my hair and tying this together which
I'm then forming into a little a braided
bun once this is secured you can take a
chunk of hair just directly underneath
the bun and start braiding this into a
reverse fishtail braid I reverse
fishtail braid is just like a regular
fishtail braid however instead of
putting the sections of the hair over
the braid you want to put them
underneath which will create a reverse
fishtail braid this next hairstyle is
another topknot bun hairstyle so you
want to start off with a high
which I'll leave out a section of hair
and just form a regular bun and you
usually word what the section of hair
that we've left out you just want to
form this into a fishtail braid pull
this apart and wrap this around your bun
doing this is just going to spice up
your regular topknot bun and make it
look so much more edgy for the next
hairstyle we're going to flip our head
over and start taking it to chunks of
hair from each side and just basically
tying this with a clear elastic tie in
the middle you want to do this about
three or four times and this will create
this really cool effect and design at
the back of your head if you put it up
into a bun this next hairstyle is a
really cool line at what you want to do
is just take two chunks of hair and
braid them again as usually would but
instead of tying them together at the
back you want to start braiding them
together as you can see I'm doing here
this will take a little bit of time to
get the hang of once you've done that
you want to take another strand of hair
just above the ones you've taken at
previously and start braiding this as
you did with the other one you then want
to do the same thing on the other side
and again start braiding those braids
together just like you did the first
time this is going to create a really
cool crossover design at the back of
your head I think this is such a cool
hairstyle it's really unique and I
absolutely love it those are my 15
heatless hairstyles I absolutely love
all of them and I pretty much want to
wear them every single day so that's so
easy to do on yourself I'm actually
quite interested to know which one of
