hi today I'm going to be filming another
15 beauty hacks and I made a 20 beauty
hacks video so if you want to see that
too that will be in the description
below so I'm making this upper video
because you guys seem to like my last
one and some of these hats you guys may
already know it but I would like to
share them all those of you who don't
know them yet so I hope you guys have
fun these hats helpful and let me know
what you think about that and if you use
any of these hats or have your own hats
you'd like me to know about then
definitely let me know down below so
without further ado let's just jump
right in so the first beauty hack is to
get lovely smelling hair and basically
what you have to do is take your hair
brush I've got mine here and then you
take a perfume of choice so you just
spritz that on your hair brush and then
you can brush your hair through with
this and what that's going to do is just
brush through that lovely scent and
you're going to get a very subtle sort
of smell to your hair
in my last hack video some of you were
wondering how to make water line liners
stay in place because it tends to wear
off quite quickly so my hack to you is
to apply your water line liner as usual
and then to lock the whole thing in
place what you have to do is pick up
some white eyeshadow and just really
lightly Pat that over your waterline and
that's just really gonna set your liner
in place all day long if your eyeshadows
are looking at a little bit enough and
you would like them to be more pigmented
all you have to do is dip your brush
into a little bit of water I mean don't
go crazy don't like dip it in the water
so it's absolutely soaked but just
dampen it a little bit and then go ahead
and Pat your brush into your eyeshadow
and apply it as usual and you'll see
that the shadow comes out much more
pigmented and darker if you're trying to
create a smoky eyeliner look for you
only own a regular coral eyeliner you
can actually transform it into a gel
liner just a quick thing if you guys are
underage then definitely get an adult or
guardian to help you because it can be
dangerous so I have my trusty little
lighter here and basically what you have
to do is hold the pencil over the
lighter
so it melts and you wait for a few
seconds so that you don't burn yourself
make sure it's cool enough before you
put this anywhere near your face and
then you've got this really smoky and
smudgy eyeliner that you can work with
and blend really easily then this one is
quite popular ones so some of you might
already know this one but you can
actually use a mascara to apply your
eyeliner with a little brush so what I'm
doing is I'm just taking one mascara
wand and I'm just picking up some of
that product using my brush and then we
can just go ahead and use this as a
regular eyeliner
of course if you're using mascara to
apply your eyeliner you might need a
little bit more layers of it to build up
the darkness of your eyeliner this next
hack is a great one for underlining the
color of your eyes and bringing out the
richness of the color in them
I think this hack should work for people
of all colors hopefully but let me know
if it works on you basically what I'm
doing is I'm taking a shadow that's
closest to my eye color and I'm just
popping that in the very center of my
waterline where my eye is when I look
forward and what this is going to do is
just really brighten up the color of
your eye and liven it up and really
bring out the richness of the color in
your eyes this next hack is a great way
to cover up any pimple any spots
effectively and we need for this is a
green toned concealer so I don't
actually have any spots at the moment my
skin is being pretty good recently so
I'm just gonna create one with there
some red lip pencil I'll know would you
look at that so I'm just going to take
that on the little precision brush and
dump that over the spot because the
green is on the opposite side too the
color red on the color chart this is
just going to really nicely consular
that redness in your spot so as you can
see that's covered it pretty well you
don't see any redness seeping through or
anything and now to make this look more
natural you can always play some skin
toned concealer or foundation to just
cover up this bad boy see it's like the
pin port was never even that the next
hack is that when you run out of shaving
gel in the bath or in your shower then
what you can use instead is that one of
your hair conditioners of course don't
use like a really expensive hair
conditioner just use one that's quite
cheap and you don't mind it going down
the drain and I find that using a hair
conditioner to shave with is actually
better than shaving gels I don't know it
sort of softens the hairs a little bit
as well I feel like so it just makes it
really easy to get a clean shave for
your legs and yeah
this next hack is creating a perfect
winged liner by using a spoon that's
right you heard me just a spoon then
what you want to do is take the handle
of the spoon and trace a line along that
and then flip over the spoon and use the
cut side to fill in the top and when you
take away the spoon you should be left
with a pretty good guideline and you
just fill in some gaps and make
adjustments and there you go
to achieve really nice heatless waves
overnight all you're going to do is even
and take your heads on one side and just
start reading it in a regular braid you
can even do two braids and that's going
to create a much more defined sort of
way to your hair but doing this one it's
just going to give that soft beachy sort
of wave to it so you can leave this
braids in overnight and what this is
going to do is just create that soft
wave whilst you're sleeping and it's
also quite good to sleep with your hair
in a braid because it just stops so your
hair from breaking and getting ready
tangled and messy while you sleep if
your favorite mascara is getting sort of
clumpy and dried up what you should do
before applying it is just roll it
around in your hands like this and
that's just going to warm up the product
on the inside and this is going to stop
your mascara from clumping so much
because the products inside will be
warmed up as opposed to being really
solid if you're like me and you never
cover your head just because it takes
you so long to do it this is a really
cool trick for you so what I'm doing is
I'm just taking a scrunchie and then I'm
flipping my head over and I'm putting
that up in a ponytail and now rather
than curling every single section of
your hair separately you can just take
chunks of your ponytail and curl it that
way
and then once you let your ponytail out
you've got these really nice curls at
the bottom here for this next hack what
we're going to need is some PVA glue a
base coat and a glittery nail polish so
what we're going to do first is we're
going to apply the base coat just so
that our now is undamaged when we put on
the glue on top so I'm just taking the
same little nail polish and brush from
my base coat and I'm dipping that in the
PVA glue and then running that all over
my nail once that's dry we can go in
with the glittery nail polish and put a
few layers of that onto our now by the
way guys excuse the stain now I was
wearing black nail polish before this
and I didn't wear a base coat so it kind
of stained it a little bit and as you
can see it's really simple all you need
is basically one swipe with a nail
polish remover and all of the glitter
will come off in one layer the broken
eyes shadow trick and yes I did
completely ruin this perfectly fine eye
shadow for the sake of this video so now
we're gonna be just ruining it that
little bit more
ah this is really quite satisfying in a
way alright so basically once you have a
broken eye shadow and you want to fix it
you just want to break it completely
into dust then you can take a little
cotton bud like this and just press that
over and press everything into place and
the magical step to fix this eyeshadow
is to add some surgical spirits some of
you may know this as rubbing alcohol
this little bottle is like kid proof and
I can't open it I'm not even a kid ah
yes so what you want to do is just pop a
few drops of this in to the eyeshadow
and just let it sink in there I'm gonna
really press that in there and then you
are you fixed your shadow and now you
have to just wait for it to dry and it
will be good as new
he's making an appearance and another
hat for you by the way I was just to
clear up some confusion I didn't name
him Lucifer after Satan I named him
after the cat from Cinderella so I don't
know why everyone is getting so worked
up about it I'm not even religious so I
don't believe in Satan but to be fair he
is a little devil he's such a Norton
Yorker and this last hack is an easy way
to achieve a gradient ombre lip and what
you need for this is a white eyeshadow
preferably a matte one and you're just
going to dab that in the center of your
lip top and bottom Pat your lips
together and there you are
a really easy gradient lip and this will
work on practically any lipstick you
like and that is all for this video I
