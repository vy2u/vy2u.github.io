beauty hacks for you guys and I'm super
excited to be filming another one of
these videos because I know you guys
really like these videos so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you do
then definitely leave me a thumbs up can
we get this video to 10,000 likes and
also subscribe for more videos I upload
it twice a week so definitely hit that
subscribe button for new videos every
week so hack number one is actually an
eyebrow hack we all know I are important
and sometimes you get those really
sparse areas that you can't fill and no
product seems to cling onto the skin so
when no product seems to cling onto the
eyebrow what you want to do is take some
cream concealer and four small brush
just Pat it over your sparse area of
your brow after that you just want to go
with your eyebrow powder over your
eyebrow as usual and the concealer will
just make sure that the brow product
really clings onto the skin of your
eyebrow and it's just going to fill that
sparse area in your brow really well
back number two is for your eye makeup
if you have are struggling to create the
perfect edge for your cut crease you can
actually take a spoon place the edge of
the spoon into your crease and just
blend your eye shadow into that as
usually word and then once you're done
with blending you can take away the
spoon and you are left with a really
clean edge that you don't have to clean
up with any makeup remover or concealer
at all hack number three if you ever
want to put your hair up or you don't
have a hair tie around gonna have to
take a makeup brush or a pen or anything
thin along so what you want to do is you
want to put your hair up into a high
ponytail and then wrap it around as you
would into a high bun and then what you
want to do is just take your thin object
and just paste that directly through the
bun and this is just going to hold your
bun in place and you don't have to worry
about your hair being in your face have
them before is making your regular
eyeshadow into a cream shadow all you
want to do is take some of your regular
eyeshadow that you want to make into a
cream shadow and just add a little bit
of water if you want the product to last
much more I would recommend to use a
setting spray instead of water it will
just make sure that the product isn't
breaking down as much and it will just
slide on a much more smoother hack
number five is to apply your bottom lash
mascara with a fan brush instead of the
brush
comes with the mascara this just gives
you a little bit more precision and make
sure that there's no clumps on your
bottom lashes and also makes sure that
you don't get any of the product on your
skin Act number six is to cut up your
lashes into thirds before you apply them
onto your eyes this hat just makes your
life so much easier and I find this
really helpful as well because I
actually find a plain lashes super hard
so having three shorter sections to
apply on to your eye it just makes the
whole job much easier than applying the
whole band of lashes the next hack is
great for travel if you ever find
yourself without any makeup brushes on
you can actually create a really nice
smoky eye by just using a regular q-tip
so what you want to do is you want to
pull out the end of the q-tip to the
cotton just makes a really nice fluffy
end and you can actually use this to
blend out your shadow exactly as you
would with a makeup brush if you ever
find your lashes on your bottom lash
line looking a little bit sparse you can
actually fix this by just taking some
plain black eyeline and just creating
little tiny dots with this at the very
root of your lash and what this does is
just makes your lash line
look that tiny little bit more fuller
the next hack involves a toothbrush and
your hair I know is a weird combination
but basically what can actually do is
back comb your hair with a toothbrush it
sounds really strange but you can
actually get a lot precision with a
two-photon without a combing brush next
like it is for nail polish removal
removing my nail polish is probably one
of my least favorite things and a really
good way to remove your nail polish
without actually wasting any of the
products to cannot be regular cleaning
sponges and place them into a jar next
you just want to pour some nail polish
remover in then if you shake it about
the nail polish remover will actually be
absorbed throughout the sponges and then
when you place your finger in you can
just kind of wiggle it about and it's
just going to remove your nail polish
really well with a using tons and tons
of nail polish and cotton buds if you
don't have a hair crimper but you and
your hair to have that subtle wave to it
you can actually take your hair just
braid into regular braids and then run
your hair straighteners over the braid
and once you release the braid is going
to leave your hair with a really nice
wave to it this next hack is kind of
weird but I find it really interesting
and I think it would be useful the
people who are in a rush in the mornings
so what you can do is actually make your
own DIY eyeshadow tattoos you know those
things that you can actually buy and
place it on your eye peel off and then
you are left with a really nice eye
makeup basically you can actually make
one yourself all you need is some crafts
foam and eyeshadows of choice so you
want to cut out the foam core
to your eye shape and size so then you
just go ahead and take your eyeshadows
of choice and literally pack that
product onto the phone once they're done
you can store them away put them to one
side and in the mornings you can
actually wake up and press these onto
your eyelids and while I you are left
with the product on your eyelid exactly
where you want it and then what you can
do is just touch it up and blend it out
with a fluffy brush and you are done the
next hack is a really cool way to create
really easy nail art all you need is a
sponge and two nail polishes of choice
so what you want to do first is take
your two nail polishes of choice and
just pop them onto the foil next you
have to take a toothpick or something to
mix the two polishes with and stop
mixing the two colors together to kind
of create a barrier of gradient where
the two nail polishes kind of fade into
each other then you want to take your
bit of sponge and just dab that directly
onto the nail polishes and then it
directly onto your nail and once you
take away the sponge you are left with
this really cool gradient design on your
nails the next tag is that using a spoon
to actually contour your cheek what you
want to do is take your spoon and kind
of place it over your cheek directly
where you want your contour to be and
then blend your product in as usually
would and once you take away your spoon
you are left with a really nice sharp
guideline as to where you should blend
your product in next the last tag is one
I've seen a lot all over the internet
and I really wanted to try it myself and
that is to actually use red lipstick
underneath your eyes to color correct
your dark circles and I know that
there's a lot of products out there that
actually do that for you but if you just
want to try it out as like a one-time
thing I think that this is a really
weird but cool way to color correct your
eyes so what you need is a red matte
lipstick that's quite creamy you want to
dab that underneath your eyes and then
just blend it out and I've done that you
can pop your foundation over the top and
you can see that and this supposedly
conceals your dark circles better than a
foundation and concealer would on its
own so that is all for my beauty hacks I
