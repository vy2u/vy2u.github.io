channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so I'll say today and you
can see in the title I'm going to be
doing another hairstyle video I love
doing tests on video see vibe so today
i've got 15 heatless hairstyles that
incorporate some braids and some updos
and down doozie going to be amazing for
back-to-school and also to work or just
any occasion in general because our all
slow its so pretty much I'm not going to
take like hours and hours to do that if
you guys are in a rush but you still
want to look like put together like you
put loads of effort into your hair then
this video is perfect for you if you
guys enjoy watching hair tutorials on
this channel refuse my shaky thumbs up
just down below try another video to
40,000 lines I'll be literally amazing
and if you are new don't get subscribed
the botanist is down below
come and join at the dinosaur family I'm
going to stop rambling now there's a lot
of hairstyles no time to wait so let's
get into the video so for the times past
are what you want to do is take a chunk
of hair from the front of your face and
start braiding that into a reverse braid
you want to then repeat the same thing
for the other side and pull the braid
apart to make them more volume eyes and
then going to take those two braids to
the back of my head and tie them
together with a clear elastic tie I'm
then going to take a strand of hair just
from the front of my face underneath the
braid and I'm going to tuck this under
the braid and then loop it through the
little hole as you can see here I'm now
going to repeat the same thing to the
other side so I'm just popping the
strand of hair underneath the braid and
then looping it through over the top I'm
then going to take the two strands of
hair and tie them together with the
commit elastic tie and this creates this
really nice heart shape at the back of
the head in this next hairstyle I'm
going to take a strand of hair at the
back of my head in the center and break
this all the way down and then going to
do the same to the strands on the right
side of my head as well as the left side
of my head once I've got a three braids
at the back I'm just going to 12 them
into a little brave this is going to
make them look like tiny little rows
at the back of my head this hairstyle is
so so easy to do but it's really
effective and looks really pretty and
like you've put loads and loads of
effort into it for this next hairstyle
I'm just taking a strand of hair from
each side of my head and tying this at
the back I'm now going to turn this into
a mini bun it just at the back of my
head and then taking a strand of hair
just on the right hand side and I'm
going to bring this into a Dutch braid
all the way down and kind of pull apart
the strength of the hair to make it a
little bit more fanned out and this is
the hair style finish it's so effortless
but it looks really cute this next
hairstyle is kind of like a mohawk
source of hairstyles so what you want to
do is take a chunk of hair and pop this
into a top bun and then taking two
strands of hair from each side of my
face and tying this at the back and also
creating this into a bun and lastly I'm
creating one more bun towards the back
of my head and this is the hair so
finish is quite funky it's quite unusual
but it's really really cool and easy to
do so the next hairstyle I'm again
taking two strands of hair from the
front of my face and then taking those
braids to the back of my hair and kind
of twisting them around each other and
pinning them into place
twisting the braids together is going to
give it that really nice Greek inspired
effect but it's a little bit different
than the typical hairstyle because the
breaks are twisted together so the next
hairstyle I'm taking a chunk of hair
kind of leaving a strands of hersa was
the front and I'm braiding that into a
regular braid and fanning this up again
and then taking the rest of my hair and
popping this into a high ponytail and
just kind of wrapping the braid and the
chunk of hair around the ponytail this
is really easy to do but it's a really
nice way to spice up a regular ponytail
this next hairstyle is a really easy way
to recreate a fishtail braid effect
without actually having to learn how to
do it so what you want to do is take two
strands of hair from each side of the
ponytail and just tie them off with a
clear elastic tie in the middle you just
want to keep doing that step over and
over again until you get to the bottom
of your hair and that is the finished
look it looks exactly like a fishtail
braid the next hairstyle involves you
braiding the front section of your hair
and incorporating strands from the top
and bottom like you see I'm doing here
I'm braiding this all the way to the
back of my head I'm also taking a thin @
chunk of hair and braiding this and just
wrapping this around the ponytail to
conceal the hair tie and this is the
finished look it's super bohemian and
really quick to do the no test on may be
a little bit tricky but I'm going to
show you guys how to create a four D
braid so what you want to do is split
your hair into two sections and take a
chunk of hair from the right hand side
and pop this onto the left you then want
to take another strand of hair from the
right hand side and pop this underneath
onto the other side you then want to
repeat the same step on the other side
so take a chunk of hair slip it over
onto the other side and then take
another strand of hair from the same
side and flip it under this time it
looks kind of tricky but once you get
the technique down it will become so
much easier it's literally the same
steps over and over again so as you can
see I'm just taking the strand of hair
and popping this over onto the other
side then taking another strand of hair
from the same side and popping this
underneath just keep doing that over and
over again and you have your 4 D braid
all the nice Pascal I'm taking a chunk
of hair from the front of my face once
again and I'm breathing this into a
Dutch braid I'm adding strands from each
side as you can see so that the braid
sits flat against the scalp and I'm just
doing that all the way to the back of my
hair once I finish that and is going to
tie it off and repeat the same thing it
to the other side once my braids are
finished I'm just going to twirl the
rest of the hair into two little buns
and this is a really nice way to spice
up the regular space fun a trendy look
whilst adding a bit of breathing in
there - for the next hairstyle what you
want to do is take a strand of hair from
underneath just by your neck and start
braiding this into a regular braid you
don't want to pull it apart to make it a
little bit more volumizing fluffy and
repeat the same thing to the other side
once that's done you want to flip the
braid over and almost make it act as a
headband and clip it into place
the two braids should meet at the top
and you can then conceal where the
braids start by taking two chunks of
hair and pinning this towards the back
of your head
the next hairstyle is a really nice way
to get your hair out of your face while
still having your hair down so what you
want to do is take two strands of hair
and tie this off at the back you then
want to repeat this step around five
times and that is literally the hair
cell finish it's so is so easy as you
transform this hairstyle you can
actually break the rest of the hair into
a fishtail braid so I'm just putting it
into two sections and taking strands
from each side and just adding it to the
other side as you can see here you want
to repeat this step all the way into the
bottom of your hair and tie this off
with a clear elastic tie for the next
hairstyle and once again taking two
strands of hair from the front of my
face and tying this at the back you
don't want to twirl your hair and do
this step again and then you can braid
the rest of the hair into a fishtail
braid this hairstyle is a super simple
to do and this has all kind of looks
like a hair saw from Game of Thrones
g'bye fear I definitely do
and for the last hairstyle what you want
to do is flip your hair over and
basically separate your hair into two
sections into a middle part and start
braiding your hair from the bottom up
this looks really tricky and trust me it
kind of is especially if you don't have
a mirror so it's going to take a few
tries for you to get this right but once
you do is going to look so so cool mine
is in passage and I'm sure you guys are
going to do it so much better but it's
such a cool hairstyle so those are all
of my 15 heatless hairstyle it really
