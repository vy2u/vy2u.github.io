buckle and again oops
get my back back back but you can't just
get sandal brunch today we are film
independent life every doghouse yes and
I thought these are so relatable I hate
liars but meanwhile I smell of these not
gonna lie you guys enjoyed this video
make sure you make you turns up and also
subscribe if you are brand new bars now
from you
let's get into the video so the first
way is one that every girl seems to tell
herself and it's the fact that when your
boyfriend seems to like everyone's
Instagram photos like all these pretty
girls online but never seems to like
your pictures and you tell yourself that
you don't mind it but it doesn't mean
anything you know you're nothing's going
on between them no of course not but it
turns out you'd like dance no no no
remember it's like why do I do emotional
Instagram Oh what comic made sorry for
Talia
yeah alright
yes doesn't bother me that life is a
classic I do this all the time and
always running late everything's I feel
like saying all I'm only five minutes
away is the best
hello oh yeah no no I'm on my way down
yeah yeah okay I'll see you soon bye
business one I know we both die I've
done that I'm really sorry guys this Y
is the story I haven't seen your text
it's just come through and I haven't had
any signal gives enough to me I've done
that too you know I was doing - I just
saw you two hours later later hello oh
hi how are you no no I didn't get any
peg no I have really bad signal sorry
and I fight is when you're in a rush and
someone texts you how are you going to
be you're like I'm almost ready
no you ain't come are we alive yes a
minute Philippine later
you're a busy person I feel like you can
relate to their annexes when you say to
somebody
oh you know I took my time down and I
let me know asap here corner yeah
realities and why I am at Highland I've
just got my left foot left foot my diary
out and start August
I chose when I was written I live
actually it is possible to again again
again see you later okay okay so the
next slide I've definitely told a few
times and it's actually really
frustrating when someone asks you are
you on your period when you get mad and
you're like no so really my own what
what thing ever I say what your boy
what'd you miss never seen an animal and
they're watching it on a pier a ten year
and she is you're not off limits and
really I'm talking to you why can you
get off oh no I'm not my birria
the next one is hashtags I woke up like
this
and solar this is so like all the air
it's really are you didn't wake up like
that to be feel like I've taken up I've
taken pictures and I make all types of
metal to work on when it isn't but is
possibly the best I've ever looked one
somewhere but I haven't I haven't got a
spotter cover my face I'm a time but I
know there are guys out there that
definitely need will be nice and subtle
so it's like my turn to really say this
one because I'm single this year Roxy
isn't but girls you know me the single
wrinkles Valentine's Day isn't a big
deal
we get this lighting it using all your
buttock is a big deal for everyone it's
okay he got me
oh yeah I like what even the big deal
about Valentine's Day it's so overrated
I love being single
and last is when you tell your boyfriend
to go have a boys night out and you're
like no it's fine you guys have a boys
night they'll be fine
you don't actually enjoy a lady's house
right unlike your mat we'll be going out
with friends and to digest god yeah
are you a goon a loser you don't know me
hello Margo I know of mythical know
people yeah and I go down to a pub blood
all right oh yeah I mean yes that's
frightening
I thought most doing like oh my god I
love it
