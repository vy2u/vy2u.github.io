doing a back-to-school hack video and
this video is so so exciting because I'm
doing a back-to-school giveaway at the
end of it so make sure you stay to the
end if you want to win some cool
supplies and some really good makeup the
information is at the end of the video
and I'm also giving away a MacBook Pro
Santa Sora's is back at it again if you
guys would like a chance to win the
MacBook Pro the main rule is to be
subscribed to this channel as well as my
blog Channel and the rest of the rules
are down in the description below so
make sure you check that out all the
information you need to know is down
that if you guys enjoy this video please
be sure to give a huge thumbs up for me
it helps me out so so much let's try and
get this video to 30,000 likes that
would be amazing but without further ado
let's just jump right into the video ok
so back to school hack number one is
basically if you have written a whole
essay and you can't move over to proof
check it or you can actually do this
copy and paste it into Google Translate
click the listen button I just hear your
answer being read to you out loud and if
there's any mistakes you'll be able to
spot it that way if you are looking for
a free slideshow or elektra what you can
do is type into Google the subject that
you are trying to study and then up that
you want to type out type colon PBT and
that Duty's reviewing will search to all
the different slideshows and lectures
that other lecturers have basically
posted on google and that way you can
really easily study your subject
Oh
ladies me I'm trying to talk have number
three is for those of us who really want
to go on YouTube or social media at
school but they for some reason thought
it was a good idea to block those off
their Wi-Fi oh don't worry I've got you
what you can do is use a proxy and
basically access any website that is
blocked on your school network just like
that hack number four is watching
documentaries to learn your subject I
know how hard it is to concentrate
especially if your subject it's super
super boring and you don't enjoy it but
watching a documentary on the subject is
going to make it much more easy to
digest and it's going to make it just
that little bit more fun hack number
five is for when you are researching for
topics online it's actually so much
easier to use Google Scholar rather than
the original Google because Google
Scholar basically only includes facts
that are beneficial to students rather
than just having absolutely everything
like random websites and blogs that
aren't even related to what you're
studying the next hack is taking a photo
of your planner for the week and
basically setting that as your wallpaper
that way you don't have to keep checking
inside your planner and taking that out
of your backpack all you have to do is
just look at the wallpaper or lock
screen of your phone
this makes it's super quick and simple
the next hike is for studying and it's
actually to make you notes pretty and I
know that sounds really like well duh I
know that I myself I am more likely to
learn from my notes if they look pretty
and organized rather than just having
scruffy notes all written in the same
pen color so yeah make sure your notes
are pretty and organized and that way
you're going to find it much more easier
to learn from your notes next hack is
for those of you who are meant to read a
book over the summer but you never got
around to it so a good hack is to of
course start reading the blood of your
book so that's at the back and it's like
the brief description but you can also
find out information online and have a
more in-depth summary of the plot wine
and the characters and things like that
so I actually did that for my a level
exam I know it's super super bad I
shouldn't have done it but I still want
a in my exam so I'm not complaining
I mean don't take this as like foolproof
because I'm sure it's not going to work
for everyone but it's a good lifesaver
if you are desperate and you have like a
whole novel to read in a day but you are
delivering a speech in front of your
class make sure that your notes are
written in a different color
every few lines unless
going to make it much easier to keep
track of where you are so you don't lose
your spot and it's just going to make
life much more stress-free because we
all know that delivering a presentation
in front of a class is kind of scary if
you find it kind of hard to keep track
of time when you are getting ready in
the morning try making a playlist of a
few song and by the end of the playlist
when you are at the last song you will
know that you really need to rush to get
ready in time it's actually proven that
the color yellow increases focus because
somehow it reduces the production of
melatonin which is a chemical that makes
you sleepy so yeah introduce some yellow
in your life and your focus should
increase if you find it super hard to
get out of bed in the morning like
myself then what you can do is set your
alarm and actually place your phone on
the other side of your room that way you
actually have to get up to turn it off
and you won't oversleep if you're
finding it a little bit difficult
actually focus on your lecture what you
can do is record the whole lecture and
your teacher speaking onto your phone
and that way you have the whole lesson
recorded and you can play it back when
you need it
my next type is for those of you who
have a photographic memory so I don't
know if you guys know but bullet
journals have been all the rage recently
my hike is to actually write down your
notes and then draw like a little
picture or a little diagram next to your
notes and that way it can kind of jog
your memory and if you're not good at
art that's totally fine because you are
more likely to remember yourself drawing
that really bad picture when x height is
for those of you who are always running
late in the morning like myself I'm
super into this what you should do is
pick your outfit for school the day
before so that way when you are rushing
in the morning then you know that your
outfit is already set there for you and
you just have to pick it up and throw it
on and you're good to go
my next tag is writing your notes in a
different Bowl so all the really
important information make them in a
really standout font and that's why they
make you remember the information much
more if you have like a mum ever a spot
before you go to school the next day
what you can do is actually take your
regular toothpaste and just pop that
over your spot and the mint in the
toothpaste is actually going to dry it
up and reduce the redness and like the
swelling of the spot and in the morning
it should be much smaller and reduced
and it should be easier to cover up if
you don't have a deodorant on you or if
you have run out you can actually use
hand sanitizer make it all bits smell a
little bit better the hand sanitizer is
going to get rid of the bacteria which
is actually what produces the odor so if
you use a hand sanitizer it's going to
get rid of the bad smell and make you
feel much more refreshed and the last
hug is if you are bored at school at
break or lunch and literally every
single cool website has been blocked off
of your school network well what you can
do is visit the website pull mathri org
and because it has the word mass in it
your school would have likely not have
blocked it but in reality the website
has nothing to do with mass is actually
a flash game website so there's all my
back-to-school hacks and I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video and find it
helpful if you do please make sure you
give it here comes up and subscribe and
now the moment you have all been waiting
