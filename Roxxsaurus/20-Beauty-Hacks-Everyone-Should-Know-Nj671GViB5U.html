slightly different video than I usually
do and today as you can tell from the
title I'm going to be filming like a
beauty life hack sort of video so
hopefully this video will be helpful to
some of you and maybe you'll get some
inspiration for little tricks and tips
on anything to do with beauty
so about further ado let's just jump
right in so tip number one when you over
line the lips try to only over line the
center part of your lip and for the
outer corners just trace the lipliner
along the natural line of your lips and
now just make sure that your lips look
much more natural when you try to make
them look a little bit bigger by
overlining them also try to recreate the
same shape of your lip and that will
just help it look much more natural as
well to mattify any lipstick all you
have to do is take a face powder and
this can be a pressed powder or a
translucent powder you can load that up
on a fluffy brush and just Pat that on
the lip and this will just absorb any
sort of moisture or shine from the
lipstick and mattify any lipstick you
may have instantly to get rid of knots
in your hair all you have to do is grab
hold of all of your hair and brush from
the bottom this will just ensure that
all your knots are softly brushed out
without tearing your hair out of your
scalp and once your ends are all brushed
through you can move up and brush the
next section and then you can brush the
rest of your hair pain-free if you have
split ends but you don't want to
completely chop off your hair all you
have to do is twist your hair all the
split ends are just gonna pop out of
this twist and all you have to do is
just trim along this is especially good
if you have layers and all the split
ends are on the higher layers of your
hair if you're one of those people who
always struggles with winged eyeliner
masking tape or solar tape will become
your best friend all your going to need
is a strip of masking tape I prefer to
use masking tape because it's less
sticky and as you can see
I'm doing here is I'm just sticking it
to the back of my hand to lose the
stickiness of it and then I'm just
sticking that at the bottom of my eye to
imitate the angle of the eyeliner then
all you need is an eyeliner of choice
and you just draw your eyeliner as you
usually would and this will just ensure
that your liner has a nice clean and
sharp edge at the bottom and you don't
have to worry about it being wonky if
you want to intensify you I make a bit
you don't have any eye primer all you
have to do is take some regular can see
that and just pop that over your eyelid
this will just make sure that the eye
shadow sticks much better to your skin
if you ever find yourself creating a
beautiful hairstyle that's taking you
forever
but only lasts about five seconds you
may be using your hair grip some wrongs
I don't know if you can see that very
well but it's got a flat side and it's
also got a grippy side and most of the
time people take the grip and use this
flat side along the Scout so when you
pin it you pin it like this sort of
thing and have this grippy side on the
front both actual facts what you to do
is take the grippy side and have that to
the bottom of your scalp and the grippy
bit is just going to keep your hair in
place and make sure it doesn't slide out
of your hand
another cool trick I have with hair
grips is that when you're creating a
hairstyle that you want to last for a
long time what you should do is take two
grips and just cross them over like this
and again the goofy side will just make
sure that they don't slip out your hair
and stay in place all day long now this
beauty live hug is a special shout out
to all of us who have oily skin
sometimes when your face gets super oily
and you don't have any face powder on
you it's a literal disaster so this is a
cool trick that I have learnt all you
need to solve this issue is a bit of
tissue you can use any tissue paper or
toilet paper even and you're literally
just going to take that and just dab it
on your face like this and what that
piece of tissue is going to do is just
blot off any excess oil on your face and
leave your face looking much more matte
some people don't actually know this but
talcum powder is basically the same as
dry shampoo you can use this to put on
your hair and it's going to work in the
same
as a dry shampoo it's gonna absorb the
excess oil in your hair and leave your
hair looking much more refreshed and
less shiny this can get quite messy but
here I've got a bit of talcum powder and
all you have to do is that you just work
that into your hair the same as you
would with a dry shampoo and it works
like a charm I use this trick all the
time to refresh my hair if I don't have
any dry shampoo on me at the time
another hack that I have to do with hair
is that just take an eyeshadow like your
brow sort of shadow that you use for
your brows and just pop that on a fluffy
brush and then you just have to sort of
brush that through wherever your parting
is so say you've got black hair and
you've got a massive root right here you
can just take some black shadow and just
pop that over the light shade of your
hair so say if you've got blonde hair
naturally but you dye it black you can
just fill that roots in with some shadow
temporarily of course so you don't have
to dye your hair and this is obviously
for lazy people this is obviously a
temporary fix so it's not going to last
forever obviously so it's just going to
work if you really want to get rid of
your roots but you haven't had the
chance to dye your hair yet once you've
washed your brushes and they look a
little bit enough and flat like this to
preserve the fluffiness and softness of
them all you have to do is tip them
upside down and roll them between your
hands like this and as you can see it's
just opening up and getting rid of all
of the excess water doing this it's just
going to keep them nice and fluffy for
longer I don't know about you guys but I
have a funeral polishes that take
forever to dry this being one of them
and basically I'm just painting my nails
and to speed up the drying process of
your nail polishes all you have to do is
take a glass of cold water and dip your
nails in there and it's just gonna make
it dry instantly pretty much we've got a
little guess look I've got your guest
his name is Lucifer by the way he's my
new baby he just licked my nose work you
when applying your foundation 20 is
downward strokes as opposed to a buffing
motion because everyone has tiny little
hairs on their face and when you brush
downwards you're just patting
them down flat to the skin and this is
just going to create a softer and more
natural look if your mascara has
completely dried out but you are just
too attached to let it go
I've got you go I know the feels
basically what you can do is you can use
some eye drops like this for contact
lenses I've got my phone boots but you
can also use a makeup remover for your
eyes especially and another thing you
can use what was a makeup fix you can
also use makeup fix and just add a tiny
tiny drop to your mascara and this is
just going to prolong the mascara life
or for a few more uses obviously if your
mascara is like super super dead then
just get a new one but if your mascara
was kind of expensive or you just don't
have another one then this is a quick
fix to solve the problem and you can use
it a few times more now this hack is old
and gold and probably most of you know
it but it's important like I think it's
a good enough hack to include in this
video and basically that is to use a
chapstick before applying your lipstick
and it just makes all the difference in
the world now let's talk about coconut
oil it's just like a miracle ingredient
everyone knows this I had this thought
when I was about 15 and I thought wait a
second I'm moisturize my hair but I
don't moisturize my eyelashes maybe
that's why they're breaking all the time
maybe that's why they're dry so I
started putting coconut oil onto my
eyebrows and my eyelashes especially if
you wear eyeliner mascara and then you
remove at the end of the day it's just
going to strip all of your eyelashes of
that moisture that is necessary for it
to grow and stay healthy so that is
where coconut oil comes in and just
replenishes your eyebrows and your
eyelashes with that necessary moisture
that it needs to grow this next trick is
really good for people who suffer from
tired eyes all the time and if you want
to look less tired all you have to do is
take some nude or white eyeliner and
just run that across your lower
waterline
it's just gonna make your eyes appear
brighter and larger and in turn to make
them look much more awake if your eyes
wake up really puffy and really tired
after a sleepless night what you can do
is take two teaspoons like this and pop
them in the fridge or freezer for a few
minutes and then all you have to do is
just place them over your eyelids like
this and you can place them underneath
your eyelids just to get rid of any bags
and puffiness it's a great quick relief
for any bags underneath your eyes and
honestly feels great and to prevent
puffiness as a whole what you can do is
stack a few pillows a little bit higher
than the level of your body when you go
to sleep and let's just make sure that
all the fluids in your face are drained
from your face for up the night and then
turn that would just make sure that your
face is less puffy when you wake up so
that is all for this video I hope you
guys learn something cool today and I
hope you guys get inspired by this video

give a thumbs up so I know and maybe
I'll make more videos like this in the
future I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I will see you all in
my next one bye
