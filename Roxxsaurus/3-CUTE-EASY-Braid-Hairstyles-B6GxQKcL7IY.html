channel I hope you guys all well today
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
create a few braided hairstyles that are
really simple but really really
beautiful one of them is actually
inspired by the show Game of Thrones
even though I haven't seen it yeah don't
tell them what but I always see the
hairstyles online from the show and they
are absolutely beautiful so I thought I
would create like an inspired hairstyle
from gave me friends any other
hairstyles and just ones that I found on
the internet which I thought were really
cool so I am going to show you I've
answered it if you guys are new and have
never seen this space then definitely
subscribe to this channel as well as my
blog channel and also if you enjoyed
this video then definitely let me know
by giving me a thumbs up so that
probably less is your braids video for
this first hairstyle you want to
separate your hair into middle parting
and pull out some sections of hair at
the front of your face to frame it a
little bit better then you want to take
a chunk of hair at the top of your head
and start braiding this into a Dutch
braid
once you're done make sure to secure it
with a clear elastic and if you wish you
can tuck on the braid a little bit's you
add a little bit more volume then you
want to just repeat the same to the
other side and be sure to secure it with
a clear elastic once you've done that
you want to take the braids to the back
of your head and tie them together I'm
now returning back to the front and I'm
taking a chunk of hair just above the
ear and I'm starting to braid that into
a Dutch braid as well
once you have done that you want to take
those two braids to the back of your
head as well and securely tie them in
place now you want to gather all of your
hair and tie it together into a low
ponytail you can now remove the clear
elastics that were once there to secure
the braids as you no longer need them
and lastly if you would like to conceal
the hair tie you can take a strand of
hair and wrap it around and then pin it
in place with our hair grip to secure it
and that is the game of thrones inspired
hairstyle done I absolutely love this
hairstyle so much it's such a nice way
to spice up a regular ponytail for this
next one you want to again separate your
hair into a middle parting you want to
take a chunk of hair at the top of your
head and start braiding this into a
Dutch braid if you would like to see a
more detailed Dutch braid tutorial then
I will leave a link down in the
description as well as in the corner of
this video once you have secured the
braid you can go back and stretch this
braid out for added extra volume
and now what you want to do is repeat
the same thing to the other side this
time make sure to leave a strand of hair
at the back of your neck and this is
going to serve the hairstyle later on so
as you can see I have this thin piece of
hair at the back and I'm going to loop
this through each loop of my braid and
think of this technique as almost
sewing with a piece of thread we're
using the strand of hair to attach the
two braids together this looks quite
complicated but it's actually so much
easier once you are doing in once you
reach the bottom you just want to tie
the whole thing together and secure all
the hair in place add a few hair grips
here and there and you are done I
absolutely love this hairstyle so much
it's such a nice way to transform the
two regular Dutch braids into something
a little bit more edgy for this last
hairstyle I'm starting off with the same
top section and I'm just tying the two
braids off at the bottom next what you
want to do is take one of the ponytails
and just stop reading it with a fishtail
braid to create a fishtail braid you
want to separate the hair into two
sections and start taking thin strands
from each side and placing it onto the
other side to cross them over fishtail
braiding is actually really easy once
you get the hang of it and it looks so
effective I really love how fishtail
braids look so you just want to do that
all the way to the bottom and repeat the
same thing to the other side this is
quite an easy hairstyle but I feel like
the way the two braiding techniques
juxtaposed each other looks really
interesting and again it's just a nice
way to switch up the very common double
Dutch braid hairstyle
so that is all for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did then
definitely leave me a thumbs up so I
know and if you have any requests for
hairstyles you'd like me to do in the
future on my channel then please let me
know in the comments below
also let me know which one was your
favorite out of these hairstyles I think
my favorite one was the second one I
just think it's super cool also if you
would like to follow me on any of my
social media and my Twitter Instagram
and snapchat or rock Saurus same way
it's about here that's all for this
video I hope you guys are having a
wonderful morning evening night whatever
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye at the
moment I feel like it's quite a lot of
effort for something that's called a hat
like isn't a hat supposed to be
something that's gonna make your life
easier
I could like punch someone right now
