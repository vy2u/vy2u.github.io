I hope you're all doing well so today
I'm going to show you guys how to
achieve three different hairstyles are
using hair extensions I've never done a
hair tutorial using hair extensions so
I'm super excited and today I'm going to
be using my vixen and blush hair
extensions and these are the completely
seamless at clip in hair extensions
these are so easy to wear because there
is a layer of hair covering up the clips
so these are made from 100% Russian
Belgian hair which is so nice to the
touch and there are four different
pieces so there's the 100 gram piece
50 gram piece and two of the twelve
point 5 gram pieces because they're
completely seamless and this makes it so
easy to hide the fact that you're
wearing extensions which means that you
can rock so many hairstyles and although
these hair extensions are a little bit
on the pricey side I feel like it's so
so worth it because they are gonna last
you so much longer and then cheaper
alternatives so today I'm going to show
you guys at three of my favorite
hairstyles to wear with hair extensions
so let's get to it so to start off the
first hairstyle I'm going to section off
the top part of my hair and tie this up
I'm now going to take my hundred gram
piece hair extension and I'm just
placing that right underneath and then
just tucking this away with the
remaining part of my hair I'm then
sectioning off another piece now
including the hair extensions and I'm
clipping in the 50 gram piece underneath
and as you can see you can't even tell
that I'm wearing extensions I'm then
taking the 12.5 pieces and I'm just
clipping them in on the side and just
covering them up with the rest of my
hair and this is how the full head of
extensions look the first time I'm going
to do is section off a strand of hair
just on my face and this is going to be
left out of the braid I'm then taking
another chunk of hair just behind this
and I'm starting to braid this in a
regular Dutch braid
I'm then just pulling this apart to make
it a little bit more volumize and I'm
going to repeat the same thing to the
other side I'm then gathering all of the
hair including the braids and just tying
this into a low ponytail and letting
loose the rest of the braids to finish
off I'm taking a strand of hair to cover
up the hair tie and I'm clipping this in
place and this is what the hair cell
looks like it's so effortless and
because of the extensions the ponytail
looks really nice and volumize for the
next head start I'm clipping in just the
50 gram piece and I'm back homing the
front section at the top of my head I'm
then gathering this into a ponytail
which as you can see is really
volumizing because of the a hair
extension and then I'm just twisting the
ponytail into a kind of low bun
I think this hairstyle is a little bit
more unique because the top of the head
is quite volumize Dazz we back home debt
and it's not so flat
I think this hairstyle just looks really
classy and chic the next head style is
going to be a half updo half down D so
I'm just clipping in my hundred gram
hair extension piece and I'm taking two
sections from the front of my face and
tying this at the back I'm then going to
twist this into a little bun and clip
this in place with some bobby pins next
I'm just going to curl the ends of my
hair not going to high up into the hair
but kind of just having that subtle
color at the very bottom and this is the
finished look complete I really love
this one I find it so so adorable and
it's really like festive in my opinion
so that is all for my hair video I
really hope you guys enjoyed this and if
you did it smash that huge thumbs up

subscribed already then please do at the
button is just down below as well let me
know down below which one of these
hairstyles was your favorite I think my
favorite is definitely this one I really
love the cows and the little detailing
at the back I love the fact that my hair
feels so thick even though pretty much
half of it is okay so that's good for me
I really had
as I having a wonderful day and I'll see
you very soon in my next video bye
