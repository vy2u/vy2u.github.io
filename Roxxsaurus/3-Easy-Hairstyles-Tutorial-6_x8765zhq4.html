tutorial is a few bobby pins or hair
grips I've got these because they are
similar to my hair color but of course
use a color that matches your hair and
I've also got some hair ties that match
my hair too if you have any see-through
elastic bands and use those because
those will look better but I only have
these so I'm going to make do with what
I've got
oh and also have a hairbrush obviously
so the first hairstyle is a half updo
half down do I'm going to be creating
some volume at the top of our head and
for this I'm going to be using the video
5 refresh me quick dry shampoo and I'm
just going to spritz that into my roots
then what I'm doing is I'm taking the
front top half of my hair and I'm
bringing it back
I'm taking it to like a little hotel
just at the top of my head like this you
can't eat this if you want a bit more
volume but I'm going to leave it like
this
moment to be quite slick and then I'm
taking my hair tight and I'm tying that
in place now the next part is head start
is to braid this ponytail section and
we're going to be braiding that with a
fishtail braid so I'm splitting the
ponytail into two sections like this and
then I'm taking the outer strand of one
side and I'm placing it in the middle
then I'm taking the outer strand of the
other side and also placing that in the
middle so it sort of crosses over and
joins the other side keep this Clinic
tight and just continue doing that
throughout the whole brain
then to finish off the braid I'm taking
another hair tie and I'm just tying that
on the ends to secure it in place now
the next part of this tutorial is to
make at the braid really messy and more
volumize so all I'm doing is pulling
apart on each section like this to make
the braids look more messy and just a
bit thicker than it already is
so scared
now to make this even more interesting
you can curl your ends or even crimp
them whatever you wish and yeah I hope
you guys like this and let's move on to
the second hairstyle this next hairstyle
is really really easy to do but it's
very effective and it looks really
glamorous and classy I have my
hairstyles to be very messy usually so I
often take the top sections of my hair
and just tease them a little bit to add
the hairstyle a lot more of a undone
look like you just sort of roll out a
band and naturally your hair look
amazing so once you are borderline a
caveman looking like this you can move
on to the actual pest off so what I'm
going to be doing first is I'm going to
be taming this a little bit and then I'm
going to pop that in a low ponytail now
if you want a little bit of volume in
the top part of your hair you can just
hold the ponytail and sort of pull hair
out of it to create more volume and now
you're going to take the ponytail and
all you're going to be doing is twisting
it really really tight I have really
long hair so doing buns is sort of a
nightmare so I don't like to tease it or
anything because it already comes out
really big so all I'm doing is just
twisting it trying to make it as slim as
possible
so this is the second hairstyle and
let's move on to the third that's still
2/3 now this head site is probably the
cutest hairstyle of all time and I have
attempted to do it many many times and I
can never do it because of the length of
my hair but I'm gonna attempt it today
and hopefully it works so for those of
you who have shorter hair or like medium
length hair then it'll probably be
easier for you so what you need to do
first is gather your hair up into a high
ponytail you can flip your head over if
that makes it easier for you so that's
what I'm going to do so good twice and
then on the third one you're going to
take it from the back and you're going
to create a little loop like this so now
you have this lovely little tail at the
front of your face but I promise you
it's gonna look great so now you're
going to take care of this loop and
you're going to separate into two
sections like this and then you're going
to take this tail bad boy and you're
going to pull it through the middle a
bit like so now this is the part where
gets tricky
basically it's supposed to look like
this but because I still have quite some
hair at the back I need to put it
underneath one of the wings of the bow
sort of thing
and then all you're going to do is pin
that all in place and then all you have
to do is simply tug on the bow to kind
of fan it out and make it more volumize
this step is obviously up to you so you
can make it as big or as little as you
like so that is the end of this tutorial
