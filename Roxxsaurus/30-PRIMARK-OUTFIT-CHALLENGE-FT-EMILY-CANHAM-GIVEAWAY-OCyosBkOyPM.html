today I'm doing both very special guest
hi
so we are here and we're gonna be at
filming a Primark challenge yeah oh like
winter edition holiday yeah so basically
we bought each other outfits and it was
under 30 pounds and it was so hard so
difficult I actually couldn't even like
get a coat
no it was like pretty much the whole day
yeah yeah we got you come out fit so
basically I'm gonna be showing you guys
and what I got for Emily and in her
video she's gonna be showing you guys
what you got for me I'm also doing a
giveaway yeah we thought you're really
nice a bit of weight so we want to
involve you guys as much as possible so
we're gonna be giving away 250 pound
prymaat if cards wanna watch a lot of
roxies and it's super simple to enter
all you have to do is make sure you
subscribe to both of our channels thumbs
up both these videos and then you leave
us a comment down below and then we will
pick yeah yeah so excited for that but
if you guys wanna see what I picked up
for Emily's and okay guys so I am now in
the coat section and I'm just looking at
all the coat and now already like 30
pounds just by themselves and because
this is like a winter kind of challenge
I feel like you kind of need a coat I
mean I can't really skip that but at the
same time all the coats are so
overpriced so if I get home I won't be
able to get the rest of the outfit so
have no idea what I'm gonna do okay so
into each other in the shop yeah we may
hide our buys to like it's pretty much
like what the Alpha is based on my name
is on it basically like this great
oversized knit kill me but I got like
her size and because I wanted it to be a
bit long so kind of like serve as a
dress I suppose yeah I don't think that
should be long enough for you right yeah
yeah yeah yeah basically this was 10
pounds which I mean it's pretty much
like quarter of the budget yeah good for
a jumper like
in general terms uh-huh it's really high
neck as well we'll just serve like in at
the moment yeah I feel really good find
it's very like oversized and like
batwing kind of snow so that's yeah the
first day but I pretty much like the
main part of the outfit that's a winner
then I take another main thing and I
shoot I really like you I saw that
that's right so these were reduced from
16 pounds to six pounds yeah which was
insane I was like oh my god and they're
so like your style I feel I really like
the heel in them so I just had to get
those I'm sorry - you're beautiful yeah
that's so nice for winter this side
versatile you can like dress them up
dress them down like couple casual so
yeah that's pretty much like the main
part the outfit that I just got
accessories like I said I didn't really
get too many things
yeah but I feel like the office pretty
like well fit together anyways so I just
got like a little scarf because I'm
still didn't get Co so you stole them -
gave you my love scoffs yeah I stopped
like every day and this was like a
really nice like so black nice stop and
implanted Freetown so to complete
obviously yeah they have so many like
accessory using Primark is so good
and yeah two pounds can't really go
wrong love it and then oh it's very old
yeah and this was 9 pounds this was
pretty much yeah so I think in total I
spend 31 pounds so I did fit one pound
over the budget not allowed by hungry
but I mean yeah I just had to get those
that is so cute I'm gonna like complete
it I feel like that changes the out yes
it's giving it like a very casual like
cozy kind of I am here to get that love
that's the hours of what you think
yeah I'm hilarious I just try it on the
only thing is I want the jumper to be
long enough I know I don't know it's not
you might have to put yeah I think you
should be wait let me hold it up against
me I think it should be it might be I
know in my defense I thought I picked up
a size large yeah so what do you think
yeah cries yeah yeah we match so well
they add some color to the outfit which
is amazing the fact begs the q-tip I
love it I love the detail on it as well
and I just think we're both in it and
everything in the sermon texture let's
go yeah
I'm so sorry that was Emily's outfit why
don't you go got the jumper fitting yeah
I feel like that it would have been a
nightmare like just at my favorite being
like this bit just add so much the
outfit but yeah there wasn't really much
kind of accessory wises in like metal
yeah so it was added a really nice touch
and I think they do look really
expensive they did it like Topshop yeah
because the learners by grained as well
yeah they look really nice I think I'm
not really a hat person
yeah the Hat might perched on my head is
fun but I don't think like the we're
outside being bothered about it like
where's you really see I need so just
like try and wear them yeah yeah I love
it I'm all about a scarf and anissa's
jumper so yeah you know
