hi guys today I'm going to be filming at
four different back-to-school hairstyle
this is going to involve curled hair but
of course if you don't have curly hair
you can curl it or you can even do any
of these tutorials with straight hair or
wavy hair whichever hair type you have
for this tutorial I curled my head
because I thought it'd be a little bit
different to my previous back-to-school
hair tutorials and the curling iron that
I use is this Remington curling wand
I've had this for years and I absolutely
love it one of my favorites and you
achieve these nice little ring cars love
this so I really recommend using a wand
this hairstyle is a little cute bow at
the back of your head and it sort of
reminds me of a Disney Princess
hairstyle like Ariel or Bell or
something like that and I think it's
super cute and very easy to do so I'm
going to show you how to do it right now
so all you have to do is part your hair
and it can be in the middle or if you
like to have it a little on the side and
that's fine too then what we're going to
do is we're going to take these front
sections of our hair but keeping a
little bit next to the ear just so that
it frames the face a little bit better
so we're going to take these two
sections and kick them all the way to
the back now if you like a little bit of
volume you can always tease these front
sections first before taking them to the
back but because I've combed my hair and
I've got quite a bit of hair anyway I
don't really need to do this but feel
free to add in that step if you like so
what I'm doing is I'm taking these two
sections of the hair and I'm tying them
in place
now before you do the last time you want
to loop in the Hat a little bit just
like this creating this tiny loop and
what you're going to do is separate that
into like this next part is to take this
little bit of hat and loop it over the
bow like this then you're going to take
two fingers inside underneath where
we've created the bow and I'm going to
loop that hair through just like that
the next step is of course to pin
everything into place with bobby pins
so that is the finished hairstyle I
think it's so cute and it's not even
that hard to do I mean it will take a
few tries to do it and get it right at
first because it's quite hard to get it
and perfect and how you want to look at
the back as you can't see
so I recommend having a mirror for this
um so you can see what you're doing at
the back this next hairstyle is super
super simple all you need is some bobby
pins and what you're going to be doing
is taking these front sections out of
your face once again and we're doing is
just twisting them and clipping them
back and it's so so quick it literally
takes like 5 secs so I'm just taking a
section of hair from each side and again
you can tease these if you want a little
bit more volume and if you would like it
to look a little bit more messy so I'm
just taking the first section I'm
twisting yet like this and I'm just
gonna kind of pin it but have a little
bit upwards so it's like a little
ponytail in a way I find that if you
crisscross your bobby pins then your
hairstyle will last much longer and then
I'm just repeating the same to the other
side
you can pull out little bits of hair
just to frame the face a little bit
better at the front so like I said super
super easy very simple and it literally
takes no time at all so if you're
rushing for school you can definitely do
this hairstyle really quick in no time
this next hairstyle involves you to take
all of your hair to one side and this is
going to be sort of like a braid but
it's not going to be a braid it's gonna
be a little roll before you put any of
your hair up I recommend taking a little
piece of hair on the side that's
opposite to the braid and that tiny
strand of hair is just going to make all
the difference it's going to frame the
face a little bit better and make it
look much more messy so once that's
sorted I'm taking all of my hair and I'm
just simply gonna half it in two
sections like this so first we can work
on the bottom section so we can put this
behind our back what we're going to do
with the bottom section is we're going
to roll it in one direction and make
sure it doesn't unroll so keep hold of
it once you've rolled your hair up you
can take in the other section of your
hair and roll it in the other direction
and I know this may be a little bit
tricky but you can do it I believe in
you and I also recommend to take a tiny
tiny bit of hair from this side as well
so once you've got these two rolls of
hair and they're rolled in the opposite
direction what you're going to do is
you're just going to start twisting them
on each other now this kind of is tricky
because you have to make sure that these
stay rolled up so just take your time
with this and really examine which way
the roll is um rolled up so you can keep
that movement of it and the reason why
we rolled it in different directions is
because it will stop it from unraveling
once you've got the desired roll all
done you can make it a little bit looser
a little bit more messy by just back
combing it like this from your hand now
as you can see this hair cell is very
similar to what a braid would do but
this is a little bit more different
because a braid is done so so often so I
thought it was a nice little twist on it
do you get that twist I'm not funny I
think it's really cute and it's really
simple to do it just gives a little bit
of a different feel to your hair and
this last hairstyle is a
I've ponytail but with braids coming
down on each side I think it's really
beautiful and very simple to do and it's
definitely a good way to spice up your
regular ponytail taking quite a large
chunk of hair at the front of my face
and I'm just going to start braiding
that I'm going to braid this quite
loosely because we're going to pull it
apart anyway so before you tie it or
secure it in any way make sure you pull
out the braids a little bit just to give
it a little bit more texture and volume
and then I'm just going to secure that
with a hair tie next we're just going to
do the same thing to the other side
in once again I pulled out the braid a
little bit just to add a little bit more
texture and I'm just tying that in place
now for this but all you need to do is
gather all the hair and pull it into a
low ponytail at this point we can get
rid of the hair ties that we've placed
because we no longer needed them to
secure the braids and all you need to do
is just tie the whole thing together as
if you had to cover the hair bubble all
you have to do is take a strand of hair
from the underneath of your ponytail and
just wrap that around the piece then if
you take a bobby pin
and you just pin up that in place
so those are my four back-to-school
hairstyles I hope you guys enjoyed them
