different hairstyles for school the
hairstyles that you're going to see in
this video are ones that I posted a
picture on Instagram and loads of you
said that you really really liked it so
let's just jump right in so the things
that you're going to need for these
hairstyles are a hairbrush the one that
I'm using is the tangle teezer then the
next thing is hair grips or bobby pins
and a hair ball this is optional but you
can also have these tiny tiny little
see-through our elastic bands I don't
know if you can even see that but they
are really useful because you can't see
them the first hairstyle is going to be
really really simple and what you're
going to do is just take all of your
hair back into a high ponytail
like so you can also flip your head over
if that makes it easier for you and I'm
going to take a scrunchie just a black
scrunchie like this you think is a heavy
ball but my hair is so thick and heavy
that a normal hair bubble won't support
it so I'm going to use a scrunchie
so now you're after with a high ponytail
you can pull some hair bits out to make
it a bit more volumize and then take
some bits out by the ears to kind of
frame your face a little bit better and
then with the ponytail which is going to
braid it but we're not going to braid it
like the usual braid we're going to use
a fishtail braid to braid it so what you
do is you take the ponytail into two
bits like so two even parts and then you
take the out of it like a strand of the
outer hair and put it on the other side
and then you take the other side and do
the same and so on and so on
the thinner the strands are the better
it will look so I really recommend to
take your time with it and just take
tiny strands of hair and add them to the
other side and make it quite tight as
well
once your breed is done you can just
simply use one of the clear elastics and
just tie it to make the braid a little
bit more volumizer you can tug on the
strands like so and that will just make
the braid a lot more thicker and fuller
if you like how it looks neat like this
then that's the hairstyle done but if
you like it a little bit more messy like
me then you can literally just brush up
the hair strands that'll make it much
more messy and undone also from this
hair side you could also make a bun by
just wrapping the braids around the
scrunchie and it would make this really
nice fishtail button so this is the
first test out and let's move on to the
second one the nose hair style requires
you to get a middle parting so I'm just
going to part my hair bang in the middle
once your hair is parted in the middle
you can start braiding and for this
hairstyle we're actually going to do a
double braid on each side starting from
here pretty much like a fishtail braid
what we're going to be doing the regular
braid instead so we're going to take a
little section of hair just at the front
and part it into three sections
but then the trick part is we're going
to not put it over like a usual break
but we're going to put it underneath and
the next run underneath as well and then
I'm going to take a little section of
the hair and add it to the already
existing strand and just continue that
same pattern throughout the whole braid
you
once that's done we're going to take a
clip
you
and this is what my hairstyle looks like
again if you want to make it a bit more
messy you can just kind of like back
comb the braids and separate them a
little bit and it'll just make them look
much more undone and messy can kind of
just like mess it up pull some bits out
and there you go the next hairstyle is
the fishtail buns and I dip this hair
start in my previous video and you guys
really seemed to enjoy it so I'm going
to show you how to do it so basically
you just take two braids and you
literally make them into buns like so
just like a regular bun you wrap it
round and then secure it with a hair tie
then I'm going to take a bobby pin and
just kind of secure into place then
we're just going to do the same with the
other
this is the final hair so this is
probably one of my favorite hairstyles
so far I really like it I like how the
bread kind of protrudes from the hair as
opposed to I'm going in like a regular
braid and I just think it's really
really nice and like different so I
really recommend for you guys to try it
out this last hairstyle also requires a
middle parting and what we're going to
be doing is braiding these front
sections into the back and then creating
a little bun behind it I came up with
this hairstyle not too long ago and I've
posted a photo on Instagram and loads of
you guys said that you wanted to see a
tutorial so here it is so we're going to
start with taking a section just like in
the previous hairstyle and we're going
to braid it in the same manner so split
it into three parts and start braiding
it underneath like so and then add a
little tiny section to it and braid it
in and so on and so on
try not to take this section because
that's what's going to frame your face
and make it look a lot better once you
feel like you've got enough hair kind of
braided you can just stop adding strands
and just carry on braiding it by itself
once you've raided the braids you can
just tie it with the clear elastic and
then you can sweep eat the same to the
other side
you
then before we put the braids together
at the back we're gonna take each braid
and kind of pull it apart to make it
more organized
now what we're going to do is take the
two braids and meet them at the back
like so and then we're going to take a
small elastic band
you
you can leave the hairstyle like this
and just take the two braids apart to
kind of make it a bit more flowing with
rest of the hair but if you want to
carry on with the hairstyle I'm going to
show you all you have to do is just kind
of take the two braids and make them
into a little bun and what I like about
this hairstyle is that when you put the
braids into a bun it kind of looks like
a tiny little rose and it's just really
really cute so it's going to show you
how to do that real quick only take the
two braids and literally just start
making them into a tiny little bun then
we're tickle a stick and tie and plate
net if you want you can take a little
bobby pin and just kind of secure it
into place so that's it for this
hairstyle I really love this I think
it's really unique and I haven't seen
many hairstyles like this around yet I
hope you guys try these hairstyles out
