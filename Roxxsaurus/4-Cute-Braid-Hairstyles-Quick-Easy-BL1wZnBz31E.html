filming a hair tutorial including four
different easy braided hairstyles so I
hope you guys enjoy this don't forget to
give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe and let's just jump straight
to the video so for this first hairstyle
you're going to need is some argan oil
to smooth down your hair you can also
use water if you don't have any but I'm
just going to be using the nume argan
oil today then of course you also need a
hairbrush and some hair ties so the
first thing I'm going to do is flip in
my head and gather all of my hair into a
high ponytail now that I have my high
ponytail I'm just going to use my argan
oil to kind of go through the ends to
smooth them out next what you want to do
is split your ponytail into two sections
like so and we're only going to be
taking care of one at the moment so I'm
going to tie one of the sections and put
it to the back so everywhere we've got
this one section and we're going to
again split this into two sections like
so and then what you want to start doing
is creating like a rope twist so you
want to twist one section and you want
to put it underneath the other twist
this one in the same direction and put
it underneath the other and then twist
this one section and put it underneath
the other and you just want to repeat
this step over and over and the reason
why we're doing this is because if you
were just to twist two strands together
they would unravel even with a hair tie
so this is just ensuring that it's going
to stay in place even after we let go of
it so then I'm going to tie this back so
now that we're done with this section we
can move on to the other section and
literally just repeat the same step so
you want to separate it into two
sections like the other twist it put it
underneath twist that one put it
underneath twist this one put it
underneath and the direction in which
I'm twisting it is always to the left
and here we are we've got two right
twists at the moment and what you want
to do now is just wrap them around each
other same direction that you are
wrapping the twist to themselves so then
you can just take off the two
ties and tie the whole braid together
and that is it a really cool and really
easy braid and I really like it because
it's actually really unusual and it
looks like you've taken a lot of time to
do but it actually took you like two
seconds and it's super easy so the next
tester it's actually a transformation of
the previous hairstyle and all you want
to do for this hairstyle is just wrap
the braid around itself into a little
top bun and then we're just going to
secure that in place with a hair tie if
you want you can also pull some of your
hair out a little bit just to kind of
give more volume to the base of your
hair like this and also you can pull out
some bits by your ears just to frame
your face a little bit better and that
is the final look a really cool top bun
with this really nice texture going all
through it so for this next test up what
you're going to need is some dry shampoo
the one I'm using is the Hubbell
essences clearly naked dry shampoo I
love this one it smells so so good it
smells of like mint and it's really
refreshing it doesn't give you that
really dry texture to roots so I really
recommend this and then you're also
going to need a little comb so first of
all we're going to spray this into our
roots just to give ourselves a little
bit of volume to work with an
alternative to dry shampoo is also of
course hairspray but I don't like using
hairspray just because it's really
drying and makes my hair really stiff so
then I'm going to take the front top
sections of my hair and just backcomb
them so I'm going to start at the back
and just do a little bit by bit
so with this hairstyle we're really just
trying to build up loads of volume into
the crown of our head so now that we've
back home to this section of our head we
can reach off to the side of our head
and kind of take a little bit underneath
here like a really concealed section of
hair that you isn't going to be too
noticeable that it's actually missing
and we're just going to braid this you
can braid this in any kind of way that
you like I think I'm just going to braid
it in a Dutch braid so before we tie
that in place we want to kind of pull on
the braids to make it a little bit more
volume eyes and a little bit thicker
than it is I'm going to go ahead and tie
that in place how much you're just going
to go ahead and pull that braid out even
more so then what you want to do is you
want to take this braid and place it
over the front section of your hair and
you also want to conceal it underneath
some of their head just here so you will
need some help of your trusty bobby pins
to pin this bad boy in place so now you
just want to spread out the volumize
section and tease it anywhere else that
you feel like you haven't got enough
volume and now that you have your
desired volume you can take these front
sections that we've left behind and you
want to kind of pull them across the
braid and also the volume eye section
and it's just going to conceal that
little gap here where we kind of took
the braid from and again for this you're
going to need some bobby pins to pin
that in place this is the final
hairstyle it takes a little bit more
effort than the other two that I've
previously showed you but I feel like
it's a really nice hairstyle like a
party that looks quite dramatic but I
feel like it looks quite feminine and
delicate at the same time and for this
last hairstyle we're going to be
creating a side parting first and then
we're going to be braiding this site so
I'm just taking three small strands of
my hair I'm going to start braiding that
in a regular braid so I'm placing one
strand over and then the other strand
over and then I'm
another section of hair from the back
and putting that into the middle and
then same for this one so I'm taking
another strand from the front and I'm
placing that into the middle and then
taking another strand from the back
placing that over into the middle and
then another strand from the front and
placing that into the middle
so once you get to the area of the back
of your ear you can just stop and secure
that with a hair tie
and what you then wanna do is take the
remaining hair and just pop that off to
the one side and you can just begin to
twist this and we're going to be
creating this into a bun and we're going
to take the remaining new hair on the
left and take it round the back and also
start twisting this we're going to
secure that again with a hair tie and
then we're just going to place some
bobby pins into it to kind of secure it
into place you can now pull some
sections out just by your ears to frame
your face a little bit better so there's
my four braided hairstyles I hope you
