channel I hope you guys are doing super
well I'm super excited for today's video
because I feel like I haven't done a
hair tutorial video in a while so I'm
coming back at you guys with another
hands-on video in today's video I'm
gonna show you guys four simple a cute
hairstyle you can wear for school or for
why all the education that goes like but
the name personal video is not any
ordinary household video I am actually
dyeing my hair pink in this video I
haven't want you to dye my hair pink or
like any funky color that's a really
bright and colorful too so so long but I
haven't had the guts to do it so in
today's video I'm happy paired up with
L'Oreal Paris and I'm going to be using
their new color ease to wash out hair
dyes so my color today is the dirty pink
I am mostly so excited to try this
because the color is just gorgeous they
have so many colors to choose from this
only lasts from once a few weeks meaning
that if I don't like the color I can
just wash it out but I'm pretty sure I'm
going to love anything I might actually
die my head of color permanently who
knows in color Easter eggs they also
have these one-day sprays that you can
listen to spray to your hair how's the
color for the day and push it out when
you're done with it it is so logical and
non permanent so if you're like me and
you're kind of scared about trying out
different colors
this isn't it too perfect for you if we
can get this video to a forty thousand
like I'm going to actually give away
some of the colors from the range
because I have the whole range in front
of me and I feel like I would be able to
go through all of them myself so if you
guys would like me to do a giveaway on
those make sure you give this video
thumbs up and let's try to get it -
$14,000 new and let's get into this
video so as I already mentioned I'm
using you dirty pink one to two week
wash in color before you sir make sure
you're using a towel to cover your
clothes and wearing plastic gloves that
are provided in the box I've also done
the patch test behind my ear 48 hours
prior to dyeing my hair so make sure you
do that as well
oh and just to clarify if you're
planning on using the color Easter range
on the medium to dark hair you either
have to lighten your hair beforehand or
use these vivid shapes which will work
on darker hair I would really love it if
you guys joined the coastal hair squad
and tied your selfies which has to do it
your way so I can see your mermaid hair
as well
okay guys so the headlight is now on I'm
never the way around 15 minutes and then
under the water now and see how it looks
so guys I am back this is the finished
on break I love how it turned out my
hair feels so good but let's move on to
the first hairstyle so for the power
castle I'm going to split my hair into a
middle parting all the way down to the
back of my hair and separate my hair
into two sections like that so what you
wanna do is take a top chunk of your
hair by your face and start raising this
into a Dutch braid but after the first
time you have braided it you want to add
a chunk of hair from just behind the
section under start doing this for every
section of the hair and just continue
until you get to the very back of your
head now look the size I hope your hair
is finished you wanna do the same thing
to the other side once your braids are
nice and secure you then want to take a
curling wand and start curling the
strength of your hair this will create a
really nice girly and feminine look but
you can also have it straight whichever
one you prefer and this is my final hair
so I absolutely love it so so much is
really easy to recreate and honestly
Angela's hair would be really easy to
rock at school or even at the gym moving
on to the second hairstyle this one is
really easy to recreate but it's super
light bohemian and it's also really good
to get your hair out of your face while
still having your hair down the side
thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna take
a strand of hair just from here I'm
going to leave a stronger by my face to
frame it a little bit better and I'm
actually going to start braiding this
into a fishtail braid so I'm separating
the section is the two parts like this
I'm going to take a smaller section from
the left hand side and lock it over into
the middle of the other strand I'm then
going to do the exact same thing from
the other side from particular strands
of hair placing that over and into the
middle you want to keep doing that this
is quite time consuming process but once
you get it it's gonna look really good
once you have finished braiding one side
of your hair you can then move on to the
other side and basically repeat the same
step and then take both of those braids
to the back of your head and then also
taking another strand of loose hair and
I'm incorporating that into the final
hair cells I really like the contrast of
the braid and the loose hair strands
together I think it looks really nice
and bohemian hey guys
a second two hairstyles I was completely
romantic and I am obsessed with color
they actually ended up diluting the
dials a little bit of conditioner which
is what gave us really nice light pink
sparkly color even more slower than the
original color in the tub and it works
super well fresco as you can really play
around with the color and depailler it
to whatever you like but now let's move
all you to stand heads up so for this
hairstyle what you want to do is take a
cop chunk of your hair and basically pop
it into a high ponytail and then
twisting the ponytail into a bun and
securing that with a clear elastic type
and that is pretty much if I am however
going to go ahead and curl my hair you
can also skip the step if you like but I
just think that it really adds a nice
feminine touch to the hair and for the
last half hour what you want to do is
take two strands of hair by your face
and leave those out you don't want to
take the rest of your hair and start
putting them up into a high tone
yourselves you don't want to grab your
two ponytails and tie them into a knot
whilst taking the ends and tucking them
into the bun this is quite complicated
to explain but I feel like it's pretty
self-explanatory and the finish the
textile off I'm just gonna coat the two
stranded by my face this hairstyle is
perfect for those days where you just
want to get your hair out of your face
but you saw her look really cute today
to Maya for easy hair so I really hope
you guys enjoyed this and if you did
