channel so as you can see by the title
today I am coming back with yet another
hairstyle video I have already done a
ton of hair cell videos on my channel
already as you guys probably already
know but I'll link all of those down
below in a playlist so you guys can
check those out if you haven't seen them
already before today's video I'm gonna
show you guys 4 different
braided hairstyles but I have recently
seen on Pinterest and they have super
inspired me to do this video for you
guys I know it can be kind of a struggle
to think of like new original hairstyles
but I saw these and I was like oh my god
I need to recreate them if you guys
enjoy our hairstyle videos I would like
to see more do make sure you smash that
huge thumbs up just down below and also
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't
already go there for ado let's get on
into the video ok so for hair so number
1 the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take my brush and basically just
pop my hair into a middle parting so now
our hair is in a middle parting the
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
section off two chunks of hair right by
my face on either side like so what I'm
gonna do is it just section off at one
of them with a hair tie so that it
doesn't get mixed up with the rest of
our hair and once I've done that I'm
gonna start working on the other section
and all you want to do is just basically
braided this strand into a thin little
braid once I get to the very bottom of
my braid what I'm gonna do is I'm just
going to take a clear elastic hair tie
like this and literally just secure the
very end of that braid so that it
doesn't come undone as my braid is nice
and secure I'm then gonna move on to the
other section and repeat the same thing
the first turn that the next step is to
take another two strands of hair from
either side of my face and basically
repeat the same step all over again so
now that my third braid is complete I'm
gonna move on to the very last section
of this hairstyle and I'm going to braid
the fourth section
okay so now that I have my four braids
completed the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm gonna take the two strands
that are right next to my face and what
I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna take
them together and tie them up right
under my chin this is gonna look super
weird but hear me out once we flip it
over it's gonna look amazing but then
I'm gonna take the other two braids and
I'm basically going to attach them like
so with a clear elastic tie I'm just
gonna tie this section right here and
also at the other side now that my hair
is finished and tied together into this
sort of pattern what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually going to take them and flip it
over onto the other side like so
and this is the finished hair so it may
not look like much from the front but
this is what it looks like from the back
I love how quick and easy this is to do
all you have to know how to do is how to
braid and then just how to tie two
braids together which i think is so easy
and I love the fact that you don't have
to hold your arms up in the air trying
to braid your hair in the back which can
get kind of difficult sometimes before
we jump straight into the second
hairstyle I quickly wanted to talk about
a few hair products that I have been
loving recently you guys always ask me
what sort of products I use for my hair
so I thought this might be quite
beneficial to some of you guys to
basically get to know what sort of
products I use so I've recently started
using this a range of Maui Moisture
products for my hair so this is a brand
that you can purchase at Boots and
basically they are so amazing they smell
great and they're all vegan as well
which is just so-so also the great thing
about these is that they have at five
different ranges for different hair
types this one is a for chemically
damaged hair which you guys know is my
hair all over because I have dyed my
hair so many times here I have the
shampoo conditioner and also a hair mask
that I have been trying out recently and
honestly I have to say hands down this
has made my hair so soft the reason why
I really like these is because there's
no parabens and no sulfates no
artificial colors which is so damaging
for the hair these products have it none
of that they actually have aloe vera
juice in them as well as coconut water
which is just so amazing for the hair I
actually use this whole range to wash my
hair with today and as you can see my
hair is just so smooth at the moment it
just looks really nourished and really
hydrated which is exactly what I need
you'd say yes these are the products
that I have been used
recently and I absolutely loved them so
I would 100% recommend for you guys to
try them if you do have a chemically
damaged hand like me I have a bit more
information about them in the
description as well but anyways let's
move on to the second hairstyle so for
the second hairstyle what we're gonna do
first is we're going to take a chunk of
hair right above our forehead like so
now that we've sectioned off I'm now
going to split this into three sections
are like so and I'm going to start
braiding this with a inverted braid so
instead of going over the braid like we
usually do I'm actually gonna take each
strand underneath I think this is called
a Dutch braid now to finish up the braid
I'm just gonna take a clear elastic hair
tie and secure that right at the end now
the next step is to tag at these two
sections of your hair from either side
of your face and basically repeat the
same thing so I'm gonna take the first
chunk and I'm gonna start braiding that
with a inverted Dutch braid so now i
braid is secure I'm then gonna take it
the other side and basically repeat the
same thing looking like an alien with
these two braids coming up my head what
we're gonna do is we're gonna take each
of the braids and basically just tug on
them just to make them a little bit more
volumize and make them a lot more
thicker than they really are as you can
see doing theirs it makes a world of
difference so now my braids are a lot
more volumizer what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take them to the back of my head
and tie them all together so once you
have secured all of your braids at the
back what you want to do is you want to
pull apart the section that is not
braided like so this just creates a
little bit of detail and volume right
there and now that we've tied off of the
remainder of the braids that we can then
take the braids at the bottom apart and
remove the extra hair ties to let the
hair flow down at free me once you have
completed that step what you want to do
is you want to take another two sections
from either side of your face just a
very thin ones and then you also want to
braid those as well
and once again at once those two braids
are complete what you want to do is just
take them to the back and tie them
together so then once your braids are
tied together what you want to do once
again is take the section that is not
braided and pull it apart just to kind
of echo the same thing that you did the
first time but once again now that your
braids are tied off you can then take
out the extra hair ties and now to
complete the hair cell the very last
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
braid the remainder off the hair and tie
it off so this is what the finish hair
song looks like I am in love with this
hairstyle it looks so much more
difficult than it really is because all
you're really doing is just creating a
bunch of braids and then tying it
together again though this kind of looks
like a hard hairstyle to do but trust me
once you start doing it and once you get
the hang of it it honestly is not that
hard axel but now let's move on to
hairstyle number three
so for the third hairstyle what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna be
creating kind of like a glamour ponytail
is super simple to do but it looks so
pretty the first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna take two chunks of hair from
either side of our face so once I've got
my two strands that separated what you
want to do is you want to start twisting
each of the strands away from your face
like so and then gonna repeat the same
thing to the other side unless we have
twisted those sections what I'm gonna do
is I'm just going to take them to the
back like so and then tie them off with
a clear elastic tie what you want to do
now is you want to pull apart those
sections just a little bit to make them
a little bit more volumize and look more
full once you have a major twist a lot
more volume eyes as I have done here you
then want to gather the rest of your
hair and just secure them into a
ponytail and to finish off the ponytail
you then just want to grab a strand of
hair from underneath and twist this
around the hair tie to conceal it and to
finish off the hair so what you want to
do is you just want to pull out some
strands of hair just by your face just
to frame it a little bit better and that
is the hairstyle
finished I absolutely love how this
looks it's such an easy way to spice up
a regular ponytail it's just like a
really easy way to get your hair out of
your face but still looks super cute but
now it lets me onto hair so at number
four okay so far this very last hair
what you wanna do is you want to make
sure that you have a middle parting and
then we're gonna start off by taking it
to chunks of hair just up from the top
of the head I'm actually going to use at
my tangle teezer to help me gather this
all the way to the top of my head and
once I have a good grip of my hair I'm
then gonna just tie this off with a high
tide I love towards at the side of my
head so once you have done it to the one
side you then just want to repeat the
same thing it's to the other side so now
that I have that these little ponytails
that what we gonna do is we're gonna
start braiding them into a fishtail
braid so what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna just split the ponytail
into two sections like so so the first
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take
the outer strand off of one of the
strands and we're gonna place them into
the middle like so and then we're gonna
do the same thing from the other side so
you wanna take a thin strand flip it
over and place it on the other side in
the middle so that's essentially how you
do a fishtail braid you just repeat that
same step over and over again but you
have to make sure that you pull the
strands in quite tight so that it
doesn't come undone a fishtail braid is
probably the most time-consuming braid
because you are working in such small
sections but trust me once you get the
hang of it it is so worth it once you
have your braid secured what you want to
do is you want to start pulling a part
of the braid from each section and
basically this is going to again make it
a lot more volume eyes and a lot bigger
than it really is
this step is super important because
this is obviously going to be your bun
so you want it to be as voluptuous as
possible but once your braid is all
pulled apart you then it just want to
repeat the same thing to the other side
now let's see how both of you break
complete what you want to do is you just
want to start wrapping the braid around
itself like so to form the bun so this
is the finished hairstyle I really
really like this I think it's so quick I
see this hairstyle all over the internet
all the time and I just think it looks
so cute for like summer and even
festivals or something like that I
really hope you guys enjoyed these
