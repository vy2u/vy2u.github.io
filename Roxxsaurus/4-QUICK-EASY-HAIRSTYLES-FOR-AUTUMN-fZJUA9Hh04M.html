today I have four different autumnal
hairstyles for you guys which are really
easy and simple to recreate I haven't
done a so video in a hot minute so I
thought I'd just sit down and show you
guys at these four hair cells that I've
really been liking lately for autumn if
you guys are brand new here make sure
you guys that subscribe to us down below
and also be sure to hit that Bell button
as well because you guys want to get
notified of every time I post a new
video and sometimes YouTube messes up so
make sure you guys are press it just
down below okay but without for rambling
let's get on into the video okay so this
first hair self I've really been
enjoying like on other people recently
is like a really messy kind of high
ponytail with like a lot of volume like
in the crown right here so first of what
we're gonna do is we're gonna create
some volume in the root right here so
for this I'm gonna be taking my batiste
dry shampoo this is the fruity and
cheeky cherry I really like this one so
I'm just gonna take my hair and kind of
spritz some right into the crown just
into the roof this dry shampoo smells so
good so once you have a bit of volume in
there and then you take my tangle teezer
brush and i'm just going to backcomb
that ever so slightly and then gonna
take this top section right here and I'm
just gonna make sure that that's really
nicely back home as well just to give
the whole head a lot more volume so now
that our hair is looking somewhat like
this I'm gonna take all of my hat and
kind of position it towards the back of
my head into a high ponytail now once
you have a hold of all of your hands
before you actually tie it in place what
you want to do is you just want to kind
of tug on the room and lift it up like
so just to put that volume and back into
the hair so when you have something like
this you can then it's hide
in a place with a hair tie though now
that your hair is all nicely tied up
what you can do is take some strands of
hair just by your face like your ears
and also just the kind of hair framing
your face and just pull that out to
really kind of make this hair bit more
messy and undone and I'm also gonna take
a strand of hair just and below the
ponytail like so and wrap that around to
the actual hair bubble just to concealer
and to make sure that you can't see it
once I wrapped it around I'm just going
to take a bobby pin and a piece that
through the ponytail to keep it together
and this is the finished hay style I
love it so much I think it's so autumnal
I love how classy and put together it's
made me love but it's honestly so easy
to create now I hope this next has that
we're gonna be creating a little braid
going down the back of our hand which is
super cute and really easy to do so the
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take in the two sections of my hair by
my face and I'm going to a section knees
off from the rest of my hair and take
them a towards the back of my head where
I'm gonna start creating a braid I'm
also gonna take a chunk of hair from the
very center of the back of my head and
incorporate this into the braid so that
we can create a regular Dutch braid once
I've done that I'm just going to add
some additional sections of hair from
each side of my head and just
incorporate that into the braid as you
can see here and once you finish adding
additional sections of hair to your
break and just finish off the braid by
braiding the rest of the hair kind of to
the halfway point of your hair length
and then just tie it off with a clear
elastic tie and this is the finished
hairstyle it's super simple just to get
your hair out of your face and have a
really cool design at the back of your
head it's very subtle but it's really
easy to recreate okay so now video to
the third hairstyle we're gonna be
creating a little bow at the back of our
head which is so cute for autumn so the
first thing you want to do is section
off two chunks of head just by your face
like the previous hairstyle now with the
two chunks of hair you can do whatever
you could braid them if you wanted but
I'm just gonna simply twist them
outwards like this I'm gonna take these
two sections of hair to the back of my
head and tie them together with a clear
elastic time and then they take that
strand of hair that we've just tied off
and they create a small
and tie that in place with another clear
elastic tie once you've done that you
can then separate the loop into two
sections and create the bow shape once
you've done that you can then pin this
in place with a bobby pin
once your bow is pinned into place you
can then take a strand of hair just
underneath it and kind of loop it over
and under the boat I'm not very good at
explaining this part but I'm sure you
can see what I'm doing here this is just
going to conceal that place where we
separated the loop and created a boat
and the last hairstyle is a braided updo
so what we're going to do first is we're
gonna section off our hair into three
sections like us so once we've done that
we can then at take each section and
literally just start braiding it as
you're breathing each section you want
to kind of make sure that you're
braiding it to them back because that's
where it's gonna be situated at the end
when you have your three braids you just
want to kind of a toggle number two it
makes them a bit more separated and a
bit more volumize just to add at that
ultimate thickness to them once your
braids are nicely separated and
volumizing you can then start rolling
them up towards your head and pin them
in place and this is the finished
hairstyle I honestly love this one so
much because it's so easy to do it's
really quick and simple but it feels so
feminine and I just really really like
it so those are my four easy autumn
hairstyles I really hope you guys
