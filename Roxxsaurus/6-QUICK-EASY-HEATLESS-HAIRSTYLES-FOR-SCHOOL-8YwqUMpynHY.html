you guys are having an awesome day so
far so today's video is another hair
tutorial and in this video I'm going to
be showing you guys how to create these
easy go-to hairstyles are quick and
heatless if you guys enjoyed this don't
forget to thumbs up and subscribe for
more videos like this so the first
hairstyle is this messy topknot bun so
once your hair is gathered to the very
top of your head what you want to do is
kind of tie it once and then on the
second loop you want to thread all of
your hair kind of almost through and
then use the remaining bit of your hair
tie to just kind of loop it through one
more so once I left with this big giant
loop on your head what you kind of want
to do is just tame it and put it into
place
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take it to the back and then kind of
close it in like so
so once you've run it is all pinned in
place what you want to do is just tug on
little hair and just kind of make it
more volume eyes and bit more messy you
can pull out some sections of hair just
to frame the face a little bit better
and that is pretty much it and that is
the finished hairstyle is so it's simple
and easy to do but I love how it works I
think it's so so pretty now moving on to
hair cell 2 we're going to start off
with our hair down once again and the
first thing I'm going to do is actually
take two parts of my hair out of the
equation and we're going to leave these
to the side because we're going to braid
these out later so now that we have
sectioned off a part of our hair we're
going to take the rest of the head to
the back and I'm actually going to be
putting half of it up into a little
ponytail so now that this portion of my
hair is now six your back I'm going to
focus on these two parts of my hair and
I'm just basically going to start
braiding this into a regular braid so
now that my two braids are finished I'm
going to return it through the back
ponytail and braided this as well
and our lastly I'm just going to twirl
the braids into a bun and just pin this
in place with some bobby pins so this is
the hair cell number two I absolutely
love how it turned out I literally feel
like a Disney princess wearing this hair
cell and it was actually not that hard
to do granted this hair cell may be a
little bit longer than the previous one
but us only because there's like three
Braves involved but it's totally worth
it and it's still really easy to do but
now I'm going to be multi hair cells
right now for hair so sorry what you
want to do is take two chunks of hair
once again from the front of your face
and just leave these out now with the
rest of the hair what you want to do is
just take it up and gather it up into
quite a high ponytail like your hair is
my seat secure that you want to take
care of these two parts of the hair
which we're going to once again and
braid into regular braid now once your
braids are finally secured you can then
take them towards the back of the
ponytail and kind of integrate the
braids into the ponytail so this is
pretty much the finished hairstyle and
to really finish this off what you can
do is actually take a strand out of the
ponytail and just wrap this around a few
times to conceal the actual hair tie
this will make it a really nice and like
bohemian which I really love and this is
the finished hairstyle I absolutely love
it I think it's so cute the fact that
you have like a little bit of detailing
to really spice up a regular ponytail
and this is super wearable for every
single day well this next pestle I'm
going to be gathering up all of my hair
into a high ponytail I'll let my hair is
nicely secured I'm going to take a clear
elastic tie line bit and I'm going to
tie this portion of my hair right here
once I have tied about section up I'm
going to create a little hole through
and I'm going to loop the whole ponytail
through that hole like so and yes you
guys have guessed it I'm going to be
doing the same thing once again all the
way until I get to the very bottom of
the ponytail and that is literally it
this is one of the easiest hair cells I
probably ever showed you guys how to do
on this channel and I absolutely love it
this creates like a really nice faux
fishtail effect to the head but without
actually having to be able to do a
fishtail braid with next hair cell is
that one of my go-to for every single
day it's just a really easy way to get
your hair out of your face what you want
to do is take at the top chunk of your
hair and just basically put this up into
a ponytail so you couldn't leave your
hair just like this because I think this
is a really cute hairstyle on its own
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take this ponytail and just twist it and
wrap it up into a bun and this is the
finished hairstyle I absolutely love
this one it's so easy and quick to do
and it has been very popular in trendy
over the last year or so so I really
really like having a gradient for the
very last ten so what you want to do is
take a two chunks of hair from the top
of your head and take them to the back
and secure them up with a clear elastic
tie next what you want to do is take
that ponytail and start braiding it with
a regular braid but what you want to do
is actually take it to a larger chunks
and then the middle chunks you want to
leave a quite thin this is going to
create quite a regular braid which you
can then pull out and it will be quite
an even which is the look that we're
going for so they've got all of my
heatless hairstyles for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed them let me know
down below which one with your favorite
out of all of them I think that my
favorite is definitely the first one

it's literally just like my go-to I love
