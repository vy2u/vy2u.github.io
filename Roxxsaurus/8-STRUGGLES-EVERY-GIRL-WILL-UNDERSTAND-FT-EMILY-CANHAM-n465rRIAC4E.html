today I am joined by special gas highs I
only kind of must come to join me on my
channel again and today we're going to
be talking about some go struggles
aren't we yes we are that we all deal
with oh yes obviously these girl
struggles can also some of them can
relate to boys obviously not the period
no you don't have to deal with them this
video is actually in collaboration with
prime video and the show called the bold
type which I've been loving recently you
actually introduced it to Mia and oh my
gosh it's so good so it makes you guys
check it out I'll link here in the
description you guys are gonna love it
so without further ado let's get on into
the video the first drug that gonna talk
about is liking someone but not having
the confidence to tell them yeah so I
don't want to spoil the show for you
guys too much but one of the main
characters has a crush on someone and is
really too scared to tell them but when
they're finally ready it's like too late
now it's a struggle definitely and
especially in your teenage years when
relations I mean like I've been through
that yes I'm pretty sure a lot of us
have yeah so that's definitely a big big
struggle Roxy oh okay hey how are you
just put I'm good how are you okay hey
how are you what a carpet right away I
can't wait give it a few okay we'll go
fur oh hey keep it cool I'm great yeah
no kisses though no no no okay
okay I'm great it's my face yeah uh how
are you yeah yes how are you or how are
you doing yeah okay cool
no that sounds like Joey from France but
how are you
yeah perfect yeah sure yes and I feel
like this is definitely something we've
all been through I know this has
happened to me and I mean it generally
ends up like that we'd like we're
friends having them or you know finally
getting the guts it's too late
embarrassing as well your friends to
tell them yeah you just you gotta be
confident just go for it because you
never know how they're gonna react and
it may be exactly what you want
obviously the name song we have to
mention is periods everyone goes through
this struggle now I know there's a ton
of girls that they don't have period
pains anything like their peers are a
breeze god I would love to be like babe
we're not on my period
it's eat food we're copy clothes chill
out no these are good out the window
definitely such a struggle okay so for
tonight these jeans in this top to
casual just a bit yeah I like the jeans
on top kind of thing that was but have
you got a little bit more like yeah like
that's cute this go white jeans I mean
if you want to you go for it but you do
anything about anything else all night
and I'm not gonna follow you around
living your bum the hot tar okay another
go struggled that a lot of us deal with
is wearing uncomfortable underwear oh
yeah oh my god so when you're wearing
like a tight-fitting dress or trousers
you obviously don't want like underwear
I know so you have to wear a thong and
let me tell you if anyone tells you that
is like comfortable to wear a thong
they are yeah is not but you don't want
like visible lines on you teamlack a
thong is kind of like a floss think it's
five okay sure
we'll make it and I'm pretty sure you
can see my pants are you see right I
should have won real clothes and nice
pants but they're so comfortable I mean
I'm gonna be late but you got okay just
don't come up bar scenario happens to
restore it I just want to whack you
underwear and feel good about myself
and then the next role go is kind of
more of a serious topic and that's not
feeling good enough so in the show
there's a main character who wants to
prove themselves more and have a little
bit more to their name than just like
superficial qualities feel like we all
go through that definitely I know I have
personally and I feel like the pressure
of social media doesn't help at all in
fact I mean you compare yourself to all
these people online and it's hard not to
yeah definitely but it's just that
self-confidence thing and I think
definitely that comes with age and we're
all the experiences you go through but
it's definitely a struggle yeah and you
have to like learn to love yourself and
kind of block out all of the false
expectations off of social media or my
husband to say yeah yes definitely
because like you look at our instagrams
and think oh they're things have a happy
perfect people who have nothing wrong in
their lives then we go through stuff
definitely yes not everyone is gonna
show that side of their life on social
media so you always have to think
there's probably something else going on
behind the scenes that you may not know
about going about something a bit more
lighthearted yeah does this happen to
you getting your sunglasses stuck in
your hand yeah this happens to me every
single time I wear sunless and do you
know when it's been worse when you have
your hair up oh my god lit she can't get
out and off the time when you're trying
to like wiggle the sunglasses out your
hair I end up with like half the amount
of hair I had to be able it pull the
strands out let your ponytail and stuff
like that it's so frustrating it just
ruins your hairstyle Roxy they
no we're look so cute on you take a
picture thank you thank you wait can you
send me that yeah wanna go get some
lunch now
yeah wait Oh
every single time let me tell you guys
eyeliner is one of those things you
definitely have to like master with
practice but even if you've got it down
there's definitely bound to be some days
where you still get it wrong yeah and if
you have like your eyeliner drying up or
something it's like things can happen
and it just makes things not work and
there's no explanation why all right
team let's go for a thin wing today we
can do it we can do it yes that's
perfect
okay now for the other one always wrong
with me I can never do my left eye oh
that is horrendous maybe if I make this
one a little bit bigger
okay scrap the thin wing idea that's
been a bit more daring today one is
longer than the other oh no this is just
not going to plan I'm still so terrible
at this like I wear makeup all the time
I practice all the time you nailed your
wing I don't know how you do it
basically I start with the wing first
and then I kind of just like feed it
into the rest of my Iife okay easy yes
so it's like balance out but yeah I need
to try that the girl struggled that is
probably one of the main ones for me is
smudging my nail polish I am horrific a
penny goes and you ever need like to go
for a we immediately
oh no every single time
look at it wait this is why I shouldn't
make my nose you can't even salvage that
longer most frustrating go struggle for
me is having that kink in your hair
after you wear a ponytail yes and if you
use like a bobble that's not tight
enough your hair just falls out but you
don't get the kinks it's like do you go
for like the messy ponytails it's hard
way down your head or do you go for a
kink in your hair there's no in-between
Roxy finished up my hair up or down
tonight Oh down definitely yeah look
best alone and I feel like I look super
casual if I have it open it won't look
right there is that like a proper kick
yeah right oh that's gonna take too long
I'm actually back up so those are all of
our girl struggles that we struggle the
most weird yeah let us know some of your
go struggles down below and also let us
know if you do struggle with any of
these yeah definitely and also don't
forget to check out the show that we've
been watching which is called the bow
type as well as a head over to Emily's
