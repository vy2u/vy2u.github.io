channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far so today's video is
going to be slightly weird now I said a
few weird videos on this channel but
this could be one of the most weird ones
that I've done so basically in today's
video I am going to be taking the
challenge of applying a full face of
makeup using no makeup but food and I'm
going to turn that into using food to
actually apply my normal makeup so
instead of brushes instead of Beauty
blenders I'm just going to be using food
items oh why am i doing this to myself
have no idea how this is going to go
down that this video is not serious if
you guys can tell it's just a bit of fun
just so that the challenge I wanted to
do if you guys enjoyed watching me apply
makeup with a bunch of food then give
this video a thumbs up and also
subscribe if you haven't already because
I would love to have you here come and
join the dinosaur family or whatever ado
let's get on with this video and let
smear a bunch of food on my face so the
first thing I'm going to be using to
apply my foundation is Mary Kay so I
actually originally wanted to use a
Victoria sponge cake because it's like a
sponge do you guys get it like a beauty
sponge but I felt now that's just really
wasteful so I actually bought a pack of
12 fairy cakes I'm going to eat the rest
don't you worry but I will be using one
of them to apply at my foundation mmm
that's good it's only your Beauty
Blender with edible that would be pretty
good but back into the video let's
actually apply my foundation with this
fairy cake this is just a recipe for
disaster let's be honest I'm gonna apply
a little bit on to the fairy cake this
is so wrong
I hope I don't get like weird cake
residue on my face okay let's go oh gosh
this is not a good start already could
be like starting a new Instagram trends
instead of using a Beauty Blender you
can use a fairy cake
Philip repeats a pretty good item to
apply my foundation with because I feel
like this will be able to blend out my
makeup quite well and it smells good and
if edible so win-win pay the so far kind
of leaving like the texture of the cake
on my skin but I thought it would be wet
I'm not gonna lie it's kind of difficult
to get into like these areas of my face
where like I can't really get it so I'm
just going to have to like take the cake
out of the absol package insert
oh no it's like crumbling in my hands
dude I actually I'm not even gonna lie
that's blended my foundation perceivable
this is the new silly sponge the fairy
sponge if I crap I've got a bit of fairy
cake on my face now guys this is the
foundation guys actually a pretty good
job okay so next up is of course contour
so for contouring i'm going to be
fitting a banana yeah a banana
so why thought to do it recipes the
banana as like a guideline perhaps for
the contour and use a cream contour
stick which is the maybelline one and
i'm going to blend this in with another
food item oh my god I just remembered
that I actually bought some eggs
specifically for this video because I
don't actually eat eggs very often and I
was going to actually use a hard-boiled
egg to blend white foundation outwards
because it almost be like a Beauty
Blender and I completely forgot about it
so I just used the fairy sponge get away
that's probably for the best
anyways because my face was it's not
like an egg so to blend out the
guideline of the banana I'm actually
going to be using a broccoli the reason
why I chose a broccoli is because I felt
like again it's quite a spongy texture
surfaces
I don't think I'm going to work but
let's see okay so I'm going to break off
one of the little broccoli
thingies and this is going to be my
beauty blender okay so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to apply my contour onto
the banana this is not going to be very
easy I do not think okay I feel like
that is enough product so I'm just going
to press this onto my cheekbone
oh yes it works this is definitely the
weirdest thing I've ever done with a
food and then I'm going to repeat the
same thing to the other side Bay um look
at that contour and now that my contour
is in place we can now blend this bad
boy out with some broccoli as you do
very casual just another day in the
office no that's actually doing quite a
good job oh my god this is actually
insane who never using a Beauty Blender
again it's going to even this broccoli
from a surprise smells so good I also do
you love broccoli fun fact
broccoli is actually my favorite
vegetable ever oh my god I have actually
contour my face successfully with a
broccoli
can we just okay so now moving on to
blush I'm actually going to be using a
peach original lighter is a peach to
apply my blush is because it's very soft
and it has like a fuzzy peachy kind of
texture and I feel like it would be
quite good to apply blush and to go with
the theme I'm going to be using the
coralista blush from my little benefit
set there we go
I'm just gonna blend that in into my
cheek so far so good oh my god I can't
believe this it's actually blend it out
so easy what the hell I'm also using
that same at peach to apply my highlight
to the one I'm using is from Tarte and
this is called the xposed Amazonian clay
highlighter so again I'm just gonna dab
my teach it into the product and by the
way I've washed everything before I
started
so don't think like it's unsanitary or
anything because I washed everything
okay so it's on my peach and now just
going to apply this to my cheekbone it's
really weird to say but using a peach to
apply anything on your face action feels
surprisingly nice because it's like
quite bouncy into sauce okay even though
everything was going super well and up
to this point my makeup looks actually
presentable
I'm pretty sure it's all going to go
downhill now because I'm going to be
using an asparagus as a blending brush
to apply my eyeshadow presenter you know
gonna go well this will feel so wrong
I'm going to be taking this brown
eyeshadow here on my afar go this is
gonna go so wrong
oh my god it made it really pigmented
it's a little bit wet oh no oh no I told
you I told you guys this was going well
up until this point
look at that fallout oh no it's not
looking that bad it could look worse and
maliciously rubbing an asparagus on my
eyes pear this video has given
vegetarians a whole new meaning
I'm gonna do the bottom lash line and
approach to God that I don't poke myself
in the eye okay so I'm now going to take
this gold eyeshadow which is actually a
highlighter and again on the same brush
I'm just going to be picking that up on
the brush on the same asparagus rather
I'm going to be picking up I'm going to
be applying this to the very center of
my lid Chiqui inner corner highlight
because why not okay so my eyeshadow is
actually not too bad I'm now going to
move on to the eyeliner and this is
definitely where it's going to go wrong
don't you worry guys you are going to
see me fail in this video at some point
and this is probably the stage where
this is going to happen
I'm going to be using a snap peas a
sugar snaps snappy that what of course I
snappy I'm gonna be using this to apply
my eyeliner and also my brows so let's
see how I guess so the reason why I
picked a sugar snap to apply my eyeliner
is because it's actually quite sharp on
the end and I feel like I'll be able to
get quite a precise wing within my
winged liner on there now let's see if
this works
oh my god
how is this laughing oh and it's dry go
apply some more because it dries pretty
quick with this one I'm not really good
at doing my other eyeliner on the site
as it is so this is going to be quite
interesting try to apply it with a
snappy I feel like that I came out even
better what the heck by no means is it
nice that I would actually feel like oh
yeah that's like a good eyeliner but I
feel like ass okay like I would actually
go out with this eyeliner right now so
the only makeup products actually can
substitute with a fruit product is
mascara let me know down below if you
guys have any suggestions what I could
have applied mascara with because I
couldn't find anything that I would have
thought would be suitable enough so
unless you're just going to apply
mascara with the original wand so guys
my eye makeup is now finished and I'm
actually so pleasantly surprised with
how it turns out I literally cannot
believe it
but I'm now going to move on to my
eyebrows and for this I'm also going to
be using a snap pea so I'm going to be
using my Anastasia dip pomade and
literally just dipping the snap pea
right in there
oh my god this actually works for well
I'm just constantly surprising myself
with how well this is working it's not
bad not bad at all now lastly to finish
off this look I'm going to be applying
my lipstick with relevance and oh my
gosh I just realized I so should have
used this for my eyeliner this would
have been perfect for my eyeliner the
mystic I'm going to be using today is my
Maybelline lipstick from my Maybelline
collection this is the shade vivid vixen
if you guys haven't checked out my like
announcement video I'll leave it down
below so you guys can see all of the
different lipsticks from my range which
are sold in Superdrug if you guys are
interested and the packaging of this is
actually something I've designed myself
which is really really cool for me this
is going to be so weird
well this is the finished look guys I am
literally shook I was able to do a
pretty much my everyday look and it
looks good you would never be able to
tell that I use food to actually apply
my makeup when I first told this idea I
thought it would be an absolute disaster
so to see this look come together
I'm actually like shook like why have I
been using makeup brushes this whole
something I'm just kidding I'm just
kidding I feel like this is something
that's quite fun to do but as long as
you're not wasting tons and tons of food
because obviously that's bad so I would
never want to do that but yeah it's just
funny how this is like the look that I
created with food I would love for you
guys to let me know down below what you
thought of this like challenge this will
be really awesome just became a
challenge and I would love to see your
recreations if you did decide to do this
like with your friends just as as like a
fun thing to do one night I don't know
so that is all for this video I have so
much fun filming this please don't take
this video too seriously I just thought
I do like a challenge video every now
and again so yeah I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
you smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and also don't forget to subscribe
I would love to have you here come and
join the dinosaur family but that is all

wonderful day and I'll see you very soon
