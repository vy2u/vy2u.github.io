today I'm gonna be filming get ready
with me slash makeup tutorial kind of
thing on this look right here this is
the perfect look for auto oh my god I
just love this look so much and I hope
you guys like it too I'm gettin quickly
address the elephant in the room
I do have different hair I basically
wanted to change up my hair a little bit
for autumn because I just cannot be
bothered to keep up with my room it's
like you guys always tell me that my
roots are so long so I just decided to
pretty much fade them out and let it
kind of grow out into an ombre so today
I'm gonna be filming and this look right
here it's very like autumnal very red
and I'm gonna be using a bunch of my
favorite Maybelline products for this so
it's gonna be like a one branded
drugstore makeup tutorial so everyone
can do this because Maybelline products
are so affordable but they're so amazing
so this is the like if you guys want to
see how to achieve it then let's get on
into the video okay so to staff the look
I'm gonna apply some foundation on first
and the foundation of my BZ today is the
super stay 24 hour full coverage
foundation now this is actually a brand
new foundation that has just been
released on the shafts and I literally
am in love with their life I cannot
explain to you guys how good this is the
reason why I love this foundation so
much is because the consistency is quite
a watery one which makes it so easy to
blend into the skin but whilst being
quite watery and fluid it's also really
high in coverage I would say this
foundation is quite a medium coverage
which is perfect for my complexion
but me it's just enough to cover up the
dark circles and you know any blemishes
that I may have in my skin but I'm just
gonna start blending this out into my
skin and honestly this blends so easily
once you blend this out it honestly
looks like part of your skin and not
like makeup which is exactly what you
want in a foundation so I absolutely
love this one and would definitely
recommend for you guys to try it out I'm
moving on to concealer to cover up my
dark circles and any blemishes on my
skin I'm gonna be using the Dream Lumi
touch highlighting concealer by
Maybelline it's really lightweight so it
personally does increase for me
underneath the eye and I honestly swear
by this concealer there was
my face I'm just gonna blend this out
with my ring finger because I feel like
the warmth from my hand really melts the
product into my skin so for contouring
today I'm gonna be using the master
scoped contouring palette and this is in
shade medium to dark 0-2 so I'm just
gonna be taking the contouring bronzer
from this onto a flat top brush and I'm
just gonna pop that into the hollows of
my cheek bones as I usually do this is
one of my favorite drugstore bronzers
just because it's so cool toned and it
really looks so natural on the skin as
you can see that looks really natural
and literally looks like the shadows of
my face rather than makeup I'm also
gonna blend this into the temple and up
to my forehead just to get that overall
bronzed look so now that I'm all
contoured the last step over the skin is
off course at the highlighter and today
I'm so excited because I actually get to
use a highlighter that hasn't been
released in the UK just yet oh this is
it it's the master chrome highlighter
from Maybelline and this is actually
already out in the US which is why I
have got my hands on it but it is coming
out in the UK in January and oh my god
it's just so beautiful like look at that
just can we judge this is so beautiful
it's so pigmented would you just look at
that this highlight is literally perfect
like look at the pigmentation it's so
blinding and it's perfect for autumn
this shade of highlight is gonna be so
hot for autumn and fall so I'm just so
excited that this is coming out soon and
you guys can get your hands on it as
well look how amazing this highlight
legs it's so freakin blinding okay so
moving on to the eyes I am so excited
for this because I'm gonna be
introducing you guys to a brand new at
palette now this is called the burgundy
bar I'm sure you guys have seen this
like in the drugstore on the maybelline
stand this palette is insane I wore this
to Coachella last year and I was so
excited for this palette to come into
production in the UK because obviously
it was launched first in America the
palette is just beautiful like the
colors are perfect and they're perfect
for autumn so if you guys haven't tried
this palette yet you totally should
because the colors are just so wearable
and there
so highly pigmented so first I'm gonna
take this light brown shade and use this
as a transition shadow this is going to
act as the base of our eyeshadow look
and it's really going to help us blend
all of the colors into it because this
will be quite a dark eyeshadow look the
next shot I'm gonna use is the red one
of this palette now this shadow is so
pretty like I love this shadow it's one
of my favorites in this palette and
again I'm just gonna take a tiny bit of
that shadow and just pop this through
the crease just to add a little bit of
color and warmth through that you want
to blend out this shadow a really super
well into the crease so that it has no
like harsh lines and it all blends in
seamlessly next I'm gonna take a
different brush I'm taking this a little
pencil brush for a bit more precision
and I'm taking that same red shadow and
just popping that into the crease line
because we're gonna be actually creating
a little bit of a cut crease today I
feel like this is such a pretty look for
autumn so that's what I'm gonna go for
today you just really want to intensify
that red color just through the crease
so once it looks something like this I'm
now going to take the darkest shadow of
the palette which is a matte Brown
shadow and with the same a pencil brush
I'm just gonna pop that through the
crease once again just deepening up that
crease and making that red even darker
so once you get to this sort of stage
you want to really clean it up with a
concealer so the one that I'm going to
be using today is the brow precise
perfecting highlighter so this is to
carve out the shape of your brows but
you can also use this as a eyelid kind
of primer or concealer so I'm literally
just gonna take that and apply this to
the lid and really carve out the shape
of my cut crease so this is what the cut
crease it should look like I've kind of
made it quite high up because we're
actually going to be doing a winged
liner underneath it but now I'm just
gonna move in to the other eye and
repeat the same thing I'm also just
going to take that red eye shadow just
underneath my eye and blending it into
the lower lash line I'm actually gonna
extend the lower lash line
all the way out to kind of meet
the other like higher cut crease I'm not
very good at explaining but this is
basically what you want to do all my
eyeliner I'm actually going to be using
a gel liner today and now the one I'm
using is this one here and this is in
shade charcoal so what we want to do
here is literally just line this bottom
a red line right here and connect it out
onto the eye now moving onto a mascara
I'm gonna be using it this one right
here which is the lash sensational this
one comes in a really cute rose gold
packaging and yeah I just love it so I'm
just gonna apply this to the top and
bottom lashes and now to finish off the
leg I'm gonna be using at the new super
stay matte in in shade a 50 this is such
a pretty burgundy color and it's gonna
be perfect for this look and this is the
finished makeup look I absolutely love
this look so much it is literally
perfect for autumn and I can tell that
I'm gonna be wearing this so much
throughout the month I have to say the
favorite part of this look is the
lipstick I mean come on let's just look
at it it's just such a pretty color and
I actually wore this lipstick too at
London Fashion Week and I literally had
it on all day I was eating drinking and
it did not budge it was still looking
like this at the end of the day which I
was like no way let me know down below
