channel so in today's video as you can
see by the title today we're gonna be
doing kind of like her monthly favorites
sort of video I literally never do these
on my channel I'm not really too sure
why but let me know if you guys do enjoy
favorites videos below in the comments
and maybe I'll do more in the future but
today I thought I would kind of do like
my Beauty favorites of the month and
these are just products that I literally
cannot live without like once I have
tried them I was hooked from the first
moment so I'm really excited to share
them with you guys if you guys would
like to see more videos like this in the
future do give this video a thumbs up
and also subscribe down below but
without further ado let's get on into
the video so for my first at favorites
product you guys know that I love trying
new hair products all the time like
shampoos conditioners a whole lot just
because my hair is quite damaged from
bleaching err and you know I really need
all the help that I can get so the first
product that I've been loving recently
is the Coco and Yves like a virgin hair
mask so this says it's a super
nourishing coconut in thicker hair mask
it has a virgin coconut insider and it
also comes with a little brush that you
can use to you know brush out your hair
after you've applied the conditioner
which I realized this smells absolutely
divine so if you guys love the smell of
coconut you all really like this so
since I've been using this hair mask I
have seen the biggest difference in my
hair like my hair is so much softer it
doesn't feel like hay and obviously
because this is a hair mask it's just
really hydrating to my hair I like to
apply this maybe like twice a week and I
honestly see the biggest difference
although this is super hydrating I feel
like it's one of those hair masks that
doesn't really weigh down your hair but
it's super hydrating so yeah I would
highly recommend for you guys to try
this out because obviously like it's
called like a virgin it restores your
hair to its virgin state and it really
really makes a difference next time I'm
going to move into makeup so at the
first and makeup favorites that I have
had this month which is kind of like a
recent one is this now this is the
backtalk urban decay palette I'm pretty
sure this has recently dropped in the UK
either she got it in the post like only
a couple of days ago but I'm really
really liking it already so basically
the palette looks like this it comes up
with a blush and highlighter side and
also a mirror inside that you can take
out like so and
it's basically just like an eyeshadow
and a blush palette all-in-one which is
just amazing for traveling I think these
shades are absolutely gorgeous I am
gonna get so much use out of them so yes
this is the all-in-one backtalk palette
I absolutely love it the shades are
absolutely gorgeous they're so creamy
and pigmented like every Urban Decay
palette so I am really really liking
this you guys should definitely check
this out if you're like a lover of Urban
Decay eyeshadows now the next makeup
product I have been totally obsessed
with is this little bad boy I don't know
if you guys can see from afar but this
is the new L'Oreal glow glow Mon Armour
I think that's how you say it I'm not
too sure so this is basically the
highlighting that drops from L'Oreal
this is their new range and I absolutely
love this it's so inexpensive this is
such a versatile highlighter because
obviously you can mix it into your
foundation but you can use it as like an
actual highlighted glow let me just
apply it a little bit more I'm wearing
it right now on my cheeks but look at
that that is just insane right let's
just quickly blend that in but this is
honestly so good like it's so easy to
blend it just melts into the skin and
it's really inexpensive because it's
obviously from the drugstore so I have
been loving this I feel like this is
definitely gonna be one of my summer
essentials that for this year because
it's just such a versatile little
product you can wear it on like your
collarbones on your body on your face
literally everywhere and just look how
pigmented it is I mean look at that
now the next two products are kind of
like a lip combo that I have been
sporting throughout like the last three
months to be honest so the first product
is this which is the cappuccino a Rimmel
lip liner you guys know that I am a firm
lover of this product I've been using it
for honestly like years to be honest
because it's just such a beautiful color
you guys won't be able to see from afar
but it's just so versatile for like so
many different skin tones I just feel
like it's so creamy like the formulas
really good definitely definitely
recommend this as like a really good
drugstore lip liner and also I find that
this is one of the best lip liners to
kind of like over line with a little bit
but still make it look natural so if
you're one of those people that likes to
over line their lips definitely try this
and with the lip pencil I've also been
using at this
to liquid lipstick pretty much every
single day now this is a little bit on
the pricey side but it honestly lasts
for ages as it is from lyocell so this
is cooler what is this actually called
it's called the tattoo wash Couture
matte stain and it's in shade Shino but
it's like the nude one so I'm sure you
guys will be able to find it I'll link
it down below anyways but the reason why
I really like this is well the
applicator is like really really precise
so you can really easily apply this but
also it's so like hydrating but it stays
matte like I'm actually wearing it on my
lips right now you probably would think
that I'm wearing like a matte lipstick
or something but I'm really not I'm
wearing this and it's like a stain so it
doesn't really come off but it doesn't
really leave your lips like really
crackly and like a little bit gross you
know sometimes when you're wearing like
a liquid lipstick for super long your
lips get so dry so this product is
honestly perfect if you want to get that
matte look but you don't want your lips
to look like a Sahara Desert so yes that
is the little lip combo that I've been
using for the past few months and
honestly at these products are the best
now the next makeup product that I have
been loving recently is this this is the
benefit bad girl bang mascara and
honestly this has changed my game
honestly like I cannot express how much
I love this mascara I remember when this
came out there was a little bit of like
tea around the product some people said
it was really good some people didn't
really like it but honestly I have to
say it is one of the best mascara I have
actually used from benefit and just in
general like it is one of the best
mascara as I have ever used again it is
a lil bow on the pricey side it's not
like your drugstore typical prices but
it is so worth it and I've had this open
for like a couple of months and honestly
it hasn't even dried out yet which is
really good this just makes my lashes so
like well like I just love it like it
makes my lashes look so long so I would
a hundred percent recommend for you guys
to give this a shot next up I have a
little skincare favorite I actually have
quite a few skincare favorites this
month so basically the first one is this
this is the Nivea micellar
missile err skin breathe missile of
water so this is for the eyes lips and
face and it comes in such a big bottle
but it literally lasts you forever so
you guys know from my Instagram I love
this product so much like it just
removes everything like at the end of
the night there's like no residue
literally one of the best missile of
waters I have ever used and it's so
gentle on the skin you guys just know
how I feel about Nivea I've been using
it Nivea for like years since I was a
kid my mom used to use it on me so yeah
to find like a really good micellar
water that can remove all my makeup is
definitely a big win for me
the next product I have is this now this
is a new Maybelline tattoo brow Micro
pen this has recently come out in the UK
and is quickly become one of my faves as
well so the reason why it's a little bit
different from your usual like regular
eyebrow pencils is because the actual
applicator is like a little fork it's
super strange but basically what you do
is you kind of just brush it along
sideways and it creates a hair like
strokes on your eyebrows so if you guys
want to get that like faded brow it's
like a little bit fluffy with some fake
hairs at the front of the brow then this
product oh my god it's so good it's
honestly really really simple to use as
well so I would 100% recommend for you
guys to try it the next product I have
is another skincare favorite this is the
being of by sanctuary spa chili mango
and tonka bean body lotion it comes in
like pretty big hefty size and they also
do like hand cream sprays all sorts it
smells absolutely amazing like I love to
just use this on my hands on my elbows
that everywhere
it smells so good if you guys ever go to
like superdrug or boots I think they
have it in both or maybe they just have
it in Boots you guys need to like smell
this try it it's honestly the best this
just leaves your skin is so hydrated and
especially now in the summer like your
skin can get a little bit dry from like
the Sun so definitely give this a shot
and try it out for yourself
I then have another skincare favorites
now this has been like an ongoing
favorites for like my whole teenage life
and this is it so this is the Mario
Badescu drying lotion I have spoken
about this on my channel before and
honestly it's just like one of the best
spa treatments you ever find out there
so it's actually like a 2/5
type of deal so it's got like the powder
at the bottom and then like the liquid
at the top so what you do with this is
you literally just dip your like cotton
bud in there and then directly dab it
onto like a spot even if it hasn't
surfaced yet and you can like kind of
feel that you're gonna get a spot like
on your chin or literally anywhere on
your face you can just go ahead and pop
this on and it will prevent it from like
getting any bigger getting more inflamed
or like kind of stuff and this no she
just dries out your spots overnight so
if you struggle with acne or just spots
in general do give this a shot I think
it retails for roughly twenty pounds but
I'll link it down below but it's
honestly so good it lasts you like years
like I have had this one since Christmas
I've used it so much and it's barely
gone down so honestly it's such a good
investment so yeah if you struggle with
like the occasional sports or even acne
do give this a shot my next favorite is
actually a scent so this is a a Viktor
and Rolf perfume this is the flower bomb
perfume I absolutely love the bottle
I've had this for a little while now and
I have kind of used half of it already
it just smells so good if you're
anything like me and you love like
floral but sweet and fruity scents then
this is just gonna be perfect for you if
you ever go down to like a perfume shop
do you give this a smell cuz honestly it
just smells so nice and I just feel like
this is one of those perfumes that
everyone would like like no matter wha
you will like this we are now coming
very close to the end of the video I
have two products left so the first one
is the incredible you glow girl face
like iridescent jelly I don't know what
this is called but basically it's kind
of like a highlighter slash eyeshadow
you can do anything with this to be
honest but the reason why I really like
this is because the texture is kind of
like a jelly putty sort of thing and you
guys know I love trying weird products
like this all the time so when I saw
this I was like okay I need to give this
a shot and honestly it is one of the
most beautiful colors I have ever seen I
don't know if you guys can see that but
it's such a pretty highlight like you
can obviously use this on your lids for
like a wet look or you can use it on
your cheekbones as a highlight it's such
a versatile product and you do get quite
a lot of it in the pan as well so I have
been really really liking this as like a
highlight recently and the very last
product of my favorites which I've
literally been living for
is this you guys probably have seen this
a thousand times on social media it's
such a big product it's from Mac it's
the prep and prime fix plus pink light
setting spray this honestly looks so
weird inside the bottle because it's
like all bubbly and it's also got like a
slight of like pink glow to it so I
have been using this so much recently
especially now that like the Sun is
coming out in the UK it's summertime my
makeup is literally just melting
straight off so I definitely have been
needing some kind of product to keep my
makeup on all day and that is exactly
why I've been loving this this really
nicely refreshes your makeup it makes it
look less like dry and cakey but it also
sets it at the same time so definitely
would recommend for you guys to try
there is honestly one of the best
setting sprays I have ever used to be
honest and I have gone through so many
bottles of this already because it's
just so good and I can't stop using it
so that is everything for my monthly
favorites this has been every single
product that I literally feel like I
can't live without at the moment like
it's all the products that I have tried
and tested over the past like few months
and honestly I'm really really excited
that I get to share them with you guys
and you guys can try them out for
yourself and see if you like them I will
have all of the links for everything I
have mentioned in this video in the
description so make sure you guys that
check them out if you guys would like to
see more videos like this in the future
do let me know by giving this video a
thumbs up and also let me know in the
comments I've actually had fun filming
this video so yeah I would definitely
like to do more in the future if you
guys find them helpful but anyways that
is all from me thank you so much for

wonderful day and I'll see you guys in
