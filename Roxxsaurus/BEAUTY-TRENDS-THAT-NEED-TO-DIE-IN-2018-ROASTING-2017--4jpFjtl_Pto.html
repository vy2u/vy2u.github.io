today is officially the last day of 2017
which is honestly crazy I feel like I've
blinked and the whole year has just
flown by I've had a really amazing year
some of the highlights have been at
getting 2 million subscribers on this
channel which is absolutely incredible
and I've had lots of chances to meet you
guys it's like summer in the city and
other events which has been like the
best part of YouTube so far for me and I
also had the amazing opportunity to have
my own range of limited lipsticks with
Maybelline in super drive I still can't
get over that opportunity it's probably
like the coolest thing I've ever done
but to end this year with a bag I
thought what better way to do it then
with a recap slash review of the most
crazy trends online has been some pretty
wacky ones this year and I actually
asked you guys on Twitter what are the
worst trends that you think should die
in 2018 and you guys will come up with a
huge list of the trends that we should
probably leave behind in 2017 I just
want to put out there that I obviously
don't mean this video to offend anyone
I'm not doing this to be like you can't
do this you can't do that of course
there's going to be some things that you
guys may like from this video hey I mean
I'm actually kind of guilty of doing
some of these things and myself so this
video is not to tell you what to do you
do you girlfriend do whatever makes you
happy as always but without the rule do
let's get on into the video okay so
there has been a big amount of tweets
about this first trend I'm gonna talk
about and I mean a lot of you guys
guessed it it's the feather brass I
think this trend was born on the
Instagram as many things are these days
so when I first saw this trend I was
just kind of scrolling casually through
Instagram as we do and I saw this at
first I thought that they had a very bad
plucking accident but I soon came to the
realization that they did this not by
accident but on purpose I mean the
further browse may look cool in high
fashion but in real life it just kind of
looks like your cousin or your uncle has
come up to you and given your eyebrows a
good or rub as they do on your head I
think that's good enough I'm not too
sure when someone does this to your head
but it looks like they did it to your
eyebrows the next trend according to you
guys that needs to go in 2018
is the braided browse now I actually
kind of like this one because I feel
like it's quite creative but a lot of
people think that they actually braided
their brow like use tweezers or
something I have no idea like if that's
even possible to braid your brows
probably isn't but this is definitely a
Photoshop kind of trend I mean can you
imagine spending there like hours with
like tweezers trying to raise your
eyebrows now I'm noting that these brow
friends are like serious or to be taken
seriously I know that they're a bit of a
joke but still it needs to go and the
last brow trend slash general makeup
because people have done full faces of
this as well is the wavy makeup trend I
mean I honestly don't know where this
came from who thought this idea like it
does not look good and I don't really
know what kind of purpose it serves but
people have actually been doing this
this year it's just very weird to see
but according to you guys it's also got
to go now the next trend is probably my
favorite and when I say favorite it's
the worst friend ever that's why it's my
favorite and that is the nose hair
extensions people have put fake lashes
in their nostrils this year I actually
quite like to try the trend so I've got
an eyelash right here I'm just gonna
curl it up into a ball
this just feels so wrong I'm about to
insert an eyelash into my nostril what
the heck why would you do this it
literally looks like an old man's nose
that he hasn't trimmed for 50 years so
that is it that is the nose hair
extensions feel internets I think this
is the best I have ever looked
it's very tickly I'm gonna sneeze on it
oh my god it's actually stayed in as in
obviously I'm not gonna use these now
guys I should feel a fella kind of win
without hair in my nose now I kind of
got used to it silly sponges they have
been quite the invention this year and
naturally because
as a human race with so clever and
brilliant that we thought instead of
getting the study sponge let's just wrap
a Beautyblender in a condom I mean do I
need to say anything else about this
this is probably the most ridiculous
trend I have ever seen this year like no
just get a silly sponge it's like 2
pounds ok so this next friend I'm
actually guilty of doing myself
don't judge me guys but that is the full
charcoal body peel if you guys haven't
seen my full charcoal body peel boy have
you missed out it was filled with pain
just utter failure it's a trend that we
definitely need to leave behind because
it is sorry but bloomin painful I
honestly don't know where this came
about but way too many people did it
this year and I'm just here to tell you
do not repeat it at home because it was
living painful now this next round is a
fashion trend and this one is kind of a
little bit controversial but I want to
know your thoughts on this basically the
trend is at the Gucci fur-lined kind of
like slip-on shoes so the reason I
didn't like them is because not only are
they real fur which means that all day
you're just treading on some poor
skinned ferret which is so gross when
you think about it but also I understand
the style of shoe is that a loafer or is
there a flip-flop it's kind of like
in-between I don't personally like this
style of shoe but let me know what you
guys think of it I've just seen them
everywhere in 2017 and I just feel like
they should they should just be
discontinued it's now obviously I
couldn't do this video without
mentioning one of the biggest like
lifestyle kind of trends of this year
and that's fidget spinners I feel like
it's kind of already died out by itself
it's definitely not as popular as it was
like halfway through this year and I
honestly don't really have anything
against fidget spinners especially when
they're used for what they're actually
designed for and that's to kind of like
distract you or make you feel less
anxious like that kind of thing but I do
feel like they have been so like
overrated this year they've definitely
become a whole lot more mainstream so
those are all of the trends that you
guys have me gather on Twitter that
should be left in 2017 maybe
this video as a little summary of the
year definitely let me know which one of
these trends was like your least
favorite but to kind of switch it up and
leave it on a positive note do you let
me know in the comments which trends was
your favorite of the year it could be
like a trend or a meme I personally
really like the sabe like that was my
favorite of the year I quickly want to
thank you guys for the most amazing year
you guys have given me I'm forever
grateful for all of the support you guys
have given me throughout this year but
both this channel and also my second
channel rocks or his vlogs I just always
been interactive on my social media you
guys have no idea how much it means to
me that I can just like tweet out and so
many of you guys will reply 2017 has
been one of the best years of my life so
far and I really hope you guys had an
amazing year as well but I also hope
that you guys have an even better year
in 2018 again thank you so much for
watching I hope to see guys on the flip
side in 2018 I hope you guys have the
most amazing new years and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
