today I'm joined by a special guest me
by my Tivo my boyfriend and he is back
with another challenge with me what are
you gonna be doing today
so when Roxy was in New York I went to
Primark and I had the best shop of my
life he had a shop I spent a good hour
that a good oh yeah can we go and the
reason I had to leave was cuz the shop
was closing
oh that sounds promising so basically
we're doing outfit challenges right -
yeah yeah
boy your advice girlfriends out that's
the one that's Primark and I've got six
outfits and that's pretty much about I
was enjoying myself I'm very excited to
see what you got for me so should we
have a look let's have a look all right
let's go all right where do we start
I've got a bag atop some jeans okay I'm
ready for anything just give me anything
all right
by the way guys if I sound nasally in
this video it's because I'm very ill so
yeah very ill for quite a while I have
video for so so long and I'm only just
time to recover but I feel like right
first of all you've got some things from
Primark recently and it's not my fault
I bought these items before you did
we're gonna start with the item that I'm
pretty sure you for relief you're hotter
this I know I have Disney but it's got a
life all over it well this is really
cute like a Christmasy jumper I've got
little pugs on it
twelve pounds that's actually sew up my
street I love that yeah this was a bonus
right I was about to check out walk into
the checkout and then I saw this I'm
just like well you're kind of into Harry
Potter so I'll just pick up this I
solemnly swear that I'm up to no good
all those cute I like that so basically
I think the way we're doing this is I'm
just gonna show the clothes and yeah
which are the outfits of them yeah I
guess because like I said some that
makes his imagine yeah that's really
cute how much was this nice and it's
quite oversized and cozy too
yeah like that the next item I'm not
sure if you're gonna like it I like it
and I can't beat you wearing it okay
just kind of water me but you're gonna
judge it straight away
I'll get a chance so it was a shirt I
don't know you don't usually wear these
shoes I like it no I do you like it yeah
I like the color scheme like it's pink
and like kind of nude yes Perry James of
this is I can only kind of show I
usually bought clutch shots that I like
red and stuff and that's kind of why
don't read but I don't know I really
like this suppose downhill from here
this is the pipe I thought you I'm gonna
switch up a little bit okay gonna get
pair of jeans out Oh pair of jeans so
excited to see this the first color is
pretty standard for pair jeans okay yeah
I like jeans like this it's got a nice
time
it's not it's like a Navy kind of jeans
sorry--but isn't it oh it's
superhighways skinny yeah that's good
I love super high-waisted jeans and
prymaat jeans are always the best
so so that's just gonna have with a
couple of the outfit yeah you can tell
you about wear that with the plaid shirt
hmm that was yeah I was thinking that
with a shirt shoes yeah show me more
shoes you girl I've got two pairs of
shoes I'm just gonna get them both out
okay and did you get sighs what did you
get I got your size
what's my size oh my god is fine no way
I actually had I actually got these
shoes I've been writing them in Disney
really see yeah but this is new right I
got them yeah I got this from my bottom
first it was a cute they are cute right
yeah
I reopened it looks like something you'd
get in like Topshop or something right
yeah and how much were they please Oh 16
it seems their prices and these were 12
well that's like pretty affordable to
say they're more like your casual ones I
guess like your smile yeah going out oh
cool nice nice like missing far what
you're next oh yeah hit me over the top
okay I'm gonna get one that I think you
already like yellow yeah yeah yeah so
this is really nice I really like that
color so I would say that's inquit 13
pounds is not bad and it's so soft isn't
it like it's so nice really nice maybe
you want to keep it no I do want to keep
it good I throw away the receipt so I'm
gonna see you running keeping it all
right that brings a song to the last top
ha okay show us what you got
I think you'll like it and expound on
camera so it's nice like it's missing
the shot so a lot of online culture
I mean I don't know yeah that's really
nice actually I like that it's like your
typical like cozy knit jumper just to
throw on obviously you do it like this
that's like the total net motion that's
very nice
you like everything we're gonna get some
things that were like me know my tastes
cause we've done like this challenge
before and then cost it every time but
Jimmy fan he does win every time
whenever it's you versus me like just
like no kind of boring outfit a little
bit cheaper for the safe option to be
fair I think my choice um and this was
30 pounds by the way if you're wondering
just really actually quite affordable it
is
it's good there was actually one thing
left in the bank oh and it's an
accessory which has pretty much all the
outfits okay
it was only two nice that's my cue you
know half right I just thought if I go
for a neutral color it will probably
welcome all the outfit yeah I think so
that's much you did so well you know so
basically with what you bought your
gonna put together an outfit yes six
outfits okay we're gonna show those in a
second let's go okay so this is the
first outfit what do you think it's good
I like it it's very cozy very like
casual the shoes are really like cozy
they're really comfortable to wear so
definitely the jumper is it has a bit
more color to it but the lights kind of
washing it out obviously you have the
same shoes and jeans but the top is
different and I feel like it's really
easy to you know I just dress it up
dress it down this kind of outfits
really cool right I mean the plaid shirt
you're a little bit right like it's not
really my style but I do like it yeah I
think it's quite a nice casual outfit
number two then is now let's move on to
point number three this is outfit number
three and it's definitely the more cozy
one isn't that
that's John poet so like nice and
oversized and this beanie is also giving
me life and the shoes are really cool
too
we went for the white shoes for this one
yeah it's so so cozy and I kept doing it
and this is the next outfit so actually
these trousers Matt forgot to show you
in the hall which are really nice kind
of like a beige you kind of color
they're also high waisted so perfect and
then he paired it with this job here
which obviously I love like I said in
the video and it's very nice and cozy
and really salty and that's the outfit
completely I think is another good so
that is the end of the video let us know
down below what you thought of the
outfits which one was your favorite yeah
definitely let me know yeah I was your
favorite which one just jump up with the
blue jeans and the baby yeah I really I
mean my favorite is this like my
favorite item that you bought is this
jumper you'd like that it was in the
show yeah it's so like on trend and I've
just been really liking like a cozy knit
jumper at the moment it's so cold
outside with the dyes in the showroom I
really like the jumper so you did really
well with that but definitely let me
know which one is your face yeah you

comments comments things good I might
just go shopping again exactly and we
