today I have yet another Halloween at
makeup tutorial this one is a bronzed
skull I wanted to create a different
skull to at the very regular like black
and white kind of skulls I've created
videos like that a thousand times on my
youtube already I'll have them linked or
down below in case you're interested
this one is a little bit more glam it's
a little bit more subtle but I still
really love the detail work in this and
I feel like it's actually quite easy to
achieve this video is actually in
collaboration with the body shop and I'm
so excited to be working with them again
if you guys enjoyed this video make sure
you smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and also subscribe if you haven't
already because I would love to have you
here come and join the dinosaur family
I'll also link all of my Halloween
series that are down below and also in
the little I've so you guys can check
those out but without further ado let's
get on into the video so I'm starting
off this look with my base already
finished and I'm just gonna move
straight into bronzing so today I'm
gonna be using the honey bronzing powder
from the body shop just applying that
onto my cheekbones and my temples really
bronze up the face and add that
definition back in there I'm then
reaching for my body shop contouring
palette and I'm taking the blush shade
and I'm just popping that onto my
cheekbones for a nice flush of color
next I'm taking the bronzing shade from
the same palette this goes against any
makeup techniques but you kind of want
to just leave a line of product on your
cheek to really add that definition and
this is gonna be the start of our skull
I'm then taking a smaller eyeshadow
brush and I'm starting to really carve
out the shape of my skull so I'm using
my cheek bone as a guideline to go along
at the curvature over and then I'm
creating an opposite band curling
downwards to kind of go alongside at the
corner of my mouth you want to repeat
the same thing on the other side and
then also move on to your temples say
for your temples you essentially want to
create a C shape and that's going to
create the curve of the skull on your
forehead I'm then going in and adding in
a bit more detail into my brows so I'm
just creating a little bit of a frown
upturn brow kind of shape and also
dragging that eyeshadow downwards into
the sockets of my eyes next thing you
want to do is start kind of carving out
the shape of your nose and I always say
this you can be as creative with this as
you like I'm then taking the gel velvet
pen I line
and I'm just going to start outlining
the shape of my nose with this and then
I'm gonna take the body shop matte black
kohl eyeliner as it is a little bit
thicker and I'm gonna use this hatch to
fill in the whole entire nose next I'm
gonna move on to using the darkening
shade of dusting drops and I'm actually
gonna use this to kind of further
outline the curvature of the skull this
is really gonna add a lot of depth there
and a lot of definition so I'm just
going along that very edge that we
created with the bronzer and I'm just
really sculpting that out and also
failing this downwards into the rest of
the bronzer this product is really easy
to blend more so than a face pink would
be because this is actually meant for
your foundation you can actually use
these drops to darken your foundation
but today I'm gonna be using these as
face paper because they are so pigmented
and they work super well next and we're
turning back to that honeycomb bronzer
and I'm just gonna use this to further
bronze out of the cheekbones and just
really blend everything together and
then taking the black gel pen liner
again and I'm just going to carve out
the edges of the skull even further
really adding a lot more depth there I
feel like the black really just helps to
outline that shape even more moving on
it next I'm gonna be using me down to
earth I palette and from this I'm gonna
be taking the Mac black shadow now with
a very small blending brush I'm gonna
apply this to the hollow of the skull
that we've been working on this whole
time adding a tiny bit of black in there
really makes a difference and as you can
see it's really just brought the top
section of the skull forward making it
look as if it's a mask on my face now
for the fun part we're gonna be using
the Mac hole liner as a highlight of the
skull so I'm starting to go along the
top edge of the skull as you can see I'm
doing here so I'm starting off with the
teeth and kind of curling it upwards
into the cheekbones as well and then I'm
using this to create very thin a pointy
teeth as you can see the liner is so
opaque so it really works super well for
this and then I'm just using that liner
to just go all over the skull here and
there wherever I feel like it needs a
little bit more lightness
what's our happy with all the shapes
that I've created I'm actually gonna
move on to the lower portion of the
skull so for this I'm just basically
creating a rounded rectangle and that's
gonna be the hollow of the jaw and then
I'm just gonna fill the edges of this
with the brown darkening drops and
really blend this out but what I'm gonna
do is I'm actually gonna leave at the
very middle of that hollow part to be
quite skin tone we don't want to pull
that Brown too far into the center and
then returning back to that black
eyeshadow and I'm just gonna go over the
hollows of the cheeks really just making
sure that everything is nicely blended
and also just creating even more depth
at the front of the mouth next I'm gonna
take the lightening shader adjusting
drops and I'm just gonna go over the
mouth portion and any of the highlights
just because this is a little bit more
pigmented than the coal liner so we're
gonna take advantage of that and really
layer up the product I feel like this
works super well over the lips too
because it doesn't make them too dry I'm
then taking that white coal line at once
again and just going over the edges of
the hollowed out part and then I'm gonna
take the shade light adjusting drops
once again on a brush and start creating
the teeth in the hollowed part sections
so for this you just literally want to
create some really elongated triangles
and as I'm drawing these I'm also
passing the top edges of the teeth to
kind of blend them in to the actual
hollowed part this is going to add a lot
more depth and definition and I feel
like this makes it look like the teeth
are actually inside the mouth rather
than on top to fix anything up and you
never turn back to the darkening shade
adjusting drops and just go between any
of the teeth where we may have smudged
the white a little bit and as you can
see this just really gives the teeth a
lot more shape I'm also gonna go ahead
and pull that Brown into the teeth
across my mouth is I feel like the one
as defined as they could have been
moving on to the eyes I'm gonna return
back to that Brown shadow from the
contour palette and I'm gonna use this
as a transition shadow on my eye so I'm
just popping that all over my lid and
also dragging it quite far down onto my
bottom lash line and then I'm gonna take
some of that black shadow and just pack
that on with a big packing brush all
over the lid and blend this out into it
kind of like a tapered shape once I'm
happy with the shape I'm gonna go ahead
and blend everything out so that there
is no harsh edges then to finish off the
eyes we're gonna go
ahead and add some lashes now for some
last touches on the face and returning
back to that white Kohl liner and I'm
creating some highlight just below my
brows with this I'm also gonna outline
the shape of my nose and any of the
hollow parts of my mouth just to make
the scar a little bit more visually
interesting
maybe onto the forehead I felt like this
was a little bit of a plain spot so I
decided to create like a little bit of a
centerpiece so I created this cross
designed to really just a fill that
space up and it doesn't really mean
anything I lit she just made it up on
the spot you could put whatever you like
on there now that the face is finished
we can move on to the neck part so for
this I'm just creating rounded
rectangles stacked on top of each other
to create a spine I'm drawing this on
with the darkening shade adjusting drops
once you're happy with the design you
can now go ahead and fill in the
positive space so what you want to do is
just leave out the squares and just
shade around them and then returning
back to that white Kohl liner and I'm
just using that to fill in the
rectangles of the spine so this is the
finished skull leaves tutorial I
absolutely love how this turned out I
feel like these contacts really complete
the look and it was just so easy to
achieve can literally just recreate this
with the products that you probably
already own I definitely write this
because it also didn't involve any face
paint and face thing can be sometimes a
little bit annoying to wear throughout
the whole night and it really kind of
wears off very quickly so using the body
shop shade adjusting drops for this was
definitely helpful this cuz I know that
this is gonna be so much longer wearing
than a face paint let me know down below
in the comments what you thought of this
look would you wear it and if you do
recreate it make sure you tag me on my
instagram at rocks horas but that is all
from me today i already have you guys
enjoyed this look and I'll see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
