today I'm gonna be testing out a makeup
product that has quite literally shook
the Internet and not in a good way
I'm a little bit late on the bandwagon
here because I've seen this video be
done by so many a youtubers already in
the past two weeks this is the video
that I've been seeing all over my
timeline and I just wanted to try it out
for myself I really did because I love
Tarte and I just really wanted to try
out the new Tarte foundation so this
little bad boy right here has sparked a
lot of controversy especially to do with
the launch of the product this has a
little recap for those of you who aren't
aware this foundation was released with
only 15 at different shades which I mean
the Apple emojis have more shade choice
and then these foundations and that's
saying something so there was this huge
outrage about that and I mean rightfully
so because we are in 2018 we need to
have more than 15 foundation shades and
we need to be able to supply choice for
all different ethnicities and this
Foundation launched basically just
completely missed that point and lacks
that completely and even two weeks after
the whole thing is blown over there's
still no sign of these other foundation
shades coming which they have promised
us they said that there would be like
five more shades or so where are they
who knows that is that whole thing out
of the way and by reviewing this
foundation by no shape or form am i
trying to promote that kind of thing I
just really wanted to review there such
as see if it's any good because I am a
huge fan of the Tarte shape tape
concealer I really hope you guys enjoy
the video if you guys are brand new and
make sure you come and subscribe come
and join as a dinosaur family but
without further ado let's get on into
the video okay so I have the foundation
right here so I only actually picked up
one of them because I wasn't sure
whether I would like the other one so
this one is the shape tape from matte
foundation but there's also the
hydrating one so the reason why I went
for the matte one is because I
personally prefer to wear matte shades
of foundation on my skin rather than
hydrating or dewy just because I do have
quite an oily skin especially in my
t-zone so I thought this would be a
perfect so this is what the packaging
looks like up close and this is what the
shape tape can see it looks like next to
it I really like the fact that they kept
the packaging a very similar now out of
the 15 shades Wu and I picked up
light/medium honey obviously this
is not gonna be the greatest match
because I'd matched it on the website
but we're gonna see I mean I'm pretty
sure that's gonna be my shade so
hopefully fingers crossed it will be oh
and this was 35 pounds not including
shipping I think I paid like five pounds
for shipping as well so that's not the
worst I mean that's the kind of price
you pay for a high-end foundation so
that's pretty standard
okay so let's crack this bad boy open oh
my god
why so it's got like a huge tart ape
like want like the concealer does that
is cool it's Mars it's not really the
most pungent of smells I can't really
smell it that much but it's definitely
like a typical chemically sort of
foundation smell but it's nothing too
major all right so I'm just basically
gonna pop this over my skin I have quite
a few blemishes at the moment and a bit
of redness on my skin so this should
cover it pretty nicely I'm hoping okay
so it's very like watery I don't know
why I thought that this would be quite a
similar kind of formula to the shape
tape conceal I don't know about you guys
but the shape tape concealer feels very
creamy and not really liquidy yeah
obviously this is the foundation so it's
a lot more liquidy I feel like this is
my shade which is good it's really well
to the skin with this little brush
however I don't know how hygienic this
is so they can see that it's not as bad
because obviously you're just applying
that under your eyes where's this if you
have breakouts you might actually want
to wash this little sponge because you
obviously don't want to spread acne and
spread bacteria around your face with
this okay so I'm just gonna take a flat
brush like this and just blend this into
the skin I would use a beauty blender to
blend this out but this is honestly the
brush that I use for my everyday
foundation whatever foundation might be
using this is the brush I use with it so
I felt like that would be the best way
to really put the foundation to the test
the color is really nice like really
really nice the only thing I don't like
about this foundation so far is that
it's making I don't know it's kind of
like clinging on to their hairs on
face now I don't really have a hairy
face but I mean you know everyone's got
a bit of hair on their face so it's kind
of just clinging on to it best worked
quite quick it's actually getting a
little bit harder to blend out now that
it's drying okay so the color is a
little bit orange from what I can see
maybe I should have gone a shade down
but it's not the worst I'm sure once it
oxidizes it will look a little bit
better the coverage is flawless though I
can't see any of my blemishes on my
cheek which is just incredible because I
usually have to go over with some kind
of concealer to cover up those pesky
blemishes I'm also gonna blend this down
my neck as well
okay guys I'm actually really annoyed
because there's not enough shades for
everyone to test this out I mean come on
ty you should have launched this when
you had all of the shades complete
rather than just some that's for a
second to not look at the difference
between my color but let's just have a
little focus on what the foundation
looks like on my skin okay so in the
description it said that a wooden crease
and it's already creasing quite a bit in
my smile line obviously that's to be
expected every foundation kind of does
that for me I feel like your look sort
of really flawless it does definitely
look a little bit drying in some areas
of my face like here or here so if you
already have dry skin I would definitely
not recommend this one maybe opt for the
hydrating foundation instead this one
it's definitely very drying but only in
some areas so I guess you can just kind
of counteract that by moisturizing quite
a bit before you apply this foundation
or use like a silicon based primer but
it's honestly not the end of the world
this foundation is just giving me life
right now like it's actually really
really good would it be my everyday sort
of foundation probably not but if I
wanted to go on like a night out or if I
wanted to take some selfies and I wanted
my skin to look really airbrushed and
perfect this would be the foundation
that I would kind of reach for I'm
really annoyed because I really don't
want to like this foundation purely for
the fact that they don't have enough
shades for everybody but I can't lie to
you guys it is a really good foundation
now just gonna go in with the shape
taper concealer by Tarte and I'm just
going to basically pop that under my
eyes
and blend it out I feel like some people
put so much of the tart shape tape on
their face but I find it really drying
under my eyes I only do the tiniest bit
actually forgot to do this before I
applied the foundation but I'm just
gonna quickly read to you guys what it
says about the foundation on the top
website so it says that it's a vegan and
oil free full coverage foundation with a
creamy texture and a modern matte finish
to complement our cult favorite
concealer I feel like the concealer is
definitely complementing the foundation
so that's a check it provides the same
full coverage as the concealer I mean
yeah I would say so her its moves over
pores and imperfections with rich
airbrushed full coverage the dress to a
flawless matte finish using a unique
concealer inspired wand I would say so
the formula absorbs oil and shine while
leaving skin at creaseless hydrated free
of flakiness or cakiness and helping to
improve skin health with every
application ok so what it says helping
to improve skin health with every
application hmm somebody tells me that's
not true I mean I've never heard that
makeup will actually make your skin
better like ever but I Brown is saying
that that's when you're kind of like mmm
I don't trust you now as for leaving the
skin creaseless definitely not because
you know there's creases in my smile
lines this crease is on my forehead
already that's just something you can't
really expect foundation not to do so I
feel like they shouldn't have chucked
that bit in okay but I'm now gonna go
and finish the rest of my makeup to
supply a bit of bronzer highlighter and
then I'll be right back okay so I am
back and my makeup is now complete I've
just popped on a little bit of bronzer
and a little bit of highlighter and I am
good to go this is what the makeup looks
like complete I honestly really really
like this foundation at the moment I am
gonna try and put this to the test
though because I really want to see how
it wears throughout the day today I'm
gonna check back with you guys in a
couple of hours and see what my skin
looks like and if my thoughts have
changed about it or not so we'll see and
I will see you guys in a couple of hours
okay guys so I am back and it's probably
been about hmm five hours since I've
last spoken to you guys roughly I've
just been basically at home just sitting
on the couch not really doing
just watching TV eating drinking that
kind of stuff yeah we're basically gonna
be taking a closer look at my skin right
now to see if there's any changes any
noticeable weirdness going on with my
face right now so first off the skin has
definitely become more and more dry
progressively like it looks really
really cakey and dry I don't know if you
guys will be able to see that but it's
just it looks really dry and like all of
my fine lines are showing it hasn't come
off of my skin luckily like there's no
spots of my face where I feel like the
foundation has rubbed off or anything I
think that it still looks really
flawless I think it's definitely covered
up all of my blemishes and it stayed
that way throughout the whole day pretty
much
dryness makes it look a little bit cakey
so I'm definitely not a fan of that
that's just me being super pedantic and
looking up close to see what I can find
like from afar you guys can you know you
can't really tell any of those things so
I feel like the foundation has performed
quite well over the couple of hours that
I've had it on actually pleasantly
surprised you know I'm really really
pleasantly surprised I want you guys to
let me know what you think of this
foundation as well would you try it or
would you try the other one which is the
hydrating one if any of you guys have
tried it already let me know your
thoughts as well underneath and let me
know whether I should get that one as
well I really hope you guys enjoyed this
mini review of the foundation obviously
I'm not like the best makeup artist or
guru out there I definitely found this
really interesting to test out I really
hope I did it justice and I tested it
fairly I feel like I have but do let me
know below if I miss anything out I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you would like to see a more testing
slash review and make up things videos
then let me know down below as well and
I will be sure to do more of those in
the future that is all from me thank you
