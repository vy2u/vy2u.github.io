going to do is take my hat and section
off this top crown sort of section
because that's the section we're going
to be teasing so what we're going to do
this is section it into layers and then
we're going to tease it one by one
whoa my hair looks super white
so once you look a little bit like
Priscilla Presley what you can do is
start forming this into a desired shape
and the beauty about this is that
because it's got so much volume you can
mold it to any shape that you like and
then I'm going in with my hair grips and
I'm just pinning that in place
so now I'm just taking this front
section by my ear and I'm twisting that
and what we're going to be doing is just
placing that over and behind this a
little booth on that we created so we're
just going to take it behind this
section here behind our ear and then
just clip it in place underneath our
hair before you clip this section in
place you have to make sure that you've
already pulled out a section to put on
the other side so I pulled this section
out prior to pinning that in place this
is very important or else the hairstyle
won't work so now we can just repeat the
same thing to the other side and just
tuck it behind the ear and underneath
the hair and just sort of grip it near
Wagle neck sort of line in so this is
the hairstyle done I really really like
this I feel like it gives a really like
60s sort of vibe to it and it's very
simple but really effective like it
looks like a foot or other thing to this
hairstyle when I have an at all so I
feel like it's a really good way to get
your hair on your face for a school day
but still look presentable and like you
put a lot of effort into your hair so
that is all for this tutorial I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did then
definitely give it a thumbs up that will
help me out a lot and if you would like
to see any more hair tutorials on this
channel then also let me know down below
anything guys happen to recreate this
hairstyle and definitely tag me on
instagram or DM me it I read all of your
messages so I will definitely see it so
that is all I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you soon bye
what is this this is like some
gravity-defying sorcery right here hi
guys today I'm going to be filming a
huge collective makeup haul</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
