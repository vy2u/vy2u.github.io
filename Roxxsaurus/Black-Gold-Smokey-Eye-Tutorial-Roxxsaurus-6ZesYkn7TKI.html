so first things first I'm going to start
off by using some masking tape and we're
going to use a tiny tiny bit of this
just to stick on the outer corner just
so we get a very crisp line and I'm
using masking tape because it's not as
sticky as sellotape so it doesn't pull
your eyelashes iron is very gentle on
the skin so I'm just placing that in the
line sort of from my nostril to the end
of my eyebrow same way that you would
line your eyes and then I'm taking my
Rimmel Kohl eyeliner this is the
exaggerate waterproof eyeliner and all
I'm doing is I'm just popping that along
the masking tape and I'm blending that
out into the middle of my eye very very
messily because I'm going to blend this
out anyway then to blend it out you can
use a regular brush but I'm going to use
the little smudgy bit at the end of this
pencil and you have to work quite
quickly with this because once you leave
it on for too long in the same place it
will settle and it will make it harder
for you to blend it all out then you can
just rip that off and you've got a nice
clean and crisp edge now the only real
purpose of putting eyeliner there is to
sort create a darker base for the
eyeshadow and I'm going to go in with
the Naked 2 palette and I'm going to use
blackout which is this one here it's a
very dark and matte black shadow it's
probably the darker shadow bio-and using
the same brush from the palette I'm
going to pack that on into the outer
corner just overlaying the black liner
once we've achieved this sort of
starting point I'm going to also drag
the black down my lower lash line just
connecting the really sharp edge that
we'd created with a masking tape I'm
also going over the edge a little bit
just a sort of fabric
art and defuse the harsh line so it
should look something like this and next
I'm going to go in with T's from the
same palette just this one here and I'm
going to use that as a transition color
so I'm just going to pop that in the
crease just above the black just to sort
of transition the color very nicely out
into the skin tone because I've put a
bit too much on I'm just going to dust
it off on my hand and blend that out
next I'm going to return to the black
and I'm going to pop that in E in the
corner just slightly missing in the
actual corner so we're going to place it
just here but missing out the actual
inner corner if that makes sense
so very very likely I'm creating this
sort of triangle shape in my inner
corner as you can see and then I'm going
to blend that out but all you're to
leave this central part clean of the
shadow
so now I'm just going over the black
just packing horrible shadow on to get
the desired opaqueness next I'm taking
this flat brush I'm not sure where this
is from but it looks like this and I'm
going to take half-baked watching this
one here and I'm going to pop it in the
center of my eyelid
I'm mostly taking that in the inner
corner very very lightly now I'm taking
a slightly smaller fluffy brush and I'm
taking half-baked as well and I'm
popping that just above the brown as a
nice little sheen of shimmer now that
I'm happy with how everything looks I'm
going to take a angled fluffy brush and
I'm going to diffuse the edges of the
gold just by drawing it inwards right
there so it blends nicely into the black
and I'm also going to try and slightly
blend the inner corner with the black as
well so it should look something like
this lastly I'm going to go in with foxy
and booty-call which are these two and
I'm going to pop that on the brow bone
just to highlight it a little bit
next I'm going to go in with eyeliner
and this is the felt tip miss sporty
liner I've been using this a lot
recently and it's so good so now I'm
just going to follow this line the
outline and just exaggerate that little
bit more liner
then I'm taking the coal liner by Rimmel
and I'm just reminding my tightline and
waterline with it next I'm just going to
be using at the Max Factor 2,000 calorie
mascara looks like this and I'm just
coating my lashes with this a few times
just to prepare them for false lashes
this mascara is probably one of the best
disguise I've ever used like it just
makes your stubble excusive lashes look
so much better and of course I'm doing
the bottom lashes too but you don't have
to do this
moving on to lashes I'm going to be
using these ones and these ones are the
Kimberly eye lashes and look like this
and they're so pretty
so I'm just gonna go put them on and
I'll be right back so this is the eye
look with the eyelash on and I think
that this eyelash looks really pretty
it's very natural it's really easy to
stick on and I usually find eyelashes
very difficult to work with so I think
that this is like the perfect eyelash
it's not too long it's not too dramatic
but adds that little extra something so
on the scale of one to ten humpin do I
look I think I might just you know hit
the town like this
so this is the final look I hope you
guys like it it's very very dramatic so
it's probably best for like clubbing or
any sort of like nighttime
you know event I decided to pair it with
a nude lip because if I paired it with
color I think can be too overdone so the
products I used for my lips is the
Clarins
lip liner in Pauline and the lipstick
light used is actually by Claire's it
looks like this and this is in shade
nude and it's this like nice nude color
so what so yeah if you guys would like
to see more of these dramatic out of my
comfort zone sort of makeup looks then
please let me know by giving me a thumbs
up on this video and subscribe you Kevin
running I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day as I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
