wintery brown makeup blur this makeup
look is actually in collaboration with
L'Oreal so all of the products I used
actually drugstore so everything is
really affordable and really accessible
to all of you so if you guys want to see
how I achieve this glam wintry makeup
look then just keep watching so firstly
I'm reaching for my L'Oreal infallible
24 hour foundation and I'm just applying
that on my dark circles and any
blemishes that I may have on my face I'm
really liking this foundation at the
moment because it gives you quite a bit
of coverage but it's not too cakey at
the same time for my cheeks I'm using
the Loreal the blush in shade peach
I think this shade gives you a nice
flush of healthiness to your skin then
to fill my brows I'm reaching for the
Loreal brow artist genius kit and I'm
using the lightest shade to fill in my
arch and also the beginning of my
eyebrows
maybe onto the ice I'm using the Loreal
La Follette nude in shade beige and I'm
reaching for the champagne color which
is the second from the left and I'm
applying that in my inner corner using a
flat brush
next I'm applying the third shade I'm
just applying that into the crease to
act as a sort of gradient color for the
later shadows that we're going to apply
next next I'm going to be taking the
copper shade from this palette and I'm
applying that on the outer half of my
eyelids using a flat brush we're really
trying to pack that color on with a flat
brush so that we don't get much fallout
and then returning back to my zoeva
blending brush and I'm using that to
blend the two shadows that we applied
onto the lid so that we get a seamless
transition from the light to the dark
shade now I don't know about you guys
but most shadow palettes that I buy have
never had the perfect brush that comes
with it but this palette I'm using at
the moment actually comes with this
little handy brush that's quite fluffy
and quite precise at the same time so
I'm using that to pull the shadow along
the lower lash line as well I'm now
reaching for the last shade which is the
darkest shade of the pallet and it
appears to be like a dark navy kind of
shade but when you apply it onto the lid
it comes out more gray and really kind
of smoking cool toned which I really
like so I'm using that in the outer
corner in a V motion and then I'm also
pulling that on the lower lash line as
well
lastly I'm returning back to you my flat
brush and I'm pulling that same copper
shadow into the inner corner for the
liner I'm gonna be creating a really
subtle cat line and I'm gonna be using
the super liner by L'Oreal for this this
line that gives a really thin and
precise line which I really like and
it's also a felt tip liner so it makes
it very very easy to use now for the
mascara the one I'm using is the false
lash sculpt and this is by L'Oreal this
is one of their new releases which is
happening very soon and I'm so excited
to be one of the first people to be able
to try this mascara and so far I am
loving it I love the brush of it because
it literally allows you to catch every
single lash when I wore this look out my
boyfriend actually asked me if I was
wearing false lashes which is always a
good sign this new brush is actually
designed to catch the lashes all the way
from the root which makes them look so
much more darker and fuller and really
really long
now to finish off the look the lipstick
I'm using is from their new collection
which is called the collection exclusive
by Blake and this is in shade Blake's
pure red I love this color so so much
because it's really creamy but matte at
the same time and that's a very very
rare thing to come by so that has the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed it
if you did then definitely give it a
thumbs up and also if you guys are
wondering the new plush I'm wearing is
also by L'Oreal and this is in shade
