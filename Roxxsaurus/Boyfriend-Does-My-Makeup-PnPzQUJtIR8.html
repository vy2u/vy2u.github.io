he's going to be doing my makeup which I
much you really see at all
we're going to do is grunge makeup what
I say was is grunge inspired by tumblr
had a look at some blur it's gonna be
back to school
and it's gonna have some beauty hacks
initely didn't already know all right
y'all ready sorry
let's just jump right in so what are you
gonna start with we've got all setup of
makeup and brushes so he can literally
just use anything he likes
I'm not gonna lie I haven't done my
research I just washed it we'll see how
well you watch my video oh yeah so it's
our laughs I think it's pretty best to
start by moisturizing your face cuz good
call Guinness how do you think's a
goddess getting that true SH dollop of
that can I put it just lame okay they're
fine oh okay yeah all over the lips
honest you've got a good thing on earth
No okay on your eyes okay so I think
like a BB cream or concealer there's
nothing to conceal so we start off with
this Bobbi Brown Foundation you showed
them this is a foundation some of the
projects usually actually say what it is
in the back is a foundation what is in
the back can this concealer which is the
same thing okay
what you want brushing is this one use
the big Brush Kellogg cover in a big
area okay I'm not a tiny little pot
you're gonna use a big brush so here's a
slightly smaller one go with it this uh
what is it techniques so come on
no it's really nice it's a contour brush
okay so it's further than oh I'm
basically gonna do a lot I make up I'm
going to put some on the eyelids looks
like your foundation done up to you the
Foundation's done next I'm going to take
what is that I don't know
next I'm going to take this blusher Wow
okay go blush it down this pink yes and
we're just gonna highlight the cheek the
bone doesn't desert it's primarily put
this on before foundation yep no but you
can I sleep primed for nothing to go on
top okay so the cheeks are now primed
I was lying earlier when I said what as
I was blusher yep anything Omega I've
got a blusher here I drew from that
fight because of this nice color of go
ahead and I go really well on that area
going to highlight that contouring oh
they are on nothing like this in a
little bit more my color spit out maybe
a big model yeah do you think do you
think that except me this is this has
happened I'm not cutting this out I'm
not it happen there you go I'm gonna
it's perfect now we've got this perfect
base coat okay yeah what are you using
now sleek blush it's just blush on it
okay gonna take some blush and just put
it there why why do you want to put that
it makes it look nice in the light all
right now I'm gonna move on to the eyes
now for this I'm going to take my nude
palette I'm going to use a small brush
easy things are evil uh crease brush so
we have Alex Chris bus this bus bus oh
it's the reason this brush is good is
for creases on the eyes oh so I'm gonna
take sexy can we use that one here we're
going to just put this on the eyes
now we have a quite dramatic look here
for school everyone wants to be a role
and we just blend it up you know into
the eyebrow line and we're also going to
take it under the eye because please
don't stop me please that's what lunch
people do oh my god I look so good no
idea the other eye just repeat the same
you can for like a punch smokey eye yeah
I was punched in deal how can we take it
out to the brow it's more dramatic
oh do you like it like that should I
start doing it yeah now that we've done
now that we've done the eyes I'm going
to go ahead and get some mascara safer
than what you got
so I've got this eyebrow pencil yeah so
I do your eyebrows first I'm sorry but
makeup artists do not use this saliva to
work but make up this midnight black
hole slash black cops vanish please just
don't put me we do Taylor and you start
underneath and if you twist it slightly
it water COEs the lashes up you're
scratching with I mean it we're done
with her it's the Schwing I lined it
from the bar now grunge people usually
have eyeliner from here okay keep still
can feel my thighs things stuck together
right now
oh you're going for like the Egyptian
kind of cat eyeliner yeah
alright so mostly guys just feel like
it's worth a battalion I'm doing another
video how to do the perfect eyeliner now
that both eyes look the same I'm gonna
go for something slightly natural but
also quite grungy oh you did this
look like Miranda sings right now very
much all done so I take you guys some
hats down by this like sleek palette fit
got laughs yes some wipes could always
overdo makeup don't worry a really good
hack is you
finger net simple everyone Enza and use
your palate to draw a line so you're
actually not even using the palette for
open up so this is your technique
you put loads and loads makeup and then
you rub out it is perfect
basically very cool oh my oh my gosh she
stopped doing that on my challenge
videos you could do a whole pies
completely black about the other one
that's such a good idea why are you
feeling my over okay so that guys is the
finished look should I see it why did
you take the eye sugar so low underneath
my eyes that's not what groans person
looks oh is it the lips I like how it's
got like the red shadow
it's not a shadow it just looks like
I've been kissing a pig and just smeared
with a mullet and if you're wondering
what we're doing tonight going out to
dinner I will actually go out with us
and I will embarrass you so as you can
see I covered on the eyeliner extra long
to get that really nice line all right
so what that does is create an extreme
dramatic fit so guys this is the
finished look we've done another video
on my channel which was the one two
three couple establishes you should go
chat hall

somewhere around this video something's
