Oh
hi guys today I'm going to be filming
this bridal wedding makeup I hope you
guys enjoy it so let's just jump right
in so the first step for a wedding
makeup is obviously to priming the
eyelids and today I'm going to be using
the urban decay primer and I've got a
little tester of it so I'm just going to
be using that next what I'm doing is I'm
taking a neutral shadow and the one that
much you're going to be using is this
one from a collection eyebrow kit now I
find that using a shadow that's closest
to your skin tone after you apply the
primer just make sure that your
eyeshadows are easier to blend if you
ever touch your primer right after
you've applied it if you're sort of
sticky but after you apply a shear layer
of shadow it feels much more satin and
smoother to glide on your shadows
afterwards the next chatter that I'm
reaching for is this orange one here
this is from the sleek or natural
palette this one is sort of similar to
Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and that
is a very common transition shadow for a
lot of beauty gurus on YouTube so I'm
just going to be dusting that on a
little fluffy angled brush and I'm going
to pop that in the crease and very
lightly and this shadow is a very
forgiving shadow so you can kind of be
quite messy with this and literally just
sweep it around the crease very roughly
as you can see it doesn't make a whole
lot of difference but it just creates a
slight base shadow for when you want to
blend out your other shadows that you
place later on the next shadow that I'm
going to be reaching for is this one
here and it's a gorgeous cool toad sort
of shimmery champagne color this is by
accessorized and it's called silk baked
eyeshadow in shade Ruby I really love
this eyeshadow for the inner part of
your eye and that's exactly what I'm
going to be placing it today so I'm
taking that on a flat brush like this
this brush is a known name brush I don't
know what it's called but any flat
shadow brush will do what we're going to
do is just pack that onto the center and
pull that into the inner corner as well
and we're packing this on to get the
best pigment out of the shadow as
opposed to sweeping it around if you
sweep it around that's just gonna make
it fly everywhere
and you don't want that you want to
concentrate the whole pigment in the
center and in a corner of your eye and
I'm also going to place that right in my
inner corner as well just to open up
this area and especially for a wedding
look this is just going to make your
eyes look so much brighter and more
awake and especially for photography
this is just going to photograph so
beautifully as the light reflects from
it I'm also going to pull that into my
brow bone just to highlight it slightly
as well
now this leg is actually going to be a
little bit more quartern than the
traditional warm-toned bridal eye makeup
so I'm going to be a reaching for a gray
shadow from the same sleek palette which
is this one here and loading that up
onto a fluffy brush I'm just going to be
placing that on the outer edge and also
blending that into the outer portion of
our crease so just be sure to gradually
and build up this color so it doesn't
become too dark too quickly next I'm
going to be going in with a cool toned
dark brown which is this one here also
from the all-natural sleek palette this
time I'm taking a more precise brush
which is this sort of like pencil shaped
dome brush just to add a little bit more
depth but still keeping it quite subtle
I'm going to be creating a u-shape with
this so we're going from the crease into
the lash line just like this now we can
go back in with our fluffy brush and
just blend this out
then I'm going to be returning back to
that same gray shadow and just blend
that over this dark brown that we placed
what you have to do is just really keep
blending it until everything is nicely
faded in I'm never turning back to my
flat brush and dusting off any remaining
residue of that earlier shadow and I'm
going to be using this to line the lower
lash line so I'm going to be reaching
for that dark brown in that gray shadow
again and just mixing them together and
then just pulling that into the lash
line to tie the whole look together
so as you can see so far what we've
created is this sort of round shape
around the eye so it's sort of like a
halo smokey eye as opposed to a tapered
cat eye and the reason why I did that is
because it looks much softer and
especially in photos it's going to look
more natural but to actually break up
this circle we're going to be creating a
smoky line right here using a black
shadow and the reason why we're going to
be using a black shadow as opposed to an
eyeliner is that again it's going to
look much more natural and just soft and
delicate and very feminine so I'm now
actually reaching for a different
palette and the one I'm using is the
Naked 2 palette I'm going to be using
black out which is probably the darkest
black shadow that I own I'm taking that
on a little angled brush and this is by
Mac but I'm not too sure which one this
is so just any angled brush will do that
so what I'm doing is I'm loading that up
on the brush and then I'm just tapping
that on my hand to dust off any of the
product that may have not been picked up
by the bristles properly and what we're
going to be doing first is just creating
a thin line right next to the lash line
so I'm just packing that product in to
the lash line
now that that's done we can start
preaching at the soft wing on the outer
corner so we're just going to be joining
that line and slightly flicking it out
like this
so this is what you want to be aiming
for it's a nice subtle line that
slightly smoked out into a little wing
and then what you can do is pull that
line underneath your lower lash line as
well just to connect to that wing
next I'm taking my Rimmel scandaleyes
Kohl eyeliner and this is in shade zero
zero nude and I'm going to be using that
to line my lower waterline with this and
what that is going to do is just open up
the eye a lot more and make it look
larger and more awake and then I'm also
taking my Rimmel exaggerate coal liner
in black and I'm just going to be using
that to tightline my upper lash line now
for mascara you ideally want to use
something waterproof but because I don't
have one I'm just going to be using my
favorite mascara I'm just going to be
using this L'Oreal false wings
midnight black on this car which looks
like this I don't know if they actually
sell this in England or if it's being
sold anymore but it's so beautiful
because of this amazing wand it just
creates the most beautiful lashes now
for the lower lashes I'm going to be
using a slightly smaller mascara and I'm
going to be using and there's a YSL
babydoll mascara and this is a little
tester but the wand is like perfect for
the bottom lashes because it's so thin
and so small now for lashes I'm going to
be using at these Kimberly lashes and
these are created by Tyler I've actually
cut them down into little Demi lashes
though because I feel like if you have a
whole band of eyelash on your eye throw
a whole day it's just going to feel
horrible in your eyes and you really
don't want that on your wedding day and
if you're going to wear a whole full
band of eyelashes you are just exposing
yourself to a major risk of unsticking
of the eyelash in the corners and you
definitely don't want to be like
fiddling around with your eyelash on
your wedding day so I personally feel
like the Demi lashes or single lashes
are the perfect option for a wedding
makeup look so I'm just going to go
ahead and stick on my other eyelash and
I'll be right back so I have just
applied the upper eyelash and I love
these so much because there's still that
kind of natural but give that extra
wispy nurse and butterfly effect to your
eyelashes on the outer corners and they
just make your lashes look very fluttery
and pretty not to achieve that flawless
complexion for your wedding day you are
going to want to you
a foundation that has no SPF in it
you're going to have photos have you
taken all day and you don't want any
flash bag on the camera when there's
flash photography for today I'm actually
just going to be using a concealer and
the one I'm using is the Bobbi Brown can
see that but unfortunately I don't know
which shade this is in because labor has
completely rubbed off I think it's like
a foundation stick actually so I'm just
going to be using this to get rid of any
under-eye circles or any blemishes that
I may have so the PAP I'm going to be
using is this Rimmel stay matte powder
you can never go wrong with this powder
there's so many shades of this I'm going
to using this a flat top brush to apply
it you're not going to be swirling it
around your face or anything you just
want to really buff it in to make sure
it comes out most effective and that way
you're going to reduce any pores that
you may have and also effectively absorb
any moisture on your face next we're
going to be bronzing up the face a
little bit and for this I'm going to be
using it this cute little bronzer which
is by the balm and this is in shade take
a dip it looks like this this is a
really gorgeous a bronzer shade but I
feel like it can also act as a blush
because it's quite a universal shade you
can just apply that on your jaw line
just to sharpen your jaw line up a
little bit nothing blush I feel like
something that quite peachy and
natural-looking will be gorgeous with
this look so I'm going to be reaching
for this blush by Guerlain and it's this
nice peachy shade and I love this so
much it's one of my staple blushes of
all time so I'm taking my Real
Techniques blush brush and I'm just
applying that to the apples of my cheeks
now for the lips I'm thinking about
using a nude sort of pinky natural
looking shade and I'm personally going
to be lining my lips with this Clarins
lip liner and this is in shade prolene
so applying that lip liner is just going
to ensure that your lipstick stays on in
the same place all day long and doesn't
go outside of the lines and not for the
lipstick I'm going to be going in with
Mac velvet teddy the reason why I chose
this lipstick is because
it's matte and it's like the perfect
nude shade so this is going to act as a
great base for our lipstick and this
literally doesn't budge it's like one of
the most long lasting lipsticks that I
have so I feel like using this as a base
to shade for the lips is just going to
make sure that any lipstick that we
placed on afterwards it's just going to
have something to stick onto and cling
throughout the whole day so I feel like
this look on its own it's already a
great look for a wedding makeup but
because that flash photography can tend
to wash out the pigments on your face
and especially your lips I feel like
going for a slightly more pink toned lip
is going to be a more safe of an option
so over this lipstick I'm actually going
to be using this lipstick by who are you
Maybelline New York and this is called
power peony and this is a lovely pink
shade it looks a very very pink on a
camera but it's much more toned down in
person and we're not going to be using
this like all over the lips we're going
to be using a sheer there of this over
the MAC lipstick so this is the final
look I hope you guys enjoyed this and I
don't know if this is like a traditional
wedding makeup look but if I was to get
married like tomorrow this is probably
what I do on myself so if you enjoyed

thumbs up and if you want to see any
