I hate you guys are doing super well
today I am back with an oldie but goodie
I feel like no one has been doing either
dupes behind makeup videos anymore it's
been like a so popular like last year
but I haven't seen a single video on it
anymore like it just died now I'm going
to bring it back for you guys is a
revive and the trend because who doesn't
need drugstore alternative for expensive
AF maker if you guys need to take a
video on my channel before all these all
the links to the videos I've done in the
past of videos like this if you guys
enjoy this video make sure you smash
that he comes up just down below and
also subscribe to our brand new come and
join the dinosaur family did I will it
be the SmackDown between the drugstore
and our end then let's get into this
okay I am so first thing first this side
of my face is going to be my drugstore
side whereas this side is going to be my
high-end side and I wonder why my
foundation already exists to save a
little bit of time I feel like there
wasn't any new Dukes that we were
showing you guys I thought I would just
give it all together and move straight
on to the console the high-end
product I'm going to be using is the Too
Faced based luminous glow bronzer cumin
is really cute heart packaging and
honestly it's in one my favorite
Rhonda's for a long time really easy to
blend and the color is gorgeous
but it is a little bit pricey so I
actually found a really close
alternative to this at the drugstore and
the dude for this bronzer is the Summer
of Love
tripled base bronzer by the brand I
heart makeup this brand you can actually
get in super drug and it's super
affordable this cost me only five pound
honestly it's just as pretty as the
toothpaste product but you get at a
fraction of the price which is so good
so as you can see the color is certain
level both of these products they are
honestly so we've been packaging as well
and on the face there is literally no
difference Apple I'm now going to move
on to the blush and again this is
another two-faced product I'm going to
be using the love lush two-faced love
hangover life also comes with a little
cue heart packaging and kind so it's so
beautiful is very wearable for everyday
and now it'll be a portable version of
the black I feel across this Lahti
London black crush in shade Zayn and the
packaging may look a lot different
like the colors look really different on
the outside but when you actually open
the product
the color is so so similar you go for
today and you're the packaging and just
look at the product side by side the
product is pretty much identical in
color I'm now going to be one to
highlight her and I'm so excited for
this one because I didn't actually think
I'd be able to find a dupe for this but
the Highland High Life is I'm using is
the make up for ever highlight hat look
how gorgeous and this is it didn't
shaded Pro at like fusion and the color
is just so gorgeous
look at it and I actually managed to
find a drugstore do for that highlighter
and I was so freaking Stokes I found
this one here and look at it they are
pretty much identical this one is from
makeup revolution this is the vivid
baked highlighter this was honestly
circle and what I can't remember off the
top of my head how much this was but it
was about three pounds and this is about
twenty roughly 20 pounds our next are
the eyebrows so fully high inside I've
got the a nostalgia dip brow pomade in
shades blonde this is my go-to eyebrow
product honestly I love it so so much
and volatile fire I managed to find a
similar product and this is by anyway
luck this is the powder brow log we're
cooked in brow gel and this is in shade
in this brown this is what it looks like
I really like the fact that it's got a
little brush which obviously in the a
nostalgic comment doesn't come with see
the Bible is similar in color obviously
in the pomade you get a lot more product
whereas in the anyways it's only a tiny
tiny pot so this is what the eyebrows
look like honestly they are pretty much
identical the color is so thin I
couldn't even tell the difference that
I'm wearing different products in each
eyebrow and I obviously don't know how
whom this products were lost in my
eyebrows because this was only drugstore
he was only 2 pounds so perhaps in this
instance the a nostalgic product might
win for longevity but visually they both
look pretty much the same I'm now going
to be going to the eye shadow which is
the most exciting part of this view
because the Dukes I found is honestly
it's the best so for my high-end side
I'm going to be using every to face
service wheat chocolate bar palette this
is one of my go-to palette I honestly
love this palette and now I'm my dupe
I'm going to be using at the I heart
makeup palette with this like red it's
actually very similar to the Too Faced
palette I mean they are slightly
different but the whole chocolate thing
is obviously a borrowed from Too Faced
but wait for it wait for it the
eyeshadows are exactly the same they are
this even like the order is the same the
only difference is that the black and
white shadows are kind of on the
opposite sides in the palette but I love
this is such a close loop I cannot wait
to driving so it's all my eye on the
side I'm going to be taking at this
shade here and I'm gonna apply this as
my transition shadow into my crease and
then going to make the eye heart makeup
palette and then use that the equivalent
shader from this palette and do the same
thing to the other side I'm then making
the shadow moves from the Too Faced
palette and I'm applying that so that
into the crease to deepen it up and I'm
going to do the same thing or with the
other palettes onto my drugstore side
and then I'm gonna take the shader
truffled up from the Too Faced palette
and apply this into my upper crease and
then I'm going to pick the equivalent
shadow from the eye part makeup palette
and repeat the same step onto my
drugstore side now I'm asking to finish
off the eyes I'm going to take the shade
bonbon and I'm going to just apply this
into the center of my eyelid I'm going
to really the same set and use a deep
copper shadows from the I heart makeup
palette now really wanna do eyeliner I
don't actually own a high-end eyeliner I
only own drugstore ones because they are
already amazing like my iron I'm just
going to be using the pistol Eiko liner
which is a felt it's lined up for the
both of my eyes so by the eyeliner
finish
and I'm now going to move on to adding
mascara so to a high-end slide I'm going
to be using the Too Faced better than
sex mascara this is such a great mascara
honestly make sure life is so thick and
so volumize and for the addresses if I'm
going to meeting and enabling that
colossal Big Shot mascara not only it
business are a much more affordable but
also really good it does pretty much the
same thing as the two first one it has a
very similar brush its reset again mixed
relations really volume lines just like
the Too Faced one and it also makes them
a super thick now many homes of the lips
I'm going to be using it my all time at
favorite lipsticks for the high-end side
and this is the Too Faced melted matte
lipstick and this isn't shaded cool girl
if you guys follow my Instagram you will
know that I listed where this so so much
every single post on web and news
lipstick in it is more than likely this
one here this lipstick is so
long-lasting it always makes my lips
look so much bigger than they are
because you can actually over line with
this and it's not like obvious or
anything you know - right now is looking
super weird but for the drugstore side
I'm going to be using B it NYX lingerie
liquid lipstick in shade of push-up the
color is not quite identical but it's a
very very close to and you can see the
car on the drugstore side is just a tiny
bit lighter than this one but all in all
of this color is very close to this one
so I feel like it's the best tip that I
could have found and I love it is like I
obviously cannot see a difference can
you guys see a difference because I
can't it really just goes to show how
you do not need a high-end makeup day so
expensive don't get me wrong is
definitely nice to treat yourself to
some high-end makeup once in a while
this video goes to show that you
definitely do not need to buy them all
the time because there are so many
drugstore alternatives for high-end
makeup and I'm so so impressed with how
they turned out I'm going to pop up the
sum of each of the side here and you can
really see for yourself how you do not
need to spend this kind of money would
you be spending this kind of money so
that was all for this video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and found it
helpful if you don't enjoy this video
make sure you smash that he sums up and
just down below and all they subscribe
if you are brand new I would love to
have you day guys one for me I really
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
