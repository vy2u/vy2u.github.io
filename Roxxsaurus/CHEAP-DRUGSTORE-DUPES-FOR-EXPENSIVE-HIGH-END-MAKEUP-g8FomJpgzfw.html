today I have a very exciting video I'm
basically gonna be comparing a high-end
versus drugstore makeup I actually have
half-and-half makeup right now using
half drugstore half iron I really want
you guys to guess which one is drugstore
and which one is high-end right now and
also get your friends involved pretty
shot in this video right now and
basically send it to one of your friends
and see if they can guess as well or
which side is drugstore in which side is
high-end don't forget to let me know in
the comments whether they were right or
not but yeah I really wanted to do
another one of these videos because I
haven't done one in a while
and I have found so many good dupes for
high-end makeup especially popular
high-end makeup as well I honestly I'm
so so happy with how this makeup look
turned out it literally looks identical
I came on here right now and you guys
didn't know I was doing this video you'd
never be able to tell that I'm wearing
different makeup on each side of my face
so I mean that is pretty impressive so
if you guys want to see what I use for
my face then let's get on into the video
okay guys so we're gonna start off with
priming our face so for the high inside
we're gonna be using my trusty YSL
Touche Clark primer which retails for
2950 and this primer is going to go up
against this one right here which is the
drugstore version now this is the
flawless original primer by barrio which
only costs $5.99 now these primers are a
lot different from each other because
obviously this one is clear whereas this
one has more of a white consistency in
the bottle but when they're applied to
the skin they have the same kind of like
silicone any consistency and I honestly
feel like that just as good as each
other so I've just got a little bit of
the berry m1 on my finger right here and
I'm just gonna kind of dab it onto the
skin and just apply it to my left hand
side as I said as you're blending this
into the skin it becomes clear but
obviously in the bottle it is white in
color now I'm gonna go in with the wire
saw primer and just blend that into the
skin on the other side okay moving on to
the foundation for the high end side I'm
gonna be using in the trusty Giorgio
Armani luminous silk this is one of my
favorite high-end foundations and it is
a whopping 42 pounds which is just so
expensive so a dupe for this that I
found in the drugstore is this one right
here now this is the Maybelline Dream
satin liquid this is only $7.99 so I
mean in comparison that's a big big
price difference I honestly think that
they're quite close in consistency
finish is kind of like luminous and very
glowy and Juby which I really like about
both of these foundations so I've got
two different beauty blenders that I'm
gonna be using to apply the foundation
please excuse this one
my cat Skye has gotten into it and it's
got lots of cool marks I'm gonna apply
the luminous soap onto the high-end side
first just kind of kind of dab that all
over the skin I honestly really really
love this foundation it is so sad how
expensive it is though kind of got like
a medium coverage so it's perfect for
everyday sort of where it's like not too
much and not too high in coverage if
that makes any sense I absolutely love
this as my everyday foundation and now
for the drugstore side I'll be taking
some of the Maybelline Dream satin and
just kind of dotting it all over my face
again I've got quite a few blemishes on
my cheek and this foundation really
covers them up very well and again I
love the fact that it's so wearable
throughout the day it doesn't feel like
too much on your skin but it's like the
perfect amount of coverage as well so
I'm just gonna blend that in with the
other Beauty Blender and look at this
it's just blending so beautifully into
the skin I mean look at my skin I
honestly don't feel like there's any
difference or whatsoever obviously we're
gonna test this for a few hours and see
how the foundation wears but for the
initial appearance there is literally no
difference now to make the skin even
brighter we're gonna be reaching for
some illuminating sticks now I have one
here which is from YSL this is a very
well-known like radiance day and it's
called the two o'clock radiance touch
this retails for 25 pounds 50 which is
quite pricey for a little product like
this but don't worry guys I do have a do
this is the Dream Lumi touch by
Maybelline and this only costs $7.99 but
for the products have a very similar
concept they both have a brush and this
one has a twisty and to get all of the
product up whereas this one has a button
this one is a little bit more pinky tone
than this one but honestly once you
blend into the skin there's not really
that much difference so I'm just gonna
go ahead and just kind of concealed
underneath my eyes a little bit and also
kind of bring that onto the cheekbone
it's you highlight a little bit with
that as well I'm gonna pop it on at my
brow bone and kind of my lid as well to
prime it and I'm even gonna go
down the side of my nose with this as
well then I'm gonna take the drugstore
alternative and basically do the same
thing okay so this is what the products
are the player on my skin
honestly like I said this side is a lot
more pink toned but we're just gonna
blend this out with the warmth of our
finger so this is what my skin looks
like now honestly I literally see no
difference I feel like both of the
products are really great but if you
don't have the money to splurge on a
wire sell product you might as well just
opt for the drugstore now I'm gonna do a
little bit more concealing because your
girl's got some under-eye circles going
on so we're going to go for the Tarte
shake tape on the high-end this retails
for 20 pounds roughly and then we're
gonna go for the very hyped over
concealer from a revolution it's called
the conceal and define at full coverage
concealer and contour I got this in
shade c1 I believe which is like the
lightest shade I could find this only
retails for 4 pounds so these two
concealers have been highly compared in
the beauty world by so many bloggers and
I'm so good that there's finally a dupe
for the Tarte shaped ape concealer
because it's honestly like life it is
one of the best concealers I've ever
tried so I'm really really excited that
there's a drugstore alternative now so
obviously the packaging of the two
products are quite a bit different the
drugstore side is a lot smaller it has
only 3.4 male whereas the Tarte one has
a 10 ml inside the product obviously you
are paying a lot more for this one
because you get a lot more product as
well times are going to apply both of
the concealers at the same time and then
blend them out so we can kind of get a
comparison of the colors ok so just from
looking at it the Tarte shaped tape is a
lot darker and a lot more warm toned
whereas the revolution concealer is a
lot more like yellow toned it's a little
bit lighter in shade so I'm just gonna
blend both of them out now with my damp
Beauty Blender so the tight shape they
blend it out so well this is literally
wise one of my favorite concealers and
then for the revolution side oh my
goodness this product is so high in
coverage it is just like the top shape
tape so this is what both of the
concealers look like they have covered
up my dark circles so well they're both
just as good as each other honestly in
my opinion so I feel like the revolution
one is a very very good do for the Tarte
shaped a
it's time for a little bit of contouring
to add some definition into the face so
for the high-end side I'm going to be
using the Fanta Beauty match stick and
this isn't shade amber this is such a
nice cool toned contour stick on this
retails for 21 pounds which is a little
bit on the pricey side so I have a
drugstore alternative and that is the
Maybelline duo stick this is actually
called the v-shape duo stick contour and
highlight because yeah actually has two
ends I'm sure you guys are familiar with
this product I use it quite a lot
so the reason why I think this is a dupe
for this is because they both have that
cool toned contour shade to them whereas
a lot of drugstore products actually
have a really warm toned kind of color
so first up let's take the fenty Beauty
contour stick and just apply it in all
the usual places where I contour like my
cheekbone my temple and my forehead and
then also a little bit on the side of
the nose and then we're gonna take the
maybelline one as well and just
basically do the same so I'm contouring
the cheekbone the forehead temple and
also the side of that nose gonna get
that low snatched already if you look at
both of these kanto sticks on my face
they literally look identical it looks
as if I've applied one product that's
the same the colors are just so cool
toned which I absolutely love so to get
a fair test of the contour I actually
have two of the same brushes by NYX so
I'm just going to use one to blend out
this side and use the other to blend out
this side this literally blends out like
a dream I absolutely love the fenty
Beauty sticks I'm now gonna go into the
other side with the other brush and just
blend that in as well oh my goodness
literally this blends out exactly as
well as the Fenty Beauty one which is
actually ridiculous because it's like
almost half the price if anything the
maybelline one actually blends out even
better and this is the finished result
absolutely loving both of these
obviously if you can't splurge on the
Fanta Beauty one you can obviously opt
for the maybelline one which is so great
now I'm gonna set everything into place
so that it doesn't budge so for the high
inside I have my mac studio fix powder
this retails for 20 for 50 and the dupe
for it is the Rimmel stay matte powder
which is honestly such a staple piece in
like every teenagers bag and the best
thing about it is that its own
$3.99 which is literally just incredible
I'm just gonna apply each one to each
side or with two different brushes so
that it's a fair test of course and now
I'm going to use the Rimmel powder as
well now moving on to blush Alysha have
found the best dupe for the Too Faced
sweetheart blusher this is in shade love
a hangover I'm pretty sure this is what
it looks like this you guys retails for
twenty five pounds which obviously is
quite pricey for a blusher so I
literally found the best dupe for this
at the drugstore which literally looks
the same on the skin that once it's
applied and that is the nutty London
blush crush in shade Zee I've actually
broken the compact on it but they are
literally it's so close so this is 25
pounds and this is three pounds 70
because it's actually on sale right now
it's super drug so I mean get yourself
one so first up I'm gonna apply it this
one to this side and it is just such a
beautiful color I love this and then I'm
gonna take the Lottie London blusher and
apply it with a different brush so
obviously we get a fair test and just
apply it to the left hand side I mean
come on Alicia it looks like the same
block okay moving on to highlighter I am
so excited for this one because this is
honestly my favorite high-end
highlighter that I found a drugstore
dupe for and that is the Becca
moon stone highlighter so this retails
for 15 pounds now I've found a
three-pound dupe at the drugstore which
is by mu a now I have to say if you walk
past this in a super drug you'd never
think that this would resemble moonstone
by Becca because they just look so
different in the pan but once you swatch
them let me tell you they literally are
so close in color so firstly I'm gonna
take moonstone Becker and I'm gonna
apply that onto the high-end side this
is honestly one of my go-to highlighters
that I've been wearing so often recently
but now I'm gonna take the MUA one on a
different brush and just apply that on
to the other side and let me just tell
you this is this is something you guys I
don't know if it's actually showing up
on camera that much but it is so
beautiful again it's really finely
milled which is so difficult to find at
the drugstore I feel like because most
highlighters at the drugstore are
like glittery and chunky next up I'm
gonna move on to eyebrows so for the
high-end side we've got the Anastasia
brow definer which is retailing for 24
pounds and for the drugstore side I'm
gonna be using the NYX eyebrow definer
which only retails for 8 pounds let's
watch both of these on my hand they
literally are the same shade and they
have the same formula as well I really
really love both of these but honestly
if you don't have the money to splurge
on an eyebrow product just pick this one
up because it's so good I really like
the Anastasi one because it's so cool
toned and I hate my brows looking like
really warm because obviously compared
to my hair my hair's quite cool toned as
well it just looks really really stupid
and now for the drugstore side I'm just
gonna be taking the NYX one and just
literally filling in any sparse areas of
my brow this one literally glides on
like a dream like it's actually really
really easy to use and I find that it's
actually a little bit creamier than the
Anastasi one which is definitely a
little bit easier to work with
okay so brows are done they literally
look identical I can't even tell the
difference can you guys now I'm gonna
move on to the eyes I'm really excited
for this actually because I have found
such a good dupe for a really popular
palette by urban decay and that is the
naked heat palette you guys I'm sure
you've heard of this already this
retails for of 3950 now for the
drugstore side I have this one which is
so similar I mean obviously there's
quite a lot of difference in packaging
and stuff but once you really look at
the shades there are so many good dupes
in this palette for this palette so this
palette is by revolution it's called the
reloaded neutrals at - honestly this is
such a good dupe and it's only four
pounds okay so I'm gonna start off with
my high inside so I'm gonna take my
naked heat palette and I'm gonna go for
quite a orangie smoky sort of makeup
look the first up I'm gonna take the
shade at chaser
and just use that as like a transition
color through my crease I love the Urban
Decay palette they're so good and I feel
like it's definitely one of those
palettes that's kind of like become a
staple in the beauty industry and then
I'm gonna take the shade sourced which
is and this one right here it's a little
bit more of an orange kind of color and
I'm gonna kind of pop that all over the
lid and just
blend it out into the transition color
and then gonna take the shade lie blow
and just use this throughout the crease
to kind of deepen up that look I'm then
gonna take the shade it's scorched which
is this one here it's like a very pretty
shimmery burnt orange sort of color this
is such a beautiful color I love it and
I love the fact that there isn't that
she no fallout with this eyeshadow
palette either so now let's take the
drugstore alternative and recreate this
same life so first up I'm gonna take
this shade right here which I feel like
is the closest to the transition color
that we used from the heat pallet and
again I'm gonna take that one a new
brush and just kind of pop that through
the crease to replicate the same look
and then gonna take the color next to it
to pop all over the lid and kind of
blend into the crease same way we did on
this eye oh my god so far this is a
literally looking identical and I have
to say with the revolution palette you
get such good payoff for the price you
pay is you actually get 15 different
shades and the pans of each of the
eyeshadow are actually quite big
compared to you in the Urban Decay
palette where you only get twelve shades
and the pans are a lot of thinner as
well however with the Urban Decay
palette you are obviously paying for a
more luxurious formula of eyeshadow
there are a lot more creamy than these
ones however they do feel a little bit
more chalky and you do get the
occasional fallout every now and again
and lastly we're gonna take at this
shade right here and kind of mix it with
this one as well to make the perfect
shade of scorched that we use from the
heat pallet for like the very lid of our
eye so now that the eye shadow is
finished we can move on to the eyeliner
now for the high inside I'm gonna be
using the YSL Couture eyeliner this
retails for 25 pounds which again is
quite expensive for an eyeliner but I
have a drugstore gee but which is the
collection eyeliner this only retails
for $2.99 the reason why I think that
this is quite a good dupe for this is
because they have the same applicator
obviously the formula is gonna be a
little bit different it's not gonna be
exactly the same I mean you are paying a
lot more for this product right here
they both have a very thin applicator so
first up I've got my wire eyeliner and
I'm just gonna do at my regular winged
liner with this so this is the YSL
winged liner I honestly have to say this
is one of my favorite like high-end
eyeliners it has lasted me a long time
I've had this for quite a few months now
and it hasn't dried out yes I mean that
does say something
you are definitely paying a lot more for
the formula the finish and how long it
lasts but I have also used the
collection eyeliner for quite some time
as well since I was a teenager basically
so I do really like this one and I can
vouch that it lasts for a long time it's
very black it's very pigmented
that's the eyeliner done literally I see
no difference whatsoever in appearance
obviously we're gonna see how it wears
but I mean look unless who looks no
different now for the sky I have a very
good dupe for the Too Faced better than
sex mascara which is literally
everyone's favorite this retails like
nineteen fifty on the UK websites now
for the drugstore side I have this one
right here which only retails for $11.99
and this is the L'Oreal Paris paradise
ecstatic
mascara now this is the reason why I say
that they're a close group the ones are
practically identical so first I'm gonna
take the Too Faced better than sex
mascara this again is one of my favorite
like cult favorite mascaras I love love
love it now I'm gonna take it the
L'Oreal mascara and just apply a few
coats of that onto my lashes wow this
mascara I've forgotten how good this is
actually it gives the lashes a very
similar effect the two-faced mascara
because it makes them like a really
thick almost a little bit clumpy if you
apply more than one layer so that is my
mascara finished as you can see the
effect are just so so close in
appearance but now I'm gonna move on to
my lip liner I actually don't have a
dupe for early applying this a day
unfortunately so I'm just gonna end up
using one for the whole lip the one I'm
gonna be using is the Maybelline X Gigi
Hadid lip liner I think this isn't shade
of Tora but a high-end I have the Tarte
lip paint in shades
salty now as a dupe of this I have the
maybelline superstay matte ink in shade
poet this is 15 pounds or as this is
only $9.99 obviously the price point
isn't that much different but I feel
like you get a lot more product in this
one and obviously a Maybelline is such
an accessible brand worldwide
whereas this you would have to get
online if you live in the UK because we
don't have tar in the UK so I'm gonna go
ahead and just apply the Tarte lip paint
first on the right hand side which is my
high inside and then of course gonna
take at the drugstore side which is the
Maybelline one and this is the finished
look I honestly love how this tone
I feel like everything looks identical
if you look to my face right now you
would not be able to tell that I'm
wearing two different products on each
side of the face for literally
everything overall I feel like this
makeup just says you guys really don't
have to spend so much money on high-end
makeup is not necessary drugstore makeup
has really stepped up their game I mean
look at this but anyways I really want
to put this makeup to the test to really
see which side is gonna be more
long-lasting which side is gonna wear
quicker I'm just gonna check in with you
guys after a few hours of eating
drinking all that good stuff to really
see how this makeup is gonna last on my
skin so I'm gonna head off right now and
I'll see you guys in a little bit hey
hey guys so I am back it has probably
been like five hours or so I've had my
dinner now it's around 10 o'clock at the
moment I've basically just come to check
in with you guys to see how my makeup is
holding up from afar it actually looks
still really good from up close however
that's a different story
so my lipstick is the first thing I
noticed and half of it has kind of
started to crumble off I don't know if
you guys can see that but it's kind of
like or come off on the inner part of my
mouth but more so towards the high-end
side interestingly enough I didn't
actually think this will happen I
thought the drugstore side would be less
longer-lasting but actually the
drugstore side still looks really good I
mean obviously I pop from the inner part
of the mouth but it's holding up pretty
well now let's take a look at the under
eye creases I feel like they're always
pretty bad but on this occasion they're
as bad as each other so I mean there's
not really too much difference maybe
this one is a little bit worse but to be
fair there's not that much difference
happening for the foundation overall so
I mean look at this there's quite a lot
of blemishes coming through from the
high-end side so you can literally see
all of my spots through so I feel like
the luminous silk actually isn't that
long-lasting however it doesn't make
your skin look beautiful when you first
apply it now this is the drugstore side
and I mean come on there's only one
little blemish there and everything else
is pretty conceal brows look the same
eyes look almost the same but I feel
like there's a little bit more wearing
on the drugstore side I feel like the
pigmentation is not quite there anymore
and surprisingly enough this highlight
is pretty much all gone however the MUA
is still really really vibrant on my
face that's actually really surprising
because I love the moonstone highlight
by Becker but it seems that this one is
actually a little bit longer lasting so
yeah this is the makeup after five to
six sort of hours honestly I'm actually
really really surprised of how well
everything's lasted on my face
everything is still looking really good
I'm only like nitpicking at all the
little small things this video was
definitely very eye-opening so I'm
really really glad I did that I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did make
sure you smash that use thumbs up just
