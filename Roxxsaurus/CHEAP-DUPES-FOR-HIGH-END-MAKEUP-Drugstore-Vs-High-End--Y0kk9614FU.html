channel I hope you guys are all well
today as you can tell from the title I'm
doing yet another drugstore busses
high-end makeup tutorial this is the
makeup look that I've created today and
I want you guys to tell me which side
you think is the drug spot in which side
you think is the high-end go go go write
down your comments below right now don't
cheat hmm which side is niche so the
drugstore side is actually my right side
and this is the high-end side but
honestly I don't think you can tell like
they look pretty much identical so if
you guys only see the Dukes that I've
come up with for the high-end products
then keep on watching this video and be
sure to give it a like as well but helps
me out so much let's try to get this
video to 20,000 likes that would be
really cool follow that Barbie this is
your face of the video so first up is
foundation for my high-end side I'm
using the Born This Way by Too Faced and
I absolutely love this foundation it's
very high in coverage I would say but
it's not too mattifying or too dewy I
would say it's a very nice compromise in
between the two formulas and for my
drugstore side I'm using the fit me
foundation by Maybelline I have been a
fan of this foundation for so long and I
feel like the consistency of this
foundation is quite similar to the one
of Born This Way Foundation honestly I
can't really tell the difference between
the two but the price point does vary
quite a lot
up next is concealer now I have to say
these two concealers aren't the closest
concealers that I own I don't actually
own many high-end concealers but these
two to me were quite similar because
they are both cream now there is a big
gap between the price point and you
probably will be able to tell by how
long the concealers actually stay on
your skin and the way they look on the
skin is also quite similar because they
both have color correcting properties
however due to the price one probably
does last much longer than the other I'm
not moving on TV console slash bronzer
i'm using Bahama Mama by the balm this
is one of my signature bronzers I love
this bronzer so much it's so cool toned
it's not shimmery it's very mattifying
and it just looks very natural on the
skin and likewise the models own bronzer
looks very similar on the skin although
the shade does vary slightly in the pan
however when it's applied to the skin it
looks pretty much the same moving on to
blush on my high-end side I'm using Mac
super continental and my deep for this
is the circum Glory rosy cheek blush
it's very just very slightly in pigment
because one is a little bit more Pinker
than the other but overall when they are
applied to the cheek I think they look
very similar
lastly for the skin the highlight I'm
using for my high inside is Too Faced
chocolate bunny this is actually a
bronzer but I find it to be more of a
highlight and for my drugstore site I'm
using the 17 shimmer brick by the way I
just noticed that there's a lot of
two-faced products in this video this is
completely unintentional I just really
love Too Faced products at the moment
and as you can see the glow on both of
the sides of my cheekbones are just very
very similar they're really gold in
color up next on the eyes on my high-end
side I'm using Too Faced chocolate bar
palette again to face sorry guys and for
my drugstore side I'm using the NYX warm
neutrals palette as you can tell in
price the difference is huge however
they both have the same amount of colors
now the colors aren't a perfect match
but I found that some of the colors are
pretty much the same
so firstly I'm taking the shade truffled
from the semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette and I'm popping that into the
crease as a transition shade and now I'm
doing the same for the other side using
the equivalent shadow from the NYX
palette I'm now reaching for the shade
bonbon from the semi-sweet palette and
I'm applying this to the center of my
eyelid on the moving part of my lid I'm
now reaching for my next palette and I'm
using the third shadow down and doing
the same thing on the other lid now to
finish off the eyes I'm reaching for
pudding and I'm just applying this into
the crease to kind of add even more
depth to that area and I'm then reaching
for the NYX palette once again and using
the last shadow of the palette and
repeating the same thing to the other
side
I'm also pulling those shadows along the
lower lash line to complete the whole
look together now moving on to mascara
from my high end I'm using the Too Faced
better than sex mascara and for my
drugstore I'm using Kiko Milano and the
sky volume mascara
although the applicators are a little
bit different I feel like they both give
off the same volume eyes defect and I've
been loving both of these mascaras
recently but they are very different in
price so I thought I would share that
with you guys and if you can't afford
the toothpaste one the Kiko Milano is a
great option
moving on to the lips for my high-end
line I am using Kylie cosmetics Dolce K
lipliner and on my drugstore side I'm
using Barry M lipliner in shade toast I
have found that these liners are very
similar in shade of course the
consistency of this product is a little
bit different as we all know the Kylie
lip liners are very very creamy in
consistency and although the Burien one
is very creamy still I don't think it
measures up to the Kylie cosmetics wand
but for the price I don't feel you can
fault it and lastly for the lips I have
to say right off the bat that this isn't
the cheapest dupe for the Kylie
cosmetics Dolce K lipstick I have found
that two faced melted chocolate in
chocolate honey is pretty much the same
in shade
although the two-faced one is more
expensive in pounds I think it's
probably a less hassle to get the
two-faced option if you are living in
the UK because of course on the Kylie
lip kit you have to pay for customs and
all that kind of stuff
so although it is more expensive for the
product I feel like it's still more
accessible to everyone they've both dry
matte although the Kylie lip kit does
dry a little bit more matte so you have
to bear that in mind as well so that is
all for my dupe / I don't know what I'm
saying drugstore versus high-end makeup
I hope you guys enjoyed this look I'm
loving it and I hope you guys liked
finding out some dupes for hand products
because honestly you don't need the most
expensive products all the time I mean
it's nice to splurge on some items but
so you can really find a very good
alternative at the drugstore so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video be sure to
give it a huge thumbs up for me let's
try and get this vid
