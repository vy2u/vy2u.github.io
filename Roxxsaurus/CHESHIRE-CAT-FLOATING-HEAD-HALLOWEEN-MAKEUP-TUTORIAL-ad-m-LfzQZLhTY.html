hey guys welcome back to my channel I
hope you guys are having an awesome day
so far so in today's video as you guys
can probably tell by the title and the
look I'm gonna be doing a Cheshire cat
inspired and makeup tutorial for
Halloween this Cheshire cat is inspired
by the original Alice in Wonderland
movie and I also have a little bit of a
hovering net going on which is pretty
fancy but this look today I actually
used a bunch of Cod beauty products that
you can find on their website but I
actually have a little bit of a surprise
for you guys
so coal beauty is actually giving you a
chance to win all of these products that
I'm about to use in this video which let
me just add they're absolutely amazing
basically to enter we have to do is just
regram and the photo of this look over
on my instagram at rocks or us and then
you also just have to follow cob duty on
instagram and that is literally it I
also actually have a little bit of a
discount code for you guys which I'll
have on screen right now which it just
gives you 15% off when you spend over 25
pounds but without refer you if you guys
want to see how to achieve this makeup
look and then let's get on into the
video so to start off this makeup I'm
gonna be using the Becca blurring primer
and I'm just gonna apply that all over
my face to get a nice even and smooth
base for all of the makeup that we're
gonna apply later on now for foundation
I'm gonna use the Charlotte's he'll be
magic foundation using my black Beauty
Blender and I'm just gonna apply that in
dots all over my face and then really
blend this out with the Beauty Blender
I've actually recently started using
this foundation and it's definitely one
of my go-to s just because it's so high
in coverage and it just makes my skin so
flawless up next for concealer I'm gonna
be using the aqua luminous perfecting
concealer I really like this concealer
because it doesn't crease too much
underneath the eyes so it's perfect for
a Halloween look because you're gonna be
Wagner's makeup all night so you
definitely don't want it to crease now
to set everything in place I'm gonna use
the NYX HD powder this is a translucent
one and I'm just gonna apply this with
my Beauty Blender all over my face now
moving on to brows I'm gonna be using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills a brow
pencil this pencil has a little bit of a
triangle shaped edge to which I find
that quite interesting it's something
definitely a little bit different but I
feel like it was really super easy to
use I can already tell this is gonna be
one of my favorite brow products now
that your brows are done and we can move
on to contouring so I'm gonna be
reaching for the Anastasio contour kit
this is the powder one and I'm using the
shades I'm just gonna use this to kind
of scoped out my cheeks and make them a
little bit more defined next up I'm
gonna take the NYX sweet cheeks at cheek
palette and I'm just gonna be taking the
bright pink blush from this and just
kind of contouring further with that so
I'm gonna extend that blush all the way
up into my temples I'm also gonna add
some to the tip of my nose and also my
temple in my forehead just to really tie
that whole pink enos together using that
same blush shadow I'm also gonna pop
this into my crease as a bit of a
transition color just as a slight hint
of pink for all of the shadows to blend
into a later on moving on i'm taking
this nyx black gel liner and i'm just
outlining where my mouth is gonna be so
we're creating the really evil looking
Cheshire Cat mouth so I'm just outlining
this really carefully I'm extending it
quite far to the sides as well and also
creating a little bit of a cult to make
the smile look more twisted and evil
once I've done my initial outline I'm
gonna go over this with my NYX liquid
liner in black and I'm just literally
going over this and also starting to
create the teeth so for the teeth you
just want to create bigger triangles I
have no other way to explain this but
this is exactly what you want to do and
as you're going further away from the
center you want to start making the
teeth smaller and smaller as you can see
I'm doing here now on the bottom you
want to make the teeth kind of go into
the other ones if you think about how my
mouth would close you kind of want the
teeth to fit together like a puzzle if
that makes any sense now to fill the
mouth in I'm taking my NYX jumbo eye
pencil in black and I'm just literally
going into the hollows of the teeth and
just creating that really pigmented
black I absolutely love using the jumbo
pencils because they're so pigmented and
really easy to use because of the
precise and small tip and now for the
actual teeth I'm gonna be taking the
white jumbo eye pencil and just
literally going over the triangles
trying to really carefully stay within
the lines but of course you can clean
this up afterwards even if you do go
over the line I'm then taking the next
liquid liner in white and I'm just going
over the teeth once again but creating a
little bit of a highlight to the teeth
to make them look a little bit more
three-dimensional and just pop out from
the face a little bit more now moving on
to the eyes I'm going to be using the
hütter Beauty textured shadows palette
so I'm gonna be taking and the pink
shadow which is called Flamingo and I'm
just gonna apply this all over the
with a big packing brush you want this
to be as pigmented as you possibly can
get it and I'm also going to pull that
across at the bottom lashline as well
just to tie the whole look together next
up I'm gonna take the shade bossy which
is like a slightly darker kind of
purpley color and I'm just gonna apply
this on my lower lash line at the outer
edges of my eyes next I'm taking the NYX
a white jumbo eye pencil once again and
I'm just applying this onto my inner
corners and then also going over this
with the white liquid liner I'm using
this white liquid liner to create a lot
of highlighting to the face I'm just
adding that to the tip of my nose also
around the mouth and just smudging it
out with my finger I feel like this adds
a little bit more detail and just makes
it look so much more three-dimensional
returning back to that jumbo NYX pencil
I'm also going to pop that on the bridge
of my nose just to make my face look a
little bit more animalistic and almost
cat-like and taking that same pencil I'm
just gonna add a little bit on to my
brow bone as a pop of highlight now
returning back to the black liquid liner
from NYX I'm just going to create a
really sharp and cat-like wing I know a
lot of people struggle with eyeliners a
lot but this is honestly so easy with
this eyeliner because the wand is just
so easy to control so then I'm just
gonna repeat the same thing to the other
eye and then it's time to move on to the
lashes so for this I'm gonna be using
this Stila huge extreme lash mascara the
wand of this is so thick so it really
makes your lashes so volumize so I'm
just gonna apply this to the top and
bottom of my lashes and then I'm gonna
finish off my lashes with some falsies
so I'm using these harder Beauty lashes
in Sasha 11 I absolutely love how wispy
they are I think they've really complete
the look so well and that is the face
makeup finish we can now move on to the
neck this is the part that's gonna make
people kind of woozy and it's kind of
gonna freak them out so this is the
hovering neck I've done a tutorial on
this two years ago when I first came up
with the idea and I absolutely love this
so if you guys want to really in-depth
tutorial of how I did this I'll link it
down below as well but basically what
this is is just an illusion a trick of
the eye so you want to create like an
oval shape on your neck this is gonna
kind of look like a stump as if your
neck has been cut off and then you just
want to connect that circle to your
shoulders to make it look as if it's
part of your body we're going to take
the black jumbo pencil and fill in the
hole of the negative space of our
so basically where we cut off the
shoulders and also the neck you want
that whole portion to be black when you
get to the oval shape you want to leave
a slither of skin just at the top of
that to maintain at the shape of the
circle so you don't want to completely
get rid of that once you've filled
everything in black you want to take the
white liquid liner and just outline the
very top edge of the circle as you can
see I'm doing here now for the neck
instead of leaving it plain I actually
wanted to create a bit of a Cheshire cat
stripe inspired by the Cheshire Cat so
I'm going to be taking the white jumbo
NYX crayon and I'm just gonna create a
line like a stripe across the top of the
neck and then also use the pink crayon
to create another stripe and then a
white one to create another stripe now
for some last finishing touches on the
face I'm gonna take the liquid liner
from NYX and create a very thin liner
just underneath my brows a little bit of
a highlight and I'm also gonna take the
black liner and just create some short
little whiskers on my cheeks now to
complete the look you want to pop on a
some black cape or a hoodie or a coat as
you can see I'm doing here this is
really going to complete the hovering
neck look and it's gonna freak some
people out so this is the finished
Cheshire cat makeup look I really hope
you guys enjoy it if you did make sure
you smash that huge thumbs up just down
below it kind of looks a little bit
weird when I talk but when I have my
mouth shut
it looks so creepy this look is
absolutely perfect for Halloween parties

same time if you guys want to shop at
