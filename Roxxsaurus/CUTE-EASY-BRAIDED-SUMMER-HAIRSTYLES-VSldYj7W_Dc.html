channel I hope you guys all well today
I've got a summer hairstyle video for
you guys I haven't done a hairstyle for
a few weeks now so I thought it's about
time to do another one so I thought I
would film like an easy kind of summer
hairstyles video so that one is really
hot you guys just want to get your hair
out of your face you can use these
hairstyles and they're super quick and
super simple to do if you guys enjoy my
hair style video be sure to give it a
thumbs up so I know and subscribe to
this channel as well as my blog channel
if you undo and if you don't follow me
on my social media I think you should so
my Twitter Instagram and snapchat rocks
will restate wait stop here but without
overdo let's jump right into the
tutorial so the first hairstyle is a
really easy one it's a fishtail top knot
it looks quite hard to do but it's
actually really really simple so the
first thing you want to do is flip your
head over and put all of your hair up
into a high ponytail
once you have your hair up in a high
ponytail you can tug on the hair around
your scalp just to kind of add a little
bit of volume in this section over here
and if you want you to also pull out
some sections while you is just to frame
the face a little bit better and now
what we want to do is that taking a
chunk of hair on the outer strand and
crossing it over to the next side so I'm
taking a strand of hair from the outer
side placing it over and on to the other
side once again I'm taking another
strand of hair from the outer side and
placing it over into the middle there's
no break are super simple once you get
the hang of it so this is what it should
somewhat look like and now you just want
to tug on each part of the breaks you
kind of widen it and make it more
volumized once you are happy with how it
looks all there is enough to do is to
actually fold this into a bun and I'm
then securing that in place with some
hair grips this is what the final hair
so looks like I think it's such a cute
spin on a regular top one and XS out if
I hop up to half down do and it's a
really cute one to get your hair out on
your Facebook so simple so first I'm
going to be taking a chunk of hair on my
right side and I'm going to start
braiding this in a Dutch braid so what
you want to do is separate the shrimp
head into three sections like this and
then you want to take the Strand on the
back and place it underneath the middle
strand take this strand from the front
and place that underneath as well so
basically this is like a normal braid
exception of braiding or invite your
braiding under
and once you get to the bottom of your
braid simply tie it together with a
clear elastic tie and now what you want
to do is basically repeat the same thing
to the other side now that you've got
your two braids you want to take them to
the back of your head and tie these
together and once you have attached your
braids together can release at the
bottoms of your braid so that it just
blends naturally into the rest of your
hair this is the final hair so I think
it's super cute it kind of reminds me of
Game of Thrones a little bit I think
this is just a really nice way to get
your hair off your face while still
having your hair down and this last hair
some take a section at the front of your
hair and this is the section that we're
not actually going to be touching at all
so today we're going to be leaving this
section out and we're going to be
focusing on this section here so I'm
taking a chunk of hair from the middle
section of my head and I'm going to
start braiding this in a Dutch braid
where I'm crossing the first section
underneath the middle section I'm taking
the last strand and crossing that
underneath the middle section once again
then I'm going to add a chunk of hair to
the existing strand and also add that
into the braid and also from the other
side just behind the braid
once we get to RTL which is going to
start bringing the rest of the hair
without adding any more strands once you
get to the end of the braid you just
want to secure it with a clear elastic
tie you don't want to take a chunk of
hair from the back of your head and just
backcomb this a little bit to add some
extra volume now what you want to do is
take all of your hair that isn't braided
and fold this into a ponytail so it
should look something like this and now
you want to take this braid and start
putting your tools the back of your head
and wrap it around the ponytail
once your break is secured you want to
take the front section of the hair that
we have left out and you want to start
writing this another fishtail braid once
your fishtail braid is complete you once
you've repeat the same step take your
braid to the back of your head and hide
this underneath the ponytail and this is
what the finished hairstyle should look
like I think it's such a cute way to
spice up a regular ponytail but these
two braids and it's not how to do at all
so those are my 3 easy summer hairstyles
I hope you guys enjoyed them and if you
