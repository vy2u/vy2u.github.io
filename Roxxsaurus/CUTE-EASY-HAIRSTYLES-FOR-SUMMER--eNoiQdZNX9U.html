is a hair tutorial I'm going to be
showing you guys how to achieve a four
different hair styles that are for the
summer and summer is here I am so
excited to be putting my hair up more
often and just having a little bit more
fun with my hair you guys enjoy these

maybe even two and I am so excited
there's going to be so many amazing
daily vlogs before my holiday which you
guys should definitely check out so make
sure you guys are subscribed to rocks or
as blogs too but when that's over adieu
let's get on into the hairstyles okay so
for the side pestle I'm going to be
separating my hair into a slightly more
of a side parting now I have a bit more
of a side parting what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take this a first
section of my hair just at the top and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
separate this into three sections like
so and then start braiding this with a
regular braid
as I upgraded my braids once or twice
what I'm going to do is I'm actually
going to leave out a section of the
braid and let it kinda loose with the
rest of my hair there's some very to
create a slight waterfall effect and
what we're going to do is we're going to
grab a section just from underneath it
to replace about strand from the braid
I'm going to grab it sections of the top
as well and just kind of incorporate
this into the braid as well and every
now and again I'm just going to let this
stranded hedge of tangles and replace it
with another strand by taking a chunk of
hair from underneath there I'm going to
leave another strand of hair just here
and let it loose and then pick up
another section just from underneath
there once that's done you then just
wanna secure that into the back of your
hair with a bobby pin and this is the
finished hairstyle I think it's so cute
it really gets to a hair out of your
face while still having your hair down
if you don't really fancy putting your
hair up
I think this hairstyle would work on
hair that wavy curly or even straight
and you'll have no problem retreating
the test out so now we can move on to
hairstyle number two so for the second
hair so you're going to need to separate
your hair into a middle parting like so
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to just pull out a few sections of
hair by my face just to kind of leave
that out of the hairstyle and frame my
face a little bit better once that's
done I'm going to pick the first side of
my hair and I'm going to kind of put
this up into a side ponytail like this
now that one side is up you don't want
to just repeat the same thing to the
other side I think this is actually a
pretty cute hairstyle just on its own I
absolutely love like Carly pigtail pin
spoke you but we are going to turn this
into two little buns on the side of my
head so once your buns are pinned in
place and what you can do is just
continue to pull out any chunks of hair
just by your face just to make this
hairstyle a little bit more messy and
undone and this will also at frame your
face just that tiny bit better and this
is the finished hair so I think the
pencil is so cute I love the fact that
you get your hair like completely out of
your face and off of your neck
especially when it's like super hot you
really do not want your hair down
I think the Purcell is like so much
humbler but I really love I think it's a
really really cute now we can be bungee
hairstyle number three now moving on to
the third hairstyle what I'm going to do
is I'm going to flip my head over and
just gather up all of my hair into a
high ponytail so now that my hair is in
a high ponytail what I'm going to do is
I'm going to separate my ponytail into
two sections that are like so and I'm
actually going to start braiding this
with a fishtail braid for those of you
who don't know how to fishtail braid all
you have to do is take a thin strand of
one side of the sections and cross it
over into the middle of the other side
you don't want to do the same thing from
the other side so I'm taking a section
of hair and I'm cutting this over into
the other side you want to keep doing
this this process is kind of tedious and
long but once you get the hang of it you
guys are going to be pros oh this
so once again is a very important of the
braid what you want to do is just tie
off the end with a clear elastic tire
like so and then what you can do is
actually pull apart the braid to make it
even more volumized and messy now that
your braid is super volumize that what
you can do is just start twisting this
around into a bun like so and this is
the finished hairstyle I absolutely am
in love with the bun it's just such a
nice way to spice up a regular topknot
burner by just adding a little bit of
detail in there I think the texture is
perfect for summer is so adorable or my
head is getting more volumizing and
volumize has this video goes on okay so
the last hairstyle that I'm going to do
for today is actually a really simple
one is going to be so quick to do when
you just want to like throw some of your
hair up so what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to pop my hair back into
a middle parting so again the first
thing you want to do is take a few
chunks of hair just and by your face and
leave this out of the hairstyle because
these are gonna frame your face you then
want to take the top part of your hair
just from each side and gather this to
the back of your head now once you have
your hair secured added back you just
want to tie it off with a hair tie and
once your little ponytail is secured you
want to take one strand of that ponytail
and just wrap this around the actual
hair tie to conceal it and you then want
to pin that in place with a hair grip
and this is the finished hairstyle again
I absolutely love this one because it's
so easy and simple to do it does conceal
the Harrow which is kind of like a
little extra step that you can do to
make it look a little bit more put
together
I absolutely love this because of how
quick and easy it is to recreate so
those were all in my summer hairstyles I
really hope you guys enjoyed them and if
