filming it this spring inspired makeup
look and I'm using all drugstore
products so this is going to be super
accessible and affordable for all of you
if you guys enjoyed this video please
don't forget to leave me a thumbs up it
helps me out so so much and don't forget
to subscribe if you're not subscribed
already please feel free to follow me on
any of my social media my Twitter
Instagram and snapchat are all rocks or
a same way it's about here so yeah if
you guys would like to see how I
achieved this really sweet and spring
inspired makeup look then just keep
watching so the first thing I'm going to
start off with is primer and the one I
having a loving recently is the L'Oreal
Paris studio secrets professional
I actually want this not too long ago
and I tried it in stores as soon as I
squashed on my hand all the lines on my
hand were like completely gone so I was
like oh my god I need to try this so I'm
just going to pop that on underneath my
eyes over my cheeks and like any
problematic areas on my skin that tend
to be quite dry next I'm just going to
color correct my skin a little bit as
you can see I've got a little red spot
here and also my under eye circles so
I'm just going to be using the anyway
Pro base foam and conceal just to kind
of color correct my skin a little bit so
for any blemishes on my skin I'm going
to be using the green concealer and this
is gonna cancel out any redness on my
skin next I'm going to get in with this
orange tone concealer here that's gonna
go underneath my eye area to conceal any
dark circles now for my base I'm going
to be using the bodyshop fresh nude
foundation and this is in shade Bali
vanilla zero to zero I think it's a
really nice formula for this spring
because it's quite moisturizing when
your skin is still quite dry from the
winter season and it gives you that
really nice gooey glowy look and to
apply this I'm going to be using my
Maybelline um little sponge I don't know
what this is called it looks really
dirty but I have washed our promise if
you guys own a beauty
you know the struggle of how difficult
it is to actually clean them but they
are amazing so we keep using them anyway
so I'm just going to kind of dug this
underneath my eyes first now for the fun
part I'm going to be using my foundation
the same one I used for my base to
actually contour calm down I know you're
all excited so bodyshop have recently
launched the shade adjusting drops and
here I've got the darkening shade and
the lightening shape so using these is
really simple all you have to do is add
a tiny drop of each to your foundation
to achieve your contour and highlight
shade so I'm going to do a little
demonstration for those of you who are
confused so basically if you just squirt
your regular foundation onto your hand
like this and then you just take your
darkening shades and basically what you
have to do is dab a little drop onto
your hand like so and same with your
lighting drops you just add a little
tiny drop you don't need a lot at all
and then all you have to do is literally
mix these two together and it creates
darker and lighter shades so I'm
whipping out my trusty Real Techniques
foundation brush for this and I'm going
to be applying in the lighter shade
first to use as highlighting I think
this is such an amazing product like
when you think about it you don't have
to go out and buy like a whole palette
for contouring or like a contouring kit
you don't you just use your foundation
and add these drops whenever you like
and because you need like the tiniest
amount this product will literally last
you forever so I'm placing this product
underneath my eyes in like a triangular
motion to further conceal the eye as
well as highlight and lift the cheekbone
also going to add some to the tip of my
nose and down the bridge of my nose so I
could now blend this out but I'm going
to wait until I use my contour shade
just because I like how weird my
contouring marks look so then I'm just
going in with the same brush and using
the contour shade and just placing the
contour in the usual kind of contour
places so underneath my cheekbones on
the sides of my forehead and tell all by
the way even all my hair like I try to
tone it and dye it I did at home
as always which I should know and my
hair probably has a thousand different
colors in it right now you guys need to
remind you not to ever dye my hair at
home again oh so now my cult is done I
can now blend this all out where is my
sponge
where you at homie so I've got my dumped
new blender once again I'm just
literally going in with a pointy side
and blending everything together
I feel like using a few blender where
this is going to create the most natural
effect now for blush I'm going to be
using this L'Oreal sculpt blush and this
is the trio contour blush it shade soft
rosy 201 and lastly for the skin the
highlight that I'm gonna be using today
is this rosy for autograph highlighting
powder this Brown is by Marks &amp;amp;
Spencer's I believe it kind of still
classes as drugstore because it's like
high street makeup and then we just say
this highlight is absolutely amazing so
I'm using my Real Techniques contour
brush for this because I feel like it's
quite a nice size and then I'm just
applying this to the highest point of my
cheekbone that highlight I'd be poppin
I'm such a bad youtuber I haven't seen
my brushes before starting this video so
for the eye shadow I'm going to be using
this gorgeous revolution makeup palette
and these are like the drugstore dupes
of the Naked palette by urban decay and
to be honest for four pounds I think
these are really good quality so the
pilot I'm gonna music is called
Redemption palette iconic three and
these are the shades so there's quite a
lot of mattes and shimmers which is
great so because this palette doesn't
actually have any shadow knows I'm just
going to point to you which one I'm
using
so first I'm starting off with the full
shadow here which is a matte and dusty
rose color and I'm just gonna be placing
this into the crease as my transition
you guys know the drill and I'm going
over this topi shade which is the one
two three four five six seven this is
the seventh shutout in and again it's a
math so I'm going to be running that
freely crease again to just deepen up
the shadow I'm now going to be using
this pinky shimmer shadow which is just
going to go all over the moving part of
my lid and to apply this I'm using
rising over two three four brush next
i'm picking up the second shadow from
this palette and this shimmer pink is a
little bit lighter than this one so
we're going to be using this as a pop of
highlight in the center of our lid as
well as our inner corner i'm just going
to pop that directly into the center of
the lid so now return you back to that
fourth chain that i used first for my
crease also going to be driving that
into my lower lash line just to try the
whole look together so now to line my
eyes i'm using the loreal tip liner
perfect slim and this is a felt tip line
I'm just always amazing because it's
just really easy to use so now to finish
off the eye look I'm going in with my
Maybelline falsies push-up drama mascara
and now to finish off the eyes I'm just
going to be applying some false lashes
these are the demi wispies I can
remember will Brown they're from but
I'll list them down below in the
description and lastly for the lip I'm
using this Rimmel London cappucino lip
liner the last day of the lips I'm going
to be using the Rouge Edition velvet
lipstick by bourgeois and this is in
shade don't pink about it so this is my
final spring makeup look including all
