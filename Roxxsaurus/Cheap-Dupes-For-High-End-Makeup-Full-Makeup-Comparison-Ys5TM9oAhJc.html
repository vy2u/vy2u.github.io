channel today I'm going to be creating
this makeup look using drugstore vs.
high-end makeup so on one side of my
face I'm going to be using all high-end
makeup and on the other side I'm going
to be using a more affordable and
drugstore makeup this video is inspired
by my different here on YouTube could
Lela Rose if you guys want to check out
her video I'll link it down below and
without further ado let's just jump
right in so to start my makeup I'm going
to be reaching for two different primers
the affordable side is the L'Oreal
primer and the high-end side is the
Porefessional primer by benefit these
primers are two of my favorites and I
feel like they do literally the same
thing but one of course is much more
expensive than the other the
professional primer does have a skin
tint to it but I feel like that doesn't
really do much difference when they are
blended into the skin anyway next for
foundation on the affordable side I'm
using the fresh nude foundation by the
body shop and on the high-end side I'm
using the luminous silk by Giorgio
Armani so to apply them both I'm going
to be using their stippling brush by
Real Techniques and of course I am
cleaning the brush between the two sides
just to make it a fair test between the
foundations honestly these foundations
are very very similar to each other they
have that juhi lightweight consistency
and they are a medium coverage I feel
like the Giorgio Armani luminous surface
a slightly higher coverage but overall
they are very very similar even then
down to the shade now for concealer I
actually picked up the wrong products
for the high-end side I picked up the
mascara instead of can see like as the
packaging is so similar but for the
affordable side I'm using the Rimmel
wake me up concealer which is my
all-time favorite drugstore concealer
and on the high-end side I'm using the
toosha Clark by YSL and these are very
very similar in shade the YSL one again
is slightly more coverage but these were
the closest match that I have in my
collection although they're so different
in price they both have a very similar
coverage and they work perfectly for the
under-eye to conceal your dark circles
as you can see you can barely tell the
difference between the two sides now for
powder my affordable side I'm using the
Maybelline stay matte powder which is my
all-time favorite drugstore powder and
for the high-end side I'm using Mac
Studio Fix powder now these again very
similar they have that yellowy tinge to
it which is great for the under-eye to
kind of color correct
under eye bags moving on to the brows
for the affordable side I'm using brow
artery by soap &amp;amp; Glory which used to be
one of my favorite brow pencils ever and
for my high-end side I'm using at the
Urban Decay brow beater and these are so
so similar even in the way the packaging
is they both have a spoolie on the end
and the product is just so so similar
even in color as they are both cool
toned brown shades now onto our bronzer
for the bronzer on my affordable side
I'm using the l'oreal glam bronze
bronzer and on my high-end side I'm
using at the Too Faced milk chocolate
Soleil and shade light to medium and
these are very very similar again in
shade and they give you that really nice
seamless bronzed look that looks quite
natural and not overdone which I really
like and these are both slightly cool
toned which is always a good thing for a
natural seamless look now I'm super
excited for this next step because it's
a dupe of NARS orgasm and the affordable
version of this is the rose gold blush
by sleek this tube I actually found
myself one time and even though they
don't look too similar in the pan when
you apply it to the face they look
almost identical they both have that
rosy color with that slight shimmer of
gold in there your highlighter for my
affordable side I'm using the instant
glow by 17 and for my high-end side I'm
using the Dior shimmer powder as you can
see they are very close in color and
they give you that really nice and
bronzed and golden at highlight they
have a very similar formula which is why
I think that you are probably better off
buying the affordable side rather than
the high-end side I of course have both
and I can't really tell the difference
so if you want to save yourself some
money I would definitely opt for the
affordable version now for the star of
the show is the eye shadow so on the
affordable side I'm using the revolution
makeup palette and on the high-end side
I'm using the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette as you can see here they are so
similar the revolution palette literally
has a dupe for every single shade from
the Naked palette and of course the
affordable side is only four pounds
whereas the high-end side is about
thirty pounds or so so you will
definitely see some differences in the
lasting powers of these shadows however
for the pigment I can't actually fault
it I did find that with some of the
shadows the pigment did vary between the
two palettes for example in the
revolution palette
some of the shadows were more pigmented
than the high-end palate and vice-versa
so as you can see I'm applying this
golden copper shadow from the revolution
palette and in fact this was a much more
pigmented shadow than the equivalent
shadow from The Naked 3 palette called
trick so in terms of pigment I wouldn't
say that any of these palettes are
better than another but I definitely
think that The Naked 3 palette has much
more longer-lasting properties than a
cheaper alternative
moving on to eyeliner my affordable side
i'm using the l'oreal paris
super liner and for my high inside I'm
using the St Lauder
little black liner and honestly these
are pretty much identical the only
difference between these liners is that
the st daughter takes a little bit
longer to dry than the l'oreal paris one
they have the same finish same amount of
pigment and I would say that they have
the same lasting properties so once I
was looking through my makeup collection
the mascaras that I could find which
were quite close together was the soap &amp;amp;
Glory thick and fast and that's what I'm
applying on my affordable side and then
on the high inside I used the YSL 2
shiplap mascara they have a very similar
brush the bristles are quite thick so
these definitely make your lashes a lot
thicker and as you can see you can
barely tell the difference now for my
lip liner for the affordable side I'm
using this Rimmel London lip liner in
shade cappuccino and for my high inside
I'm using this Clarins lip liner in
shade Pauline honestly these are almost
identical in shade the only difference
is that the Rimmel cappuccino lip liner
is a little bit more pigmented and the
slightest bit darker but overall the
Rimmel one is a very close dupe to the
Clarins one now lastly for lipstick my
affordable side I'm using L'Oreal Paris
in sepia silk and the high-end side is a
blanket II by Mac this was quite hard
for me to find a lipstick that is quite
similar in shade from my collection but
I feel like these were the two closest
shades that I had to each other the only
difference is that in my opinion a
blankety is slightly lighter in color
than the L'Oreal lipstick but apart from
that they have the same finish and a
very similar formula
so that is all for my high-end vs. rug
store dupe video I hope you guys enjoyed
this and found it helpful I have to say
some of the products are really really
close to you so if you guys wanna save
yourself some money or you're on a
budget then definitely the drugstore
options are much more affordable than
the high-end options and some of them
are actually practically the same
product so you can't go wrong so that is
all from me I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I'll see you very soon
in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
