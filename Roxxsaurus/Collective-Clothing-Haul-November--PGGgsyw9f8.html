a collective clothing haul so that's
just a ribbon all of these clothes that
I'm going to show you are all online
sort of stores so I'm going to link all
of them down below so you can get them
yourself if you like them and I'm gonna
start off with we're gonna start off
with I'll start with and yct this is a
online store with clothes and I really
really love some of the pieces that they
have on there the first one is sort of
not very seasoned appropriate but I
really wanted it anyway and it's this
lovely sunflower crop top and it's
amazing I am obsessed with sunflowers as
you can probably tell and some power is
one of my favorite flowers so this is
just perfect and even though it's not
like sort of the weather to wear it I
will definitely be rocking this next
summer and maybe even on the less colder
days if I really really wrap this up
with loads of layers and some
high-waisted jeans maybe who knows the
next thing I got from there is a little
bit more appropriate for this season and
it's this jumper with daisies of it so
it's sort of like a recurring theme with
flowers but I really like the design so
I got it and it's just this really cute
black knit jumper it's really thick and
again it's cropped so that's perfect
because I'm always wearing high-waisted
things so this will just be great for
autumn and winter and the quality is
really amazing like it's really soft and
really thick and the last thing that I
picked up from NYC tea is their pair of
sunglasses again I know it's not the
season but I couldn't pass this up
because they are so cute so I will
definitely just keep them stored for
next summer and look at them they think
we want to weep isn't that cute they're
so cute they're like little cat
they're like cat I sort of lens things
with these cute like cat ears on the
sides and I just love them I love any
sunglasses that are cat eye shaped and
these are just perfect the next place
that I shopped at words are yawns they
were kind enough to send me two things
to try out and the first thing I
snatched up was this pair of loafers and
I posted these on Instagram and they're
just amazing they've got this really
gorgeous flower design on them really
artsy really me so I had to get them a
thing they are really well made and I
think that they will just be lovely for
spring and summer and maybe even the
less sweater days of autumn so I love
these and they are so comfortable like
so comfortable and the next thing that
they said to me was this sort of like
reds burgundy cape thing I'm not too
sure how to show this to you but it's
this really cool like autumn ask autumn
s that's not word autumnal sort of piece
and I really really like here is
something that I usually wouldn't wear
but I wanted to try it out and it's just
amazing it's like basically a cape it is
a cave so it's like a cape poncho I'm
really excited to try and style this
somehow I think the quality of this is
really good as well it's really quite
heavy and as you guys know heavy usually
equals good quality so yeah so love it
the next place is Oasis at OSF is a
lovely website for clothes as well and I
really like it
so I picked up with this dress this is a
really really old dress I've had for
ages but I never made a video about it
because I forgot so this is it and it's
like this really lovely grid pattern
it's got a nice sort of like bow thing
in the front and it cinches in at the
waist so really underlined like a
feminine sort of waist and it goes just
above the knee so quite a good length
and again I think the quality is really
good I think it's gonna be great to sort
of layer up and yeah it's just a really
lovely
and this print is Rudy in at the moment
the next thing from OS app is a jumper
so a little bit more appropriate for the
season and it's this wave paintings by a
Japanese artist I can never pronounce
their name so I'm not even gonna try but
I'm pretty sure you guys have seen this
painting everywhere it's a really famous
painting so yeah I really love the
Japanese sort of writing on this side on
the sleeve and it's it's the same print
on both sides which is pretty awesome
and I just love anything to do with like
art on clothes like anything arty on
clothes I'm in and the last thing I got
from Oasis app is this Navy shirts it's
not buttoned up at the moment and it's
got like tiny little daisies all over
the front which is really cool because
they're like embroidered into the fabric
and I love shirts and I love daisies and
I just love flowers as you guys probably
know by now and this is just perfect
it's quite long as well so it could be
sort of like warm with leggings and it
would look pretty cute and the last
thing I had shocked on was she inside
and here I've got two coats for the
wintertime and the first one is this
sort of like noise and gray and white no
it's not really great it's like it's
sort of like a gray slash navy color it
comes up gray on the camera it's got
like tiny little speckles of gold here
and there which is pretty awesome and
it's quite the long as well so perfect
for winter because it keeps you warm the
quality is actually really good I was
quite surprised with this because I
thought she inside wouldn't have that
great quality coats but these are
actually really thick and really warm so
I really recommend to go check out chi
inside if you want to get a coat for
winter because they are really
reasonably
reasonably they are really reasonably
priced I can't speak English and the
quality is really good as well so and
the other coat is this one it's like
this tan beige emojis tan brown color
and I really like his well it's the same
sort of cut and design as the other one
but of course this one is a different
texture and you know color and stuff so
yeah I want to experiment with coats and
colors this winter so this one is really
cool and that is all for my call I hope
you guys enjoyed this if you want to get
any of the stuff that I showed you in
this video then all the links will be
