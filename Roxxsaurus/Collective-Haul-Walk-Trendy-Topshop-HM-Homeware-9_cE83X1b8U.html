collective haul I haven't actually done
one of these in maybe a few weeks and I
thought I would just show you like a
collection of things that I have bought
for a few weeks time and just a
disclaimer I haven't actually been
shopping that much because I'm trying to
save up for my car and yeah so there's
not gonna be loads and loads of stuff
but there's just a few bits that I
wanted to show you guys so I hope you
guys enjoy it and let's just jump right
in so the first category that I'm gonna
start with are like cloves and we all
have clothes so yeah this is probably my
favourite section of this haul just and
the first thing is this really really
cool cropped shirt from walk trendy in
the clintus i posted this on Instagram
and so many of you have been wondering
where I got it from so yeah walk trendy
I will have the link down below I just
love it so much I just think it looks
really cool ped was like like
high-waisted jeans and the next shirt is
also a crop top it's basically like the
same style of shirt as the last one but
this one has unstyled on it I just
thought it was really funny five packs
of the day actually I am born on the
same day as Einstein so basically genius
and the last thing from walk trendy is
this a really cool body con style dress
I believe it's got like moons and stars
you can probably tell that I'm very into
moons and stars from the first crop top
as well it had pretty much the same
pattern as this and I don't really know
why I wear this cuz I don't usually wear
dresses but I just couldn't pass this up
because it's such a gorgeous dress and
also I thought if I never actually wear
this as a dress I could just cut it down
into like a crop top or something and
just wear it like that the next thing I
have is a simple black blazer and this
is from H&amp;amp;M and I really love this
blazer because it has got just one
button and it's very like sneak and the
sleeves are cuffed so that's
right they go up to like maybe this sort
of length and I just love it like a
black blazer is a staple piece of my
wardrobe so I have so many of these and
the next thing is a top this is from new
look and this is like the old school new
look look at the label like it's like
one of the really old labels I actually
got this from a thrift store and I
literature can pass this up because of
how gorgeous the pattern is on it it's
just like an illustration of like really
traditionally painted people I don't
really know what to describe it as but I
just really love the print and I love
the colors they're very like muted and
just like grayscale sort of thing and I
love colors are very muted that's
probably the only colors that I were
saying that on a day when we're in loads
of color but you guys know that I am
literally what about black the next
thing is a little black skirt like this
this is from boohoo and I got this from
a charity shop as well I really really
like it it's got like a nice texture to
it I don't know if it picks up on camera
but it's really nice and you can work
high-waisted it's long enough for that
so I think you'll be quite useful for
spring and summer and another item it's
also from new like and it's this really
cool dog tooth or dog pound tooth dress
it's very straight and it doesn't have
much shape to it but it's got these cute
little pockets at the end which I found
really adorable you don't really see
many dresses with pockets next thing I
got is this pair of high-waisted jeans
and they're like acid-wash and skinny so
I got these from Primark I'm not sure
how much they were but they were
probably like 12 pounds or something I
hoped and get trapped in the cycle of
wearing black jeans so this is a nice
switch up for that last one the topic of
jeans I also got a pair of the mom jeans
from Topshop and I used to have these
but I solved them because I I don't know
I just thought that they're not me and
I didn't really like the shape and how
they looked on me but when I tried these
on I thought they're a bit better and
maybe I'll learn to like star them
properly and you know wear them properly
so I got another pair I gave them a
second try and I actually really liked
them I think they're a nice switch up to
my usual black skinny jeans like I said
and I don't know they're just like
really roomy but also look really cool
and like a made back and like you're not
trying a lot now moving on to the makeup
portion of this haul I'm going to show
you guys the two best lip sticks of all
time and basically they are two
lipsticks by Clarence Paris there are
very very nude colors and they are
actually instant light lip balm
perfectors and now they're not really
really pigmented but I actually like
that because they're very moisturizing
and they do give your lips a subtle pop
of color and I really like that actually
I think it looks very effortless for
spring and summer and then I also got
the Clarins lip pencil and this is in
praline or praline I'm not too sure how
to pronounce it but this is the most
gorgeous lip liner it makes your lips
look so much larger and you know some
lip liners when you use them to overdraw
your lips lightly they look very obvious
and this one doesn't because I find that
this one is very close to my actual lip
color and I find that a combo of this
and this isn't it you like an another
lip product is the fuchsia flash bye-bye
Maybelline New York looks like this it's
a very very out-there color they're pink
very fuchsia but this is really really
nice for spring and summer and I also
got a nail polish by Bourjois and this
is in shade what shade is this in
tangerine they talk 3-3 I really like
this ahhh I'm so excited to try this out
on my nails I'm very like my nails look
or what the moment but I'm very nude
my nails all the time so they get very
boring so I just wanted a flash of color
for my hands because there deserve it
and the last of my Beauty / makeup leave
bits are three perfumes actually
recently I well all of my life I'm
basically obsessed with perfumes so the
first one is Lacoste
pour femme it's called this smells oh
I'm always dropping it this smells
really like fresh I don't really I'm not
very good at describing perfume sets as
you guys probably know already so I'm
not gonna attempt it and then I also got
the Lolita Lempicka and it looks like
this I used to have this perfume and
recently my mom Barry purchased it for
me so the last perfume I got in by Fendi
and this is called Lacroix Rosa I got
good at French this scent personal is
really like it does have notes of
sweetness but it's like a really much
cool womans or smell so if you're not
already into that then this you wouldn't
like this very much but luckily I love
the smell so I got that and last thing I
wanted to show you guys a few homeware
bits that I picked up recently the first
two are like my favorite and they are
basically two little pugs and wearing
sunglasses let's just take a moment to
appreciate that how adorable are they
these are from the range I don't know
everywhere in the world will have the
range but it's just like a home where
slash craft store so I got these and
they sit in the living room next up is
the Yankee like burner thing you know
I've already got one of the candles in
there I'm not sure which one this is but
it smells very like strawberry as you
can probably imagine from the color and
then I've also got a sweet pea and the
other one is Peach Smoothie so I thought
that these will be like really fresh and
really nice for spring the next thing is
this little like hot chocolate mug I
thought it was so cute this is from Ikea
I got two but I'm gonna
one because I couldn't move on till I
bring the other one so yeah this is
really really cute it's it's in the
kitchen
I don't know it's just cute
what ass can I say about it the next
thing is a cool vintage telephone and I
picked this up from a like old antique
store I'm pretty sure this is from like
1980s or something like that
and it looks really really authentic and
I like it so much I'm gonna put it on my
side table then I also picked up this
retro inspired clock and I think this is
from Sainsbury's or something like this
home section in Sainsbury's yeah I just
really like it my whole living room is
inspired by like pop art and the bat
robes or themed so this goes great in
here and yeah if you guys would like to
see what my living room looks like I
filmed a room and living room tour like
ages ago and it's a really bad video and
it's very long but if you guys want to
get like the gist of what it looks like
that and go over there and watch it and
the last home where item that I got
recently is it's a really cool picture
frame and inside its got like a picture
of a Victorian lady you with a baby and
I could easily take that out but I think
I like it so I'm gonna keep it in and
then look straight on my wall
I've got this from a very small store in
High Wycombe and there's no point in me
telling you what store it's from because
there are very small business so they're
shutting down and yeah I got that before
they shut down basically
I love it so much so recently I was in
London Camden and obviously I had to go
to like stables and all these different
markets so when I went I noticed there
was a guy selling loads of Records so I
was like oh my god record so I was like
first in line to go to that stall and I
managed to find the David Bowie single
heroes and this is like my favorite song
by David Bowie so I had to have it and
it was in the South section that so this
only cost me like three pounds and it's
the tunnel song as you guys might know
impacts of being a wolf I was obviously
my favorite movie so I got this and I
was very very pleased and that was all
for my collector pool I hope you guys

suggestions for videos you like to see
them please comment down below I am so
close to running out of ideas for videos
