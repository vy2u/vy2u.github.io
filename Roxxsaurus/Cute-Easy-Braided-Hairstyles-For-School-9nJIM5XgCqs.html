channel I hope you guys at all well can
you guys tell the difference when there
is finally more silver I'm so happy with
it I know I'm going to get lots of
questions about where I got it done so I
will list all the information down in
the description I could have done a
lovely salad
called Billy Curie in London and the guy
that in my house called Tom so oh this
one of these information down below as
well anyways today I'm going to be
filming another hair video today I'm
going to be filming a three different
like kind of half updates half down DS I
think they're so gorgeous and they are
inspired by Game of Thrones again I
haven't seen the show still but I'm
going to watch over summer I have
decided that I'm going to watch in with
rose during the summer when I have more
time you guys actually have to remind me
because I want to watch it so bad I just
don't have time to watch it at all these
days also before we jump straight in I
want to mention that I have started
using this really cool app it's
basically a little bit like snapchat but
you guys can ask me questions through a
video and I will answer through a video
and I'm going to be doing like a session
every week I think because I really want
to talk to you guys by the way this
isn't an ad I just want to share with
you guys that I'm going to be doing this
hat more so yeah make sure you follow me
I'll leave the link and down below you
can just download it via your App Store
and then follow me on there and then
leave me a bunch of questions but when I
do have a session of just answering your
questions next time they'll just be
really fun and intimate so I hope to see
you guys on there and talk to you
personally if you guys enjoy this video
be sure to give it a thumbs up as always
and subscribe to this channel as well as
my blog Channel and without probably
that she should pay to the video the
very first head start is super simple
what you want to do is take two sections
and from the very front of your face at
the top just like this and let's take
this to the back and basically tie this
together with a clear elastic next you
want to take the ponytail that you've
just created and kind of loop it through
itself to create a kind of waterfall
twist effect once that's done you want
to take another two sections from the
side of your face just above the ear and
then basically repeat the same step so
you want to take it to the back secure
it with the clear elastic and then loop
it through itself once or twice so this
is the final pair so it's super simple
like I said but I think it's so cute
especially for school if you're gonna
get your hair out of your face it's
super super simple but it does look like
you put a lot of effort into it the next
hairstyle is your typical khaleesi hair
so much choice
all the time this hairstyle is basically
a very similar to the one that we just
did so exactly as the last house I'll
take in the top section of my hair and
I'm going to start braiding this and now
you can repeat the same thing to the
other side so now that you've created
these two braids you want to start
tugging on them but just add a little
bit more volume to them because they are
quite thin at the moment the next step
you want to do is take your two braids
to the bag and tie them together so now
like in the previous hairstyle you want
to take two chunks of hair just above
your ear and basically repeat the same
thing to those once your braids are
nicely secured again once you just tug
on them a little bit to add extra body
and now you just want to take these
braids to the back once again and tie
them together so this is what the hair
cell looks like again it's not
complicated it's pretty simple to do
which is the best thing about it and it
looks really gorgeous it's just so
pretty I think it's one of my favorite
khaleesi hairstyles the next hairstyle
is tiny bit more difficult there's more
steps to it would you kind of have to
get the hang on but once you break it
down into sections and becomes a really
easy hairstyle so the first step is to
section off a chunk of hair out the
crown of your head also towards the back
and then you want to twist this into a
big fun
once your Burnitz spawns you want to
take two sections of your hair from the
top and basically start braiding this so
now you've got your two braids you
wouldn't be cyclists Tartt taking these
to the bag and wrapping it around the
bun next you want to take another strand
of hair from each side of your face just
above the ear and start braiding this as
well so now these two sections wanna
basically repeat the same thing and
start running these around the bun on
the back now the very last step of this
hairstyle is to take a chunk of hair
just behind your ear and start braiding
this as well make sure to leave a strand
of hair just by your ear just to frame
the face a little bit better
and the last step is to of course wrap
these around the bun as well and this is
the final hairstyle again I think it's
just so beautiful this one is a little
bit harder and it does take a little bit
more time than the first two but I think
it's super worth it those are my three
hairstyles I hope you guys enjoyed this
