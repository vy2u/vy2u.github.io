you guys are all well yay
as you can tell from the title I'm going
to be doing a hack testing video and I
have no idea how this is gonna turn out
honestly I'm a little bit scared
basically what I'm going to be creating
this video is a charcoal peel-off mask
for your nose like a nose strip thing
you know if you get those from the store
but I'm going to be doing one at home
all DIY doing it all myself so hopefully
fingers crossed this will go well this
video is inspired by Nichols skies and
to some other people I can't actually
remember but I've seen a lot of these
videos on YouTube and it seems to work
for everyone so I thought why not try it
because if it works for everyone
obviously the work for me so the two
ingredients you're going to need for
this video are some PVA glue or Elmer's
glue whatever I know in a lot of these
videos the people use Elmer's glue but
because we don't have one in the UK I'm
just going to be using this one from the
range so this glue is a Children's Zoo
so it's non-toxic so I'm pretty sure you
can use this on your face and if it's
not added that's half of my face off
then I can just say I did it for the
Internet and then the second ingredient
you're going to need are some charcoal
pills I've got this problem boots and
these are like indigestion pills I'm
gonna be around the bush
you take these if you need to get rid of
like gasps they're called a wind away
activated charcoal to help reduce
buildup of intestinal gas lovely so if
you buy this you can use it for two
purposes now you can use it for face as
well as for your you know your other end
so what you do next is quite difficult
so you guys really should like listen up
because it's very very complicated so
the first thing you do is you put your
glue into a bowl or plate I know this
could be a bit tricky so don't mess it
up and then you take your capsules your
charcoal stuff and you open this up and
just pour a few onto the glue and then
you mix all that up you know the drill
and that is all
that is what you do so difficult
so yeah you mix that up nice and I don't
know what go with that and then you want
to take some hot flannel like dip it in
real hot water I like just laying there
don't burn yourself you know and then
you pop that on your nose so that your
pores can like open up and all that
stuff but next what you're going to do
is take this gloopy consistency and just
pop out with your nose as we do I'm a
little bit scared of this to be honest
it doesn't look like the type of thing
you'd ever want to put on your face like
ever okay so as you can see my nose is a
little bit right because I just steamed
it and now it's time to pop over the
mask of doom
okay this is very watery so do be
careful with it when you apply it to
your face I have feeling that this will
probably drip off of my face a little
bit Oh God
so if you try this at home don't wear
any fancy clothes because they will be
ruined I just got it on my top oh my god
it's like dripping into my nostril no I
don't understand why it's going like
this can you see like it's going really
like bitty it's not like one opaque
colors it like separates maybe it's the
glue I've used I don't really know so
far so bad GC well I mean it's like gone
really weird I'm adding a little bit of
a different glue to see if it changes
anything okay so now that I'm using this
other glue it's looking a little bit
better okay so this is what it looks
like on my face it feels so weird
it feels really cold and gloopy and just
I got my mirror dirty because it dripped
onto it so I feel like this process is
quite a messy one and sparkly I don't
know if I can be bothered like to do
this I wouldn't really quit a hack I
think I've put on a little bit too much
like the layer is really thick but I
feel like if I put it quite thin it
won't actually peel
my face it's already dripped on my top
so I don't want it to drip anywhere you
see that it's like dripping off of the
tip of my nose I don't know what to do
about it like how long is it gonna take
to drive dry okay so I think I'm going
to go for a little while to see if this
is going to dry so maybe like 10 years
or so you can expect me back and then I
can let you know how it works
I think I might be here a while so at
the moment I feel like it's quite a lot
of effort for something that's called a
hack like isn't a hack supposed to be
something that's gonna make your life
easier this is not this does not make my
life easy at all I could like punch
someone right now this is all going so
wrong okay so a quick little update this
isn't dry yet and I want to sit over on
my bed and it dripped on my bed sheets
it dripped on my top and dripped on my
bed cheese and I don't think I've ever
been this mad filming a YouTube video
like I'm so annoyed so yeah I think
that's pretty much like the summary of
this video you know like just don't ever
do this at home like you just don't my
nose is so itchy or I know I like our
nature
okay so I'm back I've had this on my
nose for about 20 minutes and I feel
like the tip of my nose is still a
little bit wet but I don't think it's
going to dry for like another 10 years
so honestly I'm just going to pull it
off and see what has happened okay okay
so that is quite painful
oh this is so painful if you have
sensitive skin I definitely would not do
this asshole okay so I pulled off the
blister kid and this last bit is not
bright at all so I'm gonna just wipe it
off okay so having a look at this I can
definitely see some gunk that it's put
up my pores
I think most of it is actually like
little hairs that I might powder my nose
I am a little bit impressed like keys to
the real go through so much pain and
yawns to get to this so most of the
people that have did this video use
Elmer's glue and it's an American glue
which we don't have you in the UK so I
used to like different types of loose so
maybe that's why it didn't work as well
but it's nothing like extraordinary I
wouldn't really recommend for you guys
to do this at all because it's more
hassle than it's worth
so yeah that is all for this video I
hope you guys found this video
entertaining by watching me go through
this pain if you did then definitely
