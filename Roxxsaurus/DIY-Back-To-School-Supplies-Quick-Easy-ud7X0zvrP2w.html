channel I hope you guys are all well
today is an exciting day because I'm
starting so I know you guys are probably
thinking Roxie you are starting way too
soon how dare you talk about back to
school my summer has just started that's
the last thing I want to think about but
on this channel back to school is all
about making it fun even though school
sucks a little bit I know but I hope you
guys don't mind me getting a little bit
of an early start also before we talk
straight into this video I want to let
you guys know I am hosting a huge
back-to-school giveaway in about two
days time so everything you're going to
see in this video like all the props
they're actually going to be part of the
giveaway and there's going to be three
winners all you have to do is be
subscribe to my channel to enter and
yeah I just want to let you guys know
that because it's coming very soon and
I'm just super super excited because I
know you guys are gonna love what I
picked out for you so yeah I say cheat
for that and make sure you're subscribed
and keep your eyes peeled but without
further ado let's just generate a video
so we're going to start off with one of
the easiest DIYs of this video what you
want for this is some regular pencils
and some colorful washi tape so what
we're going to do is take the washi tape
measure it to the length of our pencil
and cut it and stick it around the
circumference of our pencil you want to
do this on both sides so that your
pencil is evenly covered all around I
love this DIY so much because it's such
a quick and easy way to spice up your
regular boring pencils and you can make
a number of different designs
I just really personalized your pencils
or pens for this next one we're going to
be spicing up on notebooks now I know
these notebooks aren't very boring
because they are glittery but we're
going to make them even better so I'm
heading off to my Photoshop you can use
PicMonkey or any online website for this
if you don't have Photoshop and I'm just
basically creating a collage of my kind
of design I went for two of my favorite
shows at the moment which is prettier
two lies and scream queens I love these
shows so so much so once I printed off
my pages and cutting your knees out and
laying them across my notebook just to
make sure my design is right and then
I'm going to use some PVA glue and stick
my design on
notebook once that's done it should look
something like this now to seal the two
notebooks you want to use some Mod Podge
or clear sealant and this actually dries
clear so you're not going to see any
white residue at all but it just makes
sure that none of the edges will unstick
when you are using these notebooks and
these are the finished notebook I know
you just love these DIYs so much because
it's such a great conversation starter
especially on the first day of school
and if anyone else notices your
notebooks and love the shows as well you
are instantly going to click and make
friends now for the next DIY we're going
to be creating a really easy pencil case
made out of felt so what you're gonna do
is take a piece of felt measure out how
long your pencils are and then it cut
away the excess material I'm now folding
the material just a little bit over 1/3
of the way and I'm folding the little
flap across to kind of go halfway across
the pencil case I'm not really good at
explaining but I hope you know what I
mean enough to put the pencil case
together you are going to need some
thread and a sewing needle if you don't
know how to sew or you're too young
please get a parent to help you out with
theirs alternatively you can also use
some hot glue but I think it looks much
cuter when it's so together and don't
worry I'm not a pro at sewing either so
this is a learning curve for both of us
to finish off the loop I'm puttin the
needle inside the pencil case and
basically tying it off so that the
thread doesn't come undone I'm now
figuring out where my two buttons are
going to go and I'm just sewing them on
and then I'm cutting a little slit for
the buttons so that we can actually
fasten our pencil case and this is the
finished pencil case I love how it
turned out it looks so so cute and it's
super easy to make for the next DIY
you're going to need some of those like
color hanging chart things that you can
get from home base or just any store
that sells paint you want to cut them up
and align them color-coordinated stick
them to an 84 piece of paper and write
some numbers on it and this is your
homemade calendar I love this so much
because you can literally stick it into
your notebook and you can plan out your
school month or week or whatnot and if
you have any homework you can write this
down and it's just really cute and
colorful the last DIY is again spicing
up a boring notebook you want to take
some tape and align it into like a weird
abstract design and then you want to
take some tracing paper and trace along
the little triangles or shapes that you
have made and use this as a guideline
for cutting out your designs into like
cool patterned paper or whatnot you can
take some magazine cutouts for this
whatever you wish and basically stick
them in between the shapes that you have
made and now to seal everything in place
you want to take some clear tape and
simply just tape it across your front
cover and that all you have to do it's
super super simple really cute and I
love it as a little idea my back to
school stationery I really hope you guys
