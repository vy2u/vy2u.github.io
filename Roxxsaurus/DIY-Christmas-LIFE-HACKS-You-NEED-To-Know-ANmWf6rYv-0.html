shiny nose this is so uncomfortable but
look how cool this is it's a freakin
flashing mouth and we've got my antlers
at the ready as well plant in my antlers
I have to sit like all the way back here
for you to see my antlers I'm just gonna
take them off by antlers very wide and
welcome back to my channel I hope you
guys are doing super well said today I'm
gonna be doing a Christmas related video
because I am getting in the festive mood
and I'm so so excited for this I'm gonna
be doing Christmas hacks I've never done
the Christmas hack video before so this
is super exciting for me as I love
Christmas so so much if you guys enjoyed
this video please smash that huge thumbs
up just down below let's try and get
this video to 40,000 likes can we do it
I think you guys can do it I also have a
blog channel make sure you guys are
subscribed I'll leave it in the little I
see you guys can click that and head
over there
I'm actually gonna be doing vlogmas this
year so make sure you guys are sub just
so you don't miss a video from me I'm
gonna be posting every single day for
other month of December also let me know
down in the comments below which one of
these hats was your favorite Bowl
already unless your way to the video
hack number one is perfect for wrapping
gifts when you using sir tape if you are
one of those people who always loses
their end try placing a paperclip over
your sellotape and then put in your end
over the top this way when you're using
your thirds hip you won't keep losing
your end
hi number two is making a really cute
DIY stand for the table at Christmas so
what you need is three candy canes on to
break them off to make them a little bit
shorter and then you want to sellotape
them together into a triangular kind of
shape and then what you can do is just
pop this on the table and have like a
name tag on there or the name of dishes
I think this is really really cute for
the dinner table
TAC number three is a great one to stop
your wrapping paper from unraveling
itself all you need is they used up
toilet rolls it all you have to do is
just cut a little slit throughout the
cardboard and then just use this as a
cover for the wrapping paper so this is
gonna keep it in place and make sure it
doesn't unravel the next hack is making
your own DIY ball ball so what you need
is a clear glass ball ball some crayons
and a hairdryer so what I'm doing is I'm
taking a red and a white crayon I'm
breaking this off into tiny chunks and
placing them in the ball ball and then
I'm gonna take my hairdryer
and just melt this inside as I twist the
bull balls and this is going to create
some interesting shapes and patterns
with the crayons if you're gonna do this
make sure you've super careful because
the ball ball does get very hot so just
make sure you don't burn yourself
I think these bull balls are so so cute
I think this would also make perfect
gifts because they're so customizable
and you can make whatever colors you
like
hack number five is making some DIY
Christmas ornaments so what you need is
some pinecones and some green acrylic
paint all I'm doing is I'm just coating
all of the pine cone with green paint
make sure the insides is evenly covered
as well I'm then taking some adhesive
gems and just sticking these on onto the
petals of the pinecone and this is gonna
make it look like baubles and then also
adding some gold leaf detailing and then
just popping my star on top and this is
the finished DIY I think this looks
super cute you could also make these
into bubbles it's super fun and really
easy to do the next hack is making your
own DIY wreath out of a Christmas play
all you need to do is cut a hole inside
a paper plate and then you can just use
some leftover wrapping paper that you
may have laying around you then want to
cut the wrapping paper into a short slit
and fold them over and start gluing this
around the circumference of the paper
plate you want to do this in three
separate layers and you'll have a really
cool design by the end of it to finish
off the reef you can also add a
centerpiece with a really cute bauble
such as this one and that is the reef
complete it's super easy and really
cheap to do
the next hacker is transforming your
regular napkin into a Christmas tree
napkin so what you want to do is take a
corner and start folding this on each
other as I'm doing here
you want to do this until you get to the
very very bottom and then you want to
flip this over and fold in the corners
of the napkin like I'm doing here you
want to almost create a triangle at the
top after that you want to flip it back
over onto the other side turn it around
and start folding the flaps all the way
up and tucking them in underneath the
top one and that is how you create a
really cute Christmas napkin design hack
number eight is making a Christmas tree
less sparse looking so to make it full
out all you need is a green tinsel you
want to just wrap this around into the
middle and if your Christmas tree is a
little bit sparse like mine this will
make it look much fuller heck nominee is
making your own DIY advent calendar so
what you need is a muffin tray for this
some paper and something round
so I'm using a seller tape to draw out
12 circles onto my cardboard and then
also taking a slightly smaller circle
and I'm drawing this on leftover
wrapping paper I'm then sticking the
wrapping paper onto the white cardboard
and I'm cutting all of my circles out to
finish it off you want to add some
cutout numbers out of your leftover
cardboard and use some sellotape to
attach all of your circles to the muffin
tray
and the last hack is for storing away
your Christmas lights all you need is a
finished wrapping paper tube and all you
have to do is just wrap your lights
around this it's such a simple hack but
it saves you so much time for next year
when you are unpacking at your lights to
put up on your Christmas tree so that is
all for my Christmas hats I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video and found it
helpful because there's so many things
around Christmas that are super
stressful so these hacks will just make
it so much less principled and much more
enjoyable if you're gonna do this really
make sure you smash that huge thumbs up

this video to 40,000 lights I know we
