today I have a four DIY Halloween
costumes for last minute for you guys
these costumes are inspired by Disney as
you can probably tell by my headband and
I absolutely love Disney so these
questions are going to be a little bit
more cute than scary I hope this video
helps you guys find a costume for
Halloween so it can be a little bit
pricy and stressful then these are just
a few questions that you can DIY at home
for super cheap make sure you guys like
this video if you enjoy it and also
subscribe if you are brand new come and
join the dinosaur family bold everybody
let's get on into the video okay so the
first costume we're going to be creating
is this monster Inc a costume now for
this all you're gonna need is a Greenert
top or dress and some felt fabric in
color black blue and also white so the
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
lay out to my green shirt and also start
cutting out a round eyeball kind of
shape I'm then gonna place that on top
of my shirt and start gluing that onto
the actual shirt with some hot glue
after that you want to take the blue
felt fabric and I'm gonna cut out a
slightly smaller circle into the blue
and this is going to be creating the
iris of the eyeball and lastly to finish
off the eye I'm gonna be creating the
actual pupil so I'm cutting out a
smaller round circle and just gluing
that on to the rest of the eye to finish
off the eyeball I'm also gonna take a
very thin piece of fabric and just glue
that to the very top of the eyeball to
create a lashline effect the next thing
I'm doing is I'm taking some black felt
fabric and I'm just creating the mouth
shape now for the teeth of the mouth I'm
taking some white felt fabric and I'm
just cutting out little tabs that have
rounded shapes at the ends for the
bottom I'm just doing the same thing so
I'm just cutting out the teeth and once
I've got all of the shapes cut out and
ready to be stuck on I'm gonna take my
hot glue gun and just apply a bit of
glue under a tooth and just stick them
onto the black fabric I'm gonna create a
little monster ink headband with some
horns so for this I'm taking a brown
headband and some styrofoam cones that I
got from Hobby craft and this sheet all
I'm doing is I'm just adding a dot of
hot glue onto the cone and just sticking
that onto the headband that matches my
hair color and this is the finished
monster in costume you can pair this
with some green stockings and I feel
like this costume is so cute but it was
so easy to do
now the next costume is a Cheshire cat
costume this is probably my favorite
costumes of the four so basically what
you need for this is a purple shirt so
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take my masking tape and I'm just
gonna stick that on the shirt in stripes
leaving the same distance between each
part of the day and I'm also just gonna
cover up the sleeves with the remainder
of the black felt fabric from the last
DIY so what you want to do is take some
fabric spray this one I got from Hobby
craft and I actually realized that it
wasn't really as pigmented as what I was
looking for so I actually ended up going
over this with some plain pink acrylic
paint and I feel like the result was so
much better and so much more opaque than
the actual fabric paint once this dry
you're gonna peel off the tape and
you're gonna reveal this really cool
stripes obviously it's not gonna be
perfect but I think it looks pretty cool
and then just gonna cut off the sleeves
to make the shirt a little bit more
tailored now a folder is I'm gonna take
this purple headband and also some a
purple cardboard which I'm gonna start
cutting out the template of my cat is
onto and then it'll take some purple
felt fabric and I'm gonna use it the
actual cardboard ear as a template for
the felt you want the felt to be exactly
the same size as the actual cardboard
stencil because we're gonna be sticking
on the felt onto the fabric seeing as
the felt fabric is quite floppy it's not
really gonna hold its shape so we're
gonna really take advantage of the
stiffness of the cardboard and that's
gonna give it that firm cat is shape and
then I'm gonna take some of this pink
pipe wire that I also got from Hobby
craft and I'm just gonna cut little
strips of this and just kind of place
that over the ears and stripes again
once I've got my desired length I'm just
gonna start sticking them on to the
actual felt fabric so that they stay
nice and secure I'm then taking both of
those ears and I'm going to you a cut
out a little shape at the bottom just so
that they fit a little bit nicer and
snug over the actual headband and once I
have the desired shape of those I'm just
gonna use some hot glue and just stick
the ears onto the headband now to really
complete the ears I'm gonna take some of
this fluffy fabric that I also got from
Hobby graft and I'm just gonna stick
that onto the headband for some extra
fluffy sass and now for the tutu of this
outfit I'm just gonna take these really
thick ribbons that I got in purple and
pink so to make the tutu what you need
to do is take a little bit of the ribbon
and kind of measure out your waist and
tie this in a round circle like so this
is going to be the base bar
of your tutu and you're going to be
adding all of the fluffy parts of the
tutu onto that so I'm gonna take some
short strips of the ribbon and just tie
it around in a knot like so and just let
the ends kind of flow down and create
the tutu effect you want to let the
layers kind of build up so that the
ribbon becomes more and more opaque so
that it looks like a real tutu I'm
actually gonna alternate between the
pink and the purple ribbons just to
really continue that theme of the
striped cat after a little while once
you really build up all the ribbon it
starts really taking shape and it looks
super fluffy and really cute and this is
the finished costume
I feel like this looks like it could be
store-bought it is so easy to make but
it's really effective and I feel like
it's a pretty unique costume that a lot
of people won't think to dress up as for
this Halloween
now the next costume is the Maleficent
costume and I absolutely love this one
ever since I watched the movie I was
like in love with this character so to
make the headband all I'm doing is I'm
just taking a brown headband like this
and then I'm taking some tin foil like
your regular kitchen tin foil and I'm
going to kind of wrap this around at the
headband creating the two horns so as
you can see I'm just really pressing
down and condensing that tin foil into
the shape that I want it to be I'm just
kind of bending it inwards and then out
words as you can see feel free to add
more tin foil at the base of the horn if
you feel like it's a little bit too thin
and then I'm obviously gonna repeat the
same thing to the other side this is
literally the easiest task ever anyone
can make this once you have your desired
shape of the horns you want to take some
hot glue and just hot glue that in place
to the headband I'm then gonna take the
black masking tape from the first DIY
and I'm just literally going to take a
few strips of that just to cover up the
tin foil and this is the finished
headband now next up we're gonna make
Maleficent famous star so for this we're
gonna be taking at this little Christmas
globe that I literally got for probably
like a pound and we're gonna be pouring
at some a darker green and lighter green
acrylic paint into it and just kind of
mixing it around the inside to create
this really cool swirly pattern I'm then
taking an old broomstick and I'm just
gonna glue that globe on to the end of
the broomstick and using the black tape
I'm gonna connect the two so that you
don't see the gap between the broom and
the actual globes
to really make the staff even more
detailed and realistic I'm gonna be
cutting out these little thin strips and
just sticking that over the actual globe
and then gonna take the rest of that
tape and I'm just gonna tape that over
the broomstick to make it all black and
really match with the rest of the look
and that is it for the staff it was
super easy to make now the next part of
the DIY is to create Melissa since
famous caller so for this I'm gonna cut
an a4 piece of a felt fabric in half
like so to create two triangles and then
I'm just gonna take some tinfoil and
kind of fold it into a triangle as well
and sandwich that between the two
fabrics putting the tinfoil inside is
going to make it a little bit more
malleable and able to kind of like
create some shape into it rather than
just having a floppy piece of felt
fabric so you actually want to make two
of these and then you can just hot glue
those onto your long black robe and the
last costume is a Bambi costume I
absolutely love the Disney movie Bambi
so for this costume what you're gonna
need is a turtleneck and also some
leggings both in brown color you're then
gonna need some white felt fabric that
you're just gonna cut a bunch of circles
into you can just kind of alternate
between shapes between sizes just really
make it your own
because we're gonna be creating the
little spots that reindeers have on
their back so once you have cut out all
your circles you just want to go ahead
and glue those all on to the back and
that is it for the actual top now moving
on to the tail I'm gonna be using this
felt fabric in this creamy kind of color
and in this I'm just gonna cut out the
shape of the tail and then kind of do
the same but a little bit smaller and
just kind of glue that smaller shape
onto the cream fabric I'm then gonna
take my leggings and just glue the very
top of the tail and kind of like fold it
over and then stick that onto the back
of my leggings so the actual reindeer is
I'm gonna be taking at some Brown felt
fabric and I'm creating the ear shape as
you can see so I'm just folded over the
fabric twice so you get the same kind of
stencil once I've cut my stencils out
I'm gonna trim each of the sides to make
the lighter brown fabric a little bit
smaller than the darker Brown so that
when we hot glue the lights are Brown
onto the darker brown you can still see
the edging of the dark brown fabric I'm
then gonna take some hot glue and just
pop a tiny dot at the very bottom of
each of the ear and just kind of fold it
together
a sense of freedom mention and Megg the
ears look a little less flat once that's
done I'm gonna take both of the ears and
just stick them on to my trusty brown
headband and those are the finished
reindeer ears and this is the finished
Bambi costume I think this is so cute I
love how this turned out and it was so
easy to make it was so super inexpensive
so anyone could create this so those are
all of my DIY Halloween costumes and I
