hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys all well today
I'm going to be showing you how to
create these iOS DIY contour and
highlight balms I have seen a few people
do these iOS DIY videos and I thought
this so cool and they're really fun to
create and watch and I thought I would
also try and recreate this for you guys
and see if it actually works if you guys
enjoyed this video please be sure to
give a thumbs up and subscribe to this
channel as well as my blog channel if
you're new but I've ever do let's jump
right into the video so for this DIY
you're of course going to need some iOS
bombs you're also going to need some
coconut oil a few chap sticks some
cornflour also known as cornstarch and
then of course your highlighter of
choice as well as your contour product
so the first thing you want to do is
take your chapstick and just take them
out of their packaging and place them
into two parts I actually only have
three chapstick so I just put one and a
half into each pot next you want to take
your coconut oil and add a spoon and a
half of this into each of the pots once
that's done you can go in with your
cornflour and just add a teaspoon of
this into the mixture and the cornflour
is going to mattify the whole thing and
make the coconut oil less greasy once
you have done that you want to take your
contour and highlight products and start
deporting this into the mixture I
actually used a brow powder from Rimmel
for my contour product because it's
quite cool toned and it hasn't got any
shimmer in so I thought this would be a
great pigment for my contour product and
then for my highlight I used a 17
shimmer brick this is quite an
affordable highlighter so I didn't mind
ruining it once that is done you can go
ahead and mix all of your ingredients
together and then pop both of these pots
into the microwave for about 40 seconds
and meanwhile that is happening you can
deport your US bomb by popping it open
with a knife be careful when you're
doing this you don't want to cut
yourself and once you have opened your
EOS up you can remove the product by
just cutting it off and then removing
all of the remainder product once all of
the original US product is out you can
screw the grate back on to the lid this
time and balance the cap onto the body
of the EOS bomb now that all of our
ingredients are melted together we can
now pull this back into the EOS cap once
you have pulled the mixture into your
EOS bomb you want to take this and pop
it into the fridge overnight after a few
hours you can assemble your EOS bomb
back together and when you unscrew your
EOS bomb you should
will your DIY result so now is the day
after and I've just taking these out of
the fridge and I actually messed this
one up a little bit it's not perfect
it's kind of like bumpy and not very
smooth but we'll just go over that so
now for the grand finale we can test
these bad boys out I'm going to be
trying the contouring one first so let's
see how this works they're young okay
this is this is working my goodness that
is very very pigmented
okay I'm not complaining so far let's
blow this thing up
it's lending out pretty easy I would say
and it's not too greasy because of the
cornstarch I feel like it's kind of
mattified it a little bit which is
always good
well it looks really natural and it's
not going patchy is also I'm very
impressed with it so far I think that's
looking pretty good I'm looking sculpted
AF and now we're going to the highlight
let's see if this is as successful as
the contouring one for the poplar on my
cheekbone Oh
Daniel do you see this it's very gold I
feel like I could have added a little
bit more like champagne kind of shimmer
to it so I'm kind of gutted I didn't do
that but I still really like it so I'm
just going to blend this out with my
finger I have to say these products are
really creamy so if you have dry skin
this will be perfect for you if you like
a little bit more of a matte finish I
would suggest to set this in with a
powder this is what the final look looks
like I'm very impressed with how these
work I was kind of skeptical about
making these because I wasn't sure
whether they're going to turn out the
way I want them to but I am really
pleased with how they turned out
sometimes would recommend for you guys
to try these out as well if you guys
enjoyed this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to this channel
as well as my book channel for more
videos like this and comment down below
and let me know what you thought about
this DIY if you think it's worth it or
for think it's a waste of time I feel
like it is quite a bit of effort and
process to get these but once you do
they are really handy to have because I
feel like you can just chuck them in
your handbag and just basically reapply
your contour and highlight on the go so
these are really good for traveling but
anyways that is all from me I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and I'll
see you very soon in my next video
yes this is scar so good and not the
other
