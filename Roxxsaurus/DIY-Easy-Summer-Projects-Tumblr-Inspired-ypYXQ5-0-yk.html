channel I hope you guys are all well
today as you can see I'm doing a summary
DIY kind of video and I'm going to be
sharing with you three different DIY
projects that you can do when you're
bored or if you just feel like being a
little bit creative if you guys enjoy
this type of video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to this channel
as well as my blog channel if you have
never seen this face before and also I
have recently filmed a video over on the
icon UK channel with Layla where she did
my makeup and I was a super fun video so
make sure you guys check that out and
the link will be in the description and
if you guys would like to follow me on
any of my social media my Twitter
Instagram and snapchat are all rocks in
the same way it's not here but without
some dude let's just jump right into the
video
so the first summer DIY is making your
own fruit infused water this is super
super simple but it's so cute especially
for summer parties or picnics so what
you want is just a whole selection of
different fruits that you like and some
mason jars and water the add the water
to your mason jars and then insert all
the fruit you like I kind of went for a
little color scheme in one of them by
just using yellow orange and green fruit
and for the other I just did a
combination of all the different fruits
that I really like so then use pop your
cap back on and that is your fruit
infused water done this is super simple
but it looks so cute and summery
the next DIY is making your own emoji
inspired mason jars / t light holders
whatever you want it to be really so
what you need for this is an empty jar
and you want to pop in some yellow
acrylic paint I actually used a
combination of two different shades and
then I added some water to kind of water
down the consistency of the paint and
once that is done you basically pop the
cap back on and just twirl around your
jar so that the page evenly covers the
whole of the jar to make sure that your
jars dry just place them down upside
down so that the paint drips into the
cap of there and you basically want to
repeat that same step for all of your
jars next are of course the emoji faces
so I went for three of my favorite
emojis the first one is the little kissy
face so I'm just drawing the idol of
some black acrylic paint and the little
kissy mouth along with the heart next to
it
you
I'm then going for the in love emoji I
love this one so so much and this one my
favorites and then the next one is the
grinning happy face which is another
favorite of mine but of course you can
do any emojis that you really like
and that is the finished DIY I really
love how this turned out and you can
literally use these for anything and the
last DIY is creating a very colorful
kind of a Marbley kind of paint splash
effect mugs so for this you're going to
want to place some runny nail-polish
into warm water and then basically you
just splash around all the different
patterns you want to create you can use
different colors just to have fun with
it and then you dip your mug inside and
the pattern will actually stick to the
mug and the finished effect looks super
super cool so I wanted to share that
with you guys so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and found it really summery
and inspiring and if you guys decide to

nighttime regime after dinner I usually
just chill in my bed for the rest of the

relax I get to listen to music that I
like watch show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
