hey guys how's it goin in today's video
is super exciting because I'm going to
show you guys how to create some a DIY
edible school supplies that you can like
sneak into your class and eat wealth
you're hungry I don't know how you guys
thought whenever I was in class I'd
always get a ruining package and like a
break would be like an hour away so I
couldn't really anything but this way
you can totally sneak in food without
your teachers finding out you guys
haven't subscribed already make sure you
do the butternut it down below come and
join the dinosaur family and also I'm
currently holding the back-to-school
giveaway which you guys should
definitely enter all we have to do is
just be subscribe and click the little
notification bell down below to be
notified of every time I post any video
comment down below after you have
clicked the Bell button and the
subscribe button so I can the shout out
some of you guys in my next video
that is enough rambling and let's get on
into the video okay so the first DIY
we're going to be creating today is
these edible pencils that these look so
realistic in my opinion and I'm going to
show you guys how to create these the
first ingredient you're going to use is
some white melted chocolate and I'm
going to add some yellow food coloring
to the chocolate the yellow food
coloring is going to give it that yellow
color of a pencil and you have to be
quite careful with this don't add too
much but also don't add too little
because it is going to start drying up
obviously the food coloring is a lot
colder than the melted chocolate or will
speed up the process of the chocolate
starting to kind of harden so you have
to work quite quickly I'm then going to
take a 6 straw that I actually got from
a over here milkshake from a KFC and I'm
going to put my finger at the end of the
straw and just start pressing the straw
onto the actual chocolate this is going
to start filling up the straw with the
chocolate all the way to the top and
once you have done that you want to put
the straw into a freezer for about half
an hour and this will really harden the
chocolate once the chocolate has settled
and it's cold and hard you want to push
it out of the straw with a sharp object
of some sort and this will just push out
the chocolate and this will be like a
perfect tube of chocolate you don't want
to cut off the ends to make it a little
bit neater the next thing you want to do
is take a starburst and actually use
your same straw to pick a kind of like a
row
circle into the starboard this is going
to be the end of your pencil and it's
going to act as the rubber and then
taking another starburst and splitting
it into a half and I'm going to use this
one as the actual pencil end that has
like the lead in it and stuff and you
want to just stick that onto the other
side next I'm taking some black food
coloring and I'm just doing a tiniest
little dot on the end of the pencil and
also along the rubber end to make it
look and melt them we put together these
pencils are so easy to recreate and they
look so realistic in my opinion I feel
like you definitely be able to fool some
friends at school and even my cat sky I
really like them of course she's a cats
as you can't eat chocolate but she did
try and have a little bite the next DIY
is going to be an edible glue stick I
absolutely love this one so what you're
going to need for this DIY is a print
stick or a glue stick of any kind you're
going to want to empty out the glue
stick packaging completely and then
really wash it and rinse it with some
detergent to make sure that all of the
glue is out and you are not consuming
any of the glue because obviously that's
very bad and they're taking some malwan
blocks you could use starbursts or any
kind of sweet for this but I decided to
go with a bow lamb so I'm just going to
take two out of their packaging and
place them next to each other and then
I'm going to take a glue stick cap and
Pierce a circle through the actual
amount to have a stencil of a round kind
of shape once you have done that you
want to just pop it into the glue stick
and push it all the way down as you can
see this works really well and it will
actually lift it up as you twist the
glue stick and then going to repeat the
same step twice more and this actually
works really really well and this is the
finished product I absolutely love how
it turns out if you pull out this glue
stick in front of some friends they're
going to be so freaked out so this will
be a great prank and for this last DIY
you're again going to need some
chocolate which you're going to want to
melt again and to just spread out into
four different bowls so that you can
create four different colored crayons
I'm now going to take four different
colors of food coloring and just add
that into the bowl of chocolate and mix
it up really well
I'm then going to take some straws once
again like we did with the previous
pencil DIY and I'm going to start
pressing this into the chocolate so that
it fills the straw up all the way to the
top once you're finished your straw
should look something like this which
you then also want to pop into the
fridge to set
once that's happening I'm going to take
a few crayons that are the same
corresponding colors to the ones I've
created and I'm going to start taking
the wrappers off of those that by
cutting a small slit on the back of the
crayon and then taking my chocolate
crayon and I'm just cutting off the end
to make it a little bit more neat and
I'm popping that into the wrapper I'm
going to do this with each of the
crayons that I've created some just
again taking off the wrapper of the
original crayon and popping the
chocolate crayon into the wrapper to
make it look like the real crayon once
all of your chocolate crayons are in the
rapid you can start chiseling away the
end of the crayon that's supposed to
look like a crayon so I'm pretty much
taking a really sharp knife and I'm just
sharpening the end to make it look like
a real crayon and as you can see this is
what the finished Chrome's look like but
you can barely see the difference
between the real and the edible one as
you see these are really easy to
recreate and you'll definitely be able
to fool some of your friends so that is
it for my DIY back-to-school edible
school supplies that is a mouthful I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and found it like entertaining such
interesting to watch because these DIYs
I feel like they turned out so well I
feel like they look really convincing I
don't know about you guys but I think
I've been pretty good you can totally
sneak them into class and like have a
little snacky to get a bit peckish
and also you can like prank your friends
making them think that you're actually
eating school supplies so let me know
