channel I hope you guys little well
today as you picked up from the title as
well as the thumbnail I'm gonna be
making something otherworldly today I'm
gonna be turning this coca-cola bottle
into a giant gummy coca-cola bottle now
I'm personally I'm pretty much addicted
to coke I drink coke like every day it's
really bad so when I saw this on the
internet and on YouTube I was like wow I
need to do this this is my calling in
life and that is why I'm gonna be
filming this DIY for you guys so you
guys can do at home as well also just
Lima by no means am i taking credit for
this I didn't come up with this idea
myself I'm not that clever and it's just
a little bit fun so I thought I would
try to see our white out for you guys so
for this DIY I'm gonna be Zin and this
500 milliliter bottle you can do it with
a 2-liter bottle but I feel like you
would need a hell lot of gelatine for
that so I'm just gonna be taking it with
this little bottle here I'm really
thirsty I kind of really want to drink
it no I'm gonna have fun I like I
actually thought about it so the first
thing you wanna do is pour all of the
coke out into a clean Bowl once you have
emptied up the bottle you now remove the
label we're gonna be using this later
and to take it off you can either rip it
off using your hands or you can use an
exacto knife for more precision let's
see have successfully taken off the
label you can now even exacto knife to
cut a little slit in the center of the
bottle and this is just going to make
the whole removal process afterwards
much easier because we are going to be
placing liquids back into the bottle
you've given the tape up that's lit so
there is no leaking now to create the
jelly consistency first you're gonna
need
milliliters of water place that into a
bowl and then you're gonna place it your
gelatin sachets into the mixture and the
ones I'm using are these six vegetarian
gels have shades and these are for
almost eight fruits and I found these in
the baking section in the video which I
watched as reference for this video the
guy used eight packets I think and I
will put the link for his video down
below as well so the ratio of the
gelatin in compared to the water is
going to be a little bit straight so it
might be quite hard to mix it all up but
just try it best and once it done the
consistency it should resemble that of a
mashed potato once you have finished
mixing it all together you can pop it in
the microwave for about a minute and
this should melt it all together and
make it into a liquid consistency now
you want to take that gelatin mixture
and just pop it into the bowl of coke
that we previously emptied out all those
left to do is mix that all together and
pour it back into the coke bottle and
there to finish off the DIY you just
want to pop that bottle into a fridge
for about an hour if you're living alone
that's fine but if you are living with
family make sure you tell them what
you're doing because it would be
disgusting if they drank that after an
hour you want to take your bottle and
start cutting off the plastic around it
if you cut off the middle section and
start ripping it off it'll be much
easier to pull up the other ends now all
that is left to do is pop over your
original label and a bottle cap to make
it look like a real coke bottle and you
are done I'm pretty sure you could fool
people with it it actually looks so
realistic even the glass of the jelly
looks like the glowing plastic it could
actually really for you that is all for
this video hope you guys enjoyed it I
have to say I am really impressed of how
it turned out this was so fun to make
and it's such a cool little project that
you can do at home only thing I did
wrong was when I was taking the gummy
bottle out of the plastic bottle I kind
of ripped off the bottom part off so it
kind of looks a bit weird but regardless
I still think it looks pretty cool so
that is all for the video I hope you
guys liked it if you did then definitely
