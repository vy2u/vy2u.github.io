channel I hope you guys are all well so
today I have a Halloween hack video for
you guys I'm so excited for this video
Halloween is my favorite season I'm sure
you guys already know that because I've
been making Halloween videos for like
the hold of this month I'm just way too
excited so if you guys are planning on
celebrating Halloween this year or even
if you're not and you just want to know
some really cool Halloween hacks and
this is the perfect video for you if you
guys enjoy this video please be sure to
smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and subscribe to this channel as
well as my blog channel which will be in
the corner just there so you guys can
check that out I'm actually hosting a
Halloween party this year which I'm so
excited about and I'm going to be
vlogging the whole thing so make sure
you guys head over to my blog channel so
you don't miss that and if you guys want
to see any more Halloween or autumn
themed videos from me I'll leave a
little playlist down below so you guys
can check that out so without further
ado let's jam rate of the video so hack
number one is using a cleansing oil to
remove your Halloween makeup so the tip
to remove a really stubborn Halloween
makeup is to use a cleansing oil that's
really hydrating I'm gonna be Zen
defending oil from simple and the makeup
that I'm removing right now is very
heavy and this product is really good at
taking off a really heavy makeup as well
as waterproof makeup this is made from
100% natural grape seed oil which is so
so gentle on the skin and really
hydrates it and leaves the skin
incredibly soft this is really
affordable as well it's only six pounds
ninety-nine and I know that when you
have a full face of Halloween makeup
you're gonna go through a lot of this
product very very quickly the fact that
it's affordable makes it even better and
the fact that this is a cleansing oil
just means that it will deeply cleanse
the pores and it will prevent breakouts
from all of that Halloween makeup once
you are finished with removing the
makeup all you want to do is just rinse
this off with some water you can also
add a little bit of water whilst you are
using the cotton pads and this will turn
the oil into a cleanser which then
really easily rinses away without any
residue pack number two is making your
own DIY Jack Skellington Garland
so for this you're gonna need some
ping-pong balls and needle and some
thread so what I'm doing is I'm just
putting the needle through each of the
ping-pong balls and I'm tying a little
knot at the ends just so that they stay
in place and once that's done what you
want to do is grab a sharpie and just
start drawing on your Skellington faces
I went for different expressions just to
switch it up a little bit but it's up to
you what
you wanna do these are so so cute they
literally are so affordable to make and
they look like they are store-bought
pack number three is making a little DIY
monster treats so what you want to do is
grab a green apple cut it in half cut it
in half again and then start slicing a
little chunk of it in the center out
with a knife then what you want to do is
grab a strawberry and cut it in half
this is going to be the tongue of the
monster I'm then grabbing some sunflower
seeds and just sticking that at the top
of the mouth and this is gonna serve as
the teeth then what you want to do is
just finish this off with some googly
eyes and that is the monster treat
finished hack number four is making some
spooky DIY Halloween drinks you can
either use a soft drink in this for
those of you over 18 this would be a
really cool party idea if you want to
serve shots in these syringes all you
want to do is just take some Fanta or
whatever drink of choice and then you
just want to suck it up into the syringe
and serve it on a Halloween tray the
next hack is making a cute little
serving tray or for some sweets so what
you want to do is cut two oranges and
then empty out the orange from inside
leaving just the peel next what you want
to do is pour some sweets of choice like
skittles or M&amp;amp;Ms and just fill the whole
orange with it you then want to close it
shut and just display it like that these
are so cute because they look like mini
pumpkins and then when you open it up
you have a whole load of sweets hack
number six is making your own DIY blood
so what you need for this is some honey
and some food coloring it's really that
simple and you can make so so much of it
if you need it for your Halloween
costume the texture will be more runny
if you add more food coloring but if you
want it to be more gooey than add more
honey pack seven is creating some
texture in your Halloween makeup you
don't need fancy scar wax with this all
you need is some pretty thick and some
cotton buds so what you want to do is
just apply some glue to your face make
sure it's non-toxic and then apply your
cotton bud and finish this off with some
foundation now this clip actually cut
out but this is what it could look like
once you apply some eyeshadows and red
lipstick and I think it looks so so cool
it adds a lot of texture to the bruise
but those are all of my Halloween hat
slush DIYs I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and found it helpful
if you guys decide to recreate any of
these then please be sure to tag me on
my Twitter or Instagram so I see your
recreations don't forget to give this
video
huge thumbs up if you enjoyed it also I
want you guys to let me know down in the
comments what you guys are dressing up
as for Halloween I'd be really
interested to know I don't actually have
a clue what I'm going to be dressed as
this year but I have to figure it out
pretty soon if you guys don't know what
to dress up as for Halloween I did just
do a DIY Halloween like a last minute
costume video so I'll leave that down in
the description as well as the IT guys
can check that up too and maybe it will
kind of help you out a little bit but
that is all from me I really hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and I'll
see you very soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
