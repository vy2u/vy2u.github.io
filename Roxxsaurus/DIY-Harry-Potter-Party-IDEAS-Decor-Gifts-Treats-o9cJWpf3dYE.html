channel I hope you guys are doing it
super well so in today's video I am
wrapping a Slytherin scarf I also have a
wand and I do also have a snitch so do
you guys know what that means I am going
to be doing a full-on DIY video inspired
all by Harry Potter I know those of you
are full on Harry Potter fans out there
are probably gonna love this video and
even if you're not I think these DIYs
are pretty cool anyways so this DIY
video is all about how to throw your own
Harry Potter inspired party my party is
going to be Christmas themed because
christmas is coming up but literally you
can use this DIY skirt any times a year
it can be for a birthday party for a
Halloween party and you do whatever you
like before I don't try and I just don't
know that you guys know that I'm
actually in Gryffindor but I am wrapping
this scarf as I can't hide my Gryffindor
bun let me know down below what house
you are I would love to find out if you
haven't found out yet make sure you
check it out on the Pottermore website
that's why I did my quiz and that told
me that I was in Gryffindor which I was
very happy about if you guys enjoyed
this video please smash that thumbs up
just down below and also subscribe if
you are brand new I also have a blog
channel where I'm doing a blog with at
the moment so make sure you guys check
that out in the corner just there and I
actually did flog the parties and you
can see all of the DIYs in this video in
there full swing but without oh really
let's get into the video so to make your
very own DIY Harry Potter scarves all
you need is some felt a hot glue gun and
some scissors so the first thing I'm
doing is I'm just cutting the felt into
small squares like so and then I'm going
to hot glue them all together
alternating colors to create a stripy
effect once that's done I'm going to
take my scissors and cut off the edges
of the scarf all the way so that the
scarf is nice and even and then I'm also
going to cut some fringing at the end to
make it look more scarf like to make the
scarf look more authentic I actually
printed out some logos of the houses and
decided to hot glue gun those onto the
scarf as well and this is the finished
effect I think this looks so cute for
photos not necessarily actually to keep
your neck warm or anything but for the
sake of a themed party I think this
works really nicely and it's really
cheap and you to make this next DIY is a
Harry Potter must so this is the DIY
chocolate
now I just took this printout from the
internet and I printed it out and cut it
out and just basically assembled this
together with some glue if you guys want
to create one of these as well I'll
leave the link to the printout in the
description for you guys and now to make
the chocolate frog I actually got this
frog mold off of ebay I think this cost
about six pounds and I basically just
melted some chocolate and put that in
overnight and once the chocolate settled
the next day and this is what the frogs
that looked like the next Harry Potter
tree is another classic so this is
another printer that I go off the
internet and this is the Bertie Botts
every flavor beans to make the packaging
more authentic I added some perspex as
the little windows and then I filled
that in with jelly beans and that is the
finished treat complete this next DIY
are the sorting hat so for this you're
going to need some colored cards and
what you want to do is just draw some
even circles onto that card and then cut
those outs this is going to be the base
of your hat now for the top of the Hat
what you want to do is basically create
a cone out of the triangle and then hot
glue that together now all you want to
do is take some Smarties of the colour
of the house for example red like
Gryffindor and basically just pop that
inside the Hat and seal it shut and now
when you have your guests at your party
you can have them choose their house at
random the next DIY is making some
disposable party cups inspired by the
houses from Harry Potter so you can do
all the different stripes for all the
different houses to do this I'm just
using some regular acrylic paints and
now to really up the game you can also
add some printable logos of each of the
houses and stick them onto the cups this
DIY is so simple and easy to make but it
will definitely make your party so much
more special and it will really impress
your guests
this next DIY is the decor inspired by
the first Harry Potter movie with all
the flying letters so what you want to
do is just write a bunch of these and
create a little seal using some
plasticine then you want to take some
invisible thread and basically just hot
glue that onto the letters the invisible
thread is so invisible that it will make
the letters seem like they are actually
floating and you can just stick them
onto the top of your ceiling and have
all of your guests fooled I think
they're having a party invite in the
form of an acceptance letter is a really
nice touch as I think all of us wanted
to receive one when we were younger I'm
taking a white balloon and I'm basically
just blowing that up and starting to
draw a white owl design on top of it
this is the part where you can get your
artistic skills out but if you're not
artistic you can just use a reference
picture online and that will help a lot
once I finish my design I'm going to
tape some white thread to the top of the
balloon with some sellotape and also do
the same with my letter and this is how
you create your flying owls bringing
your invitations to your guests now
let's be honest a Harry Potter party
would be nothing without butterbeer so
I've just printed out these labels
online and I've stuck them on to my
glass jars and I think they look pretty
cool I found this recipe online what you
need is some cream soda some vanilla and
some salted caramel flavor so I'm just
pouring in the cream soda into the cup
and then adding a tablespoon of the
vanilla and also a tablespoon of the
salted caramel flavor mixing all that
together and here you are your very own
butter beer the next DIY is another
really simple one but really effective
at the same time what you want to do is
take some Farrow Roche and just add some
paper wings to them this instantly
transforms them into golden snitches how
cool is this DIY honestly now once you
get an I mean students arrive at your
party you don't want to leave them
empty-handed now do you so this really
easy DIY transforms regular pencils into
wands instantly all you need is some old
pencils and some hot glue you want to
create some patterns onto the wands and
just paint them with some acrylic paint
so I've just used some Brown
gold paint and this is how the finished
ones look like a wizard
so since christmas is just around the
corner I thought I would also make some
Harry Potter inspired tree ornaments so
I'm taking some white acrylic paint and
I'm just painting out some very typical
Harry Potter classical kind of ideas
I've taken a lot of inspiration from
Pinterest so thanks Pinterest these
turned out so so cool they look amazing
on my Christmas tree also if you guys
would like to make a snitch for your
Christmas tree all you need is a God for
Vil and some white feathers that you can
just hot glue onto the bauble and that
is literally all you have to do so that
is all for my DIY Harry Potter party
inspired video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you did make sure you
smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and I'm literally obsessed with

use them every day but if you guys
