I hope you guys are doing super well the
internet video I attribute exchange
ideas you look how you get inspired by
life I think we have a little look on
her merchandise look light and she
absolutely killing it I am love it like
have fun casing and had cats they look
really cool I'm going to notice is that
they are a little bit pricey so I
thought why not friend me feed myself
and they can be really go touch creepy
similar DIY studio original merchandise
and get them for so much cheaper you
have two of my favorite DIY that I
created in this video on a CD look so
here they look like the store-bought and
honestly expert less than 10 pounds to
make each of these DIY this is so good
and so affordable if you guys enjoy this
video make sure you smash you some love
this down below and also subscribe if
you are brand new I pursue it twice a
week and only have a slob channel which
is rock surahs love I'll leave that in
the corner where I post a lot of my baby
knife on there so if you guys haven't
subscribed yet make sure when you do but
if you guys would like to see some kind
of inspired DIY mmm let's give another
video so the first DIY is a nail art
inspired by Kylie Jenner this is
actually inspired by an instagramer
called oh my G I'll leave a link to her
Instagram down below she recently did
these nails on her Instagram and I
absolutely fell in love so I thought
this would be a great little DIY for
those of you Kylie fans out there it's
so simple to make all you need is some
white nails and then paint these black
splatters over at the ends and they just
look so so cool
the next DIY is a Kylie Jenner phone
case so this is actually inspired by a
phone case that she is selling on her
merchandising website and it's just the
typical logo of her lip kits and I
basically just printed this out on a
piece of paper and I cut it out and then
placing this inside a clear phone case
and that is the DIY finished so the next
DIY phone case what you're going to need
is a black phone case and some white
paint so the paint I'm using is actually
acrylic and what I'm doing is I'm just
painting on the splatter effect in white
I actually figured that you could also
do this with some white nail polish if
you don't have any white acrylic paint
and those are the finished phone cases
the next Kylie inspired DIY is pipe in
badges that on her website she's selling
a set of four different pins for $20
which i think is kind of pricey you can
definitely make these yourself for so
much cheaper you need is these clear
dome shapes kind of stickers I got this
on eBay for literally like three pounds
you don't just want to print off some
pictures in the side of your sticker and
basically place a sticker on top and cut
around the edge now to make these clear
domes
into an actual badge all you need is a
safety pin and you want to just hot glue
that onto the back and here you have a
whole set of Kylie Jenner inspired
badges that you can put on your backpack
or your jackets to spice them up but its
current form a nice DIY you're going to
need another printout of the kind lips
and this image maker transfer kind of
glue so what you want to do is brush on
the image make up on cute and Kylie lips
and then place this onto some white
fabric wide fabric works best because
you can clearly see the image once I've
dry you want to pass off the back of the
image with a wet sponge this is going to
make it peel off much easier so what you
want to do is to scrub off the rest of
the paper and here you have a printed on
image onto your fabric you don't want to
cut this out and just attach it onto a
black cap and here you have your very
own Kylie caps for less than ten pounds
so this is what the final product looks
like and here we also have the gorgeous
Leila rose modeling this hat for me so
you guys can see what it looks like on a
different hair color and for the last
DIY you're going to need these clear
keychains and also some printouts of the
Kylie
so this isn't actually a much that she
sells but I thought this was quite a
cool idea so all you need is just to
print out of her logos or Kylie like the
ones on her t-shirts and then you just
want to pop that inside and here you
have your very own Caillou keychain so
that's all for this video I really hope
you guys enjoyed yet I am honestly so
happy with how these DIYs turned out

pounds of make which is amazing you guys
