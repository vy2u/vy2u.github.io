channel I hope you guys all well so
state Halloween is just around the
corner which I'm so excited about I
thought I would show you guys how to
create 4 different DIY costumes they're
super affordable to make and they're
also more appropriate for those of you
who don't like to dress up as something
really scary because they are quite cute
and not scary at all so if you guys
enjoyed this video please be sure to
smash that huge thumbs up down below and
subscribe to this channel as well as my
blog channel which is rocks Laura's
vlogs it's just in the corner there so
you guys can check that out already
let's jump right into this so for the
first class human gonna need it here
branches a headband and also some
masking tape first step you want to take
is basically wrap the sellotape around
the headband as well as the branch to
attach the two together I found that
this was quite difficult to do when you
didn't cut off the sellotape so I would
suggest to first cut off the sellotape
from the actual roll and then roll this
around it just makes life so much easier
but basically what you want to do is
just keep wrapping the styler tape
around the branch then this is going to
give it a really nice and shiny texture
and you won't be able to tell that it's
actual branches once your antlers are
finished you want to move on to the
makeup portion so you want to take a
bronzer and really bronze up the face
most of your cheekbones and your temples
you also want to contour your nose as
well as the hollows of your eyes now I'm
reaching for a highlight this is the
maybelline contour and highlight stick
and I'm just basically highlighting my
cheekbones my nose bridge and my
forehead next I'm going to be creating
the reindeer nose so I'm using a black
eyeliner for this I'm also going to take
that black eyeliner and accentuate my
inner corners with this to make my eyes
appear more animalistic next I'm taking
the same contour stick that I used
previously
I'm just creating little white dots
around the cheekbone area and this is
really going to give it that reindeer
effect listen this makeup is so so
simple but I think it's really cute now
all there's left to do is put on a all
brown outfit and you are good to go
the next DIY we're going to be creating
is a Minnie Mouse a headband so firstly
I'm taking some scissors and I'm cutting
out the foam in two ear shapes and I'm
taking the first ear or as the stencil
for the second one so that they are
identical next what you want to do is
take your ears and cut them into a
rounded edge so that they fit the
headband a lot better I'm now going to
take some super glue and attach the ears
onto the headband
once that's done I'm taking some red
felt and I'm starting to fold this into
like a harmonica shape so I'm folding
one side flipping it over folding it
again and then flipping it over and
folding it again and once that's done
I'm taking another thin strand of red
felt material and I'm wrapping this
around the middle of our bow now I'm
just cutting off the edges to make the
bow look more rounded and this is the
finished bow moving on to the makeup
this one is super simple all you want to
do is draw a round circle on the tip of
your nose like Minnie Mouse's
and apply some red lipstick to finish
off the look you want to put on
something black or polka dot or red and
this is the Minnie Mouse look complete I
love this one so so much I think it's my
favorite it's so simple to do the next
DIY is a unicorn costume don't we all
love unicorns yes we do so what you want
for this is some card and you want to
cut this into like a triangular cone
shape fold this into a round cone and
glue this together next I'm taking some
white felt and I'm just going to wrap
this around the cone to add a little bit
of detail to our horn and I think this
adds a really nice touch
now we're just gonna glue this onto the
headband and that is the unicorn
headband done moving on to the wings I'm
using the same metallic cardboard and
I'm mapping out the shape of my wings
and then cutting it out I'm using the
first wing as a stencil for the second
one so that they are identical next I'm
repeating the same step but I'm making
the wing slightly smaller we're
basically creating three layers of the
wings to add a little bit of dimension
to the wings moving on to the unicorn
makeup what you want to do is just apply
some pink lipstick some pink blush and a
heck load of highlight you are basically
recreating the highlight challenge for
this makeup you just want to have a
really nice glow to your face
that's very unicorn like and the last
DIY is a wind-up doll so for this you're
going to need a gold or bronze cardboard
sheet the first thing you want to do is
cut out a rectangle and and roll this up
into a tube and glue it together next
you want to draw out the spinny kind of
I don't really know what this is called
but it's like a wind-up portion of the
wind-up doll so you want to do that and
it kind of looks like an eight I suppose
so then you want to just cut this out
now I'm making a little tab to attach
the number eight to the tube and I'm
gluing this together with superglue
once that's done you just want to glue
this to a belt and that is the finished
DIY moving on to the doll makeup I'm
going to be applying some pink lipstick
I'm also going to be drawing some lines
coming down from the corners of my mouth
to my chin and this basically replicates
the look of a ventriloquist doll I'm
also going to add some freckles to my
face using a brown liner and I'm also
going to apply some pink blush to finish
off the look and that is the finished
DIY it's so so simple but it's so cute
I've never seen anyone dressed up as a
wind-up doll like honestly it's such a
cool idea as always if you guys enjoyed
