channel I hope you guys oh well so as
you guys know fall / autumn is one of my
favorite seasons ever and it's just the
beginning event today I have some DIY
hacks for you guys for fall / autumn and
I'm so excited to share these with you
guys because some of these are literally
life savers if you guys enjoyed this
video please be sure to give it a huge
thumbs up and subscribe to this channel
as well as my blog channel rocks auras
vlogs I'm also gonna link down below my
previous full / autumn video it was the
types of girls at Halloween video I
found that videos oh so much fun to film
but without further ado let's jump right
into the video
so half number one is preventing your
candles from burning out really quickly
I don't really know how this works but
it does actually work so when I freeze
my color and then liked it afterwards it
doesn't burn out as quickly I don't know
what it is like science time number two
is also about cents and you can actually
create your own diffuser slash wax
burner so what you're gonna need for
this is some coconut oil some pumpkin
spice or cinnamon or vanilla whatever
kind of smell you want your house to be
smelling like mix them all together and
then pop them into your wax burner this
is so easy I actually didn't know about
this only when I started researching
autumn hacks online I was like wow you
can actually make your own wax burner
and also if you're worried about having
chemicals burning in your house you
don't have to worry about this one at
all because you know all of the
ingredients aren't natural hack number
three is creating your own pumpkins out
of peppers this is like way more
affordable and less messy if you don't
want to buy a whole pumpkin not only can
use this as a decoration but you can
also use it as a side of a meal you can
stuff this pepper with rice or just
anything that you like really it's super
simple but really cute and really
affordable the next tag is all about
dark lipstick we know fall and autumn is
like the season of dark lipstick and a
lot of us come across this problem of
having like the middle part of your
lipstick fade really quickly if you eat
or drink you guys may already know of
this but I found a good way to combat
that so what you need to do is apply
your lipstick is regular you don't want
to blow off the oil from your lipstick
and then powder over the top then apply
your lipstick again over the top to the
middle section of the lipstick where we
blotted it off and also powdered over
the top is going to really lock that
color
place in the last day of lipstick that
we popped over the top is going to act
as that moisturizing layer if you guys
haven't tried this out before you
definitely shared because it leaves my
lipstick lasting for so much longer the
next tag is for those of us who suffer
with really cold hands during autumn my
hand gets so so cold and I never like
wearing gloves because they're just get
in my way to combat this you can
actually make your own DIY pocket hand
warmers what are you going to need for
this is some fabric of choice some
thread and a needle the first step you
want to do is cut the fabric down to the
size that you want make sure they are
quite small so you can fit them into the
pockets of your clothes once you have
your size you want to make sure that the
fabric is on the wrong side and start
stitching the three sides of the fabric
once that's done you want to pop some
rice inside it you want to kind of go
maybe 3/4 of the way and stitch your
little pouch shots
I'm then going to repeat the same
process and make another one i Dont'a
have your two rice pouches what you want
to do of them is just pop them into your
microwave for about 15 seconds and that
will warm them up right away this is
totally safe just make sure you don't
leave them in there for way too long
and once they're out they should be
really nice and toasty and you can place
them in your pocket and warm up your
hands on the go and the best part is you
can actually reuse them over and over
again the next time is for our pumpkin
decorations so once we have carved a
pumpkin you might have noticed that they
Rock quite easily and quite quickly so
to prevent this from happening and
making your pumpkins last much longer
what you want to do is delete some
bleach with water and spray this into
the pumpkin as well as on the outside
every other day the bleach in the water
will kill the bacteria in the pumpkin
that usually makes it rot really quickly
and last hack is such a simple one but I
literally have only started doing this
recently and it's basically to put your
clothes over your radiator overnight so
when you wake up your cloves are really
nice and toasty there's literally
nothing worse than getting up in the
morning and having to put on like really
cold jeans do you know what I mean so
this hag is literally a lifesaver so
there's all my autumn DIY hacks I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
find it helpful let me know down below
which one of these was your favorite and
also let me know what is your favorite
part of our autumn down
in the comment I think my favorite part
about autumn is like the really nice
smells like pumpkin spice and apple
spice and just being like really cozy
and like cozy jumpers and Halloween
obviously so that is all from me I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you very soon in my next
one bye hi Jodie just whose bibs I don't
think she has my phone safe like I think
I got her number but she never got mine
