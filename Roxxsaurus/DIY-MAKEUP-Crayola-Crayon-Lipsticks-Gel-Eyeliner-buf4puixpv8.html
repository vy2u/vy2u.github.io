hi guys so today I'm going to be showing
you how to do DIY lipsticks and eyeliner
and I'm going to be using these crayons
for the lipsticks and these are the
Crayola Crayons they're not toxic so you
can use them like around your mouth and
it won't cause any hazards or harm kids
usually eat these so the not hasn't
basically and the fun thing is you can
make any color that you like because
there is 24 in this pack it depends what
pack you buy but here I've got so many
colors to choose from and yes so I'll be
showing you how to do two formats one is
the lipstick format which unscrews like
this basically like the lipstick it's
this gorgeous kind of nude / orange
peach color I really love it and the
next one is in a lip gloss kind of
format so if you just put it in a tiny
little part and spoil your finger around
in it so yes stay tuned to watch how I
did it
you
so the first thing you're going to do is
you're going to take your boiling pan
and fill it up just at the bottom with
some water and boil it whilst you're
preparing at the rest and here I'm just
taking this peachy nude color and
unwrapping it from the wrapper this is
probably the most tricky part of the
tutorial
next I'm just going to snap it in three
parts so that it's easier for it to melt
and I'm placing it into the jar now you
can just place the jar into the boiling
water so that the crayon can melt this
might take a while so please be patient
once the crayon has somewhat melted you
can now move on to the coconut oil and
adding a spoonful of that is just going
to create a really nice texture to the
lipstick as well as give it shine and
moisture
here I'm taking the petroleum jelly and
this is just going to add more moisture
and petroleum jelly is usually used in
lip balms so it's a key ingredient so
now that all the ingredients are in the
jar you can stir it until it's a nice
watery consistency so here I'm just
pouring in the liquid I find it quite
easy to pour it straight from the jar
but if you find it a bit tricky you can
use a spoon so when you're pouring the
liquid be sure to use some sort of
kitchen cloth just because the jar will
be very hot from the boiling water the
last step is to put the product into the
fridge so that it can cool down and
harden overnight or just for a few
minutes here we are your very own DIY
lipsticks in any color then you could
ever want I really like the texture of
these and the pigment - they're a great
substitute for all the really expensive
lipsticks out on the market and you can
make as many as you want
moving on to the second DIY makeup item
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to create this gel eyeliner now guys I
kind of went overboard with the
petroleum jelly so just turned out a
little too watery then I thought I would
like it too so just learn for my mistake
and don't put petroleum jelly like all
in one go just keep adding it till you
get the right consistency that you like
so let's get started
so first things first you need to
consider where you're going to work
because this process can get kind of
messy so you need to work in a place
where you don't mind getting dirty the
first step is to grab your tool and
scrape out most of the black eyeshadow
that you can get onto a little plate
where you're going to mix it with the
petroleum jelly adding the petroleum
jelly is probably the hardest part of
this tutorial because if you put in too
little the consistency is going to be
very dry however if you put in too much
is going to become really watery so I
advise for you to just put in bit by bit
so you get the consistency just right
for you
the next step is very self-explanatory
all you have to do is just mix the two
ingredients together very thoroughly so
that there is no see-through petroleum
jelly once you feel you have mixed the
product enough you can now convert to
enter your little container using your
tool if you didn't make enough product
to fit the whole container you can just
mix it around and create an illusion of
a fuller product
so since this eyeliner is obviously DIY
you kind of have to bear in mind that
the lasting properties I'm going to be
the same as a factory-made eyeliner so
um to kind of set the eyeliner and get
rid of the shine from the petroleum
jelly you can just to use black
eyeshadow over the top which is what I
did and that will just help it stay not
smudge and not budge for out the day for
wearing it if you decide to make this so
if you decide to recreate any of the to
DIY makeups I would love for you to
tweet it to me so I could have a look
and my Twitter down below if you'd like
to do that and yeah I hope you enjoy
this video and I'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
