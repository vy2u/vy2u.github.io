channel I hope you guys at well today
I've got a really exciting video for you
guys I'm going to be testing out this
weird beauty product so I want to turn
this into like a local series of me
testing out weird beauty products so let
me know of any other weird products that
you see on the internet all the time and
you want me to test out so today I'm
going to be testing out this little bad
boy and this isn't the peel-off lip
stain the splash lip tint so I've seen
pictures of this on the internet and
some people do videos about this so I
was intrigued by it and I wanted to test
it out myself
so for those of you who don't know what
this is it's basically like a really
thick paste and you put on your lips you
wait for it to dry and then you peel it
off and you're supposed to be left with
this really beautiful stain on your lips
make sure you stay to the end of this
video because I'm also going to be
showing you how to create a DIY version
of this so you don't have to buy it if
you can't be bothered to wait for the
shipping so I actually got this on eBay
for about a pound it's looting shipping
so it's not expensive but if you want to
try all the shades then it could
potentially get quite expensive so I
will show you guys the way to make this
at home and hopefully it works if you
guys enjoyed this video then definitely
leave a thumbs up and subscribe to this
channel as well as my blog channel and
without probably less you should praise
in the video okay so before you try out
this product I do recommend for you guys
to moisturize and scrub your lips so I
love using my Boehm scrub from lush just
to get rid of any dead skin on my lips
because you don't want that
okay so I've just scrubbed my lips like
hell it literally feels like I've scrub
all the skin away and there's no skin my
lips left but that's exactly what you
want because you don't want like any
dead skin with it and now for the fun
part
we can try the product and I choose like
this sexy red color so you guys can see
here the best I don't know whether to
apply it directly from the tube or like
use my finger or brush I don't really
want to
ruin a brush I think I'm just going to
apply it straight from the tub to safe
like hassle and mess oh I'm so scared
because this oh my god okay terrific
I'm really scared because this won't
come off straight away so if I go
outside the lines then I'm screwed I'm
going to get up close and personal so
you guys can see better it's kind of
like guiding my lips and that's supposed
to happen it feels like blood like
Halloween oh no it went away T yeah
listen to really stinging I know good on
my team I hope this doesn't stain Ont
okay so I feel like I can't talk
properly because if I touch whether it's
together they're gonna stay really
hoping this comes out all right because
I didn't really get like a straight line
because the applicator is quite hard to
work with I'm going to go in with a
brush now because I feel like the edge
is just gonna look horrendous so I'm
gonna just touch that up okay so I'm
going to be talking really weird and for
a little while because I'm trying not to
get my lips to tuck but I just line my
lip but with a rush to get like the more
precision I'm sounding so weird when I'm
talking like this I've got the loads on
my teeth but I think it's stains on
teeth red so that's not good
but yeah I'm just gonna wait this to dry
and then I will come back okay so I'm
back it's been about five minutes and
this has already started to peel off
without my permission so I'm going to
peel it right off
so this is what it looks like that is my
lip for right now
woof ooh pick it that was good all right
so let's pull off at the bottom as well
so that is what it looks like
I'm actually pretty impressed this is
really cool Oh as there are teeth
there's still probably a little bit more
teeth so let's not talk about that but
look how missing that is that is really
really pigmented I didn't expect it to
be this pigmented to be honest I feel
like it's a little bit more pigmented on
my bottom lip especially around where
like the inside of my mouth is because
it's obviously a little bit more dry
skin now and it's obviously going to
cling to that area a little bit more
overall I didn't see any like harsh
lines you know Xhosa
okay maybe at the top a little bit can
you see yeah Yuriy downside is of course
getting on your teeth but that's just me
being clumsy and also I got loads on my
hand which is now stained my hand red
and looks like I've been on a killing
spree and now for the real test let's
see if this stain is kiss proof okay
that's not bad
can you guys see that I feel like that's
just some of the remainder products from
inside my lip but apart from that all
around the outside is like a non budging
you're like a word and now I'm going to
try and take this stain off so that I
can show you how to do the DIY version
okay so I have not attempted to remove
this and it has removed most of it but
there is still a little bit of staying
right in the center of my lip and also
there's still stains on my hands so
still we feel like I see okay but now we
can move on to the DIY part of this
video so the two things you're going to
need for this are some red food coloring
or any food coloring of your choice I'm
using red so that it's like an
equivalent shade to the original product
and the second ingredient you're going
to need is some PVA glue make sure it's
non-toxic first though I'm going to be
eating it anyways as fine what you wanna
do is take a little
hanging out and pop into the container
you're glue you don't need a lot because
this is going on your lips unless you
have Kylie Jenner lips you're not going
to need loads of this so I just
literally put in this much of the glue
you don't need a lot at all then I'm
gonna put it in the red food coloring
this is the scary part okay I say little
but itit should put like half of the
bottle in there right anyway I'm gonna
start mixing the mixture together and
then I put way too much I'm going to
need to put some more glue in to kind of
balance out the consistency I have to
say this doesn't smell the best so try
not to smell them
okay so now you make sure it's done you
can stop the Tinder's on to your lips
okay so my DIY lip pilaf is now on I'm
trying to talk like a crazy person so
that one looks don't touch but yes I'm
going to leave this on to dry for a few
minutes
and I'm going to come back okay so my
dear white lip stain is now dry and it's
actually started peeling off in the
corners of my lips I'm gonna peel it
right off
so this is what my lips look like after
the DIY peel off I feel like the color
is much at the less a prominent and
pigmented because we did use a food
coloring but I feel like I can still see
a lot of pink around the edges of my
lips and especially in the very middle
but I do have to say I feel like the
actual original product to works much
better than the DIY version so overall I
give this weird VG product a 8 out of 10
because well it did work it did leave a
lot of stain on my hands and my teeth
but that's obviously my bad and just
leave you clumsy so apart from that I
really love the product and I would
recommend for you guys to try it out
that is all for this video if you guys
enjoyed it then definitely leave it a
thumbs up a very red thumbs up if you
