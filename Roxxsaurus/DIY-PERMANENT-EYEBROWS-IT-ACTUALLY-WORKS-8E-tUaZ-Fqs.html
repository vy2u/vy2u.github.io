channel how are you all doing I hope you
guys are doing really well let me go
down on the comments below how your day
was because I'm nosy and I don't know
what you guys got up to today is an
exciting video I feel like I say that
was at the time but this time it
actually is exciting because I'm testing
out in wonder brow - this is a one-cent
brow gel for perfect eyebrows that last
for days I don't know how you but that
sounds pretty appealing and very
promising to me but we have faces the
video make sure you guys are subscribed
I would love to have you here to join it
behind the school family you have so
much fun around here so make sure you
hit that subscribe button down below and
also I have a blog channel I feel like a
lot of you don't know this but we've
just hit a hundred K on rocks Laura's
one it's honestly insane I am so
thankful to every single one of you I
feel like my blog channel it's like this
little baby that I've grown from the
bottom again and it was so much fun and
I honestly love of blogging for you guys
so if you guys would like to see what I
kind of get up to on a daily basis make
sure you head over to rocks or as log if
you guys enjoyed this video make sure
you smash that thumbs up just down below
it helps me out a lot because then I
know what kind of videos you guys want
me to do on this channel but without
further ado let's get into the video ok
so inside the box here in the Wonder
graph - you get it - of things you get
the eyebrow gel which is a really nice
cool tone shade on that most so you have
like a little color chart
what eyebrow color would suit your hair
color the best and this just happened if
you see my colored base which I feel
like is a pretty close match so good job
on the rails
good job and also this is cool toned
which I'm pretty surprised about because
a lot of these products that you find
online they kind of never really the
right shades or sometimes a little bit
too yellow customize surprise I feel
like this will be a good shade and a lot
of the gel and you also get a little
spoolie to brush out your eyebrows and
life is really hard because sometimes
some people may not have this so the
fact that it comes in life a little set
in really nice but I'm going to show you
some actually come with the set I have
to buy this separately and this is the
Wonder cleanse this is pretty much
what's going to actually remove your
eyebrows if you make a mistake or once
you're like done with the eyebrows you
don't know where them anymore you can
use them to really cleanse them off
because that's what it claims that it's
not going to be able to like to be
removed by any makeup removers or water
or anything like that I purchased this
just in case because I feel like if I
make a mistake it's going to be quite
permanent for a few days so in the box
you also get a little leaflet and on
here it just basically said to start the
process of appliances one Dubrow to
clean and dry eyebrows I have nothing on
in my eyebrows at the moment I have
obviously makeup on but nothing on my
eyebrows this is what the Wonder brow
product looks like it comes in like a
little mascara almost tube and it also
has this little like brush applicator
which kind of resembles that of like a
lip gloss applicator or something and
actually not going to use a bit
applicator that's in here I'm going to
use a little angled brush this one is
from at Lille England I actually love
these brushes so I'm going to use that
for a little bit more precision okay so
I'm going to jump straight in I'm just
going to apply this to my eyebrow as I
usually would put any eyebrow product
I'm going to pick them all off of the
brush apply it to my own brush I feel
like I need a mirror for that
hold on if I really need you guys in so
you can really see what's going on up
here
just going to start off with my arch so
the products is very liquidy and it's
pretty easy to apply I feel like I'm
firing off of my arts because I was kind
of scared that I would add too much
product into like the beginning of my
eyebrows I'm just going to start with my
arch and the tail and then move on to
the beginning of the brow I feel like
this is a pretty close match to what I
would usually apply to my eyebrow it's
not too warm which is really good
because I was kind of scared that it
would be a little bit too warm whereas
my hair color and my eyebrows are lit
bit more on the exercise so for any
blondes or brunettes out there who needs
a bit more of an ashy coat I feel like
this product is perfect
women need a little bit more layers to
kind of build up on the color because up
here I feel like it's a little bit too
light in color almost my eyes are a
little bit darker than that I feel like
it's not covering it too well but I'm
going to add a few more layers on when
it dries and see what happens I'm going
to move on to this part of my brow now I
am a little bit scared this could be
very permanent right I'm going to go
underneath the brow now the most intense
moment in my life I'm literally like not
breathing right now oh okay okay I feel
like that is looking good and looking it
I'm going to try and feather it out to
the beginning of my brows I don't want
it to look too harsh I'm going to use
the little spoon II that they provided
in the box just to kind of blend
everything together and get rid of any
harsh lines once it started drying it
does go a little bit hard so you kind of
have to brush your brows constantly
before it dries to really make sure that
it's set in the right place I feel like
this brow has come out a little bit
bolder than I usually would have it but
I thought I could still look okay and
once I've done the other brow I feel I
feel that's fine I'm just and over to
the car eyebrows it's fine I'm not going
to be most of the second brow and throw
that in it the same way
ok so these are the finished brows I
feel like I did an okay job of feeding
them out in the center here
it was quite tricky I'm not gonna lie
but I feel like once you do it more and
more it's going to get quite easy to get
the hang off I'm not going to wait for
about two minutes to let everything
right out the supply and then I'm going
to do this much prettier so I just
divide the eyebrow guys they look really
good I'm not gonna lie I am really
impressed with the color I thought it
would be a little bit yellow but then
not actual they're really actually which
unreal preps were destroying our clothes
what I'm checking with you guys to show
you what they look like and how it's
going but we'll get back to filming
ourselves btz okay guys I am back the
brows are now thoroughly dried and I'm
just going to touch them real quick to
see what they feel like they feel like I
have a lot of a brow gel on I'm not
going to lie there do you feel a little
bit stiff but now for the smudge proof
test I'm just going to try my fingers to
see what happens there is listening
nothing coming off it hasn't even ruined
my brow or anything I'm going to try and
like smudge it like this there is
literally nothing coming off oh my god
there's literally nothing coming off on
my fingers I'm going to grab a piece of
tissue and see if this will come off
there is literally nothing on the tissue
do you freaking see this there is
nothing on the tissue after home believe
this is pretty much nothing on this
piece of tissue there's nothing on my
fingers
it is literally smudge proof that is
insane I wonder what the heck is in this
product because I need that for like my
eyeliner my lipstick like I need that
for everything one Dubrow you should
really come up with a whole range of
products I'm going to grab a wet tissue
now and see if there's anything on an
actual makeup removing wipes okay here
we go
I need you okay there is literally
nothing on here and this is designed to
remove like waterproof makeup oh my god
I cannot believe it it still looks so
good how the heck is this happening okay
I am thoroughly impressed with it I am
probably going to be eating this every
single day
oh wait I'm not going to need to because
this is probably going to last me for
like two or three days imagine the
possibilities like you could go swimming
you could go into a sauna and your
eyebrows would never come off that is so
good the last thing I'm going to try is
the wonder cleanse to see how well this
will actually take off my makeup I mean
if this didn't even work and I will stop
with these eyebrows forever now not on
our minds but they would probably get a
little bit crusty after a while
so this is the wonder cleanse I'm going
to just apply it onto my hand oh it's
like a clear gel consistency duck call
I'm gonna have to pick up on my finger
and see how well this will take off my
eyebrow oh it's coming off pretty well
actually
whoa look at all the product that was
all on my eyebrow and it was not budging
until I applied the wonder cleanse so
cool this is me before and after I feel
like this is taken off the whole of the
brow very well so I'm definitely glad
that I purchased this as well so as a
verdict of this product is that it's
definitely what and I would a hundred
percent recommend it to you guys because
like look at it it's freaking amazing
but that is all for this video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and found it
helpful if you are planning on trying
this product out let me know down in the
comments below I am honestly so so
impressiveness I did not think that this
will work as well as it did but I'm
definitely going to be using this more
often for sure make sure you can see the
zero sums up if you would like to see
more videos like this of me testing our
products that I kind of stumble upon on
the internet and make sure you guys
subscribe if you're brand new I would
love to have you here come and join the
dinosaur family you can stay as long as
you like that is all from me I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and I'll
see you very soon in my next video
