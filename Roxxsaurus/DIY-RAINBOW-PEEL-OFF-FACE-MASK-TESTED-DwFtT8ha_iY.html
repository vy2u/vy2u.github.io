channel I hope you guys are doing it
super well and also how long have you
knew people who have just subscribed
thank you so much for joining the
dinosaur family so today we have a very
exciting video we are going to be
testing out the DIY rainbow up peel-off
mask now if you guys have been here for
a little while you'll know that I have
done a video like this in the past and I
was using the charcoal pill and you guys
seem to have loved that video so so much
although it was a little bit of a fail
it went pretty wrong and it hurt like
how like it was slightly painful though
today is going to be a good idea to
basically put myself through that pain
again and try to recreate some video for
you guys I have seen this video on the
YouTube like scattered around if you
should have done this already so I'm not
going to claim that this video idea
Absalon is testing this video out for
you guys so you can see if it actually
if you guys enjoy this video make sure
you must excuse thumbs up just down
below it helps me out so much I
challenge you guys to try and get this
video to 30,000 likes can we do it I
think we can I think we can do it also
make sure you guys don't subscribe to
you as my blog Channel as well as this
channel if you haven't already occurred
twice a week one year and about three or
four times on my blog channel I recently
met you you need and honestly it was
like the best experience ever which I
just love so if you guys want to see
that I'll leave it in the mystical eye
as well as like somewhere around this
video because honestly it was such a
cool experience anyway if you guys want
to see how to recreate the rainbow DIYs
peel-off mask then let's get to it okay
so the first thing you're gonna need is
some acrylic paint it was cool paid and
it's acrylic and it's washable and also
the main part is that it's non-toxic you
don't want to put any like toxic paints
on the skin unless the other thing these
paint I'm just there to add the color of
the rainbows and for it to look cool I
don't think it actually has any benefit
to the skin at all I need its acrylic
paint it's not going to do anything to
your skin and the certain ingredient you
don't need is the PVA glue
which is going to be like the base and
the peeling off effect of the mass
identified Elmer's glue so I got this
attack glue instead and this is going to
work just as well cuz they're both PVA
glue but they're just fight it from run
so the first thing you want to do is
basically lay out all of the colors of
the paint onto a place or a tray that
you don't mind getting paint on you
don't want to take you on the blue and
mix that into each of the colors once
everything is really nicely binded and
mixed together and that is the face mask
finished and it's ready to apply okay so
I know how all of my DIY peel-off mask
assembled the kind of all merging
together but that's okay so now I'm just
ago seen my face for a little bit I am
wearing eye makeup and eyebrows just to
clarify but I'm going to steam my face a
little bit just so that might cause open
up and that might was the ghost can be
pulled out if this actually work so I
have just seen my face a little bit and
I'm now going to apply the face mark I'm
going to be using this little Real
Techniques foundation brush to apply and
I'm going to go in growth along my face
like this and I'm gonna basically
replicate the order of the rainbow I'm
gonna make sure you guys can hair up
into a ponytail or something because you
do not want my glue going in your hair
you do not own that ass okay I'm going
to begin by applying the purple color
right in the center of my face and
please pray for me this could go so
wrong
oh so cold I just realized that she's so
not be using it for that hold on a
minute a gallon era a gallon eras
we're going to define up sliders as
neatly as possible but it just appears
that I have not got that kind of skill
everything is funny like this I have to
say this isn't a gloopy as the other one
was but I feel like the first time I did
this kind of face mask with blue I just
added way too much glue I wish you won't
hand with it and that is why I think it
in was I'm really hesitant to put it
around my mouth narrow because I know
it's going to kill to take this ugly Oh
what the heck I'll do it I'll do it be
that I - Mon line here I feel like these
two bits can be like a pretty thick
facial hair
and this is an impatient hairstyle for
Movember take a guide ok guys so the
face mask is now complete I have all of
the colors of the rainbow and honestly
my face feels so tight right now like
all of this area here is just so so
stiff like a con even smaller because I
can feel that cracking a legend yes you
know at the beginning of the video I
said make sure you tie your hair up
because you do not want the paint or the
glue going in your hair well and after
you're afraid that were meant really is
that you kind of either need to have no
hair on your head or you need to our
bold card cut even though I tie my hair
up somehow some ways there are still
hair sticking onto - so another way base
is incapable of facial expressions and
little bit like Bella from Twilight I am
going to go off camera and wait for this
bad boy to dry so I can come back and
show you guys what it looks like 20
minutes later hey guys so I'm now back I
feel like my face has started cracking
far much around my chin and I honestly
cannot move it so I think it's about
time I feel this thing up I know I
should be peeling it up first but the
way it started to peel off it kind of
didn't let me but while I did so cool I
feel like the rainbow one won't show the
result as well as the black charcoal
peel-off mask did you give the contrast
of the black charcoal and the black head
is like really big whereas this you kind
of can see it a little bit so this is
what it kind of looks like I don't think
you guys will be able to actually see
what came off of my skin but I'm going
to try and get some shots with my iPhone
and get some like macro shot so you can
really see what's on here okay I'm going
to try and peel this off from the bottom
oh my god okay so some of it is still
not dry than the yellow one I feel like
that's because I applied it quite heavy
oh that okay that is so painful ow ow ow
oh do you see my skin right now it's
like full-on coming off of my face I'm
going to try and peel off a different
bit cos this little feller is just too
much right now
it's always the bottom of the face that
I had so much Oh
food is hurt this part doesn't actually
hurt that much which is good oh okay I
like it a lot yeah so right now this is
really high honestly I would not forget
to do this to anyone I honestly don't
think I can go on this is just so
painful like do you see the status of
actual real tear a genuine here I
suppose that goes so bad oh oh I feel
like a car over my eyes right now oh my
god can can you guys see this I
literally have a purple nose I heard
this did not stay in my skin okay so now
that I look like a crying mess and is
total idiot
I think I'm going to try and remove this
off with some water can honestly it's
just way too painful and as much as I
want to be the author you guys I just
don't think I can 3le later hey guys I
am now back the mask has been taken off
successfully without pain but there is
this one thing do you notice anything
about my face right now
it has frickin stained my skin I'm sorry
but this is not how it was supposed to
go at all you see this purple line go
all down my nose
I literally have tried everything to try
and get rid of it I used three different
face washes hot water hot flannels a
scrub and it still hasn't come off Oh
what the heck the paint are you this is
the one I used right
I did not stay with skin so um this
is because I use and it asked me a
different brand to these ones and
there's also not washable
why don't you this I should have checked
the bottle I just assumed that was the
paint I owned were like non-toxic
because when I buy paint I usually buy
non-toxic paste for this one this one is
definitely an art paper joke's on me I
honestly have no idea how long this will
last on my face I'm going to try and
remove it with everything I've got
with all my might I'm going to try and
remove it I'll keep you guys updated on
how quickly this will remove off of my
face cuz I mean I don't think purple is
my color so basically what you should
take from this video and do not try this
at home because although I'm a critical
although the favorite is fun to recreate
it it's not worth it for them the Omega
5 wordless cine and I actually check the
bottle of the paint like this one this
is called paint and it's non-toxic and
it's washable and all that stuff it
would have been completely fine just the
rest of my skin is it totally fine it's
not seen at all but this one trip is
just all my scholars of carfully
registered only I would do this I'm just
so clumsy and silly so those are for the
video I'm going to get pulse on
foundation because I feel like you guys
can't take me seriously right cuz I know
for this video I already have you guys
enjoyed it even though it kind of turns
out to be a fail I still don't like it
what a little bit if you guys take aways
just one thing from this video please
let it be the fact that you should
always read the labels
everything you ever
as always reported edition if I did that
I would lovely start with the powerful
news right now
overall I listed at this half block
although there are a few side effects I
mean the pain is just unbearable it
please guys if you have sensitive skin
do not do this I just don't do this I do
this and I work for the pain for you
guys see you guys wouldn't have to do
this at home and go through this in
yourself I really I just quickly want to
mention thank you all so so much for the
lovely response on my latest video which
