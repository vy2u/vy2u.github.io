channel I hope you guys are well today
I'm going to be filming a really
exciting DIY video and I'm going to be
showing you how to create these rainbow
highlighters this crazy unicorn justic
my life has been all over the internet
recently and it's a funny story because
I try to actually buy the original
product or a testing weird beauty
products video but because it's so
highly demand by everyone and everyone
wants to try it out it's completely sold
out and out strong so I thought it would
be already fun DIY to try to attempt at
home and make one Lisa as always with
these things that work all over the
internet I'm not trying to take credit
for this I did not come up with this
idea of myself but I think it would be a
pretty fun DIY to pray for you guys if
you guys are doing this video official
think about thumbs up and subscribe to
this channel as well as my blog channel
so that you never miss a video from me
and without remedy let's jump right into
the video
the first thing you're going to need are
the colors of the rainbow this is quite
an old palette that I've had for a long
time so please excuse how grubby it is
and then you're also going to be needing
some surgical spirit this is also known
as rubbing alcohol you also want
something to mix your paste with then
you're also going to need a highlighter
you can either use a pressed powder or
loose powder it is a really matter then
of course you're going to need a little
empty container that you can put your
highlighter into I'm just using an empty
pressed powder compact you're also going
to need some containers to place your
mixtures into it's probably best to use
something that is waterproof though
because we are going to be putting a
surgical spirit into it so what you want
to do is crush all of the eyeshadows
into a fine powder and place them into
your containers once you have mixed all
the paste together you want to go ahead
with your highlight and add that to the
mixture you can add as much or as little
as you want
I found that adding more highlighter to
the paste made it that much more radiant
and glowing which is exactly what you
want from this height lighter so don't
be afraid to add a ton of your shimmery
powder once you have done that you want
to add about a teaspoon of your surgical
spirit into the mixture and mix
everything together
start placing each color in order into
your compact so when I start with the
pink and place it on the edge then you
want to go on to your orange yellow
light blue dark blue and
purple once all of the colors are placed
into your compact you can now take a
cotton pad and something flat and round
and start placing this into the compact
to really press that product into the
compact to make it much more flat and
smoother now all there is left to do is
to place your compact into the fridge
for about 24 hours and after 24 hours
your compact should be nice and dry or
the surgical spirit should be pretty
much gone and you are ready to use the
product so I am back in order finished
making it the highlighters I actually
decided to make two just to try out a
different technique I actually added a
little bit more shimmery powder to this
one here so let's see how it works okay
so I've got a little flat brush from
zoeva
and let's just pop it into the
highlighter do you see how pigmented
that is that is amazing I'm so excited
to try out okay so I'm just going to go
ahead and test it out on my cheek oh my
goodness that is a very majestic unicorn
pink going on my face what do you guys
think I mean I kind of like it
it does make my faces look the look at
bruised with the blue but overall the
color pigmentation is really good I
think this would be really cool for like
a fun event or a festival I mean I
wouldn't wear this like out on a regular
day that is literally a rainbow on my
face so this is what it looks like I
mean I really love it it's so fun but it
does make my face look a little bit
strange it definitely is
that you would wear on your everyday
kind of basis you know this is just what
you need in your life if you ever sad or
upset just make one of these and your
life just instantly gets better and
imagine taking a flash photo I might
actually try that oh my goodness look at
that that is an actual rainbow on my
face so I do recommend for you guys to
try it out it's not expensive and it is
really really fun it's not like your
typical makeup so it's kind of breaking
the boundaries which is always good
there yeah done is it if you guys are
going to recreate this then please tag
me on it Twitter which is at Rock
Sawyer's I would love to see your
recreations and if you would like to see
