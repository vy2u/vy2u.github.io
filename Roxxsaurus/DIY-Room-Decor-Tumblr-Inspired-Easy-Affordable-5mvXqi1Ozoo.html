filming at three different DIYs for you
guys so tip the ideas from this video
actually inspired by things I've seen on
the internet like Pinterest or tumblr
I made these cute DIY planters inspired
by the sora girls here on YouTube if you
guys enjoy my DIY videos and would like
to see more in the future then
definitely don't forget to give this
video thumbs up so I know and subscribe
to my channel if you're not already I
also made a vlog channel which I'm so so
excited to start it make sure you head
over there and subscribe it's called
rocks or vlogs and I'm going to be
posting a new video on that once a week
so definitely be sure to subscribe I'll
leave the link to my channel down below
in the description if you guys would
like to follow me on any of my social
media my Twitter Instagram and snapchat
are all rocks or a same way it's about
here oh and by the way if you're
wondering what lipstick I'm wearing I'm
wearing stoned by Mac but without my
boot let's just jump right into the
video so for this first DIY you're going
to need some paper cups a container you
don't mind throwing away and fine cement
so the first thing you want to do is
take your container and just cut off the
top it's good to use a juice carton
because the cement won't leak through so
then I'm popping in three cups of the
cement and 1 cup of water this is the
mixture that worked for me but you can
figure out your own mixture by adding
little amounts of each ingredient to
create a peanut butter consistency then
you want to mix up the whole thing
together then you want to take another
paper cup and just shove it into the
cement and this is where your planter is
going to go afterwards it was quite
difficult to push the cup in so you have
to really wiggle it in after about 24
hours the cement should be dry then what
you want to do is just fill out the cup
and rip off the card from around your
planter
so next to create a really cool design
what you want to do is take some masking
tape so as you can see we're going to be
covering the bottom section so I'm
covering the rest of the plant so that I
don't want covered with spray paint at
all and then I'm reaching for a copper
quick dry spray paint and I'm just
spraying that over the exposed section
of our planter leave this to dry for a
few minutes and then you can peel off
the masking tape and you are left with a
really neat and clean design now all is
left to do is to add in your plan I want
with two cacti and if you want to see
how I created those planters I will
leave a link down below for my previous
room decor DIY so I'm just picking up
the cacti from their planters be careful
not to sing yourself and then I'm just
adding some extra soil because the
planter was quite a lot bigger than the
previous one and that is it I really
love these they are so so easy to make
and they really add that rustic and
industrial atmosphere to your room
for this next DIY we're going to be
creating some marble coasters so what
you're going to need is an empty
container some acrylic paint some
coasters of choice and lastly a sealant
to seal your coasters so firstly I'm
just squirting loads and loads of white
paint into the container and then only a
few drops of black with a paintbrush I'm
just mixing everything together but I
don't want to mix the color completely I
really wanted to leave that streaky
effect within the paint this is what's
going to create the marble effect
I'm not taking some white foam you can
use a piece of cardboard or paper and
I'm literally just scraping off the pane
and because it is quite thick it's
really really easy to scrape off onto
the paper now what you want to do is
basically pour that really thick paint
onto your coaster and is going to take
quite a long time for the paint to fully
drip off because it is quite a thick
consistency so you have to take your
time with this so that the design does
not basically come apart you want to
pour the paint onto the coaster in a
very slow and gradual movement if
there's any bits that have not been
covered by this paint you can go back in
with the paintbrush and fix it now
taking my Mod Podge I'm just going to
coat a layer of this onto mycosis to
seal the paint in this is what they look
like once they're dry I think they're
really really unique I actually
discovered this technique when I was at
school and I really love it because it's
not something you can replicate by just
painting on the design the next DIY is
creating your own fruit bowls so what
you want to do is take some air dry clay
roll it into a ball and then start
rolling it flat with a rolling pin once
you've rolled it out to an even
thickness I would probably say about 2
or 3 centimetres thick you can take a
bowl I'm actually using a candle and I'm
just placing the air dry clay over the
bowl and this is going to create that
bowl like shape and then I'm just taking
some scissors and cutting off the excess
clay to achieve a really clean cut edge
once the balls are dry you can go ahead
and start painting them so for the first
one I'm just taking some orange acrylic
paint and I'm painting an orange design
so if you need to you can take a picture
of an orange as reference once you've
painted each section of the orange you
can go in and mix a yellow and white
paint to achieve a really really light
yellow color and this is going to be the
lines within the orange and you can also
paint on some seeds with this I'm then
going back to the orange and just
painting around the outside of the bowl
and I also decided to paint a line one
two you can seal these with Mod Podge or
any other sealant that will make it food
and water resistant but because I'm not
going to be eating off of these I just
use Mod Podge so that is all for my DIY
video I hope you guys enjoyed these and
I hope you recreate though because they
were super super fun to make
