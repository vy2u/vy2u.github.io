Pinterest inspired room decor DIY that's
a mouthful I know you guys like these
kind of videos so I thought I would film
a lot of one then this time I've got
five different DIYs for your room
I think eyes like this kind of video
then definitely give it a thumbs up and
share it with your friends and if you're
not subscribed already then definitely
hit that button down below as well as on
the screen here so without further ado
let's just jump right into the video so
for this first one we're going to be
creating the famous galaxy bottles so
what you're going to need is some
bottles some food coloring water and
something to mix with so I'm just
pouring a little bit of water into the
bottle I'm not really doing this by any
measurements and I'm just taking some
food coloring and also just dropping a
few drops of that into the mixture next
you're gonna need some cotton balls I
actually found that using three combos
at a time is probably the best and you
basically just want to take the cotton
balls and fill up the water with this
next you're going to take some glitter
of choice I'm using silver and I'm just
popping that into the bottle and then
using my brush to kind of mix the whole
mixture together so once one layer is
done you want to move on to the next
color so I'm just shoving some more
cotton balls in and then adding some
water you want to add the water just so
that it barely covers the top of the
cotton balls then I'm going back in with
some red food coloring and I'm just
popping a few drops of that into the
mixture and then just kind of slightly
really gently mixing that together then
I'm adding some glitter once again and
just again really gently mixing that in
to kind of distribute the glitter into
the mixture and basically this is all
you do for the whole process you just
basically add some cotton balls add
water add food coloring and glitter and
mix it all together and I love the
gradient of the different colors all
mixed together I think that the purples
and reds and blues worked really well
for this but of course you can use any
color mixtures that you like you can
actually put these mixtures into any
sized bottles you can even make it into
pendants if you like I really love this
DIY I think it's one of my favorites I
just think it's really cool and awesome
this next one is just some really simple
wall art and what you're going to need
are some CDs some black acrylic paint a
pencil and something sharp what you want
to do is you want to take a paintbrush
and just cover your whole CD with black
paint you can use a few layers to make
it as opaque as you want next you want
to sketch out your mandala
kind of design and I actually went for
something quite simple so it's easy to
scratch out so you want to take your
sharp object and you just want to
basically scratch the design into the CD
and it's just going to remove the paint
that you placed and it's just going to
reveal this really cool design that you
drew out I think this is such a court
DIY it's so simple but it really added
that tumbler esque theme to your room
for this next one you just want a plain
candle and you want to boil it so it
melts be careful when you're doing this
of course if you're underage then
definitely asking the doctor help you
next you just want to take a teacup and
basically pour the candle into a teacup
to keep the wick inside you want to take
two toothpicks and just kind of balance
it on top of the teacup so that as the
wax dries it kind of sets in place and
just like that you've got a really
interesting candle that you made out of
a one-pound candle I think this says
such a kind of Alice and wonderland vibe
to it and I love it this next one is a
plant pot revamp and basically if you
have any cacti or succulents or just any
plants in general you can actually
basically revamp your plant pot so what
I'm doing here is I'm just covering it
with some white acrylic paint and then
for this last one I'm just taking a
sharpie and just putting some dots all
over it this design is so simple but I
think it really goes with my room and
it's super cute and for the second one I
went with something more intricate and
basically what I'm doing is I'm just
cutting out strips of masking tape and
then placing that over the plant part in
a cool design doing this it's just
basically going to preserve that bottom
color of white underneath the masking
tape I'm then reaching for some blue
acrylic paint and I'm just mixing that
in with the whites and with this I'm
just basically painting the whole plant
part and over the masking tape that we
placed once you peel the masking tape
off you're just going to reveal this
really cool pattern I think that this
design
looks like it took a lot of time but it
actually literally took you about ten
minutes for this next one you just go to
need an artist canvas and a whole load
of lipsticks so basically I'm just
covering my lips with this lipstick and
I'm just kissing the canvas I really
love this simple DIY I feel like it's
really appropriate for Valentine's Day
coming up so that has all for my DIY I
