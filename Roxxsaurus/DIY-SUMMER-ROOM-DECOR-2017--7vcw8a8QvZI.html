it going
in today's video I'm going to be showing
you guys how to achieve it some really
cute DIYs for your room inspired by some
I made some really adorable things and
such as this little cactus pillow and
also this a banana leaf pillow I am
actually obsessed and surprisingly I
feel like these things were quite easy
to make so I really hope you guys enjoy
this video and retreat some of these
before we go straight into this video I
just want to let you guys know that I am
having a back-to-school giveaway at the
moment so I'll link that video down
below so you guys can check it out and
enter I am giving away a bunch of
stationary and like school supplies but
also an iPad I am so excited for one of
you to win this if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure you smash that you
thumbs up just down below and also
subscribe if you haven't already because
I would love to have you here come and
join the dinosaur family but without
some around the mean let's get on into
the video okay so for this first DIY
we're going to be making this banana
leaf pillow now this looks something
like you could buy in Urban Outfitters
or any store like that I absolutely love
it so let's get on into the tutorial so
for this you're gonna need just a plain
pillowcase I brought this canvas one
from hobby craft and then you're going
to need a bunch of acrylic paint and
some brushes so what you want to do is
get some kind of design online I just
looked at another banana leaf color that
I saw online and I just pretty much went
along and traced the kind of like design
of it and I just really played it by ear
I kind of did my own thing and just went
really creative with it you don't have
to be super artistic to be able to
achieve this because as you can see it
does look really simple it's just a
plain leaf so I'm basically just doing
that over and over again I'm using a
different combinations of paints I'm
using some dark green paints as well as
some lighter ones just to give it some
dimension to the leaf and then loads
I've got my whole design I'm going in
with some black paint and just kind of
painting this around the
tips of the leaf together even more
dimension and that is pretty much it now
you could use some actual fabric pain to
do this if you wanted the pillow to
actually be able to be washed and stuff
but I just use acrylic paint and I feel
like it works just as well
the next DIY is this little cactus made
out of pebbles and now I saw this on
Pinterest and I just thought it was so
cute and it's so easy to do and you can
totally rock this on like your shells or
your bedside table so what you're going
to need for this is a few large pebbles
that you're just going to take and paint
green and then you're going to take some
white paint on a tiny brush and just do
it lines and dots and whatever you kind
of feel like doing just to kind of make
it look a little bit more like a cactus
I make sure to get different kind of
rocks so I got like slightly larger ones
and then slightly thinner ones just to
make the cactus look a little bit more
realistic and I also made some different
colors to really give it the kind of
like fake plant dimension and make it
look even more realistic once you're
done with the pebbles you can move on to
your plant part you can of course buy a
ready-made plant pot but I thought
what's the fun in that so I just decided
to paint mine
bright yellow and basically just stick
the stones in also to actually fill in
the actual plant part I use some cotton
balls that you can just shove inside and
then put the pebbles on top and that is
the finish do I have easy
now this next DIY is on how to create
this really cute cactus pillow if you
guys can tell I'm obsessed with cactuses
at the moment or cacti should I say so
what you're going to need for this is
some green fabric of course and then
some hot glue and also some stuffing you
could use cotton balls for this but I
decided to actually use this soft toy
filling so the first thing you want to
do is of course draw out the outline of
your actual cactus on the left side of
the fabric and you want to make sure
that your fabric is doubled so that it
creates two layers for the back and the
front you then want to glue the actual
cactus together while sits on the back
side I don't know if I'm displaying this
right but I'm sure you guys can see what
I'm doing here once everything is glued
down you want to just slip the whole
fabric inside out so that it reveals the
right-hand side of the actual cactus and
then you just want to start filling this
in with the toys filling or some cotton
balls whatever you would like to fill
your cactus with and then you just want
to seal it shut with your hot glue to
add a little bit of detail to your
cactus you can actually take some white
felt fabric and cut this into like
little rectangles as you can see I'm
doing here and then what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to stick this in
random places on the cactus this is
going to make it look that little bit
more realistic and just add a little bit
of detail on there because if you look
at any illustrations of cacti
usually see that they have like these
white kind of lines all over them I'm
not really too sure what that's meant to
be but it looks cool so I thought I
would do the same and that is the
finished cactus I absolutely love I
think is so cute it just adds like a
really nice charming effect to your bed
and it just looks so cute and this last
DIY is absolutely adorable
I also saw this on Pinterest and I fell
in love so to make these donut coasters
what you're going to need is obviously
two cool coasters you then want to kind
of like drill a hole through it
I actually got Matt to do this for me
because I couldn't do it but I then take
some paint so you can just mix red and
white to make this really cool like pink
color and I really messily just kind of
painted that on top of the coaster to
make it look like the pink icing
doughnuts to make it dry quicker you can
also use a hairdryer in between it's so
handy I'm then taking a slightly darker
pink and I'm just going around the edges
of the icing to add a little bit of
dimension there and just make it look a
little bit more 3d you can also then use
water to just blend the colors in a
little bit more evenly if you're
struggling with it I'm then taking some
lighter pink and I'm doing the highlight
of the icing to make it look even more
dimensional and just bring the doughnut
to life once that's done I'm going to
take some white acrylic paint on a
little brush and I'm just doing like all
of the sprinkles on the doughnut in
different colors like yellow white and
blue I think this looks so Q and then
I'm just going to seal the whole thing
with some Mod Podge to make it
waterproof and that is the finished
design I absolutely love these I think
they look so cute and they really just
add a lot of color to your table or your
dining area and these were so cheap and
easy to create those all of my summer
room decor DIY girl shy of a mouthful I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
