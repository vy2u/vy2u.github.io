hope you guys are doing really well
today I'm going to be showing you guys
how to achieve contouring and
highlighting without any makeup
whatsoever I know it sounds insane the
reason why I say that this DIY /
technique is semi-permanent is because
that this will fade over time which is
why you kind of have to repeat this DIY
for it to actually work and to maintain
it this original idea came from this
Instagram here I'm pretty sure she's
also a youtuber so I'll leave all her
details down below because I really love
the idea of making like highlighting and
contouring a little bit more permanent
rather than just makeup I thought I
would take this idea and kind of tweak
the recipe a little bit and see what
happens
the I enjoy this video please be sure to
smash their huge thumbs up and just down
below and subscribe if you haven't
already because I would love to have you
here I post two times a week and I also
have a vlog channel for those of you who
would like to catch up on my daily life
I'll pop it just there in the corner so
you guys can check that out but without
further ado let's jump right into the
video the first thing you want to do is
just cleanse your face that it's nice
and clean and free of makeup as you can
see it I'm wearing eye makeup and I've
got my eyebrows on but my skin is
completely bare first thing you want is
two separate containers so I've got two
little dishes here where I can kind of
mix my two DIYs into so for the first
mixture what you want is a natural
yoghurt this one is from Tesco you guys
can let you use any brand that you like
this naturally reduces fine lines and
wrinkles and the lactic acid will help
dissolve dead skin and tighten your
pores I'm going to take some honey now
this is again antibacterial it's going
for anti-aging and it's extremely
moisturizing and soothing to help create
that glow to the skin and the last
ingredient is coconut oil and add this
into the mixture I've got this one
that's a spray lit but you can use
whatever coconut form you want our
coconut oil is of course beneficial for
your hair your skin because it's
antibacterial and it's also moisturizing
so what you want to do is just mix all
of that together and leave that on the
side whilst you create the contour DIY
this we're gonna need is some coffee you
want it to be like a fine kind of powder
Coffee is great for the skin as it
tightens exfoliates
constrict the blood vessel under the
skin and it helps reduce swelling and
puffiness the next ingredient is cocoa
powder this is packed with antioxidants
and it helps repair the skin cells best
add a bit of body you just want to add a
tiny bit of honey as well and this is
again antibacterial and great for the
skin though the last ingredient is kind
of where I'd tweak the original recipe
and I actually add a tiny bit of fake
tan make sure that this is fake tan for
your face there's one that you have used
before and you haven't had any problems
with it then you just want to mix all
that together and that is the DIY mask
finished okay so now I've made my DIY
contour in highlight I'm going to take
my highlight shade first and I'm going
to apply this with a foundation brush so
with this I'm just going to apply this
to the natural areas of my face where I
would usually kind of apply highlight
/nu brightening products so underneath
my eye make sure you don't get too close
to your eye of course and kind of like
extending it out into my hairline I'm
also gonna apply some to my forehead I'm
going to apply some down the bridge of
my nose as well
now that I've done that my highlight
mask I'm going to go in with the contour
mask and just apply this as I usually
would with my contour products so with
this I'm just going to apply some to the
hollow in my cheek first
okay so this is what the finished
facemask looks like on because we have
her fake tan in it I would recommend to
kind of blend out any harsh edges so
that that doesn't stay on your face in
like a harsh kind of line if you know
what I mean so I'm just going to leave
this on my face for about ten minutes
and then I'm going to wash it off and be
right back so this is the final result I
feel like my skin is so so radiant can
you guys see that glow to my face like
it's incredible and it's so so nice to
the touch as well it's just it feels
really plump and just really moisturized
I also really love that a very subtle
definition around the circumference of
my face as well as my cheekbones and my
nose it really adds to like that natural
look without actually having to apply
any contour to your face in the form of
makeup then it's all down to the coffee
and definitely a lot to the fake tan so
that is why I think it definitely worked
I'm not saying that this is definitely a
replacement for makeup because makeup is
so much more powerful but I definitely
stand by the fact that it's always good
to start with a good base and if your
skin is really nicely moisturized and
your makeup application is definitely
going to go on so much smoother so take
this as like a starting point if you
will and it's amazing for the days that
you don't want to wear makeup but you
kind of want to look like you are that's
all for this video I really hope you
guys enjoyed err and found it helpful if
you did please watch that huge thumbs up
just down below I am now gonna go off
and wash my hair because I got so much
coffee and yogurt in my hair make sure
you guys don't forget to subscribe it
would really mean a lot to me and I hope
you guys having a wonderful day and I'll
see you very soon in my next one
bye - in it oh well
