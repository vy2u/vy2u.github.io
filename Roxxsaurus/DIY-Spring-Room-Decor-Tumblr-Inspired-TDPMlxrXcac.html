filming a very exciting video for you
guys today is actually the first day of
spring which I'm so excited about
because spring is one of my favorite
seasons and everything is just coming
back to life everything is so colorful
so I thought it's only appropriate for
me to film a spring inspired DIY for you
guys so in this video I'm going to be
showing you four different tutorials on
how to achieve different room
decorations for your room for spring and
I hope you guys enjoy them if you do
then definitely don't forget to give me
a thumbs up and subscribe if you're not
already and if you want to follow me on
any of my social media on my Instagram
Twitter and snapchat are all rocks for a
scene where it's felt here so what I'll
cover do let's just go right into the
video so the first that DIY is super
simple is just a frame with a floral
piece in the middle so what you want to
do is take a wooden frame and just paint
it all white or any color that you want
that will fit your room color scheme so
I'm using a simple white paint that's
actually meant for walls but if you have
any acrylic paint I think that would
probably work a little bit better then
I'm taking some fake flowers these I got
from the range and then I'm cutting off
the fake stem just to set up the flowers
fit a little bit better into the frame
then I'm just carefully laying them out
into the frame how I like and placing
the glass over top and just constructing
the whole frame together again I think
this is such a simple one but it looks
really cute and it's perfect for spring
the next DIY are these cute planters
made out of white paper bags so all you
need for this is some plain white paper
bags and some chalkboard labels which
are actually meant for jars I got both
of these from the range for those of you
who are wondering so what you want to do
is take your labels and just place them
wherever you want onto the paper bag I
think this is a really nice way to
decorate a simple plain bag because you
can write any cute message on to the
chalkboard label I went for something
appropriate for today which is the first
day of spring so I just wrote hello
spring and I popped in some fake flowers
to decorate the bag you can use even
real or fake flowers I decided to go
with fake just because they're gonna
last that little bit longer
the next DIY is decorating your own roof
so I've taken this roof which I already
had and it's a heart shape and then I've
taken some pink ribbon and I've wrapped
it all the way
on the circumference of the reef next I
took this string of flowers which I got
from the range and then I again just
wrap this around and adjust the flowers
accordingly and I think that this is
such a cute way to take a simple reef
and make it into a really cute spring
themed reef for your room our DIY is a
skull candle holder I've never seen
anyone do a tutorial on something like
this before you might need a little bit
more skill for this but I think it's
easy anyway so all you need for this is
some air dry clay preferably in a light
shade and also a round candle of any
color you also want a skull as a
reference you can either use a picture
or an actual 3d skull if you have one so
I'm taking my clay and just kind of
molding it into a ball I found this
quite difficult as the clay was quite
stiff so I actually ended up just
bashing it on a flat surface and this
helped to put the clay into the shape
that I wanted so then you want to split
the ball into two sections actually made
it up making them a little bit thicker
so here I'm just taking off the excess
clay to try and make it a little bit
thinner then I'm just kind of molding it
into a half sphere and I'm taking the
first section and just poking in holes
to create the eyes of the skull and I'm
also just wiggling my little tool about
to make them a little bit bigger and
then kind of molding the front part of
the skull and creating the cheekbones
just by pressing my thumbs in next I'm
creating the nose and again going back
into the shape of the skull to really
mold it into the shape that I want it to
be but this took quite a long time but
of course I shortened it so you guys
wouldn't get too bored of it but
basically you just want to keep going
back and forth and creating the desired
shape of your skull once I was done I
attached the two halves of the skull
together and I used some water to act as
a glue to kind of make the hole sticking
process much much easier the candle
portion is really simple you want to
take a sharp object and just carve this
brain like pattern into the candle next
you want to paint your skull any car you
like I just ended up painting it white
with the same paint that are used
earlier so once your skull is completely
dry and stiff you can go ahead and plate
your brain candle into the skull and you
are done
I think this is such a cute DIY it's
kind of creepy kind of tumblr resk but
nonetheless I really really like it and
it's just a really cool piece for your
room displays
so that is all for my spring DIYs for
your room as always don't forget to give

twice a week I actually do have a
schedule I don't know if you guys have
noticed but I upload on Wednesdays and
Sundays at 6 p.m. UK time so if you guys
didn't notice that that is my schedule
and I try to stick to it sometimes I
post maybe half an hour later depending
on how long the upload time is but I try
to stick to 6 p.m. most of the time so
yeah that was good for me I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and I'll
see you both in in my next video on
Wednesday next I shadow don't is
actually applying a regular eye shadow
that you want to go with for that day
directly onto the primer and this is
because sometimes when you apply a dark
shade of eyeshadow directly onto the
primer when you brush first comes in
contact with your skin it can actually
leave a massive block of powder in that
place right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
