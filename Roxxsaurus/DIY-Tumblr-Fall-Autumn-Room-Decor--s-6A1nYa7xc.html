hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys all well so
today I have some awesome / full
inspired DIY room decor for you guys
this is very much inspired by Pinterest
and Tumblr so there's definitely going
to be something in there that you guys
will like I personally love all of these
DIYs so so much and I think they're so
easy and also cheap to make which is
always good so if you guys enjoyed this
video please make sure to it smash that
huge thumbs up just down below and
subscribe if you're brand new I also
have a vlog channel which I'll leave in
the little eye in the corner so you guys
can check that out I've actually just
posted a Halloween vlog from my
Halloween party and it's slow so funny I
was like sheep peeing myself when I was
like editing it so I hope you guys like
it and make sure you check out my blog
channel but if you guys are going to see
how to create some awesome awesome DIYs
then let's get to it so for the first
DIY all you need is two empty jars and
some kind of fabric material if it's
knitted it's gonna look even look cozy
so I'm actually taking an old pair of
leggings and I'm cutting off of one of
the legs and just putting this over at
my jaw I'm then folding over the
material to make it look a little bit
more cozy and like a sock and I'm
trimming off the excess material I'm
then taking some white string and
wrapping this around a few times and
tying this off into a bow next I'm just
going to decorate this with a fake leaf
and also some fake red berries and I'm
just taking both of those behind the
string I'm then just popping in a tea
light candle and that is the DIY
finished I have made one of these last
year and they are totally safe because
the fabric isn't on the inside is on the
outside but better to be safe than sorry
if you are going to recreate these make
sure you are around to keep an eye out
on them just in case
but that's next hour why you're gonna
need to get a template off of Google
I've chosen to go with a stag head
because they are quite on trend and very
autumnal and then taking my laptop
screen and enlarging the picture and
just tracing off the outline this is a
great hack to do if you don't have a
printer but you desperately need an
outline of something I'm there just
cutting off the edges and this is my
outline complete now I'm just reaching
for some último fabric I went for this
red tartan material and I'm just
basically tracing the outline of the
stag onto the material and then cutting
this out I'm then taking a plane pillow
of choice and I'm just going to glue the
stag on with some fabric glue and that
is the pillow complete
for this next DIY you're gonna need some
pinecones some gray felt fabric and some
gems or beads of choice the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to cut out
a triangle out of the felt fabric and
I'm going to fold this into a round cone
shape using some fabric glue and then
cutting out two rounded pieces of fabric
and these are going to be the ears so
I'm just folding them and popping some
glue inside to maintain that
3-dimensional shape I'm also cutting two
long pieces and these are going to be
the little arms of the Hedgehog once the
body of your hedgehogs are complete what
you want to do is just take your black
beads or gems and those are going to be
the eyes of the Hedgehog as well the
next DIY is going to be a stag wall art
so I'm first just tracing out the
outline of my stag you can again use an
outline if you're not good at freehand
drawing and then taking some gold
metallic sheet and I'm just basically
going to trace out the head of the stag
and then we're actually just going to be
gluing this over the canvas I then use
my scissors to just scratch some cool
patterns into the metallic material I
thought this looked quite cool and then
just taking some pine cones and crushing
up the petals and I'm just going to
stick those on on top of the antlers and
this is going to give it a really nice
three-dimensional effect
and for the last yearwe what you need is
a long branch and a bunch of leaves and
also this like thin fishing rod string I
don't really know what the actual term
of it is basically you just want to tie
this around the branch and glue a bunch
of leaves onto that and this is how it
looks finished I think it looks amazing
so that is all for my DIY autumn slash
full deck or for your room video such a
mouthful I hope you guys enjoyed these
and if you did please be sure to give it
