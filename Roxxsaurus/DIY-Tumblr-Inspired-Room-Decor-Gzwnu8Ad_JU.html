this Tumblr and Pinterest inspired room
decor that's all DIY so hope you guys
enjoyed this DIY video if you recreate
any of these then definitely tag me on
Instagram or Twitter and I'll definitely
like it and don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up and subscribe I'd love
to have you here thank you guys so much
for 600,000 subscribers this is
literally insane I love you all so so
much then with that probably let's just
jump straight into the video so the
first DIY we're going to be creating are
some ring dishes and this is such a cute
and handy DIY if you're one of these
people that just loses rings everywhere
around the house this is like the best
DIY for you so what you need for this is
some oven-baked clay and it has to be
oven bakes that you can actually put it
in the oven for it to harden so what I'm
doing is I'm just taking a color palette
of choice you can literally mix any
colors but I do recommend having a lot
of white so that the dish comes out
quite bright and then what you want to
do is just roll them into strips and
basically wrap them around each other
into a twist
once you have twisted all the strands
enough you can just bend it on itself
and twist it further to efficiently mix
the colors all together after that you
can literally go to town and just mush
it into a big ball and this will just
create really interesting effects and
really cool patterns once you're happy
with your pattern you can just start
rolling it flat on a surface and you
don't want it to be too thick you want
it to be about six millimeters thick so
that it actually bakes when you put it
in the oven sometimes the best pattern
is right on the edges which means you
will have to cut it off so I'm just kind
of bending it inwards to make sure that
the really cool pattern stays in the
middle and I don't have to get rid of it
in the end once you're happy with the
overall pattern that you can peel it off
the surface and place it in a shallow
dish if you don't have anything like
that you can always take a lid of a pot
or anything like that that you have
laying around in your kitchen and then
you just want to cut off the edges with
a knife or scissors I'm just using
scissors because I was too lazy to get a
knife oh look at my cat he's trying to
do some DIY with me pets in humans that
DIY together stay together once it's all
done you can put it in your oven and you
have to carefully read the back of the
packet of the baking clay and literally
put it in at the heat that it says and
for as long as it says in my experience
when I put it as long as it's said to
put it in the oven for it actually was
too hot and it burnt it as you can see
keep on checking up on it in the oven
just to make sure that it doesn't burn
and to finish off the whole thing I'm
just taking some gold acrylic paint and
I'm just covering the edges of this all
around just to give it a nice finish and
I'm also taking that gold into the
actual dish itself just to kind of tie
in with the skirting of the dish as well
to finish it off you can also of course
put some clear varnish over the top to
give it that glassy look however I
didn't have any so I skip this step and
this is the final leg I created
different colors and they just turned
out amazing
this next one is probably the cheapest
DIY in this video but it's so cute all
you need is some branches a clear bottle
and some gold spray paint so what you
want to do is lay down your branches on
a surface that you don't mind getting
gold make sure your room is
well-ventilated because this stuff
really stinks I'm just spraying both of
the sides of the branches gold and
waiting for it to dry this actually
didn't take too long as this spray was
fast drying
next we're going to focus on the bottle
part and you just want to take any clear
bottle that you have laying around and
you just want to wrap some masking tape
around it like so and when you spray the
bottle it will just prevent it from
going underneath the masking tape which
will create that really cool clear and
gold stripe effect
so when you take the masking tape off
you get a clear edge sometimes the spray
does go underneath as you can see it
happened to me but don't worry you can
just scrape it off with some scissors
and you're good to go so the last part
is of course putting new branches into
the gold bars and I think this is such a
simple yet really cute and you can of
course do this with any colors you want
but I thought that God is quite on-trend
and it would look cool in my room and
the last DIY is some brushes holders
this is my favorite favorite DIY I'm so
glad I made this because it looks
amazing on my vanity area all you need
for this is some really cheap glasses
I've got these for like one pound fifty
from Tesco's and then again you're going
to need some masking tape and you just
want to wrap that around about halfway
through and I'm just using acrylic paint
of course acrylic paint is quite thin so
you need a few coats and I just dried my
glass between the coats so that you
could get a nice opaque effect and when
you're doing this you want to do it in
downward strokes
I feel like this works the best rather
than going around it just looks much
neater and then when you peel off the
masking tape you get a clean edge and it
just looks amazing when you put your
brushes in this is such a cool DIY they
literally look like you bought them from
a store but you made them for so so
cheap so that is all for this video if
