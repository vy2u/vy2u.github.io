full and awesome DIY room decor and I'm
gonna be sharing with you three
different tutorials that I found on
Pinterest or just floating around the
internet and I'm going to be recreating
them for you in this video just so you
can spruce up your room a little bit and
make you feel more Tom noir and cozy so
without further ado let's just jump
reddit so for this first one I'm
creating some skeleton leaves as they're
called and then I've just framed them in
a white frame so what you're gonna need
for this is some waxy and shiny leaves
it works best on those and you're also
gonna need some washing soda
I bought this soda crystals from Tesco's
so to create the mixture you're gonna
need 6 cups of water and then one cup of
soda crystals and you're gonna put that
in your little pots with your leaves and
heat that to a boil after it has boiled
you can just literally leave them in the
mixture for at least one hour you're
gonna notice that the leaves are
starting to really bleed the color and
they're gonna get much darker than they
were originally and that's a good sign
you can also flip them over to make sure
they're evenly covered so after they've
boiled for about an hour you can now
take your pot into the sink and then use
a colander to just sift through the
leaves and wash them
next up taking a small that less steeper
pot and I'm just placing the leaves in
there and then I'm pouring in some water
just so it barely covers the leaves
after that I'm taking some bleach and
I'm using half a cup of household bleach
and if you are underage and please do
not do this by yourself get a guardian
to help you because bleach can be very
dangerous and should not be in reach of
children and then I'm placing that half
a cup of bleach in that water with the
leaves and what this is gonna do is
really get rid of the pigment and bleach
the color to the lightest shade possible
so after about half an hour the loose
started to get really pale and really
white and after that I took them out and
place them flat on my hand and rinse
them under the tap with cold water now
for the last step I'm using some drawing
ink just slip dip with the leaves in and
give them a little bit of a stain you
can also use food coloring for this and
there you go these are the skeleton
see-through leaves I think they're so
cute especially when you frame them and
I think it's a really good transitioning
piece from autumn into winter because
they look really frosty and I just
really love the look of them so I hope
you guys enjoy it too and try to
recreate it this next one is so simple
all you have to do is collect some
pinecones from your local forest or Park
and then you're gonna paint the edges of
each of the Petzl with a desired color I
went for gold because I really like the
color and it's quite autumn Noir and
Christmasy at the same time I have to
say I literally had a heart attack when
I brought this home because I was so
ready to film this video for you guys
and I noticed that there was bugs
crawling out of these pinecones and I am
so petrified of insects and bugs and
stuff like that and I literally wouldn't
go near them and I feel like as I'm
filming this tutorial there's still some
bugs inside and that just makes me so
uneasy that's why I'm hardly holding in
the pine cone as you can see because I
am literally afraid that a bug will
touch my hand so anyway for this I'm
just using an acrylic paint in a gold
shade and I'm
painting each of the ends of the petals
for a nice pop of color to the pine cart
they almost look like they were bought
from a store or something and it really
just spices them up a lot and this last
tour is basically creating a candy corn
sort of pattern on a bottle using a
gradient for this all you're gonna need
is two bottles you guys probably
recognize these two from one of my
previous DIY tutorials you're also gonna
need a bit of cardboard or whatever you
have laying around just so you can place
your paints on it and the last thing
you'll need is a sponge just to use as a
distributor of the paint so first of all
I'm picking up some yellow paint and I'm
placing that at the bottom just like it
is on a candy corn sweet I'm just
imitating the same pattern and design of
that I'm dabbing that color on as
opposed to swiping because we want to
get a really soft effect and then I'm
mixing a red and a yellow to make this
orange shade and I'm dabbing that on in
the center of my bottle so you blend the
colors together I'm using the clean side
of my sponge and I'm just dabbing that
up and down between the two shades to
create a really nice soft transition
color and then all there is left to do
is create the white at the top and blend
that in nicely with the orange and then
as the finished look I really love these
they look so cute and especially if you
have some candy corn sweets they will
look amazing next to the bottles for
this video I hope you guys enjoy that
and if you did then definitely give it a
thumbs up because it really helps me out
a lot and subscribe if you haven't
