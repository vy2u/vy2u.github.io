hope you guys have an awesome day so far
so today as you can see I'm doing an
extra load because I don't usually post
today but I thought I would upload an
excellent video to you guys and I'm
really excited for this one because well
if you've been living under a rock you
wouldn't know that Starbucks has just
released a unicorn Frappuccino like a
unicorn Frappuccino I was so excited
when I found it out but unfortunately
they do not make it here in the UK when
I went into my Starbucks and they said
they didn't how there I was devastated
so I thought well you guys this is a
great opportunity to do a DIY so today
as you can tell I'm going to be showing
you guys how to do a DIY unicorn
Frappuccino from Starbucks so these are
the two different variations of the
drink I've come up with I absolutely
love how they turned out they have
actually mixed up a little bit so the
blue isn't as vibrant as it was when I
first made them by still love them
regardless I think they look so cool for
like parties or photos like they're so
Instagram of all give this video a
thumbs up if you love unicorns as much
as I do and if you are subscribed yet in
picture you are because I would like to
have you here come and join the dinosaur
family but that is enough rambling
without further ado let's get into the
video so the ingredients are going to
need are some vanilla ice cream some
milk I'm using oat milk but you can use
whatever you like I'm also using it some
whipped cream and some flavoring this
one is raspberry you then also going to
need some mango sorbet some food
coloring a pink and blue and then to
finish off the drink you're also going
to need some edible glitter / sparkles
lastly to of course make the strength
you're also going to need some Starbucks
cups so the first step is to take 4
tablespoons of vanilla ice cream and pop
that into a glass this is going to be
the base of the milkshake / Frappuccino
and then adding 2 tablespoons of mango
sorbet because the original milkshake
has a mango flavoring inside now to
water down the consistency a little bit
I'm adding a little bit of milk to the
mixture
and then popping in some pink food color
and mixing all of this together you can
add more pink food coloring if you want
the color to be more vibrant so that's
what I'm doing here I'm just going back
and forth to get the desired effect that
I like lastly I'm going to add some ice
into my drink and put that aside
meanwhile I'm going to take my Starbucks
cup and take my blue food color and just
kind of squirt this around on the inside
of the cup this is going to create that
really cool unicorn blue effect that
Starbucks also do in the original
Starbucks drink the blue is actually
sour so if you can find anything that's
blue and sour that can work as well
however I can point anything so I'm just
using some blue food color
once you have decorated your cup with
the blue inside you can pour in the rest
of your Frappuccino into the cup now
lastly to decorate your drink you're
going to add some whipped cream to the
very top of the drink so I'm just
creating this swirly design and once
you're finished you don't want to take
your edible glitter and just Sparkle
that on top of the whipped cream adding
the sparkles to the top really finishes
off the drink and this is what it looks
like
and these are the finished unicorn
frappuccinos I am honestly in love with
how they turned out they look so cute
they're going to be amazing for
Instagram and lastly of course we have
to do the taste test so let's see oh my
god that tastes so good I think it's a
rub resource that I added so my final
verdict is these are absolutely
amazingly taste so so good so if you
guys haven't got the unicorn Frappuccino
in your country as well just make them
yourself because you totally can so good
I'm gonna be sippin on this for the rest
of the video so that is the end of the
video if you guys enjoyed it make sure
you smash that you sums up just down
below and also subscribe if you haven't
already because I would love to have you
here you can come and join the dinosaur
family where we have lots and lots of
fun if you guys decide to recreate these
make sure you tag me on Instagram or
Twitter at Rock Saurus because I would
love to see your recreation
I think I'm mostly in love with like the
glitter the edible glitter at the top is
so cool but that is all from me I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day and
I'll see very soon in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
