back to school makeup as you can see it
from the title and my face and then as
some schools may not allow this amount
of makeup so maybe perhaps this makeup
is more suitable for like high school
and like college sort of students if
this is too much and you are not allowed
to wear this amount of makeup then I
have another tutorial that you can watch
from last year and it's much more
wearable and much more natural-looking
I'll pop that down here so you can click
on it right now anyway without further
ado let's just jump right in so the
first thing I'm doing is taking my
foundation and the choice of today is
the fit me foundation by Maybelline and
this is actually a new addition to my
collection I haven't tried this for that
long but so far I'm really liking it I'm
just taking a foundation brush this
doesn't have a name or anything so just
a random foundation brush will do and I
popped that on the back of my hand and
I'm just applying nine any areas where I
need a little bit more coverage I really
like this foundation because it's quite
lightweight and doesn't feel cakey on
the skin at all but it does give you a
healthy glow and a nice bit of coverage
on the skin
not that I have the desired finish of
them is set everything in place with the
Emmy away powder this is very very
affordable it's about two pounds or
something and it's really good it does
this job so I'm just using a Mac brush
Mac angle brush I don't know which one
this is I'm using this because it's
quite small and it can get in to any
sort of small areas of your face like
underneath the eyes and I really like
using this for setting my foundation
next I'm going to work on my eyebrows
and I'm gonna be using this anyway I got
a kit and this is again very affordable
same brand as the powder it does the job
I always say don't splurge on an eyebrow
powder because at the end of the day
it's just a brown like eyeshadow so
don't spend a lot of money on that when
you're doing this try to go in little
tiny strokes to imitate the motion of
your head this will make your eyebrows
look much more natural rather than drawn
on and this is optional but to set them
I'm going to be using a dis little
eyebrow gel and this is by Rimmel it's
called brow this way I use this purely
because I need to lighten my brows a
little bit too much my hair color I like
to brush up because it's gonna get every
single brow with the gel if you ever get
too much brow gel in your eyebrows just
use a tiny little spoolie to brush that
product out so now for the fun part we
can actually focus on our eyes and I
thought because it you're going back to
school and it's sort of transitioning
into autumn time we might add a little
bit of warmth to the eyes and I'm going
to go into the crease with a nice
tangerine color and for this I'm
actually going to use a Revlon blush so
some of you might think that's weird but
I'll use this in the crease sometimes
it's a nice cream consistency so it's
not harsh on the eyes at all and it
looks like this so I use this all the
time on my eyes and I find that it just
works great as a base for any orangie
sort of pigmented shadows so unless
you're just taking that on a finger and
swiping that in there like so and I'm
just trying to focus that in the outer
bit of my eye but popping that in the
crease
so once that is on I'm just taking a big
fluffy brush like this and I'm just
gonna blend that out next I'm reaching
for my sleek palette and this is in
shade or natural 601 and I'm using the
orange shade from this which is this one
it's very matte and really creamy and I
love it a lot as a transition color so
I'm just going to pop that just above
the orange that we applied earlier now
because this is a really nice and soft
shadow it's gonna act as a great
transition color to the heavily
pigmented orange that we applied first
I'm also gonna take that underneath my
lower lash line as well so I know this
may look super Krewe out at the moment
but don't worry girl we're going to
blend it out next I'm gonna be reaching
for the brown eyeshadow which is this
one here from the same palette and I'm
taking that on a different fluffy brush
and I'm gonna pop that in the crease but
trying to focus it on the outer edge and
what this is gonna do is just depth in
it up a lot more because right now it's
looking kind of flat
because the brown is kind of come off as
really pigmented we're just going to try
and diffuse that with the orange shade
the key for this look is just a blend
blend blend so at the moment I think
that blue ended up pretty nicely so I'm
going to go in with the orange and also
the brown and just combining them
together and I'm dragging that over the
lower lash line just so everything is
nicely tied together now to get a little
bit of highlight I'm going in it with
the matte white shade from this palette
and I'm using my Urban Decay Naked 2
brush for this because I find that it's
quite good for precision and I'm using
the flat brush to apply that just in the
center of my eyelid then I'm using the
other end just to diffuse the white into
the orange you can also go in with the
white into the brow bone as a little bit
of a highlight and then again really
quickly I'm just going to repeat the
center the other eye
so now for eyeliner I'm going to be
using this eyeliner by collection again
really affordable and drugstore and this
is the extreme 24-hour felt tip liner I
really recommend this to you guys
because it's very easy to use because of
the felt tip again you can make the line
as thick or as thin as you like my
personal tip to making a line to look
not rudy dramatic is keeping it on the
outer corner next is of course a mascara
we cannot skip that step mascara using
today is by Bourjois again relatively
cheap and I don't actually don't know if
they sell this anymore
I've got mine from TK Maxx but I haven't
seen this in like superdrug or anything
I really like the brush on this it
really catches every single lash and
it's amazing and of course I'm going to
be seing a blush that's very close to my
heart and this is by Smith
it's called life the peach it's a very
very bored just tangerine color just
makes your face look really healthy and
tan and I just love this blush so much
I'm applying that with a real techniques
blush brush so I'm just applying that to
the apples of my cheek
so if you want this is the look
completely done you can leave it at this
step but of course I like my makeup so
I'm going to go into bronzer highlighter
and also I'm going to add a lip stick
and I'm going to be using my benefit
bronzer to bronze up my face a little
bit and I'm using the same brush
actually that I used to earth or
applying powder just because I can't
above to grab another brush so so I'm
just applying that in the hollows of my
cheek for highlighter I'm going to be
using at this seventeen instant glow
shimmer brick and I love this
highlighter so much it's very affordable
again seventeen is a very affordable
brand in Superdrug I'm just going to
dust all of that remaining product off
and swirl it around in this little
shimmer brick and then just apply it to
the highest point of my cheekbone
let's finish off this look I'm gonna be
going in with a sleek lipstick and this
is called barely-there
it's a very very natural shade of
lipstick it's literally like your lips
that batter so perfect to scoop so this
is the final look I hope you guys like
here as I said it's soft turned out a
little bit more dramatic than I intended
for it to be but I hope you guys liked
it anywhere
