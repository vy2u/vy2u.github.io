and simple back to school makeup for you
I hope you guys enjoyed this and maybe
take some inspiration from it if you
don't go to school then that's ok you
can just use this for work or whatever
other occasion you might stumble across
and I think that it's very natural and
looks really really stunning in photos
so I hope you guys enjoyed and let's
just jump right in so first thing first
I'm going to be using a little bit of
foundation the one I'm going to be using
today is the Bourjois healthy mix this
is a drugstore foundation it's quite
cheap for the amount of that yet and I
think it's really really good so I'm
just going to be applying that in the
areas where I'm just a bit and even and
keep it really really not true and
minimal so I'm just going to directly
just pump on my finger and then kind of
apply in tiny tiny dots in the areas
that are problematic so like around your
nose the chin lobe in the t-zone maybe
even on the top of the eyelids because
sometimes you get like little veins on
top of your eyelid that you might want
to cover up personally I don't like the
look of it then I'm going to be using a
foundation brush this one is from the
set that I got on DX Mall and it's
really really good so I'm just going to
be using that to blend everything in and
I mean if you've got really nice skin
already you don't need to apply any
foundation I mean that you may want to
just apply some concealer underneath the
eyes to make your skin look a little bit
more glowing and look less tired so if
you have my skin then don't don't bother
using foundation because it's it's just
going to ruin it at the end of the day
so you can just skip the step and move
on to
concealer so once that's done I'm going
to move on to concealer the concealer
I'm going to be using is the number
seven instant radiance concealer I'm
going to try and keep this tutorial very
drugstore base because I know most of
you are going to be quite young and not
going to have the money to spend on a
lot of makeup or maybe you don't even
want to spend a lot of money on makeup
so I'm going to try and keep a drugstore
so the one that that I'm using is really
really good I'm going to be using that
underneath my eyes to just brighten that
area further because you know when you
go to school you kind of are really
tired in the morning and you can really
really tell that you're tired by your
eyes and in the dark it's just not very
appealing you just look a lot more awake
when you've got concealer on now when
the skin is done I'm going to set it all
with a powder the one that I'm using
today is the stay matte by Rimmel and
this is my absolutely favorite powder
I'm going to shade warm beige 0:06 and
I'm just going to be using a big fluffy
brush to kind of Pat that all over to
set the makeup if you have oily skin
like me then this step is really really
good to do but if you have dry skin then
just don't go over there if you find
that your makeup does get oily
throughout the day if you do have oily
skin then just take this with you to
school with a little face brush and you
can just retouch your makeup at school
when it's just really really easy
another alternative to that is using
little blotting sheets you can get them
from any drugstore makeup store and they
are just literally a little bit of paper
and you kind of DAB it on your skin in
the oily areas in a picks up the oil
from your skin and makes it look more
matte next I'm going to be moving on to
the eyebrows if you have for eyebrows
then don't bother but if you're like me
and your eyebrows a little bit sparse
then you can go in with this step and
the other kit I'm going to be using is
the beauty UK which is like my all-time
favorite eye brow thing and I use this
with a little brush this is actually a
concealer brush but I really really like
how precise it is so I just use it for
my eyebrows so I'm just losing the
combination of this one and this one
which are the light brown shades I'm
just going to be filling in the sparse
areas just make sure that you create
little strokes to kind of imitate the No
of the actual eyebrow have now make it
look much more realistic and not drawn
on now because this is a school maker
we've got to keep the eye very neutral
and for this I want to be using the MU
eye palette I really really love this
one because it's really neutral and the
shades are just perfect this one is in
undress me too
so if you want to get this it's really
really good it's like four pounds and
you get twelve shades which is amazing
I'm going to be using a combination of
shimmery and matte shadows but the
shimmer shadows aren't going to be too
harsh because we want the look to look
very natural and obviously natural shape
aren't shimmery
so the first chatter that I'm going to
be using is this one right here which is
like a really nice base shadow to just
brighten up the area and I'm just
applying that with a big fluffy brush
all over the lid I'm just going to Pat
that on to get really get the richness
of the opaque shadow next I'm going to
be using this really light brown shade
which is this one right there and this
is a matte shadow and I'm just going to
pop that in the crease and I very
lightly and really really learned it out
to make it look very natural and almost
like you don't have actual makeup on
highlighting your crease will also make
your eyes appear larger therefore in
turn you will look more awake next I'm
going to reach for a smaller fluffy
brush and using the same brown shadow
I'm just going to be popping that
underneath the lash line to kind of make
it less top-heavy once the eye shadow is
done you can move on to the eyeliner and
the one that I'm going to be using today
is this one and this is from collection
and this is called the Xtreme 24-hour
felt tip liner and this is really really
good because of the fat tip end and it's
really really easy to control especially
those of you who are beginners and not
very confident with eyeliner so I really
really recommend for you guys to try
this one and this is really really
affordable as well so doing this look
really really neutral I'm gonna stay as
close to the lash line as possible and
this is just going to make the lash line
appear a little bit thicker and we're
going to create some definition in the
eyes
we're also not going to create a wing
because that really takes away from the
natural looking I
if you'd like to define your lower
lashline to I recommend using a brown
eyeliner and I think that this is a
really really nice shade for your eyes
to just line the bottom lash line
because it looks very very natural and
it makes any makeup look look very soft
if you would like to go a step further
you can always use a flesh tone or white
eyeliner I think that flesh tone look
most natural and I'm going to using this
to kind of line my waterline and this
will just open up the eye a little bit
more and make you look a lot more awake
you also go in to the inner corner to
just lighten up that area a little bit
to finish off the eyes we're going to go
in with a few coats of mascara on them
sky that I wanted reason today is the
Burberry one and it looks like this I
really really like this it makes your
lashes really long but if you want to
opt for a draw storm scar then I really
recommend this one and this is the Max
Factor 2000 calorie I really really like
this stuff so using the Burberry mascara
I'm just going to apply a few coats of
that on not too much because you don't
want your lashes to look gross spidery
and fake you want them to look really
natural and separated
now that the eyes are finished we can
move on to blush and the blush on one
reason today is the slick one and this
is in shade likes a peach 92 I really
really love this one it really makes
your face look awake and really healthy
and it's just amazing so I really really
love this and the rest I'm going to be
using to apply it is the Sigma flat
kabuki f80
now this step is optional but I'm going
to use a highlighter to just add a
little bit of dimension to my cheeks and
just to make my face look a little bit
more glowing and healthy and the
highlighter that I'm gonna be using is
at the 17:1 this is instant glow shimmer
brick and I really really love this it's
one of the best drugstore highlighters
that I've ever used it's really
affordable as well so I'm going to be
using it this massive massive fan brush
probably find yourself with this and
just kind of swirl that in there and
just apply it on my cheekbone now to
finish up the look the lips and I really
really like nude lips and for school I
think that this would be great but I
think I'm going to give you two options
here so the first one is a lip balm it's
by the brand Vaseline and this is a
strawberry one I'm almost out of it but
it just gives a nice moisture to your
lips as well as a little bit of color
everything that's just great because a
lipstick can be quite hard to maintain
especially for out the school day it
just smudges and it's a chore to kind of
maintain and you know check out with you
if it's not in your teeth and all that
stuff but if you use a kind of skin tone
/ natural-looking lipstick then I don't
think it's too bad so I really really
like this one it's not a drugstore
lipstick this is a by Estee Lauder but
I'm pretty sure you could find similar
shades like this in any drugstore shop
and this is really nice because it's
matte but it's really similar to your
natural lip tone so I'm just going to
lightly dab that all over the lip and if
you dab a lipstick on your lips it comes
out a little bit less pigmented
and a lot more natural and that is all
for my make it story I hope you guys
enjoyed this if you did give it a big
thumbs up and if you're not subscribed
yet then please do because I'd love to
have you here and I hope you guys
enjoyed this I hope you guys recreate
this look because I think it's really
really natural and I think it can really
make you feel confident with not too
much makeup so if you do recreate it
please tag me on instagram or twitter
and i'll have a look and yeah that'd be
great so thank you for watching and i'll
see my next one bye
these first my bag is this one for now
and it's the loot on speedy 30 monogram
