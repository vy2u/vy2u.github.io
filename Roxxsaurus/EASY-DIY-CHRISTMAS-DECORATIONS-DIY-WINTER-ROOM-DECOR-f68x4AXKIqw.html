as you guys can see I'm in a slightly
different setup today I'm sat in my
living room because I'm gonna be filming
a winter DIY room decor and I was so
excited for this video today I'm going
to show you guys how to achieve a four
different room decor ideas for winter
that you can just DIY by yourself and
these are two of my favorites from the
video and I'm so excited to show you
guys how to make these okay see if you
guys want to see how to achieve these
DIYs then let's get on into the video so
for the very first DIY we're going to be
creating this really cute twig star now
this is really simple and easy to make
it's so affordable because you can let
you just pick some twigs from a park so
for this DIY you're gonna need five
twigs which you want them to be quite
straight and also the same length as
each other so what I'm gonna do first is
I'm gonna lay them out flat into the
shape of a star and then glue the edges
together with some hot glue
once all the twigs are secured into that
shape I'm gonna take a little bit of
some string and I'm just gonna tie every
edge of the star with this to make it
look as if the twigs are tied rather
than glued together the string really
gives it that rustic effect and once
it's finished you can just add some
fairy lights to it and it looks really
really cute it almost looks like you
could buy this in a store but you
literally made this yourself in like
less than five minutes
now the next mint to DIY is this really
cute pom-pom pillow that we literally
made in under five pounds so for this
you're gonna need a plain white cushion
you can buy from pretty much any store
and then taking some gray felts and I'm
just cutting out tree shapes into this
as she decided not to make a stencil and
just kind of do it by hand because I
wanted to each of the tree to have a
slightly different shape this really
gives each tree that unique effect
because not all of them have to be at
the exact same carbon-copy
so once I've cut out all of the felt
trees I then just had decided to lay
them all over the pillow in the pattern
that I wanted before I actually glued
them down so I decided to lay out the
trees in a row of four and then three
four and three again and I think that
the alternating pattern really gives it
a cool effect I'm then gonna take a hot
glue gun and just glue each of the trees
onto the cushion now you can of course
use a fabric glue but I didn't have any
so I just decided to use some hot glue
it works just as well now to finish off
our pillow we're going to be making our
very own pom poms this is actually
surprisingly easy and I never even knew
this but you can make your own pom poms
at home so for this what you need is
just a little bit of cardboard depending
on how big you want your pom poms to be
or with a small slit in the very center
of it I'm then taking some white yarn
and I'm just going to wrap this around
the cardboard and secure it so that it's
tied together and then I'm just gonna
take that yarn and just wrap it around
as many times as you like once I wrapped
it around enough times I'm then gonna
take a small piece of string and I'm
just gonna wrap this around through the
slits to kind of tie off the very center
of the pom pom all you need to do then
is just remove the yarn from the actual
cardboard and then just cut through all
of the looped edges and that is your pom
pom complete if your pom pom is a little
bit messy you can go ahead and just use
some scissors to trim off any of the
longer strands that you don't really
need that I'll then go ahead and take my
pom poms and just hot glue that onto the
edges of the pillows on each of the four
corners and I think this looks so cute
it really gives it that cozy vibe and it
really transforms the pillow
father next DIY we're gonna be creating
our very own roof this is so cheap to
make and I love how it turned out so the
very first thing you're gonna need is a
hoop that you're gonna use as a template
for your roof and then you're gonna need
some rosemary branches and also some
string so the first thing you want to do
is take a rosemary branch and just tie
that on to the actual template of the
roof you can find rosemary branches in
any supermarket for super cheap but it's
really cool because it actually really
resembles a Christmas tree branch so
what you want to do for this wreath is
just keep building up those branches
keep tying it to the metal hoop so you
just want to keep it building up those
rosemary branches to get the perfect
wreath once I have got my desired
thickness on my reef I then went ahead
and added a low ornament that I picked
up from hobby craft you can add whatever
you want you could add some Holly or you
can add some pinecones
it's really up to you but I love how
this turned out it looks super festive
and it was so inexpensive to make plus
it smells amazing
now the very last DIY is the cutest
thing I have ever seen on Pinterest and
you can actually get things like this
from a shop called anthropology but of
course we're gonna make our own so to
create one of these Christmas tree
ornaments what you're gonna need is some
felt fabric and also a twig the first
thing you want to do is cut your felt
fabric into a half and then just overlay
those two pieces of fabric on top of
each other so that when you cut through
the fabric you can get multiple designs
of the same stencil so again you can of
course a map out and draw a a design on
top of the felt fabric if you like but I
just meant freehand because I know the
shape of a Christmas tree pretty well
once I have my four pieces of the fout
trees I'm then going to take my twig and
just draw a line of glue on top of the
twig and then attach one of the
Christmas trees to the stick I'm then
gonna fold this over and then do the
same thing again so I'm just gonna pop
the glue onto the stick and then just
pop another tree onto that stick you
then just want to repeat the step over
and over again until the whole
circumference of the tree is covered by
the foul so once the tree is finished it
should look something like this and to
actually make it stand I bought this
little star from hobby craft and I'm
gonna use this as the base of the tree
so I'm just hot gluing that on and just
waiting for it to dry and this is what
my three trees turned out like I created
a white gray and green one and I loved
them so much they look so cute and
creative and this was such an easy DIY
to make but I think that it really looks
like it could be bought in the store
that is all for my video I really hope
