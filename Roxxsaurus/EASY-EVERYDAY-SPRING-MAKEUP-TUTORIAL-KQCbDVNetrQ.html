channel I hope you guys have an awesome
day so far the internet video I've had a
great opportunity to be working with
King and the developer of the game of
bubble which three I've just read I
lighted the new version and it's even
more awesome bonus to make you sane see
King for sponsoring this video I am so
excited to be playing the game again and
I'm even more excited because I am
actually a character in the game this is
what I look like in the game and I'm
going to be in the game for one week
from today onwards the game is a super
easy to play literally anyone can play
it and all you have to do is just shoot
bubbles and match the different colors
of the bubble and when the bubbles all
clear from that level you can move on to
the next one if you guys have like a
spare 10 minutes in your day you can
just like relax by playing the game
that's what I love doing so in today's
video I'm going to be showing you guys
how to achieve this spring look inspired
by the main character Stella the witch
and even though it's not Halloween I
still love her looks like she's just so
fresh face and just really pretty and
cute so I thought I would create this a
neutral like really pretty fresh look
for you guys and hope you guys like it
so make sure you guys download the game
we're down in the description by
clicking the link and you get to see
those more exclusive footage from me and
also some tips and tricks throughout the
game both are going to let's get into
the video there to save a little bit of
time I've already applied my base I'm
gonna move straight into contouring so
for this I'm going to be using my master
con chopsticks I absolutely love it
because it's so easy to blend so I'm
just going to apply this into the
hollows of my cheeks my temples my nose
and I'm going to blend everything out
with this little brush that I got from
frame up the other day I'm not going to
because with the blush and which Stella
from the game has a really really very
cheap and to replicate this I'm going to
take my nutty London at blush brush and
shade Zayn this is such a beautiful
natural looking shade I'm just going to
sweep it onto the apples of my cheek for
that really natural flush to the face
the character which seller also has some
really cute freckles that just on her
cheeks so I'm going to add those in with
this little lip liner from the body shop
but I'm just taking them this liner and
just gently adding some freckles by
twisting this onto my skin
so those are the photos that finished I
also use love freckles they just make
everyone look so much cuter I'm now
going to move on to the eyes and for the
eye shadow I'm going to be taking my two
favorite sweet peach palette and from
this palette I'm going to be taking in
the shade Georgia as a transition color
when I think it's lucky brush like this
one I'm going to take this shadow and
apply this into my crease add a nice
transition base color and that we're
going for is a very kind of neutral
buttery pinky and girly colors are
absolutely perfect for the spring I just
say this palette literally smells like
peaches is amazing now that my
transition color is in place I'm going
to take the shadow detectible which is
this really nice kind of perfectly
shadow applying this with my tiny pencil
brush and this is going to make it
really wearable because we're not going
all out with the purple we're just
adding a small pop of color with the
purple just next to the lash line I'm
not also going to change this purple
eyeshadow and just apply this onto my
lower lash line it just underneath this
is going to tie the whole look together
after line the lashes I'm just going to
be using a felt tip liner from eiko and
I'm not actually going to be creating a
winged liner today I'm just going to be
lining the top lashline with a very thin
and subtle line and ending out at the
edge of the eye so now that my liner is
done I can move on to mascara and for my
top lashes I'm going to be using and B
Too Faced better than sex mascara so I'm
just applying a few coats of this onto
my lashes just to emphasize them make
them thicker and longer and now it's my
bottom lashes I'm going to be using at
the Great Lash mascara from Maybelline
New York this mascara is a really great
for catching all of those little bottom
lashes so I'm just going to apply a few
coats of this as well now lastly I'm
going to move on to my lips I'm just
going to return it back to the same that
lip liner from the body shop and just
line my lips with it and lovely to
finish off the lip I'm going to be using
my Too Faced sweet peach creamy peach
lip will go off it isn't shade at pure
peach and I'm just going to apply this
to the very center of my lip and this is
the finished is spring look inspired by
Stella which I
we love that I think it's so pretty it's
really fresh and just really neutral
there's gonna be perfect for spring I
usually wear wings I know as you guys
already know but I really love how this
lip turned out with no wing liner at all
I think it's just a little bit more
wearable and it's more natural-looking
that is all for this look I really hope
you guys enjoyed it don't forget to
check out the app bubble which three I
would love you guys to download it and
play it with me and transpired my
character because they absolutely love
like that I'm a character in the game by
the way you can only find my character
after level 15 so you have to play up
until that level before you can actually
see me as a character in the game so it
is a little bit of a challenge but I'm
sure you guys are going to smash it and
you're going to be amazing at the game
that is all for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't already come in
join as a dinosaur family and also give
this video a thumbs up if you did like
it so I know to create more like spring
looks like this that is all from me I
