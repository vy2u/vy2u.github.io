channel I hope you guys are well so
today I'm doing yet another Halloween
makeup tutorial and this time I'm going
to be doing at this half skull half
normal face makeup look it's actually
pretty straightforward because you're
only doing one side of your face that's
like the painterly and extreme side and
then the other side is just your regular
face of makeup also you guys like my
jumper I think I'm a little bit in love
with it I got this from H&amp;amp;M just today
and it's got bats all over it it's
pretty amazing so if you guys enjoyed

looks from me then I'll have the little
playlist of my Halloween series in the
corner to spare so you guys can check
those out but if you guys want to see
how to recreate this look then oh let's
get to it so to start off the makeup I'm
going to use a contact lens and put this
in my eye first I'm then moving straight
to the skin I'm going to be using my
body shop wander blur skin smoother and
I'm applying this all over my face to
achieve an even base underneath our
foundation and face paint moving on to
the foundation I'm using the fresh nude
foundation by the body shop and this is
in shade barley vanilla I'm then
reaching for a bronzing powder in shade
medium matte this is a really nice cool
toned bronzer so I'm just using this to
sculpt out my cheek and my temple of
this to add a bit of highlight to the
face I'm reaching for the shimmer waves
by the body shop in shade blush and I'm
applying this to my cheek bone I'm then
moving on to the eyes using the down to
earth I pallets and firstly taking this
neutral matte shadow and I'm placing
this in my crease as a transition shadow
as well as blending this into my lower
lash line next I'm taking this brown
eyeshadow and I'm placing this in my
outer V and to finish off the eye I'm
using the black shadow and I'm basically
applying this even further into the
outer V to deepen up and I'm also
blending this down to my lower lash
I'm not taking at the bodyshop liquid
liner and I'm creating a subtle wing
line out of this and then to top of my
eyes I'm going to be using the bodyshop
super Volume Mascara and I'm applying a
few coats of this to my top and bottom
lashes my lip I wanted to go with a nice
bold red color so I'm using one of their
new liquid lipsticks from the body shop
I actually decided that this color was a
dark enough so I went in with a darker
shade and I created kind of like a
gradient effect I'm not taking a brown
brow pencil and I'm just basically
outlining where I want my skull to be
and once I'm happy with that I'm going
to go in with a black liquid liner to
emphasize the lines I'm then taking a
white face paint and just filling in the
white portion of the skull you could
also use the white shade adjusting drops
from the bodyshop if you have those and
doing the same with the black face paint
and creating the hollows in the negative
spaces now for the teeth what you want
to do is extend the corner of your mouth
and just draw vertical lines from Nats
and it should look something like this
I'm then filling in the teeth with some
extra white face paint and then just
using my black liquid liner to kind of
make the teeth a little bit more rounded
at the roots and then returning back to
the black face thing and I'm just
filling in the hollows of my jaw you
don't want to grab a blending brush with
some black eyeshadow and just use this
as a shading tool so what I'm doing here
is I'm just shading the teeth from the
outer edges inwards to create the
illusion of a free dimensional tooth I'm
then going ahead and just adding a
little bit of highlight to the teeth to
really make them stand out even more the
last part of the skull is the detail so
all you want to do is just draw a few
lines around the eyes and maybe around
the nose and I'm also adding a few
cracks here and there just to make the
skull look a little bit more scary
I'm then returning back to my black
eyeshadow and with a fluffy blending
brush I'm just applying this to the
circumference of my skull and also
anywhere where I feel like there needs a
little bit more depth and that is the
finished look I think this looks so
effective and it didn't even take me
that long so this is perfect for a
last-minute Halloween costume so that is
all for my high school Halloween makeup
tutorial I love this look so so much I
think it's one of my favorites I
actually created this look for the shout
magazine and I had a little double
spread feature in the magazine which was
so so cool because I still read that
magazine when I was a kid and it's
insane to actually be inside it now but
yeah I think this look is super simple
to do it's not too long because you're
ready doing one side of your face but
everyone is going to be so so impressed
and also if you wanted to you could also
drag the face bow down to your neck and
maybe do like a spine I think that would
look super cool and really tie the whole
look together but that is all for me I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you very soon in my next
one bye the commencement of the annual
purge sanctioned by the US government</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
