you how to create this a 3d tumblr
inspired hairstyle braids thing for
school um you can also use this for work
you can use this for any occasion
actually it's pretty versatile and I
just really love it because it's so
simple and anyone can do it Before we
jump straight into this video I quickly
want to mention an app that I've been
loving recently and it's good clue um
it's actually really really good for
girls so all of you guys out there that
are watching this is going to be like a
lifesaver basically so the app is called
clue um it looks like this and it's
basically an app that helps you track
your menstrual cycle and lets you
predict when your period is going to be
but this app you also know what days
you're most likely to get pregnant so I
think that's pretty spot the app is
actually free so anyone can download it
it's available on Android iOS and also
the Apple watch and for those of you who
are on the pill it's also good um to
have this app because it reminds you
every day to take a pill so you don't
forget so it's got like a calendar
option here as well and your history and
your cycle of course and also found out
that the more you actually input of your
details like your height your weight and
stuff like that actually tells you a
more accurate reading of what's
happening in your body so I think that's
pretty cool so yeah I thought I would
just shout out this app because I think
it's important for us girls to like know
things about our body so yeah if you
guys don't check it out then I'll have
the link in the description but without
further ado let's just jump right into
this hairstyle so this hairstyle is
super easy and super simple and the only
two things that you're going to need are
two hair ties so what you want to do
fast is you want to put your hair all
the way to one side and I'm just tying
that into a low ponytail onto the side
once you've got something like this you
can take a strand of hair and wrap that
around the hair tie to conceal it once
the hair tight is concealed
you're going to split your hair into
three equal sections as you would for a
regular braid so take in the first
section of your hair you're going to
split that into two equal sections like
this and you're going to loop this
middle section through like so and as
you can see the split section is now in
the middle so what you're going to do
with these two sections is you're just
going to twist them once and once you've
twisted it you're going to loop that
last section through so you are left
with the split section on to the far
right and that is the whole process
complete you're going to be just
repeating that over and over again so
again you're splitting the section from
the far left into two you're looping the
middle section through you're twisting
the two strands and then you're looping
the last section through and then you're
pulling it as tight as possible you want
this bread to be really really tight to
get the best effect out of it and just
once again splitting the last section
looping the middle through like so
twisting these two to the right and then
looping the last section for this split
parts
then once you're done you can tie that
whole thing with a hair tie so the whole
braid looks something like this so it's
got some kind of dimension from every
single angle making it a 3d braid so
this is the final hairstyle I hope you
guys like yeah I think it's really easy
super simple but it looks like you've
made a lot of effort so that's always
good will it really took you about five
minutes to do so that is all for this
video if you guys did enjoy it then
definitely give it a big thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already I'd
love to have you here I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day and I'll see
you very soon in my next video bye
