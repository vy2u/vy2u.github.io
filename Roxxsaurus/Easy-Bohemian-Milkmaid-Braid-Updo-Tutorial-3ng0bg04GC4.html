you how to achieve this really quick
really easy but still really cute um
hair updo it's called the bohemian
milkmaid headband braid thing and it's
basically two braids going up into a
headband meeting together looks really
cute really easy loads of celebrities
have been rocking this hairstyle so yes
and these bits are kind of cute but
anyway anyway I will just start this is
getting a bit weird so the things that
you're going to need are two headbands
like this um it's good to have headbands
that look very similar to your natural
hair color and blend very well so
they're not noticeable it's also good to
have really like small elastic bands and
are see-through and because you won't be
able to see them but because I don't
have them want to use these and you're
also going to need some bobby pins or
hair clips I've got these ones that
black but um I've got red hair but I'm
sure I can work with them so yeah let's
get that okay so the first thing you
need to do is split your hair in a
middle parting you can do any sort
partner you like but I find that it just
works better with a middle parting so
I've kind of split my hair into a messy
part just a little bit off to the side
because that's how my hair just
naturally works so we're going to split
split it all the way down to the back
separate the two bits of hair then
you're going to take one side and just
simply separate it into three bits as
you would for a regular braid and just
start braiding it and I recommend to do
this step right below the ear and
slightly off to the back of
a head like so and I mean you can get
really creative with this bet you can
you can do like a fishtail braid or an
inverted braid and you kind of bro that
you're on really but this one is just
the easiest
and then you're just going to want to
secure that quite tight so that it
doesn't come undone throughout the day
and yes so that's one side done and you
just repeat the same to the other side
you can also put up some bits of your
hair to kind of frame your face and
we're going to call those later
so I've got two of my braids now and
again I'm just going to pull out a
little section of hair that we're going
to curl later to kind of frame the face
a little better and the next step is
probably the easiest bit and we have to
do it is you have to pull up your hair
like this
from this side so you have to clip it to
the side like so so I'm just going to
take some bobby pins and really really
secure it in there so that it stays
there all day and don't fall out and
what we're going to do this bit is we're
just going to hide it into the hair like
so so that's one side done now we're
just taking the other side and doing
exactly the same but kind of overlapping
of the braid so first up front to cover
the bobby not the bump and cover the
headband and
it over to the other side and we're
going to conceal this headband
underneath this braid
now I'm just returning back and pinning
any fly outs like this one it's going to
take the underneath the braid and put it
in okay so now that everything is
clipped into place you can start tugging
out some bits and pieces to make it look
more messy so I'm just going to tuck
some bits out near the ears and maybe
behind your back just kind of scruff it
up a little bit because it's supposed to
look quite messy and now we can move on
to curling these bad boys so for curling
and these bits I'm going to be using the
Remington curling wand so this it goes
up to quite high but I'm going to use
the engine 80 setting what I like about
curling wands is that it gives you the
variety of curls you can either have
like a really thick curl or really kind
of angel curl and yes that's why I'm
using a wand
today I'm just taking I'm going to
separate the kind of fringy bits into
two parts and I'm just taking that like
this and I'm curling it away from my
face like so I'm going to hold it for a
few seconds and then release and it
looks like this how pretty is that quite
pretty then I'm going to take the other
bit and do the same
and I'm just the lower kind of scrunch
it up a little bit to make you a bit
more messy and that's it doing the same
to the other side what I'm going to do
now is kind of mess up a little bit
further by pulling apart the braid so
that gives a more of a bohemian kind of
vibe and looks still quite cool so just
just mess in messing around pulling out
some more beds
or in our there so this is the final
look guys I hope you enjoy it this
hairstyle is really easy really quick to
do yet it looks like you put a lot of
effort into it so you can definitely
rock this every day or maybe to like a
special date or add a note any place
really because it's just so quick so
easy and very girly gets to a hair up
the face but still looks cute so yes I
hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
