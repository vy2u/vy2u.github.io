another back-to-school hairstyle video
and in this video I'm going to be
showing you guys a combination of
hairstyles with curly hair and also
straight hair so about there really
let's jump right in
so for this first hairstyle I'm going to
be creating a bun as you can see it's
not a regular bun it's got a little
detail on the back which I think looks
really nice and it's very easy to do
so first of all I'm going to be taking
this top section of my hair and clipping
it out of the way I'm taking about
halfway down my head so now we've got
this back section here that we can take
care of and I'm just gathering that all
in a ponytail
once you have this little ponytail in
the back you can start twisting that to
create it in a bun I'm taking another
hair tie and just placing that over the
bun now that we've got this lovely
little bun we can take care of this
section at the top what I'm actually
going to be doing is taking some batiste
dry shampoo and I'm spraying that
through the hair just to give it a
little bit more volume and texture and
next I'm taking my tangle teezer just to
tease this section of hair to get a lot
more volume
now I'm taking these two sections of
hair to the back and what we're going to
be doing with these sections is twisting
them around the bun but alternating the
direction of which way they're being
twisted up so I'm taking this first
section and I'm twisting it around like
so then I'm taking a bobby pin and I'm
pinning that in place
and then I'm taking the other section
and twisting it in the other direction
so this is the first test op and I think
it just looks really cute with the
crossover detailing at the back I think
it looks very classy and timeless and
it's perfect for school to get your hair
out of your face so the next hair stop
is going to be sort of like a braided
updo so I'm just starting by taking
strands from each side of my hair on the
front and then I'm pulling them back and
crossing them over behind this is just
going to create a soft transition into a
fishtail braid
as you can see I'm not taking the braids
and starting to roll it up on itself and
this is just going to create that really
romantic and feminine looking hairdo
once it's nicely tucked in I can then go
in with my bobby pins and make sure that
it stays in place all day and doesn't
unroll and fall out now to finish it up
I've pulled out some bits to frame my
face and I'm actually gonna curl them
just add a little bit more of a delicate
factor to this hairstyle the curling one
that I'm going to be using today is the
nume titan-3 which looks like this I've
got the blue version which I'm really
stoked about this one that actually
comes with three different barrels this
one is the thickest one and that's the
one I'm going to be using today it also
comes with a little one and a
medium-size one so it actually gives you
a lot of variety and it's sort of like
you get three different curling wands in
one which is amazing another good thing
about this one is that it comes with a
glove and I burned myself a lot when I
call my how because I'm not so used to
it so this is very helpful so I'm just
taking my wand and I'm taking this
section of hair and just curling it away
from my face and I'm just gonna repeat
that same step to the other side so
that's this hairstyle done I think it's
so gorgeous I think it's really really
easy to do but it looks like you've put
a lot of effort into it so this is what
it looks like from the back but this
next head start I'm going to be taking
my hair color again and when you're
curling the whole head of hair this this
video is sponsored by new me I have two
coupon codes for you guys and I'll link
them both down below to get $100 off of
any styling set you can use the code or
oxydol and I also have that linked down
below
so as you can see I've achieved these
soft curls they're almost like a wave
rather than curl it looks very
unintentional like my hair is naturally
curls or things so I really like that a
lot and now we can move on to the
hairstyle so I'm going to be taking
these two sections of hair and I'm going
to be just simply twisting so I'm taking
the first section and then the second
section from the bottom and now I'm just
going to be twisting them on the each
other like so and then adding a bit more
hair to the twist all right we twist it
we add more hair and twist it again and
add more hair again and so on and so on
when you get to the back of your head
all you want to do is just pin that in
place and then we're going to repeat the
same to the other side
so this is the hair stop finish I think
it's really nice for those days when
you're running late for school because
it's really simple but again it looks
like you put a lot of effort into this
hairstyle and this is what it looks like
from the back so that is all for my back
