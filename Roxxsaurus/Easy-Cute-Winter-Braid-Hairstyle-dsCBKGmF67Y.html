festive braid hairstyle this is very
autumnal due to this gorgeous headband I
think this is such a classic like
wintery and Christmasy kind of hairstyle
that you could wear for Christmas Eve
and it would be gorgeous I really like
how this hair song looks prepared with a
dark red lip as well so if you guys try
this hairstyle out work on some red
lipstick and you're good to go don't
forget to give this video a like if you
enjoyed it and let's just crack on into
the hairstyle so what you're needing for
this hairstyle is some hair grips or
bobby pins and also some hair ties I
often call these Hannibal's which most
people make fun of but that's just what
I call them so you're going to want to
start by sectioning off your hair into a
middle parting and I'm aware that a bit
of person doesn't suit everyone I don't
really know if it suits me so if you
don't like having a middle parting then
you can always position it slightly
off-center and that will work too so
what you want to do is you want to take
one half and sort of take the top
section and then you're going to
separate that into three sections and
you're going to simply braid it
so you're going to braid it underneath
like so I think this is called a Dutch
braid but I'm not sure correct me if I'm
wrong so what you do is take one section
and place it underneath the other so it
ends up in the middle and then you take
the one from the other side and also
place it in the middle so it's just that
kind of process over and over again once
you've done it once you want to add
another strand of hair to the section
that you're about to put in the middle
like this
so I'm just adding that into the already
existing strand pulling that into the
middle
as you're doing this you want it to be
quite tight so it doesn't stick out from
your head so much once you get to this
sore top back of your head kind of side
and you can just continue braiding the
rest of the braid without adding any
sections to it once you're at the end
all you want to do is take your head
tight and just tie that in place so it
doesn't unravel now to take it a step
further you can go back to the braid and
sort of tug on it a little bit to pull
it apart and make it more wider and
volumize you can skip this step if your
hair is already really thick but I'm
just gonna go ahead and do this step and
yes you have guessed it we are now just
going to repeat the same to the other
side you're going to be taking the
section from the back of your head
placing that in the middle and then
taking the front section and also
placing that in the middle once you've
done that once you want to add strands
of hair so I'm just going to take some
from the back and combine it with the
already existing strand and then I'm
placing that in the middle as you can
see here then I'm moving on back to this
section and I'm adding a strand of hair
from the front and weaving that into the
braid some once again I'm taking it off
a hair tie and just tying that in place
so it doesn't unravel now that I've got
my two braids I'm actually going to be
reaching for this really gorgeous gold
leaf umm metal headband I got this from
Claire's if anyone is wondering and I
think it's just such a gorgeous like
autumnal and wintery headband I think
it's absolutely gorgeous so what I'm
going to be doing is I'm just going to
be placing that over my head like so and
as you can see there's this black band
up the back which we're going to be
covering with these braids in a second
because this headband has a band at the
back we're actually going to be able to
use this to create a little bit of
volume to the back of the head so I'm
just pushing some of the hair over the
band and that's just going to create
that little bit of volume in the crown
of the hair
so I'm now taking my braid and I'm just
kind of placing that over the black
balance to cover it up like so well
you're happy with the positioning of
your braid you can go in with your hair
grips and just pin it all in place
I'm not moving on to the upper braid and
I'm just repeating the same step so when
the bobby pins it's important to have
enough to kind of support the two braids
in place so that they don't unravel
because we're actually going to be
unraveling the braids up to the point
where the bobby pins meet so if the
braids aren't supported properly then
they will unravel throughout the day so
now that my two braids are supported I'm
just taking one of the braids and I'm
literally unraveling the braid that we
created and I'm just unraveling out to
the point where we've pinned it down
kind of thing so this is the final leg I
hope you guys enjoyed this hairstyle and
if you decide to recreate it then
definitely tag me on Instagram or
Twitter
on another note I'm so excited that it's
finally December and I'm planning to
make many Christmasy themed videos so if
you guys have any suggestions for any
Christmasy festive kind of videos that
you'd like to see on my channel then
definitely let me know down below and
I'll try and get back to you with your
requests if you enjoyed this hairstyle

I'll see you very soon in my next one
