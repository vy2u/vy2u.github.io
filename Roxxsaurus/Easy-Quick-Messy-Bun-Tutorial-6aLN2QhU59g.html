hairstyle and some of you requested a
tutorial for it it's really simple
really easy but I thought I'd just show
you how I do it and let's jump right so
what you're going to need are some bobby
pins or hair grips which already call
them a hairband or a bubble and some a
dry shampoo
it's a dry shampoo that I got from super
brands but you can always get it from
Tesco's and Boots and I love this stunt
I think this works just as well as the
batiste one and it's so much cheaper and
it also smells good this hairstyle works
best on second or third day hair if your
hair is clean and just wash you can use
this baby and this is a golf best friend
and this will just give your hair a bit
more texture and volume and body so your
hairstyle will actually stay in place
and it will be easier to mold so I'm
just going to shake it and apply it to
my roots and just focus on the crown
area make sure that if you're dry
shampoo has won't residue to brush that
all out you don't look like you've got
no hair and as you can tell I look like
a lion now the first step is you're
going to take all of your hair up and
into a high ponytail as you normally
would
once you've got your paint out all up
and neat you can pull out some bits just
to frame your face a little bit
and it's good to pull these out whilst
we've still got hold of your ponytail
because if you pull up too much you can
always put it back into the ponytail as
you can see this is bit too long fill it
back so moving on to the actual ponytail
I'm going to take my hair tie and just
tie it around as you would with a normal
pen detail just secure it then when
you're on the last Sitaram tie you want
to pull it out but not all the way you
want to pull it out so it creates this
sort of little shape and then you're
going to take two fingers and pull it
through the little loop that you just
created take the rest of your hair and
pull it through I hope you can see that
next I'm going to just mold this whole
bun around like so and this bun is very
huge right now but we're just going to
tame that and pin it together
so once you're happy with the body of
your bun you can move on to the front
sections and I'm just going to be
pulling out just a tiny bit more hair at
the front here and also some hair by my
ears and then maybe some at the back
just to give the look a bit more messy
factor I'm also going to be tugging on
this part of my hair just to give it a
bit more volume another thing I like
doing is taking these front sections
from my face and just tucking them
behind my ears and then just simply
pulling out little bits just my ears and
I just think that it looks a bit more
casual and it gets the hair out of your
face and they have it this is how I do
my bun I think this is a great technique
to do it if you don't have one of those
hair donut's to put in your bun to make
it a bit bigger I think just comes out
very volumize without having to tease
your hair or anything like that I mean
of course if you have thinner hair you
might want to tease your hair but
because my hair is very thick anyway I
didn't want to tease it to add even more
volume I suppose so I hope you guys
enjoyed this really quick head to toe
it's not really rocket science but I
just thought I'd share my technique and
how I do it and yeah before I go I want
to give a quick shout out Hannah Jeffery
is one of my really special viewers who
recently took me a lovely message saying
that she's been suffering depression and
that watching my videos have helped her
get through it and get better and that
means so much to me that I could help
some of you um it's crazy and I love you
all I need to know that you're beautiful
and um I don't know oh just hi thank you
for your message it really made my day
but that is all I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I'll see you in my next
one bye
flowers I think it's really beautiful
very dainty and it's just a classic all
black little black dress sort of shapes
and I just love it so much and this cost
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
