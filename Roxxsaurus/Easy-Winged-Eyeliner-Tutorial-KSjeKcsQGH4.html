hi guys today I'm going to be filming at
this eyeliner tutorial this has been
highly requested and I'm not too sure
why but let's just jump right in so I'm
going to be showing you some tips and
tricks on how I achieve my eyeliner I
use a few different ones so I'll just
show you a variety of things that I do
the first thing I usually use is a Kohl
eyeliner and this one is the Rimmel
London exaggerate waterproof eye definer
this is obviously in black I do use
brown eyeliners sometimes as well when I
want a more sort of like natural and
soft and look but usually I just use a
black one and I use this to tightline my
eyes this can be kind of tricky because
you are essentially putting a pencil
inside your eyeball but you do get used
to it and my eyes still get watery up to
this day when I do it and what I do is I
sort of placed the pencil in my eye area
and then I sort of closed my eye lid on
it and then just move it around I find
that it's much easier than trying to
line it with your eyes open
so as you can see this is a really
really quick way to line your eyes and
give a lot of definition to them in no
time at all and you don't have to be
worried about going wrong and you know
smudging it everywhere because it's not
on your actual eyelid or skin it's on
the inside of your eyes if that makes
any sense now for the actual winged
liner I often use a felt tip liner like
this this is the scandalize by Rimmel
London once more and I really like a
felt tip line is because they are so
easy to control and they have a nice
thin tip which makes it really really
easy to create a wing so the first thing
that I do is I create a line that is
adjacent to my lower lash line like this
excuse me about the eyeliner guys it's
sort of drying out a little bit but this
is what I do say if you were to create a
really long line it would sort of meet
the end of your eyebrow and that is what
you should aim for and once that line is
done that you are pretty much halfway
there all you have to do is create
another line and create a triangle
when you do this try to have your mirror
just below your face so you're looking
down at it this will just make the whole
eyelid be pulled down and stretched so
you don't get any copy-and-paste going
on and then all you have to do is just
fill it in so the reason why it's very
very easy is because I don't actually
drag the eye line it into the middle
corner and that is because I feel like
it closes up the eye a lot and it's just
unnecessary work as long as you blend
the line into your lashline very well
and it ends up really thin then you are
just you're saving yourself so much work
so this is what I do and it works fine
for me now if I want a little bit more
definition I usually go for a gel liner
if I want it to last a very long time
the one that I like a lot is the
Maybelline New York it's very affordable
I've got this from super drug and then
all I do is I use a little thin brush
like this I think this is actually
concealer brush but I use it for my
eyeliner and this is by makeup for you
so what I'm going to be doing is I'm not
just going to be creating the full wing
and fall sort of eyeliner look this is
the harder one to do because you're not
just doing the outer wing you're
actually going into the inner corner so
all I'm just going to be doing is
picking up from where we left off I'm
gonna sort of go over the line we
created just to add a little bit more
definition to it without smudging it
like that
you
you
you
so that is pretty much all I do for my
everyday eyeliner it's not very hard you
know it's not like rocket science so I'm
sure your guys will be able to pick it
up pretty quick and yeah if you enjoyed
