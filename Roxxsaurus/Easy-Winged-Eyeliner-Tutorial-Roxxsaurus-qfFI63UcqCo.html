the signature wind liner tutorial I
thought it was necessary for me to do
this video I've done in the past but
something about the video like corrupted
and it made it really low-quality so i'm
reforming it i always have you guys
asking how i do my eyeliner and it's
actually really really simple so i
thought i would just make a video about
it i hope you guys enjoyed this and find
it helpful and let's just you're breaded
one of the easiest bonds of application
for eyeliner for me is by using a felt
tip liner this is the one that i'm using
at the moment it's by collection so i
think it's about three pounds or
something it's very affordable the thing
that I love most about this eyeliner is
that it's got a very very fine tip and
it's very easy to control unlike a brush
so I find that using a gel liner that's
in a tiny little pot is usually much
harder although it does last longer so I
think what you like to use is just down
to preference than me I find that this
is the quickest method to apply your
eyeliner this one is called the
collection extreme 24 hour felt tip
liner and this is the one that I use
everyday pretty much and I found that it
does stay on for quite a long time it
doesn't really budge or smudge anywhere
so you complete my eyeliner I also use a
twisting little coal liner like this
this is by Rimmel and it's called
exaggerate waterproof eyeliner the fact
that it's waterproof makes it last extra
long and it's very good for the
waterline so what I usually do is I take
the eyeliner the Kohl one all I do is I
just tight line my upper waterline I
know this is kind of tricky for some
people because your eyes can get very
watery so what I usually do is I have my
mirror on the side and I look that way
and I place my eyeliner in to my
waterline and I just close my eye on it
and then I just sort of wiggle it around
like that and I find that this is just
the easiest way to tightline your eyes
without making them super watery and it
also makes sure that you don't put
yourself in the eye because that hurts
with my eyeliner I don't usually take
any eyeliner into the inner corner
because I find that it closes up the eye
a lot so I try to avoid going into the
corner next off and at about this sort
of area and I just sort of feigned it
into the corner just so it's not too
harsh but you still get a bit of
definition to
lashline I'm just going to go ahead and
repeat that same step to the other side
as you can see my top lash line looks
much thicker now because we've tight
lined it and it's just a very subtle way
to line your eyes without actually
creating any line on the lid space this
is especially good for people who have
small lid space just like me and now for
the fun part we're going to go in with
the felt tip liner and I'm just going to
be creating the wing a core tip that I
have learnt from me my mouth one which
is my friend on YouTube is when you have
hooded eyes basically to draw your
eyeliner just a little bit lower than
your eye actually ends usually you would
just extend the line from where your
bottom waterline is but if you create
the line just to little bit lower about
here it just makes sure that the skin
doesn't drip over the line and it
doesn't hide it sort of thing so I'm
going to go ahead and do that step of
course if you don't have hooded eyes you
can skip this and you can just join it
from your lower waterline so what I'm
doing is I'm going a little bit lower
and I'm creating a little line like this
so the line that created is sort of
adjacent to my eyebrow if I was to
continue it it was almost linked to my
eye run that's what you're going to aim
for so I'm just making sure that I'm
making very small and subtle lines you
don't want to go all out and just create
one long line in one go because that is
just a recipe for disaster so take your
time doing this you want to try and have
as much control as possible and all I'm
doing now is just feeding that line back
into the lash line with very small
strokes when you're trying to fade out
the line if you have your brush position
like this and just make short downward
strokes like that it's just going to
create a very nice sharp line
and to make life easier what I usually
do is I just stop in the outer third of
my eye and just try and blend the
lashline to the actual wing so as you
can see I've stopped creating my line
right here in the outer third of my eye
and I usually don't drag the line up
over the middle part of my lashline
because I find that it can close up the
eye again and I have quite a small lid
space so if I create a line it just ends
up making my lid space look even smaller
so if you did the step where you placed
the liner just a little bit lower than
your bottom waterline you can go in a
step further and use your Kohl line and
once again and all I'm doing is I'm just
drawing that line ever so slightly and
I'm running the liner down my lower lash
line and then I'm taking the smudging
side of this liner and I'm smudging that
out a little bit this is just going to
make it look more natural like it's
supposed to be there if you have made
any mistakes do not fear you can go back
in and correct it I'm just going to be
taking a concealer of my choice and the
one I'm going to be using is a Mac
concealer it's got like three little
sections to it so I'm using the lightest
shade on a flat brush I'm just going to
be taking that underneath for this line
here just to sharpen it up a little bit
and make it more crisp
so this is the finish line uh this is
what it looks like it definitely makes a
lot of difference it does elongate and
enlarge the eye and again it's not too
dramatic because obviously we didn't go
into this inner corner here and it's
quite wearable for an everyday look
so that is all for this tutorial I hope
you guys enjoyed this and I hope you
guys find it helpful if you did then
definitely give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you haven't already I hope
you guys having a wonderful day and I'll
see you on my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
