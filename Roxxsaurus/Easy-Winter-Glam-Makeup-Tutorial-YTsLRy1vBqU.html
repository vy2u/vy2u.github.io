vlogmas videos I hope you guys like this
intro is to set the scene for this video
which is a winter glam makeup look
inspired by the 1940s this makeup look
is inspired by the new movie allied
which is coming out on the 25th of
November so a little synopsis of the
movie is that our it is the story of an
intelligent officer played by Brad Pitt
who is great by the way here in 1942 in
North America encounters French and
resistance fighter Marianne ruse which
Accardi French but that's that only
deadly mission behind enemy lines
reunited in London the relationship is
threatened by the extreme pressures of
the war oh the only dumb boy in the
description to the trailer of this movie
I think the trailer looks amazing and
I'm definitely gonna go see it let me
know what you think in the comments
below as well do you guys wanna see how
to achieve this 1940 inspired look which
is perfect for Christmas and the
holidays coming up then just keep on
watching
okay so I've already applied my
foundation and my concealer just to save
a little bit of time because you guys
have seen me do this a thousand times so
this was no point be showing it again so
I'm just going to skip straight through
to highlight and contour and today I'm
using the benefit blushing babe I'm
going to using the
LeBron's are from this that you can't on
my face not at the highlight I'm going
to be using at this makeup forever
highlight this is a shade pro light
fusion and this has been one of my
favorite highlighters recently it's just
so cool tone just really really nice and
glowy so I'm taking my makeup forever
brush and I'm just swirling that around
and then applying this to my cheekbone
this is a very little question but you
guys ever just sit in the light and just
observe your highlight in the mirror
because it looks majestic but that's
probably just needs a little wind so for
today's look we're going to be creating
a kind of a cut crease makeup look and
first of all I'm going to lay down a
base shadow which is going to be this
little concealer stick and this is
actually a CC ideal flawless concealer
stick from Avon you guys can use
whatever base you like you can use a
natural eyeshadow crayon if you have one
but this is what I have laying around
somebody's this but I'm just applying
that into the inner third of my eye I'm
not going to slightly blend this out
with my finger just so that the edges
aren't so harsh
I'm not taking up my seat makeup palette
this one is the Nordic Sky's palette and
I'm going to using at some of these cool
tone shades just here to add a little
bit of depth to the eye but first I'm
going to take is this by brown shadow
just here I'm going to be applying this
into the outer v of my eyes once that's
done I'm going to be taking the darker
Brown shadow which is a little bit more
cool toned I'm going to be applying this
even further into the crease but this
time I'm going to be using a slightly
more precise brush because we want to
start carving out the cut crease shape
with this
I'm not going to be returning back to my
concealer crayon and put this under them
to sharpen up the edges of my cut crease
and then then return back to my dark
brown shadow I'm going to use this to
build up on the depth and pigmentation
of the cut crease yes I'm going to take
a combination of these two light shadows
here which are like kind of champagne
shimmery shadows and I'm going to be
applying this into the inner corner of
our eyes so how my eye shadow is
finished I'm going to be skipping
straight to eyeliner and for this I'm
using my eye Copeland and eyeline and
this is in a felt-tip format so it's
great for easy application now I'm
mascara I'm gonna meeting at the Stila
one and this is called it the huge
extreme lash mascara so I'm going to
apply this over my top and bottom lashes
and I'm going to give this quite a
generous coat so now to finish off the
eyes I'm just going to be using it some
false lashes and the ones I'm using of
the ardell demi whispies so I'm just
going to go apply those and I'll be
right back that is the eyes complete
with the lashes on it and now to
complete the whole look I'm going to be
applying a signature cool toned forties
red lip the one I'm using today is the
melted matte and this is in shade lady
balls
and this is the finished look I really
love how timeless and classic the slugs
because obviously it's inspired by the
forties and I feel like makeup trends in
the forties just never died out everyone
will always love the red lip and kind of
like a smoky cut crease as well I also
think this look is perfect for the
winter holidays and for Christmas
especially this would be gorgeous on
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day I really
love this look and I hope you guys like
it as well if you guys enjoyed this
