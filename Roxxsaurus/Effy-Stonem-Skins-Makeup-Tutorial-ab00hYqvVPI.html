I saw your fire turned
so so I've already applied my foundation
just to save time and the one that I use
is really Mac Studio scopes and I use
this one because it's very bright and
fair and Fe skin is always very pale so
I decide to use this one to kind of pale
up my skin a little bit and to set it I
use the Rimmel stay matte powder so
first of all we're going to be starting
the brows Epis vials are always very
arched and they're kind of messy Psalms
like thick and mine up a little bit and
maintain the same arch that I always do
so I'm going to using the BT UK kit and
I'm using the darkest shade here and too
full of it I'm gonna be using this and
will brush by Mac
to prep my eyes for the eye makeup I'm
going to B's in this elf primer and I'm
just applying that one of the eyelid
front even base
the makeup we're going to be recreating
today basically focuses on accentuating
the crease and this is the makeup that
if he has in a scene Russian looks up
I'm not too sure which episode it was
but I'm pretty sure you guys will know
which one I'm talking about
and I'm just going to be using a
eyeliner like this and it's one of those
smudgy once so it's really easy to
smudge as the formula is cream and I'm
going to be outlining sort of the shape
of the cut crease makeup
now
so once you achieve this sort of shape
you can line your top flash as well but
try to be as close to the lashes as
possible
it doesn't matter if the whole thing is
messy because when you blend it out
anyway
so once you've got these weird tails on
your eyes you can go in with a small
fluffy brush and just blend it all out
once your top line is smudged you can go
in with the same eyeliner and just line
the whole of the bottom lash line and
waterline
now to get some brightness back to the
eyes I'm going to losing the slick
palette and I'm going to be using the
white color from this and third of you
who are wondering at the pilot is
chromed on a trail 6:01 and this is the
one I use a lot recently and as I said
I'm going to be taking a white shadow on
a fluffy brush and just popping that in
the center of my eye to just kind of
restore some dimension
then I'm just going to blend everything
together
I'm also going to be taking that same
shadow to highlight my brow bone
next I'm just gonna curl my lashes is in
the earth flash color
now to finish off my lashes amazing and
the benefit they're real mascara
to give my face a little bit of shape
I'm going to be using this earth
bronzing powder and I'm just going to be
loading and this one up on a elf blush
brush and it's this really nice dome
shape so it fits right in the cheekbone
in the reference picture Effie isn't
actually wearing a blush but her face
looks nicely naturally flushed so I'm
gonna reason this blush by Guerlain and
it's this sort of peachy color and I'm
just loading that up on my Real
Techniques blush brush and just applying
it to my cheeks
ah whoops always forgot the last step is
taking a bright blue kind of shimmery
shadow I'm taking one from sleep and
this is the original five line four and
I'm taking this really shimmery and
pigmented kind of neon blue I'm just
going to apply that in the inner half of
the lower lash line
these
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
