channel I hope you guys it'll well today
as you can tell I'm gonna be forming an
eyebrow DS and don'ts I think it's about
time for me to film this video as
promised I filmed the eye shadow decent
birds and I like to do those already so
I'll list them down in the description
and I'm also thinking about doing the
contour piece of notes let me know if
you guys would like to see that by the
way or do you like my shirt I know I'm
going to get loads of questions this is
from TK Maxx I think it's from a brand
called I've gotta say put Illustrated
people that's the brand and of course as
always it I am NOT here to tell you guys
how to do your eyebrows how to do your
makeup makeup is fun it's supposed to be
versatile everyone does it differently
so I'm not here to basically tell you
what to do by no means am I saying that
you can't do any of these things so yes
if you guys find this video helpful then
be sure to give it a big old thumbs up
and subscribe to this channel as well as
my blog channel while you're here I'm
not ready let's jump right into that was
a weird hair flip out from do let's jump
right into the video
so for the sake of this video this is
going to be my do side and this is going
to be my don't side and that brings me
to my first don't and that is striving
for a very solid color throughout the
whole of your brow when you observe your
brown naturally your grout doesn't have
a solid color all throughout the video
all throughout the video all throughout
the brow I do too much YouTube when you
look at your brow carefully you can see
that your brow doesn't have a solid
color or throughout it gets very thin
towards the beginning of your brow and
then it gets more dense and my eyebrows
do is to concentrate on the arch and at
the tail of your brow the most this is
where the product should be the darkest
and more dense so you can be a little
bit more heavy-handed in those areas of
your brows the next don't is pulling in
the trap of squaring off your brows I
see a lot of God's doing this they have
that really harsh line just at the
beginning of their brows if they look
good for photography mail and good for
videos but in real life it looks very
unnatural in my opinion and why I wanted
to avoid that from happening is to just
use a brow gel that is closest to your
eyebrow shade I just gently brush that
through the beginnings of your brows and
this will give your brows a much more
softer look while still giving you that
fullness towards the beginning if your
eyebrows are sparse so next I grab don't
is drawing a long and harsh line through
the brow as you can see your brows on
very angular they're not naturally like
a straight line and all perfect so my
eyebrow do is to basically draw very
short strokes to kind of replicate the
notion of your hairs and how they
naturally kind of look on your eyebrows
and this will just give it a much more
natural appearance
my next eyebrow Doge is dragging the
tail of your brow way too low I feel
like a lot of girls do this when they
try to kind of extend your brow a little
bit especially if you don't have many
hairs towards the tail of your brow this
just makes your whole eye look a little
bit droopy so you don't really want that
so the iPod do is to basically extend
your eyebrow outwards rather than
downwards so this gives you the fullness
that you are striving for but it just
doesn't make your eye droopy it just
makes them more elongated to the side
my next eyebrow don't is having your
eyebrows arch in the wrong place I'm not
actually seeing people do this quite a
lot throughout my school years I feel
like all of us when we're teens and kind
of don't know how to do what eyebrows
but we still try to so that is what I'm
here to help you guys if you are that
person that is just struggling I see
people arching the eyebrows way too
early on some people arched eyebrows
like halfway through the brow or like up
here and it's just really straightened
is not flattering
it doesn't frame the face to its best
potential so the eyebrow do is
definitely knowing where to arch your
brow and for this you just need a pen or
a makeup brush
basically you want to position it your
object on the side of your nose and this
is where your eyebrow should begin as
you can see now if you want to find
where your arch should be then just take
your object and align it at your nostril
and then directly through your pupil and
this is where your arch should be as you
can see and this is where - and then if
you want to know where your eyebrow
should end you just do the same thing
but this time you align it at the edge
of your eye and this is where your
eyebrow should end so that trick has
been around for years probably most of
you already know it but I just thought I
would include it in this video in case
you didn't when it's eyebrow don't is
using a brow product that is way too
dark for your brow this can really give
you that scouts brow so unless you're
going for that look I would suggest to
definitely match your eyebrow product as
close to your brow hairs as possible and
when next I bar do is to definitely use
two different shades if you feel like
your brows need it I often use a darker
shade to
arch and tell of my brow and then I used
something a little bit lighter towards
the beginning of my brow that much more
faded and natural look and my last don't
is over plucking your brows we've all
been there we've all over plucked
eyebrows in our teens and let me tell
you they don't grow back so if you are
young and you're thinking of plucking
your eyebrows definitely get your mum or
dad or someone that knows what they're
doing to do it for you or get it done at
professionals because life is too short
to be trying to grow out your brows
honestly it is a lot of hard work and
half the time your brows won't grow back
or they'll grow back in different
directions and they'll be very hard to
manage if you are desperate to do it
yourself then I have a do for you and
that is to actually fill in your brows
before you plug and that way you know
which brows are really important so you
can't touch them you can't pluck them
and you basically know which ones you
don't need and those are the ones you
can plug so that is all for all of my
eyebrows and oats I have it all wrote
down in my youtube notebook I've been
planning so many videos in this by the
way I am like obsessed so that is what
for this video I really hope you guys
