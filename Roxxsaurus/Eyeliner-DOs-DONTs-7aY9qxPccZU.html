channel I hope you guys a little bow
today as you can tell from the title I'm
going to be showing you guys some
eyeliner do's and don'ts I think
everyone here who wears eyeliner is
going to know the struggle of getting
one eye perfectly done and the other one
oh god that's another story you try your
hardest to match the two eyes and you
keep trying to boot up the line and you
end up making it so much thicker and now
that point there's just no going back
and you end up looking like a raccoon
also protein
don't let your boyfriend do your
eyeliner okay yeah
so before we jump straight in of course
makeup has no rules you do whatever
makes you happy I'm only showing these
tricks with you guys because they work
for me if you guys enjoy this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to this channel as well as my
blog channel if you're not subscribed
already
and I also post a link down below of the
previous do's and don'ts video I did
using eyeshadows but without further ado
let's just jump right into the video
so my first and don't is taking too much
I line up on your applicator and
applying it all at once
this can make your application a little
bit messy it's really hard to tone it
down and clean it up so what I wanna do
is definitely taking your time when
you're creating your liner if you're
using a gel liner make sure to take off
any excess product from your applicator
brush and slowly build up on the line
using very short strokes this will just
avoid your liner getting too thick too
quickly and you're going to be so much
more control on how your liner takes
shape now this next do's and don'ts are
specifically for hooded eyes having
hooded eyes needs that this part of your
eyelid naturally droops over your moving
part of your eyelid when your eyes are
relaxed there's different levels of
hitted eyes mine are very slightly
hooded so it just means that when I
relax my eyes you can see that this
section of the skin very slightly droops
over the edge of my lid so my eyeliners
don't for people of hooded eyes it's
creating a really thick liner especially
winged liner so what tends to happen is
when you
a winged liner it can become distorted
because of the way of the lid folds so
although it may look amazing when your
eyelid is closed as soon as you open
your eye and look forward it might look
a little bit weird and not so flattering
so my eyeliner do for people hooded eyes
is to keep the liner very thin
especially around this middle section of
your upper lash line and also avoiding
ring liner is definitely a good way to
avoid falling into this trap of
distorted liner and if you do have
hooded eyes and you still really love
the wind liner look try and keep your
liner as short as possible really try
avoiding applying any eyeliner anywhere
near the crease because as soon as it
touches the crease that is where it's
going to distort my next line that don't
is creating a really really long line up
I know sometimes we get carried away
with it and we want it to be as sharp as
a knife but sometimes I see people who
are applying that line that's so long
but if you carried it on just a
centimeter longer it could probably
touch the end of your eyebrow and this
is just my opinion but I think that's
really flattering it's also when you are
going for that eyeliner on fleek like
there to try and keep your liner and
moderate length I think it just looks
much more beautiful and subtle my next
eyeliner don't is pulling on your skin
whilst applying your eyeliner not only
it does the stretch out your skin and
create wrinkles but it also makes it
eyeliner application not accurate
because as soon as you let go of your
skin it's going to look completely
different so instead of pulling your eye
what you want to do if you're looking
into your mirror at eye level and keep
opening your eye to see how you line the
look so while your eyes are open
especially if you have hooded eyes it's
no use
tilting your head or even closing your
eyeballs applying eyeliner because once
you open your eye you could look
completely different the next eyeliner
don't is having your liner a really
sharp angle from your lash line although
some people like having a very angled
liner can give your eyes a really retro
feel however for most people it can look
a little strange so if you want your
liner to look much more
well-put-together
and like it belongs then trying a winged
liner positioned at the natural angle of
your lower lash line so all I always
should do is just basically link on and
carry on that line from your lower lash
line at the same angle my next don't is
applying liner through the crease if
your liner touches the crease it will
give you that strange kink in your
lineup and it won't look as
as you'd like it to be no of course my
eyeliner do is to avoid touching the
crease altogether and this will just
ensure that when you're looking straight
your liner will have a really nice
smooth and consistent line and the last
eyeliner don't is pulling your eyeliner
really close to the inner corner as well
as having the liner quite thick if you
have small eye or you have small lid
space what this can do is close up your
eye even further and the eyeliner do is
try to keep your liner on the outer
third over your eye without putting it
into the inner corner this is a style of
liner that I personally like to do on a
daily basis because I feel like it needs
you either peering quite open as opposed
to making it appear more closed so as
you can see I feel like this is much
better than this one it just looks much
more fresh this is of course the classic
style wave liner it's a full blown wing
which starts in the corner of your eye
and for someone with my eye shape I feel
like it's not too flattering really
brings attention to how small your lid
space is because there's a really strong
and thick liner going throughout the
whole of the lash line so remember that
your winged liner is there to complement
your shadow rather than hiding it
especially if you have a small lid space
like me so that's all for my eyeliner
