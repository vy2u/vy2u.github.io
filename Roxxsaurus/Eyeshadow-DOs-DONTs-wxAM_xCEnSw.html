guys are all well today I've got a
slightly different video for you guys
today I'm going to be for me the
eyeshadow do's and don'ts
I have never filmed a video like this
before so please bear with me I have
seen quite a few people do this on
YouTube and I thought I would just
create my own version and put my own
spin on it and share some tips and
tricks with you guys that some other
people might have missed so by no means
on my taking credit for this video I
have not come up with this video idea by
myself but I hope you guys still enjoy
it and find it helpful definitely don't
forget to leave me a thumbs up and
subscribe if you're not already because
I'd love to have you guys here and if
you would like to catch up with me on
any of my social media my Twitter
Instagram and snapchat are all rocks
auras same way it's about here but
without further ado let's jump right
into the video so starting off of the
very basics of eyeshadow makeup you
cannot forget a primer you and your
eyelid probe are going to be the best of
friends especially when you're creating
really heavy eye makeup looks using a
primer just gives your eyeshadows to
really cling onto something rather than
just swiping over your bare skin and
then of course I shadow do is using a
primer because like I said it's just
going to step up your eyeshadow game
big-time my next eyes shadow don't is
actually applying a regular eyeshadow
that you want to go with for that day
directly on to the primer and this is
because sometimes when you apply a dark
shade of eyeshadow directly onto the
primer when you brush first comes in
contact with your skin it can actually
leave a massive block of powder in that
place right there and that is because
it's really wanting to cling into the
wet primer and this in turn can actually
make your eyeshadow much harder to blend
out I shadow do is to actually place a
base shadow over your lid after you put
on your primer and something I would
personally use for this is something
very close to your natural skin tone or
maybe even a shade lighter and then you
can just simply use any shadow to go on
top of your base shadow and it's just
going to make the whole blending process
much much easier
my next eyes shadow don't is placing a
really dark riche addo directly onto
your eye first thing if you really want
to go for that really seamless blend and
you really need to use a try
in shadow no matter how blendable the
dark shadow that you're using is going
to be it's never going to give you that
perfect blend and that nice fade out
effect without that middle transition
shadow so for example if I was to go
with the shadow whiskey into my crease
I would firstly place down the shadow
combust and then blend whiskey into
combust and that's just going to make
your life so much easier because it's
going to be really easy to blend out my
next I shadow don't is actually applying
your foundation before you do your eye
makeup and then I'm guilty of doing this
the wrong way around but you really
should be using your foundation after
you've done your eye makeup because if
your shadows tend to create a lot of
fallout you're just ruining your perfect
base and you're more than likely going
to have to come back to your eye area
and fix it up next I shadow don't links
to my previous one and that is to not
apply concealer directly on to the
fallout so just create a really muddy
effect when your foundation or you can
see a lot so you want to actually dust
off all the fallout first and then apply
your foundation next eyeshadow don't is
using shimmery shadows into the crease
just my preference so if you do that
then that's totally fine if you like the
look of that but but personally I feel
like it looks quite unnatural and when
you're putting a darker shadow into your
crease most of the time you want it to
look deeper so you want it to look quite
natural and for this I would use a matte
shadow instead of a shimmer shadow
another eye shadow don't is actually
blending your eye shadow too far up into
your brow bone I feel like a lot of
people can get away with this if you
have a big lid space and your eyebrow is
quite high up for those of us who have
quite small in space and not that much
space between your eye and your eyebrow
it's really important to not blend your
shadow too high up because you might end
up looking like Elsa from Little Mermaid
and who wants that it would be awkward
if some people didn't want them for my
next eyes shadow don't is my rule of
thumb when you have deep set eyes which
means your eyes are quite wide apart and
they're not close to your nose you
shouldn't really be placing your
eyeshadow on the outer corners so much
that it elongates them even further so
when you're creating a smoky eye or any
eye shadow type that you like try to
keep your eyes are quite short and only
up to the point where I end and do not
extend it further if you have closer
Eisley I sure don't is to put dark
shadow right here in the inner part of
your eye
instead you should try to keep all of
the dark pigment on
outer corners and now just create the
illusion of your eyes being much wider
apart now my next eyes shadow don't is
not smoking out your lower lashline it
just says you do with your top lash line
when you're creating a smoky eye you
tend to use a crease shadow a transition
shadow and a lid shadow so for the lower
lash line it's no different when you're
placing down your dark shadow you also
want to smoke it out with that
transition shadow that you've used in
your crease and the last point I'll be
making in this video is about shadow
brushes I think it's really important to
know which ones you should be using for
what part of your eye shadow routine so
my eye shadow don't is applying your
really pigmented shadow like your lid
shadow with a fluffy brush as soon as
you pick up some shadow with this brush
it's just going to fly everywhere as
soon as you try and kind of work it into
your lid so for really pigmented shadows
for your lid you should be using a brush
that looks like this and this is a
shader brush also known as a flat brush
so when you apply shadows with this
brush you want to Pat it on rather than
swiping it about that is all for my
video I hope you guys enjoyed this I
have lots of fun making this videos if
