channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far so in today's video
and guess what i'm trying out I am
trying out Fenty beauty by Rihanna and
I'm so excited I've seen this video been
done by every youtuber every beauty guru
out there that I'm subscribed to and I'm
a little bit late on the bandwagon but I
quite film this video for you guys
anyways I have literally been staring at
these products in my beauty and I'm
vanity draw for the past few days I
should receive them a few days ago if
you guys follow my daily going channel
you already know that yeah I've just
been so eager to try them and I now
finally get to try the which I'm so
excited for if you guys are brand new
here and you have never seen this face
before hi I'm Roxy and welcome to my
channel please subscribe come and join
the dinosaur family we have so much fun
around here and if you enjoyed this
video make sure you smash that you
thumbs up just down below so I know
about that renew let's get on into the
video okay so here are my fancy BT
product
now I haven't had a look inside other
packaging or anything all I can see is
the boxes which are actually pretty cool
I picked up a total of five products to
test out I didn't get the whole range or
anything crazy because it is quite
pricey I have to say the products are
quite pricey so first up of course are
gonna test out the fancy BT Pro a filter
retouch primer and now this is just
beautiful the packaging is amazing this
is in shade soft matte I think they only
do one shade I mean it's a primer why
would they do more than one shade for
the packaging is actually the thing that
I love the most about Fancy beauty it's
just so sleek and just like pop it I
mean it kind of reminds me for the Kim K
packaging cuz it's like so nude and like
sleep so I'm just gonna pump one pump
onto my hand and just use the time
forever because we don't want too much
and oh because this is here's quite cool
it's not like silicone II but it's a bit
more like cream life like a moisturizer
which is nice by the way I am right
behind the tiniest bit of concealer just
under my eyes because I haven't had any
sleep recently I've been trying to sell
my house and it's just like most
stressful thing ever you guys should
totally keep up with the vlogs if you
want to know what's going on
but yeah it's just a nightmare anyways
that's why I'm wearing a little bit of
concealer just under my eyes the rest of
my face is absolutely bad so far I'm
quite feeling this primer it doesn't
feel too heavy on the skin and it just
feels like a moisturizer doesn't really
make my face feel soft my favorite
primer is the Weis our bulla primer
the touchet o'clock one and honestly
when I feel my face it just feels so
smooth and like Paula's I wouldn't say
this gives me that kind of feeling it
just feels a bit more moisturizing which
I still kind of like I'm gonna move
straight to foundation now so I have the
pro filter soft matte lock by foundation
in shade won 4-0 now I feel like this is
quite a close match to my skin but I'll
it should just match myself on the
website and I have no idea if I did a
good job so please excuse if this is not
the right shade I won't be judging it on
that that would just be my mistake
literally so this is the product the
packaging is pretty sleek and I really
like here um so it says shake well on
the bottle so I'm just gonna go right
ahead and shake it shake shake it shake
it shake it
I'm sorry oh no it's quite light in
color I feel like it might be a bit too
white for me we'll see we'll see okay so
I'm just gonna tap it on oh my god no no
I got the wrong shade because this
foundation is quite pricey it was like
30 pounds I think or how all the prices
like on screen as I'm talking about them
let's just hope to god that it's gonna
look a lot better when it's bonded in
because at the moment it totally does
not look like my shade okay here we go
with my huge Beauty Blender yep it's
gonna be too light I think I really
really like it so far it's quite good in
coverage obviously you can build it up I
feel like it's kind of oxidizing a
little bit and it's making it looked a
little bit more like my actual skin tone
okay so I blended it all in and I have
to say I think it's oxidized quite a lot
it now kind of matches my neck it hasn't
it looks a lot different to what I look
like on camera I feel like this is
actually a lot better than some of the
foundations I've used as a recent like
high-end foundations so I definitely
would
there's a huge thumbs up like she did a
really good job with it I'm now going to
be going to testing the fancy Beauty
matchstick trio which is that like a
bespoke little kit that I made myself I
picked all the different shades to suit
my skin tone because you can actually
choose there's like boxes ready-made
that you can pick from but you can also
make your own
I picked a concealer contour and
highlight which is in shade linen amber
and star stripe if you're wondering so
this is the product and what it looks
like
although I love the fact that these
products are magnetized so you can like
have a minute set I finally feel like if
I had this in my makeup bag then that
mean it isn't strong enough to keep it
all together it would just fall apart
but the idea is cool to be fair I'm just
going to go ahead and grab the concealer
in shade linen and I'm just gonna apply
that under my eyes so this is the
product and what it looks like insides
how much of the product you get which I
feel like is quite a lot considering the
Kim Kardashian beauty has such a tiny
amount of the product inside the
concealers and you know the contour
sticks so I feel like she did quite well
also these won't break off because
they're quite thick so I feel like
that's a really good move that she did
that so I'm just gonna go ahead and
apply this onto my under eye and you
know see how it goes I don't know if I
like it I have to say I feel like it's
quite creamy but at the same time the
stick is quite stiff does that make any
sense like it's just I don't know how
how well it will blend out but we will
see the coverage is actually quite good
though okay so I've done a bit of
highlighting slash concealing with this
product so really want to see how it
works
you're gonna buff this out with a big
buffer brush and okay so far it's
blending out quite well I'm really not
sure how I feel about this eye I have to
say I mean it kind of feels like I've
taken all the product off of my skin and
there's nothing there anymore okay so
I'm blending it all out now and I guess
it's okay like I'm not a huge fan of the
concealer in my opinion is just a bit
drying it's picked up a lot of my pores
and like imperfections especially under
my eyes its creasing quite a lot already
has it really covered up my under-eye
circles probably not and if you guys can
see that on camera but I can definitely
still see my under eye circles peeping
through so I don't know I don't know if
I'd buy a concealer stick from 20 Beauty
again but let's move right along onto
the contour stick so this is in shade
amber this is actually really cool toned
which I have high hopes for so the
consistency of the stick is the same
kind of consistency as the concealer I
said to be a very delicate area of your
skin so you know it's it's gonna hurt a
little bit when you're applying this
under your eyes but for the rest of the
face it's it's a lot better and bit more
bearable so this is what the contour
looks like it's very cool time so I'm
now just gonna blend all of this out and
see how it looks it blends out super
well oh my goodness that actually looks
really pretty what do you guys think do
you guys think that that looks muddy or
does it look good okay so contour stick
I cannot fault I absolutely love it
especially the perfect shade like I love
the fact that it's so cool toned it
looks super natural doesn't even look
like makeup which is exactly what we're
going for when we apply makeup we
obviously don't want it to look too fake
and lastly from the trio range we have
the highlighter this is in shade
starstruck so I'm just going to go ahead
and pop this onto my cheekbone and yes I
will like here oh my god that is so
pretty guys damn oh damn that highlight
tho that is so pretty and that is the
highlighter complete isn't blinding oh
wow
I absolutely love it it's so good I love
how pigmented it is it's very easy to
apply and blend out yeah overall I
really like it big fan but I have to say
there are products out there that do
exactly the same thing like I know they
have
some barium sticks in the drugstore and
they look exactly like this so I'm kind
of a bit like is this really why there
it's obviously beautiful but you can
definitely get cheaper that does pretty
much the same thing now moving on it to
the blush this is a little shimmer stick
so you could use this to the highlight
or a blush and this is in shader
tripping and I've never really use the
shimmery blush so we shall see how it's
gonna learn so I'm just going to go
right ahead and apply this to my
cheekbones whoo I love that oh my god
that's so pretty you guys see that color
this is gonna make my skin look so like
fresh and healthy and again this blush
is like a highlight to sort this so it's
given me even more highlighting goodness
oh my god I am obsessed like I just I
can't I I am lost for words that Leisha
the perfect like orangey kind of color
if you like that kind of thing
definitely would recommend this and the
last product we have all been waiting
for is the kilowatt highlighter by Fenty
Beatty oh my god I'm so excited to try
this I've seen photos with it everywhere
and it's absolutely beautiful is
initially a bright gold brick of
highlight which you just go okay okay
I'm not ready for this open it oh no oh
my god it's like dripping Agoura it's
smashed guys why does this happen to me
oh boy just fell out there but it was
like the little seal oh my god that gave
me a heart attack
why only me seriously only me I've been
waiting for this highlight been waiting
it then sing in my drawer and smashed
this whole time I can't even believe it
here I go I guess it's uh it's not as
exciting now that it's smashed but oh
whoa oh my god okay I'm excited again
so pigmented oh my god Rihanna you ain't
playing around girl I don't know why I'm
putting on an American accent but when
you say that sentence like you just have
to say an American accent goodness
Christ guys literally made out of a
brick of gold unless I kind of grabbed a
brick of gold smear it on my face and
this is the outcome I really like it
when you only use in the tiniest bit
because let's be honest that's just
ridiculous I'm gonna try and blend it
out with the beauty blender a little bit
but I don't think this highlight can be
tamed oh my god
it's literally like no it's like stuck
it's staying there now so this is my
final look I absolutely love the
products I have to say I mean they are a
little bit on the pricey side I have the
total that I paid for all of these
products and let's be honest it is very
pricy for just like five products but I
think that it's actually worth their I'm
gonna say like if you are into buying
celebrity products like Kim Kardashian
and Kylie Jenner that kind of stuff I
definitely would spend your money on
this rather than on like the Kardashian
beauty products that's just my personal
opinion because I feel like you actually
get your money's worth out of these
products because look at that like
that's so pigmented and then the 40 like
plus shades of foundation like come on
