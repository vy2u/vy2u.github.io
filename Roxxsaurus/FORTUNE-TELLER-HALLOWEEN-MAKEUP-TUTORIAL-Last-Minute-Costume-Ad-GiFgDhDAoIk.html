today I have at this fortune-teller
makeup tutorial I absolutely love this
look and I feel like it's really
wearable for those of you who don't want
to go all out and wear like face paint
all over their face this is really easy
to achieve with probably all the makeup
you already own anyways and I feel like
it will be a great last-minute costume
so in this video I'm gonna be using some
Maybelline products to create this look
which is perfect because it's all
drugstore and very affordable if you
guys enjoyed this video make sure you
smash that his thumbs up just down below
and make sure you check out all of my
other Halloween tutorials that I've done
this year I'll have a whole playlist in
the little I in the corners and make
sure you guys check them out after this
video but without further ado let's get
on into the tutorial so I'm starting off
this look with my base already finished
so I'm moving straight ahead to
contouring so for this I'm gonna be
using the master bronze color and
highlighting palette and taking the
third shade from this palette I'm gonna
be popping that into the hollows of my
cheeks and also my temples and forehead
and then taking a small blending brush
and also contouring my nose with this
this is going to give the appearance of
a much slender and pointed nose and then
moving on to highlight and I'm just
popping at the highlight onto the tops
of my cheekbones my nose and also my
inner corners once your skin is bronzed
and glowing we're gonna be moving on to
the eyes so for this I'm gonna be using
the burgundy bar palette and taking the
brown shade here I'm gonna be popping
this into the crease as a nice
transition color for all of the other
eyeshadows that we're gonna apply later
on next up I'm taking the burgundy
shimmering shadow from this palette and
I'm just gonna be popping that further
into the crease and really just building
up that pigmen I'm also pulling that red
eyeshadow onto the very bottom of my
lash line as well
the next shadow I'm going to take is
this gorgeous purple one and I'm just
going to pop that on my lower lash line
on both eyes I'm then taking the copper
shade which is next to the burgundy
shadow and I'm just going
use a packing brush to pop this onto all
of mine lid I absolutely love this
shadow it really complements the red and
also it makes my blue eyes really pop
next up I'm gonna take this a shimmering
champagne shadow and I'm just gonna pop
that in the very center of my lid and
kind of diffuse that with my finger into
the inner corner and outer corner and
lastly for the eye shadow I'm going to
be taking to this dark matte Brown
shadow and I'm going to pop this into
the outer crease of my eye to add some
depth to the look and also run this
along the lower lash line now reaching
for the metallic Matt Inc liners these
are absolutely gorgeous I'm just
basically going to use this to create
these little triangles underneath my
eyes almost like a teardrop effect and
then taking the shimmering gold shadow
and I'm just popping that over the liner
to add extra sparkle and lastly I'm
gonna return back to the ink liner and
just add little dots to the very ends of
the points just for a little bit of
detail moving on I'm gonna line my eyes
with the master precise liquid eyeliner
and I'm just creating my very typical
winged liner with this on both eyes
I'm then returning back to the tear
drops and I'm just popping over some red
eyeshadow from the burgundy bar palette
now to finish off the eyes I'm going to
be using the Big Shot mascara and I'm
just popping a few layers of that on my
top and bottom lashes
for the lips today I'm going to be using
the super stained matte ink liquid
lipstick and this isn't shade escapists
so I'm just going to be applying that to
the whole of my lip and this is really
easy to use even without a lip liner
because the applicator is so precise
that you don't even need one I'm then
going to be using the metallic foil
lipstick and I'm just gonna be applying
a very small ring it to the bottom lip
this is going to add just a bit of
accent and pop of color to the dark
lipstick now moving on to the third eye
on my forehead I'm going to be using the
precise micro pencil in shade blonde
just outlined the eye on my forehead I'm
then taking a matte Brown shadow from
the burgundy bar palette and I'm just
going to be shading the eye just a
little bit to make it more 3-dimensional
you wanna focus on making the crease
look as three-dimensional as possible as
this will really make the eye it's so
much more realistic and then taking a
black eyeliner and I'm just creating at
the top and bottom lashline and also
emphasizing in the actual crease and
then I'm also going to be adding some
lashes to the eye now lastly to fill in
the eye I'm going to be using a white
matte ink eyeliner and with this I'm
just literally filling all of the inside
of the eye and then returning back to
some of that shadow that I have left
over on my brush it just a shade the
very top of the eye and this is the
finished leg
so this is the finished look oh my god I
love it so much I think it's really like
wearable I have a full list of all the
products that I used in this video in
