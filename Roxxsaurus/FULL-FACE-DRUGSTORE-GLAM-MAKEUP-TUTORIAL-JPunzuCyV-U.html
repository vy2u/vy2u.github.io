hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys are doing a
super well so today I'm going to be
filming at this really nice warm toned
makeup look which is really festive and
perfect for Christmas and is Eve so
everything that you guys see on my face
right now is from the drugstore which
makes it really affordable and really
accessible for everyone you guys like
this makeup make sure you smash that
huge thumbs up just down below and also
subscribe if you are brand new well
without further ado let's get into the
video so I've already applied my
foundation and my eyebrows I'll have a
list of the products I use down below so
starting off with contour I'm going to
use my NYX contour palette and I'm
taking that on a big fluffy brush and
I'm just basically applying that to the
usual places like my cheekbones my
temples and also contouring my nose with
this a little bit as well and this will
just add that definition and warmth to
my face
moving on to highlighting I'm going to
use my L'Oreal Paris True Match
highlighter this combination of shades
is just perfection it's so cool toned
which I love so I'm just applying that
to my cheekbones my nose and also my
Cupid's bow moving on to the eyes I'm
going to use my NYX ultimate shadow
palette and firstly I'm taking this
really nice warm toned shadow and I'm
just basically popping this into my
crease as a nice transition shadow which
we can build on top of I'm then reaching
for a slightly darker brown shadow and
I'm applying this even farther into the
crease to define it even more and make
it look like our crease is much more
defined than it really is you then also
want to pull that into your lower lash
line to tie it all together I'm now
taking this red tone shadow and I'm just
really lightly sweeping that through the
crease to add a little bit more warmth
to the shadows and this is a really nice
way to make red eye shadow wearable up
next I'm taking my master strobing
liquid from Maybelline and I'm actually
going to double this product as an
eyeshadow primer because the color is
just so beautiful so then I'm taking
this really nice coopera shimmery shadow
which I'm going to place on top of and
the strobing liquid underneath just
gives that extra shimmer and makes it
stand out even more I'm then taking this
light champagne color and I'm just going
to pop that in my inner tear-duct now to
line my eyes I'm going to use the
bodyshop skinny thin felt tip liner now
this is such an easy eyeliner to use I
reach for this one pretty much every
single day and it's just so quick really
precise and it's really matte black so
that's why I love about
it's I'm just creating a winged liner
with this now moving on to mascara I'm
going to use the falsies that push-up
drama from Maybelline this is a really
affordable mascara but I feel like it
does do a really good job of making my
lashes long so I'm just applying that to
my top and bottom lashes I am also going
to apply some falsies on top these ones
are the ones I've used and to finish off
the look we can move on to the lipstick
and I'm going to be using this red one
by Maybelline it's such a pretty classic
red color I love it so much and this is
the finished look complete so that was a
light festive makeup load I really hope
you guys enjoyed it I'm actually really
diggin this makeup look it's something a
little bit more out of my comfort zone
that's a little bit more dramatic than
what I usually wear but I'm really
liking out I think the festive season in
a great time to start experimenting with
makeup and just kind of go out of your
comfort zone a little bit and try
something new so if you guys enjoyed
this video make sure you smash that huge
thumbs up just down below and also
subscribe I would love to have you here
as well for me I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I'll see you
very soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
