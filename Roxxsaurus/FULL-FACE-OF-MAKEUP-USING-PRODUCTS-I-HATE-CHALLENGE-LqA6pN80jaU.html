channel I hope you guys have an awesome
day so far so today I'm starting off the
video with absolutely no makeup and for
once I'm going to be doing a video about
things that I dislike I always show you
guys the products that I've been loving
and all the products I ever used in my
makeup toriel that always was that I've
been tested out and I swear by them so
today I thought I would do something
it's a lady bit different and do my full
face of makeup using products I really
don't like but Before we jump straight
in I've something they don't know that
I'm holding a prymaat giveaway the 50
pound this gift voucher for the shop and
today is a large trust and so I'll let
you guys know the exact date down below
so make sure you guys are entered all
you have to do is just be subscribed so
you guys enjoy this message most he
thumbs up and let's get into the video
the first time I'm going to start off
with foundation now this product is a
product that I really wanted to try and
I thought would be amazing but I just
didn't seem to get along with it the
product I'm talking about is the makeup
forever water blended foundation I'm
sure most of you guys are familiar with
this product I love makeup forever like
the brand is amazing I really like some
of their products however this one I
just could not get along with for some
reason isn't the kind of consistency it
is it's very runny very watery when you
kind of blend it into the skin it
doesn't really do anything it's very
lightweight so perhaps it would be great
for someone with a really naturally
beautiful skin however I do need that
tiny bit of coverage for like any
discoloration on my face it doesn't
really blend very well into the skin it
kind of gives like streaky water marks
if that makes any sense
especially if you're using a brush so
for the price of this product I just
don't think I can justify spending this
kind of money on a product that doesn't
bury anything for my skin because it
consistency is so watery when you use a
brush it just kind of really absorbs it
into the brush and you get barely any
coverage with it to learn the last
deal-breaker of this product is the fact
that it costs around 37 pounds I'm not
too sure exactly so don't quote me on
that but I know it is more of a high-end
foundation so when you pay that kind of
amount of money you do expect something
a little bit more covering if you get
what I mean
prefer that pleasure lightweight
coverage with barely any coverage at all
I would definitely recommend more of a
BB cream from the drugstore because you
can get so much more for your money so
this is what my face looks like after
applying it two layers of the foundation
I can tell that old camera it probably
looks much better than it does in person
but I can definitely see some of my like
dark spots and any acne scars kind of
seeping through as long as any veins
that I kind of like to cover up the
foundation this is definitely down to
personal preference and I'm sure some of
you guys out there might like this
foundation but for me I just like that
tiny bit more coverage so for me this
foundation is a big no-no if the next
product I'm going to use is the anyway
probate prime and conceal now as you can
tell up from the packaging I have used
this quite a lot and I have definitely
had my fair share of testing the
products that I can raise how you might
true opinion then you can probably see
from the palette the shade that I give
the most is the green and the kind of
skin color shade and I still love this
palette before I tried any other kind of
correcting palette this was like when my
favorite go-to palette watch changed my
mind about this palette is when I tried
other correcting palette from the
drugstore and they were just so much
better and a kind of beginner palette I
wouldn't say this is like totally bad I
realize don't really like this palette
because the colors are just very not
skin like as you can see I'm applying
the lightest kind of skin tone color
under my eye and although it looks like
it's covering everything and although it
looks like it's getting rid of my
under-eye powerful I just think it's
making it look white and kind of ghostly
and another thing that I don't really
like about the cream product is the fact
that it creases so easily when you're
wearing this throughout the day you'll
find that you look like five years older
by the end of the day and when I use
this product I definitely have set it
with a powder in well this point under
seems to be really prone it to creasing
so I'll even do those definitely like to
lift it and highlight into my under eye
area but I just think it looks a little
bit too much if that makes sense also
going to apply this onto my lid to kind
of prime it for a shadow as well now add
a bit of color back into Wednesday
I'm going to use a blush that you guys
might not expect for me to say that I
don't like and it's basically this matte
blush and this is in shade super
continental it's a powder blush I'm sure
a lot of you guys are they're gonna be
like why like matt has amazing blushes
and don't anymore
I do like Matt Prado some are just
better than others I find that this one
here it just isn't that great there's
not really any color payoff although it
is quite a neutral color it kind of
sleeps off of your face halfway through
the day it's kind of a waste of time to
apply blush onto your feet if it's just
going to fly away for out the day but
you can see it's a very subtle blush
there's not that much color payoff to
this one so that is why it's probably
one of my least favorite blushes that I
own I'm now going to move on to the
brows and for this I'm going to be using
the urban decay brow betta I used to get
along with this product but I found that
it's right really super quickly I
absolutely love urban decay and love the
eyeshadow palette loved them bit
products but for me and this one was a
bit of a flop because it doesn't really
dry and when it right typically it just
doesn't even distribute any of the
products like Very Berry just tributes
the product onto my brow where it
becomes super stiff meaning that when
you're trying to apply it it kind of
hurt your skin it's almost like you're
trying to scratch your eyes out so
honestly it's not as creamy as I would
like it to be I get my day as a pencil
it's never going to be like a pomade for
example it is quite difficult to get a
super clean as this especially when
you've owned it for a few months and
it's kind of starting to dry out don't
mean is eyeshadow I found it really
difficult to try and find a palette that
I didn't really get along with because a
lot of the makeup I own I absolutely
love so when I was going through my
drawers I was trying to find the
products that were right at the back of
the drawer which I never use and
obviously I don't use them for a reason
one of the palettes that was at the back
of my drawer with this one and this is
from the brand pure or / I'm not too
sure which one you guys prefer inside
just a palette of eight shadows and I
thought these would be great I
absolutely love the colors they look
very similar to like the decay of
something I really like of the texture
of these eyeshadows in series think of
this is like the perfect little eye
shadows to take anywhere very quickly
after using this palette I just found
that that was way too much fallout I
really like the shimmer shadows in this
but the match lines are kind of chalky
which I don't really like my eye shadow
finish I acquiring the finish result but
there is just way too much full lava
I really have to kind of dust away
nothing is eyeliner as you guys know I
love my wings to be super clean cut as
sharp as a blade
I just can't achieve that with this
eyeliner here and this is the Kiko
Milano graphic gaze double eye marker so
I got this sent a while back and I use
it once and I never used it again purely
because it's got a tiny little ball on
the end and it can't seem to understand
why brands are making liners like this
and more and more can you tell me how
I'm meant to do my eyeline with this
little nip at the end so guys wish me
luck this whole look could just go down
the drain within a few seconds if I mess
this up so I've done the upper lash line
and now for the big finale let's try and
do the wedding oh my god this is so
difficult
I literally just can't can you guys can
you guys just look at this liner
what is it basically the Rose it is
nothing okay so my liner does not match
to save my life but this is the best
we're going to get honestly look at this
it's so streaky and not leaking that
room so to see this monstrosity the only
thing we can do is apply mascara oh wait
I don't like this mascara either and
mascara I'm using today is the
collection volume acts so this mascara
has two ends it's got a primer end which
in theory I should like based on the
brush I thought that this would be
amazing for my lashes I love is really
sick volumizing kind of mascara however
I was very mistaken didn't make them
look any longer or fake on actually just
nothing
I favor the scar to supply it onto the
lashes way too thin and you think that
this was horrible kind of apply a bit
thicker and the finish
I'm gonna go for a dark lick now this
isn't very spring-like but this is a
lipstick that I definitely do not like
one bit this is from a makeup revolution
and it's the salvation velvet lacquer
I'm not too sure if they still sell this
but they sold it a while ago my gosh
even in one pound so I was like yes I
can get that lipstick for one pound it
applies it really to move on to the lip
eyes look pretty crazy right now but
please and all that and so it might
release move on to the lips however it
dries super dry like super dry when it's
are literally going to be as dry as the
Sahara Desert for the next week or so
after applying this lipstick initially
just decide this like any inner part of
my mouth and already it's gone on my
teeth it really does not stick to the
mouth it does go straight on your teeth
so this is not a good look so this is
not a good look now that is starting to
dry a little bit the corners of my mouth
have started to stick together and it's
just a really unpleasant evening so I
definitely definitely don't like this
lipstick so this is the finished makeup
look I really don't like it really it
really though like a shadow isn't that
bad apart from the fallout which I had
to clear up earlier the eyeliner just
isn't sharp it's not bold it's just
everything I dislike in an eyeliner so
let me know down below what you guys
think of this makeup like I'm sure most
of you with me I know is not even that
bad but trust me it is this video
obviously you're trying to be negative
to any of these brands I absolutely love
at the brand like in general of course
no one is perfect and even brands are
going to have some products such as will
not work for some people and where these
products haven't worked for me
personally they might just work for you
let me know down below what correct you
guys decide or don't get along with kind
of nice to share these things because
everyone on uShip always just talked
about oh my love there's
I love this but no one ever says no this
hasn't really worked for me I wouldn't
recommend for you survive it and waste
your money on there so every enjoyed
