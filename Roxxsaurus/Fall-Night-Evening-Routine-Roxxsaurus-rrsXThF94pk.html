filming my night routine and I'm really
excited to film this video because I've
never done a video like this before so I
hope you guys enjoy it so when I get in
I usually head straight to my room and I
turn on the fairy lights around my bed
just to kind of set the mood a little
bit I love putting my fairy lights
because it just makes my room feel so
cozy and autumnal and just nice I then
head straight to the kitchen and
obviously I say hi to my cat I have
three cats and one dog so my house is
filled with pets I then go to boil the
kettle and my cat follows me around I
think you want some food I love having
teas in the autumn and winter because it
just warms you up straight away and I've
got this really cute sunflower mug from
TK Maxx I then go back into my room tidy
up a little bit and now it's time for
pizza and I really wish I could show you
guys me having a really healthy dinner
but that's never going to happen
so I'm ordering pizza I then go on my
laptop and I'm going to watch an episode
of American Horror Story it's one of my
favorite favorite series of all time but
I'm actually not too sure about hotel if
you guys do watch Hotel then let me know
what you think about it so far it's a
weird season but I'm still gonna watch
it because you know it's American Horror
Story
yay Pizza Man is here so I'm getting my
pizza as you can see I'm very excited
don't worry guys I don't eat all of this
by myself
let me know if this is a true
representation of yourself after you've
had dinner I always feel so bloated
because I eat too much I'm then heading
upstairs to kind of get my PJs get into
comfy clothes and yeah there's my dog
his name was Buster so I'm just going
into my dressing room to get changed
into some really really warm and cozy
PJ's and then I'm brushing my teeth this
was very very weird to film not gonna
lie now I'm back in my room and I'm just
gonna light some candles you know set
the mood set a romantic mood and I
really really love the Yankee Candles
I've got the Christmas set
to kind of relax and unwind in the
evenings I love playing on my Nintendo
3ds and the game I've recently started
playing is the new star boutique -
fashion-forward basically what this game
is about is the fashion world and
different career paths that you can
explore so basically you can manage your
own boutique and you have the complete
freedom to do so and in addition to that
there are other four professions that
you can unlock as you go along in the
game however in the game you can be
things like a makeup artist hair stylist
you can also be a designer or even a
model so here you can see I'm just
making my own character which is the
manager of the boutique and surprisingly
it really turned out very similar to me
which is really scary there are so many
items to choose from one top alone can
be worn in so many ways you get
customers coming to your boutique and
kind of asking for certain pieces of
clothing that they are looking for and
kind of have to fulfill the need for
example this one woman came in to my
boutique and she asked for a casual
dress so I go into my boutique and I
have a look at what casual dresses there
are and you kind of choose one for hand
and you can see her try it on and that
kind of thing and I just think it's
super super fun so if you guys want to
check it out you can actually download
the demo of the game for free on the
Nintendo 3ds eShop so yeah if you guys
are interested in this type of game then
check out the link down below in the
description because I love the game and
I'm sure you are too once I'm done
playing on my Nintendo 3ds I go over to
my vanity area to take off my makeup and
I use my simple wipes to do this I find
them really really good and they're so
soft and gentle so I've been using them
a lot recently
I then go to brush my hair because I
actually pluck my hair every night
before I get to bed because I like
having my hair out the way when I sleep
and also when I wake up I have amazing
waves to my hair and then going in with
my miracle Guardian
preme and i'm just applying that all
over my face and then I'm gonna have a
little snuggle with my sweetheart of a
kitten look at him he's growing up so
much I just want him to stay little
forever he's adorable
after that I just go on my phone text my
boyfriend kind of check my social media
reply to some of you guys and stuff like
that I love it when you guys socialize
with me on YouTube through comments and
stuff like that I read every single one
and I try to reply to as many as
possible so keep the comments come in
because I love messaging you guys so now
it's time for bed I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did definitely

you haven't already I love you all so so
much and I'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
