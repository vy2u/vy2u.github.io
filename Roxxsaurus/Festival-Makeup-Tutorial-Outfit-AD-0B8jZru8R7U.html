channel so it's that time the aunts
again and festival season that's coming
up and I've been invited to the Renault
Twingo access all areas music gig with
Katy be performing so this calls it for
a night out life festival makeup
tutorials I'm going to be creating at
this fun and bright makeup look so
without perfectly let's just jump right
into this video to see how I did this
look and at the end I'm going to be
showing you my outfit as well
so before starting this video I already
applied my foundation and my eyebrows
for my foundation I used the L'Oreal
infallible 24 hour foundation and the
eyebrows I just moved in with my grubby
- pencil by Urban Decay so now I'm going
to skip straight into some bronzer to
add a little bit of warmth to my face
and for this I'm using the Bahama Mama
bronzer by in the balm and as well is
really good because it's quite cool to
own just so it gives you that natural
kind of sunkissed who I rather than it
looking quite orange
and now the blush that I'm reaching for
this to peaceful a chance
such cute packaging it's receiving four
hearts and this this really nice orangey
and pinky blush which has a little bit
of shimmer to it I'm just gonna go ahead
and apply that on the apples of my
cheeks and to finish off the skin I see
after they've go in with a highlight to
add a little bit of glow to my face and
what I'm using is the seventeen instant
glow shimmer breeze I'm just gonna apply
that to the highest point of my cheeks
just to add a little bit more dimension
back into my face as well as a nice
healthy Yui glow so now that the star of
the show which are the eyes of course
I'm going to be using this Too Faced
chocolate bonbon palette and this is so
gorgeous
I created look with this on my Instagram
and a lot of you have requested for me
to do some looks with this palette so I
thought I would use it today but firstly
I'm going to profile it with the Urban
Decay primer potion this is the
anti-aging one so firstly from this
palette I'm gonna be using the shades
divinity which is this matte white
shadow
and I'm gonna place that will the lid
just as that diploma in place the next
generally be using is this one here
which is called almond truffle I'm going
to be placing that into the crease as a
transition shape
next I'm going to deepen up that crease
color with this shape here which is
called your mocha so I'm just taking it
on the same brush and just diffusing
that through the crease
and then I'm just going back and forth
and back and forth trying to blend all
the shades together and building up that
shadow marker in the outer corner so now
that we've got off that subtle depth
within our eyes I'm going to go in with
the shade Bordeaux which is like this
brown tube with a red undertone to it
and what we want to do is lightly blend
this through the crease as well but when
I say lightly I mean literally so
lightly because this is quite a dark
shade so you don't mess up your whole
look with this and this trailer is just
let's start adding that pink and red
undertone to the eyes I'm going to be
taking at the shadows sprinkles and also
crying candy which are the two pink
shades this one's slightly lighter than
this one and what we're going to be
doing is creating a slight gradient with
this so applying sprinkles into the
inner corner of our eye and then
gradually moving onto cotton candy
through the center of others so I'm just
really packing a lot of color because we
want the color payoff to be really
pigmented but also putting that slightly
into the inner corner then I'm moving on
to the shadow cozy and just passing that
into the center of our lid whilst
blending out whether the sprinkles
shadow
I'm not the bigger that it's you
Bordeaux and Monica and learning needs
two shadows together I've sort of touch
up the crease and burn of the pigment in
the outer corner as we may have lost
some bloomin tation whilst blending
everything together so now we've learned
that everything together I'm gonna go in
with this a pink shade called totally
fetch I know so Mean Girls right stop
trying to make fetch happen it's not
gonna happen I freaking love me your
house so with this shadow I'm going to
be going into the crease just to add
that hint of pink color running through
the crease and I'm trying to focus this
on the outer corner of my crease as well
as the outer corner of our lids I'm not
taking it into this inner corner at all
I'm not going to be lining on my
waterline as well as my goal actually if
this blue makeup proba eyeliner to add a
pop of blue to our lower lash line so
I'm not going to clean up the edges of
my eyeshadow with a makeup remover I'm
not gonna line my eyes at with the oven
decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in shade
perversion gotta finish up the eyeliner
in creating a wing with this Maybelline
New York gel liner
Malcolm I'm ashes I'm gonna be using the
makeup forever excessive lash mascara
just to prep my lashes for the fake
lashes that are going to go over the top
enough for lashes I'm going to be think
these are Devils natural a demi whispies
a lastly for the lip I'm going to
combine this lip liner from gosh in
shade antique rose with this urban decay
lipstick in shade native so this is the
final work
I actually really like how it turned out
it's not something I would usually wear
but I think it's really pretty and girly
and now I'm moving on to the outfit my
jacket top and bag out from Urban
Outfitters and my jeans are from bdg and
lastly for the shoes I went with some
Doc Martens because I feel like you
can't go wrong by wearing Doc's to a
festival
and that is all for this video I hope
you guys liked it massive thanks to
Renault Twingo for inviting me to this
festival as well as lending me that
gorgeous car
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you very soon in my next one
