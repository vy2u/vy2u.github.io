this makeup look it's like a winter
morning sort of frosty makeup look just
just words I hope you guys enjoy it
and let's just jump right in first I'm
going to apply my foundation which it is
Max Factor ageless elixir which looks
like this and this has SPF 15 so that's
great for winter and I'm just gonna
kinda like my dark circles or any
problematic areas to get a flawless face
next I'm going to use my east aileron
concealer and this is looks like this I
don't really know what the name is or
anything like that but yeah I've really
good anothers concealer it's amazing for
under-eye circles it like instantly gets
rid of any darkness so that's great
especially for those cold winter
mornings when you just rolled out of bed
and you're really tired and you look
like a zombie which I do every day
basically so this is perfect for my life
next we're gonna settle that with my
benefit powder flage this powder is
amazing is a loose powder so is a little
bit like you know not very practical
especially for traveling but if you're
at home that it's perfect
and what I'm using is this angled Mac
brush I don't even know what one this is
because it's been ages it's been a while
basically I'm just applying that
underneath my eyes to set the concealer
and foundation and what I love about
this powder is that it has like a little
bit of a pink undertone to it and when
you apply it you can't see it but it
does something weird and it basically
makes your skin that already flawless
and airbrush I'm actually gonna work
backwards and just work on my face fast
so I'm gonna actually contour now and
the bronzer that
use its the bourgeois one I absolutely
love this I'm really late on the
bandwagon but I yeah it's just a really
amazing it's like chocolate I'm just
gonna apply that with a Bobby Brown
brush I don't know again what it's
rubbed off but yeah just in my cheekbone
to you know give my face a bit more
definition next is highlighter and
highlight I'm using is dual I've had
this for some time but I completely
forgot about it and looks like this
least we love it all the time and yeah I
just rediscovered it so I'm using that
same brush that I used the powder ring
and I'm just applying that on my
cheekbone the blush and the knees my
Bobbi Brown blush this is in peony
that's what it's called it's this one
East have a bronzer resolve that yeah
it's fallen out so it's just the blush
now and I really really love this it's
like an icy Barbie sort of pink and I'm
applying that with a real techniques
brush so I'm just applying that on the
apple of my cheek to give my face like a
frosty look like I'm freezing which
apparently is something that I like the
look off looking freely okay let's go
with it if you add a little bit on the
nose as well it's gonna look like you're
freezing which is kind of cute I think
my shadow choice of today is Maybelline
eye studio this is like a little eye duo
and this is in 60 bronze subduction and
I really love these - they're like
shimmery shadow is really nice for
ultimate winter I'm just going to use
the lighter shade as a wash all over the
lid with a big fluffy brush I'm just
applying that all over the lid
please ignore my brow game today it's
not on point I just don't know what
happened I need to work on the little
bit more and then I'm going to take the
darker shadow which is this one and I'm
going to apply that in the crease we're
gonna create like a little smokey look
it's not like in your face it's very
subtle I really really love this combo
of like gold and then brown on the outer
corner cuz it's really like I don't know
I think gold just looks good with any
sort of skin color and it's really
festive as well I'm gonna pour that
underneath as well
come on this face though why do girls do
this base with a filmmaker I do the
eyeliner I know in the morning is so so
avoiding to apply eyeliner because your
eyes are like coming out of your face he
was so tired and you just have to sit
there and apply eyeliner it's really
really tedious and I hate doing it so
sometimes I take a short route and I use
a brown eyeliner into the black and it's
just so much easier you can smudge it in
it looks effortless and I don't know
it's just find that it looks much more
natural so what I use is this little bad
boy by number 7 this is in 10 brown I
used to use this when I had like a
stubby little pencil cuz I've used it so
much so I got a new one and yeah I'm
just going to line my like all around my
eye don't pull it into the corner
because in the morning when you're
looking tired and you apply eyeliner in
the corner of your eye is gonna make
your eyes look even smaller and you're
gonna look even more tired so make sure
you keep the inner part of your eye open
I'm just gonna sort of like the line my
waterline maybe extend it a little bit
even go on the top lashline and then
what I love about this is that it's got
a little smudgy thing on the end
so it's really stupid easy to just blend
it all out it's really really quick so
you don't need like different tools to
do this and it's way too good on the go
as well what'd you guys think I think
it's pretty good and it took me like two
seconds now the mascara I'm gonna use
this one some of you said that this was
Maybelline um I really don't know
because as you can see it's all rubbed
off completely so I'm just gonna say
it's a Maybelline look I'm going to use
this to cut my lashes and I really like
this mascara because it makes my lashes
really long and my lashes are basically
non-existent so that's a plus from any
mascara
can you see that look at this look at
this it's like nothing there's nothing
here as always I'm getting mascara with
my hair
such a pro I've decided I'm going to pop
in some high light interior in a corner
and one when the use of this is the
cleany touch tint for eyes this is in
shade shimmer frost it's a perfect
because frosty winter look so it's got a
little chippy thing like this but I'm
just gonna sort of like squirt it on my
finger and apply it it's really strange
so just take it on your finger like that
and sort of apply it in your inner
corner and then you can blend it out
with a brush now for lips I'm going to
use a rim or lipstick this is in 0:06
pink blush I really really love this
it's like a matte think it's really
really nice I don't usually use pinks um
but I'm gonna give it a go so I'm just
going to slightly dab it on don't want
it to look too sort of like you know
fake I want it to look very natural
still so this is the final look I hope
you guys like here I really really like
it I think it's very like subtle and
really easy to do very quick nothing
like out of the ordinary your very basic
and I really like the combination of the
golds and the Pink's I think it's very
pretty for winter as always I hope you
