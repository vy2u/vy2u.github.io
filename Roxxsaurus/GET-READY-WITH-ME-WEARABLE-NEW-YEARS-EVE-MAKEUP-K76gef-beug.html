the L'Oreal infallible 24 hour mapped
foundation I've already applied this on
my skin just to save a little bit of
time and the brush that I used to apply
this is the Real Techniques foundation
brush
now I know that this make of the story
is or drugstore but I've got one
exception and that's the Mac Studio Fix
powder I've really been loving this
powder at the moment so I thought I
would just include it in this video
of course you can opt for something more
affordable like the Rimmel stay matte
powder I just really really like this
one because it really minimizes your
pores and gives you like the flawless
airbrushed kind of skin I actually
haven't got a drugstore bronzer as I've
run out so I'm gonna be using my trusty
and UA eyebrow powder and you guys are
probably gonna think I'm crazy but these
two shades are like the best kind of
contour shade so I just kind of swap my
brush in the two shades tap the excess
off and just kind of contour with this
because these shadows are essentially
cool toned this works really great for
contouring as it doesn't give you that
yellow and orange II kind of tone to
your face so I'm just applying that just
over my cheek bone trying to kind of
lift my cheekbone a little bit and as
I'm contouring my cheek I'm kind of
swinging my brush up with like this and
that's just gonna give you like a really
nice sculpted cheek I'm also gonna
contour my forehead a little bit just in
the corners
but black-tie movies in today is the
sleek cream blush and this is in shade
front row zero seven eight it's just
this really nice natural kind of your
cheeks but better shade so I'm going to
just sweating my finger in there as this
is a cream blush but I'm just kind of
popping that onto my cheek and then just
blending you out of my hand the
highlighter that I'm going to be using
today is also from sleek makeup and this
is called highlighting palette in
solstice I think I'm saying that right
eye looks like Grace look at my grubby
little fingerprints all over it
so I'm reaching for this nice orangey
kind of shimmery highlighter tone and
I'm taking that on my contouring brush
by Real Techniques so I'm just picking
up some of that product and then placing
it on the top of my cheekbone now I'm
also placing that on the tip of my nose
and also slightly on my nose bridge so
moving on to the eyes I think I'm gonna
be using the l'oreal la palette a nude
in shade beige i want to create like
this copper and black smokey cat i find
a thing so i'm just going to be reaching
for this copper shade right here so I'm
taking that shade on a flat brush and
I'm just packing that in the inner third
of my eye to create a nice a transition
I'm going to be using this third shadow
here which is a really nice neutral kind
of brown tone color and I'm applying
that with my zoeva crease brush I'm just
blending that into the crease for a nice
soft gradient
next I'm moving on to my sleek palette
and this is in shape or natural 6:01 and
from this palette I'm gonna be using
this matte black shadow which is very
pigmented and I'm taking that on my flat
brush and I'm applying that on the outer
half of my eye so so far you try
something like this and don't worry
we're gonna blend this out afterwards so
now we are reaching for a small blending
fluffy brush and I'm just going to blend
that black into the copper shadow you
want to make sure there is no harsh
edges but also you don't want to get rid
of the pigment of the black so I'm now
returning back to my Gloriana palette
and I'm using that same transition color
to blend these shadows out what we're
going to do now is clean up this edge
here and for this I'm going to be using
the MUA cover and conceal concealer so
using the little applicator I'm just
applying that directly underneath our
liner like so and then using a flat
brush I'm just going to blend this out
I'm not taking my copper shadow once
again and I'm pulling that underneath on
my lower lash line this makes my eyes
water so bad and then also return you
back to the black that leaves previously
from the sick palette and I'm just
pulling that onto the lower lash line as
well connecting the wing from the outer
corner I'm also using that shadow to
pull that into my upper lashline Kyllo
into the inner corner and this will just
act as a liner just to line my eyes a
little bit
lastly I'm just going to go over the
black at the outer corner just to kind
of emphasize that pigment that we may
have lost while blending so now I'm now
is you're gonna using any eyeliner I
like how it looks really smokey with
just this shadow but I'm going to be
adding mascara and some false lashes so
for the mascara I'm using the Loreal
false lash wings midnight black which
looks like this I'm just giving a few
coats of that onto my lashes just say
that my false lashes have something to
kind of stick onto
so the artists I'm going to be using
today are the Eco 2 lashes and these are
called naturally beautiful lash system
and these are like demi lashes so they
look very very natural and they're
really kind of like comfortable to wear
I'm not a very big lash girl so these
are great for people who I like starting
out with eyelashes and just one like
that little bit of length to the outer
corners now that I but I'm thinking of
going for something quite natural as the
eyes are super dramatic so I'm gonna be
lining my lips first with the Rimmel
London lasting finish lip line and this
isn't shake cappuccino I love this lip
liner so much because it actually allows
you to overdraw your lips a little bit
but it still looks quite natural let's
finish off the lips I'm going in with
the Rouge Edition velvet by Bourjois and
this is in shade don't pink about it so
that is the final look I hope you guys
