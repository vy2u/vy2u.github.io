today I'm going to be testing out a very
exciting product and that is the ggx of
Maybelline a jetsetter palette oh my god
is so beautiful just look at that
so this palette actually wet himself in
the UK for one day only as like a teaser
thing and it actually sold out within a
90 minutes and I was one of the people
that was actually able to order this
because it was so highly wanted by like
everyone in the UK so I was so glad that
I actually got my hands on one so I can
test it out for you guys I actually
bought this highly quite a few weeks ago
so oh me now am I able to sit down and
really test it for you guys I haven't
even like opened us watched it or
anything so in this video we're just
gonna be seeing whether this palette is
worth the money or what it's like how it
forms and all that good stuff if you
guys enjoyed this video make sure you
smash thank you thumbs up just down
below and if you are brand new and you
have never seen it in my face before
I'm Roxie hi welcome to my channel come
and during the dinosaur family I would
love to have you here
okay but without further ado let's get
on into the video so this palette right
here cost me thirty pounds on boots
which is quite a high-end price but it
says this is a limited edition line and
it has 14 shades I feel like that's a
lot actually too bad of a price to pay
especially when you're obviously paying
up for Gigi Hadid collaboration as well
so first let's talk about the packaging
is so pretty it's like a holographic
metallic kind of casing and it has Gigi
Hadid written in like a really nice at
nude color so inside you have the actual
palette which is like this really nice
nude kind of color
I feel like this kind of packaging has
been so on-trend with like celebrity
collaborations this year so I'm really
really loving the packaging so far the
actual palette is like this cardboard II
kind of sturdy material and this part
here I believe is actually plastic so
it's like this palette II get two
concealers right here two lip colors two
brushes for eyeshadows a brush a bronzer
highlight and
so a little lip balm which I haven't
even opened yet some excited to see that
my initial kind of response to this is
that I feel like this would be a really
good all-around palate to take traveling
with you obviously is called the jet
setter palette so this would be amazing
to take all the play with you if you
just want to get ready because obviously
all of your essential maker bits are
right here in one palette so that is
pretty much the gist of the palette and
I've been dying to try this on my face
for like weeks now and I've just been
refraining putting it off I mean now I
get to play okay so I already have my
foundation on so I'm just gonna skip
straight to you at the concealer so as
you can see there is two different
shades I think I'm gonna use the lighter
shade right here so I'm just going to go
in with my finger I feel like the
product is gonna be super creamy it is
ooh I like it so I'm just gonna take
that and just pop it right underneath my
eyes just to hide any like darkness it's
so far the product is a really nice and
coverage it's covering my dark circles
super well can you guys see that like
look at the comparison I'm actually
super impressed with this concealer I've
got to say like I feel like Maybelline
is known for their concealer so I
already knew that this would be amazing
the coverage is amazing it doesn't feel
like cakey or too heavy on my skin
either I'm just gonna apply it the same
to the other side and also this is super
easy to blend with your finger so you
don't even need it like a brush or
anything I know that this palette comes
with a brush which you could totally use
for your like concealer and stuff but I
feel like my finger it's sometimes the
best option because it just really melts
the product into your skin and gets that
really nice even blend oh my god so I
totally thought that this little thing
in the palette was a lip balm but it
turns out that it's actually a mini
colossal volume express mascara which is
absolutely insane I'm actually even
happier better to mascara because it
just really fits nicely into the palette
and it just means that you don't have to
carry an extra mascara with the palette
now I found out that there's a
as palette it literally has it all okay
so I'm gonna move on to actually
contouring my face a little bit just to
add more shape so I'm gonna be taking
the actual what bronzing a shadow right
here and I'm going to be using the
little brush that comes with the palette
just to test it out it feels really soft
like on the skin so I'm just gonna pick
some of that product up on the brush and
just apply it to my cheekbone I feel
like this has blended out pretty well so
I'm quite impressed especially that
these little brushes that come with
pallets are never really that good but
this one is actually pretty good I'm
gonna do the other cheek bone as well
I'm also gonna go up into my temples and
my forehead just to kind of blend the
whole bronze enos together okay so my
verdict of the bronzer is I feel like
it's really bronzed up my face and I say
it's not too orange it's a really nice
light cool toned bronzer which I love
the pressures okay I mean I'm probably
not gonna use a little brush like this
on a daily basis that's probably just
use my own brush but for traveling can't
really fault it it doesn't job and now
I'm gonna take could be a blush head
just pop that on the same brush and wow
look at that that is so pigmented so
you're definitely not gonna need a line
is gonna go a long way and lightly dab
that on the apples of my cheeks oh that
is such a pretty color the thing with
the Gigi collection I feel like it just
really targets and that natural beauty
look collection is more like the
less-is-more type of thing but these
products are definitely gonna be quite
versatile you can really either have
them a really really bright and
pigmented or you can just have them
quite subtle like Gigi does and that's
what I love about it because it's got
that flexibility so even though it's
really pigmented you can tone it down as
well so that is the blush I feel like
it's giving me a really nice healthy
like color back into my face so I
definitely like that one and now lastly
to finish off the skin I'm gonna be
taking the highlighting shade and this
is a really nice like cool toned
champagne kind of color you can see that
is so pigmented oh my god I'm gonna pop
that on at my cheekbone like so oh my
god guys that is so pigmented I did not
expect it to be that pigmented on my
face like I know that when you
Swach highlighters with your finger
they're always like 10 times more
pigmented than they are in your life but
for this highlighter to perform this
well with this kind of brush I'm done so
that is the highlight and yeah I'm just
I'm obsessed I'm obsessed with the color
I think it's really pretty I think your
suit a lot of different skin tones very
versatile I'm gonna take the little
brush now from the palette and I'm just
gonna take a little bit more of a
highlight and just pop a tiny bit of
that on my nose as well so far I'm
pretty impressed with this look I feel
like the products are performing really
well and if I can look like this when I
get off the plane I'm sold
okay so I've now gonna move on to the
eye makeup so we're gonna be taking the
nude shade from this palette first and
I'm gonna be applying that into the
crease you guys know the drill and
actually gonna be using the little brush
as well just to really test it out and
see if it's good so it's very soft on
the eyes and I don't feel like I'm
stabbing my eye with it which is a good
sign but that's like a really natural
like kind of transition color it's not
too in-your-face but it's definitely
given that definition too at my crease
there's not really any fallout of the
eyeshadow either which is a good sign
because obviously when you're on the go
when you're traveling you don't want to
really thought about with like fallout
and have to worry about that kind of
stuff I'm now gonna take the darker
Brown that shadow here and I love the
fact that all of the like base colors
are matte because I am obsessed with
matte eyeshadows so that's definitely a
really really good shower just can't go
wrong with a good match shadow can you
I'm taking that Brown shadow and I'm
just gonna pop that into the crease as a
little bit more definition through there
and I'm just gonna blend this into like
the outer corner as well so far so good
this brush isn't really letting me down
which I'm actually quite surprised about
I feel like this brown eyeshadow is
actually quite pigmented but it's like
the perfect kind of pigmented so it's
not like to a dramatic and too
in-your-face
but it's definitely a really good color
payoff and it seems that you are quite
easily able to build up the pigment as
well if you want to I'm also gonna take
that on my lower lash line and
blend that kind of aura just to tie in
with the whole smokiness I think I have
obsessed with this brown eyeshadow I
actually love it it's really blended
very well it really complements my skin
tone and my eyes and get it this is
literally like my everyday kind of
makeup anyway so and lastly I'm gonna do
a little bit of a smoky feathered
outliner with the last shadow from the
palette which is a matte black shadow
and it's really awesome because this
little brush comes with a dual ends and
one of them is obviously like the
blending brush but the other is a very
like flat edged brush which you can
obviously use for liner so I'm just
going to pick some of that black shadow
up and just kind of blend this in to my
lashline so put the black eye shadow
I've just created this kind of like
slight winged out feathery kind of line
and I feel like this out shadow is
really pigmented it hasn't got any
fallout which is amazing and yeah I just
was able to create a really easy wing
that's like quite smoky so definitely
give it a thumbs up so far now lastly to
finish off the eye makeup I'm gonna take
the shimmering white kind of eye shadow
from the top and I'm just gonna pop that
into my inner corners as a little bit of
highlight and also my brow bones to kind
of lift up the brow bone as well but I
feel like that Y just really completes
the look it's really giving me a nice
like inner corner highlight and also a
brown bow lift
so I definitely feel like these eye
shadows we're really well thought out
for this palette they all complement
each other and you can really create a
really nice like everyday kind of a
wearable look and then it takes a little
mascara that comes with the palette and
this is the colossal volume Express
which is a mascara that I love from
Maybelline anyway the wand is really
nice and thick which is definitely gonna
make my lashes super volumize so I'm
just gonna take that mascara wand and
just apply that to my top and bottom
lashes oh my god can we just talk about
that mascara that's actually make my
lashes look amazing so that is my face
makeup finish now although is let's do
is apply the lip so I'm gonna be taking
at this really nice pinky color is
actually a choice of two there's like a
really nice like apricot kind of color
but I'm gonna go for the pink today good
for this I'm gonna take my own little
angled brush and just
take some of that product up and apply
it to my lip so that is the lip I
actually love our I think it's so moist
right execute' feels really like soft
and creamy on the left and it's a really
gorgeous color it's like a very neutral
maybe pink kind of color though this is
the final look I actually love it and I
have to say as a verdict of this video
as a verdict of trying all of these
products I do feel like this palette is
worth the money just because it performs
really well it's super compact you get
like a whole face of makeup in one
palette that you can travel with so it's
super travel friendly and I may be a
little bit biased but I love Gigi Hadid
so what can I say but honestly I feel
like all the products have performed
really well I'm super impressed with
everything and yeah I just can't really
fault this talented that it is a little
bit pricy on the drugstore side but at
the end of the day is a collaboration
with Gigi so obviously it's gonna be a
little bit more expensive because you're
paying for the Gigi Hadid brand and also
is the limited edition collection the
packaging is absolutely gorgeous which
obviously Maybelline and Gigi had to put
a lot of effort and money into and plus
you're also getting all of these amazing
product I absolutely love the palette I
can't really folds hair I'm just being
real with you guys obviously this video
is not sponsored I actually bought this
palette with my own money so highly
wanted and I literally had to like wake
up so early to have to get this palette
