we have made it to a primer yay so I'm
in the women's section again around -
what should we go for and come in the
businesswoman kind of area so hard oh my
god I'm just so bad at shopping for
rocks so guys I am now in the men's
section and I literally have no idea
what else I'm going to go for think I'm
going to have a look in the actual sale
section because last time I didn't like
I feel like I could probably find
something decent that we have now got
our bags Matt hasn't seen mine emily is
so how do you think
I like that I have to drop some
accessories in our way we are now back
we have returned from Primark with a
bunch of clothes I haven't seen you out
there and youngji mine oh I just saw
something black get rid of the mouth
okay so he shoes oh gosh I guess I know
you know okay you go first and I'll
probably go away okay let's get our
clear after reading the comments in last
video they actually liked my office yeah
they like to college did I didn't take
my side semi we get the right size I
know I wasn't I was an honest mistake
okay so what something started I've got
I've got obviously a top like top down
the first item is very luxurious this is
the first item
okay this is jumper mm-hmm look at that
it was ten pounds left again very good
shake my boyfriend
yeah definitely bad in the bath top I
have to thank you for my feet oh I like
that and is your soul and I think you
really get this one like 804 misguided
or somewhere so I pretty little thing I
love you okay okay
and what I do well well so an okay well
last time I was all the eyes like 14 I
wanna call medium but I actually looked
at it and I was like this that's about
right okay good so far so good
alright this is going to expect because
without sizing like very basement I just
get out of the way okay there's just a
pair of leggings because they were cheap
there were two pounds or something okay
and I was like a usually but no I didn't
totally get jeans with the whole stuff
yeah when they hot without hope the rich
means yeah I originally got ripped knee
jeans they were ten pounds high I can
afford it all yeah I had that problem
too went for my guys option this yeah
what a game bringing more money to spend
on everything
yeah so good oh favorite part
okay the next item it was a bit risky
huh I got these shoes way conducing
don't like dogs Martin Starr shoes 19
pounds 14 pounds
did you get my size what size for size
high five he loves from the last video
can you have to run a regression had
this really dog burgundy but I did yeah
years ago
tight um velvety material from winter a
night I've done it right let's keep
these up in you hold those something I
mean like is the next accessory matches
them Oh God
I'm going back oh and it matches much
Noel look at the color sustain cover
that is red and then this is personal
person basically um I guess it's close
but we're gonna listen they have I
picked up silver ones of these they were
like a shiny yeah and then I saw this
bright eyes no way
they have to buy the most like I mean me
being the perfectionist I am like I feel
like these don't worry much but I don't
let utilities match or not I kind of
flowers and I maybe I'm just trying to
pick a file in your outfit is perfect
alright and what is it an armpit that's
the end of my affair I didn't even start
but I had to ditch it because I went
over on the price okay so I'm trying for
an awesome look okay that's good yeah
wasn't coming what do you so for my
first pair enjoyment less than 30 but I
won't tell me how do you do - yep so I
guess it's not that bad it's just our
miscommunication which we see what out
to look like on you right now yeah let's
go
okay so this is my outfit and Matt chose
for me I actually have to say that just
from like the first initial look I
actually prefer this outfit better than
the last one home like a lot more I love
this more lifestyle
I would totally wet out the out like I
love everything right now I like the
shoes I like the bag like one thing I do
have to say the color really doesn't
matter completely rent I can match uh it
completely matches look at it it just
depends what lighting it's in but this
is definitely red and it needs a
definitely purple I'm telling you but I
can't really fault the outfit you say
pretty much within the budget what are
you doing
I like that yeah
so now moving on to your outfit should
we have a look okay you nervous are you
excited I'm nervous considering last
time that were launched I've done better
this time I think okay so I'm going to
show you the tops alert right I'm going
to show you the top first I feel like
you will like this so this is the top
and we're kind of based the outfit
around it it's like a camo black simple
t-shirt and how much this was five
pounds everyone okay
and I got a size medium just in case
yeah um I think it's pretty nice it
actually learn it doesn't look like you
could get it from crime like it looks
like you get it for my top shopper from
us yeah no my question x11 time
travelers I actually came across the
same like problem that you then I've
seen before trousers and I really wanted
to give you some cool games but instead
I actually picked up some tracky bottoms
these are just like playing black
Trekkies and the actual like crotch is a
little low it's like a drop crotch no
sir
there's quite low I feel like they're
quite fashionable and they've got like a
little bit on the side and they're also
like into another bottom so they're
quite fitted I like you doing my job
when I like that and he's what only I
think 12 pounds like nighttime doing it
right I get out there just like a chill
kind of sporty outfit yeah not really
cute good for anything but like oh no
I'd like where I'm for like doing any
activities or anything like that I just
get into children
around and then lastly for shoes I
actually couldn't find any like really
nice shoes for men and especially in the
budget I just ended up getting some
screen hello I don't know I don't know
if you're going to like big at all oh
and they're just simple black trainers
they kind of made me think of like Nike
or any - yeah a little bit then similar
shape well um I don't know I guess like
the factor they're a size 12 makes them
look a lot less nice I mean they looked
when they were like a side a then don't
look very comfortable to give you like
the sole that is really plasticky they
kind of look like eBay shooting that is
elastic so yeah they were only nine
pounds okay I only went one pound on
budget and the like outfits all right
you know really quite like the outfit um
I've no idea actually as well after I
try this on why don't we see what we've
looked like nicknamed yeah and then get
you guys to decide who they had good
idea I actually like it a lot more on
than why thought I would want to first
saw it I don't you think you know me
like I'm sure sorry not even that bad
okay I got that like I don't know like
issues uh I almost wouldn't notice I
don't like them yeah because I mean and
the kind of like cuz the offer is
predominately black so it's like a damn
but the probably not gonna be that
comfortable yeah that was like running
running shoes I don't think everybody
confer on TIG Notaro
remember we came is waiting you come
here I'm gonna see this outfit is better
Wow lasting this pose we have vid you
guys thinking better I'm going to talk
