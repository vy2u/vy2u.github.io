in today's video I'm joined it's me by
social guest you have it all the time
for one of you haven't been invited for
a while
Wow today you're in luck because we're
going to be doing another outfit
challenge
yeah well today you're out of luck
because if you remember I win every
outfit challenge well to be fair he does
pretty wealthy like Primark challenges
that we've done in the past for today's
video we thought it'd be funny to try
and get each other an outfit for under
30 pounds ah pervades us let me tell you
something right buying an outfit from
Primark but under 30 pounds is easy I
spent hours on a sauce seriously so we
actually went through like the sell
section and to buy like shoes like a
jacket a full outfit it was difficult
like time and you kept rushing me and
like once you pick the outfit you want
some shoes to go with it and you just
puts you over the budget even the self I
tend to like very expensive on that yeah
Primark is definitely a lot more
affordable but with a sauce there are
some things that I like really expensive
can I just say that like with a sauce
this is the toughest challenge I've done
and I don't know if I'm gonna win it I
really don't by the way if you guys
didn't know I actually do have a
vlogging channel where you are pretty
much on it all the time I said yeah I'm
in it all the time you know we do like
some pretty good content on there I
think I miss the talent don't we yeah I
want to check out these outfits who's
going first I think I should go first
but I'll show you your stuff how does
that mean okay you're gonna show me what
you got for me this is the box
I'm worried by the syphon what the hell
I mean I
you sure you got me like it's more there
I should yeah oh my god well this is my
bus no no right so I'm gonna start off
with the top so this is it wait you look
quite good on the board from what I can
remember right don't open it yeah so
this top was so let me check this was
four pounds okay first impressions nice
tea towel a little bit different to what
you usually wear but I think my first
summary outfit that's kind of what I was
going for like a summer outfit I know
exactly what you've done because in the
past videos everyone has said that
you've picked the safe option that's why
you always lose so you actually stand a
chance for one minute yeah I won't for
something a bit different you know okay
so this yes leave this sleeveless type
of shirt a bit oversized kind of like
you know summery sort of Beach vibes
yeah big colorful for you cuz usually
like to wear like monochrome stuff but I
knew this is actually gonna be right and
for four pounds not bad is it maybe I
should keep this one item I went to some
shorts so these are basically just like
jogger type short and okay these were
ten pounds so 10 pounds that is
literally the most expensive item of the
whole thing they smell good I couldn't
find anything cheaper for shorts for
like trousers ya know everything was so
expensive that Alright
you know they they're cool I like them
they just like plain ones I know you
like to wear like joggers kind of yes
sometimes it's just like a small chillin
yacht you chill out in the movies yeah
yeah no no it's a bit more comfortable
okay I'll go together per se but I'm
hoping that's what the scoring stuff
the next item I have oh you got some
cereal
it's like this tobacco does away this
amazing next thing is shoes let's just
point this out Matt is a size 12 in
shoes now trying to find shoes on Asus
that we're like under 10 pounds was very
difficult trying to find certain like
size 12 in any shop oh yeah any shop so
I love these again summery vibes to
spare I mind
they're like espadrille type shoes and
these were eight pounds okay Jesus sure
I could find right okay so I've never
worn a shoe like that but no it reminds
me of maybe like maybe a mixture of like
a nike running shoe on top with like a
beachy shoe like weird day at the beach
and it kind of goes with the outfit
actually with the shorts there's
actually two items ladders we got so far
three that's five item I know I got
everything under 30 pounds it literally
it was 30 pounds my order oh I don't
know how but I did it so the second well
actually the fourth item is this so I
got your pen Sony's to go with your very
you know summery outfit my awesome hey
guys
okay so some typical aviators yeah so
these were how much were they they've
got 550 nice not bad right yeah I can't
go wrong with that okay all right I just
want to say it's a tenner a ten-foot
like adventurous fun so this last item
cost to pound 50
you know go to town well let's just get
what you've just got a brilliant outfit
I just this looks amazing I can't wait
to see how it looks like that came 230
pounds what your thoughts I think you I
think you're trying to win over the
people with just making me look like an
idiot to be honest it was just so
difficult to get like a decent outfit in
that like yeah yeah no I agree because
it took me a while to find it out
happier
I went serious okay anyways I think we
should try on the outfit now all right
so this is the outfit it's gonna it's my
wife yes I'd like probably just tailor
write a little bit it makes you look
very wide doing a tailor I shoes you
know she's not that would you like this
actually yeah it's nice but it did yes
but I have a good tip for everyone here
size up on a sauce because I ordered
some converse you add a note sorry Oh to
converse 12 fit perfect ordered a sauce
own 12 tight these are a still sorry I
think hard but I don't if they do a
slice 13 that's the thing like I don't
point five I don't know like maybe but I
don't know does anyone else get that
with like a sauces on shoes these are
yeah not as well yeah
my toes are like this like the top is
definitely very summery like the the
trainings are a little bit more like I
have to - I hate at the top in the
packet yeah I thought it was a problem
is I would wear anything else so I wish
just I'd go out right now it's raining
outside
no I will I want to go to your outfit
yeah yeah I have three items okay all
right I'm gonna stop any we're gonna
stop with the worst item all right so
people forget about it by the time I get
the neck size shoes I'm sorry you can't
get shoes a leg sauce by the ten pounds
I'm just gonna take them out they were
$9.99 um I hate them you know they're
just like Johnny no not that bad dolly
suede type shoes person it's worse I'm
$9.99 $9.99 is so bad is nothing new
like so okay actually for me Oh God
I know but I think you're being too hard
on yourself I think all right then all
that bad
the one if that's the worst thing then
I'm looking forward to see what the best
things are yeah okay um so then you've
got your mercy hello this cereal was
talking about your bag ice but you see
Houseman over the a palace the others I
spent $29.99 oh let's just go for the
main event let's just get it out okay
this is a thing there's a playsuit and
open it up all right it's from big
right alright so that was 15 pounds Wow
for like your main I just like it sticks
up the budget yeah it's just shorts RIS
I was really worried that's not bad I
mean it's a bit like look at this
yeah like okay really
it's not about it looks kind of like a
beach kind of cover up more than yeah
really well it's from boohoo and the
shorts are cute they're just kind of
like simple okay I like the vibe I mean
these shoes and this oh I have another
item I guess that could be alright okay
I spent the rim remainder of my money on
this it was 5 pounds it's a bracelet is
that bracelet kind of bracelet is a
bracelet and it was five pounds that was
the cheapest thing I have five pounds
that fast like you know what can i buy
and that was really it's just like
common is it too small no you can like
adjust it okay but it's just like a
little gold bracelet you know that's not
bad like you went for a safe option I
think this time no I didn't know he did
I guess I would wear this but let's try
it on is he how looks alright is my
outfit I think I've done it everyone or
do you think it's good it needs an iron
yeah definitely definitely means a lion
there's not that bad this is what it
looks like from the back yeah does it
look like from the back yeah it's got
the got your jewelry there not my
bracelet
and my shoes yeah I mean it's very
simple this outfit but I wouldn't really
say that is bad like I would actually
wear this out I do smile it's very like
plain like simplistic yes not bad it's
not bad yeah I have to say it's not that
bad so these are outfits together I feel
like we're very ready to

across the beach our feet in a lot pain
