video in so long sorry today what we
filming 25 30 but that's not my father
that's your but I just okay so basically
I went into Primark and I was like I
don't think I can do this not not 25 so
I had to go up to 30 so excit is the
budget but yeah that's definitely like
an extra point to me already because I
could've stopped hey not bad that's not
fair I just got some extra memory by the
way fences in Primark way more expensive
than women remember it's true dear I've
enjoyed this video make sure you smash
that he thumbs up it just down below and
also subscribe if you want to become a
part of the dinosaur family so let's
rewind back to earlier when we were in
Primark let's go so we are now a Primark
and it's very busy around here right
guys so I'm in the men wear section and
I let you have no idea where to start so
I'm in the women's section and I haven't
got a clue maybe this stain on anything
probably
then yeah under this pillow here okay so
well afterwards like the next video to
see right yeah so guys we have just
finished picking out the outfit I how
did you find it I found it quite
difficult
yeah it was so difficult other girls in
Primark for inspiration oh yeah oh yeah
well it I didn't manage to really get
all kind of nervous
anyways yeah let's go back home and have
a look and see how we did with the
outfit I'm nervous so here we have a
huge Primark bag that has not seen at
the contents of my bag and I haven't
seen here so I'm very excited to see
what you picked out I kind of nervous
yeah I mean like I did alright okay you
know I think it was a challenge I want
to get faster shall I oh okay god I miss
Allah
okay say just pick out I'm gonna my
junior class prime not cool that's
problem I'm going to be bigger than you
okay so first up it's a pair of jeans
right size a the blue super skinny
I like these actually I think I have a
pair light is actually know how much
money is you only know high waisted
jeans he knows Hey
so the cost of these was 12 pounds
pretty good pretty good right but you
can trying everything on after I think
okay sir ah I'm happy though this next
thing I'm not sure about I bought it
because I remember a few years ago or
even though if you guys just in autumn
II always used to wear like that shirt
that had got autumn II kind of mind to
it
right so I got sure it's not autumn
vibes but it should like summer vibes I
guess okay let's left it
it's got this going something is going
on
okay look like a pet something don't pet
like I'm wearing one today
yes your honor your style and it's got
some birds on it and oh that's the front
I'll put it on the front it's not but
you know like I like the style of it I
don't know how we go for like the prints
I
I don't realize the print it's just got
like birds on it it's not bad it's just
not really my my cup of tea
what you saying it down I'm oh no I love
that I don't like very much but the
actual cut of the top is very nice come
up with it
this was hey what size you for tops
uh-oh
I'm gonna hate that so this is 10 pounds
we'll see in the trial section 8 I mean
in a that's my side though so maybe it's
just like would you buy that maybe it
might be a bit big but anyway would you
buy it you know I gotta say I mean
probably know you tried all right no no
it is not my style
okay all right so next thing I got with
pair shoes okay and it's just kind of
going with the same vibe of laughs so
I've shown to the camera let's look at
our faces there we go
so it's like these little ones going
babies they're like little flowers
there's all these little flowers on them
where I actually did you only kind of
remind me of I have a son called Daisy
oh no it's like framing the shooter
spraying to rip it off there we go like
oh look this is what reminds me of the
Daisy partying is pretty much the same
kind of flower yeah my message
remember that in the back of my head
alright oh and check out the price five
pounds
darris ice for the first five did you
not know that sighs I know you're she
sighed and it was very difficult to get
your shoe size we're gonna say it's good
ah oh I feel like I've lost the
satisfaction of being a biscuit I know
they're all right I think I wear them I
don't know if I'll be able to actually
squeeze my foot into them - there they
are a size four are you gonna give it
goodness I'll give it a go yeah I'm
right and this side so I've been
watching my pennies and that's why I've
got so many accessories oh oh you didn't
give me any cutters album with Heller
expenses I've got three accessories they
come these are the three accessories I
got I did some earrings
Oh people 60p Wow yeah pretty cool good
job good job
I've come to Cameron's oh okay the jeans
were 12 pounds oh wait when you were
buying it you didn't see that it was
over I had a cat that I bought as well
well you failed the challenge what that
goes around your neck got me a little
choker and I got this ah so it sounds
for oxy or rocks or is nice and start I
was going to go like here Oh like you
know really what kinda accessory oh my
god I would never do that
okay well I think you still did pretty
well so let's go try the outfit on again
so this is my outfit what do you think
awesome like it's good right
I mean I just really don't like the
Shona I'm loving alive like it's just
not really my cup of tea is nothing
wrong with it I just
we're right know how to feel like an old
are you like someone's mom I feel like a
mummy then honestly you know if what I
say is okay but it's just not not
telling I'd wear really but because that
made me put on my trap oh yes cause
that's right go it's a key change horses
to go oh my gosh I'm definitely gonna
win we'll see so now I'm gonna be able
to you out there are you ready for this
yeah I think you would have done right I
think I did pretty good
and I stayed in the budget unlike some
people I'm sorry you went over the
budget didn't issue a sec okay so the
first thing I got you is happy so the
first thing I got you is this little
basic top kind of similar to what you're
wearing now really but what is simple
when I liked it so this was actually
five pounds this is only five pounds so
I think I can only get it right with
that all right
you played it safe then I played it safe
but I like a good basic top rating yeah
I'll go wrong and now a short I feel
quite like the shape these like a these
the whole outfit was pretty much built
around me because they were really
expensive there were 14 pounds that's
like half of my budget does that a lot
and yeah I think I did pretty good
because let me just get rid of this
little plane so this is what they look
like
I think they're cool yeah I like these
ice they haven't got any dark gray Jean
yeah they like it thanks not we can
return and now the shoes oh my god this
was the most difficult part because
you're a size 12 and let me tell you I
can't find size 12 anywhere I can't even
find all the good shoes like that were
actually like nice they were just like
they didn't have a 5 but I managed to
find me
like you wish they kind of look like
hunger like half combat and they're
inside 12 pretty good any yeah um yeah
alright hey you know that cool yeah
playing it down you guys just what yeah
yeah and you love yourself it's about
the outfit okay yeah let's judge it when
I put my whole outfit
alright alright let's good try this
woman good so what do you think you can
sit well I'm definitely one number nine
how oh look at this you go the wrong
side okay alright but hi I should pick
that up by accident so I think the pasar
sorry - I did that wanted to say it's
alright but once for creativity hey oh
yeah that's an outfit that I probably
would wear usually yes it is but it's
just a chain with the patterns because I
thought I picked up some attitude but
it's actually say yeah very good
just to show you a short I know Oh what
do you think of your outfit I feel very
uncomfortable
Oh embellishments are so tight this it
must be well uncomfortable to say no
right no hay un I think you win not only
by luck because if I didn't make that
mistake I'll go around right you went
over budget
initially you got the wrong side shot
you and every budget and your luck
creativity creativity in this this bow
is the end of the video and let's know
