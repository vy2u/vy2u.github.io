ya go got her hair done today
oh yeah it doesn't actually look that
different but I got it a whole lot more
faded so you know it's a lot more
socially acceptable now and doesn't look
like outgrown roots what's up everyone
welcome back to my channel so in today's
video we're gonna be doing the Google
pics my makeup challenge this challenge
is created by a fellow youtuber
nikkietutorials I'm sure you guys all
know who she is but I'll link her video
down below if you guys haven't seen it
already but if you guys haven't seen the
challenge yet basically what you have to
do is you have to type in at the first
initial of your name and sign him into
Google followed by the word look you
then have to click images and the first
photo that comes up is the inspiration
of foiler this pretty much just
generates a random picture from the face
of the internet that you have no control
over and that will basically be the
inspiration of the look how about
actually seen what my image is just yes
who might be super difficult let's type
in RJ into Google images and see what
comes up oh okay this is so bad actually
I had to work with this so what I'm
seeing is a beautiful lady I'll pop the
picture right here and basically she's
just wearing like an OOTD I feel like
it's just a outfit of the day sort of
pic however there's some interesting
colors in there so what I'm seeing is
kind of a lot of Blues now I don't
usually tend to wear anything blue on my
face just because my eyes are super
bright blue and I feel like it's just a
little bit too overpowering and then see
some Browns which I could definitely
work with some like red sort of tones
which I love to wear in my eyes I'm
already getting a few ideas
what else do I see she's wearing some
black accessories I could use that as my
eyeliner yes wait a second do I see some
yellow in here yes I could use like a
pop of color of like yellow I love
yellow at the moment I am so glad that
this girl is wearing white cuz I can
totally is that like the highlight in my
inner corners yes girl the creative
juices are flowing okay so I'm just
gonna pull out a bunch of products I'm
gonna use for this video out of my Alex
drawers right there and I'll be right
back how much you're kind of nervous for
this video you guys because I've never
done anything like this where I
literally just do my look on camera
that's completely improvised I always
have some kind of idea what I want the
look to be but this is lace she just
totally
improvised so first up to begin the look
I think I'm gonna go with what I know so
that is the naked heat pallet I
literally use this on a daily basis
pretty much so from the Google image I'm
just gonna pull out those warm tones
sort of colors and this palette is just
perfect for that the first time I'm
taking the shade sauce which is this one
right here and I'm gonna just apply that
through the crease I absolutely love it
putting like a warm tone sort of orange
color through the crease especially if
you've got blue eyes I feel like just
makes your eyes pop so much I'm then
gonna take the even darker red color
which is the shade he doubled from the
heat palette and I'm gonna take that
kind of like all over the lid I'm just
going to kind of pop that all over the
lid so that the transition color can
blend really nicely into it oh my god I
love this color is so beautiful is it
just me or when someone's lik she just
started applying the red eyeshadow it
always looks like they've got like a
pink eye or something until they clean
it up and add some lashes but until it
gets to that point where it's finished
it just looks like a wreck of a whole
time now I'm just gonna repeat the same
thing at to the other side as well okay
so now that all of that is blended out
I'm just thinkin what to do next it's
kind of difficult you know I'm thinking
maybe of pulling the yellow the slight
pop of yellow from this picture and just
kind of going to town with it before the
yellow I'm gonna be using at this little
mono shadow from NYX
this isn't shade guilded and it is
literally such a beautiful vibrant
yellow only I could get into it though
these nails are literally wracking my
life this is what it looks like it is
literally so so pretty I'm just gonna
pick that up on a little a packing brush
like so and it just kind of popped that
in the very center of the lid as like
her slight pop of color you know oh yes
this is beautiful
now that the pop of color is on I'm
actually gonna return it back to the
like red shadows I feel like I need to
intensify it just a little bit more so
much gonna take and Fuego I think that's
how you pronounce it this is just like a
really really dark sort of burgundy
color so I'm just gonna pick that up on
a little buffer brush from zoeva and
just buff that into at the very outer
corners and this burgundy color is just
gonna kind of intensify that outer
corner and just make the whole look a
little bit more smoky and a little bit
more deeper okay
visually what I'm talking about okay so
I feel like I've kind of played it a
little bit safe so far so I'm now gonna
move on to the blues from the image so
in my inspiration photo at the lady has
a blue background behind her and also
she's wearing some a denim jeans so I
feel like this little bad boy is perfect
so this is the Kiko Milano sparkling
trail trail trail eyeshadow pencil well
more like a crayon really it's very
thick and the color is such a pretty
Navy so what I'm gonna do with this is
I'm gonna be kind of daring I let you
never do anything like this for my
makeup and I'm actually gonna take this
and basically run it along my lower lash
line and really smudge it out I feel
like that blue smudged underline is so
on-trend right now especially since Kim
K and Mario released their new and
makeup reign and they sported like the
whole blue look I feel like it's such a
nice understated and still wearable way
to wear blue so I'm just gonna take care
underneath and really just smudge it out
afterwards okay that is a look so we're
not just gonna really try and blend this
out into the lash line and make it smoky
as possible but then just gonna return
back to the Naked 2 heat pallet and use
this a color right here which is kind of
like a transition shade and I'm gonna
take that on a big fluffy brush and just
blend this underneath the blue just to
kind of tie it with the rest of my skin
and make it a lot more faded because at
the moment it's kind of looking
cray-cray
so the next part is eyeliner I'm
actually quite lucky that in the photo
there's some black shades so I can get
away with using a some black liner the
four liner today I'm gonna be using at
the NYX a vinyl a liquid liner in shade
of black and with this which is going to
be creating a subtle black wing if
there's anything that's gonna complete
this look and that is eyeliner
when in doubt line out so my liner is
now done and I'm now gonna return it
back to the yellow and use a little tiny
pencil brush like this and I'm just
going to apply this kind of like
underneath the inner corner to sort of
pull that yellow back in through the
look I'm then gonna take this a white
jumbo pencil from NYX this is a shade of
cottage cheese at which is kind of a
weird name but it's like a really pretty
white iridescent sort of pencil I'm just
gonna apply that right in the inner
corners just to kind of apply a little
bit more light in there and open up the
eyes again next time I'm gonna take it
the NYX at white liquid liner and with
this I'm just gonna add it the slightest
line right underneath the wing it just
to kind of add a pop of light which I'm
then just gonna pop some yellow over to
kind of tie in it with the rest of the
look so this is it for the eye shadow I
honestly I'm obsessed with how those
look turned out it's so out of my
comfort zone and it's not a look that I
would ever really come up with unless I
did this challenge so I feel like this
challenge has definitely gotten me to be
a lot more creative but with my look so
now I'm just gonna finish off the look
or with some lashes so these are the
Lily lashes at from beautybay and these
are in style
opulence which I am the loving recently
so my lashes are now on and I've also
completed the rest of my makeup I just
popped on at some foundation concealer
and also bare bronzer and highlight and
I'm now gonna move on to the lips so for
the lip I'm again gonna pull out those
warm tones and from the picture so a
first up is a lip liner now for this I'm
gonna be using the Rimmel cappucino lip
liner which is one of my all-time
favorites and I'm just gonna line my
lips with this
and to finish off the label we're going
to be taking the trusty Mac velvet teddy
so this is the makeup look that Google
hasn't picked for me I honestly had so
much fun filming this look I feel like
I've been a lot more adventurous with
this makeup than I usually am I have to
say I'm one of those people that never
really likes to experiment with much
color especially on my eyes at all but
I'm actually honestly really surprised
with the way this look turned out and I
have to say I imagine kind of proud of
this look I feel I could definitely a
bit out of my comfort zone and it's
definitely a lot more creative then I
usually tend to go for you guys did
