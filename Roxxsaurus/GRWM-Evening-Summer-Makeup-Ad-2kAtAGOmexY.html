guys all well today as you can see I'm
in a different background and don't be
used to this it's not like a permanent
thing but anyways today I'm going to be
creating it let's make a plug and if you
guys like this video then be sure to
give a thumbs up and subscribe this
channel as well as my blog channel but
always all my social media will be
listed down below I have that probably
let's jump right into the video first
I'm gonna start with my eyebrows I'm
gonna be using the two at L'Oreal Paris
brow artist brow gels and these are
really good especially if you're on the
go because they have the little
applicator to fill in your brows and
they also have a brush to actually set
your brows so first I'm reaching for the
lighter shade which is in shape blonde
and with this I'm going to be filling in
the very beginnings of my brows
we're not just going to you said work to
come up the beginnings of my brass
theory so I'm just brushing them up
hoods and then to the side I'm now
taking the second shade of the brown
artists and this is in shade brunette so
it's just a tiny bit darker and I'm
gonna be using this to fill in the arch
and the tail of my brow just because
naturally there is more hair there and
when your browser more dense they're
gonna look darker in that area so adding
a darker shade there just kind of wrap
the case that for you in a very natural
way and then I'm also going to use the
brush to break everything through so
these are the brows done I'm now going
to go in with the L'Oreal Paris that
latouche machine to concealer and
hopefully use this you can hear at my
browser little bit so I'm just taking up
over the brow and also all underneath
and this is just going to give the brow
and much more defined and crisp shape so
I'm not gonna let that concealed with my
finger select that can see the bones
really seamlessly into the skin visit
the browser done I've really been loving
the bold brow look which is why I went
for something a little bit more dramatic
to what I usually wear on my brows and
now moving on to the eyes I'm gonna be
reaching for thee that palette nude in
shape a foreigner air Paris and I'm
going to be taking the third shape here
which is like the light brown and I'm
using that in my crease as a transition
he never combos with a brush I just
basically sweeping that back and forth
into the crease to add a lot more depth
now that we've added the transition
color I'm going to be rooting for this
single eyeshadow and this is such a
gorgeous shade like it's so so pigmented
and it's super gold and I'm just taking
that on my finger because I want the
most pigmentation out of this and I'm
just going to be packing it on into the
center of my lid like so and also
pulling that into inner corner I'm also
taking that other little flat brush and
I'm going to be putting that into the
inner corner of our eyes as well and now
for the same shout-out we're easing that
this single once this cool just like
perfectly plumb shadow I'm just going to
be using this to add a little bit more
definition to at the outer crease so
once again I'm taking it on my little
flat brush for the most pigmentation and
I'm just gonna start placing that onto
the outer corner I've been going with a
blending brush not to blender this in
and we'll just shred it we're going to
create a subtle smokiness but it is
something a little bit different because
you don't usually see gold and purple as
pack together I'm also going to be using
the same shadow it's you drive along my
lower lash line to just tie the whole
smokiness together
and now we're going to go in with our
eyeliner and the eyeliner thing today is
that the Superliner superstar by L'Oreal
Paris and with this I'm going to be
creating a very classic winged liner so
now to finish off the eyes I'm going to
using at this L'Oreal Paris and false
lashes focus camera so this is the final
look I think it's so so pretty it's
something a little bit different to what
I usually work but garlis I really love
it and I think it's going to be great
for like summer nights and if you're
going out for parties and stuff like
that because it's really sparkly and
it's a little bit on the dramatic side
but it's still pretty wearable but that
is all for this video I hope you guys
