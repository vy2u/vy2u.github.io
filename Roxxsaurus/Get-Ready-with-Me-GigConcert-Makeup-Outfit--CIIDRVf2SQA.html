you a video on how to kind of get ready
for a gig I'm going to go to a gig
tomorrow to see one of my favorite bands
ever and they're called architects if
you're not into kind of like metal slash
Punk
yes slash screamer music then it's not
going to be your cup of tea but if it is
then check the markers they're so
amazing and I get to see them tomorrow
so I thought I'd film this quick kind of
get ready with me video show you the
makeup and the outfit that I'm gonna
wear so let's decide make sure before
anything make sure you use some primer
I've used the Alpha prime buffer all
over the face just before I apply my
foundation make sure you also use a
waterproof makeup just in case you cry a
little bit like have a fangirling moment
I probably will or if you just swear you
know you can't avoid getting sweaty at a
gig so make sure you use some waterproof
makeup so makeup doesn't budge and slide
down your face because that's never a
cute look before anything else I
apologize for this face demon right here
it's my placing I literally bumped it
like a second ago and it's model red and
I'm sorry it's still in the healing
process so just bear that in mind I
don't just have like a spot on my nose
it's just my piercing is being a bit
weird and anyway the eyeliner I'm going
to go for like a really dramatic cat
wing kind of a bit like in Winehouse
style I'm using this Maybelline gel
liner I find that gel liners work best
in the last the longest so if you do
slip up and have a oh my god
that gave me a heart attack so if you do
have a bit of a moment and slip up and
cry which I probably will just it won't
smudge as quickly and if you have a
waterproof eyeliner that's even better
but I don't have one so I'm just going
to use a gel liner and I'm just applying
it quite heavily to the eyelid
moving on I'm now focusing on the
eyelashes and I'm using me falsify
mascara by 17 and I like some scar
because it really accentuates the extent
xn shoot sense Shh
anyway I'm applying that all over the
eyelashes
I kind of like the spidery effect that
this mascara gives next is a blusher
today I'm going to be using the out
blush which that's my best it's this
kind of I'm not too sure how to describe
this color it's kind of like a peachy /
brown color and it's in shade I'm not
too sure what shade that's in because
elf has really weird like labeling but
yes I'm just taking my Bobbi Brown brush
and just loading that on and applying it
to the apples of my cheeks it's color is
very neutral but it does give a bit of
color to the face next up is the bronzer
today I'm going to be using the YSL
bronzer and I've hit pan because I love
this product so much it's got a bit of
shimmer to it but I absolutely
love it it's great and to apply this I'm
going to be using my ELF love brush but
I like this because it's got that little
dip so it's like a dome shape and it
just fits right in your cheekbone so I'm
sliding that up on my brush scooping
that underneath the cheek
I'm also going to take that and apply it
right here just to give by socket and
I'm going to squish the brush like so so
it creates a thin shape take the product
and kind of contour the sides of my nose
a little bit lastly I'm going to finish
off this look with a red lip but first
I'm going to use a red lip liner just so
that make sure it stays in place and
doesn't budge or smudge and I'm using
the barium one by the way what's that
sound I'm taking my collection lipstick
and this is in Gothic April on revenge
323 and I love this lipstick so much it
looks so classy and glamorous and the
shade is just perfect so I'm just
applying that over my planner
so this is the final that guys this is
the makeup I know it's kind of simple
anyone give this about a tutorial but I
just fun to film it's very kind of
classic but grungy and chick kind of
reminds me of the 60s because of the
really exaggerated cat wing so yeah this
is the makeup and now let's move on to
the outfit
