channel so today I'm going to be
creating this really gorgeous and
angelic look was really big fluttery
eyes inspired by Gigi Hadid so if you
guys want to see how to achieve this lid
then just keep on watching so to start
this makeup I'm going to be using my fit
me Maybelline foundation and this is
really good for those of you who are
looking for an affordable foundation
that's also map and it has really good
coverage as well next I'm going to be
reaching for my maybelline camo
correcting palette and I'm taking the
lightest shade and I'm just popping that
underneath and my eye circles because I
have not been having enough loot lately
and this helps so much because it really
gets rid of your under-eye bags and it
corrects them at the same time moving on
to the brows I'm going to use my brow
drama pomade crayon and I love this one
so much because the color is just
perfect it's cool tone it's not orange
at all and it's so easy to apply to add
a little bit of definition and warmth to
my face I'm going to be using at the
master console palette and I'm taking
the console shade and is basically
sculpting out my cheekbones and
circumference of my face in general I'm
also going to reach for a smaller fluffy
brush and apply this to the bridge of my
nose to contour as well or the highlight
I'm going to take my master strobing
liquid and can we just talk about the
color of this this shade is so beautiful
it blends so seamlessly into the skin
and just makes you look like a radiant
goddess I'm telling you in a reference
picture of GG she's wearing like a
really nice
pinky blush so I'm just taking the blush
from the same palette and applying that
to the apples of my cheeks moving on to
the eyes I'm going to be using the nude
eyeshadow palette from Maybelline these
colors are so versatile there's a lot of
cool tones and also warm tone shadows in
here so firstly I'm taking this and
brown a kind of transition shade and I'm
just popping that in at my creeps to
kind of add a little bit of subtle
definition right there next I'm taking
this gold shadow which is so beautiful
and I'm just popping that on my inner
third of the eye as well as like the
very center of my lid and then I'm
taking the darker gold shade from this
palette and I'm popping that in the very
outer corner to add more definition
there and just really create that nice
smokiness
I'm not taking up that same gold
eyeshadow that we put on our lid and I'm
just popping that underneath onto my
lower lash line and then taking a darker
brown shadow and just popping that in
the outer corners of my lower lash line
to add some definition so line my eyes
I'm then taking
master precise liquid liner from
Maybelline and I'm just creating the
tiniest flick because in the reference
picture of Gigi she was wearing very
minimal liner just enough to kind of
define the upper lash line moving on to
mascara I'm going to be using my
Maybelline push up angel mascara to get
that really fluttery effect to my lashes
what I love about this brush the most is
the comb it really allows you to capture
like all of the small lashes I have
quite stumpy lashes so this is a great
brush for me as not only does it go all
my lashes clump free but it also lifts
them and calls them at the same time
it's also amazing for the bottom lashes
as it really grabs onto every single of
those lashes even if they're very tiny
now moving on to the lips I'm using this
lip contour palette and firstly I'm
going to prime my lips with step one of
the palettes to achieve a really nice
smooth base for the lip product and then
taking this pinky shade because it's the
closest one that's to the reference
picture and I'm applying that all over
the lips I'm then taking at the darker
shade of the lip palette and I'm using
that as a little contour just to really
contour my lips and make them look more
puffy therefore is the highlight this
was such a cool thing to have in the lip
palette so I'm just popping that in a
central moment make them look even more
powerful and that is the final look
inside by Gigi Hadid I think this is
such a pretty look and I really hope you
guys enjoyed this little tutorial I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day and
I'll see you in my next one alright now
we're on the fly solo the sky day right
and our light devil energy that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
