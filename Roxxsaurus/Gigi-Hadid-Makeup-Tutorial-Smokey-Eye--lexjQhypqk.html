filming at this gigi hadid inspired
makeup like I think she wore this on
like kind of sporty restricted red
carpet or something I don't really know
don't quote me on that but I will link
the picture that I'm using is reference
in the description bar you guys enjoyed
this video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe and if you want
to follow me on any of my social media
my Twitter Instagram and snapchat are
all rock surahs same way it's about here
so if you guys want to know how to get
this face then definitely keep a watch
it so investing in a promo lens using
the other decay eyeshadow primer potion
and this is the anti-aging one I'm just
going to pop that on the lid so that all
the eyeshadow that we're going to apply
later on glides on really smoothly so
for the eye makeup I'm thirsty starting
off with the Too Faced chocolate bar
semi-sweet palette this is such a cute I
shadow palette and it smells of
chocolate which is like double win so
firstly I'm going to be reaching up for
the shade coconut cream just to kind of
set the primer in place so I'm using my
zoeva luxe crease brush to kind of sweep
that really lightly all over the lid and
because this is such a light shadow it's
not really going to show up I'm only
using this for the purpose of a really
clean and smooth canvas now for the
crease I'm going in with this nice pinky
shade here and this is going to act as a
really nice transition shade so I'm just
blending that through the crease
next I'm going to be reaching for this
shade here which is called peanut butter
and I'm going to using that to further
deepen up the crease so when Gigi's eyes
are open I shadow look is quite tapered
out to almost create this cat-like wing
so I'm placing down the shadow in a V
motion so I'm blending it into the
crease and also joining it down to the
lower lash line like so so at the moment
this makeup look is looking quite orange
but we want it to look more pink so to
add that pink pop of color I'm actually
gonna be using a blush because I feel
like this is a really close shade to
what she's wearing though this is the
blush by sleek and this is in shade
flush 9 through 5 if you guys have been
here for a long time this is a major
throwback because I used to use this for
like almost every makeup tutorial when I
first started using the seams of a
crease brush I'm going to just pick some
of that shadow up really lightly and
start blending that into the crease and
we want to follow that tapered outline
that we've already created and then I'm
also diffusing that color into the
center portion of my eye as well as the
inner corner I'm also going to blend
that onto my lower lash line as well
very very lightly so now that we've
finished placing down at the guideline
of this whole look can now focus on
adding the darker shades and of course
the glitter so to start off I'm going to
be picking up Punk which is this dubbed
chestnut shade which also has like a
purpley undertone to it and using a
smaller fluffy brush I think this one is
by Bobbi Brown and really focusing that
into the outer corner and crease and
again I'm creating this V I'm not going
in with my zoeva brush to blend this out
now whatever is left on my brush I'm
just going to sweep that into the inner
corner as well just to add a little bit
more depth there so this is what it
should look like so far and now I'm
going to go ahead and add in the glitter
which is like the most fun part so I'm
going to be using a mixture of these two
shades which is pop and Harajuku and
with my zoeva smokey shader I'm just
patting that into the center of my lid
I'm also going a little bit above and
beyond the core
because in her makeup she's got quite a
lot of glitter up in this portion of her
lid so now I'm just going to go ahead
and repeat that to the other eye I'm now
returning back to the shade I'm gonna be
sweeping that on my lower lash line with
the smokey shader and I'm also going to
be taking the shade part of my flat
brush once again and just sweeping that
underneath my people on the center of my
lower lash line I'm now just going to
dust off any fallout that may have
fallen down onto my cheeks I'm going to
be going in with just a little bit of
foundation just to clear up the skin get
an even complexion and for this I'm
going to be using the Giorgio Armani
maestro fusion makeup foundation so I'm
just popping a few drops of that
ultimate Oliva buffer brush and just
lightly buffing that into the skin
and then just going to conceal
underneath my eyes with the Rimmel wake
me up concealer and I'm using this
little flat brush to blend this out
next time that I just bronze up my face
using new to face to bronzer in shade
light to medium and there's also smells
like chocolate which honestly just makes
me wanna eat it so for this I'm using my
Real Techniques blush brush because it's
quite a big fluffy size now for my
highlight I'm using this rosy for
autograph highlighter and this is in
shade rosebud look how gorgeous the
packaging is as well it's copper it's
amazing so I'm using my Real Techniques
contour brush and just picking up some
of the product and just dusting that
over my cheek bone just like wanna drown
myself in this it's so nice also going
to put a little bit on the tip of my
nose and down the bridge Gigi's eyebrows
I like hashtag goals but my eyebrows are
too arched and structures to kind of
replicate her look so today what I'm
going to do is just brush some jaw
through them and this is the Born This
Way brow gel by Rimmel I don't know how
she does it like her brows look really
sparse but they live a really nice
somehow now for the lip it seems like
she's wearing a satin nude shave so the
closer show that I have to this is this
one by Lancome and this is a shade 218
I'm just going to pop that over the lip
oh my god I totally forgot mascara I'm
gonna using one of my favorite drugstore
mascaras which is actually really
fitting for this tutorial because Gigi
is the face of Maybelline and this is
the falsies push-up drama mascara
so this is the final like I hope you

to my golds and browns and neutral
colors so this is really fun to film so
