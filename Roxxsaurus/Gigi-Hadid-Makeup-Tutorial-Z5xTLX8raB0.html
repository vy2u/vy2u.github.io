filming a gigi hadid inspired makeup
look I posted a picture on it my
Instagram asking you guys if you wanted
to see this look and loads of you were
like hell yeah so I decided to recreate
it a lot of you actually saw that this
was me in the photo um I'm very
flattered thank you but I don't think I
look anything like her to be honest but
I do love her so thank you so yeah I
mean if I did a good job on this look by
giving me a thumbs up and subscribe if
you're not already
so without febrile and let's just jump
right into the tutorial that I've
already started off by filling my
eyebrows just to save a little bit of
time and for this I used the bodyshop
brow definer in the shade brunette my
girls don't really look like Gigi's
because mine are quite art and hers I'm
all round but I just tried to kind of
fill in this bit here to make them look
a bit more rounder than usual for the
skin I'm going to start off with the
pure correcting primer and this is
really good for like under-eye circles
just before you apply foundation because
this has like an orange II kind of tint
to it so if you have any darkness it
kind of corrects it a little bit and
covers it up I also like applying this
under my eyes just before I apply any
concealer because it just makes sure
that the concealer glides on smoothly
and does increase throughout the day for
my foundation I'm going to be mixing
these two different foundations the
first one I'm using is the YSL Touche
claw and the second one is the
infallible sculpt by L'Oreal and I'm
mixing these two to get the perfect
shade because this one is a little bit
too dark for me so I'm just taking a
pump of each and I'm applying that
straight to these a Weaver buffer brush
I get a lot of questions all the time or
what brushes I use I use these a Weaver
brushes and these are the rose gold
edition so I just have two little dots
on my buffer brush and I'm just going to
kind of Pat that onto the skin I don't
like to apply my foundation all over the
face just the kind of problematic areas
here and there so that gives a really
nice base for the makeup and now we're
just going to set it with the Studio Fix
by Mac so I'm just taking my Real
Techniques blush brush and unleash
you're just dusting that all over the
face to get a nice even matte finish in
this makeup look that I'm recreating
Gigi has a nice like defined bronzy kind
of look I feel like she always has like
a really bronzed to go less kind of
to her face anyway basically to kind of
replicate that I'm just using my the
balm Bahama Mama bronzer this is a
really nice cool toned bronzer and I'm
just applying that with the same brush
from Real Techniques so I'm just kind of
bronzing up my cheeks a little bit to
kind of define my cheekbone I'm also
going to be placing that in my temple
and also the forehead to make it appear
a little bit smaller I'm also going to
take it on the jawline slightly to kind
of define a little bit more I'm not
going to be moving onto blush in this
lip Gigi doesn't actually seem to be
wearing that much of a blush I'm going
to go in with a very neutral like pinky
shade and this is the L'Oreal Paris
blush in shade nectarine so I'm taking
my Real Techniques contour brush and I'm
really light handedly just placing that
on the apple of my cheek being onto the
ice I feel that her eye makeup is kind
of neutral it has a little bit of like
pink and brown running through the
crease which is something I actually do
for my own makeup quite a lot anyway so
today I'm going to be using the Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani palette so firstly
I'm just going to be reaching for danger
which is this one here and I'm going to
be applying or wash of this shadow all
over the lid using my is a Weaver luxe
crease brush
next I'm reaching for 1987 which is this
one here and I'm just going to be kind
of running that through the crease and
very lightly I'm then reaching for this
flat brush it buys the weaver and this
is the luck smoky shader and I'm
applying the 1987 shadow on the lower
lash line just to kind of tie the whole
look together and lastly for the eyes
I'm going to be reaching for this like
brown chestnut burgundy kind of shade
and it's called serious I think I'm
taking that one rosy we've a crease
brush and very very lightly picking this
up we don't want a lot of this at all
and then really lightly I'm just going
to start blending that into the crease
so this is what it should look like
quite subtle and you kind of blend that
out even further I'm returning back to
the first shade we put down this is
danger and I'm picking that shadow up
again on the same brush and I'm just
kind of blending out any harsh edges
that we may have come across with this
darker color the line of that GG's got
in this makeup is a cat line so today
I'm going to be using at the L'Oreal
super liner in perfect slim this is such
a great liner for beginners so bear with
me you guys I'm going to hold my breath
for like the next two minutes to
basically not mess this up all the
tension the tension this is where it
could go so horribly wrong so although I
really like how this looks I'm actually
going to go in with another eyeliner and
basically trace along this one and I'm
using the Sigma ace line and this is a
really really pigmented liquid liner so
I'm going to be using that it's
sometimes good to trace your line with a
felt tip liner and then go over with a
liquid liner because liquid liner is
like so to a permanent and if you ruin
this on your first go there's like no
way of fixing it without ruining your
shadow
are they even all right now for mascara
I'm going to easing the Loreal fog
slasher scoped this is such a good
mascara you guys and by the way you guys
do you know any good lash curlers
because every lash curler used in the
past just doesn't work for me I don't
know what it is with my lashes but
they're just so dead straight they never
come up and it literally looks like I've
got no lashes so this is the eye look
done I feel like it's quite a natural
look that you guys probably like our
Board of and see a lot on my channel
anyway I feel like the whole look really
comes together with the lip and I'm not
sure what lip she's actually wearing in
this picture but I feel like a really
close shade to her lipstick is actually
stoned by Mac because this is quite a
dark lip shade I'm going to be lining my
lips first because I don't actually have
a brown lip planner I'm just going to be
using a brow pencil and this is the
Superliner brow artist by L'Oreal I
sharpened it last night I'm pretty happy
with it do you guys ever like forget to
sharpen your pencil and then you try to
use it until you're literally rubbing
the wood into your lip I do that so
often so I'm just going to be over
lining my top lip slightly because Gigi
has really full nice lip and my top lip
is quite small looks like I've got
mustache and then I'm just going in with
my Mac's stone over the top oh I almost
forgot a highlighter for highlight I'm
going to be using the sleek makeup
palette and this is the Solstice
highlights out so just applying that on
the cheekbone very very lightly and then
just blending it out so this is the
final look I hope you guys like it if
