hello everyone welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys all well so as
you guys can tell I'm doing another
Halloween makeup tutorial today and I'm
going to be doing this look here which
is the half school and exposed spine
makeup look this look is so so quite I
think it's one of my favorite looks for
Halloween and I'm absolutely in love
with these circle lenses I'm gonna link
them down below where I got these from
because these are so so creepy just look
at them if you guys have been around
here since last year you all know that
I've already done a half skull look as
well as a neck tutorial like this but
without the spine so I'll leave both of
those down below if you guys want to see
a different variation of this look let's
see I'm going to be doing a slightly
different one I'm pairing the two looks
together and I'm doing a slightly
different sculpt this time also in my
last year's hovering head tutorial you
guys have been asking me how you would
wear this look outside when you
obviously don't have a black backdrop
like this at all times so if you guys
want to let us look out you can always
wear a black hoodie or a hooded cape and
your work just the same plus where you
trick-or-treating at night I don't think
people are exactly gonna really observe
your neck area and it's also dark
anyways so I think it's going to look
really great you guys enjoyed this video
please be sure to give a huge thumbs up
and subscribe if you're new and without
further ado let's jump right into the
video so to be in the slick I'm firstly
putting in my circle lenses and these
are the ones from fancy-dress comet I'll
leave them down below they are so so
creepy so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to take a black felt tip
liner and basically just mark out the
design of my half skull onto my face so
that I know where my positives and
negatives are going to be there isn't
really a best way to explain what I'm
doing here so if we just carefully
observe where I'm placing my markings I
think that's the best way to replicate
this look so I've basically marked out
the hollows of my jaw and where my teeth
are going to be and then I'm basically
filling in the positive space with a
white face paint from snazaroo I applied
the white face then with a sponge rather
than a face brush because I want the
most even and flawless base I'm then
going back in with my black liner and
I'm basically just going over any of the
lines that may have gotten a little bit
blurry and once I'm happy with their
opacity I'm going to go in and draw out
my teeth so for this you just want to
create some vertical lines over the
Karia and make sure the teeth are
getting a little bit thinner as you get
to each side of the face this will
create the illusion of the teeth being a
little bit more 3-dimensional and almost
like they curve to the back of the jaw
once that's done I'm going to fill in
the hollow part of the jaw with some
black face pain and going around the
teeth to emphasize them I'm then going
in with some white face paint and I'm
going over the teeth just to define them
a little bit more and create some
highlight now I'm going to create a
little bit more depth with shading the
teeth using a gray shadow so you want to
shade the insides of the hollows of the
teeth as well as the sides of my face
and this will again just create that
illusion of a 3-dimensional face now I'm
returning back to the highlight using my
white face paint and I'm just basically
going over any areas that I feel like
are a little bit flat
I feel like highlighting with white face
paint is definitely the finishing touch
and definitely makes the whole look look
way more realistic I'm now going to move
on to the neck and here I'm just drawing
the disks of the vertebrae now I'm not a
genius in anatomy so I think this is
actually correct but I think this is
actually how a spine looks so just do
whatever you like doesn't have to be a
hundred percent correct I'm then filling
in the rest of my neck with black and
also the inner part of my neck where we
want it to look hollow I'm then reaching
for some white facepaint I'm painting
over the spine as well as the edges of
my drawn on neck the higher on the neck
is definitely what's going to make the
look appear much more three-dimensional
and realistic this is an illusion so
it's kind of like a trick of the eye so
I think the highlight and the shading is
very important I'm then going in with
some black face paint into the spine and
also shading it with some great I shadow
don't forget to add some highlight to
finish off the spine and that is the
whole look complete
so that is the end of the video I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and found this
tutorial helpful if you guys happen to
recreate this look please be sure to tag

this in so much fun and I'm sure it's
going to turn some heads on Halloween
