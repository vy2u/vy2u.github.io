makeup tutorial and this time I'm doing
a half skull half peeled up skin type of
look I saw this idea over on next

version I think so
I decided to do a skeleton version this
video is actually in collaboration with

very affordable and really easy to
create actually a giveaway involved in

announcement will be made but I'll have
all the information that you need to
know about the giveaway in the
description listed as well but that is
enough rambling without further ado and
let's get on into the tutorial thanks I
start off the look I'm gonna be using my
perfect color foundation from Primark
and just applying that all over my face
for an even a complexion and then just
going to blend this into my skin with my
blending brush moving on I'm gonna be
taking my perfect color liquid concealer
and just applying this underneath and on
top of my eyelids as a nice little
primer for any eyeshadow that we may be
putting on top it's also just gonna
cancel out any of the darkness from
underneath our eyes next up I'm gonna
take the contour kit and using the
middle shade from this I'm just going to
contour my right cheek bone the next
step is to create the split of the skin
and the skull so we're gonna take a thin
black liner and just outline the shape
of where we want the fake skin to kind
of overlap the skull so I'm just going
in an oval shape quite high above my
brow bone then going down in the
of my nose and then kind of creating
like a drooping effect of the skin once
that's done I'm gonna take the primer
kiss of death Halloween kit and I'm
gonna take the white pin from this I'm
gonna apply this white paint over on the
side of that the skull is going to be on
so the bottom half of my face in this
case this face paint is actually really
good it's very opaque in color it's
really easy to blend and to apply once
that's done I'm going to take the fright
Club pencils and I'm gonna take the
white pencil and just use this in any
edges that my Beauty Blender couldn't
really reach so I'm just gonna trace
along the line where we made the outline
of the skin and just really blend this
in with the Beauty Blender afterwards
next what you want to do is just take a
black liner and really outline where
your eye is going to be it's really good
to look at a reference picture of a
skull whilst doing this and then just
gonna reach back to the fright Club
pencils and using the black one I'm just
going to fill in the whole portion of
the eye to make it look really hollowed
out and then returning back to my thin
black liner and just doing a little bit
of detail work above the eye and also
moving on to the nose so for the nose
shape you want to be as creative as you
want to be I'm just taking inspiration
from a real skull and just putting my
little twist on it to make it look a
little bit more cute and again once my
outline is finished I'm just gonna fill
this in again with the thick black
pencil moving on to the rest of my face
I'm gonna create the whole eyes of my
cheekbones now so for this I'm just
creating a curvy line along my cheekbone
really following at the hollow of it and
then curling it out downwards and then
continuing that same curve onto the
bottom of my jaw line once that's done
you want to really fill that black in
and make it as opaque as possible and
then you also just want to shade this
out so I'm just creating little short
strokes which I'm then gonna blend out
with my Beauty Blender to really get
that nice transition color this was a
really easy way of shading to make the
skull look even more realistic but
because the paint's are so easily
blendable this was super super easy to
create using that same black crayon I'm
just gonna go over the edges to give it
even more depth now to really to find
the edges and make them really sharp and
crisp I'm just going over the edges with
the black thin liner next up we're gonna
move on to the teeth so for this I'm
just creating little u-shape to just
outline the shape of the teeth you don't
have to be very neat with this because
we are going to be fixing this up later
once you get to the other side of your
face you just want to create the same
hollow shape that you created on the
left side you want to try and get this
to match as symmetrically as possible
but it doesn't have to be perfect and no
skull shape is exactly symmetrical and
now just continuing to outline the teeth
all the way into the other side of the
face and also doing the bottom teeth as
well once you have finished outlining
the teeth you can reach for the black
paint and just really start defining at
the teeth with this so what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna apply this over the
line where my mouth opens and also just
apply this black in between any of the
teeth really blending and stretching
this outwards this is gonna give the
illusion of a lot of dimension and make
the shape of the teeth look much more 3d
once I finish doing that I'm taking
whatever is left on the brush and really
just outlining the rest of the skull
adding even more detail to make it look
more 3d rather than so flat I'm just
going around the eyes creating some
lines and just a lot of depth in those
areas and once I'm finished with that
I'm just gonna reach for the white
crayon and I'm just really going over
the teeth to give them more dimension
and just kind of bring them back to life
if I may because at the moment they're
very flat and have no dimension at all
so just adding a smidge of white over
the teeth will really make a difference
if you have accidentally gone over any
of the black lines of the teeth you can
easily go back in and fix that up to
make them more sharper next I'm taking
the same black liner and just really
adding even more depth to the actual
hollow parts of the jaw so what I'm
doing is I'm just creating little singe
strokes with the liner to serve as
shading next up I'm taking the black
crayon and just going over the outline
underneath where the skin portion is
this is going to make the skull look as
if it's underneath of the skin rather
than on top once that's done I'm just
gonna blend this out with a little
precision brush to blend into the rest
of the skull and lastly for the
finishing touches of the skull I'm just
going in with a black fin liner and I'm
just really going over any of the
shading to add even more definition I
think this really gives this skull a lot
of character and more detailing so don't
be afraid to go all out and just add
random strokes here and there now moving
on to the skin portion I'm going in it
with the contour kit and I'm going in
with the darkest shade from the contour
kit and I'm just adding this really
long line adjacent to the one that we've
already created this is going to make
the skin look as if it's folded over the
trick to making this look more realistic
is adding an initial layer of brown and
then really building up that pigment and
that darkness over time now to make the
fold of the skin looks like it's
actually 3-dimensional you want to add a
smidgen of white paint in between the
black and the brown line now to finish
off the eye I'm gonna use my insta go
iridescent highlighter as an eye shadow
because it's such a beautiful color and
I'm just going to apply this all over
the lid and blend this out into the
crease with one of the brown shadows
from the contour kit and then gonna
finish this off with a very thick black
liner and apply the iconic mascara to my
top and bottom lashes and now to finish
off the look I'm gonna take these sultry
false eyelashes and just apply this to
one of the eyes and this is the finished
Halloween makeup tutorial I think this
look turned out super cool it was so
easy to create and again it's so
affordable because I used all prime up
makeup I think this makeup looks
exceptionally cool when you pop your
finger here and here cuz it almost looks
like you're actually peeling up your
skin let me know why guys think of this
makeup I found it so much fun to create
this look and I hope you guys enjoy it
