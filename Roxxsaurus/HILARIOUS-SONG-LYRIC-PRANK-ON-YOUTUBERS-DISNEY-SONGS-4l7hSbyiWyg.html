channel I hope you guys are well so
today I'm going to be doing at the most
original video that you have ever seen
on YouTube just kidding this is the song
lyric cram video you guys have probably
seen this all over YouTube it's like a
craze right now on the internet and I
think it's gonna be like a fad like
Harlem shake or something like that so
I've already done this video once I did
a prank on my boyfriend I'll link that
in the eye this time I thought it would
take it a step further and do this prank
on my youtuber friends so there's a lot
of different youtubers that I have in my
contacts
some I'm closer with than others so the
ones that I'm not too close with yet
might take it a little bit weird and I'm
probably gonna ruin whatever
relationship I have with them so far so
yeah wish me luck so I'm thinking what
better way to kick start this video than
messaging Safran Barca with the lyrics
of you've got a friend in me from Toy
Story this Apple is currently in America
so I don't know if she'll actually reply
to me but we'll see ok so here I go with
the first lyric I mean I'm hoping mercy
she was won't catch on to this too quick
but I think she might because she's
already done this oh my gosh excited
she's already done this on her boyfriend
and she's already done this on her
channel so she might already clock on
that it's a prank ok she put you've got
a friend in me back and she's like
already clocked on cuz like that song is
so iconic I think anyone will let you
just know that it's from Toy Story the
worst bit about this video is like
waiting on people to reply like she
replied really quickly for the first
time but now I'm probably gonna wait
like 20 minutes she was just like you've
got a friend in me winky face that's it
I'm out see ya if I've got a friend in
you why do you no reply let me move on
to the next person and maybe she'll
reply in between ok who surely text now
I think I'm gonna go with lela lela is
actually a pretty busy person so I don't
know if she'll reply but let's test our
luck ok so I'm going to hit Layla with
the lyrics from Pocahontas at colors of
the wind
I have a feeling she's seen this movie
and if she hasn't
then Leila I don't know if I wanna be
friends with you I'm hoping that she
will read this pretty quick the waiting
game begins oh she's ready oh my gosh
she's read it
she's pooped um no laughing face laughs
and face what is it question mark next
lyric has been sent she's gonna be like
Roxie just you wait wait oh you're gonna
no no I didn't you caught on I think
just call chief oh you are so pranking
me do you guessed it pretty quick but
she she was fooled for the first one Oh
is she typing now either you are having
an office breaks out or you are pranking
both meanwhile saffron has replied and
she said you just remember what your old
pal said she is so cool I'm gonna try
and prank marks yeah but she is
currently in Italy so I don't think she
will actually reply but it's worth a try
okay so for multi I'm just going to do
it the iconic part of your world by
Little Mermaid look at this stuff isn't
it me she doesn't reply she's gonna be
like you're such a fool oh she's
replying oh my god Japan I don't see
anything wouldn't you think my
collections complete she's typing she's
typing I think I know what you are doing
I'm just gonna hit home of the next
lyric and see what she says hey she said
Roxie Roxie Roxie
she's like a picture of my Ange said my
became a ghost because of it oh just
thank you damn it she calls so quick I
will get your marks here you just wait
okay you can owe prank next okay I'm
going to try and do freddy and see if
she replies I'm gonna do let it go on
high but I'm not going to start the
beginning I'm gonna like kind of slide
it through to the next verse it's funny
how some distance makes everything seem
small oh my god this just made me
realize you are actually Elsa in real
how did she get it from that like Freddy
you must be like a big frozen fan Freddy
said ha some lyric prank role passing
Roxie I knew every word to every Disney
song well although at first I was like
what ha ha I'm gonna try and do Alexa
now I don't know if she replied cuz
obviously she's from America and there's
quite a time difference but hopefully
she will Alexa I hope the video turns
out good hey everyone subscribe to Roxy
camber tried you hello and see if it
works it's funny how some distance makes
everything seem small still waiting
Nietzsche goes away too busy how some
time-off guys have some time off
helen / Elsa is there you right I'm
gonna try and do Jodi from just Joe's
Joe just who's this I don't think she
has my phone safe like I think I got her
number but she never got mine so I'm
gonna try in them take advantage of this
I just had the best idea I'm gonna prank
her but not with sore legs I'm gonna
make it seem like I'm her biggest fan
and I got her number online oh my god
this is so bad like this is really evil
this is so so evil but I wanna know what
she's gonna reply today I think she's
gonna hate me after this
I'm so sorry Jodi the tension is killing
me right but please reply I'm sorry it's
such a needy fan how did you get my
number
should I just go along with our shite
elevates me I'm too scared alone think
of YouTube let's go along I got on this
website that leaks YouTube numbers and
thought I'd try is it really you
you guys she's not replying anymore I
think she actually genuinely believes
that okay I'm just gonna tell her as me
because I feel too mean just typing I
was so scared for a minute that haha yes
oh hey YouTube let's try and do Rachael
Leary and see if she replies oh she's
typing let's see if she catches on or if
she just thinks that I'm a crazy person
maybe wife oh she knows I don't like
that prank on another youtuber nice try
okay one last person nervous to be done
is Victoria my silver hair twinny the
lyrics have been sent shots have been
fired
