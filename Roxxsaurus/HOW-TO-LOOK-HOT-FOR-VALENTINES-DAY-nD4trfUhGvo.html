guys oh wow this Valentine's Day is
approaching so quickly I thought I would
film a video kind of based around how to
look good and feel your best at
Valentines Day even if you don't have a
significant other to celebrate
Valentine's Day with this year that was
not enough to actual Valentine's Day is
about loving yourself just as much as
loving other people so if any of you
don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend at
Valentines Day this year don't worry
take this day as like a little pamper
day to kind of have an excuse to really
treat yourself and make yourself feel
the best that you can but in the video
I'm going to show you guidelines a
little tips and tricks and things that I
do to make myself look a little bit
better if you don't like to see that
then you are in the right place anything
over viewing this video make sure you
give a thumbs up just down below and
also subscribe if you are brand new
bye you guys wanna see how to achieve at
this lens I'll include a makeup line
also to output options as well as how I
give my hair then just keep on watching
okay so first I'm gonna start with my I
are gonna be creating quite a neutral
warm toned eyeshadow line a long time at
neutral I love it perfect for every skin
tone and every eye color and it's really
easy to do as well so I love using at my
next warm neutral palette for this week
are the most gorgeous shades in here and
they're really buttery creamy and it's
also drugstore which makes it really
affordable because I'm going to take
this one neutral shadow and I'm gonna
blend it into my crease
I got a medium the transition color in
your crease is going to make your life
so much easier when creating a smokey
eye because it makes it so much easier
to blend all the colors together never I
take a slightly darker shadow which is
this one and it's like a nice warm
neutral shadow once again but it's a
little bit darker than our transition
color I'm going to take this on brush
and apply this into the Alpha B of my
eyelid by side don't worry if your
eyeshadow gets really messy like this
because we're going to clean up at the
end
once the other loaded your item is
really well you can then take a
highlight color and this is the color
we're going to pop onto the center of on
this and that is what's going to really
cool the look together and finish our so
today I'm going to be asking for this
really nice gold and pigmented eyeshadow
and on a passing brush understand I'm
going to apply this into the center of
my eyelid this is going to add a nice
pop of color and highlight to the eyelid
while still making it really wearable so
that was a really easy three-step way to
create a really nice smoky eye but now
to really finish it off you just want to
take a q-tip and some makeup remover
don't help the q-tip and clean up the
edge of your eyeshadow and just like
that you got yourself a really nice
crisp shape to your eyeshadow look which
you cannot read over the eyeliner
mascara I'm asking to start off with a
mascara primer this one is my urban
decay called it's super version thicker
longer and stronger lash file this is
honestly the holy grail of mascara is
that no one ever seemed to talk about I
hardly think that mascara primer should
be more common because they really do
make a difference for your eyelashes so
I'm going to put a coat of this onto my
lashes before applying at my sealer
mascara and lastly to finish off the
market I'm going to be using this great
mass mascara by Maybelline it for my
bottom lashes because the wand is very
small and it's just perfect for all
those tiny little lashes and lastly to
finish off the eyes I'm going to use my
Avon and mirror shine crayons to really
exercise and highlight in the corners of
my eyes I feel like this makes you look
so much more weight and it ruins a lot
of attention to your eyes
next up in contouring highlight this is
a fair thing you just cannot get
altering really emphasizes and underlies
all of your best features on your face
while highlighting brings back that
helping it and glow to your face so in
the contour i'm going to take my Too
Faced and milk chocolate Soleil bronzer
in and out why this onto the
circumference of my face must be
focusing on my cheekbone I'm just
blending this in with circular motions
like so and even taking it up to the
temples and my forehead I'm also going
to read for us
copyright and contour my nose a little
bit so I'm just taking that information
the tip of my nose to make it appear
there's a bit more cooler and cylinder
and now I'm doing another highlight so
just so you guys know my top three
favorite highlights at the moment is
this one here which is new makeup
forever highlighter and this is e pro
mic fusion it's the most beautiful cool
toes highlighter but then what I'm
obsessed with at the moment is the rodeo
highlighter this is the Instagram
compact highlighting powder zero to any
I just want to quite a cool turn one
it's so beautiful and that's before our
affordable highlight I'm really still
loving the sleek softest highlighter and
in here you get a whole set as a few
different shade with different
undertones which is perfect if you are a
beginner and you're just trying out
highlighters so it wasn't a flirt I'm
going to pick if you make a proto one
which is this really gorgeous cool to
and shade and I'm going to apply this
onto my cheekbones and the tip of my
nose for a really nice glowing highlight
lastly to finish off this look I'm going
to go for a bright red lip feel like a
lot of you may be scared if you want a
red lip but trust me if you just give it
a try you're going to look great all you
have to do is to find the right tone of
color for your skin tone very like this
one here which is be noting map by Too
Faced because it's got a cool undertone
meaning that it sort of makes your teeth
look really white and also it's really
wearable and the best thing about this
is that it's a liquid lipstick which
means it's super wearable it last for
ages meaning is kiss proof we're just
perfect for Valentine's Day and if you
follow my Instagram you'll know that I
always rock this one which is cool now
by Too Faced and it's also the melted
matte liquid lipstick on the face was
just such a wearable everyday color any
are ready for a red alert just yet you
can always rock the new one so that I
can finish I'm now going to be onto my
hair first of all I'm going to add some
volume to my roots just by using if you
dry hump you by collapse I'm going to
spritz them into my roots and fluff it
up a little bit I'm going in your hand
makes so much different so now that I've
got that really nice fluffy roots I'm
now going to
I had with my coming one the one I'm
using is the Remington one really hook
it I'm going to show you guys a really
cool trick if you want to curl your hair
really quickly and you are in a ranch
what you have to do is close up your
hair in a high ponytail and just cut all
the different strands of your hair in
the ponytail but we just paint so much
with that and its really good if you
have a lot of hair and if you're in a
rush and once you cover all the strands
we have to do Institute let your hair
and your hair should be nice and curly
so now the hair makes the finish I
thought I would show you guys at two
different outfit options for Valentine's
Day in case you guys have wanted some
inspiration so the first outfit is quite
a casual yet classy one because the
jeans are very wearable for everyday
whilst the top is a little bit more on
the dressy side due to its really nice
high neckline
I absolutely love this cup and I think
it goes perfectly with the jeans the top
is from ASOS and the jeans are from
pretty little thing as well as the shoes
I feel like all the muted colors work
really perfectly together and now outfit
you is slightly more different one this
is a little bit more dressy due to the
corset that is layered on top of the
simple white dress and this dress paired
with summit knee-high boots is a really
nice touch the whole outfit is from ASOS
