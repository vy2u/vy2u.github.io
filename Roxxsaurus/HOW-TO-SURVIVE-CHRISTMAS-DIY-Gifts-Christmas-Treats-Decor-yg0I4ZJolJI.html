guys are doing this super well too today
I actually have a really exciting video
I think I say that every single time but
honestly this video is pretty exciting
so today I thought I would film a kind
of like how to survive Christmas kind of
video and I know Christmas can be super
stressful especially when it comes to
buying presents for people then just
overall the Christmas period it's super
fun and I love this so much but it can
get a little bit stressful sometimes
today I'm going to show you guys a few
like DIYs and like a little gift guide
after this video I promise you guys will
be sorted for Christmas if you're gonna
enjoy this video please smash that huge
thumbs up just down below and also
subscribe I also have a blog channel
which I'm currently doing vlogmas on
something personal every single day I'll
leave in the little eye in the corner so
you guys can click that and check it out
I've been loving vlogging recently like
I think I might make it like a day you
think for a little while I'll see how it
goes but let me know if you guys would
like to see that also I'm having a
really exciting Christmas giveaway which
I'll talk about a little bit at the end
of this video so make sure you guys stay
till then if you want to see what to win
and how to win but let's jump right into
the video then the first a gift idea is
getting someone that like bath stuff or
like toiletries and I think everyone
will appreciate this because let's be
honest it just means that that person
doesn't have to go out and get it
themselves so the body shop have the
most amazing set of like Bath stuff and
this one in particular is my favorite
it's the iconic collection and I
definitely agree that these products are
my clinic as the title says so as you
open it up these are all the products
that you get in size because they may be
more but basically this thing is huge
and these are some of their like
bestseller products I love all of these
products so much so I definitely think
that this would make a perfect gift for
a bottle of the next if idea is candles
or room sprays now I honestly
don't think you can go wrong with this I
don't know personally anyone who doesn't
like handles even if they've got a
massive candle burner I think they still
look amazing in someone's home so I have
this little one here that's got like a
copper lid and it says a belief and this
is from TK Maxx and then I also have
this room spray which I've briefly talks
about on my vlog Channel and this is the
bath Houma London just cookies room
spray this literally smells like
Christmas it's it's literally Christmas
in a bottle it just smells so good if
you guys love cookies you definitely
love this and this is also from TK Maxx
the next gift idea is makeup benefit
definitely have with the cutest little
sets of makeup such as this one which is
the blushing babe real blushing
blockbuster so inside you have all of
their blushes and their hoola bronzer
you also all have actually taken these
two out but you get the eyeliner they're
real eyeliner and the little mascara
tester as well as a little version of
the Watts up highlighter this comes in
such cheap packaging and I think any
girl would appreciate this as a gift
Nitz also have some really cute like
stocking fillers so this one here is a
set of that very soft matte lip creams
and these other colors they just look so
so cool I would love to receive one of
these for Christmas and they also have
like a little mini NYX beauty school
dropout 101 which is like a little
eyeshadow palette and I think it's not
all the colors that you would ever need
for a smoky eye but for those of you who
are looking at your bank account that
slash your wallet and you're thinking
wow I am broke I've got you guys as well
and I've got some DIY gift ideas for you
guys too food is always a winner like
literally give me food and I'll be happy
so DIY cookies is an amazing gift and if
you guys can't bake that's totally fine
I can't bake as well so I've got you on
that as well I think Han decorated
cookies are like the perfect holiday
gift for literally anyone and if you are
a master at baking that's perfect but
even if you
don't worry I'm not either you can buy
ready-made cookies and just decorate
those maybe they're cookies like super
Christmasy you can even make them themed
with their favorite like movie or show
so I'm actually making some Minnie Mouse
inspired ones by attaching a mini jammie
Dodgers to digestives using a toothpick
I actually don't have the clips to show
this but that's basically what I did and
then I just covered them in icing and I
did some really cute patterns and design
and made them look or really Christmassy
the next one is even more simple so all
you have to do is go to the store and
pick out the person you're gifting this
for like their favorite sweets or candy
you're also going to need some candy
canes a chocolate Santa and then you
just want to put it all together and
today I've got yourself a sledge made
out of sweet what a perfect gift the
next gift idea is getting someone a DIY
iPhone case I feel like an iPhone case
is something that everyone needs so I
thought that making your own one would
be such a cute idea and literally all
you need is a clear phone case some hot
glue and some glitter so firstly I'm
drawing out my pattern with the glue and
quickly applying the glitter so that the
glue does not dry I then tap off the
excess glitter and voila that is your
phone case finished the next gift idea
is a tumblr inspired photo frame so all
you need for this is a frame now I have
this one that was actually a cork board
I'm then taking some white string and
attaching that to the back of the frame
I'm then taking some craft Clips these
are really cute miniature ones and I'm
just attaching my Polaroids to the
string to finish off the frame I'm just
adding some checkered ribbon and
applying that with some hot glue and
that is the photo frame finish this is
such a cute idea this is super
affordable and easy to make and you can
attach some really cute photos of you
and your friends
next we're moving on to you at DIY decor
now this one is quite quirky and quite
unique so what you need for this is some
colored balloons and some plastic or
paper cups
so I'm attaching the cups onto the
balloon with some sellotape and then
attaching all of the balloons onto a
piece of string now once it's finished
it looks something like this it
literally looks so cute because it looks
like giant Christmas lights this next
one I found on Pinterest and I thought
it was super easy and cute so what you
need is an electric tea light candle and
a sharpie so firstly you want to draw
some eyes and a mouth onto the tea light
candle then you want to cut out a hat
shape out of a piece of cardboard and
then stick that on and lastly you want
to finish that off over a ribbon this is
such a cute and easy ornament idea for
the tree moving on to DIY treats I'm
taking some white icing and placing that
over digestive biscuits I'm then topping
that off with some white marshmallows
and adding some nose and eyes out of
icing onto the marshmallow and here we
are really cute melted snowmen biscuit
trees follow this next one you're gonna
need some pretzel sticks some
marshmallows an Oreo some Reese's minis
and also some colored icing the first
thing I'm doing is I'm threading my
marshmallows onto my pretzel stick and
basically just drawing a snowman design
with my icing I'm not slipping that off
of an Oreo and Reese's hat this is
honestly my favorite Christmas DIY tree
for this next one you are taking one
marshmallow onto your pretzel stick and
dipping that in some chocolates
I'm then breaking a mini pretzel in half
and using that as antlers for our
reindeers next I'm just adding a red
nose with some icing and also eyes with
black icing to finish that off you can
add some ribbon and those are your
reindeer marshmallow treats finished
this last DIY tree is super simple to
make what you want to do is cut off the
top of the strawberry and then fill the
space with some whipped cream and then
putting the top of the strawberry back
on and drawing some eyes with black
icing to finish it off you can add some
pretzel sticks and add some whipped
cream onto the tip of the strawberry not
only are they really cute but they're
also the healthiest tree out of all of
these so that was all for this video I
