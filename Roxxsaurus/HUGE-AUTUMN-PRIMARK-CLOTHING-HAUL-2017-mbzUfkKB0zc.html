rambling without further ado let's get
on into the hall where I literally have
this huge Primark bag it's packed full
of clothes that I'm about to show you
which I'm so excited for ok so the first
thing I actually picked up is this
little turtleneck kind of jumper and the
color is so so pretty it's like a dusky
kind of pink I guess this is in size 8
and I actually picked this up for 6
pounds which I feel like it's a really
good price like not bad at all and it's
like rare but it's really long you can
tuck it into jeans and I don't know like
since autumn is kind of on its way I'm
like yes warm clothes like autumn colors
I just love everything about autumn so I
got very excited and carried away the
next kind of like autumnal sort of item
that I got is and this little beanie and
I absolutely loved the color of it this
was only 2 pounds oh my god
and it's like again ribbed it's like a
really pretty mustard color I'll
obviously be wearing it with a middle
party so this is what it kind of looks
like on ok maybe not like that wait wait
I'm not wearing this right is this how
you wear it I never know how to wear
beanies they always make my head look
kind of like a floppy bag of poop I
don't know like I don't know it just
doesn't look that
and what is this what is like this what
do you do with this bear I don't know
tell me if you guys think that this
looks good because I really don't know
how to wear hats the next thing I picked
up is a scarf I told you guys I just
couldn't help myself with the like
autumn clothes so I actually had a scarf
like this last year and I lost it
and I just I loved it like I love red
tartan it just reminds me so much of
winter in autumn so I had to pick one up
this year and this was six pounds the
next item that I picked up is actually
from the like Disney / Harry Potter
section and I just couldn't leave this
behind
so I actually picked this up in a size
14 by accident but it's a Harry Potter
t-shirt it's just plain why it's a
little bit big but I felt like I could
just wear this as pajamas is like a long
pajama kind of dress and this would fit
me fine so I just love Harry Potter you
guys it's so cool that they have like
Harry Potter and Disney stuff in Primark
I really really rate that this was six
pounds which I feel like again it's a
bargain
next item is another jumper and at this
one I actually fell in love with it's so
pretty
this is what it looks like it's like a
dark purple II kind of grey color and I
love the fact that it has this choker
detailing so wore like a white version
of this the other day and I got so many
compliments and I absolutely love this
style of like tops so this is just
perfect and I've got this in a size s
how much was this actually this was ten
pounds so not bad not bad at all I also
picked up this bright like orange e /
yellowy hoodie and this is actually a
size 8 and I got this for 7 pounds I
just felt like hoodies are just a must
to have an award robe like I wear
hoodies all around the house and they're
just so comfy and this one is slightly
cropped as well which makes it perfect
to wear with like jeans or high-waisted
things and I just really loved the color
so I had to get it oh my god this next
thing is the cutest thing I've ever seen
in the whole Primark and it's these
little slippers Oh
look at them they're like little bunnies
I love them so much that's so precious
and they're so like nice and fluffy and
just so really cozy so these were only
four pounds so again absolute bargain
and they look so cute by the way if I
sound a bit nasally it's because I've
got hay fever and I don't know every
time I wake up I always have a block
nose and it's so annoying the next item
that I picked up is another jumper now
this one oh my god can we just literally
this jumper is the simplest jumper ever
but it's so soft English she feels like
a teddy bear like I'm not even kidding
if you guys go into Primark you need to
feel this because it's just so like soft
and ah wait I don't want to get
foundation on actually but yeah it's so
so nice so soft and this is what it
looks like again it's kind of cropped a
little bit maybe yeah I really like it I
love the fact that it's got these like
long ribbed detailing around like the
cups of the sleeves and also the bottom
of the jumper just gives it like a
little bit of you know something
standard 7 pairs of socks cuz why not oh
I remember getting this actually this is
like a little dungaree dress and it's
denim and it's black and it's quite
short and I tried this on in store and
it actually fit me really well so I had
to get this and it's got little pockets
as well which is so nice so this was
actually this is a size 6 which is like
smaller than what I usually purchase but
I felt like on a dungaree dress it will
just fit me fine because things like
this are always a little bit too big for
me whenever I buy them so I thought ok
I'm gonna like size down I actually
can't remember how much this was because
a tag has been pulled off but I'm pretty
sure this was like 10 12 pounds
something like that so in my last fall I
actually picked up this pair of like
lace-up jeans that were like beige and I
loved them so much but they actually us
like starting to sell out of them
they're not going to be coming back into
stock so whilst I saw this black pair
which is literally the same pair but in
black I just had to pick it up and this
was actually like the last pair like
ever
I was like no there really wanted to get
some for my mum like the beige pair but
they didn't have it in stock so I was so
annoyed but I got myself a pair of the
black ones hooray oh and these ones were
how much way you they were 13 pounds I
got myself another cute little beanie
enormous hit myself in the face but this
was three pounds so one pound more than
the other one and it's like baby pink
and I love it and I'm gonna put it on
now but it's not gonna look very good
this one looks a little bit better than
the last one obviously I wouldn't have
my hair like this but I think it's
pretty cute I only got this little
Bardot off the shoulder kind of top um
so it's just like black ripped kind of
plain but on the actual shoulders it has
like this lace-up what's the best way to
show you this it has like this lace-up
kind of thing on the shoulders like just
down here and I thought this was really
cute it's just really simple simple
black tee but it had something a little
bit like you know sassy in there and
this was at six pounds and then got
myself a little choker necklace with an
O and you guys see can you guys see
there we go
and this was only two pounds and I
thought it was a bargain and it comes
with actually two necklaces not just the
art it also comes with like a tiny gold
one at the bottom now moving on to my
favorite part the home decor home decor
has been so nice in Primark lately and
so the first thing I actually picked up
is isn't really home decor but it's like
a home item and it's an ice tray that
literally is shaped like Mickey Mouse oh
my goodness this was three pounds and I
literally pick this up on a whim I was
like ice cubes Mickey Mouse it just
makes sense it just I just had to get it
the next thing I got is this cute little
candle which is a baby pink at the
bottom and then rose gold at the top and
it's pretty much like a tea light candle
holder this was four pounds and I
absolutely loved the aesthetic of this
like it fits so perfectly downstairs in
my living room and so I just had to get
it I also got this little vars which is
kind of like marble s like it's I don't
know it
like it's a marble print and I can't
remember how much this was I'm pretty
sure it was like 250 but I don't know
it's just really cute really simple I'm
probably gonna put a little flower
inside or something this thing I picked
up from the whole section is this and
this is so pretty and literally looks
like something you could buy from Urban
Outfitters or TK Maxx or somewhere like
that this is actually a fake little plan
it's just made out of plastic but I love
the crescent moon that's made out of
like this coppery kind of metal material
yeah it's just really really pretty if
it's perfectly on my shelf downstairs
and the last thing I got is this and
this is a little clock I'm holding it
the wrong way up there we go it's just a
little clock that has like a marble kind
of inner part and then it also has this
copper edging which I absolutely love
like so many things in my living room a
copper so I just I couldn't leave this
behind and that is all for my Primark
