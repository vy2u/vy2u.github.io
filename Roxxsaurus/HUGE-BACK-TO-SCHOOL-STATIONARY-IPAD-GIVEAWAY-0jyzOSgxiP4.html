I'm going to move on to the stationery
hall so I actually picked up this Mickey
Mouse box which I'm going to be shipping
the giveaway in this so you guys can
also keep this little box which is
absolutely adorable and inside I have a
bunch of stationary Regents so so
excited to go through as you guys can
tell I get really excited about
stationery I am so sad okay so the first
thing that I see in this box is this
little cute pencil case or that has
watermelons all over it and I thought
English's their loves adorable thing
ever
I love watermelons and it's just like a
really nice size to just pop a few pens
into the next thing I got are these
spent hoes at pencil so these are
scented colored pencils there are twelve
of them and they smell so good
every single one has like a different
flavors and it's like banana orange
apple strawberry watermelon and my
favorite literally every smell you can
think of oh my god there's even
chocolate I am sure these are going to
be amazing
I'll go with a theme of Mickey Mouse and
Disney I pick up these little scissors
which come up like a Mickey Mouse holder
go like a little sleeve to pop kisses
and to made out of plastic and I just
feel like that it's so cool because it's
like one damage your pencil case if you
carrying these around and it's just like
a so adorable everyone needs scissors so
I got you guys I got you I then got some
print six these are Joe's the glues
about they're all different colors red
blue green and yellow I thought why go
for plain and glue when you can get
colored blue duh I used when I was just
who I always ran out of glue so you've
got four you're caught in and then
picked up another Mickey Mouse a team
thing and this notebook is absolutely
adorable
can we judge it might as well lipstick
this is so adorable and this is what it
looks like inside is just a line note
book and it says Minnie Mouse inside
with a bunch of Minnie Mouse's at the
bottom it's just going to be like a
perfect two and drop down any notes that
you guys may have it for school and yeah
this is what it looks like I have
literally pinch you guys out with the
Mickey Mouse I'm just
I also picked up these little pencils
from Mickey Mouse but five different
ones and they all got like a different
Mickey Mouse kind of pattern then also
got you guys at Summit sharpies so these
are just like a bunch of different
colored sharpies I feel like this is
such an essential for back-to-school
especially when you're like making notes
and doodling - kind of like highlight
specific things that you have to learn
so these are going to be very useful I
then got you guys for different pens
there's like pink red blue and black I
just really like the little design on
them I thought they were really cute so
that is why I picked these up because
let's be honest and no one wants a
boring stationery am i right
oh my god this is another thing that I
like is so happy about that I got and
it's this little shop now there's like a
pig oh thank you another look like so
you just pop your pencil in there and
then you twist this little thing here
and it sharp is your pencil and it looks
like a piggy so cute I'm like
hyperventilating I need to like calm I
don't got you guys a really huge rubber
it says a really big mistake I just felt
like it was really funny so I had to get
it it's probably going to take half of
your pencil case up but oh well I then
got this really cute mini notebook and
it's basically like a chocolate bar and
you see that it kind of looked like a
little bit and off part here and the
notebook itself looks like a chocolate
bar I got you guys four more brothers
you know in case you run out of this
huge one which you probably never well I
thought you guys and these ones here
they look like mini Easter eggs but I
just thought they were really cute and
colorful so there's four of those I got
this at little like boys it's called
sticky memos so inside here you have
like all kinds of different sticky notes
for when you're revising and stuff so I
picked that up as well and the last
thing I got in a set of a crimp in
because I personally love painting and I
feel like if you guys don't have a set
of paint and you definitely share
because it's so much fun to paint even
if you're not the best at it it's just a
really really fun so I thought you guys

you wanted to be a bit more artistic and
that is everything in this box I am so
excited for one of you guys to win this
little box of stationery goodies and

thing I thought I would get you guys an
