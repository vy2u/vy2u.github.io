channel I hope you guys have an awesome
day so far so today as you can see from
the title I'm really excited because I'm
going to be filming a bikini / swimsuit
trying pool I have been purchasing like
way too many bikinis and swimsuits
lately because I'm actually going away
on holiday to ib4 next month I will be
lugging it everyday so make sure you
guys also I subscribe to Rock Sora's
vlog so you guys can keep up with those
vlogs I just looked into my closet and I
realized I have no actual cute swimsuit
or bikini so I thought I have to get
them if you haven't subscribed already
make sure you do because I would love to
have your hair come in join the dinosaur
family we are so close to 2 million
subscribers which is absolutely insane
but without the renew let's get into the
video okay so the first place where our
purchased a few bikinis is actually from
a sauce you guys know I love a sauce so
first up is literally my favorite swim
through that I have purchased and it's
this one here I know it doesn't really
look like much but when it's on it looks
absolutely beautiful I love the pattern
and the color it's like this really nice
and bright blue would like a bunch of
lemons on it this is so so cute the
reason why this one is my favorite
because you can absolutely customize how
this fits like if you want it to fit
really nice and tight and get like a
really nice push up effect you can just
tie this really really close together
like quite tight and then you can kind
of control how it looks this fits so
nicely I especially love the fact that
it has this cutout on the belly because
it really cinches in the waist because
of the way that is kind of like angled I
think it's really flattering for like an
hourglass shape and even if you don't
have any Cubs it kind of like create
curves for you because of the like
optical illusion I guess I just really
really love this like it's so it's so
comfortable and I know I'm definitely
going to be going swimming a lot in this
swimsuit by the way all the links to
these swim fees are going to be down
below so you guys can check them out
yourself if you like any of these so
yeah this one is definitely my favorite
it's so cute that's something that I got
is this one here this is also from ASOS
and it's from the brand monkey so this
is just like a little Bardot kind of
swimsuit have like really nice ruffles
and it's such a nice
it's like a baby pink it fits naturally
like a glove like probably better than a
glove so I really like this one as well
it's just like a really nice material
easy because I haven't been swimming in
this I don't really know how well it
will hold up in an actual swimming pool
because obviously sometimes when you're
swimming your top can kind of come down
and because this is off the shoulders I
don't know how well it will kind of last
you like I don't want you guys to buy
this and have like a boob slip its
Bardot part it's quite stretchy but I
think that once it's on the shoulders it
fits quite tight so I think it should be
okay but just be careful because if you
do go swimming you do not want to have a
boob slip then when the swimming I'm
definitely going to be careful just in
case it does come down so I know that a
lot of bikinis like this tend to do that
but overall I just think it's super cute
like it's going to be so cute for photos
I just can't wait to wear this in a
bikini that I got from ASOS is this
really nice white one and the top is
actually a halter neck style and had
like this really nice lacy trimming I
think this bit absolutely perfect when I
do turn to the side there is a slight
bit of like side boob but it's nothing
major I think this is just really really
cute I think it's going to look really
nice with a tan because it's really
going to accentuate your tan and at the
bottom you could actually pick like
there was a few different variations so
you could pick like a high-waisted
bottom or you could pick like a regular
bottom I went for a high-waisted one
just because you guys know I love
anything high-waisted so this is what
the high-waisted bottoms look like again
they have that lace trimming around the
top and yeah this is really cute like I
think they are quite covering at the
back like I don't really like bikinis
that really show off your butt cheeks a
lot so I think this is definitely like
really nice for people who don't like
that either I then also got another top
to kind of switch it up in case I want
to wear these again and I got this top
here which is just kind of like a
bandeau top and very lazy and rafa knee
so I think it's very flattering for
someone who doesn't have that big of a
chest area so it's kind of going to give
you a bit more boobage but yeah this is
what it looks like I think it's so so
cute
now this nice bikini is actually from
new look so this is the top and I
absolutely love that I think it's so
trendy like with the nude color it's
just a really very pretty color bikini
really like the fact that it's got like
this necklace T kind of detailing at the
top so just kind of sits on your chest
like this it's very different like I
haven't really seen many bikinis like
this so I immediately was really drawn
to air and I think it fits really nicely
and these are the bottoms so again they
have like this really nice detailing on
two of the sides so they have like the
two braiding kind of like not braiding
but like the two string with the beads
on the side which i think is really
really nice
the thing I love about this consume is
this bag that you could get two
different sizes so like you could get a
smaller size for your bust and then a
smaller size and then the bigger size
for your bottom so if you want to make
people who i've miss and matches your
sizes because you may be a little bit
larger or smaller on the top / bottom
then this is perfect because these
actually came separately
this next bikini is also a from new look
and this is the top I love it like I
think it's so Coachella for some reason
like because of the crochet like really
trendy pattern on the on the actual
boobie area so this was at $12.99 for
the top and then the bottom came
separately so this is what the bottom
looks like it's a very simple simple
bottom but if got this really nice like
what he's called castles on the side so
I just think this gives it a little bit
of something extra because you know it's
not just a plain bottom so I think it
works really nicely with the top I would
say that the top is kind of booby and I
didn't really want to try it on for you
guys just because I don't want to like /
you all but basically I think I'm going
to be returning this one although I
really do like it I think it's just a
bit too much for me like I'm not as
comfortable revealing that much of my
chest area so I really really like it I
think I'm going to return it and also I
think the top I got it in a slightly too
big of a size so that's another reason
why I'm going to return it but
apologizing is gorgeous it's such a nice
design and the last thing that I got
from music is actually a bikini cover-up
so I don't actually have a bikini
cover-up side to saw it's probably best
that I get one because it does get a
little bit colder towards the evenings
and I do plan on staying out by the pool
in Ibiza so I thought I would just get
one so I got this white one
and I really like this because it does
have a little like spaghetti strapp but
then it goes off the shoulders and it
has like this really nice lace kind of
trimming around there it's very
lightweight and I don't think this could
be worn as like a actual play suit just
because it is very sheer and I think it
is only meant to be like a bikini
cover-up which that's exactly the
purpose why I got it for ya so this is
basically what it looks like it's quite
short which I like and it's just very
flowy and just you know really easy to
throw on now the last shot that I want
you to pick up a few more bikinis was
actually Primark now prymaat actually
have a lot of good summer stuff in at
the moment so I went and just got a few
like some tunes and bikinis and the
first one that really caught my eye with
this one here it's a bright neon pink
swimsuit and it said mermaids live which
just is made for me like this is perfect
I thought this was so cute because I
love this color at the moment like I
just love everything bright in neon so I
thought this would be really amazing for
photos and with a pan I think this is
going to look so good I really like how
it low back it is as well I feel like
this could also really nicely double up
as a body that you could actually just
wear on a daily basis this was so
affordable with only four pounds which
is insane the next to see that we got
from Primark is and this one here and
it's pretty much the same style and cut
and design but it's got a different
pattern so this one has like little cute
for men goes all over it and I literally
got this because I have this really cute
photo in mind like in my vision that I'm
going to wear this swimsuit on top of a
blow-up some ingo which I also got from
Primark and it's just going to be the
best thing ever
so yeah this liner fits really nicely
again it fits just as well as the pink
one that I just showed you it's again it
got the really low back at the back and
not much else to say it's not too
low-cut so for those of you who are like
worried about showing too much chest
this one is perfectly fine yeah I don't
really love this one I just think it's
so like fun to summer yeah I'm excited
to work I know I when literally swimsuit
crazy but I got another
and this one is Palm Springs Callie I so
wish I actually owned this before I went
to Coachella and to Palm Springs so I
could have worn it qicang promo if you
guys haven't seen the vlogs from
Coachella yet make sure you check them
out cuz they are like my favorite ever
but yeah this is such a nice color like
it's a royal blue but yeah this is a
really nice color for swimsuit I
actually didn't think that I would like
this but I think it works really well we
like my hair color and yeah I'm kind of
sad though because I've got this in a
size 14 thinking that it would fit me
but it really doesn't and the reason why
I got a size 14 was because this was
literally the only size left so yeah I'm
sad about that I'm probably gonna have
to return this but I just wanted to show
you guys that it was in Primark and it
probably still is but yeah I really like
it so the next thing he knew that I got
from Primark
is this one here and I absolutely fell
in love with this because of the colour
but when I honestly tried this on I was
actually quite disappointed because the
neck strap is actually perfectly fine it
fits really nicely and it sits exactly
where it's meant to be
however the butt isn't actually
adjustable and it's very loose like this
is a size 10 and I usually fit size 10
perfectly fine but this I just don't
know what it is but it just was so loose
at the back meaning that in that she
could just fall off any moment however
the bottoms are perfectly fine they look
like this so they just match the top and
these fit absolutely perfect and the
last prime of zucchini that I got is
this one here so this one is very
similar design it to the one that I just
showed you but this one is again like a
royal blue color and it's also a halter
neck which I absolutely love I think
it's so cute I also really love the fact
that this has pads inside so again you
don't see you niffle through it
so this is really nice I really like the
combination of the blue and the orange I
forgot the color then again it claps and
the back but this time it actually fits
perfect like it's as tight as it's meant
to be and the bottoms that it comes with
are these ones here which are exactly
the same as the ones I've just showed
you with the other swimsuit this bikini
is so pretty I would a hundred
recommend the cilantro at the bottom for
this one it was a 5-pound and the top
with 8 pounds so that is the end of my
Tryon bikini slash swimsuit haul I
absolutely love all the bikinis that I
purchased I'm going to find it really
difficult to choose which ones I'm going
to take on holiday let me know down
below which of these swimsuit socks
bikinis with your favor and if you are
going to buy any of them let me know
down below as well I have to help some
of you to kind of get inspiration for
the summer and just get pumped for
holidays and also I hope that helps you
guys see what it actually looks like on
a regular body rather than a model body
that you see on life or the website
where they model the actual swimsuit

bikinis actually look like on a real
body if you guys enjoyed this video make
