today I am coming at you guys with an
extra little upload because I don't
usually post on Friday but because today
is a Black Friday I thought I would come
at you guys with a little clothing haul
because why not and these are some of my
favorite like online clothing stores so
you guys are definitely going to love a
bunch of these things and the same way
that I do so I'll have all the links to
each of the items down below if you guys
want to pick them up yourself either
guys enjoy this video make sure you
click that Bell button down below to
stay notified every time I post new
videos and also subscribe if you haven't
already I would love to have you here
how enjoin their dinosaur family oh that
for ado let's get on into the holes okay
so the first store that we have a few
pieces from I think I picked up like
four things from here is boohoo I
absolutely love boo boo so the first
thing I have here is a pair of shoes and
oh my god these shoes you guys are gonna
die like what the heck
like can we just these shoes are
absolutely beautiful and so on trends
they have that like knitted kind of
effect I guess and the color is just so
pretty it's like a pasty kind of pink
color and then lace all the way up but
that's like a faux lace you do actually
have a zip on the side as well but yeah
these are absolutely beautiful I love
them I had no idea if I'll be able to
walk in though but I'm gonna try so it
makes item to kind of go with them shoes
is this little knit jumper it's cropped
and again it's the same kind of like
star as the shoe it's got like that
knitted effect and I just thought this
was so pretty it's high net which I love
high neck stuff so much so I just had to
get this and it's so like cozy and soft
and I've been loving these like nudie
kind of colors lately I think that's so
cool and you can definitely like dress
it up dress it down it's just like a
very casual simple piece to have in your
wardrobe now the festive season is here
I actually decided to kind of skip ahead
and maybe
we pick up a dress for like New Year's
Eve parties so I got this one here from
Buddha again and this is from like that
premium section and I just absolutely
love it like look at it it's so pretty
this reminds me very much of like
Belmond vibes
because of the like patterns and stuff I
just think it's such a cool dress I
don't know if you guys can see or how
well I'll be able to show you this but
it hasn't actually gotten back so it's
all cut out in the back so this is very
cool I really like this it's so
beautifully embellished and I just
couldn't resist this it was a little bit
pricey because it is the premium range
but I think it's still really worth it
for like a really really nice fancy
dress and then lastly from video I
picked up a pair of jeans so these are
just high-waisted jeans like this but
they're not your typical high-waisted
jeans they actually have this lace-up
effect on the side of each leg and I
thought this was so cool and so like
different you don't really see that many
pairs of jeans with this kind of thing
so I just had to get it and these I've
got in size 8 so they're gonna be really
nicely cinched in at the waist I don't
know if you guys struggle with that like
I do because I have quite wide hips but
then my waist is very tiny so I always
struggle with finding like jeans that
fit around my waist properly but I find
that these jeans really do so I really
love drew jeans for that so yeah these
are the jeans I can't wait to start them
they're gonna look so cool with like any
outfit you put together okay next up
we're gonna move on to pretty little
thing I love pretty little thing so much
like that one of my favorite stores as
well first up I have yet another pair of
shoes I'm so obsessed we're just getting
so many pairs of new shoes so this one
it's kind of in the
same with type of theme it's got like
that new color to it but look at them
they are absolutely gorgeous they're
like you're kind of all around nude
shoes I don't know I mean they kind of
like timberlands style I would say I
don't even know what this stylish shoe
is called but they remind me of
timberlands so yeah they're just uh uh
nude like pastor Lee kind of color they
have a zipper on the front and also shoe
laces I think these are going to be so
cozy for like autumn and winter and that
is perfect I love them so much
those thing they picked up from a pretty
little thing is this little top so this
is like what those iconic t-shirts that
everyone's been wearing recently because
I think it's meant to look like Gucci
and the Gucci shirt so this is just what
it looks like and I can't wait to like
style this maybe like tied up at the
front and maybe have like a nice little
pair of jeans were there and I think
it's really cool like it's a very nice
like casual t-shirt that you can
obviously dress up as well so yeah I
just picked up one of these in a size s
the next thing I got is a body and I've
seen people wear these kind of tops like
everyone on Instagram so I just thought
I'm gonna I'm gonna get one because I
really like them so basically it's like
one of these it's a Bardot kind of top
off the shoulders it's actually full
like body so it's that this is gonna be
perfect for like autumn if you still
want to like look a little bit more
dressed up because a lot of these tops
that I like this now usually it's like
cropped but this one goes all the way
down that you can tuck into your jeans
so you don't get cold and it's got long
sleeves so I think it's just gonna look
really cool you guys are definitely
gonna be seeing me or one of us in like
a future video and the last item I got
from a pretty little thing are a pair of
jeans so this is what they look like
they're kind of high-waisted again I
just love high waisted jeans I'll never
like you'll never see me wear jeans that
aren't high-waisted basically so I
really really like these they're kind of
like ripped in distress on the thigh and
also on the knee which is nice I don't
know if these are gonna be my size
actually I've got a size 10 maybe I
should have got a size 8 because they do
look a bit big but we shall see and
lastly the last job that I pick
type things from is misper unless you
can't even lift it so heavy it's a bust
up I have a huge box which obviously has
shoes inside
no surprise there guys no surprise so I
picked up oh I remember these now I
picked up these really long sigh hi nude
booties that's so nice I've always
wanted like sigh hi boots that are nude
because I have a black pair but I've
never had a nude pair so I'm very glad I
picked these up I've then got a really
big oversized jumper from Miss Pat which
is just a plain white like that but it's
got like a Gucci type stripe going all
through the jump and also the sleeves
it's very like casual and laid-back I
love these kind of jumpers because
they're so easy to throw on same as like
this one it's just so like chunky and
cozy and I just really like that kind of
thing the next thing I picked up is a
little knitted crossover jumper like
this it doesn't look that good when I'm
holding it up but it's gonna look
amazing on I can tell already it's just
kind of like a very slouchy type of deal
I really love these jumpers at the
moment they're so cute and like casual
but they make you look so like cozy and
comfy so I picked up one of these I
think this next thing is a two-piece so
this is like a track suit kind of
two-piece set so again a very slouchy
cozy jumper which I've been all about
lately in a gray color which is really
nice and like on trend and then the
bottoms are just these leggings which is
very simple they're ribbed as well which
is nice I hope they're going to be a
good fit because they seem quite snug
and like stretchy so that's really nice
the next item is another dress now this
one is like a body con type of dress
it's very simple and plain it's just
black oh it's got a bit thread on the
back there but it's just black and raped
with a long sleeve which is really nice
as well and it's got like a stripe kind
of pattern on the sleeve and also on the
high neck neckline which is really cool
I'm not really the type of person that
usually West dresses
so when I saw this I was like fool maybe
maybe not but I picked it up still looks
really nice on the model and I thought
hey maybe I can give it a go next thing
that I got is kind of more like the
fancy side I wouldn't usually wear this
um like everyday maybe for like going
out or whatever but it's kind of just
like this really nice it's getting
really washed out but it's like this
cream delays now I guess it's quite a
long one so yeah I mean I could really
pair this with like a really simple
t-shirt obviously I'd have it like
probably open and maybe just like a
really nice pair of jeans and a pair of
heels it's very plain and simple but I
just really liked it so I picked this up
as well I then just picked up another
one of these like Bardot crop tops
because I've been loving them lately
they're just so easy to wear and they
look really like nice and feminine I
just really like them so this one is
like a nudie beige kind of color but
it's got like this really nice silvery
thread going all through it so this is
another option I could possibly wear for
like New Year's Eve if I wanted to go
more down like the casual room next up
we have another one of those like Gucci
type of tops ah so this one actually
says guilty which is like Gucci thing
and it's got the like kind of Gucci Lego
I guess but yeah it's definitely meant
to look like a Gucci top so I really
liked it I thought was really cute it
was very affordable as well so I just
thought why not it would look really
cute with a pair of jeans guys I told
you I've been obsessed with like the
Bardot top trend recently so I actually
picked up a dress so this is just like a
very simple little black dress it's body
con but it's got that Bardot effect it
again and it's got a long sleeve too
which is really nice because obviously
if you want to wear a dress and it's
like really cold outside you don't want
to be like showing too much skin but
this is just like the perfect amount
because it still is gonna keep you like
warm but I could tell this dress is
gonna fit really nice because as you can
see it's so thin but it's very stretchy
material so it's gonna kind of like hug
you in the right places which is good
and then the last thing is basically yet
another one
those jumpers that like crosses over
it's very cute this is just in like a
baby pink color the other one was like a
nude no the other one was a great one
yeah I just got another one of those
because I really liked him so that is
the end of my Black Friday cool I hope
you guys enjoyed it it was actually kind
of big I didn't expect it to be that big
of a haul but it was actually quite big

interested in any of the pieces I've
gotta say I think the shoes in this haul
