little thank you I thought I would give
you guys three different giveaway prizes
um to basically thank you guys for all
the support you've been giving me over
the year of 2017 Before we jump straight
into it all the prizes I just want to
let you know there are two rules to this
giveaway I try to make them as easy and
quick as possible so you guys can really
easily enter so all you have to do is

and I will be checking if you followed
the rules so yeah as Lucia yeah I think
the rules are pretty easy to follow so I
hope they're okay with you guys then now
they went into the exciting part the
actual prizes so I have three different
prizes like I said I'm gonna jump into
the first prize which I call the NYX
prize I ordered the NYX prize because
this is literally just full of NYX
products and if you guys love NYX as
much as I do you'll totally appreciate
there's no package so the first thing we
have in the giveaway prize is this huge
Nick's foundation vault so basically let
me just quickly show you what's inside
because it is pretty pretty cool so here
we have some very familiar faces as you
guys can see there's some bloggers and
youtubers here and then at the bottom we
have all of the products and it's
literally
every foundation under the moon so this
is the total control drop foundation and
there's literally every shade you would
ever need so you guys are going to be
sorted for life with this and you can
totally give away different shades to
your friends if they don't match you so
yeah and it also comes with a little
brush and a Beauty Blender to the next
thing we have is another vault now this
is the liquid suede cream vault this is
every shade of the liquid suede lipstick
from NYX and I absolutely love the
formula of this there's literally so
many colors there's all the noobs all
the Browns there's some pretty cool and
wacky colors here as well but yeah you
have the choice of so many lipsticks and
these are like little mini ones as well
so you can like take them in your purse
and whatnot I have one of these myself
and it's the best thing ever we then
have it some little kits now these are
basically like a la Dublin and New York
kits so inside you get a lip cream and
then also like highlighter a bronzer and
then a few eyeshadows so this is like a
really cool start to here if you just
want to like do your makeup on the go
and every single one of these has
different like color schemes as you can
see the next thing we have is a little a
gift set now this is the match versus
glue gift set so here you have a bunch
of products for like your base you have
some finishing powder bronzer liquid
lipstick some pore filler also a liquid
highlight it's just a bunch of like the
staple and NYX products which I
absolutely love now for those of you
glow junkies out there which I totally
relate to you guys there is a born to
glow highlighting palette with six
different shades and I love this so much
it's so pigmented and you guys are gonna
love it we then also have three of the
holographic halo shimmer Stix these are
also little highlighters which are
popping and then lastly we have at three
of the cosmic metals lip creams from
Nick and these are so beautiful and
wearable colors so that was prize number
one now I'm gonna be hon to prize number
two which I like to call the maybelline
prize now in the Maybelline giveaway
prize we have that the first thing and
that is the Gigi Hadid color
this is the complete collection of
makeup from Gigi and there is literally
all of the shades of lipsticks all of
the little mini eyeshadow palettes the
highlighters the lip liners and even the
mascaras I literally love the packaging
and all the products and I'm so excited
for one of you who gets to win this next
we have a complete collection of all the
shades of the 24 hour foundation from
Maybelline and I absolutely love this
foundation it's so so easy to blend it's
very high in coverage and it's just one
of my favorites so you guys are
definitely gonna be sorted with this
then we have a little set of four of the
matte pink liquid lipsticks and these
are such pretty shades especially for
the holiday what I love about the
formula of this is that they literally
do not come off so you know how
lipsticks have that like weird line on
your lips sometimes after a few hours of
wearing it this does not have that so
it's perfect for like Christmas or
holidays when you're eating a lot and
drinking a lot so this will definitely
not be coming off and then lastly for
the main link prize I have some of these
city minis palates so these are actually
not out in the UK I don't think so these
are like an American thing we have some
really cool combinations of eyeshadows
in here and I love these so much that's
so easy to just like throw into your
purse so that was present number two we
now gonna move on to prize number three
this one doesn't really have like a
brand it's kind of like a mishmash of
all the different brands and there's no
one particular brand in this giveaway
but I really like all of the products in
it so the first thing I'm going to be
giving away is the iconic eyebrow
cushion it comes in like a little cute
gift box and inside is just three of the
cushions if I can get into it inside is
just a three of the eyebrow cushions
which come in such beautiful packaging
and I love them so much next up we have
a Charlotte Tilbury instant eye palette
this is such a beautiful eyeshadow
palette I literally kinda want to keep
it for myself but I love you guys very
much so this is totally gonna be in the
giveaway prize the next thing that in it
prize number three is a cow wand from
Mark Hill this is so exciting so
basically it comes with a five different
attached
so you can create like five different
looks of cars which is so cool because
it's so versatile and you can really
like just do whatever you want when
you're feeling like oh maybe one day I
want to come ahead like this but maybe
one day you want to curl your hair in a
different way so it's really good and
customizable and like I said there is
five different attachments so that's
really cool
we then have the revolutions soft as
nails at collaboration which I
absolutely love so I had to pick this up
for you guys from super drive so we have
the ultra eyeshadows which is 24
different eyeshadows and the packaging
is so beautiful and then we have the

highlighters from revolution to see you
