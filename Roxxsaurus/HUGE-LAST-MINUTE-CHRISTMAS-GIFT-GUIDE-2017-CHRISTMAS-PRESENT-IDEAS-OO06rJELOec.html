today I am so excited for this video I
am pimped out for Christmas and I'm not
even mad about it Christmas is this she
in like a week so I thought I would do a
kind of like a last-minute Christmas
gift guide for you guys and obviously
this video can also be treated as a
wishlist type of video because if you
guys still don't know what you want for
Christmas I mean it's a week away but
you might find some inspiration from
this video and you might just ask Santa
for one of these things I'm about to
show you and who knows if you've been
good you might just get it also I'm
wearing these antler is from Primark and
they're very like jeans Elise so if you
hear a lot of jingling I'm really sorry
but they're just waiting huge not to
work if you guys haven't seen my
Christmas makeup giveaway you guys
totally should go enter there's still
like a few days left that you can enter
and as a Christmas gift for me I would
honestly love for you guys to just click
the bail-bond down below to stay
notified of every time I post a new
video that would be the best Christmas
gift for me like ever because that means
you guys actually get to watch my videos
when I post them okay but that's enough
rambling without further ado let's get
on into the video so like I said in this
video there's gonna be different price
points and I'm not gonna really put them
in categories or anything I'll just kind
of go through everything I've got and
also mention the prices either on-screen
or I'll say them out loud so the first
thing I got which is like one of the
cutest things I have ever seen and that
is this hot water bottle from Primark
this was only eight pounds but I think
that this is such a cute gift idea
especially like for wintertime because
everyone is always cold so this would
just be like perfect such a caring kind
of gift and obviously it doesn't break
the bank so that's good and plus it's
Disney so for any Disney lovers in your
family this would be the perfect gift
the next gift I have is literally the
most adorable thing ever it's basically
a panda mug with a biscuit pocket this
is from Urban Outfitters and I just love
this so much look how cute that is
this was actually only 12 pounds which
is not even that pricey for a mug like
and especially cuz it's so cute it's got
like this kind of a novelty aspect of it
I think it's just so worth the money
it's just the cutest and it's got a pock
here like come on and can it get any
better the next give options
urban outfitters is a little skincare
set this is going to be perfect for
those family members or friends that
just are so into skincare and looking
after their skin so this is one my
favorite skin care brands and it's
called Mario Badescu I honestly swear by
this little product here it's literally
the best at like drying out spots
overnight and this is basically just
like a trio with three different
products inside and absolutely love it
it is a little bit on the pricey side
it's 34 pounds but I think it's so well
worth the money because all of these
products by themselves are quite
expensive as it is I think that drying
lotion is like 20 pounds by itself but
it's honestly the best thing ever
so it's got a drying cream for like
drying out spots it's got a drawing a
lotion for drying out spots and also a
special healing powder for after you've
tackled the spa
honestly this skincare brand is like a
lifesaver
Holy Grail skincare brand for me so I
definitely recommend this now the next
present is slightly more on the high-end
side and is a lot more pricey than the
other ones I've just showed you but this
present would be so perfect for any
music lover and obviously you have to
really love that person if you're going
to spend this amount of money on them so
basically it's the Harper Crosley Urban
Outfitters speaker this is such a
gorgeous speaker right look at this it's
just so aesthetically pleasing now this
was 80 pounds which I do realize that
it's quite an expensive item to like buy
any one for Christmas but it's just so
worth the money like it looks amazing
your room if there's literally any of
your family members who love music this
would be perfect for them and on that
same spectrum of things I also have the
Crosley turntable this is honestly the
best thing ever if I bought this for
Christmas I would be like crying because
this is just so aesthetically pleasing I
love like old vintage kind of stuff like
this obviously this is brand new it's
not vintage but like the kind of style
is so like vintage and ahh I just love
it and this was again it's gonna be
quite expensive actually it's not that
bad it's 89 pounds which is not that
much more than at the speaker it's only
9 pounds more than the speaker which is
crazy but obviously for this you have to
get vinyls as well but there's like so
vinyl CDs out there like ariana grande
like Beyonce all those like famous
people who are so current at the moment
are releasing vinyls as well as normal
CDs and stuff so again this would just
be perfect for any music lover and it
would look amazing if anyone's house and
the last item from Urban Outfitters is
this this is a set of marble bed sheet
I honestly fell in love with this when I
saw it on the website so I had to get it
kind of for myself I'm not gonna lie I
just get the king-sized set because I've
got a king-size bed but basically this
would just be perfect about anyone's
room it's a unisex present as well so
you could get it for a guy or a girl and
I just really like the pattern it's so
like Instagram wall and aesthetically
pleasing I'm just like this whole gift
guide is about like aesthetically
pleasing items which is so right up my
street so yeah this is definitely a
really thoughtful gift that anyone would
love and this was at 50 pounds by the
way guys if you guys aren't following me
on my second channel rocks or as vlogs
you totally should because I've been
like I've been doing vlogmas this whole
like month if you guys didn't know like
I'll link it in the corner there so make
sure you guys catch up on all the vlogs
and I'm gonna be blogging Christmas as
well so I'm so pumped for that but now
I'm moving on to the next gifts I'm
gonna show you guys a few items that
I've been really really eyeing up on
coal beauty and I think these would make
amazing gift so the first item is this
this is a little pixie skin gift set and
it's got three different items it's got
the globe mud cleanser glow tonic and
Glo mud mask so again this would be
perfect for anyone who loves skincare
and likes to really look after their
skin and it's just such cute packaging I
mean look at that
now for any makeup lovers out there this
would be like a dream come true to get
this I've mean personally for me I would
love to receive these items so the first
thing is a little stocking filler of the
harder' Beauty mini like warm brown
obsessions palette it's got nice shadows
and it's just like the cutest little
palette like this would be such a nice
stocking filler I have the prices on
screen because I can't actually remember
how much these things were for me this
would be like the perfect
to receive because I love makeup and you
guys know how the beauty is where it's
at and because I love how to beat you so
much I also got the other palette which
is the desert dust palette this is such
a beautiful palette as well it's so
worth the money and this will just make
such an amazing gift for like any person
that wants to start out doing makeup or
just loves playing with makeup that kind
of thing the next item from Cote beauty
is this is the Weaver a vegan prime set
of 10 brushes and a clutch this is
perfect because obviously it's got 10
brushes again for any makeup lover that
will be like amazing so here are all the
different brushes they're just so useful
and so soft I love zoeva brushes so much
and the fact that it's vegan makes it
even better you also get a little clutch
with it which is just perfect so yeah I
think this would be a very thoughtful
gift to any makeup lover out there
because brushes are like always so
important now this last gift is my
personal favorite because I would
actually scream if I receive this and
that is the Beca box set of highlighters
right let me just open this up for you
guys I can't get in I can't get any guys
are you guys ready for this ahh so in
here we have one two three four five six
highlighters oh my god I just love all
the back of highlighters I pretty much
use this becca highlighter everyday i
think this is a moonstone so if i
received like all of them i would
literally cry my eyes out hole in
happiness
now the next gifts are actually from jo
malone i have two hair and obviously
drove alone is such like a high-end kind
of expensive candle brand but it's so
worth it because it smells absolutely
amazing so the first thing i have is
this little box set from jeremy loan and
this is the cologne collection so inside
it's got five of the different colors
and these smell oh my god it smells so
good that's so like the long-lasting and
like very very strong in sin so these
are definitely worth a try i think this
would be such a perfect gift for like
your mom your girlfriend your grandma

in item which is package so beautiful
it's just such luxury packaging I just
love it so much I'm so inside here you

nectarine blossom and honey you can
choose whatever candy you have obviously
and this is just how it comes in the box
again this is such a nice present you
get like as a main kind of present cause
it's quite expensive but it's just
packaged so beautifully that I know
anyone would love to receive theirs next
up for any lippy lovers out there I have
the lips of leash buxom lips at so in
here you get 15 different mini lipsticks
mini plunking like lip glosses and
things like that they're all have
different finishings so some of them are
like glittery some of them are match I
would totally love this if I got it for
Christmas so I think you would make such
a good gift then I have another gift for
people who just are obsessed with like
lipsticks or any lip products it's the
bare minerals go nude or make a
statement lips at this is an eight-piece
collection of mini Jen nude Radian and
mini statement like shine lipsticks so
in here you get obviously eight
lipsticks perfect for any lip lover
totally a great gift and if you guys did
want to get someone brushes but you can
really afford the zoeva ones you could
totally opt out for a slightly more
affordable option this only has three
brushes but it's from a bad minerals
this is the 3-piece deluxe brush
collection it's got a like a face brush
I guess a highlighter brush and then
like a blending brush so that's just
perfect for like anyone who just loves
makeup and needs some brushes
now the next gifts are gonna all come
from the body shop which I absolutely
love the first thing is actually quite
an interesting thing so basically it's a
countdown to new year so a lot of people
are so upset once Christmas like
finishes I know I am because it just
goes so quick but this just kind of lets
you be a little bit more festive for a
little bit longer and so inside you have
a countdown kind of like a Beauty
calendar sort of thing from a Christmas
day all the way up to New Year's so it
just lets you be a bit more festive for
a little bit longer like I said
and it's perfect for anyone who loves
like beauty advent calendars now I have
a few gift ideas for men but obviously
you could get this for anyone you could
get this for a woman as well so the
first thing I have is a shave away kit
so it looks like this this is also from
the body shop

believe this is quite inexpensive as
well so I think this would make a really
good like stocking for the present I
then also have the tea tree a gift set

a oh this is a wash scrub mass and also
the anti imperfection daily solution

corresponding lip balm so you get the
strawberry lip balm man your lip balm
and also the coconut lip balm which is
just such a perfect little gift and last
but not least the gifts I'm about to
show you are from a brand called London
Tyler now I found out about this brand
because they sent me one of these
diffusers and a candle to my P o box and
I opened it and I was like this smells
divine it's made my whole bathroom smell
absolutely amazing and I always struggle
finding diffusers that actually produce
lots and lots of scents in the house you
can usually smell it really up-close but
when you like go further away you can't
smell as much whereas with these oh my
god this smells so strong actually also
saw a Landon tireless stand in Milton
Keynes Shopping Center so yeah you can
just pick them up online or from those
kings if you live anywhere nearby yeah
this is just basically some diffuse
and I have the wild berries and dark
Kashmir which both of these smell
amazing then I also have a two little
