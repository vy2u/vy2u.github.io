video I am going to be doing a yet
another Primark haul but this time it's
gonna be autumn addition because autumn
is finally here and I'm sorry bloom and
excited for autumn fashion like there's
way too many nice things in Primark at
the moment so I let you just went in and
I spend way too much money so in today's
video I'm just gonna show you guys what
I picked up from Primark for Alterman
but before I do I actually want to let
you guys know that this video is in
collaboration with happy cafe which is a
really addicting game I'm not gonna lie
I get so addicted to like app game so
the game happy cafe is basically like a
chef kind of style game so you get to
run your own little cafe on like a
really cute farm and basically the aim
of this game is to just expand your
business gain coins that builds like
your cafe expand it and all that kind of
good stuff with the little diamonds you
can buy kitchen things and like little
tables we're just so adorable it's
honestly so much fun because I love
anything like to do with cooking like
any cooking related game pretty much you
make your own like food and then serve
it to customers and try and get them to
be like happy to you know gain your like
status and then you get to learn new
recipes when you're like level up in the
game now I'm currently on level seven of
this game and I am so addicted if you
guys download this game let me know down
below what level you are on and whether
you beat me and we can like try and beat
each other down below honestly so
addicted to this game already and I love
playing it if I'm on the train to
somewhere and if I ever have like a few
minutes to spare then this game is
definitely my go-to but yeah I'll have
the game down below so you guys can
check it out yourself and see how
addicting it is because I'm telling you
it is so addictive okay but now without
further ado let's get on into the hall
the first thing I'm actually gonna get
out of the way straight away because I
know you guys are gonna ask me where is
this jumper from it's actually from boo
boo I'll link it down below see you guys
it can buy it if you like but anyways
the first thing I purchased from a
Primark is
this is a little cardigan it's so cozy
and so like fleecy and warm it actually
has two sides so it has like this nude
kind of brown color on the like inside
and then on the outside it's just black
and I absolutely love this it's quite a
long one so it's gonna really keep you
warm in the winter and all term it's
actually gonna be quite nice to wear
instead of like a jacket just because
it's so warm and so long it's actually
only cost 15 pounds which is actually
really good for this type of thing it's
also got a little pockets on the sides
which is so nice that you can like pop
some change in whatever your phone in
the same it check your theme I also
picked up this scarf which is just like
I really love the scarf I also got a red
one of these like in my previous holder
you know I thought I had to get a white
one too just because it's so cute and
it's gonna look so nice with like a
brown or a black coat just like add a
little bit of light to it the only thing
I have to say about this is that the
fluff like really comes off so maybe
don't wear black with this scarf because
it will be like white it will turn white
pretty much but I really like it anyways
it's really warm and this was only four
pounds the next thing I got is actually
one of my favorite things in this haul
and it's actually this coat so it's like
I can't even see on camera but it's like
a black denim coat with a faux fur
lining and I saw this I think on I don't
know I saw it somewhere online and I was
like I have to get this I was so scared
that this wouldn't be in my local like
pry marks but it actually was so I was
like yes and also this sold out so quick
like I'm barely found at my size now
this cost me 25 pounds which I feel like
for a coat of this quality is actually
really really good and it feels like
really heavy and actually well-made
which is definitely gonna keep you warm
in the autumn / winter periods because I
love that black host so much I also had
to get a denim version of it basically
the black coat is basically this but in
black so it's just like a really nice
denim jacket it's quite a long one too
so it's more like a pie I guess and then
it has like
the fur lining faux fur of course on the
inside but this one is white so I feel
like this is like a really nice
alternative but if I don't want to dress
all black and this was also at 25 pounds
now next up we actually have a pair of
shoes these shoes are so nice
I love these so much when I saw them I
was like I have to get them they're
basically like a silky material but what
I loved about them is the fact that they
have like this really chunky heel
they look so comfy they're basically an
alternate stitch with my pretty little
thing boots which is so tall and they're
so uncomfortable so I thought I'd have
to get like a little bit more of a
wearable heel for like everyday if I'm
just running around town or whatever
it's not only sixteen pounds as well
which I feel like for shoes of this kind
of look is quite good cuz she's like
this are usually quite expensive I'm
just gonna say right off the bat I
bought way too many jumpers but that's
like a thing that you wear the most
throughout autumn so I'm not even sorry
so the first one I got is this one and
it's like a really nice tan camel kind
of Brown it actually has really
interesting sleeves the bell shaped I
guess so they kind of like cinch in and
then they kind of like droop over like
this which is so nice and also it has my
curved high neck sort of thing which is
gonna keep my neck warm so I totally
love that
now this jump-up was at ten pounds which
for a jumper can't go wrong the next
thing I got is another Brown like camel
kind of color item and this is like a
niche dress this was only 13 pounds and
it's quite like a long knit dress it's
kind of cinched in at the waist I don't
know if you can see that but yeah it's a
really really nice fit I tried it on and
straw and I was like this is the one I
love it I love the fact that it's got
long sleeves because it's really going
to keep me warm it's actually just above
the knee so that's like the perfect kind
of length it's not too long and yeah
it's really really soft and cozy so if
you guys can pick this up definitely do
so this next one is kind of like a shirt
slash jumper all in one so this is
something I don't usually go for but I
saw it and it looked really nice on the
hanger
I get it anyways just a try on see if I
suit it it's basically like a
jumper is very like see-through actually
now that I'm looking at it and you can
visually see my favorite lights behind
it it has like this really nice like
stripy color and then it's got the
bottom of like the shirts obviously it's
just like attached it's not shut all the
way underneath sort of like this kind of
business so this was a 13 pounds which
again very affordable when I went into
the hat section I thought I'd get a
little bit carried away because there
was just so many hands that I absolutely
loved by ended up actually just getting
one this is something I've always wanted
to try to see if I suit it so this is
the moment I'm gonna put my hair in a
middle parting can you guys guess what's
coming if this doesn't suit me I will be
very very sad I don't know you eyes
through it this hat makes my head look
like a really weird shape is that just
me I don't know if I'm feeling it let me
know down below what you guys think so
uh I told you guys I got a bit carried
away in the jumper section so I picked
up a yet another jumper and this one it
was actually in the sales section this
was only five pounds which when I looked
at it I was like five pounds I'll take
it so this is really nice it's got like
a grey slash baby pink pastel kind of
stripe to it it's ripped all over which
I think it's so nice so these holes
might not keep me the warmest in autumn
but gotta do it for the fashion steamer
right I picked up yet another coat cos
coats autumn it makes sense so this one
is actually really cute it's like a faux
shearling Schilling Schilling Schilling
Foshee p-- kind of material it's a
really nice collects like a gray kind of
cream color gray that's one's in a word
Rae cream kind of color it's cropped as
well which I absolutely love I'm
actually gonna put it on for you guys
cuz I feel like I'm not doing it justice
so this is what it looks like I think
it's so cute and I'm definitely you're
gonna get a lot of use out of this oh
and this was only 25 pounds again
which I feel like is a really good price
but it's kind of code so we have yet
another jumper this is very like
Halloween themed I just had to I just
couldn't I couldn't leave this bar this
is actually a really good material this
is the type of thing that you'd probably
find on a sauce or like boohoo there
kind of thing I absolutely love the
color it just feels so soft and I know
I'm gonna love this and this was only 13
pounds the next thing I picked up is
this little shirt which again isn't
really my kind of style usually but
because autumn is coming I thought you
know might as well switch it up a bit
and I picked up this I really like the
fact that it's quite distressed at the
bottom and also on the collar which just
gives it like a little bit something you
know and this was at ten pounds and the
last thing that I picked up is at this
little cardigan which is so adorable
this was like right by the door as I
walked in and everyone was like jumping
out it everyone was so crazy for this
jumper so this is what it looks like
it's just like a pinky nude color but at
the bottom it has this really cool
striped pattern at the back well all the
way around really and then it's also
cuffed which is so nice and yeah I just
really liked it it's really super soft
and Mike quit stretchy as well so this
is definitely gonna keep me warm in the
autumn and this was a 13 pounds so that
is all for my thoughts in Primark haul I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video

these items was your favorite I
absolutely loved everything I bought as
well maybe apart from the tab and hat

thought it would but overall I just love
