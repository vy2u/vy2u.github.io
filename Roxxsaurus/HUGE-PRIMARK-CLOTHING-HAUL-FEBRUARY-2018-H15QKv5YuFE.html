today I am so excited because I am
coming back at you guys with another
Primark haul I actually haven't done a
program called in a hot minute so I went
into prime up today and I picked up a
little bit too much stuff like I
literally have one two full bags of
Primark stuff and I'm so excited because
I picked up some clothes but also some
home wire in there as well it's a little
bit of a mixture of everything but I'm
really excited to show you guys what I
got if you guys are brand-new and have
never seen my face before make sure you
guys to come and join the dinosaur
family by subscribing down below and
also don't forget to click the Bell
button to stay notified do it every time
I post a new video but without further
ado let's get on into the video oh my
goodness when I saw this I was like I
need this because I already have the
black version and then I saw the white
version so basically this is like the
Mickey Mouse backpack but this is like
the Minnie Mouse I guess because it's
got the bow oh my goodness I'm in love
with this you guys can't even see it
because it's so washed out but it's just
a white backpack it's basically the same
one as the black except it's got the bow
I don't even care that I already have
one of these but this one is just so
special because it's white and it's like
so aesthetically pleasing this was only
12 pounds which is such a good bargain
because things like this from like
Disney like the original Disney Store
would be so expensive so I'm really
really happy that I picked this up and
you guys know I'm a Disney lover as you
can talk with my jumper so this is just
perfect the next thing I got is a denim
jacket you guys know I love my denim and
it kind of feels like spring today like
although it's still winter it just feels
like spring so when I saw this I was
like okay spring and summer is on the
way so I can kind of justify getting it
because it just feels like spring so
this is what it looks like it's just
like a cropped denim jacket and I
absolutely loved the color of it I feel
like it's the perfect sort of denim
color and it's also got all these little
rips on it as well which makes it look
really like Topshop or new look that
kind of thing and this was only 20
pounds which is actually a really good
price for a denim jacket like this
because the material feels really thick
like the denims not too thin or anything
so you can definitely tell that it's a
really good quality kind of denim jacket
now this next thing I absolutely love
when I saw this I was kind of like do I
pick this up or not though because it's
not something that I usually wear but I
really want to get into wearing trousers
more so when I saw this pair I was just
like oh what my goodness so this is what
they look like they're kind of like a
drop trouser thing but it's such a nice
nude color and I loved the waistband
it's like really cinched in at the back
and then it's got a bow at the front and
I just have to have this like honestly I
have no idea how I'm gonna sell this
because it's something that I don't
usually go for but I just I had to get
it and this I got actually in a size 6
because I really wanted the waist to be
like super cinched in and super high
waisted and I felt like would these I
can kind of get away with wearing a size
6 or the arm a size 10 on my bottoms and
these were only 10 pounds honestly that
is such a bargain because you could get
things like this from like pretty little
thing or boohoo or misguided for like a
whole lot more then going with the whole
spring summer theme I just can't wait
for summer that's why I'm getting all
this like summery cloves I got this and
this is just like a really nice chiffon
II sort of material top the reason why I
picked it up cuz I really liked the
sleeves and they're so like flowy and I
just I don't know I really love the
color yellow makes me happy
I just really love wearing yellow so
this was only 10 pounds and I can just
imagine how amazing this is gonna look
when I tuck it into some like denim
shorts in the summer it's gonna be so
cute the next thing I got is a hoodie
now I saw this and I was a little bit
confused at first what this was I kind
of I first thought that they had a hood
at the front but it doesn't it's kind of
just like I don't know like a neckline
it's like really weird it's kind of like
a turtleneck but it's a it's not really
a hoodie it's more of a jumper really
yeah it has like the cinched in thing I
just thought was really cool and I got
this in my cast size 16 I think yeah I
got it in a size 16 just because I
wanted it to be a little bit more
oversized I'm really not doing it
justice by showing it up this is what it
looks like and I just felt like this
would be a really cool jumper to just
throw on when I'm having a lazy day and
I don't
wanna like dress to fancy and this was
only 7 pounds would you believe that
like that is that's a really good price
for hoody and it's really soft to men to
kind of match the jumper I went for
these shoes which are just absolutely
gorgeous I love the color again they're
nude and they kind of remind me of like
Timberland star boots and I just felt
like these were perfect for this sort of
like weather that we're in Alamo mugs
it's still cold but sometimes it's sunny
I don't know obviously it's still winter
so I guess these I can still get a lot
of use out of before it starts becoming
too warm to wear shoes like this these
are only 14 pounds too so I feel like
that's a pretty good price for shoes the
next thing I got is just a pack of
underwear very boring vans got three
pairs of underwear I just really needed
some new underwear the next item I got
is another accessory now this one I saw
it I was like getting such Chanel vibes
look at this handbag oh my goodness it
is so pretty and it looks very similar
to like the style of like Chanel handbag
because they have that whole chain going
around the front and obviously the
pattern as well I guess it just looks
really really cool and it looks way more
expensive than it was it was only 12
pounds of this bag and I really love the
fact that it's got like a real chain
detailing for the actual strap I feel
like that just gives it a lot more of a
luxurious look and this bag is actually
quite spacious too so you'll definitely
be able to fit a lot in there I picked
this up because it gives me such you
know vibes and this was only 12 pounds
so like can't go wrong I then picked up
another pair of shoes and this is what
they look like they're kind of just like
a wedge not really like a platform a
shoe in like a really nice nude Sawadee
sort of color these were only 12 pounds
oh my god I swear everything I got today
we're like 12 pounds yeah these are just
gonna be perfect for like a summer
spring I love them and like for holidays
like going away and they're gonna be so
nice I then got a jumper that I've been
eyeing up for quite a few visits since
I've been to Primark and I never really
got around to getting it I'm not too
sure why but today I picked it up this
is what it looks like it's just like a
very plain white jumper
it's got like
slight texture to it but not too much
but I really liked it because the
sleeves are like I don't even know
they're like ripped I guess so that's
kind of different I haven't really seen
a jump like this before which is why I
was kind of drawn to it I got this in
the size s and this was only thirteen
pounds so again really nice jumper to
just like throw on when you're having
like a lazy day and you don't really
want to plan out like an amazing outfit
now the last three things that I got
from Primark are actually home wear bibs
and I'm so excited about this one
because this is such a gorgeous pillow
oh my goodness so I got this for my
office space for like this sofa and I
just love it it's just like pink like
pasady sort of pink / nude and then it's
got like a gold thread going through to
like create the pattern and this was
only 7 pounds which is like such a big
bargain for a pillow like this nice and
it's so soft the next thing I got is a
little fake plant now this is another
thing that I've always wanted to pick up
from a Primark but I never really got
around to it this was six pounds at
which I like I've really decent price
for a fake plant like this if you watch
my vlogs I have fake plants all around
my house because I cannot keep real ones
alive so this is perfect because it's
just never gonna die I picked this up
because I really like the actual pattern
on the plant pot itself I think it's
really cool and the last thing that I
picked up from the home where section
from Primark is this it's just like a
really pretty dainty marble tea light
holder I was kind of like do I really
need this where where I actually put
this but I love anything marble and it
was only three pounds so I just had to
get it so and that is everything that I
picked up from Primark these bags in our
empty I really really love everything
that I picked up let me know down below
what your favorite thing from this haul
was I honestly can't even choose I think
