today I have another Primark haul for
you guys
I love Primark hauls so much so I really
hope you guys don't mind me doing
another one I'm actually going to
Disneyland like tomorrow with Primark
and I'm so excited because I've actually
never been to Disneyland before so I
actually received a bunch of products at
from Primark to kind of get me ready for
the trip this video is not sponsored
they just sent it to me so I can wear it
throughout the trip but I'd like to show
you guys because it's some things that I
absolutely love it's like mostly Disney
as well so I'm all-in
I just want to show you guys the clothes
they sent me for the trip because I
would actually buy all this myself
anyway so I thought hey might as well
film a Primark haul
if you guys enjoyed this video and make
sure you subscribe I'm enjoying the
dinosaur family and also hit that Bell
button just down below so you guys can
get notified every time I post a new
video but without further ado let's get
on into the video ok so I literally have
a whole pile of stuff on the floor I
think I'm going to begin with the non
Disney stuff first because there's not
that much of it and I really just love
how all tumble everything is so I feel
like it's very appropriate for this
month so the first thing I have here is
this really cute &amp;amp; bobble hat and also a
scarf that literally is like from the
same set so this hat was only 2 pounds
can you guys believe that like it's such
a cute little hat let me put it on real
quick how cute is that
it's actually adorable I love it I'm
definitely gonna be taking this on the
trip with me look at my hair looks like
a bird's nest now and then the scarf is
basically the same color looks so cozy
and warm and it's just like the perfect
color for autumn it's like that pumpkin
spice kind of color and the scarf was
only as six pounds so that's a bargain
and the next thing I have here is this
gorgeous little skirt it's like a faux
suede kind of material this was 11 euros
I'm not sure how much it was in pounds
probably around 10 or 8 pounds and this
is such a nice like fabric and color
I've been loving this kind of tan color
for autumn recently it's just such a
good color it also sent me the Saif's
Cup in like the wine kind of burgundy
color which is also a really good for
autumn and winter it's just like a very
wintry kind of color which I love and
yeah it's basically the same skirt just
in different color they also sent me
this
here which is very similar it's a little
bit different in design it haven't got a
zipper on the front but it's like this
nice kind of like leathery faux leather
obviously material and it's just a gray
color and how much was this this was
eight pounds
next thing I have here is this jumper
right here which is so cozy and snuggly
I actually love it it's also soft and
this was 13 pounds I don't really know
what this fabric is called I think it's
like chenille something like that I've
been seeing this kind of fabric like
everywhere recently like on ASOS and
staff and jumpers like this are quite
expensive but this is quite affordable
which is good I think I sent some
trousers which I love trousers from
Primark the skinny jeans are like
literally fit like a glove every time
for me so I'm very excited that I got a
pair of the skinny mid-rise jeans and
what I really love about them is that
they have a really frayed like leg so
it's just very like I don't know just
add something rather than being so plain
so that's really cool and these were
only a 15 pounds I then got another
bubble hat which I'm gonna be sorted for
Disneyland because I can tell it's
already gonna be really cold I'm gonna
be freezing so it's a good thing I've
got some bubble hats and this was 2
pounds which is really good and my hat
please ignore that whew this is really
cool this is like a really cozy black
coat you guys can't even tell on camera
but it's like a long coat kind of goes
past the hip a little bit and I already
have one of these from Primark from like
last year or two years ago and it's
literally still my favorite coat to this
day so I absolutely love coats like this
so like warm and cozy and you kind of
feel like you're wearing a robe or
something and then got another jacket
for autumn I don't think this would be
very appropriate for winter but for
autumn it's perfect because it's that
kind of like faux suede biker kind of
style jacket and it's like a really nice
yellow color this was at 25 pounds which
I feel like is actually a reasonable
price for a coat like this so I'm
excited to incorporate this into some
outfit by the way guys that when I go
away at 2 it just
I'm gonna be vlogging every single day
I'm going for like the whole weekend so
make sure you guys check out my vlogging
channel if you haven't already I feel
like a lot of people don't know I have a
vlog channel but I do it could rocks or
a slug so I'll link it down below and
also they sent me these shoes right here
which I think are really cool they're
kind of like a Doc Martin kind of style
feel to it which I really like and they
have like these really nice pearls which
adds like a lot of detail to it and
they're not actually tie up their zip up
which is really cool okay but now for my
favorite part we're gonna move on to you
at the Disney X Primark stuff oh my god
I love all of this stuff so much so the
first thing that I got sent from the
Disney range is a throw oh my god I love
the simmers is basically like her Minnie
Mouse or Mickey Mouse all over it let me
just open it up I think it's actually
Mickey and Minnie correct me if I'm
wrong and how much was this this was six
pounds so oh my god it feels so soft
let's have a look look I love it oh
that's so cute oh my god I'm actually
moving house literally next week so this
is gonna be perfect for my new house if
you guys would like to see like an empty
house tour let me know in the comments
below because this is a pretty big deal
to me like I've been living in this
house for like a year but I'm so excited
like the house I'm moving into is so
much better so I'm very excited I'll
definitely be doing like a house tour
once it's finished but if you would like
to see an empty one let me know as well
this next thing is probably my most
favorite thing I've ever received in my
whole life it's a Mickey Mouse sorry
Minnie Mouse hoodie and it's got a like
Minnie Mouse
is on the hood so this is Sookie way I'm
gonna actually try this on because I can
tell I'm gonna be wearing this like
strutting around Disneyland just wearing
my Minnie Mouse hoodie oh my god this is
so cute I love it
so how much was this I wonder what does
it say
ah doesn't say it dammit so this doesn't
actually have a price but I'm sure it
would have been probably around fourteen
pounds or something maybe a little bit
more because of the ears but I loved it
you guys should totally pick this up and
we can be matching I got quite a few
videos from Primark which I'm very
excited for because the hoodies are
literally like so comfy so I got this
one and I love how like fashionable it
is I really like the fact that it says
like mini all over the drawstrings and
it's just got mini like three Minnie
Mouse's on the actual chest and it's red
so it's gonna be perfect for like
Christmas this was ten pounds I then got
the Mickey Mouse equivalent so it's just
a black hoodie and it just says Mickey
Mouse all over it and I love it so much
a black hoodie actually comes with a set
so this is like um leggings I guess so
they're just black plain black leggings
but on the leg
it says Mickey Mouse and it's like the
sketched kind of Mickey Mouse and if you
guys can see that that's so cute
so christmas is coming up and we all
know that I'm obsessed with Christmas
I've literally like already been buying
Christmas presents for everyone so this
jumper excites me a lot because it's a a
Christmas Mickey Mouse jumper it's so
cute so this is what it looks like it's
just so cozy it's got a little like
pom-pom on it as well which is adorable
I'm definitely gonna be wearing this in
November even though it's no windy
Christmas yet but I'm totally taking
this to design um with me this next
thing is another adorable item that I
know I'm just gonna get so much wear out
of its a denim jacket with like a Mickey
Mouse patches all over it it's got a
Mickey Mouse on the back and I just
think it's adorable like I love this
like fuzzy faux fur kind of trim and
yeah it's just so cute and it says hello
folks down there and then up here it
says oh boy and this was at 25 pounds
and the next thing that I see is
oh my god it's so cute it's a Mickey
Mouse backpack with little Mickey Mouse
is at the top and it also comes with
this little like coin purse I guess and
it's also got the same Mickey Mouse ears
on it which is adorable
so the backpack was a 9 pounds which is
so affordable I thought this would have
been like 15 but it's only 9 and this
person was only 4 pounds I was actually
looking at to buy a new backpack so this
is great the next thing I have here is a
Mickey Mouse shirt which is just like a
white button-up shirt with Mickey Mouse
all over it this is so me
I would totally wear this and this was
10 pounds so cute oh my god how cute is
this though this is adorable it's got a
little Bambi on it but it's like her
what is this actually called a hot water
bowl why did I forget well that's good
so this was how much were you this was 8
pounds and I actually needed one of
these like I've always wanted a hot
water bottle I don't know why but I've
never had one so I'm very excited for
this the next thing I've got is a pair
of Mickey Mouse slippers and oh my god
these are so soft
I've actually needed a new pair of
slippers so I'm very excited to put
these on and they've got like little
things at the bottom like slip proof I
don't know what they're called basically
so you don't slip on the floor and crack
your head open so these are worth 4
pounds the next thing I have is a
ceramic mug which is just like Mickey
Mouse's bottom I guess I don't really
know this is what it looks like I'm not
gonna get it out but this is what it is
and it's just basically like Mickey
Mouse's trousers and shoes and his hand
going like this so you can like hold
onto his hand as you drink so that's
very cute and this was at 5 pounds the
next thing I see is this little chip bag
from of you in the Beast it comes with
like a really long strap and this was
only 5 pounds it's such a cool little
like bad just to like pop your phone in
or pop some money in it's like the
perfect kind of size so I love that I
told you guys this haul was gonna be
really long I'm almost there okay so the
next thing is there's a big jumper we've
lied to the whole Disney crew so it's
got like Donald the dog it's got Mickey
Mouse
Minnie Mouse and Goofy and Pluto and
it's so cute it doesn't actually say how
much this was the tag has been pulled
off but I really like this then we have
another jumper which it's so cute it's
got like a little embroidered like the
whole Mickey gang so it's got Mickey
Mouse again Donald Duck Minnie Mouse
Pluto and goofy and so cute they're all
wearing like little Christmas hats and
this jumper was 14 pounds I've then got
another sweatshirt with the whole Mickey
gang on it which is just gray and the
fabric is so nice and soft and then I
got a hoodie with Murray from the
aristocrats and it's so cute
again just got three of the Murray cats
on it just like the Mickey one and I
love this this next shot is so cute so
it's got Mickey and Minnie and Minnie is
holding Mickey's is and then on the back
you can see the back of them was just so
clear I thought that idea for a shirt
was really really cute and adorable I
don't know about the UK price for this
but this says it was 8 euros I then have
another t-shirt with just Mickey all
over it so it's just the plain black tee
with a Mickey like embroidered patches
on it which is so cute and this was 8
pounds and lastly for climbing I have
some Christmasy leggings which have like
Mickey Mouse all over it I don't know if
you guys can see but that's adorable at
first I thought this was like pajama
bottoms or something which I guess you
could use it as that but I think that
actually meant to be leggings that you
can wear on like Christmas Day with like
your red Christmas jumper which would be
so cute
these are gonna be so cozy I could
already tell and these were only twelve
pounds and the last few little bits were
just accessories so I have some Mickey
Mouse patches that you can just pop onto
your backpack or your Jack here and this
was at three pounds and then I have a
pair of little foot lips with a Minnie
Mouse Pony and these were two pound
fifty and the last thing that I got sent
is this little cute LED light with a
Mickey Mouse like on it and this was
five pounds and again this is gonna
so cute for my new house and so excited
that is all for my little Primark haul I
say little but that was probably the
biggest Primark haul I've ever done
feel like I've been rambling for so long
as well sigh hope you guys don't mind

Mickey Mouse and just everything in
general that I showed you guys in this
