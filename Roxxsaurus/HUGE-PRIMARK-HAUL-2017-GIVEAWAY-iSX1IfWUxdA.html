thought I would do a see guide in this
video i'm also doing a little giveaway

these so that is that and without to
ever do it let's get into the video so I
hope you'll acquire a lot of things and
if you have two bags full of clothes and
the first thing I honestly have to pick
up is this a jumper and it's actually a
Harry Potter jumper so it's got the
Gryffindor sign on it and I absolutely
love it my husband's Gryffindor so I
thought this would just be perfect to
support my house from Harry Potter and
this little bad boy was how much for you
it doesn't actually have a price but I'm
pretty sure owns around 12 pounds is not
bad at all
the next thing I got is another jumper
and this one is actually a NASA jumper
I've always wanted one of these but I
never got around to buying myself one
it's got a really nice like us that
slide on the side and this was also 12
pounds like your this is really easy to
wear you can miss you throw it over
anything it will suit any outfit would
like just plain jeans and it's super
comfortable is really soft as well
following honor with a Harry Potter
theme I also got this little Derby
t-shirt and got the Harry Potter and
Hogwarts logo on it and I'm honestly
gonna wear this as like a pajama top but
I thought it was just so so cute and
this was about six pounds okay you don't
know I must have some Harry Potter site
of course also how to get some soft so
this is a full pack of four pairs of
socks and in here just literally all of
the different houses you've got rip
endorsed Slytherin Hufflepuff and
ravenclaw I'm honestly going to be
reckoned leave every single day I then
went into my new t-shirt section and I
picked up like a lot of teachers I'm
always a person that always buys at
loads and loads of tops because I feel
like they're just such an easy thing to
wear so I got one of these and this is
the inner vanity over
you know that this t-shirt is like baby
pink I feel like honestly this has been
such a nice color recently to wear very
on trend at the moment if you are here
from the beginning of my channel you
will know that I love it Navona
I don't listen to it as much as I used
to first still love it it still holds a
deep place in my heart so yeah I picked
up one of these I feel like you've been
really messing with my hair at the
moment and this is only eight pounds and
then it ends up another line dusky pink
kind of top and this one says off-duty
when I saw this only thought that it is
very much like vans like advanced kind
of t-shirts in the default and on the
back it said schedule New York City
London Milan and Paris and I absolutely
love this stuff
it honestly matches my hair color like I
feel like if I wear it would detect a
little clash a little bit but once the
hair bushes out I feel like it will look
really nice with my blonde hair again
but I please excuse my voice like I feel
like I'm going to get quite a few
comments saying like oh my gosh it
smells very weird I haven't in recently
so that is why I sound quite like
nasally and just a bit like raspy throw
it up just to clarify that's why I sound
a bit but anyways I go another top and
this one is another like dusky pink but
this is a little bit more cream and it's
got like a really nice rose kind of
thing on the front and then on the back
it's got like a huge one of them and
then it says San Diego well to United
States and I've already been loving like
these really graphic t-shirts at the
moment I feel like never eat in they're
very easy to like I say like they're
just so so easy to throw on and this
once again at 6 pounds which is super
affordable but I always wander around
through the t-shirt section I came
across at the Disney section and the
Disney section is honestly why probably
spent like half an hour in and this it
worked except from the Disney section
you guys know I love Disney and this is
in the summary table like do I need to
say anything else
I freaking love Little Mermaid and when
I saw this I was like oh my gosh I have
to have this feel like this is a really
cool top as like a pajama top but I also
feel like I'm gonna wear it into summer
quite a lot cuz it's very colorful and
this was a just six pounds which is so
portable vibe and just love it so much
it also has like Cinderella tops in the
Disney section so I was like what do I
choose but then I have to go
of my guts I just picked up the Little
Mermaid top the next that top that I
picked up is actually a long sleeve once
again I go into suiting the whole theme
of this whole ball is pink again like
I'm sorry I just have been loving pink
at the moment I feel like it's just a
really nice casual color to wear thing
with like pan and new colors so I picked
up this little bad boy and it's actually
got this really cool detailing on the
elbows it's got like a little slit I
haven't seen a top like this anywhere so
I thought hey I'm going to pick it up
and see how it looks and this was eight
pounds so I feel like it's really well
made for the price and honestly you
can't go wrong with like a plain top
that you can just dress up without
necklace or like a cute jacket the next
time I picked up is this little shirt
and it's like very on trend because of
this choker neckline thing and then it's
got like a plunger kind of triangle on
the chest it's very similar to what I'm
wearing at the moment but except the
shape is a little bit different at the
top I really love this because it's like
a really easy color to wear very
flattering on the neckline the tholos is
very cool fold-over effect and that the
bottom is quite like cinched in which is
really nice and this took 10 pounds
which I feel like if you went to Topshop
you would get this for about 20 pounds
so you know you're getting a really nice
top 5 pretty much how surprised I don't
pick up another shirt and I got this one
this is quite out of like my comfort
zone I don't usually wear clothes like
this I'm not too sure why it's just not
really like my style with my go-to style
but I really liked it so I thought I
might as well give it a guy who's only 7
pounds so yeah it's really nice I feel
like it's going to be really good for
like spring and Wonder transitioning
into spring and summer because it's like
quite colorful it's really bright okay
and not on the tops I feel like I've got
like a hundred bazillion tops I'm going
to move on to the jeans now I got two
pairs of jeans and the first one I got
is like this dark denim I feel like I
don't really wear dark denim very often
so I'm like okay spring is coming I have
to kind of break out my shell and start
like wearing new things and trying new
stuff so I got a pair of these they are
just like super high waisted skinny
jeans and this is in size 10 Primark
people like my go-to they fit
so so while I'm asleep fit me like a
glove I don't know about you guys let me
know down below if you get along with
Primark jeans but I honestly do they are
so so affordable these were only eight
pounds can you believe that like really
nice high-waisted jeans for just a
pounds like that is crazy
I'm heading pair of jeans I've got are
pretty much the same style that also
high-waisted but these ones are just
acid wash and these were twelve pounds
I'm now going to move on to the shoes I
feel like prime up is killing at the
moment of the shoes these are just
insane look at them they are just so so
beautiful they are like this really nice
wavy kind of great color choices on and
they were really comfortable as well I
feel like they're very instagrams you
know I mean and these were 18 pounds and
then got another pair of shoes these are
little bit more and a grungy like kind
of dark side I don't usually wear camo
but I saw these and I thought they're so
so cool they're library edgy which I
like and these were actually on sale
they were originally 12 pounds but I
only got them to six pounds which is so
that I was like really surprised that
they had these in my size it's not like
them make sure you pick them up like
soon because I feel like they're going
to go quite quickly I never picked out
some of socks this is just like a
typical seven pairs of shoes and socks
so these were two pound fifty little
Congo wrong socks aligned the best in
Primark the liner socks also underwear
underwear is so great in Primark pounds
and love bras underwear so I got like
this little bra let's set and it's in
like this really nice dusky pink color
you guys know I love dusky pink by now
so this is such a nice set I feel like
they're very like Victoria's Secret
almost but they're like fraction of the
price Brad I was eight pounds and then
the bottoms were just three pounds which
is really good I know how to pick up
another bra line but this one is black
and it's like a really nice that the
safety design and another back has got
like this cool crossover
better than if you guys can see that
really well but I really love this it's
just like so so pretty and this was 9
pounds so happy I'm gonna show you guys
what I got for like home bitch I went
upstairs into the
section and I pretty much loved
everything but I have to like stop
myself from buying half the store you
know so I only picked up three things
the first thing I got is this like
shower curtain
but it's marble you guys know I love
marble I feel like every every youtuber
loves marble so I got a marble shower
curtain I haven't even opened it yet but
this is pretty much of the design that
the shower curtain is going to be and I
realized I was only 5 pounds so you
can't go wrong right I have so many
candles to choose from sorry struggling
which scent to go for by ended up
picking up the wild orchid and honey
Florence
sweet aroma candle and this is up to 30
hours of burning it's also good if you
guys go to Primark really like trust me
smell this it obviously smells divine
like it's so good and another thing I
got as your life a lot of you are going
to love and you guys are probably like
oh my gosh I need it in my life and it's
like this really nice copper light it's
got a bulb inside but it's not actually
a real bulb it's like a little it's got
like a little fairy lights inside it so
when you light it up it's just like a
little coil of very nice but I own sins
