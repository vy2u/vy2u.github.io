a Primark haul did you guys like this
video and make sure you give it a thumbs
up just down below I'll never ever do it
let's get straight into the video so I'm
really excited because promo has
recently started to get invest like
summery clothes and their summer like
accessories and I love summer stuff like
yeah I can not work for summer so I
picked up a lot of like summery clothing
as well as some things appropriate for
this weather still and the bad guys away
picked up is is a really gorgeous palm
tree kind of like shut it's got like
puffed sleeves at the end it's really
appropriate for the spring and summer
and I love but I have a little pocket on
the side of oh it's so so cute I think
it's going to be really cubed just like
a casual pair of jeans and this chart
was at 10 pounds
thanks I had me some is this cute little
body it's like bright pink like it
doesn't shop brightly from camera but
it's like really bright baby pink and it
just says not interested at all on it so
much sass and I've never really had one
of these but I think it is really clever
because I always took my top in my jeans
and then when it kind of untucked
it really annoys me but this will never
untucked because it's like straps
between your legs so you're all good
also got a low back on the back
obviously and this was how much because
this was five pounds the next time I
picked up it slightly less summery but
it's more like night out tea and it's
this just simple black t-shirt with this
crossover design in the front I think
it's really like
where you can also dress it up for like
a night out or just like a dinner or
whatever I think it's really cool I
really like it it's also got quite a low
sleep which is good when you want to
like cover up a bit of your arms and
this was only six pounds what a bargain
next thing I got in this like Crocs
hoodie jumper thing I recently just
gotten into the trend a bit actually
bought another one from Primark a few
days back and it was like a really nice
minty kind of green color and it said
like Malaga on it if you watch my blogs
you would have seen that this time I
picked up a slightly more like wearable
color for every day it's like this movie
shade and it glowed at the back it's got
like these things that the fries also
got like this in a soft fleece which is
so nice to wear because it's very soft
and cozy and this was seven pounds which
I feel like for a good hoodie is not a
lot of money at all
and then it has something slightly more
colorful for like the spring and summer
season and I got this really nice like
lace up top so again it's like later at
the front kind of like the black one I
just showed you I think is really cute I
really like the color very like spring
and vibrant and happy and I definitely
need to incorporate more color into my
wardrobe I always say this but this is
definitely going to help me because it's
still quite a wearable color but it's
just like nice and bright and this was
eight pounds and a laptop I picked up is
this one here I don't know if you'll be
able to see it very well on camera but
it's like a navy color and has got like
this lace detailing all the way through
the chest area to sleep I think it's
just like really casual kind of goes
really well over anything and this was a
pound I'm not going to move on to the
bottom so I actually picked up my first
pair of shorts of yeah I'm so close so
excited it's just like this pair of
high-waisted distressed jeans they've
got like a load of rips on the front
which I really really like and I got
this in a size 10 if you're wondering
it's just a really nice pair of white
shorts very casual will go with anything
I honestly a lot of apparel and this
pair of shorts was how much where you
can't actually see okay this was 10
pounds so not a lot so please probably
get this exact same pair of shorts in
top
for like 30 pounds and this is oh
because pound yeah I then also went into
the jeans section because I love jeans
at from Primark businesses mostly well
for me and I actually picked up a new
pair of jeans these are a very thin
jeans material and it will say the high
waisted but I don't really know how high
waisted they look because to me that's
kind of like low-rise I like my means to
be really high waisted but I think I'll
still be able to rock these I got this
is a size 8 and I just really love the
color it's just like a powdery pink
color you guys know I've been loving
this color lately so I was wandering
through the summer section I saw this
and I was so excited about the summer so
this in a giant inflatable swim ring and
it's a flamingo it's a freaking flamingo
I had to get it it's so cool I always
see like girls of Instagram like rocking
in their bikinis and in a swimming go
hoop and I really just wanted one I
don't actually know how practically this
is because I don't have a swimming pool
and have type don't where I to take this
I mean we don't really have a great
beach in England but I'm sure if I go on
holiday somewhere I'll definitely be
taking this little fella with me and
this was only 9 pounds I think it was
reduce yet it was reduced from 10 pounds
so pretty good deal and now also going
to show you the underwear that I
purchased I don't know if you guys get
weird about this but I'm I'm final show
you going over our first set that I
bought is this little like brass at with
some knickers and this is only six
pounds like it's a pretty pretty good
bargain for like a nice set of underwear
it's called life it's really nice lace
detailing on the front I don't know what
it's showing up because it is bright
neon yellow and this is a typical color
that I would usually buy underwear and
this was just like a spur-of-the-moment
like yes I want something really bright
because it's spring and it was a really
nice big that they don't like just I'm
getting pumped for summer so the rest of
the underwear plot are more like
bralette and kind of like sports bras so
the first set is this and it's kind of
like a triangle sports right I've got
like really nice thick band and then
it's got the same matching necklace and
this was again oh this'll actually five
times so even cheaper it's so
comfortable I really tried this on and
it's on
the most comfortable bra ever and the
last key pieces of underwear that I got
I'm most excited about because long haul
adorable they are they really reminds me
of like Calvin Klein underwear so the
fact I got is it like this really nice
dark maroon color it again has this
really thick band at the bottom and it
just has New York City over and over
again and the NICUs are just matching to
that and I honestly just really really
liked a little more hanger and I'm sure
it's going to be comfortable as hell and
I just got the same set but in pink as
well because you know I've enough
underwear next thing I'm really already
excited about you guys are you ready for
those are you ready
I've got many well is how adorable are
these oh my gosh so the reason why I got
them is one they're adorable too I
always see Instagram people wear these
in my Disneyland and it would make me
very very jealous because I've never
been to Disneyland and look how adorable
they are I'm so thank you I wish you
want to wear them like out every single
day and then also got some funny because
you know spring summer the sun's coming
out so I got this really nice pair of
copper copper don't the copper like I
look copper so we've got these how
adorable are they I'm going to take this
thing off of them I'm going to be so
difficult to take off so this is what
they look like how cute I love them so
much and love the fact that you can
still see the shape of my eyebrows
behind them because a lot of fun glasses
that I buy they kind of don't show my
eyebrows and I'm just like don't know
how many eyebrows people only a
three-pound served bargain and I serve
laughs as I go aren't actually
sunglasses but it's these a clear one
I've been seeing these kind of glasses
all over the place on the internet and I
just thought I need to jump on the
bandwagon so need to be like the cool
kids so I got those I think there are
actually really really cute
even though they don't serve any purpose
at all I just think they make me look
very smart indeed I had also picked up a
pair of shoes
I need shoes I don't actually have that
many pairs of shoes believe it or not so
I got these little like I don't even
know what they're called low sir sell
shoes my guess was like a little Cassidy
bear and they're just like Payton nude
kind of color and these are only ten
pounds so you cannot go wrong with that
they're just so so adorable I love them
I'm definitely going to be wearing these
a lot but I also start selling at cats
so I picked one up because I'm basic AF
so I got this one here it's like a knife
and it is not a good mode I already have
like a really nude one so I thought
let's get a brown one to see if it just
see if it works for me okay guys know I
kind of struggle with me because I don't
know how people wear them it kind of
just looks really weird on me I don't
know if I like it would you guys think
how you wear these things I just don't
know if I pull it too far down it looks
like my head tiny but if I pull it too
far up it just looks like that or I
could just wear like this and be a
gangster that's how I roll sim please
please as this hat definitely not be
here these sleeves I actually also got
this top here that I'm wearing from
Primark to it just looks like this it's
like a really nice like Belle's new kind
of top it's very different to what I
usually pick up so I like ten I picked
it up and it's also like a new deep
helping which I think you be obsessed
with these days anything okay so is
possibly one of the cutest bags I've
ever seen and it's this little black bag
and it's got like your Beatles and
ladybirds
in like gold on the front look how cute
that is that is so adorable and this was
only 7 pounds and when after the home
section and I picked up this little bad
boy and it's a little diffuser is
pineapple and coconut I honestly was
solved by the packaging to be honest I
don't even know how this smells and this
load of food that was only three pounds
as well and I'll ask you made up from
like the beauty section so the first
thing I got is actually a men's perking
so I got this format because he was
there with me and we dismiss it and we
were like oh my god this actually smells
like a high-end purse
and this is only three pounds I think
it's just like a really nice travel size
Parfum for men and honestly this smells
amazing like I don't know how to even
describe it but if you have a boyfriend
and defo buy this for him because it
smells really good and the other thing I
got is like a blending brush it's one of
these like little toothbrush things so
basically like a dupe for the artiste
brush and I am really keen to try this
this is only four pounds and they have
like all kinds of sizes shapes whatever
you need they've got air but I picked up
this one for foundation so they don't
actually have a really good brushes
foundation
so I thought I'm going to give this one
ago but that is all for my Primark or I
really hope you guys liked watching this
video I really love doing big videos and
watching them as well because it's a
really nice way to find out what they're
