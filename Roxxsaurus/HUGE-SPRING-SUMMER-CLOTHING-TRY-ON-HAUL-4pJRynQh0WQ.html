Hillary channels so in today's video as
you can see by the title we're gonna be
doing a huge summer slash spring
clothing haul you guys know I've really
been enjoying making up fashion videos
lately so I really hope you guys are
enjoying them as well in today's video I
went to a bunch of different like stores
and I just did a bit of shopping to be
honest and I thought I'd show you guys
because I picked up a bunch of new
clothes I thought some of these pieces
are quite on trend as well so maybe you
guys will get some inspiration for the
new season if you guys are enjoying
these fashion videos maybe make sure you
give this video a big thumbs up and also
don't forget to subscribe if you are
brand new bow without further ado let's
get on into the video okay so to start
this video we're gonna start off with
accessories actually I feel like I never
start with accessories so we're gonna
switch things up today so I just are I
actually have a bunch of the glasses to
show you but this video is actually in
collaboration at with glasses usa.com if
you guys have never heard of them before
which I'm sure you have they sell a
bunch of glasses as you guys know I
don't actually wear glasses with
prescription so these are only for
fashion purposes however if you guys do
need a prescription glasses you can add
prescription and lenses on to most of
these frames which is really cool so the
cool thing about glasses usa.com is the
fact that they have so many prescription
and sunglasses to choose from I think
they let you have like all thousand to
choose from which is just insane there's
a lot of choice so the really cool thing
about glasses usa.com is that they offer
78% off of retail prices which means
that you can get lots of cool different
brands that are quite high-end for a lot
cheaper for example I have a pair of Miu
Miu glasses right here which would have
cost so much if I bought them directly
from you me but this will actually a
really good discount meaning they are so
much more affordable but they also have
a bunch of in-house brands as well that
are exclusive to glasses usa.com so
these are the first pair of glasses
these are so dainty I actually love them
and they're also copper and nude which
is right up my street oh my god that's
so cute I really really like that so
these are the next pair these are the
new Miu glasses which are kind of like a
cat eye shape and they're just really
really cute and they have a
black rim which I absolutely love I love
these oh my god this so cute I love like
fashion glasses I sometimes wish I
actually had prescription glasses so I
could wear these all the time the really
cool thing about glasses USA is also
that they have a virtual mirror on the
website which means that you can
actually try on their sunglasses by
uploading a picture of your face and
then just literally overlaying any
sunglasses you like over them to see if
you suit them which i think is just such
a cool feature on the website
look at those these are adorable these
are like gold all over but then they
have like a brown half frame and then
the rest of it is like exposed lens
which I just think is adorable and again
these are quite dainty I feel like my
style of glasses is quite minimalistic
this is the next pair these are the muse
X Hilary Duff which I literally love
like look at the packaging it's like
peach I love it and these are the
glasses again a very minimalistic but I
love this sort of style and neither what
they look like on again I feel like
they're so minimalistic I love this
style of sunglasses and glasses in
general because they're not too
distracting like they just I don't know
they're just so complementary to the
face I think this is the next pair oh
these are the sunglasses oh my god I
love so these are like cat shaped
sunglasses I don't know if you guys can
see and they are quite reflective but
they're like rose gold oh my god I am so
taking these on holiday with me so those
are all of the glasses I am literally
obsessed with this pad I'll have all of
the glasses at linked down below if you
guys want to pick any of them up I think
that's so cute and so adorable
in fact I want to know how many of you
actually wear glasses I have a pole
right here so let me know if you guys
wear glasses or not and also let me know
in the comments because I feel like
you'll be quite interesting to see but
now let's move on to the clothing I
actually don't know where to start
because I went to a bunch of different
shops when I went shopping and you know
what I think I'm gonna start with
Primark actually I think I went to three
different places in total so let's start
with pride good old Primark
so this is my bag and I actually have to
say when I went to Primark this time I
didn't pick up as many things as I
thought I would because
I don't know I always end up buying so
much stuff from prime up whenever I go
but I feel like maybe I went too soon
since my last visit so I haven't
actually seen that many new things but I
still managed to pick up a few cool
things that's so the first thing that I
saw was this little top which I thought
was just perfect for summer I can
totally see myself wearing this in like
a really hot country with some shorts
and like some sandals or something I
don't know but I just really like tell
oh how interesting the pattern on it is
and you guys know I love anything Bardot
to be on here so I got this for 4 pounds
which I feel like it's such an
affordable price for a little top like
this and I got this in a size 8 then the
next thing I got is a pair of shorts
which I actually feel like would really
suit that top I just showed you and it's
these so these are like cream a
high-waisted ripped shorts these are
only 10 pounds which again is just so
foldable like I just love how affordable
Primark and then got another pair of
shorts which was kind of like in the
summer section do you have quite a lot
of summer pieces at Primark so when I
saw these I was like again you're coming
home with me because I just love them
they're like kind of crochet like they
have like crochet details or maybe bust
Lakes I don't really know but these cost
four pounds and these are so flowy I
love the little tassels yeah I just I
don't know I felt like these would be
really cool to like wear at the beach or
something and again for four pounds you
cannot go wrong is so affordable the
next thing I got is this little top from
Primark now I saw this and I kind of
fell in love with it but I'm not so sure
if I'm gonna like it now because it has
like this tie effect in the middle which
is really cool but it just means that
it's quite exposing I don't know it's
kind of hard to show you guys but when I
try it on you'll see what I mean
but this was only ten pounds if it
doesn't fit I can always return it but I
did quite like the pattern I just
thought it's quite a nice summery top
and the last thing that I picked up is
this little straw hat from Primark now
this was four pounds which again is so
affordable but I can remember I feel
like I had this hat last year but I
if I lost out on holiday actually so I
feel like I just needed a new one I just
love how these look paper like some
shorts it's just so like summery and I
am going away on holiday I think in July
I know I'm gonna need this hat so I just
pick this up as well I would show you
how this looks on but I do have a bun at
the moment so I can okay so that was
everything from Primark the next place I
went to was a river island so I've got a
little bad from River Island as well so
the first thing that I picked up from a
river island is this top right here I
absolutely love this I loved hops that
are ripped and look like this what drew
me in to this top is the fact that the
hem of it is kind of like thrilled and
so are the sleeves which i think is
quite unique and I really liked it so I
picked this up this was 22 pounds and
Hydra for one-minutes a little bit on
the pricey side for a top but I
definitely think it's worth it because
the quality is really nice then the next
thing that I got from River Island is
this little denim top so this is kind of
like a tire denim topped with a bit
sequins on it again it's got quite
interesting sleeves they're kind of like
large but they're like sure which is I
don't know how that's gonna look on but
I thought I'd give it a try and I'm
really likes it I actually got this in a
size 6 although I'm personally a size 8
but this top is quite big already and I
don't really want it to swallow me so I
got it a size smaller and I just really
liked it that was quite unique and
interesting and denim is so big like
every summer so you can't go wrong with
denim and the last thing they got from a
river island are a pair of trousers so
these are like these nude tie up sort of
trousers they are quite cropped I think
as well and they just have like a little
slit at the bottom which is quite nice
these actually have pockets as well
which is so cool and these were 36
pounds which I guess is a little bit on
the pricey side for trousers it's not
really like your typical price that you
pay for trousers but I really like these
so I don't know I just kind of felt like
they're a cool staple piece to invest in
so that's why I got these as well and
this color is so perfect for spring and
summer like anything past all nude pink
is like so in other moment a lot of
place I went to is outfi
so outfit if you guys don't know have
quite a few different brands they have
my Topshop Miss Selfridges I think as
well I actually got quite a few pieces
from Topshop which I haven't actually
shopped at Topshop for a long time so
when I went in there I was like oh my
god I remember I remember how much I
loved you the first thing I got is a
pair of shorts which look like this
these are a while how much oh they were
actually 28 pounds which it's kind of
affordable for shorts from Topshop
especially these are really nice quality
they're like really thick sturdy denim
and they also have like a really cool
frayed and which I really really liked
and I just love a Topshop fit like
Topshop Jony jeans are the one so I just
knew these would fit really great if
you're wondering these are called the
kiri or scented high-waisted it's super
short next thing I got is a little bag
from Topshop which I actually don't
really buy bags that often so when I saw
this I was like I need to get it this is
so pretty
so at this cost 27 pounds and again it's
from Topshop it has the most gorgeous
gold chain and I just love they like
embellishing and embroidery onto the
actual bag it kind of just comes undone
like this and this is what it looks like
inside I just love this it's kind of
like a faux suede material like overall
so it's really nice to the touch and I
just felt like this is some colorful and
just perfect for spring and summer so I
had to get it I then got this little
t-shirt from Topshop which says a
Heartbreak Hotel and it's like bright
pink and it has the red text over it
which is kind of like sort of like a
fleecy material or felty material I'd
say I just really like this I feel like
this tied up with those shorts I showed
you earlier would just be such a cute
outfit for summer and this top cost 25
pounds which I would say it's a little
bit pricey I'd probably only want to be
paying like 15 pounds for it but Topshop
you have my heart so I had to get this I
then got another pair of shorts a from
Topshop which look like this I
absolutely love these these have like
little flowers embroidered all over them
on the back and front I actually don't
know how much these cost they don't have
a label but if you're undoing it these
are the Topshop motto
mum shorts in size 8 but I'll have all
the links down below so you guys can
check them
as well then the next thing I got is
this is a tall cropped jumper and again
is this sort of really nice a nude slash
pinky color this is probably the softest
jumper I've ever felt like it's so nice
and cozy and it's also lined with fleece
on the inside so this would be perfect
for like the coldest summer nights and
you're a little bit chilly but you want
to like throw something on that still
quite summery thank you so this is
perfect as it's quite cropped and on the
embroidery on the side it says uh-huh
Kim K would be proud and the very last
thing I picked up is this a dress from
Topshop I'm not really doing it justice
as I hold it up but I love the color
again it's so spring and summer just
love this sort of like pastel pink color
it's kind of low-cut so I'm hoping it's
not gonna be too revealing but we'll
give it a go in the Train par and this
was actually only 29 pounds which I feel
like is quite affordable for a dress
like especially of this a nice quality
but that is everything that I picked out
for my spring /summer haul I really hope
