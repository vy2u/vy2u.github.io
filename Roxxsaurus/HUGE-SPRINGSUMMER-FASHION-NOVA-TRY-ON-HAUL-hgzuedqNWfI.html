my channel so in today's video as you
can tell by this title we are doing a
huge fashion over try on haul I am so
excited for this video I've actually
done a fashion / video like a few months
ago and you guys seemed to have loved it
so I'm so excited for another one if I
should never actually saw my previous
video and they were like oh my god we
love your channel so they actually
reached out to me and this video is in
collaboration with them which I am very
excited about because I loved some of
their pieces so I have only gone and
ordered about half of that website this
box is bigger than me you guys so this
clothing overall is pretty much like my
summer shop because I looked in my
wardrobe the other day and I noticed
that there's so many pieces for the
summer that I'm just missing so I
thought this would be the perfect
opportunity to pick up some new things
for summer slash spring if you guys
enjoy these types of videos and hauls in
general and make sure you smash that he
thumbs up little contour make sure you
smash that huge thumbs up and just
tumble oh I'm talking too fast and like
getting ahead of myself and also if you
guys don't follow me already make sure
you guys subscribe the button is just
down below but without further ado let's
get on into the video so fast these
first I'm going to talk about these
shoes that I've picked up this is the
only pair that I actually got and I am
just in love with them because let me
just show you these are just so cool I
am just oh my god I love the fact that
they're closed toed because I don't
really like open-toed shoes I'm just
weird like that but I really like how
like feminine this cutout on the heel is
and it also studded which makes them
like a hundred times more cool so I'm
really excited to like pair these with a
few more pieces and just kind of like
get like a really edgy sort of outfit
you know I love them before we go any
further the top I'm wearing is also from
fashion / and I absolutely love it I
just decided to put this on for the
video cuz it's so cute I then picked up
at this a little striped crop top which
looks really cool on the model it's
quite interesting I've been really
intellect my off the shoulder tops
lately so this is kind of very similar
to what I'm wearing at the moment it's
just like a V sort of cutout wrap top
it's quite corrupt as well it's got this
sort of thing going on just like the top
I'm wearing and I
thought this would be really cute for
like summer to just pair with some
shorts or something and I just thought
that this would top would make quite a
casual yet cute outfit so I got this as
well and this has also made out quite
like a stick and stretching material so
this would be quite comfy for like
anyone to wear really as you guys know
from my previous leg Tryon kind of
whores I'm well into my Reds at the
moment so I got like this little red top
I can't actually remember if this is
cropped let's have a look oh cool so
it's a long sleeve top which just says a
baby girl on it I thought this was
really cute and kind of right up my
street as well I really like the fight
when this has long sleeves because
obviously it's not quite summer yet and
we still need to have like those like
transitional pieces in our wardrobe just
to stay warm and stuff so I got this and
again it's quite cropped as well which
is nice with like high-waisted jeans now
to go with the crop tops I picked up a
pair of shorts there's that you never
enough shorts I think I have like 10
pairs of shorts which is kind of I mean
a lot when you think about it but I just
love my high-waisted shorts you guys I'm
always on the lookout for new ones so I
got these and these are quite cute cuz
they have all these little buttons in
the front and they've got quite a lot of
rips and like frayed edges so how much
were these as you can't remember how
much these shorts were but our of course
have all the prices on screen as I'm
talking about each of the items and if
you guys are interested I also have the
links down below so you guys can pick
these up for yourself so yeah I just
thought these were quite cute and would
go quite nicely where the crop tops I've
already ordered from fashion over next
up I've got some jeans you can't go on
fashion over and not order any jeans am
i right I'm pretty sure since the last
video I filmed you guys will know that I
was obsessed with the fashion nova jeans
that just fit me so bloomin well so I
got a pair of like little ripped jeans
these were 35 well $34.99 and they've
got so many like little rips which are
really cool they literally just fit like
a glove these jeans because they're so
like fitted at the waist which I
absolutely love I can't really find any
jeans that fit me like this on the high
street so I'm really excited that I
found these and I have to say the jeans
are pretty well priced as well
most like jeans on the high street cost
exactly the same but these just fit so
much better so I am really loving these
then got another little crop top because
you guys know I love crop tops with
anything high waisted to be honest so I
love this one because I really like the
color it's quite a simple little crop
top it's essentially just a t-shirt but
I really liked it because it has like
this square neckline which i think is
quite flattering though I picked this up
and I just think yeah it's just a simple
low top and I can just pair it with like
Shores or jeans literally anything and
it's just like wearable for everyday I
always need tops like that I like cute
but wearable for everyday the next item
is another little dress so this is a
white like ruched dress so again it's
kind of dressy but I always am missing
dresses like that whenever I have like
an event going on I'm always like oh my
god I have nothing to wear because I
live she hardly ever buy dresses or
anything fancy like this so I was just
like I'm gonna spoil myself so I got
this one right here and the reason why I
really liked it is because it's just got
a really flattering shape like it looks
literally dead straight when it's just
held up but when you put it on it lists
she hugs you in all the right places
like it gives you curves even if you
don't have it which is kind of what I
think about myself you guys have been
saying in previous videos that you think
I do have curves but I just don't like
my hips very much so I really like this
one it definitely gives me like a
flattering shape and I also like the
fact that it's got like little Bardot
sleeves which are just ruched again yeah
I just think this is the kind of thing
that maybe Kylie Jenner or Kim would
wear and I just think it's so pretty but
like effortless as well and then just
picked up some socks these are just like
a thigh high socks these are just like
one of these football cheerleader songs
I really don't know what they're called
but they're called the my BAE over the
knees socks and they have like little
black stripes on them and I just thought
I don't know maybe I could wear in one
day with like shorts or something I
don't know if these are gonna suit me I
just kind of picked them up cuz they
looked quite cute on the models I will
say the next thing I picked up is this
little body sue it's kind
like one of these like crotchy snappy
things and it's also got like her cool
lace-up cutout effect on the side but
what drew me to them is the fact that
they've got like really cool straps
which are quite thick and stretchy and I
just thought this would look quite cute
with just like simple jeans or something
and quite an effortless thing just to
wear in the summer like for everyday
sort of thing I have honestly gone a
crop top mad because I got yet another
one this again is more of like a t-shirt
cropped up again it's just like really
easy to wear for every day with just a
pair of jeans but again it's red because
I've been well into my Reds recently and
it's got like really cool straps on the
side like little white stripes um so
yeah just quite simple a rest top but
the fabric is really soft I have to say
okay this next thing I am so excited
about because it's one of these like
Teddy back home which I have seen
literally everywhere they're so on trend
at the moment and probably a little bit
late on the bandwagon here but I am just
in love they're so he's just got a
zipper all the way down literally I just
want to put this on right now why didn't
I have this in the winter this feels
like quite a lightweight jacket but I
feel like it would keep you quite warm
you can see why everyone's obsessed with
these jackets now the next thing I got
is this little thing right here I sure
don't even remember what I ordered it
okay so it's just like this little pink
crop top but it's like ruched at the
bottom so again just like a really
casual thing that you can wear everyday
I am so all about pieces like that I
have another pair of jeans so again
these were the same price as the
previous pair but I really like these
because like a dark denim just lit she
goes with anything I think like it even
go with this outfit quite nicely it's
time these jeans have no rips where
typing is quite nice as well because you
obviously don't always want to wear
ripped jeans for like special occasions
or I don't know if you're going like on
a meeting you don't really always want
to like wear ripped clothes yeah I think
these jeans will let you just go with
anything they fit so well again so I am
definitely given these a big thumbs up
next item is a pair of dungarees now if
you guys have seen a video where I
tested out a bunch of clothes I remember
what exact video it was in but I tested
out a pair of dungarees and
one of the buttons like snapped off so I
couldn't
fix it and I was so gutted so I ordered
another pair but these are like way
cuter because they have like a little
rips on them and they have like a really
cool big pocket at the front it's really
nice if you just want to put your phone
in what I love about these is that they
actually have a copper details like it's
got a copper button and then the thing
that actually attaches to the button
very nice touches I am sold
I love copper obviously spring is coming
it's approaching pretty soon and I don't
actually have a coat for spring like I
only have winter coats so I thought I
would pick this up this is just like a
really nice lightweight faux suede coat
and I love the color it's so spring it's
just like a really nice nude color which
I you guys know I love and again I feel
like this was quite affordable but the
material is just so nice and soft I can
tell that this is gonna keep me warm
even when it's a little bit colder but
it's not gonna like make me too hot and
bothered as if I was wearing like a
winter coat or something I am definitely
gonna get a lot of use out of this one
and the very last item I've picked up is
another little crop top but this one is
so cute in summary I just couldn't leave
this behind so this one is just like a
little tie up crop top which I think
will look so cute with jeans or shorts
and this was only $12.99 dollars which
is quite affordable if I say so myself I
just love the pattern I think it's so
like summery it just really makes me
happy like I love yellow so that was
everything that I picked up from fashion
Nova I really hope you guys enjoyed the
little bits I picked up but let me know
which one of these things was your
favorite I love the shoes I think that's
my favorite part from this whole they're
just like so cool and edgy as always

them up yourself as well let me know in
