look like I'm sweating it's because I am
hey guys how's it going today today's
video is going to be a summer clothing
haul from a bracelet I saw at first it's
going to be kind of like a one brand
clothing haul that I picked up way too
many clothes from my favorite photos
this is a huge bag I haven't even had a
look in it yet I wanted to pick up a
bunch of like summer clothes like more
casual things but also quite dressy
outfit in there too because I am going
away literally like in this week to
Portugal and also like just road trippin
with Matt like around Barcelona and then
like France as well so you have a kind
of like taking on the road actually I'm
going to be daily vlogging so if you
guys want to check that out you should
definitely head over to a rockstars
vlogs I actually also went to Ibiza with
I saw it first like last month so if you
guys haven't check that out you
definitely should prevail against so
much fun with them you guys enjoy
climbing holes that make sure you smash
a key thumbs upses down below and also
subscribe if you haven't already oh and
also click the little notification
button next time a subscribe button
because that just kind of like notifies
you every time I post any video ok so
the first thing that I see in the parcel
is absolutely adorable when I saw this
on the website I was like yes I need
this so this is what it looks like it's
kind of like a little place ooh but I
just absolutely love like the pattern
and the little tassel it's just so cute
and it's so me I am definitely going to
be taking this on holiday with me
because it's just so adorable and very
like holiday if that makes sense it's a
very holiday appropriate the next thing
I see is this little bar though top and
I notice like tiny bar with ear
stretches out like this is very stretchy
material I don't know I just really love
like off the shoulder kind of toxin
lately now the next item of clothing I
got in actually a two-piece so this is
going to be like perfect for the beach
in my opinion so the top is kind of like
a simple bando kind of pop that just you
know goes like this and then the bottom
is this maxi skirt so this is what it
looks like and I just absolutely love
like the Miss
Tyrael than its made out of it's made
out like this really sick so sick
material it's very stretchy and well
which is going to be so comfy and I just
love the color i get so pretty I look
all about the news lately and the skirt
actually has like this really big slit
on the side so I just feel like this
will be so cute on the beach this next
item is actually a pair of trousers now
I am a person that usually wears like
black jeans or just like normal jeans
and I just need to branch out though I
picked up this really cute pair of nude
trousers so they have like little
pockets but kind of like a cigarette
trousers so they're kind of a bit more
cinched in at the bottom they're really
cute cause they have like this really
pretty frill edging at the top and
they're just so adorable I can't wait to
wear these the next item of clothing I
am a very excited about because there
are two things I absolutely have been
loving lately and that is shorts and
yellow well this is kind of like a
mustard color but it's still yellow it's
still kinda yellow it's so cute so these
shoes are made out of like this satiny
very flowy fabric I feel like this will
be perfect for that like really hot day
where I'm just like I can't even be
bothered to wear any clothes so yeah I'm
just going to throw these on and I'll be
good to go we are absolutely adorable
and I just love the fabric like it's
such low quality and then picked up
another pair of trousers now I know
these are very like summer summery
trouser but there might be like a day or
two where it's a little bit more chilly
out there so I could wear these like
maybe in the evening or something with
an outfit so this is what they look like
they're just kind of like nude kind of
camel color they're very like flowy and
just really loose but they do have like
a really nice band here that you can
just pay up and it just cinches you in
at the waist and then they kind of go in
quite thin at the ankle which is nice so
they're still going to be a little bit
fitted while still being quite loose if
that makes sense and I have this in a
size 10 I don't know I just really like
them on the web side they're so cute by
the way I'm going to be saying so cute
throughout this whole whole because
stuff like the only word I can think of
to describe all these clothes okay so
this next item of clothing is a dress
but it's kind of
out there it's not really like something
I will use you work there's quite a
daring dress but I thought I would give
it a go anyways and this is what it
looks like
it looks very like I'm a confident kind
of woman which I use your web stuff
lenses props to people who do but I
don't like give it then you know maybe
one evening I'm feeling a bit more
getting on holiday and I just want to
wear something a little bit more edgy I
can tell that this is going to fit me
like a glove so I'm very glad that I
picked this up because I mean even if it
doesn't really suit my taste like you
never know you always look like a killer
dress in your wardrobe for that one
moment when you're feeling a bit more
adventurous next thing I got is another
pair of shorts so these ones are really
cute they're just like stripes and black
and white shorts they have a little
piping at the front that you can tie
into a little bow and yeah again they're
very like flowy they have a really thick
waistband which I really like and it is
quite stretchy - I've just been all
about the shorts lately because
obviously on holiday I like to wear
shorts because it's just a little bit
more comfortable than wearing a skirt it
doesn't blow up but it's still cute a
next top that I got is this one here so
this is basically like a ribbed tee
shirt it has this like choker detailing
at the front and also like a crossover
thing let me just show you that a little
bit better there we go so this is what
the front looks like it's such good
quality as well like it's a really thick
nice ribbed material it's not like thin
or anything so I picked this up before I
like a little bit more of a casual day
where I just want to like throw a top on
and be good to go I told you guys I am
literally all about the shorts in this
haul so yes again I picked up another
pair of shorts and this is what they
look like so this is the front and they
are just the most adorable short ever
they're so nice I saw these on the
website and I thought they just looked
so cute so I just have to get them and I
got yet another barrier because you can
never have enough shoes okay so the
notepad I picked up is just plain black
I don't know how well you'll be able to
see that these are really high waisted
so these will really like how you in I
thought because everything I picked up
is so like a light colored and new and
it's really
I would go back to my roots and just
pick up a black pair of shorts clothes
why not
and the very last thing that I got from
Isis request is a pair of shoes and
these babies smell really nice I like
how fast as me
I'm just really weird but I love the
smell of new shoes like I may smell like
a bit rubbery see I'm so weird so
basically and this is what they look
like they're kind of like espadrille
style shoes and the actual like main
part of the shoe is made out of this
like suede like both weighed grain
material and then what I love about it
is that it has like this really nice and
cool thing and that just straps around
your ankle and it has little gold studs
on it which is so super cute again I'm
definitely going to be taking this on
holiday with me special that was all of
the things that I picked up from I saw
at first
I initially love everything it's so much
and I'm very sorry about picking up way
too many shorts those love shorts okay I
