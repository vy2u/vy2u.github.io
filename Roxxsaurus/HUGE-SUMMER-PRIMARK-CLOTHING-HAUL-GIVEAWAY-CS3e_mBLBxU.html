channel so today's video is a massive
Primark haul I literally went into
Primark and I bought two bags worth of
Primark clothes which I'm so excited
about I literally spent like 200 pounds
I have the receipt right here we've made
a bit of a dent into the bank I'm not
gonna lie every time I go to Primark I
just cannot help myself I always find so
many little bits that I just love
everything is so super affordable that
you can't just help but get carried away
in today's video I also have a little a
giveaway for one of you guys out there
so I have a 50-pound a gift card to give
away in this video the rules to enter
this giveaway are pretty simple all you
have to do is obviously be subscribed to
this channel and the second rule is that
you have to be following my home
Westeros Instagram which is our ex home
where all of you might already know but
I am basically launching a home westdoor
with Matt and I'm super excited about it
it will be launching in a couple of
months so yeah the only other rule is
just to be following it down below I'll
link it right here as well as in the
description the last thing you just have
to do is just leave a comment down below
with your Instagram and Twitter social
handles so that I can contact you if you
are the winner but anyways I have so
many things to show you guys in this
hole so without further ado let's get on
into the video where do I even begin
with it no Alan went out into Primark
they had so many new bits for the summer
and Islay she couldn't help myself but
pick up a a bikini I know it's so like
premature I shouldn't really be thinking
about bikinis just yet as we're not
quite there in the summer season just
yet but I just knew that this little
bikini would sell out super quick so I
had to snatch it up basically this is
like a nude bikini it's like a triangle
sort of shape it has got padding inside
but I just absolutely love the color it
looks so expensive but this only costs
six pounds and I actually managed to get
this in my size which is size 10 there
was a lot of sizes that were a lot
larger which I feel like everyone just
when they saw this they just grabbed
their sizes and just went running with
it that is why this may not be in your
size in Primark but I really hope that
you guys can get your hands on it if you
are interested because this is just such
a beautiful set and also the bottoms
were the last pair in my size so I got
pretty
you lucky with this one and the bottoms
were only four pounds so I mean ten
pounds for this is literally not a lot
at all cause it's such a cute bikini the
next thing I got is this little dress
right here which is just like a yellow
wrap front dress now this is actually in
size 16 which is a lot larger than my
usual size I usually go for the size
eight in dresses but I feel like once I
tie this up it's just gonna kind of look
like an oversized dress I'm hoping it's
gonna fit if not outside we have to send
it back but I really love this it's like
a really pretty summery color and it's
also ribbed which are like two of my
favorite things and this dress was only
eight pounds so I just had to get it and
there was a lot of different colors as
well but I just really loved the yellow
you guys know I love anything yellow
next thing I got is a pair of little
shorts like this they have all sorts of
different colors in my last haul
actually picked up a white pair of these
so these are just the high waist ripped
denim shorts these are super affordable
as well they were only ten pounds and I
mean compared to like Topshop this would
just you know be so much more expensive
at Topshop so I feel like there are
really a really good pair of like shorts
to just pick up if you're you know
missing some shorts in your wardrobe
absolutely love the color as well it's
so like spring and summer and I just
feel like I need to wear color a lot
more this year next item I picked up was
actually kind of by mistake not really
by mistake but it was kind of like by
luck because basically I saw this
hanging in like this shoe section
someone must have basically picked this
up and then change their mind but I
actually couldn't manage to find
anything like this in store so I feel
like maybe this was like the last one so
it's basically like a long striped
jumpsuit it's like navy with like white
and nude stripes all across it it's got
like a tie as well and I love the leg
like it's really really wide leg and I
just really likes this I thought it
looked really expensive as well it was
quite affordable it was only 13 pounds
but like I said this was pretty much the
only one in store so whoever changed
their mind I'm really sorry but I got it
now you snooze you lose next thing that
I picked up are these gorgeous shoes
right here so these
basically like espadrille platforms I
actually own a pair that's very similar
to this but they are a lot higher than
these ones and I thought these would
just be really cute like we're on
holiday or something because they're
like really but like a manageable height
I'm not very good with heels even when
they're wedges
I just prefer a shoe that's more flat
because obviously it's so much more
comfy these were actually only 12 pounds
which i think is really good because I
remember I picked up a pair just like
this on ASOS and I think there were
about like 20 pounds or so next item
that I picked up is this right here so
these are basically like very very extra
jeans they're super vajazzled and they
literally have like gems all over and
pearls as well I just thought these were
so unique and I love like pearlescent
jeans recently like I have a pair of
jeans from she inside but you guys have
probably seen on this channel which I am
absolutely loving recently so I saw
these and I just I knew I needed them in
my life though these were 25 pounds
which is kind of pricey for like Primark
jeans a lot of their jeans usually cost
around 15 pounds or so but I mean the
pearls definitely add a lot of extra
sass so I still pick these up because I
feel like that a really nice like denim
like it's a lot of thicker than a lot of
the Primark jeans that they usually have
I feel like the quality is definitely a
lot better than some of their jeans out
there and they also have some really
cool rips so honestly this pair of jeans
it literally feels like the quality that
you'd get from like Topshop or a soft so
I definitely feel like the extra bit of
money for these jeans were well worth it
because they are such nice quality as I
was walking through the top section I
have seen so many t-shirts that are so
cute in Primark at the moment and when I
saw this one I just knew I had to have
it this was only four pounds you guys I
just feel like it's such a pretty basic
color like for spring and summer because
you know it's kind of just a little
extra like splash of color but in such a
wearable way like it's literally just a
t-shirt that you can like tie up or tuck
into your jeans and it just makes such a
cute outfit by itself quality is really
nice as well like it actually feels
quite soft considering it was only four
pounds so definitely a winner then got
this little pair of shorts which I
actually picked up a pair
like this but in a different color in my
last haul and I just love these so much
I feel like they're so easy to wear I'm
like holiday or even at home but I mean
we don't get that much Sun in the UK so
you'd probably be better off wearing
these on holiday as they are quite like
thin and just really flowy so these were
six pounds which again is just so
affordable and I just love how many
different colors of this they had they
had like beige black white and then some
other like really pastel II sort of
colors so I've got these as well and
then got a few crop tops you guys know I
am obsessed with anything that's cropped
to be honest so I saw this little crop
top which I thought which is really cute
reason why I picked this up is because
it's not just like a plain top it she
has like this white sort of edging
around it which makes it look a lot more
expensive than it really is
and again this was only four pounds
another crop top I picked up is this one
I feel like I have a thing for stripes
if you couldn't tell so this one is just
really cute it has like a little keyhole
detail at the front this was only three
pounds you guys how good is that I feel
like it like Topshop you'd probably pay
like 10 pounds for this but honestly
there's like such little fabric it
wouldn't even be worth it to be honest
but I absolutely love this and the fact
that it was three pounds just makes it
so much better next item I got is
another little crop top but this one is
so summery I can totally see myself
wearing this on holiday it's kind of got
like a jungle II sort of theme to it and
I really like it because it actually has
already a tie front which i think is so
like cute and stylized so you don't have
to do it yourself this would just be
really cute with like the pair of shorts
I showed you guys or even some denim
shorts so I absolutely love them the
next item I got is another jumpsuit so
this is what it kind of looks like it's
gonna be really hard to show you guys
but it has like a sort of cinched in
waist I really like this jumpsuit
because it has like a stripe all the way
down the leg which is just white and the
legs are quite wide I mean maybe maybe
not too wide but they're kind of like
pencil sort of trousers at the bottom
and I feel like this would look so cute
with this on like a dinner date sort of
thing and this was a 13 pounds
I feel like for like a classy sort of
casual but still put together outfit is
not a lot to pay at all they then it
ventured off into the section of denim
and let me tell you guys whenever I go
into the denim section of Primark I
always end up buying a denim coat so I
was kind of like really trying to
refrain myself from doing that for this
haul because I feel like it's just so
repetitive but instead I actually picked
up a pair of dungarees which I
absolutely love like I love dungarees I
feel like I just need to wear them a lot
more it's kind of difficult to style
Rhys sometimes and it also depends on
like what the shape of them is because I
feel like sometimes when you buy
dungarees they kind of make you look
like a boy that has like no shape you
guys get that like can you relate
because I don't know whenever i buy
dungarees I just feel like I have no
shape at all like my hips just look like
a plank but I feel like these are quite
cute and I really love the fact that the
denim is kind of like washed like
acid-washed denim it definitely adds a
lot to the look these are actually 17
pounds which is a little bit more pricey
than like your regular sort of Primark
prices but I feel like it's well worth
it because obviously the bottom half is
like long legs and it's super distressed
which makes it look a lot more expensive
like am i right so I just had to pick
this up I could not walk away from the
denim section without at least one item
the next thing I got is a set of pajamas
now whenever we transition into like
summer I always have to get like a
summer PJ's cuz I always wear like long
like long-sleeve PJ's but then I need
like a new pair so I picked up this one
and I mean I am just in love it is a
Minnie Mouse themed I absolutely love
everything about it I love Disney you
guys know this so basically the top half
is just like a cami sort of strap top
with Minnie Mouse on there and the
bottoms are the cutest thing ever
they're just like red polka dot with
like little frills how adorable are they
I am literally in love I am so wearing
these to bed tonight I just can't way
and these were only six pounds which
again such a bargain now the next item I
got it's kind of like a bikini sort of
cover-up but you could totally wear this
as like a romper slash play suit I don't
know what the right word is but
basically this is what it looks like
it's just like black and off the
shoulder it has got shorts but I really
like it because it's black and I feel
like for those of you out there even me
who only wear black but kind of wanna
venture out into wearing color this
would be perfect because it's all black
all over however you do get the pop of
color with these little tassel which i
think is so fun like I absolutely love
this I think it's like a really summery
place ooh but in such a subtle way so
this was 10 pounds which I feel like for
a nice little romper like this is not a
lot at all and I just feel like this
will fit so well over a bikini or even
when you can't be asked to like put a
whole outfit together this will be
perfect I then got yet another t-shirt
which it's just like a simple white tee
and it says Bonjour Madame and this was
already 5 pounds I just thought this is
such a cute like minimalistic top with
some like jeans maybe I could even pair
this with the dungarees I showed you
earlier the fabric is so soft like what
I felt this I was like you're coming
with me you're coming home with me now
guys as if one pair of PJ's wasn't
enough I actually got another one this
is actually for those colder summer days
let's just say that it's a boyfriend
cotton pajama set and obviously it's
like long-sleeve and like the legs of
the trousers along as well I feel like
this looks so much like Victoria's
Secret which I absolutely love their
pajamas anyways but this was fraction of
the price because it was only nine
pounds so can we just
it then picked up a pair of sunglasses
because I mean you can't have a hole
without a pair of sunglasses so this was
only three pounds and it's basically
like a pair of nude sunglasses with like
a gold sort of edging at the top like
can you see that and I feel like I'm
ready far away from the camera but I
absolutely love this I just love like
I'm a sucker for sunglasses and I love
it when you can actually see my eyebrows
over the sunglasses that's like one of
my big pet peeves when the sunglasses
hide my eyebrows because I feel it it
just looks really weird but these are
perfect they're like the perfect size
and the very last thing I got is just a
boring pair of socks I feel like I just
had to show you that because we're all
by socks from Primark they're the best 7
pairs for one pound 80 you can't get
better than that so
that is everything from my Primark haul
my bags are now completely empty I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and got to see some like new bits from
Primark I love doing these holes because
I feel like prema does have a website
but I feel like no one actually uses it

prefer watching holes and like watching

saw at Primark and actually liked and
all that kind of stuff so then you can
