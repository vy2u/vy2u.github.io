let's get on into the video because I
have quite a lot of things to show you
okay so the first thing I think I'm
going to start off with is home whereas
I've only picked up three things for
like home stuff arm so the first thing I
got is the cutest pillow ever this is it
and look how adorable it is it's so
pretty I love like this tribally kind of
like ass tech print on it but it's like
super girly it will go so amazing in my
bedroom I've been looking for pillows
like all over the place like a cute
pillows if you guys have any
recommendations for home wear shops let
me know down below because I love stuff
like this so much and I can never get
enough of pillows so this was actually
only 7 pounds which I feel like is a
quite a bargain because it's just such a
nice pillow it's really well made and
the quality is just really really nice I
definitely will see this on my Instagram
if I'm like taking cute bed pics
because this is just so pretty next
thing I picked up from the homo section
are these adorable little bulb lights so
these are called the 10 LED lights and
these are for indoor use these are only
6 pounds and look how cute they are
they're so adorable oh my god I can't
wait to hang them up in like my living
room or something and you can like try
them by clicking this little button here
that's so adorable and the last time
we're item I picked up is this little
pineapple candle I thought this was so
cute this was only 2 pound 50 oh my god
it smells so nice there's multiple
apples
obviously but I just thought the
packaging with so cute and the fact that
it's got like a little pineapple inside
is so adorable and I just love candles
so you can never have enough candles am
i right and moving right along I'm going
to show you guys that some clothes that
I picked up so I'm going to move on to
like pants but like pants slash shorts
so the first thing I got is this little
cute pair of shorts from Primark look
how adorable they are like really ripped
and really frayed which I absolutely
love I see shorts like this like at
Urban Outfitters and job and they're an
absolute bomb like they're so offensive
so I'm really glad to tell you guys that
these were only 12 pounds and yeah
they're just fit so well I tried them on
in the store and they were so nice but I
really love the fact that they have like
this really cool like metallic ring
around the pocket it kind of makes me
think of um when ariana grande put those
like a little metal rings in her hair at
the manchester concert that's a really
resin thing to say but yeah that's what
they reminded me of but they're really
cool I feel like these are gonna get a
lot of use and I just really like them
they're very like easy to stall and yeah
that's what I picked them up and the
next pair of trousers that I've got is
these ones here so these are actually
just like regular high-waisted pants
very typical from Primark and these were
only 13 pounds but the difference about
these is that they're like a really nice
nude kind of material and they also have
this really cool corset feature at the
front
I just realized they don't have to have
a button hey are you going to be able to
see my pants through these I didn't
think that through are you going to be
able to see what underwear
actually no you can't convened this
thing in the way that's good well I
thought oh my god these are so amazing I
really don't want to return them though
yeah they're just kind of a skinny pants
they're really stretchy too so I picked
those up and these were how much were
you 13 pounds moving on to it tops I as
you picked up a few tops so the first
one I actually saw a girl carrying
around in Primark and I was like oh my
god that is an amazing top I really
liked it I couldn't find it anywhere
does that ever happen to you when you
ever going to Primark and you see
someone like carrying an amazing item of
clothing and you can never find it
initially story of my life
so I actually managed to pick this up
right at the end by the till like
someone had left it and it was like oh
my god it was meant to be but this is in
size 10 which I was so lucky that
someone like who left it with a size 10
as well and this is what the top looks
like it's just really pretty I don't
know why I was so drawn to it I just
really liked it I feel like it'll be
really like pretty with just a regular
pair of jeans just a very casual kind of
outfit color isn't really a typical
summery color but I still really like
diving it's so pretty the next hop that
I bought is this one here and it's
actually just a very plain white kind of
t-shirt it's a little bit cropped and
what I liked about it is the fact that
it's got this corset kind of feature
again at the front so it just kind of
transforms a regular white top into
something a little bit more intricate
and just a bit more interesting so I
picked that up and I feel like this will
be amazing with those black shorts that
I showed you
yeah I just really loved it and this is
only a six pound so this next item of
clothing I got is actually I know it
kind of seems a bit more all terminal
beyster really liked it so this is kind
of like a t-shirt dress it's like this
green part and kind of design um I feel
like this is going to be quite a short
dress it will probably just go a little
bit above the knee um but I just really
liked it I feel like this will be really
like edgy to wear with like Doc Martens
or
be and yeah it's just got like a really
nice color and it got like no sleeves
which is going to be perfect for the
summer and it's just very like
lightweight and flowy pencils are only
eight pounds - again a big bargain and I
know I just I feel like I would see this
I like Topshop and it would be like so
much money but Primark you got me the
next item of clothing is another dress
and this one is kind of like a faux
suede material it's like a nudey Brown
any kind of color I don't know if I'll
be taking this entire day with me
because I feel like it might be a bit
too hot but we'll see um yeah this is
just a really nice simple dress it kind
of we'll go a little bit above the knee
I think and this will only ten pound now
the last item of clothing is actually a
coat so I realized it's not really like
a summery thing to buy buy here in the
UK it's still really cold somedays so I
picked up this denim jacket and it's a
little bit oversized I bought this in
the size 10 it's a bit quite big could
be quite hard to show you guys on camera
but I realized because it's very
distressed like on the back and she has
so many rents also at the front and like
the sleeve the rip and I actually saw
one girl wearing this at Primark like
she had it on it while she was shopping
and it was amazing so I was like hey I'm
going to give it a go and this was only
20 pounds which I feel like for a jacket
and it's like a really good quality is
quite heavy material - I feel like
that's a really good price for like a
really nice denim jacket I'm now gonna
move on to a pair of shoes that I picked
up from Primark oh my gosh
the third pair I am literally obsessed
with so this is what they look like
can we just they look so cool they kind
of like converse style but they like
believe pink like a blush pink color
like even the soul is pink and then the
actual material is kind of like a Swayze
material so I like completely fell in
love with it when I first saw them these
were only 20 pounds oh my god I feel
like that is such a good bargain for
these kind of shoots because they're so
pretty and the next pair of shoes are
slightly more like a light way and a bit
more for like running around so this is
what they look like they're just like
slip-on kind of like van style shoes and
these were five pounds oh my god that's
such a good bargain and again they're
like new so logo pretty much everything
and lastly I'm going to move on to some
accessories that I picked up I had these
in mind for like going away and going on
holiday so the first thing I got is this
little like summer hat um
okay guys not girls okay on there we go
this is what it will look like kind of I
think it's so cute it has like this
really nice buckle on the side which I
really like and this is only four pounds
which again absolute bargain the next
thing I got is kind of like an accessory
but it's more of like underwear I don't
really know what kind of category this
is in but it's like this strapless and
backless adhesive bra I bought this
because I am always like desperate to
find bras that look good with dresses
that I was like screw it I'm not going
to wear a bra at all I'm just going to
wear like these kind of like stick on
bras and so that I can get away wearing
like backless dresses and play suits and
things like that and I used to have but
one of these but they kind of like lose
their stickiness after a while so I
picked up a new one and this was a 5
pounds except I actually have a little
necklace which I feel like is going to
be so cute with like a really nice dress
or like an off the shoulder top so this
is what it looks like is something quite
hard to show but it has like this really
pretty
I don't know what that is like a really
nice detailing and it kind of like goes
down into these little too thin braided
I don't even know how to describe this
necklace but you guys can see what it
looks like and this was only three
pounds as well now lastly I have two
pairs of glasses so the first pair is
actually a pair of sunglasses and this
is what they look like I feel like the
pretty swanky if I say to myself so
people only three pounds I think yeah
there were three pounds there just so
cool they're like cat eye and the last
item that I picked up is these yellow
sunglasses so these I have been seeing
like every blogger and no mom where
literally look how cool they are though
these were only two pounds and let me
just tell you something I initially got
this same exact pair of sunglasses from
Miss pop and I initially got them for
like 10 pounds so I'm definitely
returning them because I literally got
this pair for two pounds so I'm not
going to need two pairs I actually found
this in the men's section would you
believe it like they didn't have it in
the women's section at all so you guys
ever go to prime out check out the men's
section because they do actually a lot
of cool stuff there too so that is all
for this Primark haul I literally love
