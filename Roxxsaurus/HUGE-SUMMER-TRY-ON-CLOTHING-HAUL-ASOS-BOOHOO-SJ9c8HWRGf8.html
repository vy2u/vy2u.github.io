a sauce / o zu / a pothole and this one
is absolutely massive so yeah I have
basically bought way too much that I
actually needed to but you know it's
summer and I don't know if you have
summer clothes while I explain myself I
haven't actually looked in this huge bag
for makeup yet so we're going to be
looking through it together which I'm
very excited for you guys enjoy this
video and also love shopping as much as
I do which I clearly do then make sure
you press a few sums up just down below
and also subscribe if you haven't
already I would love to have you here
come and join the dinosaur family but
whatever we do I wish you have so many
things to show you guys so let's get
into the video okay so I'm going to
start with a table since this is where I
bought most of the things the first
thing that I have here is this lovely
orange dress so this is kind of like a
summer sundress
this is what it looks like I think this
is such a pretty dress like I already
have any
dresses that I like this bright and
vibrant and because of summer I
obviously want to branch out a little
bit and wear more colorful things and
yeah it's just a very like simple dress
it goes around the neck like this I'm
pretty sure I can't actually remember
we'll have to look on the website but
the cool thing about this dress is that
it has this little triangle in the
center where your stomach and just kind
of like Pizza room oh hello and yeah I
just really like that about this dress
because it's very simple it's very like
casual but that little detail there is
so so pretty next thing I picked up is
another dress so this is what the dress
looks like I think it's so pretty it's
very like nice for going out but still
looking a little bit more casual like
not too dressy but you could definitely
dress this up with like a very pretty
necklace the other bottom it has like
this really kind of trimming and the
very very bottom of the dress which i
think is quite nice like I really liked
how this looks from the model on the
website but I don't know if it's going
to look that good on me I then picked up
another dress which is kind of similar
looking so it's pretty much the same
color but the design is slightly
different so it's more like cinched in
at the waist this one and it has like
these little pleat things here but the
material and the color is pretty much
the same I feel like I'm going to prefer
this design of the dress rather than the
previous one because I don't know how
I'm going to be a fan of those little
frills at the bottom but I really like
it I really like how it feels it's so so
soft and I think it's been very like
classy but like not trying too hard if
that makes sense
the next thing I got is yes another
dress I feel like I've been smacking in
like the evening dress Department
whenever I go out like if I'm gonna
holiday or something I never really know
what to wear to kind of like dress up so
I decided that I'm gonna branch out and
buy a bunch of dresses which I do not
know if they're going to suit me at all
but we will see so this is the next
dress that I picked up and this one is
slightly more girly and just like pretty
and more me I feel like this will be
quite long on me it's going to
definitely go over the knee and so it's
something very different to why I
usually wear but I really loved this
kind of like breast
design and also the little like Bardot
sleeves so yeah this isn't what the
dress looks like I really love how
pretty like the color is it's so I
passed any pink and it's very girly this
is actually by ASUS own so it's not from
a brand it's just from a sauce but I
think you're so pretty so I had to pick
it up and I can't wait to see what it
looks like on now this next item I kind
of bought in mind with the fat then
going on holiday next month I'm going to
Portugal which I was very excited for
I'm definitely going to be vlogging
every single day like I always am so I
picked it up this like sundress it's
kind of like a beach cover-up but it
looks like this it's going to be quite
hard to show but yeah this is what it
looks like it's kind of like I don't
know very like share but flowy which I
really love it's like so long look at
that
it's going to like blow in the wind and
I'm going to look so fabulous then it
kind of like tides over here just over
like your boobie area and then you have
like this kind of cropped effect but
it's all kind of linked on to the skirt
part if that makes any sense
it's so difficult to show on camera but
I will try it on for you guys so you
guys can see what this looks like next
thing that I picked up from a sauce is
this little palm tree crop top so you
guys have already seen this on my
Instagram I've worn it in like two
photos I think and that is because I
actually borrowed this from Lela when I
went to Ibiza she has this exact same
set and I was just so in love with it so
I had to pick it up and it also comes
with matching shorts so it's kind of
like a cord so I'm going to show you
guys and what the bottoms looks like so
the bottoms have at the exact same
pattern sash design on it and they're
just really cute they're high-waisted as
well and they have like this frilly
edging it's quite hard to show but yeah
they're really really pretty I'm hoping
that these are going to be like my side
because Layla's ones were quite like I
don't know they were size eight but they
were a little bit big on both of us so
I'm very hoping that this is going to be
the right size for me and if not I'm
going to have to return it and the
I suppose clothing that I picked up from
a source are these little white shorts
which look like this they're a little
bit crease because obviously they were
in like the bag but I really really
wanted something that would be quite
like flowy really comfortable to wear
specially when I'm on holiday the only
thing I would say about this is that
it's a little bit sheer um let me show
you guys do you guys see like I feel
like you will literally be able to see
my underwear through this so if I wanted
to wear this I'd have to wear it over
and bikini and like a bikini cover-up
because I don't think I could get away
with wearing these on like every day
like around the streets and stuff of
wherever you go on holiday okay so I'm
now going to move on to shoes from ASOS
I literally went ham with shoes I don't
know what went over me when I was buying
me but I guess I just don't really have
any shoes for like summer like I really
wanted some espadrilles but like high
wedge like high-heeled ones and so I
literally picked up a bunch I'm
obviously going to be returning a few of
these pairs because I'm not going to
keep every single one but I just wanted
to see which one I would prefer in
person so the first pair that I picked
up are these little wedges and this is
what they look like they're like a nice
nudey color blue they kind of match my
top but what I really loved about these
is the fact that they have this lace-up
thing so they laced up around your leg
like cross over these look very
comfortable and yeah I just really love
to the design I love the fact that it
has like a covering your toes I don't
know why but I just don't really like
people seeing my toes I never wear shoes
that have like a peep toe so I really
love the fact that they have like they
cover up your toes and stuff so
basically this is the first pair now the
second pair is quite similar to the
first pair it's pretty much the same
design of shoe up it is a little bit
different as you can see so this one is
like woven effect like the espadrille
effect whereas this one is like a cork
wedge cheese ones that don't actually
lace up but they do kind of like wrap
around your ankle like this which I
think it's so cute next two issues I
picked up
our another pair of like semi
espadrilles they're not really but
they're kind of like espadrilles style
and this is what they look like they're
again lace-up flats and so basically
these are from head over heels by dune
and so this is what they kind of sit on
your foot like they have like a xposed
heel but again they cover up your toes
which is really nice and then they just
lace up around your leg the string is
quite long so I'm going to have to wrap
this around my leg quite a few times but
I really love the way they looked on the
model so I thought I'd pick them up and
give them a go and pick up yet another
pair of espadrilles and like I said I
literally went crazy with the shoes
today so this is what the next pad looks
like they're kind of like platforms so
they have this flat platform all the way
around the shoe and they give you just a
little bit of height but obviously
that's still going to be very
comfortable just like flats they have
like this really cute trimming with
pom-poms around it which I absolutely
love and the last pair of shoes is yet
another pair of espadrilles I'm sorry
guys I just really love these again and
these are basically black wedge
espadrilles so these ones have this
really cool studded effect around the
ankle so they kind of set on your foot
like this the reason why I picked up
these as well which I realized they're
very similar to the nude ones it's just
because I wanted options like if I ever
want to wear a black outfit these would
go perfectly with those so that's why I
got these as well and the very last
thing that I picked up from a sub is
actually an accessory I usually buy
accessories and especially for the hair
so this is quite a weird thing for me
but when I saw this on the website I was
like how can I not buy this but
basically this is like a really pretty
tiara that goes at the back of your head
kind of like this now I'm moving on to
boohoo I picked up a few things that
from there as well if I think I picked
up from boohoo is this little code again
so this is the top it's kind of like a
bandeau effect with some Bardot sleeves
they're very like extra bottoms are just
basically a little high-waisted skirt
that matches the top and I
this is going to look so cute together
it's such a quick outfit to wear as well
so I definitely will be wearing that a
lot when I go on holiday
I got yet another color from boohoo
because I've just been so obsessed with
like easy outfits lately and so this one
here is basically like a two-piece once
again so the top is just like a bandeau
white strappy thing that goes over like
this um so this is very like sheer I can
already see like you can see my hand
kind of through it
um and it's also very tight like very
tight the bottoms are basically just
like these qalaat trousers that are
quite wide at the bottom and they're
kind of like cropped as well and then
this also has this little like belt
thing that you can kind of wrap around
into a bow I have no idea how to wear
this and they also looked a little bit
 I'm not gonna lie look at that I
don't know if I'll be able to like pull
these off but we will see next thing
that I got from boohoo is actually my
favorite thing that I have bought
throughout this whole like whole and
it's basically this little play suit
it's quite hard to see because it is
black but this is what it looks like
it's just like a short shorts and then
it also has long sleeves which is quite
unusual for a playsuit to have so this
is such an easy thing to wear as well I
feel like this will look so pretty with
the black espadrilles that I showed you
guys a minute ago and the last thing
that I picked up from boohoo is a little
bikini so it's literally bright yellow
look at that so this is the top I think
the top is so like pretty and flattering
I love the fact that it has quite
stretchy material as well and it's just
very like aesthetic it's so pretty and
then the bottoms are even more
interesting this is more for like photos
and like fashion maybe even swimming but
it's definitely not for sunbathing
because you get really weird tan lines
with this but this is what they look
like so they have like this strappy
effect at the back and this is the front
I think this is such a cool design and
like I say you just gonna have to be
very careful with tan lines because
there would be going cray cray but I
really love this design and I've never
owned a bikini like this so I'm really
excited to art when I go
holiday so that is the end of my whole I
