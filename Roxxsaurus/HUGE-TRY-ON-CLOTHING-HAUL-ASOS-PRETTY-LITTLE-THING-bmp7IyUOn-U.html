and if you guys are having an awesome
day so far so today I am doing a huge
clothing haul for summer I have been a
little bit naughty and I picked up away
too many times when I should have and I
saw well this is a great opportunity to
let you guys know what is out there on
pretty little thing and a salsa that
I've been loving so that's why I picked
it up and I'm going to show you guys
what I got you guys enjoy closing homes
and would like to see more make sure you
smash that huge thumbs upses down below
and also subscribe if you haven't

if you guys want to be notified of every
time I post a brand new video so yeah
just hit that little Bell button and
next to the subscribe button and you'll
be notified every single time there is
actually so many clothes on the floor
right now and I cannot wait to show you
guys so let's get into the video okay so
the first thing I'm going to start off
is pretty little thing this is the bag
how adorable it's got like a bunch of
unicorns on it I absolutely love it so
the first thing from brittle thing that
I picked up are these and this one
shorts look how cute they are they're
like very parsley pink and the I'm not
too sure how high-waisted they are they
look like semi mid-rise but yeah I
thought I picked these up because I
actually don't own that many pairs of
shorts and when I do they're mostly like
denim or black and I've never actually
been chewed out and bought something a
little bit more colorful to wear on my
bottom half so that is why I got these
and these are called the Jade and pink
Freight edge and denim short I'll have
links and down below to every single
thing I show you guys so if you guys
like it you can pick it up yourself but
yeah these are just very simple plain
pink shorts with like a fray edge bottom
I think they look really nice and you
can just literally throw them on and
pair them with anything the next thing I
picked up from pretty little thing is
this little body here now this isn't
like a really nice dusty rose kind of
color it's very like I don't know very
on-trend very Movil which i absolutely
love this color lately and you guys
probably already know this but I got
this because I really
loved the neckline a bit like I love how
it's not a round neckline it's very
square and angular and I think it's
going to be super flattering or like the
collarbones kind of area and because
it's a body and it kind of like goes
around at your crotch area I feel like
this would be perfect to wear on like a
summer holiday because it's not going to
on top when you're wearing it with like
shorts or jeans and that's like one
thing that I love about bodies like the
super comfortable to wear could they go
around your crotch and it doesn't mean
that they won't untuck whatever you may
be doing the next thing that I picked up
from principal thing is this little
choker necklace so it's got like a
little heart in the center it in a gold
color which I absolutely love and I have
just been loving chalk rhythmically yeah
that's the tro tithing it's so adorable
the next thing that I picked up is like
this turtleneck kind of body it's going
to be quite hard to show you guys this
but I'm going to try it on for you guys
so you can really see what it looks like
on but I absolutely love this color look
how pretty it is I love that it was like
a little body with this kind of corset
II tie on thing on the front this has
been so popular lately like I've seen so
many people when is kind of clothing on
Instagram so I wanted to give it a try
and I think this looks really cool I'm
going to try it on for you guys and see
how it fits but I'm pretty sure this is
going to be like my new favorite top and
and back it's just got like two button
but yeah I absolutely love this it's so
nice quality as well the next thing that
I got from a presidential thing is this
huge oversized hoodie look how big it is
I can't even like fit it in shop so I
can already tell this is going to be so
comfortable and so cozy I'm probably
going to be living in this for like the
rest of my life basically a really
obsessive this kind of like tan greenish
color at the moment as you can probably
tell by this top as well but I
absolutely love this I can't wait to try
it on and see what it looks like
but I think this is going to be like a
really cute thing to just throw on and
you could probably even went as a dress
with like some really cute boots
depending on how long and this is going
to sit but yeah I love it okay so I'm
now going to move on to a sauce I am so
excited to show you guys and the stuff
that I got from a sauce so the first
thing that I picked
is actually there's a little brother
like kind of like a sport browsing from
Tommy Hilfiger I absolutely love it look
how cute is it kind of reminds me of
like the Calvin Klein brand but
obviously this just says Hilfiger on air
I just love bras like this I will
literally wear this over like a natural
normal bra any days because these are
just so comfortable and they are still
really really cute so I love this
because it also has that tiny little
like logo of Tommy Hilfiger on the back
obviously you're not going to see it on
the back but it's just nice to know that
is bad oh yeah this is it I love it and
this is inside at the next thing that
keeps up from ASOS is this again huge
oversized jumper but this time it's not
a hoodie it's just like a sweatshirt
kind of thing and this isn't like this
really gorgeous parcel II kind of violet
color but basically this has like really
huge sleeves look at that they're like
bell sleeves and I don't actually own
anything like this so I was like oh this
is interesting
so this jumper is actually not just any
plain jumper because the back is like so
cool because it has like this really
cool lace-up design at the back that
goes all the way down so that's like
really spicing things up from the back
toast like business in the front party
the back but yeah this is like really
huge and I love it this is going to be
perfect for like the slightly colder
days of summer because let's be honest
it has been raining so freakin much here
in the UK and I'm literally like where
is the Sun at like please please Sun
come out now the next item that I picked
up from ASOS is another jumper I know
summer and jumpers like what's going on
but like I said it's so cold in the
summer like you don't even ask me but
basically this jumper is actually
cropped so you can just wear like a cool
shirt or like a top underneath you can
just wear it with high-waisted jeans but
I absolutely love this because of how
fun all the little like beads are it was
so cute and all different colors and I
think it's like perfect for spring and
summer to like add a little bit of color
into your wardrobe but just you know
very subtly so this is the jumper I
absolutely
love it is so cute okay so this next
item is kind of weird it's not something
I would ever usually wear but I pulled
it from the website now like this is
quite cool so I'm going to see what it
looks like on if I don't like it I'll
return it but this is at the top so it's
basically like a retro sporty kind of
top it looks like a sports talk to me
and it just has another 10 on it I don't
know I just like the color I like the
combination I thought it was like super
cool and retro so that's why I picked it
up I might hate it on I might love it
I'm not too sure let me don't tell the
like what you guys think of the top but
I think it's quite cute it's very
different it's not really me but I still
really like it now emails are the
bottoms I actually picked up a two pairs
of jeans because we need jeans and a
soft have like really really cool ones
so I picked up there this little pair
here which is like a mid blue kind of
color and it has like a few rips on the
legs you guys know I love my rips as
long as they're like not taking it too
far
so these are quite like subtle which I
like and yeah these are like kind of mom
jeans I think I don't think they're like
skinny
they're quite wide on the leg so I don't
know if I'm gonna like these but I
thought I'd give it a go because I
usually love my skinny jeans and you
guys know but I'm going to give these a
go see if I like them and now the second
pair of jeans is actually bringing it
back to like everything that I always
wear which is just like a tight pair of
skinny jeans but now these look really
tiny oh these are in size s but I
thought they'd be like a size a but the
kind of looks like a size six I don't
know if I'm actually going to be able to
fit in these I'm gonna try I do have
quite a small waist but I don't know if
it'll go over my hips so wish me like
but these are just basically like light
wash jeans where that rips on the knees
they're very subtle again but I just
thought they were really cute and they
look amazing on the model so let's hope
these are going to fit and the last item
that I picked up from a self is actually
a coat because coats are like a must for
the summer even if it's like super hot
like and gets really cold during the
evening so I thought I pick up something
a little bit more like out
and like colorful and bold so I got this
suede well faux suede looks kind of coat
and this is basically like a biker
jacket like usually get this kind of
style in leather jacket but this is
actually made a faux suede so this is in
size 8 which is quite a small size I
usually get my coats like in a size up
like size 10 but I thought because of
the style and when to cut of the coat I
want it to be like more fitting and so
that's why I got a size 8 but I love
this like it's such a nice material it's
so soft and I absolutely love the color
I think it's like perfect for summer and
I have been loving like really strong
jackets lately any kind of jackets that
says yes I'm going to kick your butt
that's the con jacket I like so this is
why I bought this so that is the end of
my summer clothing haul from a self and
preservable a pretty little thing
so let me know down below what piece was
your favorite I love everything that I
got there might be a few pieces that I
send back because either they don't suit
me or I just don't really like how it
fits on me like size-wise but yeah most
of the stuff I really really like so let
me know down below what you guys think
of hauls and if you would like me to do
more in the future if you guys enjoyed
