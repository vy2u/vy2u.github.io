to begin I'm reaching for my snazaroo
water-based face paint and taking my
precision brush by Real Techniques I'm
just outlining the nose of the skull you
can make this any shape you won you can
make it as jaggedy or as smooth as you
like it can even be a simple triangle
it's all down to you I find it so much
easier to use a reference picture so
that's what I'm looking at now my
reference picture was actually a picture
of someone else's makeup that I found on
Google so this isn't my original idea I
am just sort of borrowing it from
someone else and here as you can see I'm
just outlining all the different parts
of the skull and then I'm going on to
the mouth and I'm just creating some
simple vertical lines down my mouth and
then I'm also going to be extending the
sides of the mouth a little bit and
drawing on some teeth onto that as well
I'm going into the center of my mouth
and just filling that space between my
lips with some black paint just to give
them off a little bit more depth next
I'm going to be reaching for my white
face paint and I'm just using a flat
brush to go over any white sections of
the skull make sure to leave the hollow
parts blank on each side
and then building up on that white in
the teeth just to give the teeth a
little bit more dimension
now I'm going back to the black then I'm
creating the hollow parts of the jawline
I'm then just tidying up that black line
separating my face from the skull mask I
am now going in with a real techniques
angled brush and I'm just sort of
shading the hollow parts of the skull
and then I'm also using that to outline
the teeth and just darken any black
lines
what are creating little tiny gaps
between the teeth just to make it look a
little bit more realistic then I have
reached for a black eyeshadow from the
Urban Decay 2 palette and I'm just
further shading that hollow part of the
skull
I'm then picking some of that black
eyeshadow onto a precision brush but
make sure you do this very very lightly
and then I'm just going over the teeth
or just to outline them a little bit
next time moving on to the bottom
portion of this skull and I'm returning
back to the white facepaint just to fill
everything else up
I'm now returning back to that detailer
brush and I'm just fanning out any of
the teeth and just creating little
shadows in between them
next I'm taking a slightly bigger
precise brush and I'm creating these
lines underneath the curves of the mask
and then I'm going back to my detailer
angled brush by Real Techniques and I'm
just creating really really slim sharp
lines
you
I'm now reaching for a fluffy blending
brush and I'm taking some black
eyeshadow just to shave above the line
that we created you want to make sure
that you leave that white line as a
little gap this will just bring that
section a little bit more forward and
make it look much more Freedy using my
Urban Decay primer potion I'm just gonna
prime my eyelids so that they're all
ready for the eyeshadow I'm reaching for
teeth as a crease color just to blend
everything out and I'm blending that in
with a big fluffy brush
I'm then going in with blackout and I'm
just applying that all over the lid and
create a smoky line so that it blends
into the t's Oh got something stuck in
my aiya always happens to me and then
using a flat brush to sort of line my
lower lash line and the inner corner and
then I'm just applying a mascara by
Bourjois
and that is the final work I hope you
guys enjoyed this if you do recreate it
definitely timing on Instagram I would
love to see your recreations hope you
guys have a happy Halloween this year
