leaving forgiveness for my wrongs I have
just begun a mercy hello everyone and
welcome back to my channel I hope you
guys all well so today as you can tell
I'm doing me Harley Quinn makeup
tutorial I'm so excited for this video
this is a collaboration with my
boyfriend over on his channel he is
Joker as you saw in the intro I think
his costume is absolutely sick so you
guys have to check out the video we did
over on his channel as well I'll leave
it down in the description as well as on
screen somewhere here so you guys can
check it out and see the second part of
this video if you guys love this look be
sure to give a huge arms up and
subscribe just down below and without
further ado let's jump right into the
video so the first product I'm going to
be using is that the NYX pore filler to
prime my face so that my skin is all
nice and smooth already for our
foundation now Harley Quinn has
sometimes really pale skin that's almost
wise but for the sake of this makeup
looking more like in the movie I'm going
to opt for a more natural-looking pale
skin tone using the l'oreal true match
foundation in shade ivory so once you
have your even pale complexion you want
to set this in place with a translucent
powder the one i'm using is called
primed and poreless and it's by Too
Faced moving on to the contour I'm going
to be using the Maybelline master
contour kits so I'm just using the first
step which is the contour shade and
applying this into the hollows of my
cheeks to make them look a little bit
more defined once my skin is all done
I'm now moving on to the eyes which is
the most exciting part and for this I'm
going to be reaching the NYX ultimate
bright shadow palette so the first thing
I'm doing is I'm taking the pink shadow
from this palette and I'm applying this
very messily onto my right eye and I'm
smoking this out into a bleeding effect
as if Harley Quinn was crying that's
what the makeup looks like in some of
the movie scenes so I thought I would
replicate this one and now that the blue
eye you are ultimately
the same step as you did all of the pink
eye now that the eye shadow is done we
can move on to the eyeliner and for this
I'm going to be using the Maybelline New
York master precise felt tip liner and
with this I'm going to be creating a
thin winged liner that's my winged liner
is complete I'm now going to add some
mascara to my lashes and the one I'm
going to use today is the Maybelline New
York the falsies push-up angel mascara
this is the new one to complete the
makeup with Hartley's signature red
lipstick I'm going to be using the urban
decay in rocksteady so now that the
makeup lick is complete all there is
left to do is add the finishing touches
which are highly Quinn's face tattoos on
her right cheek she has a black tattooed
heart as well as the word rotten on the
side of her jaw so I'm going to be
recreating this it would be Maybelline
New York master precise a felt tip liner
and that is the makeup look complete now
all there is left to do is grab my
Harley Quinn jacket my baseball bat find
my Joker and we can take on Gotham City
so that was all for my Harley Quinn
makeup tutorial I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you did please be sure
to give a huge thumbs up for me also
make sure you guys check out Matt's
video he did the Joker over on his
channel so make sure you check that out
yes all my costume details will be down
below so you guys can check that out and
you can recreate this whole look and
this bar I actually made myself
I just got a plain bat and just
basically sharpie doll this on it was
actually pretty easy to do so if you
guys are thinking of doing this for
Halloween just make one yourself it's so
easy but that is all for my video I hope
you guys liked it and I'll see you very
soon in my next one bye today I thought
I would do the famous texting lyric
prank video on my boyfriend tickets this
week go everywhere I call it send it i
Colin I actually called ok so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
