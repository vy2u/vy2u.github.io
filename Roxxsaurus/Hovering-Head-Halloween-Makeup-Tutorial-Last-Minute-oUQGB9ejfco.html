head makeup tutorial of Halloween I know
I said that my last Halloween story was
the last etre I was in a film but I'm
actually deciding to film one last one
before Halloween so I hope you guys
enjoyed this and if you do then
definitely give this video a thumbs up
because it helps me out so so much and
definitely subscribe if you're not
already also make sure to check out a
video that I did for a BBC news be on
Tino de Healy and I'll link the tutorial
following that I did on her down below I
did half skull and half
pumpkin and I think it's a pretty cool
look so if you guys want to check it out
then that will be in the description as
well
and one last inside I also did a video
on my boyfriend's channel and that's
where I turned him into Tate from
American Horror Story so I did like a
skull makeup and neck sort of makeup
tutorial so if you guys want to check
that out as well all the links will be
down below let's just jump right into
this neck tutorial so firstly I'm taking
a black eye liner and I'm just mapping
out where I want the cutoff of the neck
to be I'm drawing the round shape and
you have to bear in mind what the
perspective of this is going to look
like so you want to try and get it as
neat as possible and really take your
time with each line trying to make it as
symmetrical as you can
I'm then reaching for my black snazaroo
paint and I'm just popping that all over
the top of my neck and that's going to
create the illusion of a suspended head
whilst I'm doing this I'm bearing in
mind to leave a 1 centimeter gap between
the line we created this is going to be
the space where we put the white to do
the outline of the hole cut off neck
I'm not taking my white snazaroo paint
and I'm just tracing the outline of that
neck with white and this is just going
to create a highlight to this whole
makeup look and make it look much more
3-dimensional rather than so flat I'm
then returning back to the white face
paint and I'm just mixing some of that
leftover black and adding some white to
the paintbrush to create the highlight
of the neck so you want to think of this
neck as a tube kind of shape and if you
were to introduce some lighting it would
of course reflect off of the back of the
tube so this is what we're trying to
create for a much more three-dimensional
look
and then going back in with the black
and I'm going along the bottom just to
kind of add that depth back in then I'm
returning back to the white just to
clean up some edges
I'm then taking my sipping glory one
heck of a blot face powder and I'm just
popping that over to get rid of any
shininess from the paint
so that is all for my makeup I hope you
guys enjoyed this look I think it's
super easy and it's really cool for like
a last minute Halloween make especially
for trick-or-treaters and stuff like
that I think it's pretty cool and it's
fairly easy to do so I'm sure all of you
will be able to do it if you do recreate
it then definitely tag me on Instagram I
would love to give you a photo alight
and follow you and all that good stuff
so definitely do that I hope you guys
are gonna have a lovely Halloween and
I'll see you very soon in my next video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
