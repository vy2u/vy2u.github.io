today I'm going to be filming a video on
how to get rid of acne scars and I'm
going to be showing you a little tool
that I use to get rid of my acne scars
and I know a lot of you guys are young
so you might have problematic skin er
this kind of age and I know that having
acne sucks so bad and you always get a
little scarred after you have a spot or
a pimple so I feel like this little tool
is quite useful and I would like to
share with you guys now before we jump
straight into this video I will say that
this video is sponsored by PMD and
that's the tool that I'm going to be
showing with you guys in a minute
but if you guys do not like to watch
sponsored videos then that's truly fine
I get that so you can click off this
video if you want but I will say one
thing and that is I get a lot of offers
to review products and I get a lot of in
sent to me but that doesn't mean that
I'm going to share every single thing
with you guys if I don't feel like it
will benefit any of you or if I don't
genuinely like it so everything that I
see in this video is definitely my own
opinion so I'm not being paid to say any
of this at all and I'm just gonna speak
my mind so now that's out of the way I
will be showing you guys what I used to
get rid of my acne my skin is pretty
good too these days I mean again the odd
pimple here and there sometimes but at
the end of the day I am 19 years old so
I sort of passed that a period of my
life when my skin was very problematic
but just because my skin tends to be
clear now that doesn't mean that I
didn't go through what you guys may be
going through a younger age in my life
if I had known of this tool at that age
I definitely would have found it very
helpful because it was a pain so that
I'm going to be talking about today is
called PMD and that stands for personal
microderm and what that is is basically
an at-home treatment with clinical
results so basically what this tool is
you should do is achieve personal
microdermabrasions all in the comfort of
your own home so you don't have to go to
a clinic to get it done and it actually
tends to be much cheaper and you do get
your money's worth by using this little
tool only a few times so so what the
little device looks like is just this
little thing here and you
you get a cable to plug in and plug into
your wall and then you have this little
end here and you can actually take this
off by screwing off like this and there
you have the little disc inside so you
can actually change these discs and
they're just like little tiny knobbly
bits and what you do is you just take it
out and you replace it the first disc
you get is a white colored one and
that's the starter disc so it's the
least harsh on your skin so this is just
allows you to see where you are on the
sensitivity scale and it's not harsh at
all but then you can get more harsh ones
if you want so by taking this off you
can replace this with any disc you like
so you could replace it with some bigger
ones to use on your body and you have a
set to show you guys actually and this
is the body kit replacement discs so
it's got different discs that you can
use on your body to say you've got some
scars or some acne on your back you can
use that and cover a larger sort of area
in shorter periods of time because if
you were to use this tiny little thing
on your back it would take forever so
these are designed for your body so like
I said it also comes with different
types of discs um I've got a few here
and these are I believe just different
sort of harshness on the scale of like
sensitive to not very sensitive and just
sort of gradually build up the harshness
of these little discs and they're
exfoliating power as you go along and
here's one of the bigger ones so just to
compare the sizing as you can see this
one's a lot larger than this one so I
will actually show you guys how to use
this tool it may sound a little bit
harsh and scary but don't be frightened
by it it really doesn't feel like
anything he just feels like a little
scraping across her skin so nothing
painful at all so basically what this
device does is it rotates at the little
exfoliating disc really quickly so when
you press it against your skin it just
gets rid of the first layer of your skin
it sort of like scrapes it off it may
sound a bit scary and harsh on your skin
but don't worry it's not at all and
because the first layer of your dead
skin is removed - it allows your
products to be absorbed much easier and
also any ugly scarring will soon
they're after using this tool a few
times and most acne scars are actually
the most pigmented right at the surface
of your skin so once you get rid of that
and you use this treatment a few times
it will go away much quicker than it
would without using at all
this is especially really good for
people with dry skin like me I tend to
get really really dry skin especially
around my chin and my nose area and what
this does is it just helps to get rid of
that dead skin that doesn't need to be
that kind of thing and it just gets rid
of those dead skin cells much better
than any exfoliating skin wash would do
so because you are using this to to
basically scrape off any dead skin cells
you want to make sure that you're not
going over the same area twice because
this can cause irritation to the skin so
you want to go over one area once so I
will show you a little demo on how to
use this tool because you guys are
probably confused right now so I will
show you how I use it so just a quick
close up don't mind my face I will show
you how to use this close up so
obviously you can flick on the on switch
button and it's gonna sound like this
and I know that sounds kind of scary but
do not fear so basically what you want
to do is you want to stretch the skin
that you're going to be using this tool
on just to get a nice clean sort of flat
area then you always want to pull the
device upwards rather than downwards so
when you're using this you really want
to swiftly move from the tool across
your face you don't want to keep it in
one space for too long because that will
cause a lot of damage to your skin so
try to always keep it moving on gradual
speed so one thing I would recommend
prior to using this tool is to
definitely thoroughly wash your skin and
make sure there's no makeup on it if
your skin does have makeup on you will
get your little disk dirty and it's not
gonna be as effective and you don't want
any makeup residue going into your pores
and then after your treatment you can go
in with any moisturizer or acne
treatments that you may have and it will
just absorb all of those treatments so
much more so yeah that is all this is
what I use to get rid of any acne scars
and I find it really useful and it does
work great if you guys want to check it
out I will have a discount code down
below that you can check out and get
some money off of this little device if
you want to purchase it and that is all
I hope you guys found this video useful
and helpful and if you guys are
interested in a little device like this

it's really really great and you get
great results for what you pay for so
that is all for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did then
definitely leave me a thumbs up it helps
me out so so much and subscribe if you
haven't already I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I'll see you
very soon in my next video bye
