how I sound Doc Martens and I'm going to
show you three different outfits and
let's get started the first outfit is of
course grungy chick when I think of
grungy fashion I often think of acid
wash jeans and Nirvana so I put those
two aspects together to create an outfit
with a leather jacket my acid wash jeans
are from River Island and especially
with classic black Doc's I really like
pairing them with very light bottoms to
kind of make them to pop and stand out
even more the Nirvana shirts from
Primark and the leather jacket is from
H&amp;amp;M so to add some ballast factor to
this outfit I added some cool black
shades my dots are just the classic 14
60s and they're in matte black I just
switched out the shoelaces to yellow
just to kind of color coordinate with my
new vanity
recently loved pairing really oversized
t-shirts with very tight fitting buttons
so here I've just got a ton of DIY share
it's a really washed out grey shirt with
the English flag on but I cut holes into
it to make it just bit tatty then over
the top I've got a thrift it'd really
oversized shirt it's almost like a
kimono on me it's got a really nice
floral pattern and is very flowy bottoms
I'm wearing some really high waist too
faux leather pants from TK Maxx and I
really like how they suit you in at
waist
as for the drawee I went with very few
rings and really really over exaggerated
two wooden panel bracelets and they've
got lovely artwork on them so I love
them very much the hairstyle that I
chose for this outfit is very quirky and
it's very out of my comfort zone but
I've been loving it recently and it's
just this half updo hairstyle and it
makes me feel very much like a princess
in this outfit I just switched back to
my black places
the last outfit is aimed more towards
the transitioning to spring although
it's getting warm it's still kind of
caught outside so in this outfit I'm
just wearing at this fuzzy jumper from
new look and some shorts that are just
carved of actual jeans if you get a
little cold just won't shorts you can
always pass and put them there and on my
head I'm just writing this really cool
floppy hat from top coat so that is all
thank you all for watching and I'll see
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
