cream contour tutorial and I'm going to
be showing you how I contour my face
with cream products and also what I use
and a little bit of info about cream
contouring so without further ado let's
just jump right into the video
first of all cream contouring is great
for a natural finish if you're going for
that natural look and you would like
your blend to look really seamless I
really recommend cream contouring the
thing about powder contour is that if
you have mature skin or if you have any
wrinkles or fine lines or your skin is
dry it tends to kind of cake up in that
section of your face if you have some
dry patches it will concentrate the
product on your dry patch and it's going
to be a nightmare to blend out or as
cream contouring just kind of glides
over that and doesn't make it look even
more dry powder products can often
settle in the wrinkles and the fine
lines of your face which kind of
exaggerates them even more rather than
making it look more flattering so
there's a common misconception that you
contour your face
you need like really high-end expensive
makeup whereas there's actually a lot of
things out there in the drugstore world
that you can use which are actually
really good for their price so the first
thing is one of the new products by
L'Oreal Paris and this is the infallible
sculpt contour kit so this is a cream to
powder product which means that when you
actually swirl it around in here it is
cream but as soon as it comes in contact
your skin and you blend it out it's like
a powder so this is really easy to work
with and you literally can't go wrong
with this product is great for beginners
and I really recommend it because of the
shade a lot of the time cultural
products can it come off white yellowy
and orange which ends up looking really
unnatural in your skin so you an opt for
something cool toned like this product
which would naturally look like shadows
carving and highlighting your face
another great product which I will be
using for this video is the Max Factor
pan sticks that one I have is in fair 25
which is the highlight shade and 14 cool
copper which is the contour shade so the
thing I love about these products is
that they're all so cool tome as you can
see that is a very cool toned Brown so
the way that I contour is really toned
down to the usual contours that you see
you on the internet I don't cover my
whole face with contour products like
highlight and bronzer I only do certain
parts and I use very very minimal
product because I always think less is
more and a little bit goes a long way so
first off I'm taking my Max Factor pan
stick this is the darker shade for my
skin so I'm just going to pop that in
the highs of my cheeks to underline my
cheekbones just on the tip of my nose to
kind of bring it up and make it look a
little bit taller I'm also going to take
it down the side of my nose just here
unto my temple down my jawline and also
behind my George's here so as you can
see I use very minimal product I don't
use loads at all and as you can see on
my forehead and my nose I work in like a
dotting motion so that it's easier to
blend out rather than having a whole
strip of product that you have to really
work in to blend so now I'm moving on to
get highlight I'm reaching for the
lighter pan stick and I think that these
products are actually just foundations
they work really well as contours I got
these from boots for about six pounds so
altogether if you buy two sticks that's
like twelve pounds which is still really
affordable for contouring products so
with this product I'm just going to
apply some above the contour just on the
highest point of my cheek I'm also going
to place some just underneath the eye to
kind of cover up my dark circles and
lift that cheekbone up higher I'm going
to place a little bit on the tip of my
nose and then also down the bridge of my
nose just a little bit on my forehead
and little dab of that product on my
Cupid's bow and also on my chin and then
to bring out my jawline I'm also going
to place a little bit of product just
here so this is what it should look like
so far so yeah that's it we're done just
kidding so of course now you want to
blend all of this out and I'm going to
be using two different brushes to blend
this out a common mistake that people do
is use just one brush to blend
everything out and I find that that's
what makes your makeup look muddy so
firstly I'm reaching for my foundation
brush and I'm going to be blending out
all of the highlight I've placed down
so now that my highlight is blended out
I'm going to be going in to the contour
part and I'm using my contour brush for
this the main thing that you want to do
is blend around the edges of your
product rather than blending the whole
thing out doing this will just make sure
that all the mapping out stays where
you've placed them but it just makes it
look more natural you just want to get
rid of all the harsh edges if you blend
directly over the whole of the product
you're just going to pick off that
product with your brush and it's just a
waste of product so what you want to do
is just blend around the edges
if you're going for that really
dramatically lifted cheek what you want
to do is as you're blending out your
contour you want to kind of swing it
along the contour of your cheek so when
I smile you can see my natural contour
of my cheek is just around here and
that's exactly where you want to kind of
blend your products in now I'm just
going to blend up my jawline you don't
want to leave that because it would look
like a five o'clock shadow by contouring
just behind your jaw you're just
creating an illusion of more defined and
sharper jaw and this also looks really
great in photographs so now for the nose
it's probably the most tricky part of
contouring for me everyone has a
different notion I feel like when your
nose is quite flat which is sort of like
mine I like to kind of contour the
bottom of my no just to create that
illusion of a more lifted nose if you
already have a slender nose and your
nose is already quite tall I wouldn't
recommend to contour your nose but if
that's something that you'd like to
experiment then by all means go ahead
and do it and not to blend the nose out
I usually use a fluffy brush like this
and this is by zoeva and this is the 2
to 8 luxe crease brush so I'm just
literally blending that out you want
this to look very natural you want to be
able to tell that there's any product on
your nose we want to really take your
time with blending this out so that is
all I hope you guys enjoyed this video
