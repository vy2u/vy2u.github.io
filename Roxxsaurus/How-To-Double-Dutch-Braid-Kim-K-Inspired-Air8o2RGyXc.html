you how to create this twin Dutch braid
hairstyle as he so many girls wearing
this hairstyle all over Instagram and
Tumblr so I thought I'm just going to
create a quick little tutorial to show
you guys how to achieve this hairstyle
on your own head of hair as it can be
quite difficult to do especially when
it's at the back of your head we can't
see anything so if you guys find this
video helpful don't forget to give it a
thumbs up and share it with the world if
any on my channel then definitely hit
that subscribe button down below i post
videos twice a week if you guys want to
follow me on any of my social media my
twitter instagram and snapchat are all
rocks auras same way about hearsay i
hope to see you guys that also before we
jump straight in I quickly wanted to
mention that I did a video on the icon
UK channel it's got loads of different
beauty views on there filming with icon
UK so it's a really fun time with a bit
of everything in there and it had so
much fun filming with that but so yeah
that's all I just wanted to kind of
mention that I did that so you guys can
check it out it's an extra video from me
but without further ado let's just jump
right into the video
so the first thing you want to do is
definitely put some product into your
hair like a serum any kind of styling
products to help smooth out your hair so
today I'm just gonna be using their
styling primer by got to be and this is
just basically if you're going to make
the whole styling process much much
easier so I'm just going to apply a
little bit of this onto the palm of my
hand
rubbing it together and then just
running it through my hand this was
really nice it smells like coconut so
now my hair is silky smooth I'm gonna
move on to the parting of my hair so for
this hairstyle it looks great with a
middle parting but you can of course
have it slightly off to the side if the
middle party doesn't see you and again
even partying I'm just using in this
little comb you can use an end of a
regular comb or you can use a makeup
brush I'm just gonna evenly separate
that up all the way to the back of my
hair
then what I'm going to do now is take my
left side and just tie it together with
a hair tie and this is just to ensure
that it doesn't accidentally get braided
into the other side but now we can just
focus on this first side so what you
want to do is take a strand of hair from
the very top of your head and you think
to thing is you just want to separate
this into three sections like stone so a
regular braid is just placing each
strand over the top of each other but a
Dutch braid is placing it underneath so
really that's the only difference so
instead of placing each strand over the
top you want to place it underneath so
I'm taking the right piece and I'm
placing this under me for in the middle
piece and I'm doing the same thing at
wherever and the other piece I'm just
placing that underneath once you've done
this one see once you add another strand
of hair from your head and add it to the
existing strand whilst you're doing this
you always want to braid this to the
back of your head not to the side and
downwards and also make sure that you
pull it really tight so now we want to
add another piece of hair to this outer
strand here so I'm just picking up some
hair and adding this and placing it
underneath of the middle strand and now
back to the right hand side so I'm just
adding another strand of hair and
placing this underneath the middle
strand I'm now back to this left piece
and I'm just going to add another strand
of hair and place this all underneath
the middle strand and this process just
continues over and over again so once he
gets it's all over the back side of your
head you still want to carry on that
taking those braids backwards but taking
a larger chunks of hair each time
once you get to the point where you
can't add any more strands of hair to
the braid you just want to continue the
braid as usual so I'm not just gonna
secure this braid with a clear hair tie
so now that you've got your braids you
can actually toggle the braid a little
bit to pull it apart and add some more
volume and if there's any loose bits
that might have not been pulled into the
braid properly you can also go back in
with a bobby pin and just pin that
together I'm also going to pull out a
little bit of hair right by my ear just
to frame the face a little bit better so
all you want to do now is just repeat
the same thing to the other side of your
hair so I'm taking a strand of hair from
the top of my head splitting it into
three sections and side to braid
underneath each strand
so now just gonna go ahead and pull this
braid apart as you can see it makes so
much difference this is what the braid
would look like without putting it apart
and this is what it looks like when you
do pull it apart and it just looks so
much more volumize and so much thicker
so that's all for my head tutorial I

you did then don't forget to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if

I want to show of you guys and that is

amazing I love you all so much and I'll
see you very soon in my next video the
dusty rose color but like I said I've
just been loving this color a lot and
it's got cute little zips on the side so
you can like put your phone in if you
want kind of feel like a witch from
American Horror Story coven wearing this
hat but that's totally okay with me I
like that it's not too low neck you know
what I mean like it's still pretty
wearable and you can just chuck anything
over the top of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
