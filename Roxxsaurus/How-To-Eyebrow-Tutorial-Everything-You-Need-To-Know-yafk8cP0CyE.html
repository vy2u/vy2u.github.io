my subscribers requested me to do an
eyebrow tutorial so I thought I might
turn this into like everything you need
to know about eyebrows and I know that
there are a lot of videos out there
about eyebrows and how to groom them and
all that jazz but I thought I'd just do
my own version things that work for me
and show you a few products and
techniques that I use to get my eyebrows
nice and neat so let's go side so the
basic thing that you need to know is
that every person has different kind of
eyebrow shapes that suit them
so to find like the right shape for you
should probably experiment with
different eyebrow shapes try drawing
them in a different way than usual and
you'll find the right shape for you
because eyebrows are very important
because they frame the face they just
give you a completely different look for
example straight eyebrows give you a
very innocent look make you look younger
so do fuller brows also thinner brows
with an more of an arch create a more
grown-up kind of vibe so you need to
kind of consider that and yes so just
play around with different eyebrow
shapes and see what works for you now
the basics for what your eyebrows should
kind of look like is you just take a
random brush for example I'm using this
random angle brush and just align it
with your nostril right there and where
you're not short ends your eyebrow
should begin and if your eyebrows are
too far apart it can really elongate
your nose and make it really wide
however if they're too too close
together they can make your nose that
really thin so just to get the right
balance just take your brush or weather
and just line it up and if it lines up
then your eyebrows are the right length
apart now if you wanted to find out
where the arch should be just to take it
here and also by the nostril it should
cross through right in the center of
your eye and that's where the arch
should be - right
at the end of that and on the other side
is the same ask for where the eyebrow
should end you'll it should just do the
same thing take your brush line it up at
the edge of your nostril and it should
cross over right at the end of your eye
and that's where your eyebrow should
also end and of course everyone gets
little tiny hairs at the end but just
get rid of them you don't need them this
is exactly how long your eyebrows should
be compared to your face I suppose so
yeah that's the first thing that you
need to know then the second is just
having the right length of your eyebrows
sometimes that they can get out of
control they can get really long so just
a quick tip you can do is use your
little spoolie brush it upwards like so
and then trim it with little tiny
scissors and this is so easy but it
definitely makes your eyebrows really
fluffy and just sometimes you get the
little eyebrows that too long and they
just hang off the edge and if you don't
know what to do with them just literally
take your spoon a brush up and cut them
a little bit just don't cut them too
much but that should kind of fix that
problem right up if you feel like your
eyebrows are too light for your face
some like sometimes if people have
really light eyebrows they don't show up
in photos and they're very hard to kind
of like and make them stand out so you
could look like you have no eyebrows to
kind of fix that problem you can just
use a henna kit for the eyebrows this
one is from boots
it's called Swiss oppa and it's kind of
like a bit tatty because I've had it for
a while now but it has two different
parts it comes with an instruction sheet
as well and you just kind of brush it on
leave it there for a few minutes and
then wash it off and you get really dark
eyebrows after that but always you keep
the solution on the darker your eyebrows
will be so you can just do that
accordingly to your hair color and
preference now for the actual filling of
the brow I use this really cheap kit
from beauty UK
it's a English brand and it's literally
it's literally very good quality I'd say
it's basically the same as any high-end
sort of eyebrow powder it's issued just
an eyeshadow so
don't pay great amounts of money for an
eye brow kind of shadow so I just got
this really cheap one it's got three
different shades which is perfect I use
the darkest one because it suits my
eyebrows the best and my eyebrows are
very dark naturally anyway and these are
just used for like an eye shadow
sometimes so it comes with many purposes
there's a little part where there's a
gel thing I think that's for your brows
to kind of stay in place but I never use
that and to apply it you can use either
this little okay what is this cool this
little brush I suppose so I use that if
I'm on the go but if I want more
precision and kind of better shaped
brows then I just use my angled brush by
Mac I know that's this whole trend of
using brow gels but I've never really
jumped on that wagon and I don't know I
just don't think that it would work for
me very well because I'm kind of very
messy with things like that so I just
get it all over the place but instead I
just use my powder stick with what I
know and over the top I use this clear
mascara it's it's for your eyes but I
just use it for my eyebrows to kind of
have everything stay in place it's by
the brand of Miss sporty so again still
kind of cheap very affordable had this
for ages and it looks kind of disgusting
but it's literally clear and what I do
is I just take it and brush it along my
kind of arch area and just the whole
brow in general very slightly and it
just keeps the brow hairs in place for
the whole day and doesn't move around or
become messy so yeah in terms of filling
in the actual eyebrow I use very little
powder because I never like my browser
King drawn on or anything like that so I
should just take my Mac brush for
example dab it a little bit then kind of
tap it off so there is an as much excess
product and I usually fill in the arch
first because that's what the place that
I need the filling most and then when
there's less powder on the brush I move
on to the kind of beginning of the brow
and then I said we're out a little bit
and then I also use the little spirity
to kind of
insert doesn't look too harsh and it's
very natural still it's you kind of get
rid of any extra hairs and get them neat
I pluck them I've never washed my
eyebrows I'm kind of scared of that
thought so all I've been doing is just
plucking it with like a little tweezer
like there's this tweeze actually came
with this beauty kit which is super
super helpful so I think that is off my
eyebrows there isn't really that much to
it I don't think I've showed you all the
products all the different techniques so
yeah I hope I helped you a little bit
maybe I'll inspire you to kind of go on
a journey of finding your eyebrow shapes
yeah that is all really so I hope you
enjoyed this video and I will see my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
