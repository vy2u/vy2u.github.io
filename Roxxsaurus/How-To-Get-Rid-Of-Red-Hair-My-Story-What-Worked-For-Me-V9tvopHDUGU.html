hair this was quite a requested video
from you guys when I mentioned doing it
so around okay so but in background I
used to have red hair as you most of you
may know it was quite dark so the
pigment was very hard to get rid of and
I know that some of you also have red
hair and just want to get rid of it foot
once and for good and it's really really
hard so I'm just going to tell you what
I did my hair isn't perfect I don't want
it to be this color but I'm gonna have
to settle with it for now and just
gradually work up to the color that I
want it to be so the process of getting
rid of my red hair kind of took me from
3 to 4 days which I know is ruined bad
because usually you're supposed to wait
like a few weeks even months before you
move on to next steps like bleaching or
hair dyeing so I kind of really sped up
the process because I didn't want to be
stuck with ginger hair so I kind of
rushed it and that's because I know that
my hair is really thick and coarse and
it can take it but for those of you who
have thinner hair
I do recommend taking the process a
little bit slower because it can really
damage your hair and make it really like
gummy when it's up to the point where
you can when it's wet and you can
stretch it that's when you know it's
really damaged so I really recommend to
kind of take take the process very slow
you guys may know I didn't actually go
to the hairdresser's to get any of this
done I did it all at home because for
one the prices at hairdressers are
really pricey and I didn't want to waste
a lot of money on going to the
hairdresser's when I can do the same
process at home and I don't really trust
hairdressers because I've had a bad
experience with one before so I just
wanted to do this at home
so I got my mum to do it instead before
you bleach your hair or juice do any
like put any chemicals on it I do
recommend to reap rep the hair before
you apply all these chemicals that are
really damaging to the hair so what I
did before
prior to dyeing or bleaching my hair or
anything like that I made sure to really
deep condition the hair for like an hour
and just keep it in your towel for a
long time just so it moisturizes the
hair
and kind of perhaps it from what's to
come moisture is the most important part
when it comes to hair dyeing because
when you bleach your hair or dye your
hair your haircut becomes really brittle
and easy to break and it's very
dehydrated so what you need to do is
just keep conditioning your hair a lot
so it regains that strength okay so
moving on to what I did I think that I
really took some really unnecessary
steps and the process was very long and
I used a lot of products on my hair so
this is just my story and what I did you
don't have to do the same thing by any
means okay so the first thing that I did
was of course strip my hair of the color
so I used a Scott Cornwall hair color
remover from boots this hair color
remover doesn't have any ammonia bleach
or peroxide so it's not that damaging on
your hair I did this process twice
because when I did it for the first time
it hardly got rid of any of my red hair
the red was still there like really
bright and I just wanted to get rid of
it so I used this stripper twice and
that kind of made my hair a little bit
less red but it was still very red so
then I realized that I really need to
bleach my hair to get rid of this color
and because I wanted to go a light brown
I kind of needed to bleach my hair
anyway because my natural hair color is
dark brown so I did that and to bleach
my hair I used a bleach by Laurie out
and it's called perfect lond maximum kit
and I also got that from boots by the
way all the products will be down below
if you want to check them out or buy
them yourself and all the products so
what I did with that was I mixed the
bleach with shampoo to kind of dilute
the bleach so it wasn't as harsh on the
hair and I also did this so the bleach
would kind of lather a bit more and it
was easier to spread the whole bleach
channel as you can tell my hair is
really long so usually hair dyes and any
like bleach kits I usually need two of
those to cover all of my hair and I
didn't want to buy like two bleaches
because I didn't think it was that
necessary so I bought one and then I'm
just mixed it with shampoo to kind of
get a little bit more of the product and
make it easier to lather and spread so
that's what I did and I also think that
because it diluted the bleach a little
bit it wasn't as
Imaging because the shampoo was kind of
moisturizing my hair at the same time
after I did that my hair was a proper
ginger color like Hayley Williams ginger
if I can I'll insert a picture of right
here I don't know if I haven't figured
out I had to do that yet but I'll try
and it was just a mess
I hated it it looked awful so then I
decided to strip my hair of the color
again thinking that it would work and it
really didn't then I decided to dye my
hair the color that I wanted and this
didn't work at all but I thought it
would but it really didn't
I used the nice and easy natural medium
ash blonde and that hardly covered any
of it I mean it did make a little bit of
a difference because the dye is a cool
ashy color so the pigments were kind of
purple which kind of canceled some of
the brassy tones in my hair but not too
much nothing major it was still proper
ginger after that I then bleached it
again and I know this is probably bad
but sometimes you really do need to
bleach your hair more than once if you
have to go up to three times of
bleaching your hair then that's kind of
bad and it is really damaging but
because I did dilute the bleach with
shampoo it wasn't that much on my hair
and I noticed that my hair wasn't
breaking off or anything so I went
through with the process after that I
did more research into why nothing was
working for my hair why my hair was
still ginger I couldn't get rid of it so
I decided to buy some toners I toned my
hair twice and I used the Scot Cornwall
color restore core hair toner and this
this banishes like brassy and rusty
copper tones from the hair and I mean
the first time I did it it did kind of
work and when my hair was still wet I
thought oh my god this is it this is
gonna work but it really didn't so I did
it again and it kind of took away the
color but it's still ginger and then to
finish that off I went in with the same
dye that I've kept using which is the
cool with it
it's the medium ash blonde by nice and
easy and I I found that it kind of
covered the ginger but it's still quite
ginger as you can tell I mean I wanted
to go sort
like brown but more on the cool side
rather than warm toned and this is not
what I wanted but I mean it's okay for
now and what I've been doing is I've
been using with silver shampoo to get
rid of any brassy tones and I find that
it works a little bit and I do see a
difference in my hair it is getting
lighter and more cool toned and the
silver shampoo that I'm using is this
one and is by provoque professional hair
care it's called touch of silver for
gray white or platinum blonde hair
you're supposed to use this twice a week
and it's supposed to brighten your hair
and actively neutralize the brassiness
Car Talk and I find that it does do kind
of it does work a little bit and I've
had that I've heard great things about
this shampoo so I will just carry on
using this and see if it does wonders to
me like it has for other people on
YouTube so I do recommend getting this
if you want to get rid of like gingery
tones quick thing I want to talk about
is the hair mask that I'm using and I
find this really moisturizing on the
hair it's very helpful and it has gotten
my hair into a good state again so it's
not like very dry or anything and the
one that I've been using is Tresemme
expert selection thermal recovery
intense repair hydration deep treatment
mask oh that was a mouthful okay so this
mask is for heat damaged hair and it
replenishes and protects it's got aloe
vera and almond oil extracts which is
super good and it's just like a plain
white mask and why do this is I use this
as a conditioner sort of thing and when
I go to wash my hair I first use the
silver shampoo and then put this on my
hair wrap it in a towel and leave it
there for like an hour and then I go to
rinse it off and why I find that it just
because it's like wrapped in a towel it
really works its magic even better and
it gives it a lot of time to really
penetrate the hair structure and really
moisturize it now you're probably
wondering why it took me so many
products to get to the place where I
sort of want to be and that's because my
hair is super coarse and super thick so
it takes a lot of product and a lot of
time to really
rid of like the hair color and because I
was using quite a dark hair color hair
dye which was the red one it was more of
a burgundy color which was even harder
to get rid of and that's why it
basically if you have any hair dresses
that you can consult then I definitely
would just to get that extra knowledge
about your hair and stuff like that just
because you don't want to damage it or
don't want to ruin it so that is all for
my story this is how I got rid of my red
hair I mean it's not perfect but it's
getting there it's going to take a while
because I mean red is such a hard color
to get rid of and I know all of your
pain but yes this is all I hope you
