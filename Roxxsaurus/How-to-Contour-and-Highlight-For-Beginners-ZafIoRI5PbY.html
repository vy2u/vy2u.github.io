highlighting and contouring tutorial and
I hope you guys enjoy so let's jump
right in so for today's contouring i'm
using this is her handy contouring kit
by revolution this is sort of similar to
anyway makeup from super drug it's one
of the most affordable brands but it's
still very good quality so today i'm
going to be using the bronzing your Shh
as this one it's like a cool toned Brown
for contouring your face I recommend
using brown shades like this that are
matte and haven't got any shimmer to it
but also cool tone because if you use a
warm toned one sometimes it can make
your face look a bit too orange and I
don't like that so I go for a cool toned
Brown like this brush I'm using to apply
this project is this little dome fluffy
brush and this is by makeup for you I
like this brush it specifically for
contouring because it fits perfectly
into any sort of them like part of your
face it fits really well into the
cheekbone and even into the nose so it's
multi-purpose so I'm just loading that
onto the brush
quite heavily to begin with and we're
going to map out where we want to
contour so the places you usually want
to contour is your cheekbone and it goes
up from your ear to the corner of your
mouth
now you can suck in your cheeks to see
the natural contour of your cheekbone as
you can see mine is just that but you
can also use a brush to sort of roll it
around on your face and you can feel it
with the brush but I'm just going to
drag that in quite heavily but don't
worry we're going to blend this out
afterwards and I like to go a little bit
higher than mattre cheekbone because
once you blend it out actually shits the
cheekbone and down a little bit so I
like to blend up rather than down
you also want to contour your temples
just on each side and that will make
your forehead look much smaller
I'm also going to ticket down my jawline
just to accentuate the angle a little
bit and I'm dragging it downwards like
this
next I'm opting for a smaller brush and
I'm using one like this which is just a
fluffy eyeshadow brush so I'm just
taking that same product and I'm
applying that to the tip of my nose just
underneath and that's going to lift the
noise a little bit and make it look a
little bit more pointy and then I'm
contouring down the side of my nose to
make it appear slimmer the nice contour
is probably the trickiest part so I
would recommend to take your time with
this every nose shape is different so
figure out how you like to contour your
nose personally I like to go a little
bit wider at the sides because my nose
is kind of thin here anyway so I like to
make it just a little bit thicker and
then I like to go thin into the tip of
my nose then I also take some of the
product that's left on my brush and I
just sweep that onto the sides of my
nostrils just again give the illusion of
a smaller and slender nose sometimes I
even go into the soft eye socket area
and I contour that bit as well and this
will again make the illusion of a slim
and then just to finish off the
contouring I'm gonna pop a tiny bit of
that same shadow just beneath my lip
that's just going to give the lip a
little bit more of a pouty look so now
that you're finished with the contouring
you can move on to the highlighting and
the highlighting is what's going to tie
the whole look together for this I tend
to use a foundation but you can use a
cream concealer or powder whichever you
like
so I'm just going to use the Max Factor
ageless elixir foundation because that
happens to be the lightest foundation
that I have at the moment so I'm just
going to pop that on the back of my hand
just like that and then we're going to
be popping that on with a brush and the
one I'm using is also by makeup for you
and it's a foundation brush so we're
going to place this underneath the eyes
in like a triangular motion just to
highlight the cheekbone but also conceal
any darkness that you may have
underneath your eye
now I know you guys may be thinking that
this is sort of toned down and it's not
really like the typical Kim Kardashian
contouring routine but I feel like for
me that's just too much makeup and I
would feel uncomfortable placing that
amount of makeup on my face so I'm just
doing a little bit more of a tone down
wearable everyday sort of version of
that yeah I just highlighted the top of
my forehead just a tiny bit of product
doesn't need to be a lot and then I'm
also going down my nose and highlighting
the tip of it and then I'm going to
highlight the jawline just to make it
pop out a little bit more and also just
a little bit on the chin so now the fun
part blending all of this artwork out
and I'm going to be using two brushes
actually for this just because I don't
want to mix the brown and the light
shades together because it just it would
just look like you covered your face
with mud so I'm going to be using two
brushes just to stop that from happening
I'm going to be using the same brush
that I did to apply the bronzer in the
first place
and of course I'm going to be using that
to actually blend out the bronzer as
well
now the key for this to look normal and
not like you've literally rolled in mud
is obviously to blend out as much as you
can and to the best of your ability
the more you blend out the more natural
is going to look but at the same time
you don't want to blend out too much so
that all you're left with is a lot of
product on your face that actually
doesn't do anything so definitely keep
in mind that you want this to look
natural but not to get rid of the
product and the mapping that you've
placed out on your face
I'm just going to quickly go into the
highlight and try to blend that out a
little bit so now that I feel like
everything is blended up pretty well I'm
going to go in with powder this step is
optional you don't have to do this but
my face tends to be quite oily and this
foundation that I applied does look a
little bit shiny too much for my liking
so I'm just going to go ahead and powder
my face a little bit with the MUA face
powder this is the lightest shade so
again it's not going to get rid of any
of the highlight that with places just
going to make it a little bit more matte
and accentuate the highlight the reason
why I also like to powder on my face
after doing this sort of highlighting
and contouring makeup is because you are
placing much more product on your face
than you usually would so you don't want
any of the product to slip and slide
throughout the day and you want it to
stay put especially because of all the
different shades that you've placed on
your face in the precise places that you
don't want it to like move down your
face or anything like that now for the
last step again it's optional but I am
personally a highlighter girl so I'm
going to be highlighting the highest
point of my face which is obviously the
cheekbone and the nose so for this I'm
going to be using this highlighter by
dior it's one of my favorite
highlighters of all time
and I'm going to be using this random no
netting brush which is like a little
fluffy angled brush
and I'm also going to take that down my
nose
and that was my finish highlighting and
contouring routine I hope you guys
enjoyed this again like I said it's a
little bit turn down than most of the
highlighting and contouring tutorial you
may see on YouTube so this is a little
bit more of a tone down routine that you
can wear for every day so that is all
for this video I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I will see my
next video bye hello everyone today I'm
going to be sharing with you my hair
care routine and that's everything from
shampooing to hair dyeing as you guys
may know this isn't my natural hair
color so I do diet a lot and you guys
always seem to ask what head isaiah's
and stuff like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
