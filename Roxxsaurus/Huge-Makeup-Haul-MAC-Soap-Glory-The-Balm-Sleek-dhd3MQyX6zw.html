collective make a pull and I hope you
guys enjoy this I'm gonna try and
whisper everything as quick as possible
because there's literally so many things
that I have to show you guys so I hope
you guys don't get too bored and let's
just jump right in
so to start off I'm gonna be talking
about soap &amp;amp; Glory and this is really
exciting for me because I have never
tried any soaking Laurie products and
they were really kind enough to send me
some products to try out so I'm just
going to show you what I got and the
first thing that I got is and there's
Hocus focus visual flow of softening
illuminator and this is literally so
gorgeous I will insert a little swatch
of this in the video somewhere around
here looking basically use this as a
highlighter and especially this will be
great for strobing but you can also
blend it in with your foundation for a
nice and glowy and dewy effect and I
just love it so much I recommend you
guys to check it out and it's also good
as a primer so it's sort of like a
three-in-one product the next thing they
send me is there's a brow artery and
this is also from soap &amp;amp; Glory and this
is basically a two and one
brow filling pencil and brush so it's
got a little twisty up brush but it's
also got a little spooley on the end and
this is in shade a blonde
she'll the next thing they sent me is
this thick and fast mascara I tried this
on my lashes today and I find that it's
really separating to the lashes and it's
also quite lengthening so I really like
that and it looks quite natural when you
put it on your lashes it doesn't clump
or anything and I also love the
packaging it's like gold like well done
soap &amp;amp; Glory well done I kept everything
in the little like packaging because
it's so adorable this next thing is the
one heck of a lot
loosen powder and it's a very mattifying
powder it's great to set your foundation
and I'll take it out the packaging to
show you what it looks like and I love
it so much it looks amazing already it
looks really white but of course it's
translucent so it's not gonna shove
white on your skin and it's got a little
sponge as well which is really handy and
the last thing is they sent me to try
out is this deep cleansing milk and this
is what is this for in one wash for all
skin types and I think this looks super
cute and I can't wait to try it out and
they also sent me a makeup remover and
this is called the total drama clean
five and one magnetising micellar makeup
remover that's a mouthful but it's like
pink so I'm really excited about that
and I can't wait to try it out and it's
also for skin types so that's good the
next week a prank I'm gonna talk about
is dub bum
so there's three first products were
actually sent to me from those dogs kill
and thank you so much das kill by the
way and the first thing they certainly
is this the new tude palette
oh it's pulling it's pulling out it
looks like this I just can't keep it in
it looks like this all the shades are
pretty nice some of them are matte some
of them are more shimmery but I really
love this dark section of the palette
here which is like matte Burgundy's and
black sand and browns or blue then I
think that's going to be great for the
fall and it's also going to make a very
sick going to look so keep an eye out
for that because I will be filming a
grunge look quite soon hopefully the
next thing they suddenly is this mr.
right now I line the pencil and this is
in shades Jack it's like this Goldy
metallic sort of color it's nice
like it the last thing they send me is
this lipgloss and it's called read my
lips in shade slap and it's just this
gorgeous pink shade and I like a lot and
then I also got some makeup from the
actual barn website and I got quite a
lot of things the first thing I received
is this Bahama Mama bronzer like the
packaging is just adorable
I've kept everything in and this is just
a really nice cool toned bronzer I'm
always looking for a cool toned bronzer
then I also got this blush called
frat-boy and the packaging is so cool
look at it I really love like the 60s
sort of ins by packaging of all of their
makeup this is an eyeshadow or blush so
it can be uses both and it's just this
really nice turn down pink which I
really like then I got two mascaras and
the first one is called cheetah and the
other one is called it what's your type
the one is actually quite thick I don't
know if you can see that but it's good
for the top lashes and I find that the
other one the what's your type mascara
is really good for your bottom lashes
because the wand is really skinny and it
looks like this then the next thing is
this liquid eyeliner and this is called
ash wing all the names and like all the
packaging really reminds me of benefit
makeup which is a good thing so this is
the eyeliner looks like this and it's
got a really pointy tip I did want a
liner with this today and I really
really like it so far it's a very good
precision eyeliner and it stays on for
quite long as well then I was also
really excited to try out some of their
lipsticks and this is in shade Amanda
kissy my lips the packaging also really
reminds me of MAC lipsticks like the
shape of it it's like a bullet sort of
shape and the lipstick itself is this
sort of red slash burgundy slash brown
color which is really amazing for the
Fall and the last two things are just
two makeup brushes the first one is
called crease love and happiness they
both have two ends which is really handy
this one has two fluffy ends which is
cool for like blending out our shadow
and this brush is called a woman
empowerment and this is more of a
precision brush this one
really sharp pencil sort of brush which
is good for detailing and the other end
is like a little angled brush strips
it's probably very good for the eyebrows
or even eyeliner so that is all for the
bum makeup sorry that was like a long
portion of this video but I just got so
many things from then what's wrong the
topic of brushes I thought I would show
you the other few brushes that I picked
up recently and I picked up this set
from Real Techniques this one is the
buffing brush then this one is a contour
brush this one is a foundation brush
which is really good for like the under
eye area because it's quite small and
this one is the what is it called
detailer brush I haven't actually used
this yet but it's a really nice flat
brush probably great for the under eye
sort of area and the other brush that
I'm really excited about is there's a
little eyeliner brush and this is from
the brand look good feel better so it's
not like a really known brand or
anything but I got this from TK Maxx but
I'm sure they might have a website so if
you guys are interested in this brush
then definitely google it moving right
along I recently purchased the Mac
velvet teddy lipstick and I'll be
wearing this like every day since I got
this pretty much it's my new baby and
it's definitely a favourites I'm wearing
on my lips right now
it looks like this it's a really nice
nudey sort of everyday kylie jenner lip
and I found that the perfect combination
with this lipstick is this gosh lip
liner and this is in shade zero zero two
antique rose and this is what the shade
looks like it's basically like the
ending of this and I really really like
this it's very like enlarging on the
lips when you over line them a little
bit you guys probably know that I love
my nude sort of lip pencils so I also
picked up this essence lip liner in 11
the nude which looks like this again
nice lip color I haven't actually tried
this with the MAC lipstick but it will
probably work quite nicely and I also
picked up this essence extra extra large
nude lip gloss which looks like this I
sometimes put this over my MAC lipstick
in velvet teddy and it just gives a nice
little gloss especially because the
lipstick is actually matte the next
thing I am so excited about you guys
probably know that I love sleep blushes
so
recently picked up this sleek blush in
rose gold nine to six and let's just say
it was love at first sight this just
look just admirer
this is such a great deep for NARS
orgasm it's that sort of rose gold e
color with little sparkles of gold in
the midst of like the pinky nurse and
I'm wearing on my cheek right now and
it's a good double for like a
highlighter and a blush at the same time
so if you're being lazy you don't want
to put on highlighter but you do want
that nice glow you can just use there
then whilst I was at Superdrug I also
picked up this revolution palette and
this is in shade Redemption these are
actually all mattes and this is such a
good dude for Naked 2 palette like they
are pretty much the same same shades I
just swatch it really quick they are
really really pigmented as you can see
really nice creamy almost buttery
shadows which I really really love these
are really nice high quality eyeshadows
for what they are they cost four pounds
for this whole palette and there's
twelve shades in theirs which is amazing
like you pay you get so much for what
you pay for this is also a really
exciting thing for me because I have
never tried to face makeup so this is my
first Too Faced product this is called
color bomb moisture plumping lip tint
and this isn't shade never enough nude
and the next thing I picked up is this
Lancome lipstick which looks like this
and this is in shade beige everyday
again the canoed sort of color you guys
probably can tell that I'm obsessed with
nude lipsticks but this is a little bit
more of a pink tone nude and it's got
quite like that purpley sort of shimmer
to it which I quite enjoy so I got that
now over the past month I think I've
been a little bit Victoria Secret crazy
the first thing I picked up is the amber
romance fragrance mist which looks like
this and I really love the smell of this
it's like a nice dusky
sort of sent I can't I can't describe
sent and then I got to Pat views by a
Victoria Secret the first one is called
new artis and this is so or just look at
the bottle just just admire it and it's
got a little like pun P free thing and
the other pepper that I got by Victoria
Secret is this one I don't know what
this is called it just says the
Victoria's Secret Victoria maybe that's
the name Victoria I don't know but this
one smells really nice as well
this smells really sweet and like fruity
citrusy kind of scent and I really like
it for summer which is sadly almost over
so that is everything I hope I whisper
this as quick as I wanted to I'm not too
sure but I hope you guys enjoyed this
and if you bought anything recently that
you guys think that I would like or
maybe you want to try it out then
definitely let me know also have a quick
question what are your favorite and
matte lipsticks because I'm really
looking to buy some new MAC lipsticks
but I don't really know what sheets to
go for I'm definitely thinking about
getting Ruby woo and cyber but I don't
know what like other popular lip shades
are really nice so if you have any
lipsticks from Mac and you swear by them
then definitely leave their name down
below so I can check them out and that
is all for today I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will see you all in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
