this dress I'm sorry but my boobs have
literally just become inverted in this
dress one wrong move and my butt cheek
will literally be sliding into someone's
DMS what is up everyone welcome back to
my channel so for today's video I
thought it'd be quite interesting to
basically go on a pretty little thing
and choose a bunch of addresses for
under five pounds
pretty little thing actually have a
whole section of dresses for under five
pounds on their website and I'm always
having a little chicken look on there
just to see what you can actually get
I'm always up for a bargain especially
if it's like a dress for going out I
really don't have a lot of going out
dresses so I thought I would buy a bunch
of them and to test them for you guys in
this video I really hope you guys enjoy
this video and find it helpful if you do
it make sure you smash that here thumbs
up just down below and don't forget to
subscribe
come and join at the dinosaur family
guys we're a hundred thousand dinosaurs
away from three million which is just
insane like I will just take a moment to
realize how crazy that is
well we hit three million I will be
doing a huge giveaway once again like I
do every single time we hit a million so
make sure you guys stick around and
subscribe for that but anyways that
without don't do a let's get on into the
video okay so I'm gonna crack into this
bag it's actually not a very big bag I
think I picked up maybe five dresses and
I'm not 100% sure I can't remember now
I'm sure you guys are like me and love
saving that dollar dollar so I will link
all of the dresses down below if you
guys do fancy any of them though which
one should we start off with I think I'm
gonna go for this one okay so this is
what it looks like it's basically just a
very simple bodycon dress but I
absolutely love the color the really
cool thing about this dress is that it's
not just a plain old bodycon dress
it actually has this cutout effect all
down the side just on one side so that
it's very cool and I mean for five
pounds to have something as cool as this
I don't think that's like a lot of hair
at all the fabric of this is actually
quite nice like it's not too cheap
feeling or anything the bando part feels
quite stretchy so if you have a bigger
bust I'm pretty sure this will fit you I
already know I'm gonna have a little bit
of
struggle with this side cut out just
because I don't have any of those like
see-through like clear underwear I am
probably gonna have my under pair own
show in this dress but let's try it on
and see how it looks okay so this is the
first address I actually really really
like this the only thing I have to say
about this dress is that the strap
cutouts on the side are positioned in a
very awkward place like I would expect
the strap to be a little bit lower like
here so that I could actually wear
underwear with this and you know
basically be able to conceal that with
one of the strap however exactly where
my underwear usually sits is where the
naked part of my skin is I absolutely
love the color and the cutout are there
I think it's really a hugging in the
body in all the right places so it's
very flattering and for five pounds I
mean like I said you can't go wrong and
I really like the fact that the cutout
is only on one side and not both because
I just feel like it would be a little
bit too much on both sides but because
it's just on one side it's like a really
nice statement but it's not too much I
really love this dress I'm gonna give a
huge thumbs up so the next dress I have
is a camo dress which looks like this
it's kind of hard to show but it's only
one like shoulder he's only got one
sleeve which is really strange I have to
say I'm not usually a fan of like one
shoulder slash one sleeve type of
clothing because I kind of feel like I
would just look really ridiculous in it
but I just thought I'd give it a shot
and I really really like the cut of this
dress it's very like body con again is
gonna be super nice tight fitting and
hugging to the body this fabric I have
to say it feels that little bit cheaper
than the previous dress I showed you
guys but I mean for five pounds like you
can't really go wrong so without further
ado let's try it on and see how it looks
okay with this dress I honestly have no
idea how I scraped this onto my body and
I don't even want to think about how I'm
gonna get it off
it is literally so tight and short and I
literally can't even move this arm this
is as far as my arm can physically go in
this dress I'm sorry but my boobs have
literally just become inverted in this
dress this dress is just a way to tie I
feel like one wrong move and my butt
cheek will literally be sliding into
someone's DMS
right it's just so tight I can't move it
I wanted to give this style another shot
but I just don't think I'm vibing with
it like it's just not my cup of tea I
think so yeah how am I actually gonna
scrape this off now I have no clue man I
need your help the next dress is a new
one that you guys know I love my nude
clothing to be honest all I ever wear is
nude white and maybe like black
sometimes so this is definitely no
surprise but I saw this dress and again
it was 5 pounds and I just fell in love
it just looked so good on the model so
basically it's like a v-neck sort of
dress then it's also like a cold
shoulder and it has like a little sleeve
which i think is really cool again when
I saw this on the website I did not
expect that this would be 5 pounds it
looks so much more expensive I feel like
they literally could get away with
charging 15 pounds for this and the
fabric is super nice it's very stretchy
and just really comfortable so I can't
wait to try this on I am a hundred
percent sure I'm gonna love this okay
you guys I knew that I would love this
dress
from the star I just love everything
about it it's definitely a tiny bit on
the sheer side like you can probably see
my underwear underneath but you can
always just wear nude underwear I love
the shape of it it's just so nice
fitting and I really like the sleeves I
feel like it's a really nice way to do
the whole cold-shoulder trended dress is
kind of versatile as well because I feel
like it would be fine for like a day
dress but also you could dress it up and
wear it out for the evening you could
100% never Tower that this is five
pounds I think she crazy it's so nice
for five pounds this dress is just so
simple and I really really love the
quality of it as well so if you've been
looking for a new dress like this I
would 100% recommend getting this one
because it's only 5 pounds and the
quality is so good the next dress I have
is hot pink literally look at my face
next to it like it's kind of radiating a
hue of hot pink on my face right now
that's how pink it is I never wear
anything like this like I never when
neon colors but when I saw this
looked kind of cool so I wanted to give
it a go and again it's only five pounds
so you can't ready to go wrong if I
don't like how I'll just send it back
does this go around my neck I'm so
confused right now
I really hope that this is a knit
because my chest is gonna be out until
you guys you guys I'm not sure if I
understand this dress Oh actually I
think you like twist it and then put
that over your head and then do that is
that how it yeah I'm pretty sure that's
how the model was wearing it okay we'll
give it a shot let's try it out okay
this dress is literally ridiculous I
honestly didn't think how this would sit
on my body and I just really don't like
unleash you're having to hold it right
in the middle because if I let go you
will be flashed and I definitely don't
want a flashy guy it's a tad too
revealing for my taste but if that's
something you guys enjoy then I wouldn't
recommend this dress I think it's really
fun for like parties but I just don't
really like the fact that it's very like
exposing in the chest area I obviously I
obviously saw it on the model but I
thought oh maybe I can make it work but
I honestly don't think I can and I just
don't think I could ever wear this dress
out but I could totally see someone wear
this dress to a party maybe and like I
be fair or something the color is so
vibrant and it's kind of really not my
taste but I really wanted to give it a
shot and see how I felt about it and I
have to say I'm giving this one a thumbs
down you guys the next dress I have to
try is a white one remember this one
actually oh yes I do remember this so
basically it's again like hey over the
next type of deal and then it goes over
your chest but then it's got like this
cutout thing so it's kind of like it
looks almost like a two-piece and then
it's also got these little wraparound
things down the sides I'm gonna have to
look on the website how to properly put
this on because I can't really remember
fabric feels a little bit like
see-through almost just a tad so I'm
hoping it's not gonna be too see-through
but the fabric is at a super super soft
and again a very stretchy so I feel like
this will be a very comfortable dress to
wear so let's try it on I'm gonna say
this one
little bit of a comic boat to be honest
I mean it definitely doesn't really look
like the pretty little thing picture it
feels kind of cheaply make now that I'm
wearing it and also it's so see-through
like I'm actually kind of glad that I'm
wearing different colored underwear so
you guys can see how see-through these
dresses are even if I wore white
underwear with this dress I just feel
like you could still see the outline of
my underwear which obviously isn't very
appealing this tie thing right here it's
just very strangely positioned like it
just keeps coming down like this and
this part the top part is so tiny and
you can actually see the underneath of
my bra now I'm not too sure if you're
meant to wear this without a bra and
kind of have like an under boob but I'm
not already into that and it wasn't
really showing that in the picture so I
assumed that this would actually fit
over my chest so it's kind of a shame
that it doesn't but I mean I probably
wouldn't recommend for you guys to buy
this one just because it is so so
see-through and it's not really one of
my favorite but yes those are just my
thoughts on this dress let me know what
you guys think down below I then have
another Beijing nude sort of dress now
this one is very simple and very plain
but there's something that I really
liked about it so this is there it's
just like a cami slash bodycon dress and
it just makes me think of like a dress
that maybe Kylie or Kim would wear it's
definitely got those Kardashian vibes
and this was only five pounds so it's
not breaking the bank button I'm
absolutely loving the shape and cut of
this dress I'm really hoping that it's
gonna give me some of those Kardashian
curves so let's whack it on and see how
it looks now this is what I'm talking
about
I absolutely I'm in love with this dress
this is definitely one of those dresses
that's super casual and simple but you
can totally dress it up with some
jewelry or like a nice jacket
so I feel like this simple like cami
bodycon dress is just right up my street
if it's super nice again I would
probably have to switch on my underwear
for a pair of nude ones I really like
the fact that this dress is super simple
but it's got this like slight edging at
the bottom I don't know if you guys can
see from this far away but it's kind of
like an overlap of the dress as the hem
I think it's like a really nice touch to
make the dress a little bit more and
nicely fitted to the body this is
definitely something that I would see
Kim K wear
it has come through and it already just
cinches you in in all the right places
so I'm loving so those are all of the
dresses I really really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and found this video
helpful because I know that sometimes a
dress shopping can be very difficult and
very expensive as well so when I saw
these really inexpensive dresses I just
needed to try them out and I'm sure some
of you guys have probably been wondering
if they're any good as well because
sometimes when you pay the price you get
what you pay for it's obviously not
gonna be like Chanel quality or anything
but I feel like with these dresses you
definitely get good value for money I
will have all of the dresses link down
below so you guys can check them out if
you liked any of them do you let me know
which one of these dresses was your
favorite if you guys enjoyed this video
