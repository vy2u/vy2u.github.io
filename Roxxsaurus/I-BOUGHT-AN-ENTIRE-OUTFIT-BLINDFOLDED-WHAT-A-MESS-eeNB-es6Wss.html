kidding me
what is that everyone and welcome back
to a channel so in today's video I
thought I would sit down and just have a
little bit of fun with you guys I
thought that for today's video I would
do kind of like a blindfolded outfit
challenge where I pretty much just go on
a website online and I buy a whole
outfit blindfolded so this way I have no
control over what the outfit is gonna
look like I literally have no clue why I
ordered I actually got you guys to
decide on Twitter where you would like
to see me do a blindfolded shop from and
you guys I knew I could trust you you
guys picked pretty little thing which I
absolutely love if you guys want to stay
more involved in my future videos like
this and do make sure you follow me on
my twitter and instagram at rock surahs
but anyways i feel like we should jump
straight to the video so I'm gonna do a
little blast from the past and literally
from yesterday so let's just jump
straight into the video okay so I've got
my nuts up here now I'm on the pretty
little thing website and the way I'm
gonna do it is I've actually got a
blindfold I'm gonna go through each of
the categories of like tops trousers
jackets all that kind of jazz and I'm
gonna get Matt to help me out so I'm
gonna pretty much just pop this
blindfold on and then just kind of
scroll randomly through the website and
then whatever item actually stopped on
that's the one that Matt's gonna put in
the basket for me so I never actually
see what I'm ordering okay so I'm flying
for who's gonna pop that on and I'm
already in the top category on the
website so I'm literally just going to
scroll all the way and I'm gonna pick
the spot up or down this one yeah
okay oh my god this is so nerve-racking
okay I'm gonna take my blindfold off and
I'm gonna go on trousers now line call
goes back on I'm on trousers now let's
do the scroll the scroll okay all right
put that in the basket oh okay so now
I'm gonna go to shoes I'm gonna select
my size already so you don't have to do
it okay so the blindfold is back horn
let's have a little scrolling scroll
okay
is that a pair am i pointing at one okay
all right put that in the basket this
alpha is so not gonna match is it it's
absolutely terrible
oh no what's next I think I'm gonna go
for maybe like a jacket or something
let's do a little scroll I'm gonna go
for that one
yes eyes a cool we're pretty lucky
actually I'm well ahead we're okay all
right showed you like a hat yeah okay I
never would have so this is gonna be
weird girls girls girls girl yeah I
think that is my turn okay yeah okay
oh there's a color choice say okay okay
I'm gonna go for this color tell me now
is there's gonna be an awful outfit okay
right
maybe not the bag shoot your back I kind
of want to do a bag blindfold back on
Roscoe squirrel that one okay so that is
everything I have chosen I'm gonna let
Matt do the ordering so I don't get to
see what's coming tomorrow and we're
gonna see it what the app that turns out
like okay so I have my pretty little
thing bags honestly my order came in
three different bags like this which I'm
just kind of like what in the world did
I actually buy why is that three bags
I'm gonna start off with the biggest bag
which is this one right
it's very poufy I have no idea what's
inside okay so what we have here are two
jackets wait is this the same thing
twice it is literally the same thing I
think Matt put it in the basket twice so
I have two of the same I don't really
ever shop for red clothing that much
especially in jackets so to see a red
jack oh wow okay I mean maybe I can make
this work I don't know I feel like red
is such a like bougie sort of color I'm
getting such like Sheryl blossom vibes
from I'm not too sure about like the
shape and the actual design of this
jacket but I have to say it is soft as
Haag so I am liking it already so yeah
this is the first item a red puffy
jacket I am so nervous to see what else
is left I'm gonna open the next bag oh
god I see more red maybe that's a good
thing okay so the first thing I see is
this this is a pair of trousers I assume
so these are like cargo trousers I have
to say I don't really ever wear cargo
trousers I have no idea if this is gonna
look okay with the jacket in my class
just a little bit or it might be the
most genius thing I've ever done right
the next item is a jumper okay so this
appears to be a very oversized like
jumper slash sweatshirt I like this a
lot by itself but I don't know how it's
gonna look with the rest of the outfit
I'm not gonna lie I am dreading putting
this off okay let's see what's next
I have a hat oh my god seriously are you
actually kidding me this is not gonna
sue at all this is just like a Baker boy
sort of hat but it's nude so it's just
kind of like all the different colors in
the wild clash together no no honey this
is not alert wow I am just I'm so
looking forward to how this is going
okay so the next item is a bag and let's
hope that my Rock Sora's dinosaur census
managed to pick a decent bag what
exactly is this I'm confused why is it
coming to why the two things so this is
the black ring detail fold-over clutch
yeah that's that but what's this is this
like a shopping bag I'm so confused
is this meant to be like together does
it come as a set I have no idea what
this is meant to be it's not really a
shopping bag maybe it's like a laptop
bag I have no clue it's a very weird
back again the very last item is a pair
of shoes so let's take a look inside a
magic kind of nervous okay have we got
okay okay
I like these I actually really like
these pop just thinking the outfit oh my
god this outfit is so bad I want to see
had some hopes that like maybe on an off
chance I could put together a somewhat
decent outfit even though I can't see
what I'm choosing but honestly no this
is just oh but this shoes are cute
though I really like the shoes okay so
that is the outfit oh my god it just
looks so bad let's put it on and see how
it like yeah I know I know you don't
have to say I look on point I mean what
can I say your girls ready for New York
Fashion Week honestly I'm just looking
at myself in the mirror right there this
is the world's ugliest outfit I have
ever seen in my whole life honestly this
just kind of looks like an Instagram
baddie gone wrong she kind of went into
a wardrobe a little bit drawing pics
have loads of random clothing items and
this V outcome I wish you guys could see
how horrible this outfit is in its
entirety but this will have
to do I mean look at them look at them
how do what you guys opinion whether you
think this outfit is the worst outfit
you have ever seen me wear or if the one
from my booboo challenge is which is
this one right here is worse because I
kind of just can't pick like I just
think that just is about living each
other yeah let me know which one you
think is worse is it this one where I
look like a little bit of a pimp or this
one I'll have a pole right there
Wow I just dab but say yeah this is the
look I mean I honestly thought I would
have a little bit better senses when it
comes to fashion I shop online all the
time I just thought I'd do a little bit
better than this I am ready to take on
fashion week so that is it for this
video I really hope you guys enjoy this
I hope you found it a little bit
entertaining just me making a fool of
myself what's new I honestly have to say
that the only two items that I actually
liked from this video are the shoes and
the jumper I'm not really too sure about
the trousers or the heart or the jacket
or everything else to be honest I'm
gonna say I have had some fun filming
this video mainly because it really got
me to buy something that I usually
wouldn't buy like that red jacket I
would a hundred percent scroll past it
and never buy it
and even though I don't really like yeah
I still feel like it's getting me out of
my comfort zone and definitely making me
try new fashion statement pieces and if
you're like me and you don't usually
like to kind of step out of your comfort
zone with fashion this is just like a
really good challenge to do even if you
end up sending everything back I really
hope you guys enjoyed this fashion
challenge if you guys want to see any
more challenges like this in the future
