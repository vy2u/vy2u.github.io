not what I bought what's up guys how's
it going so today I have a very exciting
video because I'm gonna be testing out
some fake designer items off of ebay I
have seen so many fake designer items on
eBay and I sometimes just wonder is this
even allowed like it's obviously so
illegal to be selling fakes off of like
really expensive brands but there was a
part of me that was kind of curious
about it we see I'm not here trying to
promote buying fake designer items
that's not what I'm about all I want to
do is just try out these products for
this video and let you guys know the
down low if I think that they look
anything like the pictures on eBay and
if they resemble anything of the actual
original product so I ordered quite a
lot of stuff now I haven't even opened
any of these yet because I really want
to show you guys my genuine of first
impression and reaction before we jump
straight into this video I have a very
quick announcement to make that is that
I have launched my own home where store
now it's not completely done yet and it
still got a couple of months yet to
launch properly but I have made an
Instagram page for it already and I'm
really excited to share it with you guys
so make sure you guys go follow it to
support it and also see the updates of
the progress and the products and those
sneak peeks of what we're gonna be
selling on our store it's definitely
gonna be a lot of affordable home web
pieces that you guys are gonna love
which I'm so excited for make sure you
guys follow my home West store Instagram
page it's called our ex home I'll have
it right here on screen as well as in
the description it would really help me
out so much if you went and followed but
anyways if you guys want to see what
fake designer items I picked up off of
ebay then a les canard into the video
okay so the first item I have is this
one right here now I can feel that this
is a handbag but let's crack this bad
boy open and have a little dirt
it smells like rubber soles of a shoe
really words but this is the Gucci B
handbag the original photo looks like
this the original of this handbag
literally retails for like a thousand
pounds maybe even over that so it's a
lot of money this is actually pretty
good okay look at this I've only paid 14
pounds 85 for this so I would say that
for that kind of price it actually feels
really nice this feels like faux suede
and then this feels like kind of like
faux leather a little bit it's got like
the whole snake thing on the actual
buckle and it's got the B I mean looking
at the picture of the beyond the
original bag it is very different the
stitching and the coloring of the B is a
lot different on the original bag but I
mean come and like for a first sort of
look it actually doesn't look too bad
I'm actually pretty impressed let's open
it up so it's got the chain inside which
actually feels quite nice so and this is
the chain the chain is actually made out
of metal not plastic which is really
really good and it seems quite sturdy
now let's open it up and have a look
inside so it's got this like faux suede
panel and it's also got the faux suede
on the side right here but inside it
actually looks quite spacious I feel
like I could fit quite a bit in that I'm
not too sure if the original bag is
lined inside with any sort of Gucci
fabric but this one unfortunately isn't
I mean I don't really expect it to 415
pounds overall it's got a very similar
feel to Gucci and it's got the pattern
all over it actually looks quite legit
to be honest like unless you're looking
really up close it really does look
legit I think overall the shape of the
handbag is exactly spot-on
it literally resembles the real one so
much the only differences are of course
the buckle the buckle has little gems on
it whereas the original one doesn't and
obviously the beat is slightly different
but I mean I'm not gonna cry about that
because this was only 15 pounds overall
I feel like we're off to a pretty good
start I mean would you guys think about
this bag I'm gonna give that bag like
his 7 out of 10 just because I feel like
it's actually a pretty good replica ok
so let's move on to it the next item now
I can feel from the bag that this is
probably the Louie Vuitton wallet let's
crack it open and see what it looks like
I actually have quite high hopes for
this one ok here we go so it's kind of
wrapped in like this paper thing this is
what it looks like hey oh my god this is
such a scam this is not what I bought
now first things first I'm going to tell
you guys what the picture actually
looked like on the eBay listing so here
it is this is the picture now does it
look like this no I don't think so
of course I didn't expect the real thing
but I kind of expected it to look
more like the original then what this
looks like it's just not enough of the
little logos on there like they're
really really big whereas in the picture
it looked like they were all very small
and it looked actually quite legit so
I'm kind of disappointed I mean this
cost me like 10 pounds so I do feel like
they've scammed me a little bit because
they miss sold the product to me like I
said I'm not expecting the real thing
obviously for like 10 pounds that's not
gonna happen but I definitely expected a
lot better than this but either ways the
quality is quite nice it feels like
quite nice faux leather then it's got
two of golda's it first
now inside at the wallet there's like a
little handle strap that you can
probably attach to the wallet inside it
kind of feels a little bit cheap like
the little dividers that she made of
like this plastic key sort of material
the other compartment is literally
broken like this zipper just won't even
move that is so disappointing how could
you sell this this is exactly why I did
this video because I really wanted to
find out whether the things that they
are advertising Nettie Bay listings
actually look anything like what they're
gonna send me or if they look anything
like the original product I'm gonna give
this product like a 2 out of 10 because
although it's still like quite nice on
the outside I feel like it's broken
like the compartments are broken and it
doesn't really look like the picture
that they posted on their actual eBay
listing so I would say that's kind of
unreliable of them and it's sort of like
a scam cuz they mislead me to buy this
product so 3 out of 10 let me hurry
right along I have another parcel right
here now this is obviously a pair of
shoes I can tell by the box okay so it
comes in the little box like this so
they come in like to dust bags so these
are the balanced yoga knockoff shoes
they actually look pretty legit I mean
I'm gonna compare it to the photo
because I can't exactly remember how the
valancy hago shoes look okay so looking
at the picture of the balanced yoga
shoes which is right here this is the
original product I feel like these are
kind of along the same lines but really
not so much they're obviously the
similarities they have is and the strap
going across the toes and the little
black skirting all across the back now
if I remember correctly the real
balanced yoga trainers have like suede
all across the back and across
this little bit here so this is
definitely a big difference because this
is just all one material that work on
the toes of the trainers are kind of
like a running shoe fabric now I don't
think that that's what the balance our
shoes are like from the picture and it
also seems that they don't actually have
any shoelaces whereas these shoes do now
correct me if I'm wrong I don't own a
pair of balancer shoes but from the
picture it looks like they don't have
shoelaces they look quite comfy I
probably would use these for the gym but
not really as like a fashion statement
I'm probably gonna give these like a six
out of ten because although they do look
quite nice I just don't think that
they're that close to the original
product now this item right here is
basically the Gucci table that you guys
have been seeing all over Instagram so I
thought I would order myself line off of
ebay because I'm not gonna pay the full
amount definitely not so let's have a
look or what this looks like
I haven't looked at the top properly yet
you guys are gonna see it first so let
me know what it looks like
does it look legit does it look anything
like the real thing okay the grand
reveal ah oh my god wha
in the availa sting it did not say
guilty
it said Gucci so what is that then now
correct me if I'm wrong I've never been
this close to a Gucci top but I don't
think that the letters are meant to be
glittery although this top was a little
bit of a click bail on eBay's behalf I
do feel like it's still pretty nice
quality and I definitely could wear this
I'm gonna give this like a 5 out of 10
because it's not actually too bad of a
top but obviously I was quite misled by
eBay yeah together this next item I'm
really excited for because it from what
I can feel and from what I can remember
that I ordered I'm pretty sure that this
is the Louis backpack okay let's crack
this open guys I can't open this now
this is the thing with this item so I'm
actually not too sure if Louie Vuitton
actually produce this a full size
backpack like the one I just purchased
off of ebay so it might just be like a
completely new design just inspired by
Louie Vuitton I know that Louie Vuitton
does the mini backpacks which look like
this but I've never actually seen like a
full size backpack so this is gonna be
quite interesting are you kidding
this is not what I ordered again it's
really like wide and out of shape I feel
like I need to like put it back into
shape somehow okay so it's signed to
kind of look like a real backpack now I
mean it's still kind of wide but I just
feel like it's these little sides here
that need to be pushed in as it's been
so flattened in the post so my first
impression is that this is quite a nice
backpack it looks really well-made all
of the hardware is gold which looks
really really nice it definitely
complements the backpack really well and
like the faux leather straps feel quite
nice quality as well but the one thing I
do have to say is that this is
definitely not what I ordered this is
the picture that I ordered off of the
eBay listing and I just feel like they
look nothing alike
okay now let's take a look inside so
this is the first compartment which is
very very thin I guess it's more for
like little bits and bobs and then you
have like a bottom compartment which
open real it actually doesn't open it's
just a zipper
what the heck saris the main cause hot I
gotta be real luckily it is this is just
what it looks like inside it's got like
a little compartment inside overall I
just feel like this backpack is very
miss shape but I'm gonna give this like
a 4 out of 10 it was only 13 pounds so I
can't really expect amazing things from
it but it's definitely really cool to
see what you can actually get for your
money's worth the next product is
another pair of shoes and now this is
the replica of the fenty creepers this
is what they look like they actually
look pretty nice I ordered these for 949
so that's a really like affordable price
for shoes the first weight of the shoe
is actually really nice quality and also
the sole feels quite sturdy and now
let's compare it to the original product
so here is the photo of the real fancy
shoes and do you guys think this looks
anything like it I definitely think the
sole is way more orange than the
original but apart from that like the
color on the actual shoe is very close
to the original the only thing I would
say is different on the top half of the
shoe is that it hasn't got the same
stitching as the fenty shoes but that's
not too big of a deal I feel like issues
are actually a pretty good dupe because
if you don't have the money to splurge
on the real friend
shoes and you wanted to get that same
sort of effect you could totally pick
these out well though these aren't
exactly the same as the Fanta shoes I do
still really really like them I think
they're really cool-looking so I'm gonna
give them like a 9 out of 10 so the next
item is a pair of sunglasses to switch
it up a little bit so this is actually
meant to be a replica of the Saleen
sunglasses I'm not too sure what they're
called exactly but they're like the
cat's eye sunglasses I'm really excited
to see if these are gonna look anything
like the real thing
obviously they look a lot different in
the picture and I think it might be the
angle that they were taking in but this
definitely doesn't look like Selene I
mean they look kind of cool on they
don't look too bad these honestly feel
like they're gonna break in like 0.2
seconds beautiful only 199 so I can't
really complain they definitely look
like a lot of design to sunglasses out
there they still look quite cool but
they don't look anything like the Selene
sunglasses and they are really really
cheaply made but at the same time you
can't really expect too much for 199 now
the last item is another Gucci handbag
so this is a knockoff of one of the
famous like Gucci handbags I'll insert a
picture right here this is the original
handbag so I paid it 1099 for this which
is quite a bargain considering the
original bag it's probably like
thousands of pounds oh my god this is
actually really similar to the picture
look at that so this is the Gucci
handbag that I got from eBay and this is
the original pretty impressive actually
oh my god it's got the same strap as
well do you know I'm actually really
impressed like really really impressed I
didn't think that this handbag would
look so close to the original okay so
the strap is on I'm actually super super
impressed granted it does feel a little
bit cheap but it definitely looks really
really close to the original fire you
would not be able to tell that this is
not the legit thing and obviously what
these brands are all going for so I mean
the closer you look to the original with
the better this is what it looks like
inside it's got a zipper compartment and
also a little compartment in here I'm
gonna have to give this handbag a 10 out
of 10 because I honestly feel like it's
my favorite product that I've tried so
far it really looks so similar to the
picture on the eBay listing as well as
the original product so I'm definitely
giving it a big thumbs up
let me know what you guys thought of all
the products and which one was your
favorite I think this video was so
interesting to fill because I feel like
I got to see what you can get for your
money's worth on eBay and I definitely
fulfilled my curiosity on all the fake
designer stuff on eBay if you guys have
