channels so in today's video i thought i
would do a abu who clothing haul however
there is a twist
instead of always doing like serious
clothing hauls and things that i
actually like I thought I would do a
sales haul I thought this would be a lot
more funnier and kind of a challenge if
I didn't actually get to decide what I
bought but I had to select the first
item that showed up and was the cheapest
for each category such as trousers at
tops and shoes this then generated a
whole outfit which I literally had no
input over and I am actually gonna have
to wear this outfit out so let's hope
that it will look okay if you guys enjoy
this video and have never seen my face
before do make sure you subscribe and
come and join and the dinosaur family
and also don't forget to click the bell
button down below to stay notified of
every time I post a new video but
without further ado let's get on into
the video so the very first thing that I
did is I went on the boo hoo website and
I basically went into the top sales
section I picked my size and then the
first item that came up was this and I
was literally forced to buy it even
though it was her so this top cost me
literally only two pounds now I have to
say I like the color it's kind of
matching my jacket right now I love
mustard so you guys might think it's not
that bad but trust me it is so awful
like I just don't understand it this is
what it looks like it's like nice it's a
crop top it's got like a high neck which
is totally cool but then it's called
like this black tie front which kind of
looks like a bikini that's been put over
a top which I really really do not dig
but that's the top so I mean I guess for
two pounds it's not too bad but I just
hate the fact that it's got this like
tie front I just think it's the weirdest
top I've ever seen so that's that for
the top now let's move on to the
trousers these trousers were again
another god or four items on the website
which I'm not surprised about like all
of these selves items are clearly things
that people don't want to buy so they
kind of just like want to get rid of
them a little bit these trousers cost
four pounds so this is what they look
like they're actually not that bad at
the top like you guys are probably
thinking what is she on about
not bad at all which I can kind of agree
with they're not bad until you see the
bottom I can't it literally looks like a
fishing net like I'm sorry
like who designed this first of all then
ventured over to the jacket sale section
and I actually picked up a blazer which
is this this was five pounds and it's
such a pretty nude color but it is a
blazer so I'm kind of like already
thinking that this is not gonna match at
all and I really don't want to have to
wear this outfit out like honestly it's
just gonna be so embarrassing so this is
the place I know I have to say it
actually doesn't look bad at all like I
would a hundred percent buy this and
wear it but just with a different item
of clothing like I probably wouldn't
wear it with this sort of outfit I think
it's so cute this was only five pounds
and I mean there's honestly nothing
wrong with it
as they're like an item alone so once my
top my blazer and also my trousers were
all bought I then obviously had to head
over to the shoe section I obviously
selected the sell part and I basically
bought these bad boys now these are
actually not that bad at all by
themselves but they just literally are
the nail to the coffin of this whole
outfit they literally just like top it
off and if you can tell I'm being
sarcastic because they literally don't
go with this outfit whatsoever they're
just gonna like look so bad but I love
them like I actually really really like
them by themselves I would totally wear
them just not with this outfit like so
once I had at my whole outfit picked out
which I was already like this is god
damn awful I do not want to wet this out
I left thought I'd be interesting to
head over to the accessories section to
see what we could get and basically I
then went into the sales section of
accessories and the last item you guys
are good a howl at this because it's
just so oh why did I have to buy this
basically the first item that came up in
the accessory section was this now if
you couldn't tell what this is it's very
jiggly it's Christmas related
and it's some nipple tassels these are
tinsel nipple covers that cost me how
much were these this was literally a
pound but I had to buy it because it was
the first thing in the accessories
section so I'm just gonna be jingling
away whilst I go out in this outfit so
that's just great so this is the outfit
I am honestly just like dreading going
out in this because I basically have to
go out and do some food shopping for
dinner and I thought it'd be quite funny
to wear it in like my local big Tesco
and just make a fool of myself basic
okay this is the outfit what do you guys
think
hey hey you look very very interesting I
feel like this whole outfit looked a lot
better in my mind like in my mind when I
was buying this I was like it's not
gonna look that bad like yeah it's ugly
it's a little bit ugly but it's fine
like I'm not gonna be that ashamed to
walk out in it I was wrong I was
dreading like literally dreading walking
out in this like especially in my local
town like I live in quite a small town
where people do not ever dress anything
like this
so yeah wish me luck obviously and I
have got mine little nipple tassels
under here which I'm sure you guys can
see then a very pointy I'm really sorry
too this rap thing for hating it so much
because now it's kind of serving me a
purpose like it's making me a little bit
less embarrassed but you can still see
my jingles under that I worry and you
really don't want to go out in this like
it just looks ridiculous everything
about this outfit especially the
trousers why did I do that it's that why
am I doing this
anyways I feel like we should go get
Matt's reaction okay what do you think
of my outfit oh that's quite it do you
like the color scheme it's like a title
in right I hate it what does your tour
so basically
like nipple covers because basically I
had to choose yeah I had to choose the
first thing that came up on the
accessories page and I didn't get a
choice so I had to get like gingerly but
jingling nipple covers I know so yeah oh
you expect to wear this out with me
wearing it Oh run that word out but you
have to come out with me but I drop you
off somewhere
Oh what do you think of these but with
like fish knit tee then this is such a
weight outfit I hope you're somewhere
I don't mind me I'm just doing some
shopping and not gonna just outfit I
actually can't believe I'm actually like
out in this outfit it's so awful and
everyone's like look there's an actual
doubt many people in this aisle but
around to scope everyone was like
properly judging me especially because
when I walk I'm actually embarrassed and
you were embarrassed for me as a lot
nude yeah yeah no I'm very good choice
about it and also like this is so the
cement weak robber it's like poop of
sticking out so I keep having to like
tuck it in
oh my god that was literally so
embarrassing I hated every second every
time I moved with outfit on my little
like jingling nipple covers would
literally be playing jingle bells it was
honestly a mess whilst I was purchasing
these items it was so much fun to
basically see what the website had
destined to me to where I would love for
this video to become like a challenge
because I feel like it's so much fun and
it's honestly hilarious having to go out
in such a mismatched outfit if you guys
enjoy this I would love to do another
video like this with maybe like
misguided or pretty little thing do let
me know down below which of these items
you think was the most awful I honestly
feel like the top or was the ugliest
item of the whole lot like the shoes and
the Blazer were okay like I would have
worn them by themselves just not with
that outfit but that's hot
but that is all for this video I really
hope you guys found this video
entertaining and fun to watch it do give
this video a thumbs up if you guys
enjoyed it it will help me out a lot but
yes there's a little thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
