these jeans I want to know what's up
everyone welcome back to my channel so
for today's video I'm gonna do kind of
like a comedy type of hole I don't know
about you guys but I'm always on like
pretty little thing a sauce whoo-hoo all
those kinds of online websites and
sometimes when you're scrolling through
all of the clothing and the new end you
kind of come across so many weird
clothing items and sometimes I just sit
to myself and think who actually buys
those so for today's video that person's
gonna be me I basically went on ASOS and
I pretty much picked the weirdest items
of clothing that I could find on the
whole website these items were kind of
difficult to find I literally spent like
hours and hours and hours to try and
find these but I feel like I found quite
a few items which I'm just really
nervous to try to be honest if you guys
enjoy it this video do make sure you
smash that huge thumbs up it just down
below and also if you're brand new or
don't forget to subscribe it come &amp;amp; join
it the dinosaur family and also YouTube
at the moment is being really really
annoying so please make sure you hit the
bell barn as well just to stay notified
of every time I post a new video cuz I
know that a lot of you guys that don't
actually get my videos through to your
subscription boxes if you do want to see
my videos your best bet is to definitely
hit that bow back
but anyway so without further ado and
let's get on into the video okay so
first things first I just want to
mention that a sauce has come through
they literally sent me a sample of tiny
little Kit Kats with nuts inside and I
am just blessed by this thank you a
sauce thank you this is exactly what I
need but anyways let's jump straight
into the actual cloves and the first
item is probably one of the weirdest
dresses I have ever seen in the packet
it doesn't look that bad but let me just
open it for you hi and so as soon as I
saw this on the website I was like I
need to get this and try it because it's
just one of those things that I would
never ever think of purchasing this is
the dress oh my god is so weird like why
why would someone design this this
literally looks like a massive
tassel this is actually by a
oh so it's not even by like an external
brand this is their own piece of
clothing which they have thought there's
going to be a good one you know like
yeah I just I'm not sure where they were
going with that
this is the sleeve it's kind of like
sheer which is kind of cool but it's
just these tassels it's just it's doing
its absolute most this dress so yeah
let's uh go put it on and see how it
looks okay so the dress it looks so
weird there's so many tassels it's just
a really busy dress like I actually
really like the color of it but it's
just everything else is so much like you
should look how long it is it goes all
the way down to the floor if it was like
that sure then maybe I can make it work
like the tassels okay I get it it's like
meant to be a tassel you dress but then
like all the lace and the Sheerness spot
with a saying that this is kind of fun
how would I to wear this just so I can
do this
so the tassels definitely serve some
kind of purpose but it's just not
running my taste like you should look
how long it is it goes all the way down
to the floor if it was like that sure
then maybe I can make it work I'm
actually interested do let me know if
you guys think that this dress is pretty
and would you worry that's the beauty of
fashion though it's subjective and I
feel like even though I think it's
hideous some of you guys out there might
think is actually quite cool but I just
I'd be quite funny to you know buy some
weird things like this just to try
because this is definitely something I
would never ever think about buying or
wearing outside so it's definitely not
my cup of tea this is going straight
back to a thought I'm sorry okay so the
next piece of clothing is this right
here so this is kind of like a jumper
thing or maybe like a sweatshirt from
what I remember the reason why I picked
this up is because it literally looked
so strange to me I have never seen
anything like it
whilst it out to me is the fact that
it's just like a plain jumper as you can
see but just wait for it this jumper is
literally business in the back and party
in the front but it's got kind of like
this weird foamy 3d like massive ruffle
across the front and I just thought who
would actually buy this it's just so
strange this is from a brand could lost
ink which I've never heard of before
actually but let's try it on let's see
how it looks I have to say when I was
putting this on it really doesn't look
like you would feel like kind of like
swimsuit fabric but it really does the
fabric is so thin but I guess I had to
make it a little bit more thicker
because obviously and this is kind of
like 3d so if it was too flimsy a wooden
briefs and are honestly is so hard this
room right now like the lights are
getting so hot I'm literally sweating
but yeah this is what it looks like it's
just such a weird jumper I have never
seen anything like this before I think
it's so interesting I have no idea where
I would wear this or if this is even
socially acceptable it's kind of like to
get into my face here but I don't know
let me know what you guys think below
okay now for the next product I have
these jeans and now these aren't just
regular jeans because that's not the
point of this video so this is what they
look like they kind of have like a
cutout belt buckle situation going on in
the front
in the photo online I actually thought
that this would be kind of like this all
the way through to the back of the leg
but it's actually not is covered all the
way at the back which makes the Jean
look just a little bit more no war but
the party happens in the front where you
have these little like strap buckles
which you can adjust yeah I honestly
don't really know the point of these
jeans why they're like this but I guess
it's kind of cool but yeah again I've
never seen anything like this so I just
really wanted to try it and see if I can
pull it off sorry these other jeans and
now I have to say now that I'm wearing
them and I know that this part of my leg
is covered and not cut out as well in
the back they actually don't seem that
weird anymore I mean don't get me wrong
they're still a little bit out there and
maybe if I was feeling a little bit more
comfort in one day I could potentially
wear these I gotta say this is probably
gonna be one of the most amount I Tamar
the whole haul today so yeah now that
I've got them on I just don't think
they're as weird as I thought it would
be now for the next item I have a pair
of shoes which is actually from a
misguided these shoes are honestly the
weirdest
pair of shoes I have ever seen I guess
the whole clear shoe has been kind of
around for a little while especially
when Kim Kardashian and celebrities like
that have been wearing them but these
are just so weird they don't look like
they'll be comfortable at all but I mean
can we just talk about how sweaty your
feet would get in these oh I've actually
really not looking forward to trying
these on but I guess they are kind of
cool they're a little bit different
they're boots well actually they do have
little holes in the side of the shoe
just to kind of let your foot breathe I
guess but still I just don't think these
tiny holes are gonna keep your foot
ventilated in this like plastic okay so
these are what the shoes look like on I
have to say the skin on my foot right
now looks so funny just because the way
the plastic kind of grinds against the
skin it makes it like wrinkle which just
looks so unappealing like I said it has
got the little holes on the side where
you can you know let your foot breathe a
little bit but I just have no clue how
this would wear if I was like you know
wearing it for a couple of hours I fir
would probably be covered in sweat
surprisingly these are actually not as
uncomfortable to walk in standing as I
thought they would be because the heel
isn't really that high but in general I
can just tell that these shoes are not
gonna be the most comfortable shoe I own
so these are definitely going straight
now now the next weirdest item of
clothing that I have bought from a sauce
is another pair of jeans but let me just
tell you these are not a normal pair of
jeans the jeans are literally on another
level I don't think you guys are ready
to see these jeans so this is at the top
as you can tell you're getting like
high-waisted vibes as you're getting a
lower lower you're kind of gonna start
seeing the jeans get wider and wider but
let me just remind you that these are a
size 8 so then we have so much fabric
woah why why is this literally so wide
who designed these jeans I want to know
no wonder how much money they spend on
all this excess fabric like that must
have cost a lot to make this oh yeah
these are the jeans I list you can't
even fit them in my viewfinder so yeah
these are definitely
interesting pair of jeans so let's try
the mug and see how they put these are
an absolute joke what actually is
honestly don't know who would buy these
but whoever does I actually applaud you
because I just feel so ridiculous I feel
like I could actually take on like a
circus or something oh yeah I would
definitely get a pass on these ones but
these are by far the weirdest trousers I
have ever tried okay so the next item I
have here is a little like kimono or
just a coat I guess but it is very very
sparkly is so flashy and I honestly
don't really know if I hate it or if I
like it maybe I would like this a lot
more if it was a different color but the
orange is just too much for me I think
this is what it looks like from the back
it is literally so shiny I could totally
take on Vegas movies it is very noisy as
you can hear these sequins are so huge
that they literally kind of feel like
you've got a handful of like tokens at
the arcade so yes when I saw this I just
needed to get it and try it and see how
it feels in person because I always see
like sequin clothing online and I'm just
always like oh I don't know if that's
gonna like be nice to wear so let's put
it to the test let's try it on and see
how it feels well isn't this oh look I
kind of hate today at the beginning but
now that I'm looking at it it is so
fabulous you guys are probably screaming
at me right now you were like no that is
not fabulous Roxy it's definitely an
interesting item of clothing it's
definitely not something I would ever
look to buy or wear now that I've got it
on it's kind of fun like I don't want to
be a hater in this video so I'm kind of
like I'm kind of diggin air which is the
ironic part I love the shape of it it's
kind of just like a kimono kind of style
and it is just covered in sequins
quality could definitely be a little bit
better but at the same time it is
covered in plastic so what can you
relate this back
I like it I don't know maybe for the
festival or something or just like a
dress-up party this would be cool
definitely not for everyday and it's
very noisy listen to this very last item
of clothing that I'm going to be testing
out today is this dress so this is again
a really strange dress that I have never
seen anything like it before it's
basically like a front panel dress the
side is like a nude sheer and then this
is the back so it's completely strapless
this is just kind of gonna be like this
on my chest and then the sides are just
gonna be purely exposed it doesn't go
that low down but it definitely goes
past your knee and it's got a little
slit in the side the fabric actually
feels really nice and again this is from
ASOS own so they are coming out with
some really weird things recently but
this just looked really interesting to
me so I thought I'd give it a go so
let's try it out okay so this is the
dress I don't mind my underwear I
realized that they are showing I don't
mean to flash you guys but this dress is
far weird so basically you've got this
side panel here that's completely made
out of mesh and my sticky bra is
actually hanging out of this pot here
because this white thing isn't even wide
enough to cover my boobs so I do wonder
who would actually wear this if you
can't really cover yourself up very well
you know this dress has literally no
support whatsoever so it's not like you
could just rock out with no bra on
that's why I'm wearing my little sticky
bra and even then you can like see it on
the side so I don't know how you would
wear this but with that being said I do
really like the shape I think it looks
very sleek and it's just a little bit
different from other dresses that's why
I picked it up I've never seen anything
that was made like this with this front
panel and this is actually supported by
like wires on either side so the top
half isn't really like fitted very flat
to my skin if that makes sense but yeah
this is by far the weirdest dress I
could find on the website I like the
idea of it I kind of see where they were
going but maybe it could just be made a
tiny bit better
so those are all of the bits that I have
picked up for this video
these were honestly the weirdest items
of clothing I have ever
on a sauce or even on any website in
general if you guys did enjoy this video
