welcome if you are brand new hi I'm Roxy
so today's video I am so blooming it
excited to film because I have seen
these videos kind of all over the
internet lately and I really just wanted
to give this a go for myself and that is
copying a celebrity's Instagram for a
week now as you can see from the title
I'm gonna be copying gigi hadid
Instagram and I'm really excited because
I've met quite a few times she is
literally the nicest person ever and she
is so beautiful so this video is just a
little bit of fun to see if I can make
my photos look like Gigi Hadid now I've
had a little bit of help with this video
from my boyfriend Matt so you guys
should definitely go check out his
Instagram take some really cool photo so
I'll leave it down in the description so
you guys should definitely go follow him
if you guys enjoyed this video make sure
you smash that huge thumbs up down below
come and join the dinosaur family by
subscribing and also don't forget to
click the notification Bell button down
below to stay notified of every time I
post a new video well that for ado let's
get on into the video okay guys so this
is outfit number one and oh my god of
the makeup I actually love it it's
definitely different to what I usually
would wear and I did genuinely use the
same palette that Gigi used this is her
ggx Maybelline palette and I've also got
the same brush that she used in the
photo so I'm really excited to recreate
this the only thing I don't have is the
same background as her so I'm gonna try
and make do and maybe Photoshop
something to make it look more like a
studio slash warehouse and also I don't
have a white clip sorry let's just have
to use this like stationary clip and
it's black so it's not quite the same
but we're just going to work with
okay guys so we've just finished taking
the photos and I'm just looking through
some of them now and they look pretty
good I mean look at that Matt's done a
really good job but making them really
close to the original image now just a
quick disclaimer I basically flipped all
of Judy's photos because when I met her
she told me that her good side is her
left side worse for me my good side is
my right side
so basically we always take photos from
opposite sides that also our partings on
the different side so basically I
flipped her photo so that I couldn't
replicate the exact same photo as her
and then I'll be flipping both of them
back if that makes any sense so let's go
back to my room and take a look at the
final photo so this is the final photo
here's the comparison of mine and Gigi's
photo I honestly feel like it looks
pretty close I mean it obviously is a
little bit of difference we don't look
exactly the same but as for like the
position the makeup I feel like
everything is actually pretty close I
think I'm gonna give myself a pat on the
back for that one I mean the lighting is
kind of similar I had to really heavily
edit the colors of this photo and also I
edited in the background because
obviously my background was just a plain
white ceiling but basically I just took
on the background from GG's photo and
just placed it into my photo on
Photoshop and I feel like it actually
ended up looking pretty close I even
took her little clip because like I said
I didn't have a clip that was white I
only had a black one so you know if
you've got those Photoshop skills you
might as well make use of them so I
actually posted this photo on my
Instagram and loads of you guys that
freaked out everyone basically just knew
that I was copying gigi hadid Instagram
you guys were on it like a car Bonner so
here are some of the comments from you
guys that you guys are honestly the best
I love my Instagram fam if you guys
don't follow me on Instagram you totally
should it's just at rock surahs so let's
go hang out over there this photo at the
moment has 28,000 likes in six hours
which is actually pretty good for my
instagrams also got 412 comments I don't
usually get this amount of comment in
the first few hours that I upload so I
feel like this photos and now the tick's
have done really well okay so that was
photo number one now let's move on to
photo number two so moving on to the
next photo this is the photo I'm going
to be replicating so basically I try to
find as close of a top to this as I
could but I really couldn't find
anything as similar to this because
obviously it's got like some stripes on
the bottom and then another top is just
plain white so this is the only thing I
could find really and I mean I think
it's pretty close then I just have a
leather jacket from a sauce now this is
what it looks like it is a little
bit different to what Gigi is wearing
and then to finish it off I have my
Baker boy hat I don't know if that's the
actual like name for this hat I think it
should look pretty similar to her look
I've got my hair in a ponytail too so
we're gonna see if I can replicate this
photo I feel like it might be a little
bit difficult but we're gonna get there
guys sorry this next photo we're gonna
take outside in the god and also just
before we go look at this I've already
managed to get foundation on my top
which is thrown away I'm gonna have to
edit that out so this photo is very
blurry so I feel like this kind of
garden sort of setting will be perfect
for I'm also gonna use a little bit of
the lower fence to act as like the gray
in this photo because obviously this was
taken on like a street but we're gonna
try and kind of replicate that in our
garden okay so we have finished taking
the photo and this is kind of what it
looks like I even managed to get that
wind in there that looks really cool but
it's freezing so let's go back inside
so this is the second photo I am
actually obsessed with how this turned
out I really really like it no like I
was able to get a pretty close like
composition to the photo and I'm
actually really impressed with Matt's
photography skills cuz he managed to
make this photo look so good literally
it was taken to my garden but it looks
like it was taken on some kind of like
New York's tree or something I added all
the VOC tags it's not exactly the same I
tried my best but I feel like it
actually completes the photo and it
makes it look a lot like Gigi's I really
loved the fact that it was a little bit
windy when I took this photo cuz I
managed to get that same like hair in
the wind kind of effect that Gigi's got
in her photo honestly I didn't expect
that I'd be able to get that same like
windswept effect but I somehow did so I
mean I think that deserves a like for
this video you guys honestly I think
this photo is gonna be my favorite
recreation of the whole video I'm
already getting premonitions I just I
just know this is gonna be my favorite
so now we're gonna move on to photo and
number three
okay so I'm ready for the next photo
this is the look so basically I try to
replicate her makeup as close as I could
but obviously it's not gonna be exactly
the same I try to do like the white
waterline as you can see and the really
bold thick liner I think the most
difficult part of this photo is going to
be recreating the hair because she's got
like random strands of hair all over her
face and I feel like that would just be
so difficult to try and do but I'm gonna
try my best to replicate this photo this
is the aftermath of that photo oh my god
I have so many random strands of hair
all over my face we actually have to wet
my hair to make it look like GG's
obviously I didn't want to wet my whole
head of hair so we only wet these little
strands here it still didn't look quite
right it was very difficult to try to
position them in the exact same place
but we tried our best so let's take a
look at the photo so this is the outcome
of photo number three honestly I don't
really know if I like it that much like
I loved GG's photo but I'm not sure if
I'm in love with my photo I feel like I
managed to get it pretty close with like
the ko the only thing that was really
difficult was the hair like all the
little strands over her face it was just
so difficult to place them the same way
that she has it I feel like I didn't
enjoy taking this photo as much just
because it was a little bit difficult
and very fiddly with the hair obviously
photoshopped it black and white and also
I changed the background from white to
at this grayish sort of color that she's
got in her photo too I mean I'm not the
biggest fan it's definitely my least
favorite photo so far but let me know
what you guys think okay so now let's
move onto photo and number four
so photo number four is this one right
here this is kind of like a selfie
starfighter I suppose I try to find a
red top like hers but I really couldn't
find anything so I'm just wearing this
red dress so we're gonna just pretend
that it's a red top I actually couldn't
manage to get any of the same jewelry or
anything even remotely similar to this
photo the only thing I managed to get is
some red earrings so what I plan to do
is cheat a little bit and I'm gonna
probably Photoshop the necklace and the
ring onto my original photo so I've
tried to do my makeup very similar to
hers I've got the bold winged liner yet
again and a nude lip so let's see if we
can replicate this photo she gotta be
there
nothing alike that one was actually
really difficult to do I mean I couldn't
really get the angle or the lighting
right so I'm gonna have to work a little
bit of Photoshop magic on that photo to
try and make it look a little bit better
cuz the lighting just wasn't exactly the
same so we're gonna try and make do so
let's go ahead and see how the photo
turned out this a photo you guys it was
so difficult to recreate I thought this
would be one of the easiest ones because
it's kind of like a selfie star photo
but it was just so difficult to get that
same angle that Gigi's got like her head
is so highly tilted up and I just look
like a potato when I do that I honestly
don't know how Gigi does this but she
nationhood just looks perfect from every
angle whereas when I was trying to like
lift my head like this
it just looked completely wrong I
literally just look like a thumb no joke
so yeah this photo is definitely kind of
like in the bottom two with the black
and white one it's not really my
favorite but let's move on it to photo
and number five okay so this is the last
outfit this is what it looks like
everything a wearing is from ASOS
including the fur coat now the photo and
the top is a little bit of a different
color so we're just gonna have to deal
with that but it is quite a close match
I mean like the whole outfit looks
pretty similar so I'm pretty happy with
it
so this is our makeshift coalition we
just turned a dining table on the side
to try and basically act as you know the
photo number five was really difficult
to recreate because I didn't really have
the same background so from what I can
see in the photo GD it stood outside
with maybe like a paparazzi taking some
flash photography of her though I know
should just had to kind of take it in
pitch black and make it look as similar
to hers as possible so this is what the
photo looks like obviously my top was a
lot different so I had to edit the top
color in a Photoshop to make it look
like GG's I feel like the biggest
challenge of all was trying to find a
similar clothing to what she was wearing
because obviously she's a supermodel
she's gonna wear a lot of designer
clothes so I mean I was just kind of
like looking on a budget like on ASOS so
I tried my best with finding its similar
clothes to her I feel like my hair looks
the closest to hers in this photo cuz
obviously she's got kind of like an
ombre thing going on whereas all of the
other photo she was either a full
brunette or a full blonde so this photo
I feel like it was just made for me to
recreate so those are all of the photos
that I'm gonna be recreating of for
today I honestly had so much fun doing
this video it definitely got me to be a
lot more creative in my photography and
my like modeling skills if any of you
guys are wondering where I got all the
clothes or if you like any particular
piece I'll have all of the clothing
links and down below so you guys can
check those out definitely let me know
which one of these photos was your
favorite and the comments I think my
favorite was definitely the Vogue cover
because I just feel like it looks the
closest also if you guys would like to
see more of these types of videos
definitely let me know what celebrity
you would like me to copy next because I
feel like this is a really fun video
idea I would love to do maybe like
kendall Jenner or I don't know maybe
someone that's got like similar hair to
me let me know in the comments if you
