back to my channel today I am gonna be
applying a full face only concealer this
is gonna be a challenge I'm not gonna
lie now I got this idea from a mani MUA
here on YouTube haven't actually watched
his video but I saw it in my
subscription feed I was like oh my god
this is such a good video idea yeah 4
credits to him I'll link his video down
below and also I'm really excited
because this video is actually in
collaboration with the Nivea you guys
know I love Nivea I've honestly used
Nivea for like all my life like since I
was a kid so I'm super excited for this
collaboration and I mean after ruining
my whole face with concealer today we're
definitely gonna be needing that Nivea
skin care I honestly have no idea how
this video is gonna go so please have
your fingers crossed for me and also
give this video a thumbs up if you enjoy
but without further ado let's get on
into the video ok so here I have my
whole array of different colors of
concealer ready for this look of course
I'll have all of the products that I use
in this video down in the description so
you guys gonna check those out so the
first thing I'm gonna be using is this
concealer right here it's kind of like a
liquidy formula so it's gonna act as at
my foundation I feel like using
concealer as foundation isn't actually
that weird like when I was younger I
would actually use concealer like all
over my face instead of foundation for
years I actually probably picked up my
first foundation when I was like 17
years old which is kind of weird when
you think about it but I just feel like
concealer works way better for me than
foundation and that is my foundation
uh-huh I'm now just gonna blend
everything out with a Beauty Blender
this honestly isn't looking that much
different to when I actually apply
foundation so so far so good
next up we're gonna actually use a
concealer for the right purpose and
we're gonna move on to actual concealers
I'm just gonna apply that under my eyes
and kind of highlight with the LOA as
well I'm so gutted they don't make like
shimmery highlighters because I am so
gonna be missing out on the glow today
okay so I'm just blending out the
concealer with a slightly smaller Beauty
Blender I think concealer and
highlighter I like my favorite part of
makeup because they just literally
transform your face so much and if
you're anything like me I have the worst
like under-eye circles so you can see
those definitely my products okay so now
I'm gonna move on to contouring I'm
actually a little bit nervous for this
because I
never contoured with a concealer now
this is quite a lot darker than my skin
tone and I feel like it's gonna be a
little bit too dark but we're just gonna
see okay so I'm just gonna do the usual
cheekbones temples and nose this is
actually such a nice concealer color
like it's not even orange or anything
and then I'm just gonna take my Beauty
Blender and attempt to blend this it oh
my goodness right I got a quick I don't
want it to set on my face
let's blend it out really good actually
I am pleased with that I might actually
consider using concealer like to
actually use this contour cuz it's
blending in like a dream I feel like my
nose contour is going a little bit crazy
so that's my contour finished I am
actually really pleased as to how this
turned out it's all blend it's super
well I have no issues at all so far now
I'm moving into blusher when I was
planning out this video I was like what
the heck am I gonna use for like colors
on my face because I mean obviously
concealers are in a spectrum from like
light to dark brown essentially so color
was definitely the problem here however
I thought did hit me hit me like a bag
and I thought to myself oh my god what
about like color corrector so I picked
up this orange color correcting a
concealer which I'm gonna be using kind
of all over like I'm gonna be using it
as blush lipstick maybe even through the
crease if I can like make it happen so
I'm just gonna dab a little bit of that
on it's like a really nice orange color
and I'm just gonna blend that in with my
Beauty Blender I put on a little bit too
much I might have to diffuse this with
like the concealer this is really
difficult I'm getting all kinds of
creases under my eyes cuz I can't set it
cuz I can't use powder or why I am so
tangoed right now I literally look like
I've got two oranges on my cheek right
we gotta get this under control guys I'm
gonna pop over a little bit more
of the foundation concealer that we used
previously I just it doesn't look so
Orange I feel like they've messed up now
okay so so far I feel like it's been
quite easy-peasy I mean we've got a
little bit of a situation on the cheeks
going on but we handled it we took care
of it
so I'm now gonna move on to my brows now
now this is gonna be the hardest part I
can tell you now therefore the browser
I've got literally the darkest shade of
concealer I could find at the drugstore
and I really hope it's gonna make my
brows look semi decent at least so this
is how dark it is I feel like it should
match my brows pretty well I'm just
gonna play this with a very thin angled
brush you know it's actually not looking
that bad like it's not too warm tired I
was kind of worried that it would be
really warm tone it's definitely got
like a ready sort of undertone to it but
it's not that bad
I'm gonna try and like replicate the
strokes but I can already tell I'm gonna
have like the boldest
thick is brows by the end of this video
okay so the brow is definitely a lot
darker than I usually go for but we're
just gonna roll with it there is
literally so much pressure to get this
right I'm like barely even breathing
doing this brow right now okay the
browser on there looking kind of dark so
I'm just gonna try and like brush the
front of the brows out a little bit but
I don't think it's going to do that much
now the next part is probably the
hardest part of this video and that is
the eye makeup so I'm basically gonna
take a bit of all of these concealers
and just make a little concoction on the
back of my hand and just try and come up
with like a shadow Jay so first up I'm
gonna take my foundation sort of shade
and also the orangey like color
correcting shade and I'm just gonna mix
them together on the back of my hand so
try and create like a transition color I
guess right so that's my little
concoction right
yes girl look at that that is a nice
color
once again Picasso you better watch out
okay so I'm just gonna try and apply
this through the crease oh my god is
actually working look at this this is so
easy to blend I mean it is concealer
that actually looks really good what do
you guys think I am actually shook at
how good this is turning out okay so I'm
not going to take this medium brown
concealer and just kind of pop that on
the back of my hand as well
and I'm gonna be using this to kind of
darken up the orange shade and kind of
mix it to be more of like a smokey
effect to add a little bit more depth
into the eye okay so I'm gonna apply the
darker brown shade just on in the outer
corner of the eye this eye look is
honestly the wettest I look I have ever
created because obviously I can't really
set it right now okay so the eyes are
somewhat there now I mean I kind of
messed it up a little bit like right
here it's not like a crisp edge or
anything just because I was trying to
use my fingers to like blend in and
stuff I feel like I'm gonna have to and
neaten this up a little bit so this is
where my nephew wipes come in handy I'm
just gonna take one of these and kind of
sharpen up the shape of the eye look
just a little bit oh these smell so good
if you guys haven't tried these yet you
need to they are so good for like eyes
because they're super gentle I'm just
gonna take it on my finger and let you
just carve it out like that do you see
how much difference that's made now
that's what I'm talking about
you can never tell this is done with
concealer could you so now I'm gonna
return back to the darkest shade of
concealer that I could find and I'm just
gonna try and use this as like a
eyeliner sort of thing it's gonna be a
very diffused and subtle eyeliner but I
still want it to like add a little bit
of something to this so I'm just gonna
use a little like angled brush and just
pick up some of the product this is
where I mess up guys honestly oh my god
this is so difficult because this
concealer so watery oh my god this is
not going to plan I mean I guess it's
not that bad but it just wouldn't be my
choice of way let's try and it's have
the other eye this is so not gonna match
I just messed up but the good thing
about concealer is that you can just
literally wipe it away unlike eyeliner
oh my god so my eyeliner is now finished
it doesn't look okay I have no idea I
feel like as soon as I blink is just
gonna copy and paste the eyeliner on my
eye man it was definitely hard to work
with because it was just so watery and
just not as opaque as eyeliner but I
have to say at the end of the day the
wing doesn't look at our bad I'm
actually not gonna reply any mascara or
lashes just because I feel like it's
cheating so I'm gonna leave it how it is
and I'm gonna move on to some lips now
I'm gonna be using the trusty orange
shade for the lip once again so much
you're just gonna take this a medium
brown shade first to kind of like over
line my lips a little bit okay I am kind
of shook like this concealer actually
works really well as lipliner it just
kind of feels like I'm applying liquid
lipstick so that's a little lip liner
done I'm now just gonna take the orange
color and just pop that in the center of
my lid to kind of create like a slight
ombre effect this is actually a really
pretty color for the lip as well okay so
this is the look complete I actually
feel like I've done a pretty good job I
feel like this proves that if you could
only carry around concealers you could
actually do a full face of makeup which
is actually insane when you think about
it it's a very matte look I am
definitely missing the highlighter but
it's not bad but let me know what you
guys think so although I feel like this
was actually quite a successful video my
face does feel really dry just because
I've got so much product and it's all
concealer and concealer tends to be
quite drying for me personally so I am
gonna remove this which is the best part
of any makeup day and for this I'm gonna
be using the Nivea micellar skin
breather micellar water this has no
residue and it's perfect for sensitive
skin like mine so if you guys haven't
tried it you totally should because I
honestly uses every single day so I'm
just gonna dig into my face and just
remove like all this orange enos look at
that
oh my god there is literally nothing
better than taking off all your makeup
after a long day I've been filming for
myself today so I'm like so happy I get
to take all this makeup at home and
lastly to take my eye makeup off I'm
just gonna take this one right here this
is the
your double effect and makeup remover
this one's really good for removing
waterproof makeup so you just meant to
like shake it like this which is really
fun and then I'm just gonna apply this
to the cotton bud and or remove my eye
makeup oh yeah look at that
that's like taking it off in like one
swipe so now I am makeup free I'm gonna
take this cream right here.this is the
regenerating night cream it is nighttime
now and I'm filming this so this is
perfect
I love applying quite a thick layer of
this overnight and it just literally
moisturized my skin so much as I'm
sleeping and then when I apply make up
the next day I feel like my foundation
just glides on so much smoother and
lastly we can not forget about the lips
because honestly my lips get so dry
especially at this time of year so I've
got the original Kerr lip balm by Nivea
and I'm just going to apply this all
over my lips you don't want no chapped
lips girlfriend so that is my makeup off
and my night skincare routine complete
honestly I had so much fun filming this
video definitely let me know what you
guys thought of the makeup look that I
achieved we've literally just concealers
it was actually quite challenging but I
think I did okay I think I actually did
okay but anyways that is all for my
video thank you so much for watching and
I hope to see you guys in my next one
