thought it would be what is up everyone
welcome back to a channel so for today's
video I'm just gonna be doing my
everyday it's sort of a makeup routine
I'm just kidding guys it's today I have
these tiny little hands made out of
rubber and I thought it would be quite
funny to do like a challenge where I
have to apply a full face of makeup to
my face using nothing but these so wish
me luck just so you guys know this video
idea is not my own so do not come for me
I will link my inspiration that are down
below in the description so you guys can
check it out it was an instagramer that
I initially saw do there so I thought I
would kind of come on here and give it a
try myself actually really creepy how
realistic these little hands look we
have like all of the little crevices of
the skin and everything if you guys want
to see how I'm gonna do my makeup with
these two hands let's get on into the
video okay what do I begin my honestly
feel like this is the weirdest video I
have ever done so for today's foundation
this is the one I'm gonna be using this
is the Maybelline Dream satin foundation
this is one of my favorite so here I
have just a tiny bit of my foundation as
you can see it matches my skin really
really well
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
rub that in there I'm thinking of using
my hands today just you know to use the
warmth of my fingers to blend that in
really well into the skin oh yes we have
the got on lavender on go this actually
feels really nice it kind of feels like
a faith massage all gonna get that
forehead as well can't forget that as
much as I love using my hands for my
foundation I think it's time to use that
the trusty good old beauty blender so
I'm just gonna take that in my hands and
just bounce it on the skin you guys know
the drill go to get that flawless finish
the next product I'm gonna use is my
trusty tar shake tip concealer this does
such a good job of concealing my
under-eye bags and let's just say my
under-eye bags are not Gucci so they
need to go oh my god this is gonna be so
hard oh my god that's going all over my
jumper
let's do this one I almost poked my eye
out to where then just gonna take our
trusty Beauty Blender we're just gonna
take our trusty Beauty Blender and just
blend this bad boy out easy peasy
perfect so to set my face I'm gonna take
a powder this is the one I'll be using
today this is actually not as hard as I
thought it would be I take that back
the next product I'm gonna be using is
this holographic palette from a pretty
little thing
this is the face compact kit now I'm
gonna be using at the bronzer from at
this palette I'm gonna take that and
kind of just chisel out them cheekbones
kind of carve them out you know get that
shadow poppin in there a lot of people
are kind of scared of contour and I feel
like it's just one of the easiest things
you can do in makeup I mean look how
effortless that looks it just looks so
good and natural I mean if I was walking
down the street and you saw me I don't
think you could even tell that I'm
wearing makeup to be honest it's just
one of those steps you definitely don't
want to miss just because look how good
it looks could also get up in those
temples as well if you like if you feel
like your contour looks a little bit too
much you can obviously just go in with
your hand and blend it out as well if
needs be your hands are the only tool in
life that comes for free so you best
utilize that tool I mean look at that
I look bronzed to the gods next up we
don't want to miss a blusher so here I
have at my blush Leffler so here I have
my blush brush now a quick tip I have it
for blush users out there is to kind of
just hold your brush there and just kind
of do this now I know this kind of looks
ridiculous but hear me out not only are
you really nicely applying your blush to
your face but also you're kind of
stimulating your neck so you're not
gonna get some really nasty neck cramps
lifehacks okay so now my blush is on I'm
now gonna move on
my eyes for my eyeshadow today I'm gonna
use the semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
from Too Faced it's so good I almost
want to eat it oh it smells so good run
my palette today I'm gonna be taking
this a gorgeous kind of orangey color
right here and I'm just gonna pop that
all throughout the crease so what you
want to do is you want to just kind of
blend that all throughout the crease
with a kind of heavy hand you definitely
want the pigment to be showing and I
love to use these sort of colors on my
eyes just because I feel like it really
brings out the blue in my eyes so my
everyday sort of makeup usually consists
of this sort of load I only ever really
use one shadow like there's a lot of
sake of this video I'm gonna go all out
so I'm gonna make it extra special and
I'm gonna use one of these copper
shadows all over the lid and kind of
blend it into the rest of my eye so I'm
just gonna blend this all the way onto
the lid and into the transition shadow
just because you want everything super
blended blending is absolute key so it's
definitely gonna make you look a like a
pro I mean look how gorgeous that looks
it just looks so natural next step is to
add some eyeliner so for this I'm gonna
be using this Stila liner this is one of
my favorites because the tip is so super
fine and it's super easy to use
luckily I'm actually really good at this
so I'm just gonna kind of go for like a
very subtle everyday sort of liner you
know perfect
remember eyeliners are not meant to be
twins they're sisters so if one of your
eyeliners ends up a little bit wonky and
don't sweat it I mean look at that I
mess up a little bit but what's the fun
in having the same eyeliner on both eyes
I feel like matching eyeliner is so
overrated so that is my eyeliner
finished I mean like I said they don't
really match per se but I think it looks
really good now to finish off the eyes
I'm just gonna use some mascara this is
the benefit bad girl bang mascara it is
so good small hands I wish I knew the
rest of the lyrics to the song I don't
even know whose song that is of One
Direction that's so bad so those are my
eyes are completely done I think they
look really good hands down at 10
now for the lips I am gonna use this
right here this is a wire some lipstick
is very red so if I drop this on the
floor I'm dead again this is just a very
subtle color
I mean nudes are so overrated am i right
I mean look at that application that is
just pure skill don't even need a lip
liner Oh God Almighty I feel like I
could totally be a makeup artist and
actually charge people to do their
makeup cuz I mean this just looks
amazing I'm kind of getting mirandasings
vibes from this let's just say that's
the look I was going for so this is the
complete and finished everyday makeup
look I mean what's not to love about it
I think it just looks really really
natural very pretty for everyday
lipstick I mean like I said new too just
a bit too overrated for me now the
eyeliner yeah it doesn't really match
but let's just say that that's the kind
of look I was going for I mean like I
said just having matching eyeliner is so
overrated and I think my contour my skin
just looks so flawless it kind of looks
airbrushed to be honest so let me know
what you guys think of this look if you
guys enjoyed it do give it a big thumbs
up I can't do a thumbs up with these
hands so let's just pretend that I'm
doing a thumbs up right now no serious
no oh my god I feel like this is the
most sarcastic video I have ever felt it
doesn't look all these hands I'm making
my fingers sweat like this actual sweat
deal this was so much fun to film with
these little hands like it was actually
a big challenge to do my makeup and I
don't think I did a good job to be
honest but it's just a little bit of fun
I hope you guys it did enjoy it too I
had so much fun using these little
plastic hands if you guys want to get
some yourself I'll link them down below
we got a run to use in the hands to
point they're just so weird they
actually look so realistic they have
like all the veins and like all the
crevices you can bend them as well so
anyways if that was the video for today
I honestly have no idea where I was
going with this video idea but I just
wanted to do it cuz it seemed like a lot
of fun and I just thought it would be a
la this video is by no shape or form
meant to be taken seriously and let's be
honest it was a hundred one percent you
so at least if you guys enjoyed it do
let me know and hopefully it put a smile
on your face if you guys are brand new

family before you leave but that is all
