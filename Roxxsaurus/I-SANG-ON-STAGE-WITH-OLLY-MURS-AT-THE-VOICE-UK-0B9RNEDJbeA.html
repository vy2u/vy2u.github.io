mean I mean what about it pearls going
on Wow okay Nick my little for the
weekend that's what I was gonna wear
anytime that is Mike good to see you
five bloggers okay so we are now at the
Blue Room let's go guys I am now joined
by Lauren Murphy which is the makeup
artist for Nivea hello
so since today I have a professional
makeup artist on my channel I thought
it'd be really cool to ask you from of
my viewers some burning questions that
they had about like skincare and makeup
yeah and yeah we'll just kind of learn a
little bit late let's do it so the first
question comes from our and she asks
when wearing foundation my nose start of
super dry and then it turns early after
a couple of hours what can I do to
balance this out so I would say first
step is always at masking care so make
sure that you're not using any products
that are really stripping your skin to
make your nose super dry yes using the
place where you produce the most oil and
so once you've kind of cleanse well and
hydrated the skin use an oil-free primer
on the nose and that will really help to
control the shine throughout the day and
then you've got block tissues so that
once you've applied your foundation you
can just dab any shine throughout the
day you could also look for an oil-free
foundation because that will help
because it doesn't have to be matte you
can still get like a semi natural matte
foundation yeah early but yeah perhaps
using less oil yeah I think I think the
blotting sheets is definitely a really
good one like when I used to have really
super oily skin at school I would always
just like touch-up with the blotting
sheets and they were like a lifesaver
yeah they are and they're so easy to
just have in your bag I clue yeah we
have to top up of any more makeup
definitely so the next question comes
from bags and she asks how do you get
flawless base and what primer would you
recommend so I think flawless base is
just so important before applying
foundation like you have to like
moisturize your skin and
I can get it to like the best state that
I can before applying foundation I think
yeah before I start any makeup skincare
again is always my first practice always
about cleanse in our skin and make sure
the skin is really hydrated because if
your skin is dehydrated it's going to
suck all the moisture out of any how I
cut products that you use and you're
just not going to get that flawless
finish yeah and you'll get those like a
little dry patches and yeah it's just
really like hydrating dewy foundation
could actually look really quite matte
on you yeah skin's not well hydrated so
definitely starting with prepping the
skin using the correct skin care and
moisturizing hydrating and then you can
use a primer again I always use primers
and there's different primers for
different skin types which really works
if you've got an oily skin and you look
for a mattifying primer and then a
hydrating primer if you're a bit
dehydrated or again you can add in an
illuminator yeah so many options and
that will really help to give that fluid
smell what would you say your favorite
primer is their like what kind what type
um I love a hydrating primer
yeah cuz that's what my skin skin tends
to go get out to you hydrate you
sometimes and I love the Laura Mercier
illuminating primer that's a good one I
think my favorite one yeah yeah that's
really good actually
and I think my favorite is the YSL
Touche clap for that primer it has like
that silky sort of finish and it just
glides on the face like it makes your
pores so like tiny you can again but
it's like a foundation you really have
got so many different time yeah so it's
worth trying them all and finding out
what works best for you definitely the
next question comes from Manasi I hope
I'm saying that right and she asks I
have a very oily t-zone and the rest of
my skin is completely dry how do you
take care of such skin this is such a
common problem so many people do stuff
with this and it's important to know
difference between dry and dehydrated
skin and dry skin is where it's actually
more flaky and patchy so you want to be
making sure you're using the correct
products for that something I love is to
face map with face masks and it really
helps to balance the skin and that is
generally what it is your skin is out of
balance and the t-zone is the area that
produces the most oil so I like to use a
really detoxifying and purifying mask on
the t-zone
the Nivea's urban detox mask is
brilliant for that
yeah draws out all the impurities and
helps to kind of refine the pores and
improve the appearance and then for like
the cheeks area something hydrating so
much more hydrating mask would work
better on that area because you really
want to boost the hydration and plump
the skin a bit yeah for sure yeah I feel
like a lot of the time when people get
oily t-zone they kind of think oh no i
can't use moisturizing anything because
ya add to it but I think it's like
almost a cry for help it's like it can
mean that sometimes the skin is too dry
that's why it's producing extra burns
yeah yes it definitely that's why it's
skincare you need to make sure you get
put up and then I go back to it as well
you know try and look for all your free
products you can get all three
moisturizers yeah and also all three
foundations if you are finding that
you're having a problem with that or you
know you're getting locked paws then
definitely try and go oil-free for sure
so the next question comes from Meg and
she says I have oily skin and I am so in
love with the look of dewy skin but I
actually struggled to make it look good
and last on my skin any suggestions yes
so instead of opting for a really oily
foundation or even a really dewy
foundation you could go for like it semi
matte a lot more of a natural finish so
you've still got that skin like low and
then you can add in a cream highlighter
to your foundation yes in like the areas
where you want to apply glue and apply
it to the skin so you're still going to
get that glow and then you've got
highlighters so you've got so many
options like one of my favorites is the
amani fluid shear one hmm and then one
of my powder favorites has got to be the
dog Ella
you know the baked ones they're
brilliant so again it's all about
finding correct formulas for you oh yeah
and you can make it work so I think
powders would be good for people with
oily skin as well because it's just
gonna like set almost set the you know
the oils and the skin a little bit and
kind of keep it under control rather
than like using creamy products as well
I'm tipping and the last question that
comes from Helen and she says I have
very dry skin especially on my face when
I get out of the shower I use a face
wash it but nothing seems to me
get soft oh well I would say my favorite
is the Nivea lights daily moisturizing
cream because it's really hydrating it's
not too rich on the skin but you will
find that it really does kind of boost a
complexion and you make it feel soft
yeah I mean because you've said a daily
moisturizer I'm gonna use like a night
one for this video and I think the
regenerating night cream is so good like
I've recently spoken about it in a video
and I loved it because I just actually
put like a very thick layer of it
overnight and then in the morning when I
wake up and I apply my foundation it's
like such a smooth applicable your night
regime is really really important
exactly that's when your skin is
repairing itself so you have to be put
in all that moisture and nutrients back
in and really aid that repair and so the
reason I suggest the new daily light
moisturizer is going to be up in two so
you need to case that's very good so
those are all other questions we'll be
answering it today thank you so much for
coming my channel thank you and I really
hope you guys enjoyed this little Q&amp;amp;A
and found something helpful from it as
well I've definitely learned a lot from
you so thank you so we are just about to
speak to some more singers so let's go
outside saying like everyone needs this
grooming saying is that literally 20
different balls honestly I'm not saying
