channel so for today's video I have a
yet another Primark haul because I mean
do I need an excuse I always feel like
I'm giving you guys excuses whenever I
do Primark halls but honestly I just
went with one thing and I ended up with
these two packs they just have so many
cute things in Primark at the moment and
especially because I'm going on holiday
soon I just thought might as well get
some new things for the holes if you
guys enjoy Primark hauls or in general
just fashion videos then give this video
a huge thumbs up and also don't forget
to subscribe but Cohen join the dinosaur
family but anyway so without further ado
I have it two bags to get through so
let's get on into the video so today's
haul is gonna be in no particular order
I think I'm actually gonna start off
with accessories because I'm so excited
for this a particular bag though when I
saw this I was like oh my god this
literally gives me such Chanel vibes and
this is and so basically it's like a
quilted backpack it's got two straps on
the back which are like chain and then
half like pleather and it's got a little
snake detail which kind of makes me
think of like Prada a little bit and
this kind of like chevron pattern makes
me think of wire sell so it's kind of
like three different designer bags in
one or this quilted pad at the top
definitely makes me think of Chanel and
I've always wanted a Chanel backpack but
they're so expensive and also Chanel
doesn't do any phone leather like items
so I am very very upset about that so I
picked myself up this one now this was
only 12 pounds which is just insane I am
absolutely loving this I can't wait to
take it on holiday
it looks very spacious as well and it's
just gonna look so cute I then picked up
another backpack just because you can
never have enough backpacks honestly I
feel like backpacks on holiday are a
must like I don't have enough of them so
I really liked this one it's kind of
like nude it's got gold detailing like
this little strap and also the zippers
gold it's kind of wide but this is gonna
be perfect for when I carry around my
huge vlogging camera so that's exactly
why I picked this one up and this was
only ten pounds which again is such a
bargain now the next item is actually a
pair of shoes so I just bought these
little slip on a white trainers well
they're already trained as like
just like slip-on shoes and these have a
really cool quoted effect once again I
don't know if you'll be able to see that
on camera but I feel like quilting is so
on trend at the moment I actually got
these in a size six because I don't know
what it is but I feel like my foot has
grown I've been in size five four years
since I was a teenager but all of a
sudden my foot has decided to grow so I
had to get a size up these are just so
cute I feel like that's such an easy
thing to wear really and these will go I
just broke my dry shampoo look at this
this is come off because the shoe landed
on it Wow so yeah these are just really
really cute they'll be easy to slip on
on holiday and they will go with
everything I then picked up a polka dot
Minnie Mouse top as you guys can tell I
am vibing with the polka-dots right now
so I basically picked this up because I
thought that this would be really cute
you like where every day to be honest
but also when I go to Disneyland I love
wearing Disneyland like merch so this
would be really really cute with maybe
like some dungarees or a dungaree dress
this was very inexpensive yet again it
was eight pounds and the fabric is super
super nice there's so many ways you can
wear this top and I mean who doesn't
love Disney next thing I got is this a
little crop top that just says smile in
red I really like this cuz it's super
simple and you can totally dress it up
and this was only 5 pounds I am living
for tops like this at the moment because
you can just pop it on with like a pair
of jeans or something and it just makes
such a cute but easy outfit to wear this
is boring but I then just got some up
bras because I absolutely love the
Primark bras they fit so well and these
no t-shirt bras are just a lifesaver so
if you haven't tried these you need to
there so is so cheap as well that only
two pounds each so can't go wrong the
next item I got is this a little clutch
bag this isn't such a nice nude color
again it's got that like quilted chevron
sort of design it actually comes with
quite a short strap which is kind of
unusual because I actually expected this
to have a really long strap that you can
kind of wear on your shoulder however it
doesn't but that's not too big of a deal
it's probably more of like a nighttime a
kind of bag that you can hold as a
clutch like this I've actually worn this
bag already when I was shooting with
Nivea in London
you guys might have seen it on my
Instagram if you follow me on there this
bag looks so much more expensive than it
is it was only six pounds but to be
honest it kind of looks designer to me
the next thing I got is this cute little
pair of shorts which again is gonna be
perfect for the summer holidays I
absolutely love the pale pink sort of
color and the pattern is so cute it's
actually got like two layers it's got
this kind of like flower design where
all of the flowers are actually cut out
of the fabric and I absolutely love the
hem of the shorts as well but underneath
it's got a little under layer so that
obviously your skin isn't on show
through all the little cutouts which is
really nice these are so soft and cozy
and this was only eight pounds I then
picked up some little earrings these are
just adorable and I feel like they go
with everything in this whole pretty
much because everything seems to be
quite nude and pastel pink is for only
three pounds and they honestly look so
so good so tassel earrings have been so
on trend recently and if you're not sure
about it and you want to try it out head
over to Primark cause honestly they do
some really cool ones for super
affordable the next item I got is at
this tropical jumpsuit which goes all
the way down to the floor it's actually
got like cinched in sort of legs as well
and on the side of the leg it's got like
this black stripe going all the way down
also got a little thing that you can
kind of tie around your waist to cinch
it in even more I just thought this
would be really nice for like an evening
when you're going out on holiday or
something I absolutely love jumpsuits
because they're so easy to wear because
you don't have to like pick out an
outfit but I don't wear them enough so
buying this will hopefully get me to
wear more jumpsuits and this jumpsuit
was a 13 pounds and then also got some
basic white crop tops the first one is
this one when I saw this I thought this
would be really cute to kind of dress up
with some denim shorts or like a ripped
denim jacket this was only four pounds
it looks kind of basic but I really love
at basic pieces like this that you can
just dress up and then I have another
one of which is this it's kind of got a
little bit more detail it's got little
buttons in the middle and this one was
four pounds as well okay I've got some
more nude / pink items the first one is
this one it's kind of like a oversized
cinched in top basically just like a
loose t-shirt I really like that the
batwing kind of sleeve to it I like the
fact that it's already tied because I
like to tie
my tops all the time when I'm wearing
jeans or Schwartz and this was four
pounds against it's a very affordable
little basic piece I then picked up
another pair of shoes
so these I've actually worn already
which is why they're a little bit dirty
already but these are so cute they look
so much more expensive than they are yet
again there were only six pounds you
guys I absolutely love the color of them
that they are so comfortable to just run
around town in and they've got a little
like gold studs all over them which just
adds that little bit of texture to your
outfit I am absolutely loving these if
you guys are looking for some like easy
slip-on shoes for quite affordable get
yourself these because these are so
comfortable and the very last thing is
totally not related to summer at all but
it's this jumper I mean you probably
could still wear this in the summer I
mean you probably still could wear this
in the summer we get plenty of cold days
here in the UK it's just like this
oversized blue striped navy kind of
jumper I really love how soft this is
it's kind of like lined with this fleecy
sort of fabric on the inside and it is
just the softest thing I've ever touched
this was at 7 pounds so again very
affordable and I just really really
liked the color it's not something I
usually would pick out but now that I've
got it I'm gonna rock you and that is
everything for today's Primark haul I
really love a good old Primark haul you
