today as you can tell by the title I
have a Primark haul for you guys now I
went into Primark and I literally picked
up like full bags worth of stuff I I
just can't help myself when I get to
program does anyone else out there like
this and let me know in the comments
because I feel like I go in there to
pick up one specific thing and I end up
buying everything so that is precisely
why I have four bags of these if you
guys are brand new and haven't seen my
face before hi I'm Roxy come enjoying at
the dinosaur family by subscribing down
below and also don't forget to click the
notification Bell button to stay
notified of every time I post a new
video anyways I feel like this hall is
gonna be super long so without further
ado let's get on into the video okay so
I have kind of got on a bit denim mad
over the past couple of days I have no
idea why but when I went in to Primark I
saw so many cute denim bits I just had
to pick up so the first thing being out
of the many things that I picked up
which are denim is this denim jacket so
this is a basically like a light wash
denim jacket that I got for 20 pounds I
have picked up quite a few denim jackets
from Primark in my previous hauls but
the reason why I liked this one is
because it's very light wash and I feel
like I don't actually own a light wash
jacket like this I got this in a size 12
because I feel like it's just gonna look
a little bit cuter if it's a little bit
oversized so yeah this is what it looks
like I would say this is a really nice
quality jacket that I think is
definitely worth 20 pounds as well as
denim I've been a little bit just a
little bit obsessed with Disney stuff
and I'm actually going away to Disney
like literally this weekend
so as I'm uploading this I would have
been coming back home if you guys are
interested to see what I get up to at
Disneyland Paris I will have a vlog up
in here so you guys can check that out
when it goes up but yes I have picked up
quite a few Disney things this is the
first item and it's just a little Disney
Mickey Mouse or Minnie Mouse cap and I
just think is the cutest thing ever oh
my god I mean this is definitely gonna
serve some very cute photos in
Disneyland so make sure you follow the
Instagram as well I just love this it's
just the cutest thing ever and it was
only 5 pounds so I mean bargain or wah
and then have another disney top which
it's just the most adorable
it's just like a striped black and white
top it's very like plain it's this
you're just a plain t-shirt but I like
it because you can just like tie it up
with some like jeans and it'll just look
really cute and it's got mini mounts
there which is so cute now the next item
I picked up I have seen all over like
Instagram like the Primark Instagram and
also a lot of bloggers have been talking
about this as well and that is this bout
which is kind of like the dupe of the
Gucci bow and this cost me four pounds
so I mean a pretty good it's just like a
simple black belt I hope this can be
used as like a waist belt I might have
to put some more holes in it it's not
gonna be like perfect for a waist belt
but it was four pounds now I have to say
I'm a little bit of a hypocrite for
getting is about because I did tweet
saying that I'm kind of over the whole
like Gucci belt thing but the reason is
because they are so overpriced
and literally every blogger on Instagram
is wearing them like am i right or am i
right but when I saw this I was like
well it's only four pounds so I mean if
even if I don't worry it's not that big
of a deal and I'm kind of excited to see
how I can stall this because I don't
really tend to wear belts very often the
next thing I picked up are some pairs of
jeans because I love primal jeans so
much so the first pair is this and the
reason why I pick this up is because
they have these really cool like fishnet
sort of I don't know effect underneath
the jeans and they're also ripped these
are girlfriend style so it's not really
like the ship that I would tend to go
for in jeans but I'm gonna give it a try
these were actually reduced from 17
pounds to only 10 pounds so if you guys
like the look of these and I want to
pick them up make sure you do because I
feel like they might be discontinuing
them soon if they're on sale but yeah
they're very cute it's definitely
something I would see in like Topshop or
a sauce so I picked these up as well as
well as those I also picked up another
pair of denim jeans literally I told you
guys I have an obsession right now but
these are just plain ripped skinny jeans
is not really too much - they kind of
have like a ripped hem as well which is
quite cool and these were how much were
you so these were 15 pounds of again
quite affordable for jeans so the next
item is another denim item which is just
like a little denim dress it's kind of
like a dungaree star dress this cost me
12 pounds and when I saw
I was like okay I need to get this I can
see it it's like a really cute outfit
and I really want to take it to
Disneyland with me as well I then picked
up some berries a berets yeah I've never
really worn bros before but I kind of
felt like you know I'm into France I
have no idea if this is gonna suit me at
all I don't know how to wear these can
someone help me I don't know I don't
know I'm gonna have to see if I can make
this work but I kind of like the look of
them they're just really cute these are
only four pounds so I got two different
shades because I don't know which one's
gonna match my coat better I don't
remember putting that in the basket
man the next item is another Disney item
and I'm really sorry if you don't like
Disney I mean if you don't then what is
wrong with you seriously I picked up
these and they are the cutest thing ever
they're just like little pajamas sure
they're really nice quality and they
were actually reduced they were only two
pounds reduced from four pounds now the
next item is a bit boring but I picked
up some hangers now I literally have so
many of these hangers and they are the
best they're just so cute they looks so
amazing in your wardrobe because they're
like nude and they're kind of like
velvety so your clothes don't slip off
of them so you get like 10 in a pack and
you pay four pounds for them so I feel
like that's quite a good price and I was
just basically running out so I need to
get some more now this next item is this
and I am in love with it it's so washed
out on camera though right it is it's
like a quilted Minnie Mouse bag it's got
like a really long gold chain and it's
just the most adorable thing I've ever
seen you guys are definitely gonna be
seeing this a lot on my Instagram and
also this was only eight pounds I mean
bar again this next item is probably and
a little bit more towards like summer
because they're very very summery and
it's these espadrille shoes which
literally look like the Chanel
espadrille but obviously they don't have
the Chanel logo at the front but they
are literally the exact same design so I
picked these up and I love them I've got
these in a size 5 if you're wondering
and these were 6 pounds which it's just
so good I mean I'm only going to
Disneyland Paris for literally the
weekend like two days I just picked up
so many Disney things
I just couldn't leave this behind it's
the cutest it's like a little Mickey
Mouse jumper and it says Mickey on the
sleeves in like a bright yellow color I
love it
I'm gonna have so many out for changes
purely for photos like I'm so sad the
next item I have picked up is this like
long cardigan /ko it's very thin for a
coat but I feel like it's kind of gonna
be good for spring maybe when it's a
little bit warmer so the material is
kind of like faux suede sort of material
and this was 20 pounds which again is
quite affordable for like a little
jacket like this it goes quite long and
I don't know I just really like this
color so I picked it out and then got a
few like summery tops again I just love
like a nice top and jeans like that is
my go-to outfit so I picked up this
little number and is literally white so
basically it's just like a ruched I
don't know I can't even see what is
going on you see now it's just like a
ruched white top it's off the shoulders
it's got like ruffles it's really really
pretty
and this was 10 pounds I then got
another like off the shoulders top this
one is actually in like a bright orange
a sort of red color it's a color I don't
usually go for but I really liked it and
I kind of want to get into reds a little
bit more because I feel like it suits my
hair color like I feel like red kind of
suits blondes so this was 4 pounds I
feel like yeah pretty good price for a
decent quality top then got another red
item and this is just like a knit red
jumper it's kind of cropped a little bit
and how much were you this was a 10
pounds again I got this in like a
slightly larger size because I kind of
like that oversized look and the very
last item I picked up is another pair of
shoes now these are a little bit more
appropriate for the weather and they're
just like a black pair of faux suede
booties and I really like these because
they have like her detailing across here
and if you guys will be able to see that
but it's just got like a braid sort of
strap along here which just gives it a
little bit of something and these were
14 pounds if you wonder it so that is
everything from my promo behind Primark
literally and never disappoints me I
love Primark so much there's always
something new there's always something
fresh so yeah I just really like it it's
definitely one of my favorite clothing
stores so I hope you guys don't mind me
doing hauls like this all the time
because everyone that's Primark let's be
honest but anyways that is all from me
and this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and got to see a little bit
of an insight as to what is it Primark
at the moment I hope I kind of inspired
you to pick up like some new pieces for
spring I feel like it's always nice to
see what other people are buying is

it's always good to get like fashion
inspirations so I hope you guys enjoyed
