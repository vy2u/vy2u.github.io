are the biggest clickbait i have ever
seen on the internet have stumbled
across a problem why is this so time
this was looks like I've got no neck it
screams I'm on a budget what's up guys
how's it going welcome back to my
channel so today I have another video
now I am really really excited for this
one because it's quite a requested video
from you guys I've been doing so many
like eBay sesh trying like different
fashion brands lately and you guys have
really seen me to enjoy those types of
videos at the moment so today I thought
I always try out some items up from at
the app called wish now wish is an
application for your phone where you can
pretty much buy all sorts of things like
makeup fashion clothing it has been
advertised a lot on pretty much all of
my social medias like Twitter Instagram
if you guys don't follow me on there
make sure you do thank you for Omo but
honestly I have been seeing this app
everywhere and I've never bought
anything from it because I kind of
thought it was a scam but I've been
seeing other people do videos on there
and I really want to try it myself now
which is literally so so cheap like most
of the items where 10 pounds were under
so I'm not too sure about the quality
but that's what this video is for there
is a very high risk of potentially
wasting 200 pounds on this video but
we're gonna see we're gonna see if you
guys enjoy these types of videos Maitri
smashed a huge thumbs up just down below
and also don't forget to subscribe but
come and join the dinosaur family but
without further ado let's get on into
the video hey hey guys so I have my
first item right here this is like a
two-piece set in the picture I look
pretty cute and this cost me 13 pounds
so I'm really interested to see if this
is gonna be any good so let's try it on
okay guys so this is the outfit let's
just pretend I'm not blending into the
wall right now so this now set was a 13
pounds like I said I feel like the
trousers fit really really nicely the
only thing I have to say is that they
are a little bit see-through like you
can see my underwear through it so
hats I'd have to wear white underwear
were there so I really like the fact
that it's got pockets like I always love
trousers with pockets now I have to say
I have a little bit of a situation with
the top like I tried to roll it up but
there is just literally so much fabric
on this that I could probably become a
snowman if I roll this over my face
there's just so much excess fabric and
whatever I do it just doesn't seem to
like sit right this is almost like I've
got no neck so yeah I don't really know
how I feel about the top half although
the pads fit really nice but I feel like
if they were wooden alone they probably
would end up looking like pajama bottoms
I have no idea if I'm ever gonna wear
this I'm gonna give this one a thumbs
down although it does look quite similar
to the picture that was listed on the
wish app like I feel like this is quite
close I mean yeah it looks a lot better
on the model definitely but pretty close
okay so for the next outfit I've got
these two items and now I have to say
this jumper already it looks nothing
like the picture of what I bought and
also a pair of jeans so let's get ready
so I am literally deceased at this
jumper right now this jumper right here
is honestly one of the biggest clickbait
I have ever seen on the Internet
basically this jumper is pretty much
nothing like the picture the color isn't
so off it's so much more pink than nude
like in the picture as you can see here
it is completely nude the sleeves don't
have this weird stuff for I can remember
I'm pretty sure it didn't have this
light with lace-up thing on each of the
sleeves it does still say not your baby
on the side but everything about it it's
just so off I read are like yeah the
fabric feels are so so cheap I honestly
expected a lot better from this jumper I
did only pay five pounds for this but in
the picture the jumper looks so much
better quality so I do really feel like
I was misled to buy it at the end of the
day five pounds is not that big of a
loss but I mean still like if I got this
in the post and I wanted to get this
jumper I would be pretty pissed as for
the jeans I feel like they're actually
quite nice when I first looked at them
before I put them on I felt like these
were gonna be so big and really not well
fitted to my body but they actually fit
really well around my waist which I'm
actually quite surprised about because I
can never find use that fit my waist and
my hips
same time and this is the original
picture so I feel like that quite close
to the photo now for the proton Perl
they use a model or for fashion Nova
that's not why I bought these because
when I did my fashion over video I
really liked their jeans obviously
clearly I wasn't gonna get fashion over
jeez for the amount that I paid but
still it was worth the try
the next item is this fleece jumper that
I'm about to try on this cost me six
pounds and it looked really cute in the
photo so let's try it off this literally
feels so cheep oh my god it's literally
like shedding fluff I don't know if
you'll be able to see this but all over
the sleeve there's like little chunks of
different colored like fluff from
probably all the other colors that they
you know produce of this jumper which is
just so weird okay so this definitely
looks a lot better on than it did when I
was just holding it up I feel like
actually doesn't look that bad now that
it's on but obviously it doesn't change
the quality it still feels really really
like cheap and the fabric just isn't as
nice as I thought it'd be
obviously I keep saying this but I
didn't expect amazing things anyways but
it's always good to see like what you do
actually gasps so this is the original
photo I feel like it doesn't really look
that close to here the color is
definitely really really off and just
the shape in general of the whole like
hoodie is I have just don't know there's
just something about it that doesn't
feel right the hoodie actually feels
quite snug sir I mean I'm not gonna
complain too much I can obviously wear
this around the house but I probably
wouldn't wear it out now for the next
item we're gonna be trying on this dress
right here which is just so beautiful I
want to see so impressed how close they
managed to get this dress to the
original photo on the listing I mean I
have no idea how this is gonna look on
whether it's gonna fit properly in all
the right places but let's try it on and
see you have stumbled across the problem
so I can't fit this dress over my hips
like wow this is a size ass I have got
it unzips now I literally cannot get it
over my hips why is this so time oh
we're getting there
we're getting there right wiggle our way
in that's the technique whoa okay trick
is to never breathe again okay
so despite the fact that I couldn't
initially fit into the stress I actually
really really like it it is so pretty I
mean look at it I feel like you can see
a little bit of my underwear underneath
but yet again at that song we can
definitely fake although I've got a size
S which is usually my size I feel like
this dress it's just a tad bit too tight
I really like that it's body Conan's
very well fitted but if I were you I
would definitely like slice art to be
honest this dress only cost me like
seven pounds and I just think it's so
pretty it's like so elegant but simple
so I might actually get myself like a
size up I'm actually so sure this dress
looks so expensive it definitely doesn't
look like it cost seven pounds but yeah
this is there I am definitely really
impressed with this one so I'm gonna
give it a thumbs up so the next item is
this faux fur jacket so this is kind of
like a crop jack here this is the
original photo of the listing I thought
this looks so cute or like a the person
in the photos isn't this gonna look the
same though that is the question
whoa-ohh actually feels quite soft okay
the lining literally the cheapest thing
I've ever seen but the outside oh yes I
think it's actually quite cute it looks
a lot like the photo I have to say
although in the photo you never feel the
line me now I have to say if you saw me
like this you think I'm quite snazzy
looking and this jackets quite bougie
but I mean when you look at the lining
it's like it screams I'm on a budget
it's like the cheapest fabric you
literally can get I don't even know how
to explain this it's kind of like the
cheapest like polyester or something I
have no clue so what he definitely could
rock this jacket if you just changed the
lining of it and I'm sure that's not
that expensive to do to be honest look
it's a really really cute from the
outside like the faux like fuzzy fur is
really really nice to the touch it's
super soft this jacket only cost me like
12 pounds which is actually a pretty
good price I feel like it looks a lot
like the photo it's really nice quality
so I haven't really got anything bad to
say about it apart from the lining okay
so this is the next item I add
for two of them by accident so that's
kind of annoying but I actually really
like this I think it's just like a
really nice plane a gray dress it
doesn't look a lot different from the
photo go this is the original picture of
the dress and obviously it looks a lot
more like ripped and textured in the
photo than it does in real life I mean
this is like slight ribbing to it but
not completely so I feel like it is
different from the picture but I really
like it it definitely hugs me in all the
right places so I'm gonna give this one
a thumbs up next two pieces that I have
to try on is this Bardot pink top and
also this skirt which is kind of like
those really popular on-trend lace-up
skirts I mean this looks tiny like am I
gonna fit this and yes or no okay so
first things first the top is literally
again the complete opposite color of
what it was in the photo it was nude but
I've got like a baby pink ripstop on so
I mean it's definitely not what I
ordered now the skirt feels really
really nice actually managed to get
myself into it which were very proud of
it's got a little zipper at the back
which is quite nice and I had to like
thread all of this up by myself which
took absolutely ages so please bear that
in mind if you ever ordered the skirt
but I don't like it it's not too bad
quality I feel like it looks really
really nice on it's definitely like
really nice and tight fitting which is
obviously what you want with a body con
skirt like this I have to say the top
does feel a little bit cheap like the
fabric isn't the nicest it's super super
thin and this is literally just this
it's like a rubber band so it's not the
nicest top over worn but at the end of
the day it was only four pounds and the
skirt was eight tough somebody together
and she looks pretty nice so I'm gonna
get this out there thumbs up now I have
another whatever this is to try it on I
can't even remember why I ordered I'm
pretty sure this is meant to be a top so
wish me luck okay I think I've got it
I'm pretty sure this is meant to wrap
around the back like so okay so the top
is on I feel like it's very very
see-through you definitely have to
a new color bra with this and also
probably a backless one because you can
definitely see my brush drop on the back
I really like the fact that it ties it
so nicely on the back honestly it's not
the worst quality it's definitely more
of like a summer top so this would be
really nice to just pop on on like a
Rudy hot summer's day cuz it's so breezy
it is very revealing right here so I'm
just gonna like hold it into place like
this but I really like it I think it's
really really pretty and I love the back
like the back is what made me buy it
because I really really love the fact
that it's got like a really nice big bow
at the back so this is the expectation
and this is the reality I feel like it's
pretty close to the photo so I haven't
really got anything too bad to say about
it so I'm gonna give this one a thumbs
up too okay so this is the next outfit
now I have to say right off the bat I am
hating this top so this top cost me six
pounds and I've mainly got it because I
really liked the back which is quite
nice to be fed but the quality is just
so so bad like in the photo right here
it just looks so nice and like oversized
and cue but this it barely reaches my
wrist so this definitely doesn't fit and
it's definitely not oversized as for the
bottoms I've been seeing these bottoms
all over the place and they look really
really nice and they laughed at the
stripe effect so these cost me eight
pounds they actually have like a little
faux pockets on the back which is quite
cute but I got them cuz I really liked
the stripe and they just looked really
nice on the bottom of like little heels
or something they're just really really
cute and kind of like casual look really
nice from a fine like the cut of them
and everything is pretty good but the
fabric that they used is kind of
annoying like it just doesn't feel very
nice on the skin but I mean I can't
really expect too much for a pound
before they don't look too bad but the
top I mean look at this picture it's
literally nothing like the picture next
up I have another pair of trousers and a
little a t-shirt to try on and this one
is so cool I mean you just look at this
top okay okay so are you guys ready for
this
I mean it's a cat that's secretly
putting his middle finger up for you the
whole time I'm done I'm very very
impressed with the t-shirt I really
really like her I'm definitely gonna be
wearing this a lot and just secretly
doing this to people all the time but
now let's focus on the trousers because
I feel like they are literally a
disaster they look really really nice
and I love the fair I love the fact that
it's got pockets but they just feel so
so cheap in fabric like worse than the
previous pair honestly I take everything
back about the previous bag because they
are nothing compared to this in person
they just feel really cheap like maybe
I'd wear these like in the summer
because the fabric is so thin because
it's so cheap but in my work who knows
but the top only cost me three pounds
which honestly just impresses me so much
because it is one of my favorite things
from this whole pool so that's the last
outfit now the last item I had is
actually a bikini to try on and this is
what the photo looks like I have no idea
how this is gonna look I haven't even
opened it yet but wish me luck
if you're not sure quite sturdy like the
actual cups of the top of the bikini
feels quite nice and then they love the
bottoms they look quite high-waisted
which I really like in bikinis so let's
try the so let's give it a go
and this is the bikini this is what it
looks like I feel like it's actually a
really cute design I'm just covering my
chest because it is quite boobie so what
I want to show you guys everything it
definitely isn't as high-waisted as I
thought this would be doesn't really
cover my belly bar to the top however
it's really nice but it doesn't really
have too much support like the strap
isn't very adjustable like by very I
mean it's not adjustable at all so you
can't really like adjusts it to your own
size and it's quite loose around like my
waist so I feel like this wouldn't be
the best bikini to be like wearing rosco
swimming or something but definitely
cool for sunbathing the bikini is
definitely made from like a decent
fabric so it's not like the cheapest
fabric you can get and it's not
see-through so I'm gonna give this one a
thumbs up although it is a bit annoying
that you can't really adjust it properly
okay so those are all over the wish
clothing items that I'm going to try out
for today
I am actually quite impressed with some
of them my favorite three was definitely
the dress the sequin one the cat top and
also the like lace-up scar I feel like
those were the best items out of
everything by far because a lot of the
other things just weren't exactly how
they were depicted in the photos or they
were just like slightly off or maybe the
quality just wasn't the best but at the
end of the day we have to bear in mind
that everything we bought was super
super cheap so we can't really expect it
to be amazing quality everybody hope you
guys enjoyed this video I'd found it
entertaining but also I hope that it
helped you in some way at least if you

another website that you'd like me to

comments also let me know which one of
these items was your favorite but that
