I just feel like a giant ruffle this is
very snug for dinner what's up guys
how's it going welcome back to my
channel so in today's video I am gonna
be testing out another one brand
clothing haul as you can tell from the
title today I'm gonna be testing out she
in know she in is a brand I have seen
all over the place I've seen so many
people do holes from that funny story I
actually remember she in before they
rebranded they used to be called it she
inside they actually got in contact with
me when I first started my channel like
three or four years ago and they offered
me some free clothes to do a lookbook in
this was honestly the first and brand
that ever reached out to me which is
kind of special to me because I remember
receiving like a bunch of free clothes
and although they weren't really the
best quality I was kind of over the moon
about it I win this video I kind of
wanted to see if they improve the
quality of their clothes so I went and
spend three hundred pounds on this
website I know I honestly don't know why
I keep spending money but I did this for
the purpose of this video so don't judge
me so this is the books that everything
came in it's quite a hefty and heavy box
I have to say oh the shipping for this
probably was around two weeks it as she
was a longer than what I expected
because on the website it said I think
maybe between five to seven days that
everything would arrive in if you guys
are new here make sure you come and join
the dinosaur family by subscribing down
below you know you want to and also
don't forget to click the notification
bar button to stay notified of every
time I post a new video because YouTube
messes up a lot but anyways without
further ado let's get on into the video
okay so here I have the first item that
I'm going to be testing out now this is
kind of like a two piece set this cost
me twelve pounds forty and honestly I've
been seeing this like advertised on
Instagram all sorts of different social
media so I just have to get this and I
love the print
I'm just hoping this isn't gonna be too
short for me so let's try it on and see
how it looks
oh my god I love
in love with this look how cute that
looks this is just so summery and if she
fits perfectly it's not too sure I
actually thought this would be a little
bit short and a little bit too tight but
honestly it fits like a glove I actually
love this little place that I have to
say the material feels a little bit
unlike the cheaper side but it honestly
doesn't look at all like one camera as
I'm looking at it now it just looks
really really good it's very like
lightweight so this would be perfect for
like a really hot summer's holiday I'm
gonna give this one a thumbs up and now
the next outfit I'm gonna try on is this
so the first thing I have is this little
top which looks like this it's very very
cute it's very dainty and like an artist
really liked it and then I also picked
up these pants which are kind of daring
I have to say when I saw this on the
website it doesn't he looked out there
but I didn't think it would be as out
there as it does in person I honestly
don't know if I'm going to be able to
pull these off but let's try it on and
see okay in my mind I thought this was
gonna look so cute but this is just what
it looks like I feel like the top is
quite curious a little bit on the loose
side this bit here should have been a
little bit more like secure but these
treehouses
don't even get me started I love trying
new things that I usually wouldn't wear
but this is just a little bit too far I
think however I can do this which is
quite fun they're very funky but I just
feel like a giant ruffled okay so this
is the next outfit and I just thought
I'd show you guys I'll try to put this
on because this button will literally
not go through the whole like the seam
of the button of like the actual denim
is so small that the button just won't
even fit which is really quite annoying
because I can't do this up it literally
just worn even fit for so these don't
worry it cost me 16 pounds if I remember
correctly and the top is actually just
like a little ribbed white crop top
which is I think six pounds this is
literally so painful I thumb hurts okay
oh this is very snug I'm not gonna lie
these dungarees are kind of giving me a
little bit of a wedgie
but we're just gonna
Oh oh no way oh my god this little thing
that holds this like metal part together
has just popped off what that and now
the point is it holds the button in
place it just comes straight off like
that it's literally so annoying cuz
these donkeys are so cute I'm gonna have
to send this back unfortunately because
I literally can't even fix there and
it's such a shame cuz I really like
these dungarees and they actually fit me
quite well apart from the fact that I'm
getting a wedgie also before we go any
further I just wanna clarify that I
actually just realized that I'm missing
some pieces from she inside and I feel
like they're probably gonna come right
after I filmed this video which is so
annoying I think they probably shipped
out in a separate parcel but I'll still
link the things that I picked up from
she inside that having arrived in the
description in case you guys want to
check it out this is the next outfit and
I am actually living for this table I
love the color I think it's so like
summery and it's just such a nice
quality I really like it it's very like
breathable now this top only cost me 13
pounds which I feel like it's such a
good price for a top like of this
quality and the shows loves me 10 pounds
I honestly don't really know how I feel
about the shorts I feel like they kind
of look like I'm wearing a nappy a
little bit you guys see what I'm saying
I really like how they looked on the
hanger but now that I'm very live I'm
not so sure if I actually like though
they're definitely very like oversized
kind of like mom jeans or boyfriend
jeans sort of style perhaps I should
have gotten a smaller size to make it a
little bit more fitted to my body but I
feel like they just look a little bit
too big on me what do you guys think
however the outfit is not a complete
disaster I am loving the top of the
shorts they're okay they're not the best
but I still don't like them so I'm going
to give them a thumbs up now this next
item that I have is quite an interesting
little piece because basically it has a
little like crop top which is just plain
white but then it also has this flannel
shirt that is meant to kind of go over
like so this look quick you online so
guys why I picked it up but let's go try
it on and see how it looks so this is
what it looks like on honestly I
actually quite like you I think it looks
quite cute I do feel like this is
something you could definitely see and
like pretty little thing or something
but yeah I feel like it's quite a nice
fit like for once the sleeves aren't too
long for me it's actually surprisingly
good quality because it only cost me 10
pounds so that's quite a bargain for a
top like this I kind of tied it up a
little bit but this is what it looks
like when it's untied it kind of just
doesn't really sit properly so I feel
like when you tie it up it looks a lot
better so yeah I'm gonna give this one a
thumbs up so I feel like it looks quite
cute the next two minutes I'm gonna try
out some denim pieces now you guys know
from my previous video that I am
obsessed with denim at the moment so
when I saw this I just needed it so the
jeans are kind of like a boyfriend sort
of style and they have like a little
pulse all over them which is kind of
what attracted me to them and the jacket
is pretty much the same it has lots of
like little powers and little beads on
it which it's just the cutest so let's
try it on and see how it looks so this
is the outer and what it looks like on I
kind of am obsessed with it I mother'll
either Jack here I feel like he's a
little bit much like it's kind of long
which I don't really like denim jackets
from the long I definitely liked them
lil bit more crop but I do really like
the detail I think is very very pretty
the quality is quite nice too and I also
just paired it with this little top that
I've also got from a sheet in this part
of the crops up here is very nicely
fitted which I definitely really
appreciate and as for the jeans I
absolutely love the PO detail and it's
such a quirky little design and I feel
like it definitely adds a little bit
more to like your regular pair of gsre
the jacket was 25 pounds of the jeans
worth 14 pounds I believe and the top
was like five or so pounds so again this
outfit is so affordable like I love how
affordable everything is on this website
so far but yes this is the outfit it's a
little bit daring cuz it's like denim on
denim I have to say I'm not really
feeling the jacket too much so I'm going
to give that one a thumbs down but as
for everything else I feel like it looks
really cute the next thing I'm gonna try
out is this little jumper and oh my god
I love this so much
I've seen this jumper advertised
everywhere and obviously this is like
one of their main bestsellers orgy
inside so I really wanted to give this a
go and try it on so this cost me roughly
11 pounds we're just so affordable for a
jumper like this it's very nice and like
high-neck I am kind of loving this
jumper honestly I really like the
pattern I think it's so pretty it's such
a wearable color too and it's very much
interesting the only thing I have to say
is that these sleeves are a little bit
too sure I would have much rather prefer
they were like this sort of length but I
mean it's not the end of the what I mean
if you roll up the sleeves and kind of
make it look like they were supposed to
be a little bit shorter I'm sure you
could get away with it even if you tuck
it in a little bit I think it just
looked really cute and relaxed and I'm
actually really really loving the
quality so I'm gonna give this one a
thumbs up the next item is this little
jacket which I absolutely love the color
ah it's so so cute am I not going the
best with this outfit but let's ignore
that so this cost me 13 pounds and the
reason why I really liked it is because
it says I'm a not weird I'm limited
edition on the back I don't know if you
guys will be able to see that I mainly
picked up this jacket because I really
like the fact that it's cropped and it
just looks like it's fitted super well
too high-waisted jeans such as these I
don't really have anything bad to say
about it so I'm gonna give this one a
thumbs up I think it's really cute okay
so these are the next item I'm gonna be
trying on so this is essentially the
black version of the top I'm currently
wearing which I already really liked so
I'm gonna see how I get along with this
and to go to the crop top I have at this
campus court which if you guys don't
know what a score is is basically shorts
and a skirt in one and it had like this
really nice lace-up design on the
left-hand side but I have to say this
was kind of small so I don't know if
it's gonna fit me but let's try it on
and see so this is what the outfit looks
like on I have to admit this squat was
kind of a struggle to pull over my hip
so that one's it on ya actually fits
quite well black version at the top that
I was previously wearing is actually
quite nice the only thing I have to say
it's not as a tight fitting around at
this sort of area so if you wanted to
wear this without a bra I don't think
you could because it's not very
supportive but it's still really nice so
the top was five pounds and the score
two worth eight pounds I think I would
definitely recommend these two pieces
because they're so affordable and I feel
like you can't really go wrong with them
and I love the fact that this is
actually shorts underneath the skirt
because a lot of the time I end up not
wearing skirts because I'm too scared
that they were like fly up or I'm quite
restricted to my movement but with this
I feel really secure and I know for a
fact that I'm not gonna have my bow bow
and flash people they I give both of the
items a big thumbs now the next item
is this pair of like yoga slash jogger
pans what I saw this I thought to myself
this definitely is not the most
fashionable thing I've never seen but
I'd really wanted to try these because I
felt like it would be really comfortable
okay so these are probably the biggest
nono out of this whole pool so first of
all we could see my underwear which I
know I could probably wear higher
underwear that's fine but I just feel
like this layer is just too much like
literally I'll lift my leg up and you
can almost see my bum I mean I kind of
get where they were going through this
but come on like why is that yeah well
they're very like roomy I just feel like
I'm gonna have to give them a pass so
this is the next item it's another pair
of jokers now I have to say where does
the lead on the website they look quite
cool I feel like they were quite
interesting because they're definitely
really different from any joggers I have
seen out there because I don't have you
guys can see on camera but they have
like a mesh sort of effect of them
they're like almost see-through but it's
just like the whole thing is made out of
mesh
apart from this little thing here I feel
like they would have been really really
cool if the whole thing was mesh and
then you had maybe like I don't know I'm
not short but maybe like a bikini sort
of style underneath but the shorts just
look a little bit weak I totally get
that you have to have something to you
know cover your underwear you definitely
don't want your underwear I'm sure but I
feel like they could have made like a
nicer thing to go underneath these to
make them look a little bit better there
should look quite nice there I really
like them from the bottom half down
because they're very interesting and I
feel like that would have looked really
nice with like a nice pair of trainers
so I'm not really digging this half
right here because I feel like it just
doesn't really look that good so these
cost me about 11 pounds I feel like
that's a really good price for job is
and I mean essentially you'll pay for
the netting so I would be kind of
surprised if it was a lot more than what
I paid for the necks out that I have
it's a little bit more dressy a little
bit more appropriate for going out so
the first thing is that this little top
right here which I absolutely love these
colors it's definitely not something I
would usually breach full bar I really
liked it and then I just got a pair of
these high-waisted black like buttons
travelers to go along with those and
this is the next outfit I actually
really like this I mean I love how it
looks from afar like I love the top love
the colors I feel like it's such a
dressy outfit I have to say with these
two things in particular the quality
isn't really that great we did only pay
nine pounds for the top and around
eleven pounds for the bottom I really
love the top but I just feel like it's
very lightweight and like the fabric
just feels a bit like itchy and scratchy
on my skin another thing that kind of
ruins it for me is this little button
right here it's just so unnecessary and
you can kind of see it which just
doesn't really look that great I'm
actually quite disappointed because I
really love this top I love the trousers
as well I feel like they fit so nicely
and I mean yeah overall the outfit from
afar looks great but when you look up
close it's just not the best quality the
next outfit is a little bit more casual
a little bit more wearable every day so
I just have a pair of ripped jeans and
this little jumper right here so let's
go put it off so this is the next outfit
I feel like it doesn't actually go as
well together as I thought it did when I
was buying it online so let's just
ignore that and judge them separately I
honestly love this jumper it feels so
soft and the Smiths are like slightly
bell sleeves which isn't too much like
I'm not really a fan of bell sleeves but
this is like the perfect amount and the
jeans fit so nicely they look really
good they fit really well the rips I
mean and they kind of a bit too much for
me that's just a personal preference but
they definitely looked as they did in
the photo so that's good so both of
these items are really great quality I
would definitely recommend them and I
love this this will like detail on the
side of this jump I think it's really
cool and the very last item I have to
try out is this jumper right here you
guys might recognize it because it's
literally been everywhere this is the
one item that she in promotor literally
anywhere they can and I really love the
like zipper effect on the actual sleeve
which is really cool so this is what the
jumper looks like on I've honestly been
eyeing up this jumper for like a year
like I've seen this so many times on
I never really got around to picking it
up although I really liked it in the
pictures John Paul was a tiny bit
pricier with 17 pounds which is probably
one of the most expensive things I
actually ordered from the school but I
really feel like it's kind of worth it I
haven't really seen too many jumpers
like this on the house drew with like
little zippers on the sleeves so yeah
I'm gonna give her this jumper a big
thumbs up as well so that was everything
I have bought from she inside I honestly
am very surprised to everything I feel
like the quality has definitely improved
a lot since I first kind of got to know
she inside back when I started my
channel there was definitely some hit
and miss pieces with this hole but I
feel like overall I kind of liked most
of the pieces everything is so
affordable in this website as well which
is another reason why I really liked her
and really wanted to test everything out
so let me know what you guys thought of
these craving pieces I'll have all the
links down below in case you want to try
out any of them for yourself also be
sure to let me know what other website
you would like me to try out neck I feel
like I kind of want to do romwe and then
maybe like saffle or something so do let
me know in the comments what you would
like to see next but that is all from me
thank you so much for watching and I
hope to see you guys in my next video
