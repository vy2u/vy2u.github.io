someone's help to actually surgically
remove this off my body the bulletin
just came off no I kind of just feel
like a big hot air balloon in this this
is the look this is the look I have done
it yet again what is up guys and welcome
back to my channel so in today's video
as you can see by the title I have spent
400 pounds baby why do I keep doing this
my bank account is crying right now I
have one bag and - okay yeah this is a
bit too much now for today's video I
thought I would do another I spent sort
of video to kind of add to my little
series if you guys haven't been keeping
up with the playlist of all these videos
that I've done so far I'll have a little
playlist down below as well as in the
corner here I've tested all sorts of
brands like a sauce fashion of a pretty
little thing she in wish clothing as
well so yeah there's a little mix of
everything in this and make sure you
guys check those out as well but for
today's video i'm of course testing our
boo clothing now i have picked up a few
things from boo who in the past and they
were kind of like either a hit or miss
sometimes so i thought this would be a
really fun video and especially because
zendaya has actually released her own
like clothing brand in collaboration
with me who i was actually able to pick
up a few pieces from the sunday idea to
basically show you guys and let you know
what i think about it or before
everything completely sold out so i'm
really excited i get to show you guys
those pieces as well by the way if you
guys don't follow me on my Instagram and
Twitter make sure you do I am always so
interactive with you guys on there so if
you guys don't follow me yet make sure
you check it out and we can have a
little chat but anyways I'm gonna stop
rambling and we can get on into the
video okay so here I have the first two
agents we're gonna be trying on so these
are both from the zendaya and so here I
have the suit trousers which cost 25
pounds and the supe laser would cost 30
if you like this color is it so gorgeous
I don't usually wear like anything but I
think it's gonna be so big in the spring
so I thought pick it up and try it on so
let's just see how it look
this is outfit number one I am actually
really digging this color I think it's
so like spring appropriate I think it's
gonna be so huge this year as well and
yeah I just don't really wear much lilac
like it's just not really a color that I
reach towards but I am really really
liking this the fabric of the whole suit
is really nice like it feels really well
made and it's quite soft and the only
thing I would have to say about the
trousers is that the pockets are quite
shallow so it's not like you can just
you know put anything in there ready
like you couldn't put your phone in or
anything oh it does have a back pocket
as well but I just don't think it would
fit your phone they're quite shallow
pockets however if you do get the blazer
these have pretty deep pockets so and
you're all good on that front
I am always wearing the exact same
outfit as zendaya I am wearing a
slightly different white top than her I
mean this one is a little bit weird it's
got like a cutout on each side I'm cool
from the side but from the front it just
looks kind of weird I don't know what do
you guys think in terms of the price I
feel like it's quite a decent price I
mean for suits like especially for women
this is the kind of price you get on
High Street for you know office wear and
stuff like that anyways yeah I think I
drool I'm gonna give this one a big
thumbs up now for the next zendaya
outfit we have the iconic striped shorts
when I saw these on the website was like
I need these in my line and then I've
just got like a little white crop top to
pair with this so let's try it on and
see how it looks I honestly am in love
with these shores look how cool they are
they are so well fitted like the
waistband is super cinched in at the
waist which I absolutely love
but let's talk about this tie situation
in the front I mean in the photos it
looks really cool it looks really edgy
and like sassy but I mean let's talk
practical way when I'm walking around I
can kind of see you getting in my way
and getting a little bit irritating you
could also at the end of the day tie it
into a bow but I probably wouldn't
recommend that cuz I mean it doesn't
look some over weird but no overall I am
really digging this out for like for
summer I just think this would be so
cute if you're wondering it
these are shorts cost me 15 pounds so
everybody it's quite a reasonable price
although it has got like a celebrity
collaboration going on I don't think
they're taken advantage of their
customers which is really good because
everything is kind of decently priced
like as any other item on boohoo so I
really appreciate that it's not breaking
my bank completely I'm gonna give these
a thumbs up I don't quite like them
although I'm still a little bit unsure
about this like wrap run the next item
we're gonna try on is this little
checkered bodycon skirt so this cost me
eight pounds surprisingly this guy is so
cute oh my god it's giving me such
clueless vibes I absolutely love it it
fits really nicely like around the waist
it's very like stretchy it fits
literature like a glove it's like
hugging me in all the right places which
is really nice and the fact that it was
eight pounds is also really good because
obviously we don't want to be spending
too much money on a skirt do we now I'm
gonna give this one a big thumbs up ever
since watching the clueless movie I've
been searching for a perfect skirt like
this all my life this is the zendaya
Edea ruffle dress which costs 35 pounds
and it looks amazing on her now I have
to say I personally don't really like
maxi dresses myself but I've got this
cousin of gorgeous one zendaya and it
kind of look quite wearable although
it's quite a long dress as you can see
it's got a lot of ruffles I just think I
don't know I kind of just feel like a
big hot air balloon in this it looks so
good on her and I'm so gutted that I
just don't really like it because it is
like a really nice dress I love the
pattern I love the fact that it's like a
silky fabric as well but the concept of
it is really cool like I love all the
ruffles and the pinstripe is obviously
quite on trend and it's quite a theme
going throughout her edit but just don't
know I just really like it let me know
what you guys think do you think this
looks good do you actually like this
dress I kind of just boy on a win
because it looks so nice on her but I
guess that's just you know marketing at
its finest it got me to buy it but do I
actually like here I don't think so I'm
probably gonna send this back the next
outfit I'm gonna try on is this no cord
which is like a yellow bandeau top and a
yellow high-waisted skirt that looks
like that this is also from the zendaya
edit I am kind of disappointed with this
one because the bando top is so tight
like literally it's so restrictive I can
barely breathe now I have to say this is
a size 8 which usually fits me perfectly
fine with the bottom half no problems at
all however this part here I mean look
you can see my bra like from underneath
I had to pull it a little bit higher
otherwise I literally would be like
edging out the top I love this so much I
love the color I think it's such a cute
outfit but I'm just so gutted that this
top half is just not really true to size
which kind of sucks but oh well I still
really like the outfit though I
definitely give it a thumbs up but make
sure you just maybe size up with the top
half this outfit is so cute oh the
button just came off no why that's so
annoying this outfit was gonna be so
cute I'm gonna do the zip up okay you
can't tell that there's no button but it
might just pop open at any point but
anyways this is the next outfit I'm so
good about this button right here but
it's still really cute I love love these
trousers I never usually wear red on my
bottom half like I've been wearing like
red tops quite a lot recently I feel
like it's such an underrated color a lot
of the time so I thought I would give
these red trousers ago now they have
this like really cool lace-up design
however they don't show your skin which
is really good so I never have to worry
about like my knickers showing through
like in the previous videos and the top
half is just like a bandeau top very
simple I just thought it would
complement these trousers quite well I
am really liking these I'm slow got to
that the bottom fell off I'm gonna have
to send these back and get a new pair
the next item is this dress right here
so this is my clique jumper dress this
is called the nadine chevron color-block
sweat dress this is again in a size 8 so
I'm hoping it's not going to be too like
chunky so let's try it off and this is
what it looks like I am absolutely
loving this I think it's such a nice try
additional piece into like spring
because it's got like the spring colors
but it's got the warmth for like winters
it's like the perfect length as well I
don't think it's too sure and I don't
think it's too long either so I
definitely would recommend this if you
guys are looking for a really nice like
jumper dress
this was also quite fairly priced I
think so this is definitely a winner for
me I'm gonna give this one a thumbs up
now the next two things we're gonna try
on are these are gorgeous little shorts
from boohoo and also this little bandeau
top which is just giving me such Tommy
Hilfiger vibe so this is what the outfit
looks like on I'm actually really loving
and the pieces separately but not
necessarily together
I love the crop top but I feel like
these shorts are just a little low
waisted like obviously they are high
waisted but I think they should have
been a little bit more taller to make it
work with this top but obviously and
that's not the items fault at all I love
the fact that it's got like a super
elasticated waist band
however this pie here should have been a
little bit more elasticated as well I
think because it's just a little bit
loose and ill-fitted which is kind of
annoying cuz I do really like this top
and I would have kept it if it wasn't
for the fact that it's quite loose on
top but either ways I'm absolutely
loving the look of both of them I
probably will send the top back but the
shorts are really really nice they fit
super well since the next item I'm gonna
try on and I am actually loving it again
I probably would have preferred
something a little bit more high-waisted
to wear with this kind of top as it is
quite cropped but I love the actual
texture of it the fabric is super soft
and I love the look of it the neckline
is really cool as well because it's got
like a stripe going through it I am
absolutely loving this top as like
standalone piece probably just know were
these shorts and I also have another
crop top to try on and I think it
actually might look ok with these shorts
so this is like a little a nude crop top
with a little crossover detail I'm not
very good at explaining so let's try it
on and you'll see what I mean so this is
what the next top looks like I have to
say this wasn't so hard to actually get
on because you have to get like this
strap over your head first and then the
rest of the top but this pie here was so
tied that it wouldn't go over my
shoulders or my chest so I was like a
struggling trying to get into it
but I am now in so it so good an action
quite like here I think this top
definitely goes a lot better with this
shorts as obviously there's not that
much of a gap in between the two items
of clothing now it's quite a simple
cropped Armour but I really love the
detail with the crossover I think it's
really just you know a little bit
different and adds a little bit of sass
to the outfit so I'm gonna give this one
a thumbs up as well right now how am I
actually gonna get this off I might need
someone's help to actually surgically
remove this off my body
this next meal is kind of different to
anything from this haul because this is
a thing that I've never actually seen
anywhere to be honest it's basically
like a cord
two piece set but it's like jogger style
like the skirt and the jumper are both
made out of like a fleecy sort of
material that like you know lounge sets
are made out of yeah I've never seen a
jogger skirt got like the waistband of a
jogger the fabric of joggers but it's a
sky it's so weird but he's quite cool I
feel quite badass wearing this and it
also does have a hood which is pretty
cool I don't know if I can pull this off
it's just I'm just I don't think I'm
cool enough really next up I have
another dress so this is kind of like a
ribbed body Conner dress with a choker
detail you guys know I love my ripped
and anything choker really so let's try
this on and see what we think I am
totally digging this dress this was only
12 pounds would you even believe that
this is so nicely fitted to my body it's
not like see-through or anything so I'm
really liking it it's not like scratchy
like some fabrics like this can kind of
feel a little bit like irritating on the
skin quite a comfortable dress to wear I
would say so yeah I'm gonna give this
one a big thumbs up I mean for 12 pounds
you can't really go wrong now I have a
slightly more daring item to try on so
this is another item from the zendaya
edit this is kind of a little bit more
on the pricey side because it was 45
pounds but for a jacket I feel like
that's kind of a standard price so this
is like a metallic sort of color which I
well you guys know I never wear anything
like this so I you know I have no idea
if this is even gonna go with this dress
but let's break some
boundaries today okay so initial
thoughts I feel like I'm kind of wearing
my tinfoil drapped
lunch yeah I don't know I just I never
get along with jackets like this they're
just so strange like this sort of fabric
is just not meant to be warm obviously
if you like this kind of jacket then
totally go for it I just am speaking for
my personal opinion I probably wouldn't
wear this out just because it just it
sounds and feels uncomfortable like I
don't want to be wearing tin foil around
Bolivar I do understand fashion like it
is quite edgy to wear things that are
quite out there like this so you know
I'm not hating it's just not really my
cup of tea I'm gonna give the gold
jacket a pass I'm sorry zendaya now for
the next outfit I have this a black crop
top with another like crossover thing
I'm hoping I'm gonna be able to get out
of this and then it to go with that I've
just got this like simple denim sort of
red skirt again with the red I am just
so obsessed with red at the moment this
fabric oh my god I literally can't even
get it on my arm it kind of feels like
wetsuit sort of fabric and it's so tight
how am I ever gonna get this on let
alone off no this isn't happening this
is so tall I think I've got like
dislocate my shoulder to be able to get
into this top oh my word this is pure
pain I actually can't get in okay so
update this is as far as I can go this
is the look this is the look Real Talk
though this is a size oh yeah this is
this is the top ah crap I'll go get it
off now so I'll see you guys in like
five hours and this is the very last
item that I'm gonna try on today it
feels so nice to actually put on
something that actually fits like
honestly my body is hurting from that
previous top but let's talk about this
dress I am loving it it's so like spring
and summer it's so flowy I love the
pattern and I love the detail it's kind
of got like a lace detail right here and
I love that the sleeves are so like
poofy and cute I kind of just feel like
Snow White or something in this dress
the fabric is so nice it's super soft
and at this fits really true to size as
well so I'm gonna give this one at
thumbs
so that is it that is all of the booboo
clothing it that I'm gonna try out for
you guys today I actually felt like
there was a good mix of everything in
there I actually quite enjoyed the
zendaya edit I think that some of the
pieces were a little bit like not really
my personal style but I still think
they're really cool the quality was gray
yeah I can't really fault him as you
guys know from these videos already
there's always gonna be some pieces of
clothing there I just like a complete
nono so I kind of pick out those things
from the websites as well just to see if
I can pull them off or not but not gonna
lie a lot of the times I cannot pull it
off so don't judge I really hope you
