let's hide away from the world just me
or does this coke kind of look like a
mattress and superwoman I can't be
honest who are a better me or this tin
foil wraps Chipotle burrito literally
just popped open by itself
oops I did it again
I spent some money how's it going guys
welcome back to my channel so today I am
doing yet another I spent sort of video
I've done two of these already on my
channel and you guys really seem to be
enjoying them I've done fashion over and
also a sauce if you guys haven't checked
this out yet make sure you click the eye
right there
but today's video is all about pretty
little thing now I have kind of like a
love-hate relationship with pretty
little thing I know shop on there often
but whenever I do on that rare occasion
I literally have zero control like
absolute zilch end up spending so much
money just the way I did for this video
I'm not proud I'm not proud but I do
have to say I did spend like five
hundred and eighty pounds on this
website
who even am I literally I have like five
of these huge bags to test out for you
guys now I've seen a few comments on my
previous videos where I spend like a lot
of money on clothes and I just want to
clarify that I don't actually keep like
any of these I mean I keep like some bit
but most of it goes back unless it's the
fashion Nova video literally I will
probably do another fashion over video
and I'll tell you guys about the returns
because it was literally a disaster but
I just wanted to spend like a lot more
money than I usually would because I
really want to test out these products
and get as many as I can to really give
you guys an opinion off the store if you
guys are brand new make sure you come
and join the dinosaur family I would
love to have you here and also don't
forget to click the notification bow
down below just to stay notified of
every time I post a new video but if you
guys want to see if a pretty little
thing is actually worth the hype then
let's get on into the video eight
this is the first outfit now honestly I
have to say when I put this on I was
actually really pleasantly surprised
because I honestly don't feel like these
sort of pants I like a staple piece for
my wardrobe in any shape or form so I
didn't really know if I would like them
or not
but I actually I'm really liking this
outfit though the camo jogger is aware I
think 20 pounds and the little crop top
was 12 so I feel like this is a pretty
affordable outfit and the quality is
really good I really am impressed with
it actually joggers fit really well
they're also a little bit high-waisted
so they're perfect to wear with a crop
top so I feel like we're off to a pretty
good start with this outfit and I'm kind
of getting like instagrams baddie vibes
with this so the net oh my god this top
literally has just popped open what the
hell oh my god if this popped open like
in public that would be so embarrassing
so I'm not wearing a bra right now but
it literally just popped open by itself
unless you can't even do this up by
myself guys why is this such a struggle
okay so I'm kind of changed my mind on
this top now because I mean I just tried
to get it back home and it's just
constantly unzipping itself so easily
literally it's already coming undone can
you guys see that it's so easy to just
take this off like what the hell I'm
actually sending this a straight back
because ain't nobody want some boot
slippage in public this dress is popping
look at those guys I honestly really
really like it the only thing I would
say is that English she has no support
in like the boob area so you definitely
need to wear like a strapless bra or
something yeah I really like it it's
definitely giving me some curves it's
definitely like hugging me and cinching
me in all the right places which is
definitely good oh this dress works at
30 pounds which is a little bit pricey
but I feel like for a dress of this sort
of standards it's actually really nice
it's a really good fit I got this in a
size 8 and it's very true to size so I
definitely give this dress a thumbs up I
really really like it but the next
outfit we're gonna move on to is this
one right here so I've got a pair of
jeans which are kind of like lace-up on
the side I think and then I also have
one of these like iconic top so let's
try these on and see how they look oh
this our way
kayuu I mean apart from this bit right
here okay so I love trousers like this
but I kind of just sometimes feel like
what am I meant to do about my underwear
like what is the secret not show your
underwear through these little slits
like it looks so cool and yes I am
probably gonna get very cold if I wore
these outside you wear like very thin
underwear or something so you only have
like one thin bit of underwear showing
us where bloggers wear these all the
time and they don't have any underwear
on so are you just not meant to wear
underwear with these trousers I don't
know what is the secret guys just just
tell me if you know rest of the outfit
that's pretty good just let's cover
these bits apart from that I really like
the top it's very oversized but it fits
really nicely the only thing I have to
say is that there's a loose thread
hanging from the sleeves it's not a big
deal I'm just gonna cut it off the
trouser though I honestly don't know how
I feel about them there were 28 pounds
which is quite expensive for trousers
that I might not even be able to wear
because my underwear they also have this
weird excess fabric right here which
makes my like privates just look rumor
anyway I don't know if these jeans are
for me but the top is definitely really
cute I'm gonna give that one a thumbs up
okay so this next item bear with me you
guys is this yellow coat now this is
kind of like a shaggy sort of coat
I kind of thought you looked cute on the
model and I thought you looked like you
know edgy or something but I got this
and I want to seem not sure how this is
gonna look but this was 45 pounds so we
will see okay and in that moment I
became a rug I mean I don't know how I
feel about this from a distance I
thought I feel this kind of cute but up
close as I'm looking at it I just
literally feel like a carpet slash a rug
that should just be on the living room
floor I mean it looked amazing on the
door but on me I just feel like I can't
pull this off I really can't although it
has lots of movements so it's very fun
to like dance around in it I mean I
don't know I feel like it's just too
cool for me like I can't pull this off
I'm kind of on the verge of liking it
and
really not like yet and I just kind of
don't know which one I am
ah I wouldn't know your thoughts down
below on this jacket like would you buy
this would you wear this I want to know
I've then also got this lovely jumper
that I'm gonna try on next this is just
like her oversized jumper I believe it
just says California on it
so let's try it on and see how it fit
but I need to take my rug off this -
it's pretty snug like it's really really
nice it's fleece lined on the inside so
it's definitely gonna keep you warm this
was only 15 pounds you guys I mean for a
really nice quality jumper I feel like
that's not a lot to pay and this is like
a really nice size - because I got this
in a size s I honestly felt like you
would be a little bit too small but it's
actually oversized like it claims on the
website so I definitely would recommend
to go for your size rather than going
the next size up with this one now next
up I have something a little bit more
daring so this is like a jumpsuit with a
slit in the leg so I'm really kind of
nervous to try this because I have no
idea if it's gonna suit me but we're
gonna give it a shot
wowza that is that is something that is
I'm deysi by is a date night outfit
right there I just have no idea about
the slit in the leg whoa it goes all the
way up to like the hip I mean I don't
think this is the look like my underwear
is definitely not meant to be on show I
mean really what are you meant to do
about this underwear situation I'll just
be like out on my deck for Valentine's
Day and up underwear slip it's such a
shame cuz I really really like this
outfit like I think it would have been
so nice if this was just a little bit
lower because the slip literally goes to
my hip bone which is just way too much
for me if I do this it makes it look
like a one-piece jumpsuit and then this
is my cape
and superwoman I honestly feel like I
should title this video exposing my
underwear I mean I have a trend going on
here
for another pair of these trousers with
the lace-up because I really wanted to
just give them a go see if I suit them I
mean I've seen a bunch of bloggers
wearing trousers like this and I just
just can't I just can't deal with it so
surely you can't really cover to these
now on the top half I am wearing a stay
weird top which is actually a dress but
I've rolled up and kind of tie it into a
knot I really like this it gives me such
like stranger things vibes if you guys
watch stranger things and give this
video a thumbs up and also let me know
down below what shows you watch from
that place because I am always on the
lookout for new shows so the dress was
at 15 pounds and the trousers were 25 I
feel like it's quite an affordable price
for a top and to be fair it is a dress
and let me just show you guys quickly
what it looks like as a dress it's quite
long and so you could wear it with like
some nice thigh high boots or something
and that would be a really cute outfit
too overall I really like the outfit and
definitely the top is my favorite part
and the trousers are going straight back
the next item we're gonna be trying out
is this one right here it's like a
bright silver puffer jacket so wish me
like wear this on I can't be honest who
wore a better me or there's tin foil
wraps Chipotle burrito and weirdly
enough this actually smells of food
here's what I mean it's not really my
vibe I can't I just can't live with this
I really wanted to give it a go I wanted
to like get something a little bit out
there you know out of my comfort zone
but this just doesn't really do it for
me and this was 40 pounds as well I mean
it's kind of cute actually it's kind of
cute off the shoulders but that's not
how you meant to wear a jacket this is
next we have this little pretty little
thing own it's set so this is like a
brawl and this is like a legging so I'm
pretty sure this is meant for like
working out but I probably would use
this for like more lounging around
because I mean exercise or extra fries
come on oh my god I have matched you
really liking it I think it looks really
really good it definitely feels really
nice in quality it fits really really
well the sports bra feels like it's got
quite a lot of support too so I am
giving this one up tons
now I have another like loungy set just
cuz I couldn't help myself and again
it's in a nude color daddy on this thing
that she really read you I really like
it so the top half is 18 pounds and the
bottom half is 20 pounds now here's a
little bit pricey for like a jogger sad
but honestly it fits so well and this
would the perfect lounge set for like
when you want to be a slob but you want
to be a cute slow we don't have to worry
about the outfits and like picking
things now this is this is all you need
it's just so so nice and I love the
color I'm definitely keeping this little
sad now excuse me if this color doesn't
match up this outfit I'm just gonna try
on at this puffer jacket by honest II
don't even remember buying it so it's
kind of like a big big long jacket oh
with a hood and it's nude so let's give
it a shot this was a sixty pound man
that is quite pricey I love the look of
these puffer coats but I always feel
like I'm just a big bin bag in bonus it
looks like I'm so ready to go camping
right now let's hide away from the world
right you got it out ready for this
candle mode engage literally look at me
right now they're just me or does this
coat kind of look like a mattress /
freedom I think I'm gonna give this cup
no I mean I love it for campaign but for
like fashion purposes probably a no from
me this next dress is at 25 pounds now I
honestly thought that you could adjust
this little like Russia in the middle I
was sadly mistaken
so now I have to kind of sacrifice
between either my chest area being
exposed or my crotch area being exposed
now that's a sacrifice I definitely
don't want to have to make with this
dress so I'm kind of just gonna do this
and it just doesn't move okay I thought
I could make do with this dress because
I really really like here but it's just
a bit too revealing especially because
you can't adjust this now if someone had
a longer torso than me this pot here
would list should be up to their belly
button and I just feel like that's a
look you definitely don't want to go for
I'm gonna give this dress a thumbs down
my excites I'm gonna try on is another
dress so this is like something very out
of my comfort zone I usually wouldn't go
for this color it's like a very dark
green color so let's put it on and see
how it looks so this is what it looks
like on honestly I don't really know how
I feel about it I feel like I should
have gotten a size down and it only
managed to get this in a size 10 whereas
I'm a size 8 so I feel like it would
have fit a lot better like around the
waist and around the chest area if it
was a size 8 but apart from that I feel
like it's a really nice dress it's
definitely a really appropriate for like
going out which I definitely don't do a
lot of it is quite pricey for a dress I
mean you're probably not gonna get that
much she's out of this it's definitely
more for like special occasions but I
still think it's very cute and the
quality is definitely really good so I'm
gonna give this one a thumbs up but I
haven't yet another round set honestly
presidential thing have so many like
loungy sets to choose from but I
definitely didn't have a problem picking
it yet another one this is definitely
really comfortable it's got a little bit
of style because it's got the cutout on
the chest and it's got a little hood
which is quite nice now yes again I have
another puffer coat to try out this
isn't like a really nice silver color
and I feel like it will go quite well
with this outfit okay okay I'm kind of
having flashbacks to my a CIL's video
with that weird white jacket what the
heck was that and what the hell is why
why would you do this to a car like
what's the point having that cinched in
bit it really doesn't look that good so
this was 28 pounds which I feel like is
the standard price for a jacket and
actually looks pretty decent when it's
undone like it doesn't look that bad but
obviously if I'm gonna get cold I'm
gonna want to sip it up but it just
looks ridiculous dipped up so what the
heck am I meant to do you guys this coat
is it definitely going back okay the
very last thing I have to try is this
little black crop top so let's try it on
the reason why I picked this out is
because it had like a really cool like
crisscross effect on the website so
let's have a little look so it's got
these two things which I'm pretty sure
I'm meant to cross over like this and
then tie it at the back I guess okay
do you know this is Ted pounds like that
was you a pretty good price for a top
like this I feel like this is such a
good all-around top like you could
definitely layer up with this or you
could definitely just wear it by itself
like in summertime I like it
I like it I'm gonna give up though so
that was my pretty little thing whole I
really hope you guys enjoyed err I
honestly feel like a lot of these things
would be very difficult to send back
because I love so many things there was
definitely a few pieces where I was kind
of like man this is already my cup of
tea but I'm actually really pleasantly
surprised like the quality of most of
these products were really good they fit
pretty well so I feel like a pretty
little thing is worth the hype if you
guys would like to see me try out any
other clothing websites from online
definitely let me know in the comments I
feel like I really want to do either
romwe or she inside next I also have a
wish video coming up like a wish hall so
I'm really excited for that so make sure
you guys stay tuned for that as well
