my channel so in today's video as you
can see by the title what we're gonna be
doing and I spent sort of video on that
for now you guys example it's one of the
most requested videos whenever I do
these I spend videos so I thought it'd
be really fun to basically pick up a
whole box is good easier to try on for
you guys if you guys are brand-new here
come and join at the dinosaur family by
subscribing down below but without
further ado let's get on into the video
okay so for this video I thought I might
as well just basically open everything
up on camera as we sat down and just
have a little chat about it and then I'm
gonna try it on okay so the first item
that I have is this adorable little
place ooh oh my god I am actually in
love just look at it it's so summery
it's got sunflowers all over it I mean
what more could you ask for this is the
cutest thing ever I actually feel like
this is a really nice fabric as well
like it has a lot of weight to it which
definitely means that it's good quality
and this is actually super affordable I
have the price on screen right now so
you guys can see how much everything is
for the next item is a pair of shorts I
feel like I actually don't own enough
shorts like I love shorts and I wear
them all throughout the summer I prefer
them way more than skirts so I feel like
Shores are just such a staple piece in
anyone's wardrobe and these ones are
just white which I actually don't have a
white pair of shorts at all so I really
like these because they have like a
really nice a frayed edge the fabric
feels really nice like it feels like
really sturdy denim so I'm really happy
about this purchase because again it was
so affordable and these are obviously
high-waisted I wear everything
high-waisted so these are perfect so
this is the next item and I actually
don't even remember what that says but I
just wanted to say how cute is
everything like packaged like everything
comes in like this sort of I don't even
know what this is like a little pouch
but it's really cute like I as you
really like the packaging from duffel so
this is the next item oh I remember now
so it's basically like a bikini
two-piece set sort of thing and it's got
like a high-waisted I should don't know
which way this is meant to be there we
go this is it so this is the bottom of
the bikini and this is the top so it's
just like a very plain a simple bikini
but I actually really liked it because I
love at the color like I love yellow and
orange I just think it's such a pretty
color
summer the fabric is super stretchy so I
feel like this will be really comfy
bikini and it also feels quite thick so
I feel like you won't be getting any
like nip slips or anything like that so
I'm really really happy I got this now
the next item is a top which looks like
this it's basically just like a wrap
front sort of top it's quite corrupt as
well which I feel like will be so nice
if you just want to pair it with so
short it's a fabric it's kind of thin
but it's really lightweight so I feel
like it'll be really nice for summer
because you won't get too sweaty and air
and I love the sleeves like they're
really wide and kind of like I don't
know just I don't even know how to
explain it but they're really wide and
really cute so I picked this up and I
love the color as well I think it's so
on trend so this is the next item and oh
my god I am actually in love with this
it's basically just like a v-neck sort
of top it's kind of more of a shirt
really the fabric is really really soft
and it's like really thin as well so
again this will be perfect for this
summer holidays and honestly it's been
so hot in England in the past few days
so I'm totally gonna be rocking this
very soon and I just really love the
pattern of it like again the sleeves are
quite wide so it's really relaxed it's
also got some buttons at the bottom and
then also like a tie front sort of
detail so you can tie it up into a bow I
honestly feel like this looks so much
like a H&amp;amp;M piece or something but it was
from saffle and it was so inexpensive
the next item that I have is this little
two-piece which basically comes in a
form of like a triangle top and then
it's also got some shorts for the
bottoms which are just the cutest thing
ever I absolutely love them they're like
really frilly and just really girly and
they have this really nice lace sort of
pattern all the way at the bottom and
the trim is so beautiful I would totally
see myself wearing this kind of thing
maybe at the beach it was like a beach
cover-up or something so I feel like
this wouldn't be too appropriate to wear
for like you know a casual day out or
anything no I just get like beach vibes
from it so I would totally rock this at
the beach but probably not for like
everyday just walking around casually
the next item I picked up is another
like beach slash pool related sort of
item because obviously summer's coming
up so your girl's got to be prepared so
I picked up this a swimsuit and it's
basically just like a plain red swimsuit
it's kind of ribbed as well it's
super super super high cut like can you
see that literally there's gonna be so
much lag on show but I'm actually kind
of feeling that and also there's some
buttons on the side just for like a
little pop of detail which I really
really like so the next item I got is
this right here which is basically the
cutest little blue dress ever it doesn't
really show it much justice as I'm
holding it up but honestly this looked
so cute on the website and I feel like
it'll just I don't know I just feel like
this is so me I feel like it's so kind
of like spring and summer appropriate I
just I don't really have enough things
that are this color in my wardrobe but I
really like the color it's just
basically like a pastel blue which it's
just so gorgeous it's kind of like tight
fitted as well but I loved that it was
ribbed so I am totally gonna be rocking
this in the summer you guys just wait
till you see this on the gram the next
item that I picked up is a pair of
shorts so these are just like black kind
of like jogger style shorts I absolutely
love the fabric I feel like it's so
different to any shorts I actually own
it's definitely quite thick and it
definitely has quite a bit of weight to
it so I feel like it's kind of you know
good quality and it's basically just got
like a drawstring kind of thing at the
front I feel like you guys can't even
see cuz it's so black but you guys will
see when I have it on and these shorts
are super stretchy as well so you could
totally wear them out or to the gym
literally whatever tickles your fancy
the next item that I got is a little
crop top which looks like this and I
absolutely love it I love the color of
it it's so nice and like summery you
guys know the drill
I just love anything yellow you'll see a
lot of yellow throughout literally any
of my social media so I really really
liked this and I just picked it up and I
love the detail on the front it's like a
crisscross sort of effect I don't if you
guys can see but I just thought it's a
really nice crop top you know just kind
of casual you can totally dress it up
and dress it down I just picked the
socks I feel like I need more basic tops
like this but still things that inject
some kind of color into my wardrobe and
since I love yellow so much I just
needed to get this next up I have
another bikini I feel my example is so
known for like their swimwear so I just
need it to you know stock up on my
swimwear so I got a little like bando
sort of top and then it came up with
these little bottoms
which I feel like is the star of the
show right here because obviously
they're so flashy like I love the
pattern I love anything that's like
banana leaf or palm tree kind of design
so I had to get these and I love how
like understated the top is because
obviously the whole focus is on the
bottom so I feel like this will be a
really cute bikini the next item I have
is this little body which I absolutely
love I love the color of it it's such a
pretty like camel / nude / tan the sort
of color which is so on-trend right now
and I love the fact that it's got like a
lace-up sort of pattern in the middle as
well as on like the hips I think that's
so interesting I've never seen anything
like this before
I mean I've obviously seen things that I
like lace up on the front but never like
on their hips so I feel like that's so
cool and it does come up with the little
straps as well so you can kind of just
lace it up yourself which i think is
just so so cool I love anything lace-up
you guys know this what do we have here
so this is the next item and oh I
remember seeing this this is so cute so
basically it's like a blouse sort of
fabric but it's not too thick you would
think that it's kind of thick with the
way it looks but it really isn't like
it's a really nice flowy sort of
material and I just really liked it I
just I don't know I don't own anything
like this it has like subtle bell
sleeves which you guys kind of know how
I feel about bell sleeves I don't
usually like them but when I saw this I
was like no that's not chic white cute
it's kind of subtle so I can totally
deal with it I think perhaps this fabric
is a little bit too warm for like some
Arbor for like the colder days I totally
would wear this as it looks so cozy now
the next item is another little dress
which looks like this it's kind of like
a really pretty nude color and I love it
because it basically has like a Bardot
effect however you actually have to tie
it yourself so it's kind of like a tie
sort of effect on your shoulders which
is so cute and it's very like flowy on
the bottom which I really like it's kind
of like an a-line skirt I think it's
called and it also has a zip on the back
so it's really easy to get into I love
that sometimes dresses can be really
difficult to get into but if it's got a
zipper you're all good the next item I
have
another little crop top which looks like
this basically it's like a strap sort of
top but it also has this little Bardot
Bell sort of sleeve on the sides which i
think is just so cute this sort of color
is something I wouldn't usually go for
but I actually really like it and I love
the fact that it's lace up again I think
it just adds a little bit of something
to the outfit and the next piece is
another bikini eyelet she just went to
town with all the bikinis but I really
really liked this one I've seen it so
many bikinis like this on Instagram like
so many bloggers wear bikinis like this
and I really wanted to pick one up to
try it for myself and basically it's
like a white ribbed sort of a high
waisted butter which has straps which
basically just kind of like cross over I
think from the back and then just secure
onto your shoulders I'm pretty sure
that's how it works and then for the top
half it's like a simple sort of a
bandeau top which is just really really
cute very simplistic but it goes so well
with the bikini bottom so I'm really
excited to try there so the next one I
have is very similar to the previous one
that I showed you it's kind of similar
sort of concept it's got like the top
half and then the bottom half is kind of
secured together I really like this
because it's kind of attached on the
size of these cute little bows and I
love the color as well I feel like red
is such an understated color so when I
saw this I just really really wanted to
try it I then picked over yet another
bikini oh my god I went in like
literally so I got this one right here
which is like peach I guess this kind of
a peach color more of a nude I don't
know it's kind of peachy so I got this
this is what it looks like from the back
and it's just like really simple again
bando but it has got the like neck strap
and then the bottom half is just like a
high-waisted matching a peach bottom
which I really like and I like the fact
that it's not too cut out so it kind of
you know it covers the peach the next
item is another two-piece so this is
what the top half looks like it's kind
of like a ruched sort of crop top maybe
this would even be classed as a brawler
I have no idea but I really like this
the fact that you can like tie it up
yourself on the actual line
shoulder-straps is really cool because
you can obviously adjust it to however
you want it to be and then you can also
like tie it the middle into like a
little bow as well which i think is so
cute and this is what the bottoms look
like they kind of need a little bit of
an iron but I love these that's so cute
I love the little frills I think that's
so girly and this will just be perfect
for summer so the next item is kind of
more of like her lounge kind of set it
is still like summery and I don't know
it's kind of like a bikini but not
really because the top half is pretty
much just like a Bardot crop top it's
got like long sleeves which I really
like you guys obviously know I love this
type of thing but then the bottoms are
literally just like a frilly bikini
bottom so I feel like it's kind of weird
but I have seen a bloggers wear these
types of things by the pool so it's more
like a loud to say I would say than a
bikini but it's kind of still classed as
a bikini perhaps this could be used more
as like a cover-up maybe when it gets a
little bit colder I like a pool party or
something but I just really like this
and I could totally wear this as a top
as well double purpose I then got this
little crop top which literally looks
tiny but these tops always look tiny
because they only fit you once you like
actually stretch out because the fabric
is so stretchy but I already like this
because it's like the super typical
Bardot top but it does have the lace-up
so it's kind of like too stereotypical
blogger items in wine and which I am
just obsessed with I really like the
color it's like a baby pink and I don't
really wear anything baby pink so I just
needed to give it a shot and try it out
let me know in the comments if you guys
are still enjoying the Bardot tops or if
you're over it I feel like the trend is
kind of going but I'm still clinging
onto it with day life and to finish off
this video I have another to bikini
splash swimsuits so the first item is
this swimsuit which i think is so
adorable
again it's yellow and it's stripe I
think this one is so cute cuz it's like
completely backless on the back but it's
not like too revealing I wouldn't say
like on the front it's still really like
you know I can totally wear this around
family and you know around the
with kids and stuff so I really really
liked this and the fabric is really soft
it does have like little pads in you
know the boob sort of area so you won't
be getting any nip slips or anything
which is really good and yeah I just
really liked it and the very last item
is another bikini so the top half looks
like this it's kind of like a sports bra
sort of shape but I really like it
because it's got like this really cute
like button up sort of detail in the
front which I feel like is kind of
unusual for like bras well not bras with
bikinis so I really liked this and the
straps on the back are adjustable as
well and then the bottoms just basically
look very similar
they're also ribbed they're not too
high-waisted but they also have the kind
of like button up effect which i think
is just so adorable and the fabric as
well is super stretchy which is really
nice I got this in a size Emma so kind
of for everything I think I've got on em
because the sizes are a little bit
different words that fall so I kind of
sized up a little bit but make sure if
you guys are ordering from them you do
check like the size charts to kind of
compare UK sizes to their sizes so that
is everything that I picked up from
Zappala I already had so much fun
shopping for all these things because
I'm so excited for the summer holidays
I'm actually going away to a Malaga this
year so I'm definitely gonna be wearing
half of this stuff to Malaga if you guys
