get into it hmm no new year new me I'm
guessing most of you guys are like roll
I emoji including myself but hear me out
hear me out so I you go did some damage
on a sus wait I'm overdrawn by how much
what have I done I basically went on a
sauce and I did some shopping and I
picked up this huge bag and I was so
wait a minute
Jesus this huge box smell kidding around
this box is like twice as heavy as me
right now so today's video if you can
tell is gonna be a whole but I thought I
would do one of those one branded kind
of like try out whole things I've seen
Patricia bright do these and I
absolutely love her China I think she's
so funny so I'll link her channel down
below so you guys can check this out I'm
pretty sure she was the one that came up
with this idea first so as you guys
might already know I am a frequent
shopper of a sauce and I love some of
their bits but whenever I shop on ASOS I
always go for like the safe options is
either like trousers or a jumper but
today we're gonna be breaking the
boundaries cause it's 2018 I thought I'm
gonna try and like venture out of my
clothings comfort zone that's a thing I
may simply wear for a bunch of clothing
options that I usually wouldn't go for
and I wanted to see what the quality was
like if they look like the picture all
that jazz and also the price point I
just wanted to try some new pieces that
looked quite cool on the website I have
know if they're gonna suit me if I'll be
able to pull them off but this is what
this video is for but without further
ado let's get on into the video okay
seriously I have no idea where to even
begin with it just want to say and this
came in the post and I mean a sauce you
just hit the spot you just hit the spot
okay first thing I see is this little
number now this is a cami sequined body
this is when the acyl storage and it
looks like promising on the model
actually so okay okay let go so let's
try oh it's got one of those like snappy
crotchy thing I never really liked those
do you guys like these I just I don't
know how I feel about them they kind of
give me a wedgie okay so I'm not even
gonna lie to you guys right now as I was
trying to put this on the actual strap
broke off and it is dangling somewhere
down here um what happened to us what
actually happened
I mean aced codes are usually so Q and
there's such good quality but this it
just broke off the second I put it on
and also what is going on here I thought
you meant to wear this with like
high-waisted jeans but you can kind of
see like the band from the actual way
that's called a body like from the body
you can see this part here I'm just so
confused so needless to say this is
definitely going back but I mean I
actually really like it it looks really
cute like this part here definitely
looks cute definitely would wear out
please excuse my bra but there's a lot
of back going on so I don't really know
if I like that as much but from the
front I just thought this was so cute
I'm so disappointed that it broke and
just as reference this was 28 pounds so
I mean if you're buying a 28 pound body
you don't expect it to break off before
you even try it on okay now this is cute
this is a lot better this is like a
little off the shoulder it this is
called the brave Tsukuba off shoulder
crop top this was only ten pounds it was
in the sale reduced from 25 pounds so
barley Inagua I just think this is such
a nice little black top it's very simple
for like I don't notice any outfit in
general I would wear this in the summer
I'd even wear this like now with like a
really cozy jacket over the top though I
actually thought that this top would be
really cute with these trousers here
these are
cocky kind of like tapered trousers or
with a pouch they come with about which
is good and I'm gonna pop these on
because I I had a vision okay so I
thought these pants would be hella cute
and I was not wrong guys these are so
cute okay now I obviously it feels so
out of my comfort some of these trousers
you guys are probably like or what she
on about but these trousers just fill I
don't know it because I'm so used to
like skinny jeans they just feel so wide
on me cuz they're so wide leg like look
how wide the thigh is on me
I just I'm so used to wearing skinny
jeans that like every single day so this
is something very new to me I never wear
trousers that's so roomy I am kind of
loving yeah I love this little combo
thinking about is actually really nice
too houses are actually super like
fitted around the waist which is really
good and even though these are really
wide on me I feel like I'll actually
keep them cuz it just looks so good
and these were 30 pounds which I kind of
feel like that's a good price for
trousers you pay that I like Topshop for
Joanie jeans so ok moving on I have a
huge white knit jumper this is
definitely something that I kind of buy
of my compass I'm hoping if I just love
wearing a chunky jumper with a pair of
jeans so let's crack it open and have a
little look oh yes yes I'm really
digging this I'm gonna sneeze hey oh you
guys can barely see what this looks like
it just looks so white it out but it's a
really nice a white jumper it's very
high neck I'm just gonna pop it on now
oh yes it feels so nice this jumper
feels so nice on I really like the fact
that it's very like thick and just so-so
chunky but also it has really
interesting sneeze it's kind of got like
this bell effect to the sleeves which
I'm not usually a fan of that's why I
kind of went for this jumper but they're
very subtle so I feel like I can still
wear them I have another jumper right
now which is another
new jumper if I recall correctly this is
in a really nice red color I kinda feel
like this will be a bit much for me but
let's try it on anyways guys I just
don't think this is a good luck I'm
sorry it just no no what why why do I
like this this just is not a good look
guys I'm sorry but whoever came up with
these bail jumpers no I'm sorry I just
can't do this to myself what is this it
looks like someone pooed in my sleeve
and the poo is just kind of like
dangling in there this is definitely
going back I'm sorry I just I can't make
it work I can't make the poo sleeves
work next thing I have here is a white
jacket
this looks really interesting on the
website and it's not something I would
usually go for um in terms of jackets
but I absolutely love buying new jacket
and just testing them out I feel like
jackets just make your outfit like your
outfit to be really boring and plain and
give junk it it just spices things up
now I don't know if it's gonna work with
the current outfit that I'm wearing but
we're gonna give it a try can you guys
even see a thing it's just white and
it's got like these stitches and a white
collar so this is from ASOS own actually
this was 45 pounds and be honest guys
does it look like I've got really broad
shoulders right now or like really short
arms
I just feel like this something that's
not working out for me with this coat
don't know how I feel about it I feel
like it's just weird what is this what
the heck is this my boobs are here my
waist looks like this like mm-hmm
no my bag is this coat guys I'm just so
confused by this like physique right now
I just don't really know what this is it
kind of it kind of reminds me of the
Lord Farquaad from Shrek do you guys get
that vibe cuz that's the kind of vibe I
get from this car this is definitely I
know this is going back right now I have
another top now this
is just a plain white and black stripe
top from River Island it looks pretty
decent little website so I thought might
as well give it a go again this is a
little bit of a different kind of top
I've just tucked it in to my trousers
but the sleeves are quite interesting
because they have my curve I don't know
like a bell kind of thing to them it's
not completely bow like but it just has
like a slit here and then it has a bow
and I just feel like it's a little bit
different rather than just having a
plain white and black striped top I
actually really like this it's like very
subtle it's casual you can pair this
with anything it's great for like just
your chilled day it's gonna look a
little bit more smart you know I do
really like this actually it appears
that I have quite a lot of tops in this
fall so I had yet another top but this
isn't my kid gingham kind of pattern so
let's have a little look I've actually
forgotten what this even looks like okay
so oh okay yeah I remember now so it's
basically like a high-neck top it's very
like roughly it it has really
interesting sleeves yet again does why I
think I picked it up I have no idea if
this is gonna suit me but let's try it
on okay I just gave grandma boobs from
this top I just can't look at myself
seriously in this like what is this this
looked so cute on the model I'm really
confused why I can't put it up she was
like proper popping her shoulder and
everything actually and that's quite
good from that angle but from this angle
I can kind of imagine why they wouldn't
take a picture from this angle really um
yeah it just it's it's weird like I just
don't think it looks good I just
what's all this excess fabric here doing
I just don't know I can't why why does
this not look as it did on the model
life struggles okay so this next outfit
I am kind of digging so it's basically
just like a plain white shirt
with this really chunky black belt I
kind of petted together cassette so it
would look good now I have to say I
don't really like this part here it's
just kind of too much like the colors
really really big and I feel like a nun
just doing that it just doesn't look
good so I kind of just left that a bit
open but I'm not really digging the
collar on this dress I have to say but
the belt is perfectly fine and these
shoes guys these shoes are so so nice I
just thought this would go so well
together I am kind of a bit disappointed
by the dress it looked a lot better on
the website and I don't know if that's
just me I mean I absolutely love the
belt but I just think the color of the
shirt just comes up way too high it's
kind of like swallowing my neck which I
don't really like okay so this next
dress I am actually pleasantly surprised
with I had no idea how this would look
on me on the model it looks amazing for
me I kind of just it's very hard for me
to find that perfect black dress so this
I am super super impressed with it's
giving me those curves which I don't
really have but yeah I think that looks
really nice I love the fact that it's
very like feminine on the neckline I
love this kind of like square cut
neckline I think it's so flattering and
feminine I just think this is all over
the perfect black little dress
it's like ripped it's got buttons all
the way down and I just really really
like it's very comfortable it's not too
short as well it's kind of like the
perfect sort of length so yeah this
resin right here is definitely a winner
over in like this so there I have it yet
another dress now this one is like a
knitted long-sleeve dress it's got like
a choker lace up detail which I am so
excited to try because I love these
types of jumpers okay so this dress is
so cute I love the detailing on the
neckline I think that's a really nice
touch I can see it has got a little bit
of fraying if you can see there so I
would probably need to cut this a loose
end off but apart from that it looks
nice ears a little bit see-through as
you can see you can see like my black
underwear underneath if you were to wear
this dress you'd probably have to wear
something a little bit more neutral and
maybe nude but apart from that I really
like this dress I think it's very cute
and it's so cozy as well we have another
dress now this one is a tad extra I'm
not gonna lie but I saw this online
right and I just thought I don't
actually own anything this extra in my
wardrobe so I'm just gonna get it it's
gonna try it on see how I look if I
don't like you I can always return it
this is the dress it's baby pink and
it's kind of like a kimono style dress
it's also got an underlayer which looks
like this this is looking a very pooja
breaky this is so tight I can't even get
into it oh okay I have to say I have no
idea what the heck I was thinking with
this dress I kind of feel like a
Victoria's Secret model backstage but I
don't think I would ever actually wear
this out I don't know if I kind of do
that it looks a bit better but when it's
like this it just looks like a bathrobe
that's like really overkill with the
sequins I feel like the model pulled
this off so well she was like proper
like bad and bougie
but this just looks bad not even the
booty pop so the next thing are these
chokers
now these are really comfortable
actually and pretty sure the sadly sold
out now on the websites I won't be able
to link these but I really like these
they're kind of like cinched in leg
cover to show you guys but they're
really comfy and they have pockets as
well which is so nice you can totally
wear these with like heels if you wanted
to but you can definitely just kind of
just wear them lounging around that's
kind of what joggers are made for Weiss
about it we also have a 11
yeah I couldn't do a hole without
another just because I love them and
when I slip slide I was like come on
this is probably the best of the jacket
you guys will ever see in your life it's
baby pink and obviously it's faux
leather but when I saw this I was like
no no I have to get this oh yes I like
it I am actually really digging this I
have to say it's really cute maybe not
with this outfit but I just really
really like the color of it I think it's
so pretty so girly I don't really see
jackets in this color very often so when
I saw this I was just like I have to try
this so I feel like this is definitely a
success with this jacket there's nothing
really off about it if it's really nice
the faux leather feels really soft as
well so have already got anything bad to
say about it and this is probably like
the first jacket I owned like this I
also apart from clothes I also picked up
two pieces of accessories so the first
thing let's have a little look so these
are these square shaped rose gold
sunglasses let me just pop them on for
you guys oh I don't know actually do you
guys think that this shape suits me I
don't I'm not ready I don't know if I'm
a fan they looked really nice on the
model but I feel like they're kind of a
bit big on me I want to say they kind of
given me fly vibes like a massive
massive eye and the next thing I got is
also a little mini handbag oh my god how
cute is this this is honestly I am
living for this this is so cute I wonder
how long the strap is actually of this
bag oh I actually feel like the strap is
long enough yes
and it's matching my joggers this is so
cute I'm living for this little satchel
bag now the very last thing I have to
show you guys is this now when I saw
this online it looked really cute I was
like I don't have anything like this in
my wardrobe so I just I just wanted to
try it out so we're gonna try it on and
basically hope for the best okay
look like a bogey it just tell me please
just tell me I mean I don't know if I
like this color on me that's that's the
one thing I'm worried about is it look
good or do I look like a bogey you
decided okay guys so that was my ASOS
testing out clothing haul honestly in
total I think I spent around 600 pounds
which is absolutely crazy and honestly I
loved some of the pieces so much but a
lot of this stuff is definitely gonna be
going back because some of the clothings
were just a bit off like they were a
little bit of a fail some of them broke
some of them just didn't really suit me
be sure to let me know what you guys
thought of these at clothing I attempt
so I'll have everything linked down
below I'm still not a hundred percent on
this jump up but the more I kind of look
at it the more I'm actually really
liking it so I might actually keep it
but let me know what you guys think
make sure you and let me know what other
websites you'd like me to test out I've
actually just placed a huge order on
fashion Nova which I'll definitely be
doing a video just like this about if

to try out then definitely it leave a
