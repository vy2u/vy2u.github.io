gonna get out of the snaps what have I
done to deserve this this is a situation
and a half how's it going guys welcome
back to my channel today if you couldn't
tell from the title I'm gonna be doing
yet another I spent some money on an
online website yet again last time we
did a sauce you guys really seem to like
that video so I'm gonna do another one
I'm doing a fashion Nova this time now
fashion over let me tell you something
about fashion over I've been seeing it
all over the internet like Kylie Jenner
West fashion over like all these
bloggers wear fashion over so I just
want to see what the deal is I wanna
know is it good quality is it a scam is
it like you know affordable that kind of
thing so basically I spent seven hundred
pounds again how how did this happen in
my defense I am just gonna say that it
was just way too easy to add click to
cart click to cart click to cart but
let's be honest that's not good enough
excuse I'm just gonna be like seeing
what I like maybe if I like anything
I'll keep it but majority of this is
definitely going Berber ain't nobody got
that seven hundred pounds to spend on
clothes if you guys enjoyed this video
make sure you smash that huge thumbs
upses down below leave me a comment how
was your day just just talk to me okay
and also if you guys are brand new
please come and join the dinosaur family
by subscribing below and also whilst
you're there don't forget to click the
notification bar button but without
further ado let's just jump straight
into the video okay so I have my box
right here it is living a heavy like
heavier than the Asus box oh did you
take most of the screen right now but
basically everything came in the one box
as you can see I actually was really
surprised at how quickly this came it
only took like a week maybe a week and a
half for this to arrive and considering
it was coming from America that's pretty
good now I didn't actually have to pay
any customs for this which is obviously
really really good I did not want to
spend even more money on top of the 700
that I paid so so far my experience with
that was alright didn't have any
problems now I am literally so eager to
just cry
this bad boy open and try pings odds so
let's do it okay so the first thing I
have here is this camo like court
playset don't really know what this is
oh okay it's it's like a skirt a comer
skirt and then like a camo Bardot
off-the-shoulder sleeve these Bardot
sleeves are really wide what the heck is
this gonna even fit me okay so this is
what it looks like on I am actually
really really digging this so this was
actually $30 on the website now I don't
know if this is worth $30 because the
quality of the material is quite cheap
it's quite thin but luckily it's not
sheer so that's really good I honestly
thought this would be really huge on me
because did you guys see how wide those
like arms were but obviously I really
like this little set fits really snug
it's giving me some curves which I don't
usually have this is a good start guys
this is a good stuff okay so this is the
next item this is like a perfect sweater
top that's what is called on the website
this is actually $20 which again isn't
too bad this is the type of thing that
you'd get on like a sauce or new look
Topshop those kind of places but I do
really like here I don't know if you
guys can see it but it's actually just
tuck this into the sky and I feel like
that makes a really cool outfit too now
the next item I have is a 2-piece like
hoodie set and Java so this is like a
cod 2-piece sort of situation this is
actually a set that Kylie Jenner wore
herself so when I saw this online I was
like this looks really good on her I've
no idea if it's gonna look the same on
me about we will see okay guys this is a
situation and a half like I can't even
get it on its so the lemming time it's
like a string inside the bottom of the
hoodie where I try and put it over my
shoulders it really really hurts okay
I'm in well okay so this is what the set
looks like on me does it look good I
don't really know I mean it looks know
when you're as good as I did on Kylie
let's be honest but
I mean actually actually I actually like
it you know I I'm gonna gonna give that
thumbs-up so as you can see it's got a
hoodie on the back which let's be honest
I'm never gonna use coz what is that
even I really like this that I think it
would look really cool for the gym but
it probably is a little bit too thick
like the material is quite warm and how
much was this set so the bottoms and the
hoodie were actually separate there were
20 pounds for the hoodie and 20 pounds
for the pants now that's kind of over
price if you ask me like this is half a
hoodie like it's not even a full hoodie
why would you charge to any dollars this
thing on the sea should have been like
ten ten dollars and then this maybe 15
but not 20 for both nah okay so the next
thing I have here is a crewneck mustard
crop top and some gene now fashion over
is known for their jeans at which I
meant to fit like curvy people now I'm
not saying I'm curvy but my waist is
quite small compared to my hips so I
always struggle getting like trousers
that fit my actual waist so we will see
I mean I kind of love it
I'm really gonna have trouble trying to
figure out what I'm gonna send back
because I really like this top like it's
very loose it's very flowy material is
kind of on the cheap hitch side I'm not
gonna lie but I really like how
oversized it is and how lightweight it
is well now for the trousers look at
that like at
see these jeans are probably the best
jeans I have ever tried they're really
cinched in at the waist as you can see
which I am living for whenever I get
trousers there's always so much loose
material at the back now with these
there's none of that honey so I am in
love with the jeans I would 100%
recommend them the next thing I want to
try on is something a little bit more
bougie it's a dress I saw this and I
just thought what the heck this kind of
thing is so I have really am kind of
nervous to try this because I haven't
know it if it's going to suit me this is
the actual dress though okay guys I mean
this over $60.00 not going to show you
guys too much but you can see my
backside I have never felt more exposed
I'm trying to like cover my privates
right now but look at this you can see
my underwear underneath there I'm
getting a wedgie right now I feel like
I'm wearing a thong I mean at the top
half and the idea of it is really pretty
like I love this top section it's very
very pretty but it's just a bit too much
and this was $60 for a bit of strap for
this I'm now gonna try on the eternal
love advantage set in purple I actually
cannot breathe in this now this is a
size small so I'm a slice more in almost
everything and this was so bloomin
difficult to get on now I mean it's very
tight it's giving me them curves which
like I always say I don't have any
curves guys but it's kind of making
curves somewhere and no clear way it's
so tight but apart from that I quite
like the shape I don't really like the
color too much right how the heck am I
gonna get out of this now I can't
actually get all these guys what am I
done to deserve this okay so the next
thing is this little playset it's kind
of like a grid sort of pattern
all the way down it's quite flared on
the bottoms I don't really know how I
feel about this I mean I guess it looks
ok I just wish it was a little bit
tighter around the waist because it kind
of just flops a little bit like that
I like how I like the fact that it's got
a thick waistband and also there's got a
zip so it's quite easy to get into
unlike the previous dress the fabric
feels quite nice but how much was this
though this is 45 pounds 45 pounds for
this I'm sorry that's kind of a price
it's not just me I think it's a bit of a
price so this is the next outfit now
this cropped jumper was 20 pounds it
just says New York City extra large I
actually really like the jumper I think
it's really cute the fabric feels a
little bit weird it's not the type of
fabric you'd actually expect this jumper
to be it's kind of like a fleecy sort of
material like very thin but it's quite
fleecy now this cost me 20 pounds which
I guess isn't too bad these shorts they
I'm wearing a kind of a joke like they
literally look nothing like they did on
the model on me they're very long
like literally my crutches here and then
this is how long they are like that long
personally I would go for something a
little bit shorter just cuz I feel like
it looks a bit more flattering on the
leg and this was $35 which I feel like
is quite expensive for shorts that don't
really look like what you thought they'd
be now I also have at this leather
jacket from a fashion Nova that I just
opened and let's try it on I have a
feeling this might be a bit too small
maybe I should have got a larger size
okay it's not so bad actually it
actually fits pretty well I love the
fraying and the rips and all that like
you've got really a nice spring around
the cuffs of the arms now I have another
to try out because I really loved the
other pair I was like okay I'm gonna
grab another pair just for speed and
they're really cinched in other way so I
can tell I'm already gonna love them
guys fashion Nova jeans right now oh my
god they actually stole my heart they're
really like nice and thick too so you
don't get that line of like your
underwear back here so I really like
them these were again a 35 pounds so I
guess that's like an okay price to pay
considering you pay 30 pounds at Topshop
I think for like journey jeans the next
thing I have is this very sparkly crop
top Wow okay will I be able to pull this
off who knows but let's try it on oh
it's very scratching to put on I'm not
gonna lie to you guys that was a hell of
painful
oh my god but I really like this table I
think it's pretty cute it's very like
scratchy around my neck I honestly have
no idea how I could physically wear this
out because I would just be in agony the
whole time okay so this is the next
alpha honestly I'm holding my hands over
my chest because I just feel way to
expose right now like it's actually
quite cute if it was a little bit more
covering but you can see all kinds of
cleavage and it's just like everywhere
it's a mess now the trousers are a
little bit sheer like you can see my
underwear underneath no really about
that trouser business but it's
quite interesting like little combo I
mean the trousers are really cool
because they've got these like huge huge
zippers but I don't know the top I
thought was really pretty and I loved on
the model but on myself I just feel like
it's a tad too revealing but I do still
think it's really pretty so maybe for
someone who's a little bit more daring
you could totally rock this so this is
the next item of clothing and now this
dress is so extra kind of doesn't go
down all the way to the floor which is
kind of weird but at the same time it's
quite cool because then you can see your
shoes if you wore this dress this is
what it looks like up close I think it's
really pretty like it's super super
pretty if I ever had any like fancy
event to go to I would totally rock this
dress now the price it was 50 pounds I
guess that's fair I mean it's really
nice and glittery
and really there's a lot of detail to it
so I guess 50 pounds is an okay price to
pay for this sort dress now if you
really like this dress but you felt like
the link was a bit too long it doesn't
literally go all the way down to the
floor
you could always opt for something like
this so they have pretty much the same
dress but in a short version this is the
second option and now I have a love-hate
relationship with this dress because I
love love the design of it it's so
beautiful it's kind of like mushy and
 you can see a little bit of my bras
I probably have to wear a nude bra
underneath but it's so pretty
the only thing is it's so bloody
scratchy like so scratchy
I can't even bury it right now and it's
such a shame because I love the dress is
actually the most beautiful dress I have
ever seen tell me why have you gotta be
made of sequins now the next thing I'm
gonna try is a matching knit set so this
is the Sondra crop top and these are
these soldier knit leggings I feel like
this that has like a double sort of
puppet it could totally be worn as like
a bougie going out sort of effortless
set and then it can also be worn as like
a loungy set because it's just so
comfortable like the fabric is really
stretchy I wanted she really lighting
this out I'm definitely gonna keep this
and this is the very last thing I'm
gonna try on ooh it's gonna match my
lipstick this is like a ruched kind of
dress this is what it looks like I think
this is so like classic and really like
romantic so I'm gonna try this on and
see if it looks any good on me so this
is the dress on I don't really know how
I feel about it do I like it do I not
like it hmm I guess it's okay what I
love about fashion over clothing is that
everything kind of cinches you in at the
waist and just gives you shape even if
you don't have it I feel like this is a
really nice dress for like a red-carpet
event or just any kind of event I mean
will I keep this probably not cuz I feel
like it's a little bit out of my comfort
zone it's a little bit too daring but as
a concept I really like it and I totally
really like this on someone else as well
so that was all for my fashion over try
on haul let me know we guys saw my
thoughts I feel like you guys already
know my thoughts from throughout this
video bye
to say I'm not she pleasantly surprised
like there was quite a few things that I
actually really liked there was some
things that I was a bit like me but you
know that's like with any website really
like when I went on a sauce which I love
a sauce most of the time and I bought
things that I wouldn't usually kind of
go for there was a lot of mishaps there
but that's not to say that the brand is
bad you know it's just like one of those
things you definitely also have to be a
bit careful with the sizing definitely
make sure that on every item you buy
there's like no the size chart and you
check it out and see what size you
should be buying apart from that I
actually really enjoyed my experience in
the fashion over I wouldn't really say
anything too bad about it so as a result
of this video I think fashion OVA
deserves a thumbs up to be honest I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
make sure you suggest other like fashion
online brands that you'd like me to try
out next like she inside or wrong way or
