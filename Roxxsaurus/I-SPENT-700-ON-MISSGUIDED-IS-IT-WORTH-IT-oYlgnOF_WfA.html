but maybe Couture potato and they
shouldn't look like a holographic disco
ball I kind of feel like what was I
thinking what is up everyone welcome
back to my channel so in today's video I
basically went a little bit mad on
misguided so as part of my I spent sort
of series I thought I would test out
misguided in a one branded clothing haul
I've tested a lot of different fashion
brands like pretty little thing a sauce
fashion nova she in the whole LA on this
channel and I actually realized I've
never even tested and misguided so I
went and spent seven hundred pounds why
I don't know why or how but I always end
up spending so much money on clothes I'm
literally running out of closet space at
this point but I just quickly want to
show you guys the box cause it's kind of
ridiculous this box was outside my door
wait a second
do you guys even see how big this is
I might even okay this is probably the
biggest order I have done yet
Before we jump straight into the try on
haul I quickly wanted to mention an app
that I have been loving recently you

this app as well because I have it

21 buttons at Rock Sora's we're
currently at 270 K so I really want to
get to 300 let's make it happen guys I
know we can do it anyways if you guys
want to see what I picked up a from a
misguided and see if it's worth the
money then let's get on into the video
okay can we just quickly talk about the
fact that they actually sent me Special
K in my misguided order god bless okay
so the first outfit is kind of daring in
my opinion anyways I saw this online and
it's like a sparkly two-piece it kind of
reminds me of a big disco ball but we're
gonna give it a shot I already feel like
I'm not gonna be cool enough to pull
this off but let's try it on okay so I
honestly feel what's so ridiculous right
now look at this I look like a
holographic disco ball I'm kind of
digging the shimmy sound that it makes
as I move okay so real talk I probably
would never pair this sort of outfit
with this body that I'm wearing but this
is the only thing that remotely fits
this outfit because everything else I
bought it's kind of like weirdly colored
and it just doesn't really match this
outfit I needed something like light to
wear but as a standalone piece I
actually really liked the body I think
it's really cool you can see my bra a
little bit underneath so you probably
would have to not wear a bra but let's
just talk about this little number right
here I mean I think if I went to the Met
Gala I probably would have won an award
like this outfit is just on point maybe
you couldn't tell I'm being super
sarcastic I actually don't really like
I mean it looks kind of cool and like
crazy but like working at the same time
on the model I feel like this would be a
really cool thing to wear for like a
party maybe but for me I just don't feel
like I suit it at all but I mean listen
to this I don't get it just for that I
don't think I actually mentioned the
jacket is a 55 pounds and the skirt was
a 45 which is kind of a lot like let's
be honest that is kind of a bit of money
I don't think it's actually that great
quality the only thing that's like
obviously different about it is the fact
that you know there's all this however
at the end of the day it's essentially
just like a mesh skirt and a mesh thing
so probably didn't actually cost them
that much to make this so I don't really
know why it's so expensive I guess it's
just for you know the aesthetic I think
I'm gonna give this one a thumbs down
but let me know what you guys think okay
say this is the next item now this is
kind of like a jogger set it's actually
a two piece and this is from the Madison
big collaboration that they did a little
while ago there's still summer pieces on
the website on misguided but not really
that many cuz everything is kind of like
sold out by now but I thought I'd just
give this a shot and you know I am
actually really feeling this like look
how cute is the fit is so good like and
the quality I just I love everything
about this it actually feels like really
decent quality like the joggers and at
the top are kind of like lined with like
always like a fleece material but not
quite it just feels very cozy I feel
like I could wear this like just indoors
while chillin but when I still want to
look a little bit cute so the drug has
cost at 22 pounds and they are cuffed at
the bottom I don't know if you guys can
see and the top cost 12 pounds which I
feel like is actually not that bad I
mean the top might be just a little bit
overpriced but seeing as it is a
collaboration I kind of expect that
really but for the joggers I mean 22
pounds is really not a lot for decent
joggers like this I am actually obsessed
with this I wish they had this like in
all the sizes so that you guys can get
it they might still have it but I'm not
so sure everything has kind of sort out
from the Madison beer range so if you
guys can get your hands on these and
make sure you snatch them up so the next
item is this little set is actually a
2-piece Bardot pj set so this was at 15
pounds
and these are at the bottom they kind of
look like granny pants I'm not gonna lie
and the top half is literally just a
little like Bardot crop top which i
think is really cute so let's try it on
and see how it looks so this is the PJ
set I have to say it's kind of cute but
the pants are really literally like just
underwear they literally look like
underwear or like a swimsuit or
something I guess for sleeping that's
totally acceptable I don't really have
anything to complain about I actually
really like this I think it's like
really flattering it looks cute yeah
what more could you want really to be
honest for like really cute pages like
this 15 pounds I don't think is too much
so misguided have actually come out with
a whole range of like Barbie related
things so I thought I would pick up the
summer Barbie shorts as well as the
matching jacket and I also have at this
little crop top that kind of reminds me
of like I don't like Gucci or something
like the pattern is just so similar okay
I am obsessed I mean look at this outfit
this is so cute and this is what it
looks like from the back so it's got the
Barbie logo on the back as well as on
the shorts so Matt you've really liking
this little set and I think the crop top
works really well for this outfit as
well the only thing I don't really like
about this outfit is the fact that it is
quite pricey so the jacket itself costs
65 pounds which is a lot like a lot of
money for a jacket and the shorts were a
little bit more of a bearable price and
they were 30 pounds I feel like that's
kind of like a standard price you get
for shorts maybe a little bit cheaper at
like Topshop but it's not really that
bad I actually paid around at 60 or 70
pounds for my Tommy Hilfiger denim coat
and that's actually like a branded thing
so I feel like yeah he's a little bit
overpriced but it's cute so what can you
do what can you do okay so the next two
items that I'm gonna try are these
rehears so this is a a faux suede sort
of like two-piece so I'm at the top half
is basically like a square neck crop top
with a long sleeve and then for the
bottoms we just have some cycling shorts
I honestly don't really know how to feel
about this trend do I like it do I want
it to die I really don't know but I'm
gonna try these for the first time I've
never tried cycling shorts and maybe
just maybe there might be a reason why I
haven't
so this is that I really don't know if I
love it or hate her I am torn I think it
makes my butt look really good but like
I feel like the fabric it's made out of
it's just so tight and I feel like it's
giving me like major camel toe so let's
not look at that but also because this
fabric is sort of like faux suede I feel
like if you wore this on like a hot day
and you sweat it just even though
tiniest bit you would definitely have
like sweat patches right there and it
would not be cute I don't think I could
ever wear this out comfortably knowing
that I have this sort of situation going
on right here which let's just not look
at that I feel like the cut of them
because they're so like mid length they
just don't look right on me I feel like
it's making my legs look a lot shorter
than they actually are so yeah I think
I'm gonna leave at the cycling shorts up
to the Instagram blog so moving right
along I have another two pieces from the
Madison beer collection so let's try
them on and see how they like so this is
what it looks like on it now overall I
really like the appearance of the whole
set I think it's like a really cool vibe
but I have to say both of the pieces are
a little bit ill fitted which is kind of
disappointing now what I mean by
ill-fitted is the fact that the skirt is
like super short now obviously I
expected this obviously it's like a
short skirt but because it's so tight
there's actually no room for like my
butt to go into so the actual back of
the skirt just appears really really
short I don't think I could ever wear it
out in public seeing as my bum isn't
that she like right here and for the top
half I don't know if you guys can see
this but the sides of the top are like
really I don't know like white like
under my armpits right there it's just
so wide there's so much excess fabric
that really doesn't need to be there so
that's kind of annoying and also just a
quick side no all of this actually
needed help from Matt to get into
because the zipper was like really stiff
and it was just really hard to get on I
really like where they were going with
this like I love the whole tie up thing
and I just really like the aesthetic of
this outfit but I just wish it fit that
tiny bit better now the next size I'm
gonna try on is at this little Barbie
bralette which cost it 15 pounds it
looks kind of small so I don't know how
it's gonna fare well I actually really
like this I'm kind of getting like a
Bratz doll vibe from this outfit is that
just me
I guess like the chain and then like the
stripes it kind of reminds me of like
Jade style I think that was the one I
can't remember don't kill me if I'm
wrong but I'm pretty sure this was kind
of like Jade like the punk one I feels
like so long ago that I've played with
Bratz dolls but this is kind of the vibe
that I'm getting I feel what if I could
actually wear this to the gym and be
like really cute at my Barbie crop top I
don't really have anything bad to say
about this I would 100% pay 15 pounds
for this I feel like it's actually kind
of worth it
most sports bras are kind of this price
anyway so I'm going to give this one a
thumbs up okay so next up we have a
little satin dress which is actually
really cute it kind of looks a little
bit wide but once it's on it shouldn't
do I'm hoping okay so this is it I
honestly don't know how to feel about it
and also what is this like on the model
this actually looks okay but I have no
idea how to like wear this it's just
really strange the shape of this dress
it's just kind of really unflattering it
just looks like I'm wearing a bib or
something I thought this was genuinely
gonna be a little bit cute for 10 pounds
as well but I'm gonna have to give this
a thumbs down the next dress we have is
a little bit more structured it still
looks kind of like wide and big I'm
pretty sure that's kind of like what the
fit is meant to be like I'm kind of
getting like potato-sack vibes but maybe
Couture potatoes if that's even possible
I actually kind of like here I like the
neckline I think it kind of makes me
think of like in medieval times when
people just wore potato sacks I don't
know anything I don't really like about
it is that there's a cheeky slit right
up here which is just enough to reveal
my butt cheek and I am not dealing with
that when you look at this you'd think
that it's gonna be kind of pricey cuz it
just looks it has like that expensive
look to it but it was actually only 18
pounds so well done this guy so this is
the next little vibe it's basically like
a chevron yellow jumper dress I guess I
actually really like the design of it
I'm kind of feeling a bit like a racer
girl something like lose houghton whoo
my checks aside I actually really like
this I think it's such a nice like
staple piece like I don't own anything
like this in my wardrobe so when I saw
this I was like really drawn to it and
you guys know I left my yellow so this
was 25 pounds can't really folds here
it's got little zippers on the side
that's the bit you're paying 25 pounds
for I'm kidding
this is actually really good quality
jumper so I definitely would pay 25
pounds for this I then have another
little Barbie item which is like a crop
top if I remember correctly and then
also some shorts to pair with it so
let's go through oh this is a key you I
am loving this so the shorts are kind of
studded which I feel like it just needs
to come back like studded shorts we're
so in in like 2014 or something unless
you saw everyone like DIY them on
YouTube and everything but I haven't
really seen them much these days so I
feel that they really should make a
return because they are actually really
great the hoodie is so cute I love how
cropped it is so you can actually like
show off your high-waisted jeans you can
show a bit of your belly as well so the
shorts were 30 pounds and the hoodie was
28 it is a little bit pricey for like a
cropped hoodie I'd probably only pay
like 15 pounds for it I think it's still
riku it definitely makes for a cute
outfit so I'm gonna give this a thumbs
up now the next piece I'll be trying on
is this now bear with me guys this
actually looked quite cute on the model
I promise it definitely looked really
interesting and a lot different to like
anything I've seen on the website that
day when I was shopping so I just
thought you know might as well give it a
shot I let you never wear anything like
this so let's see how it looked so this
is what the dress looks like honor
I literally sweated so much trying to
get this dress on because it would not
fit over my hips it was not having it
so I had to like wiggle into it through
the top and then I had to zip it up
myself now looking at it I kind of feel
like what was I thinking
and it's like very out-there I feel like
this is something that maybe like gigi
hadid would wear or maybe like kendall
Jenner but for me I mean what is this it
kind of looks like my dog's little poop
bag I'm not gonna lie let me tell you
something this dress was expensive it
was 70 pounds like for this
I guess it's down to like preference it
might tickle your fancy but for me I
feel like it looked good on the model
but it doesn't look good on me so this
is the next little outfit and I am
actually vibing with us on another level
I mean look at this jacket like I
absolutely love this now I'm not really
ever a fan of like
tassels or like tassel jackets but I
actually really like this one for some
reason though the jacket was a fifty
pounds which is again a little bit
pricey I feel like most denim jackets of
the sort of price though and then we
have other jeans at which cost 28 pounds
can't really go wrong with a bit of a
ripped Jean and then on the top half I
just have this little crop top that
serves California pretty sure this
jacket is so much fun I feel like this
would be really cute for like a festival
or something next up we have a yet
another dress which says a badass a
girls club or way oh that's so cool and
this is what it looks like on I actually
really like it it's very simple really
stretchy I feel like this would be
perfect for summer especially when
you're like hot and bothered such an
easy outfit and I think it's really
really cute and I love the color this
was 15 pounds as well which I feel like
is pretty decent for a dress like this
so I'm gonna give this one a thumbs up
as well and at the very last two things
we're gonna try today is this little
like cropped stripe heard and at these
paneled cargo pants so I have no idea if
this is actually gonna fit together but
we're gonna judge it is like separate
items so this is what it looks like
together I have to say it probably
doesn't fit that well together as an
outfit but separately I actually quite
like the two pieces I really like the
pattern on these cargo pants it's just
got like a little zippers on the side
which i think is quite nice and for the
hoodie I really like the look of it but
I don't really like the fabric the
fabric feels kind of like coarse on the
skin it's just not really the best the
look of both of these items are really
nice but like the quality I just don't
think is that great so I'm gonna have to
give these a thumbs down so that is
everything for this video I had so much
fun trying everything on I feel like it
lasted forever I just had way too many
things to try on in this video so I hope
