channel so in today's video as you can
see by the title we are going to be
putting a full face of a wish makeup
through the test however there is a
catch to this because you don't actually
get anything for free in life that's
just not how it works that so you
actually do have to pay it for shipping
which only costs about two pounds I
think patent which isn't so bad but
essentially it means you are still
paying for it so it's not free but it is
still a super super cheap so I thought I
would order a bunch of makeup and just
basically see what actually arrives if
it looks anything like the pictures or
if we're getting scammed here if you
guys enjoy these types of videos and
would like to see more like this make
sure you so much thank you some sup just
down below and also don't forget to
click the bell button to stay notified
of every time I post a new video bond
out for adieu let's get on into the
video first uh but we are gonna start
off with foundation of course so here is
my first free item now obviously like I
said I paid it two pounds for this
because I paid two pounds for each item
to be shipped to my house so this is the
Miss Rose a professional makeup but this
is a matte foundation in shade beige six
from what it looks like it should match
my skin but I have no idea if it will I
tried my best to match myself on the
colors on the actual listing but I think
there was only like four so you know
it's not really exactly the best
selection of you know shades so this is
what the foundation looks like and I can
already tell it's just gonna be way too
dark for me so we're just gonna have to
make do so I've just popped that on the
back of my hand and it seems quite high
coverage actually from what I can tell
I'm just gonna apply this all over my
face as I would oh my god no this is
gonna be way too dark I knew I should
have gone for the lightest shade but it
just looked so pale so I just felt like
this would have been like the perfect
match it does feel quite high coverage
though so we're not gonna judge it too
much on the shades today okay I'm just
blending this in with my Beauty Blender
and is super hard to blend out oh no do
you guys see that that is so orange okay
yeah this is quite difficult like it's
not like I can just bounce it into my
skin with ease
I have to kind of like smear it into my
skin with the Beautyblender which is not
good at the moment I'm not really a fan
of it I'm gonna try and blend this into
my neck as well just to kind of try and
save the day somehow I don't think
there's any saving this honestly look at
it it's just so orange and patchy why
well I mean I know why it was free
technically it was only two pounds but
still I feel like you could actually get
a better foundation at like Poundland
and that even be more selection to
choose from too so that is the
foundation complete I don't think I've
ever looked worse in my life like this I
don't know what it is about it it just
looks horrendous in the viewfinder I
don't know if it looks the same on
camera like to you guys but in the
viewfinder it just looks awful so I'm
gonna have to give this Foundation a big
thumbs down I'm sorry Foundation it's
just not working out between us okay so
here I have the next a little apostle
now I've already opened it a little bit
but I haven't had a look inside so oh
okay wait no wait and these the brushes
I wanted are you actually kidding me let
me just check on my wish because I swear
to God I did not order that Oh as if oh
my god no okay so basically I ordered
these brushes which look like that so as
you can see that is literally a full set
of brushes and obviously I felt like
it's you know too good to be true that
they'd probably be like really bad
quality well these are it but this is
what I got what like I know I only paid
it two pounds for this but why would you
advertise this when this is what I'm
gonna get that's so bad of them to do
that to be honest they just look
terrible I'm sorry right let's just go
in and move on to concealer this is the
concealer that I got and it's called the
pro longwear concealer full coverage
smooth and radiant it's from the brand
Sachi lady and it's in shade is 0-1 this
is what it looks like
surprisingly this
she looks quite nice like the packaging
looks nice the product looks pretty good
quality I guess and it's exactly what
the picture showed in the listing which
I'm happy about
perhaps this is gonna save the day so
I'm just gonna go in not bad I'm just
gonna try and literally put this all
over my face to try and salvage the mess
that is my face right now
this actually feels quite nice and it
looks really like high coverage as well
so you know it's kind of looking pretty
good for two pounds I'm not mad at it
I'm just gonna take my Beauty Blender
for this and it just literally bounced
that into the skin oh look at that that
is actually looking pretty good it's
kind of reminding me of the shape tape
concealer from top wow I am actually
really really surprised
so I'm now gonna take this product right
here which actually is a product that
doesn't even have a brand Alisha just
has the ingredients which I can't
understand they are very long and
complicated words so we're not gonna
even attempt to read them basically it's
a little powder contour kit so what I'm
going to do is I'm a just gonna take the
kind of like orangey white sort of shade
on the brush that we got from wish and
I'm gonna try and set my under eye with
this literally nothing is coming off on
the brush okay this is a good start
alright let's try and really dig in
there there we go hopefully I've picked
some product art and we're just gonna go
under the eye this is not oh god wait
that smell oh okay
sir I'm just gonna try and set my under
eye but I just feel like I'm playing
pretend makeup right now because there
is nothing on this brush it's just not
picking up any product at all I just
feel like a little kid trying to like
use a kid's makeup okay I guess that's
the best we're gonna do I feel like
maybe it's somewhat said it just a
little bit but it's just not the best is
it I'm gonna take mmm we're take this
one on this brush Oh a wrenching game
picked up quite a bit perhaps this will
be a better quality better try and
contour where there's
what Wow
oh my god it's not the best blending
with this brush but the products
actually pretty good I am sure I feel
like with a normal brush this would be a
lot better but for the sake of this
video I'm literally just only gonna use
these brushes
okay so contour is on and I feel like it
actually doesn't even look that bad I
mean it could do a little bit more
blending if I use the different brush
but this palette is actually pretty
decent I think like the actual payoff
over the other shadows apart from like
the powder one it's pretty good now
moving on to blusher I have this blusher
right here which makes you think like
it's gonna be a super big pan but it
really isn't and it's literally just
like a refill pan so it doesn't even
have any packaging which I mean you know
if you expected like a proper blush then
you'd be very disappointed if you got
there I thought this was gonna be more
pigmented than it is not gonna lie but
it's still quite pretty like it doesn't
look the worst I mean does my side
there's a sudden my face look really
patchy I feel like in the mirror it
doesn't but on camera my face always
looks patchy on this side whenever I do
these testing videos okay so moving on
to highlighter I picked up this little
product right here which they actually
on the listing use a bunch of like
different bloggers which I'm pretty sure
didn't use this for like the highlighter
so I kind of yeah it's kind of a bit
sketchy that they would use like
bloggers photos when they clearly didn't
use this product
however we are gonna put it to the test
it looks pretty decent it comes with
like a little brush applicator which is
kind of unusual for highlighters I would
say it's not about actually it looks
quite share but I like the color there's
not too much glitter in it either so it
looks quite natural which I quite like I
really don't want to have to use that
brush to blend this in so I'm just gonna
go back to my Beauty Blender and try and
like bounce it into the skin a little
bit okay no this is so hard to blend out
do you guys see this this is one of
these products that you literally have
to blend as soon as you put it on the
skin or else it's not gonna blend at all
and it's kind of like starting to take
my foundation off with it which is just
kind of really annoying right let's try
and apply a little bit more because I
feel like I've just brushed it all off
with my finger and I'm immediately going
to blend this into my skin like I said
if you leave it on it's just not gonna
budge okay so this is it I mean it just
ah it doesn't look good at all it
doesn't look like the photos they were
advertising yeah I mean it just looks
really patchy like the idea and the
concept of it when you first apply to
the skin looks beautiful but when you
like blend it out it just looks really
bad okay so I guess that's the glow for
today very patchy Bob we're just gonna
roll with it
now the next product we're gonna try out
is an eye shadow palette so this is from
a brand could pop feel I think so let's
take a look inside Wow okay so these are
all the shadows which actually don't
look that bad but you just again looks
like a miniature palette for like kids
in the photo I was just kind of under
the impression this was gonna be like a
lot bigger but it is quite small but
anyways let's put it to the test and see
how it looks on the eyes I really don't
want to have to do this but I'm gonna
have to use this little eyeshadow
applicator which I absolutely hate these
things are just so bad so I'm gonna go
in with this like kind of orangey sort
of shadow first I guess and I'm just
gonna apply that all over the lid guys
this is actually really good like it's
super pigmented look at that okay the
applicator is not the best for this for
that she really pigmented I'm gonna try
and use at the flat brush instead and
see if that works any better oh yeah
that is so much better it's kind of
coming out quite patchy on the lid but
the pigmentation is definitely there so
I feel like with two coats we're gonna
get there okay so there is quite a lot
of Fallout as you can see probably under
my eye which I mean it's not the worst
because I can just brush it away and it
doesn't
actually do much to my foundation or
anything but just bear that in mind it's
not gonna be like the highest quality of
eyeshadows ever so I know I said I was
only gonna use brushes from the set from
wish but I'll it she cannot leave this
like this so I'm just gonna go in with
like a blender brush and just try and
blend this mess out as the said didn't
obviously come with a blending brush I'm
not gonna lie I am actually quite
pleasantly surprised at how well these
shadows are blending out and the
pigmentation of them they are actually
really good considering this little
palette only costs two pounds I'm just
gonna finish off the look with this
color right here which is like a really
nice a red undertone sort of plum color
and I'm gonna take this on a blending
brush as well and just kind of sweep
that a little bit through the crease
this looks super pigmented I thought
that this would just be a really nice
way to kind of add a little bit more
color through the crease and make the
look a little bit more intricate these
colors are actually blending in together
so well I am so impressed I honestly did
not expect these shadows to be this good
at all so that is the eye shadow look
I'm now gonna move on to your eyeliner
so this is the eyeliner that has come
from wish and the box looks a little bit
squished is definitely seen better days
so this is what the product looks like
inside actually looks pretty good so
this is the aloe bond waterproof
long-lasting eyeliner it's got 12
millilitres of product inside and the
applicator looks quite promising the
smell is a little bit bad I'm not gonna
lie but we're just gonna go there what's
gonna apply this and try and kind of
create like a typical cat wing with it
oh my god look at that that's so black
okay so as this eyeliner is drying its
kind of becoming a little bit tacky like
it feels really sticky on my eye so I'm
really hoping that this isn't just
literally gonna crumble off my eye I
don't know if you guys can see from this
far but it's dried to be quite like
glossy which is really weird because
obviously eyeliner is usually matte okay
so this is the eyeliner finished I'm not
gonna lie it feels really sticky like my
eyelids just feel like they're gonna
stick together somehow it's not the
nicest feeling I'll own I've ever worn a
have to say it just doesn't feel very
comfortable and it feels really cold as
well as if I literally have like wet
eyeliner on that's just not willing to
dry I really hope that this isn't gonna
irritate my eyes or anything cuz they're
kind of watering already we're now gonna
move on to at the second eyeliner so
this came in a little box like that and
it's from the brand handian I think and
it looks like this it's basically like a
little glitter eyeliner they just sucked
me in to get this because of the
pictures they use they look quite nice
and the makeup was just so beautiful
this is what it looks like the
applicator looks quite chunky so I have
no idea if this is gonna go to plan but
let's just try and use it on the eyes so
what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna
take the glitter liner and just apply a
very thin line just above the black line
but it's quite - like how the payoff is
pretty nice like it's quite pigmented
there's a lot of glitters it is
definitely quite different to what I
usually wear on my eyes but I am
actually really liking this product I'm
now just gonna go back in with the black
liner to kind of neaten it up and go
over any bits that I have kind of ruined
with the glitter liner I'm also gonna
add a little bit of that glitter into
the inner corners because why not okay
so next up I'm gonna move on to you at
mascara so this one it looks a lot like
a mascara that I have seen on the
drugstore I'm not too sure what brand
it's from but I'm sure you guys have
seen it as well um so this is the day to
night glam eyes a defined length and
intense volume mascara so it has the
length brush which is like the first
part and it comes out like this so let's
just go ahead and apply this at first to
the lashes it's not really doing - most
of the lashes I have to say so that's
step one complete and now let's move on
to the volume end so let's twist that
open woah okay that product literally
just oozed out of the tube okay let's
try and apply this to the lashes as well
it's not really doing too much easier to
be honest okay no gonna liner is one of
the worst mascaras I have ever used so
this is the look complete now I asked
she did order a lipstick and a lip liner
which actually never arrived I
wait any longer to film this video
because I've already been waiting for
all these products to arrive for
probably like two or three weeks so we
will just have to use a different
product so today I'm gonna use the Tarte
East lip paint and this is in shade
salty but first I'm gonna line my lips
with this collection a lip liner I
always forgot I actually did also order
some lashes at frog wish which were
again free but for two pounds shipping
so this is what they look like they
actually look not too bad so I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply it those lashes
on seeing as the mascara I literally did
nothing to my lashes okay so the lashes
are now on and it actually looked pretty
decent now as you guys probably know I'm
not like the biggest lash wearer so
lashes are just always really difficult
for me to apply but these are so easy
because the lash brand is super super
thin I don't know if you guys will be
able to tell but you get so many pairs
for the two pounds and they look so
natural and not too much as for the skin
I feel like I mean it's definitely seen
better days especially my contour and
highlight however I feel like this
concealer has definitely saved the day
and I would say it's actually really
really good the foundation the eyeliner
and the mascara were just a big no-no
but in the end I think everything turned
out pretty well so I'm actually really
really pleasantly surprised do let me
know what you guys think of this makeup
and if you have ever purchased any
products from which I would love to know
your experience as well I think the
brushes from wish were the most
misleading I mean come on
what is this but anyways that is all for
this video thank you so much for
watching I really hope you guys enjoyed
this and make sure you guys that
subscribe if you haven't already but
that is all from me thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in my
