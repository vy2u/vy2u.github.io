can't be that bad right it smells a bit
weird
I'm Vanna banana I took my own uh what's
the lyrics this is gonna be a long day
what's up guys how's it going
so today I am gonna be testing out a
full face of low rated super drug of
makeup now I have seen a couple of
people do this on YouTube from like
testing Sephora makeup that are quite
low rated but obviously since I'm from
the UK I'm gonna be testing out a bunch
of super drug makeup it was actually
quite difficult to find the lowest rated
makeup cuz everything on super drug is
quite good like everything is like four
stars or five stars so it was a little
bit of a challenge but we got there we
got there so it's all good I've got all
of my makeup ready so if you guys want
to see what my impressions are of all
these low rated makeup items then let's
get on into the video okay so the first
item of makeup I'm gonna be testing out
for this video is some foundation now
this is the naturally matte collection
foundation in shade ivory this Ashley
has a rating of 1 star which is kind of
surprising cuz I thought collection
makeup is actually quite decent so the
reason why this has one star is because
in one of the reviews a lady said this
does not rub into your skin well I used
it for a week and then threw it away
it's such a shame that they used to do
the color correction foundation which
was great I would not recommend this so
I'm gonna see how this is gonna work I
kind of don't have high hopes after her
review but let's put it to the test so
I'm just gonna pop some of that on the
back of my hand hmm seems quite a good
colour actually so I'm just gonna apply
this with a big Beauty Blender
I feel like foundations it's just such a
hit and miss thing
with a drugstore especially because some
can just be amazing and others not so
great there's definitely one of those
things that you just have to try out and
test for yourself so I'm just gonna go
ahead and blend that into my skin ok so
I mean so far it's seeming to blend out
but it is kind of leaving patches of
like the foundation like left behind
from what I'm trying to blend that's
really really strange actually it's kind
of like clinging onto the skin in some
areas like obviously as you can see it
has blended out but up close
it's definitely got like patches of
where it hasn't blended out I'm just
gonna keep blending though I can't give
it false judgment before I actually try
it don't knock it till you try it
as they say kids don't knock it till you
try it I don't know if you guys can see
but around this bit it's literally just
dried onto my skin I can't even blend it
out oh my god what the hell
okay this lady was right this lady was
right it's just literally not blending
why in this day and age you would have
thought that like foundations have been
so highly developed that they wouldn't
do this anymore like surely you've got
the recipe now and anything else like
all these new formulas it's just like
works off of the basic but judging by
this I guess no yeah I'm not gonna is
quite a bad foundation it's just I don't
know can you guys see can you guys even
see this right now this situation so
that is the foundation I think it
doesn't look so bad from afar but like
knowing that up close this is what it
looks like it's just kind of giving me
anxiety so I'm gonna give it a one-star
just like the review now let's move on
to the second product which is the
concealer so how many stars was this
this was actually only one star as well
now this is the revolution makeup focus
and fix liquid concealer let's take a
look at some of the reviews so so the
first review says wish I'd have listened
to the reviews before by haters who she
says I usually like makeup revolution
stuff I get bored of using the same
concealer over and over and decided to
try this even though it was only two
pounds I regret it so much it's the
weirdest conceal I've ever used first of
all the M R concealers are extremely
yellow which I don't mind because I have
yellow skin but for others these
products that might not be an option it
isn't particularly a runny or light
coverage when applied but it just blends
into nothingness except these little
chunks of weather concealer has gathered
together almost looking like flaking
skin oh no not for me
please I've already got like flaky skin
all over right now from the foundation I
don't need more of that okay then some
of the other reviews headlines have said
like not satisfied at all
sad face disappointing a good price for
bad results poor quality you
what you pay for sorry I mean this
doesn't seem that promising I'm kind of
nervous to try it we've got to put a
brave pants on girls let's let's just
give this a go okay it can't be that bad
right okay here we go
so under oh wow okay that's kind of like
literally the colour of a banana like
right there I'm just gonna draw two
bananas under my eyes because I feel
like it's very appropriate right now
wha-ha-ha picasso watch out there's a
new artist on the rise those bananas are
very you know I mean you can tell
they're bananas right please tell me you
can home Vanna banana I took my own
what's the lyrics so yeah I think it's
time to blend this bad boy out let's see
if it's gonna be flaky like they say no
no no no no actually I honestly thought
it would be a little bit better than
everything wait I need to like are you
seeing this what is that look let me try
the other one I'm sorry what I'm sorry
like I'm not trying to over exaggerate
right now but it's literally just turned
into crumbles it literally looks like a
peeling face mark for Christ's sake
this is gonna be a long day that's
triumphant let me just let you wipe this
crumbly mess off of my face right now
I'm gonna give this a second go maybe
it's the fact that I use a brush I'm
just gonna use the warmth of my fingers
this time and see if we can you know get
a lot of something something out of this
concealer let's just try and blend this
out with our fingernail okay
no crumbles there so far I don't know I
have no words right now I'm kind of
confused as to what just happened oh no
it's when you leave it for a little bit
that's when it's like litter you can
only do one eye at time because when you
leave it on for too long
it starts going crumbly ok I've kind of
managed to blend it out but has it done
anything I don't think so anyways let's
just swiftly move on from that with my
eye bag still quite visible but let's
just take an all that for the rest of
the video I'm gonna move on to can snow
contour that's the one this is the
feeling cheeky sculpting palette by
Barry M and love the packaging is so
cute it's got two stars which is a lot
better than one star but it's still on
like the lower spectrum of ratings so
the only review for this product is not
good not the best have to use loads of
the color to show I would not recommend
it so let's try it out along with
Berrien products so I'm kind of
surprised that this is a lower rated
product a nice color actually isn't too
orange from what I can see so far so
let's go in do the cheek ball okay it's
kind of looking a little bit yellow now
I take it back guys I dig it back it's
very like subtle and you know a natural
everyday sort of contour but if you want
something like pop in like get your
contour and flake it's probably isn't
the product for you and yeah I think the
gold was definitely right in the review
you definitely have to build up the
products you get you know somewhere with
this makeup look oh all of my little
flyaways are so annoying many of you
guys have like really annoying like baby
hairs right here and I just never want
to cooperate because that is me right
now I don't think I'm gonna use these
other products because I have another
highlighter I want to test out but for
this I think I am gonna give it like two
or three stars personally because it
just is definitely like not as pigmented
as I would have liked it to be the next
product is a blusher so this is the
anyway at makeup Academy pixel effect a
multi blush so this has a start and a
half this was only three pounds on the
website as well so it's kind of
affordable and the reviews are quite bad
for this I'm not gonna lie so one of the
reviews says that poor product as the
headline so then it's
I bought this blush on a whim as it was
part of the 3/4 to offer on makeup and
definitely regret choosing this the
product is incredibly chalky and has
barely any color payoff really
disappointing I wish I'd look online for
the reviews before purchasing as I
definitely would have chosen a different
blush if I had oh that's a pretty pretty
harsh review I mean doesn't look that
bad in the pan so I guess we'll just put
it to the test and see for ourselves I
have this slightly big brush so I'm just
gonna kind of like swirl it around in
there and see literally nothing just
Cape like nothing this is a brand new
brush I've never used it yet and there
is nothing on the brush like I've
swelled it it's still nothing this
proper dig it in there it's still
nothing what I'm sorry no come on it
smells a bit weird right I feel like
maybe there's like a hint of color in
there just just a head okay there's like
a subtle like you guys see that like a
subtle glimmer it's more of like a
highlight I kind of agree with that it's
not too much pigment unlike the blush
side it's really just not doing anything
is it oh my goodness so I'm just gonna
try and apply it with my finger
even when I swatch it on my finger there
was actually nothing I literally barely
see anything on my two fingers like what
okay let's just let's just see what it
does I'm gonna it's just not really
there it's just not present it hasn't
turned up to the party I'm afraid so I
think I'm gonna give this a thumbs down
unfortunately and I'm swiftly gonna move
on to the highlighter which I'm kind of
excited for this one because I love like
anyway highlighters I feel like they do
a pretty good job at highlighters so
this one actually unfortunately only has
one star which I was kind of like shook
about so let's read some of the reviews
and see what other people think so
someone said worst highlighter ever
I bought this thinking it looked really
pretty I have used it twice and the
highlight has changed to a normal powder
as shown in the photo it may as well use
this for my powder foundation as it's
that bats do not buy I want to
you fund wowza okay I mean it looks
quite promising in the pan and I'm gonna
give it an actual test with a brush like
this and just you know apply it she was
right oh my god it's literally just it's
this you just a layer of like
highlighter and then underneath is just
like matte like matte powder let's just
put it on and see how it looks oh yes
get it girl I mean that looks really
pretty kind of like it but I think it is
too pink I think oh that rhyme but I
just quickly want to show you guys the
actual closeup of the product so can you
guys see this
I literally just swallowed my brush in
it like this and as I do that it's
literally revealing the powder
underneath like this is just a normal
powder it's not even highlight I only
have no idea what made them think that
this would be acceptable just to like
have a layer of highlighter and then
just literally a matte powder underneath
like that is matte so I am gonna give
this one a thumbs down so I feel like
it's just like a one use highlighter
you'll use it once you get the payoff
but then you just throw it away so
what's the point
next up I'm gonna be vomiting my eyes
now for this I honestly couldn't really
find a shadow palette that was extremely
low rated but I did find one that was a
two and a half stars so this is it and
this is the berry M natural glow eye
shadow palette this is what it looks
like let's have a look at the reviews so
someone said this does not show up this
product has three matte shades three
shimmers and a primer and a sponge
applicator the primer is awful I found
it chunky and made my eyelids feel
really greasy the matte shades did not
show up at all especially the lightest
color and the shimmers only just showed
up on my lids however they looked pretty
powdery I would not recommend this
palette and I am extremely disappointed
because the colors are beautiful but the
product is rubbish Oh burn okay so the
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take the primer and just apply that to
my lids and see what I think god I wish
I didn't use that it's just like it's
all crumbly oh why did I do this
I'm ready I'm ready for the shadow I'm
primed somewhat and then I move on to
this shadow right here which is like the
natural kind of base color and I'm just
gonna apply that all over the lid that's
you know it looks quite promising it's
quite pigmented but it is quite chunky
as it should just falling onto my
eyelashes my cheekbone everything and
it's like literally shedding its skin
inside the palate it's just falling
everywhere so that color is done now
let's move on to this matte color right
here it's gonna pick that up on the same
brush and kind of try and sweep that
into the crease it's not actually that
bad
like are you guys seeing this I feel
like it's okay it's not the most
pigmented shadow I've ever use but it's
blended out pretty well so is so far
however only got too many complaints I'm
just gonna take this color right here
which is like the shimmering color onto
my finger and just pop that in the
center and also towards the inner corner
okay it's not really the best like
shimmery shadow I've ever used it's kind
of like very sparse and sheer so I'm
just gonna have to layer this up quite a
bear can I just quickly say now that I'm
looking up real close in the mirror my
skin has never looked worse like
literally this foundation and this
concealer is just giving me all sorts of
flakiness and then they take this
slightly darker color which is like a
shimmery sort of purple color I guess
and I'm just gonna pop that on the outer
corner with my finger just cuz I don't
want to use this with a brush because I
just know it's gonna fall on half of my
face this is the look I it's definitely
not my favorite look I've ever done I'm
not gonna lie like the shadows are just
a little bit chalky so I feel like the
reviews are quite correct in that sense
I'm now gonna move on to the brows and
for this I'm gonna be using the MUA luxe
powder three and one brow definer in mid
Brown that is a mouthful so there was
only one of you on this product and it
said a good value they left him one star
and it says the pencil end was fine but
the powder really brought it for only
lasted a week which I and then it just
ends such a weird review but kind of
what I get from that is that they liked
it but their powder which is this pot
here lasted only
week and then it dried up but obviously
I can't really test that for you guys
because I can't be sitting here for a
week waiting for this to dry up so I'm
just gonna test out the irregular end
which just looks like this
okay it's actually not too bad like I'm
gonna fade it out obviously but the
color isn't too orange or anything so
I'm kind of pleased with that okay so
this is what the brows look like I'm
just gonna sort of diffuse the very
beginning of them with a spoolie and the
colors pretty good it glided onto the
brows quite easily so I don't think I
would say that this is a bad product at
all so the next thing I'm gonna try out
is this felt tip liner this is from the
brand anyway and it only has one star
there's quite a few harsh reviews on
this so one of them says this was awful
I bought this eyeliner a couple of weeks
ago fairly excited by its promises of
making it easier to do at my winged
liner but it was not to be there seems
to be a very little product in the pen
and even less coming out on to my eyes
the nib itself was dry as a result
leaving the whole outline patchy and
dragging onto my skin Helly went into
the bin and there was no coming back
from that that is harsh so the tip is
actually a little bit weird like I don't
know if you guys can see that it's just
got like a very weird shape to it hasn't
really got a thin like point though I've
no doubt how I'm gonna get along with it
it's actually doing all right so far
then again I am using it for the first
time so I'm sure like after a couple of
days this is probably gonna be like
really dry god this eye is a lot harder
I really can't get that like sharp tip
to it with this liner I honestly don't
know how I did it with this eye to be
honest this is probably the worst
eyeliner I've ever created in my life
let me tell you guys something this was
a piece of work like honestly at first I
feel like it was beginner's luck that I
managed to get quite a good wing on this
side but then on this side it just was
so difficult to get that like sharp
point and then I tried to match it and
it just was a disaster like it was a
complete disaster
it was kind of already drying out to the
end of like me creating the second way
so I feel like it just would not last at
all I'm gonna give this one a thumbs
down so this is the dark magic Max
Factor mascara this only had one star
which is quite bad and the Ruby
says the worse mascara I have ever used
eek
I brought this to try something new from
Max Factor and my disappointment is
really huge I used the one thousand
calorie from Max Factor for many years
that tried other ones but this is awful
my eyelashes look like dead wet spider
legs the structure is a HUD had hetero
hetero genus is that how you say it I
have no idea the brush is no good too
I would never recommend this and throw
away mine after two uses that is pretty
harsh but let's see if it's as bad as
this lady claims it's actually not so
bad like I don't know if you guys can
see anything but there's definitely not
too much product being distributed to
the lashes it's kind of more of like a
natural mascara I would say it's not
making them look clumpy asshole I really
have no idea what this lady was on about
but like I said every product is
different for every single person so
although this was not very good for her
it might be great for someone else I've
got to say this definitely isn't worthy
of one star I feel like this probably
would make it up to like two stars for
me because personally it isn't the worst
mascara I have ever used like I've used
quite a lot of like really bad mascaras
for videos like this so I'm gonna give
this like two stars I think lastly for
the lipstick I'm gonna test out a
product that wasn't actually that low
rate it has got three stars which isn't
like the lowest it's definitely over
halfway so this kind of would mean that
it's you know a little bit on the better
side than low side however I honestly
couldn't find a lipstick that was low
rated so I had to go with this one it
was the lowest I could find most of the
rubies are actually pretty decent and
everyone says they like the product
however there is one review that has two
stars and the lady said the actual
lipstick is good but doesn't match the
matte liquid lipstick in this set is so
good and nice color and has good stay
but the lip pencil does not match ass
for pretty disappointing because if they
did match there would have been a great
product there's quite a nice color
actually it applies really smoothly onto
the lips so I haven't got anything bad
to say about the lip liner but now let's
try and the liquid lipstick okay I see
this lady was talking about the lipliner
is a lot more orange than the lipstick
like the lipstick is kind of like a movi
sort of cool toned kind of color but the
lip line is like a bun orange sort of
shade so it definitely is on the closest
match but it's not like that noticeable
so this is the finished look I'm using a
full face of low-rated Superdrug makeup
I honestly had no idea how this would
turn out if I was literally gonna end up
looking like a disaster by the end of
this video but I have to say once
everything is on my face it doesn't look
that bad I'm sure that from afar you
guys probably can't really tell that I'm
wearing my rated makeup and that some of
these items might not be the greatest I
think my favorite pie is definitely the
lipstick and then the highlighter
although obviously we know that this
highlighter is not gonna be that great
let me know what you guys think of this
makeup and all of the products I use if
you guys ever use them before I would
really be interested to know I actually
had fun filming this video I feel like
you know you get to kind of test for
yourself and these products are right
for you or not a lot of the time the
reviews were kind of correct so I feel
like it's actually quite good to follow
the reviews and trust other people's
opinions when it comes to makeup however
like I said these products may not be
the best for me and some of these people
that are writing these reviews however
there might be just right for you so you
guys have to just kind of test things
out for yourself and make up your own
mind video is obviously not to bash any
of the brand's at all I love most of
these brands that I use and use them
quite a lot on an everyday basis but I
have had a lot of fun with this video so
if you guys enjoy this I might do
another one maybe with boots so give
this video a thumbs up if you would like
that but that is all from me thank you
so much for watching and I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
