today as you can tell by the title we're
gonna be testing out some really really
interesting products so I wouldn't
interpro muck the other day in London
just casually shopping and I came across
these products and I was like ok I need
to do a video on this so as you can tell
by the title today we're gonna be
testing out the new nudes range at from
Primark and I mean come on
is this a k'kaw Beauty dupe or not when
I saw this I was like shook like shook
it to the corner and in that moment I
just knew I had to test this out for a
video I've got a lot of a products too
from the whole range so I'm really
really excited for this if you guys are
new here make sure you guys subscribe
come and join the dinosaur family and
also don't forget to click the
notification dial just say notified of
every time I post the new video but
without the rambling let's get on into
the video okay so the first thing we're
going to be testing out is of course
this little highlighter slash contour
kit it comes with a brush that is
literally identical to the k'kaw Beauty
brush I honestly haven't tried the k'kaw
beauty products because I have seen like
mixed reviews on there and it was really
really pricey and plus shipping to the
UK like it just it wasn't for me so I
never tried it however I do know that
this only costs 8 pounds I mean if it's
any good it's already a winner in my
book so inside the little kit these are
the products you get so you get a cream
highlighter duo you get a brow
highlighter a little brush with a brush
as well as a sponge and also the cream
contour duo first thing I'm going to be
testing out is the cream contour duo so
this is what it looks like the packaging
is so close to the k'kaw like contour
sticks this is what the original
products look like I mean the packaging
is pretty close and with this contour
stick you do get two ends so to start
off with I'm just gonna take the lighter
shade and just kind of contour in all
the irregular places okay this is very
very pigmented it feels quite creamy on
the skin actually and you're gonna
contour on my forehead my temples oh
they use I have to say when I was
looking at this product in store I was
trying to find like different kits for
maybe like light medium and dark skin
type however they did only offer the one
set of shades which is kind of annoying
because this
I'm gonna be everyone's cup of tea like
it's not gonna match everyone's skin
tone okay so I've gone full out today
I've contoured my draw I've contoured my
cheekbones my nose literally everything
I'm then gonna take the highlighter
stick and just try this out as well so
okay it's got two different ends it
appears that it's got a darker highlight
as well as a lighter shade of highlight
I feel like this one is just gonna be
way too orange for me I feel like that's
not even meant to be a highlight
I'm so confused this is literally matte
like it's not a shimmer highlight I
don't really know what to do with it is
it meant to be a concealer I'm just
gonna try it out anyways I'm gonna like
pop it here oh no oh no that is not my
shade oh no I've got to do on the other
side or else it's not gonna do the same
okay the orange shade is a no-no from me
let's try the shimmer shade it's really
not doing much is it I don't know I'm
gonna try out my nose it's kind of there
on my nose it's very subtle though but
at the end of the day I do have to
remind myself that the whole like m'kay
range is meant to be very like neutral
not blinding so I kind of guess that's
where they were going with this and
lastly I'm gonna take the brow
highlighter pencil from this palette and
just apply it to at my brow bone oh
that's actually quite nice I would
actually use this as like an all-over
highlight I kind of prefer it more than
this highlight here I'm now gonna try
and take the brush and blend all of this
out now I did see all of the like
reviews of the k'kaw brush and everyone
actually hated this brush so I have no
idea how this is gonna feel on my skin
like this brush feels really really soft
this doesn't feel too hard I remember
people saying the original sponge of the
brush felt really really hard on the
skin I think I'm actually gonna wet the
sponge because that's what I tend to do
with my being blender so I have just let
my sponge and I'm just gonna go in to
the contour and start kind of blending
that into the skin okay a please blend
this is scary please do not do this to
me
it's blending out false alarm looking
kind of patchy no I don't know I don't
know about this guy's okay so the brush
does well but I do find myself having to
do this a lot rather than dabbing in
because I feel like it's just not doing
a great job at blending out I don't
usually use my blender like this you
guys I do like Pat it into the skin but
it's just really difficult to have to
like blend a whole line of contour out
of this cheaper I'm gonna try and use at
the other end just to see how that works
maybe it'll do a better job at blending
this it feels very soft on the skin
and it definitely blends it out a lot
quicker yeah I definitely feel like this
side has blended out a lot better than
this side but let me know what you think
in the comments let's try and tackle the
forehead next I'm gonna try and blend
the highlight out now but the only issue
is this sponge is now dirty with contour
so maybe I should have blended out the
highlight first but I'm just definitely
working a lot better for the highlight
because it's not such a harsh pigment to
have to blend out okay so the last part
we have to blend out is the nose I am
most terrified for this because this
could end up a disaster with this brush
I think I went a little bit too much on
the contour just a little bit I'm gonna
try and diffuse this nose contour a
little bit with the sponge like the
highlight looks very shiny on my
forehead so I might have to set that
with some powder but everything else I
feel like it looks pretty good I feel
like the only bad thing about this
product is that you can't leave it on
your face for too long I feel like I did
leave the contour on for too long before
I blended it out because I was taking
some thumbnails and stuff so that's
definitely not the products fault but it
was quite difficult to blend it out
because of that so I feel like once you
put on your skin you have to blend it
out straight away but I feel like we
still managed to get a pretty nice blend
like it looks quite natural it's not too
much I am gonna have to set the forehead
now the next product I'm going to be
testing out is this right here now this
isn't really necessarily a kqw jus but
it's just one of the products that was
kind of interesting from the news
collection from Primark this is the
nudes of body shimmer dust and although
it says body shimmer it definitely could
be used as a highlight for your face the
others have a little sponge like this
and this only cost four pounds now the
packaging is really really pretty
is definitely something different than
the usual Primark maker PC I'm actually
going to apply this a whip and the
little sponge that we got in the contour
kit so it's gonna pick up a little bit
of that on the brush side and just apply
it to see my cheekbone oh my god you
guys Primark is not playing we're gonna
try and blend it out a little bit with
the sponge as well just so it kind of
becomes a part of the skin but holy moly
this is just beautiful you know that
feel when you get like a super
affordable highlight but it comes
through and you kind of just never want
to not use it again and I kind of want
to bake my face in it right now I'm not
gonna lie I'm kind of loving this
highlight I'm just literally putting it
in any place that is acceptable to be
put your highlighter do I look like a
glowing disco ball yet I think I do so
the next product I'm gonna be using is
this right here so this is the PS nudes
eyeshadow collection now again this
isn't necessarily like a k'kaw jube but
it's definitely like in the same theme I
don't even know if Kim Kardashian does
eyeshadows but this is really really
nice-looking so I just wanted to pick it
up and test it out so this palette cost
me eight pounds and it's actually quite
a large palette with a lot of different
shades so I feel like this is again
something quite new for Primark cos
they've never done anything like this
okay so first up I'm gonna take this
shadow right here as a sort of
transition color through the crease you
guys know the drill
I'm really hoping there's not gonna be
too much fallout with this palette okay
for a transition color kind of
impressive I thought it wasn't gonna
really show up on my skin and then gonna
take the slightly darker brown shadow on
the same brush and I'm just gonna pop
that further into the crease to really
deepen it up oh my god this my shadow is
so pigmented and it's like really creamy
and super easy to blend I did not expect
this to be that good that blended out so
quick I'm actually shook guys I'm
actually shook okay so far so good I'm
also gonna pop that on my lower lash
line as well just to tie in with a whole
lip next I'm gonna take this burgundy
shimmery shadow this looks so nice I
mean look at that color
that is so pretty wow this color was
just literally
made for me it's so pretty probably
there's actually not too much fallout
from this Paulo which I'm super
impressed about I'm now going to take a
tiny bit of this coppery gold sort of
shadow and just pop that on the very
center of my lid oh my god this is so
pretty and it's actually quite pigmented
when you apply with your finger - and
lastly I'm gonna take this matte dark
brown sort of shadow just to pop in the
outer corner for a little bit more depth
so that is the eye shadow that complete
I feel like it looks really good like
the colors are so bright and vibrant and
I just love the texture of them I love
the fact that there was hardly any
fallout and you definitely get the color
payoff with this palette there's so many
colors to choose from I barely like used
any of them I only use like four or five
I'm now just gonna finish off the rest
of my eye makeup and I'll be right back
okay so I'm just finished doing my eye
makeup I've just gone for like a winged
liner and I've also lined my lips ready
to test out these bad boys right here so
these are the matte and gloss collection
these costs are six pounds so you get I
think three matte and then one gloss
lipstick now the first thing I notice is
that they are definitely a lot different
from the k'kaw liquid lipsticks main
reason being that they are actually
different shades of nude rather than
just one shade
spilling the tea much shade but honestly
the k'kaw were literally the same shade
of nude some are just gonna swatch all
of these separately because obviously
I'm not gonna try them all on my lips
this is the first shade from the left
whew that's a really pretty color okay
so this is the high shine lip gloss it's
not glittery but it is shiny and this is
what it looks like again that is
actually a really pretty color it's a
lot more peachy tone I don't know if you
guys can see whereas this one is a lot
more like pinky tone and this is the
next matte lip cream again very pretty
color
I think this lipstick would suit this
look that I'm wearing the best and
lastly we have the high shine lip gloss
which I feel like is more of like her
lip top ah it's very very shiny so this
is what they all look like up close they
are all such pretty colors and the lip
topper is so shiny I think for today's
look I'm gonna go with the darkest
liquid lipstick and just pop that into
my lips is such a beautiful color and I
feel like it will really complement the
look oh my god this smells amazing I
swear this literally smells like the
Kylie lip kit and they're just gonna use
a little bit of that shiny a lip top eye
just to pop in the center of my lips and
this is the finished makeup I honestly
really really like how I'm kind of
pleasantly surprised by some of these
products I think my favorite super eyes
are definitely either the highlighter
which was actually the shimmer like
powder or the eye shadow palette because
I mean look at this eye look is so
gorgeous but that is all for this video
