welcome back to my channel so a couple
of weeks ago I did a video where I
basically turned myself into Kylie
Jenner for a whole week now you guys
that video it is so super well you guys
have really enjoyed it and a lot of you
guys have been saying in the comments
that you would love for this to become
kind of like a series where I just copy
a bunch of celebrities for a whole
entire week you guys haven't seen the
first video where I turned into Kylie
Jenner I'll have it in the little eye as
well as in the description so you guys
can check it out after watching this
video but in today's video we're going
to be turning into ariana grande the
queen the legend I thought we already
find that to basically try and recreate
some of her like signature looks and
also some of her new look from her new
music video no tears left to cry where
she's actually sporting a silver hair so
stay tuned for that I want to know how
many of you guys are Aryan eaters out
there do let me know in the comments
below as well as giving this video a
thumbs up because I love ariana grande
so if there's any fans out there do let
me know in the comments also don't
forget to subscribe to my channel come
and join at the dinosaur family before
you leave but without further ado let's
get on into the video
okay so operation turned myself into
iron a grande a phase one is get them
outfits so I have my laptop right here
which will help me in the pursuit of
trying to find the five outfits for this
video that I already have in mind I
think this is gonna be super fun to
experiment with different outfits that I
probably usually wouldn't wear because
my style is so different compared to
ariana grande's she loves anything like
girly and frilly and fancy and she loves
wearing heels which I let you never do
but I'm gonna spend in the next couple
of hours online shopping which I am not
mad about six and a half hours later
okay the damage is done I have spent way
too much money but I don't even care I'm
so excited for you guys to see the
outfits operation time myself and
Ariana's step two is get that then
there's my Kylie Jenner video I feel
like my tan has completely rubbed off
and it's in Ariana Grande skin tone is a
lot darker than this I'm gonna have to
top up now a lot of somebody did this I
feel
my tan went completely patchy as I had
no idea what I was doing but this time I
have been prepared I actually applied
moisturizer and I exfoliated so
technically this time giggle me alright
today we don't you know turns on show so
I got to low cuz I'm usually as pale as
a point whitewall iron is handle and not
that's all yeah that was good
I am the next lyrical genius I never
know what to do about my armpits do I
apply tan there as well it just feels
wrong so well my tan is developing at
the next step to become ariana grande is
it to get a brown eyes in my last video
I did I use some brown contacts but they
want the best so this time I bought some
new ones and hopefully these should turn
my eyes to brown a little bit better
than last time
okay so this is my least favorite part
because I am so bad at playing circle
lenses
are you going to cooperate circle legs
you gonna be good okay so this is where
the tears begin I actually couldn't get
this on my eye no tears left to cry she
said well I've got plenty more where
that came from
hello I know in the comments below if
you guys also find this difficult yes
I've got one in about a hundred tears
later and one of my circle lenses is
finally in yes
alright so now I'm gonna spend another
half an hour to put the other one in BRB
the next step is to get that ariana
grande a makeup I absolutely love at the
type of makeup that she always does it's
very soft kind of smoky but always
really naturally pretty so that's
exactly what we're gonna do today and
this is the inspiration photo for this
look I do already have a little bit of
makeup on so we're just gonna be working
on top of that to try and make this
phase kind of look like this face so the
first thing we're gonna start off with
is at my brows I'm just gonna brush them
down a little bit to make them appear a
little bit more straighter as Ariana's
brows are super straight and also quite
thick and then gonna take the pencil end
and just fill them in so that there are
a lot more straight
so now that my brows are shaped a little
bit more like Ariana's of what I'm going
to do next is just apply a ton of
bronzer to my face because Ariana's
complexion is always super bronzed and
glowy so this is the finished ariana
grande look and now the last step is of
course the silver wig tada this is the
finish like oh my god this wig is so
cool I absolutely love it I think it
obviously does look like a wig but I did
manage to get a lace front one this time
just because the last one was so
uncomfortable and it didn't look very
realistic however I still need to get
better at styling wigs because it's
low-key so difficult but anyways that
now that my look is complete unless you
jump straight into the first outfit so
today is a Monday which marks the first
day of my week living as ariana grande
and today's outfit is this basically
it's inspired by this photo right here
where she's wearing kind of like a gray
jumper dress and a big thick coat I feel
like I managed to get a pretty close
match I'm kind of dreading going out in
this outfit though because it's super
hot outside today and I have this like
full-on winter coat on so I hope I'm not
going to sweat to death so today what
I'm gonna do for the day is pretty much
just hang out and go to Starbucks
because I feel like ariana is always
seeing it with a Starbucks so I just
need to get one a few moments later
I've been there all day and got me back
inside
don't eat the mission with my decision
to test my little ass cause it's my
business
that is my weakness so what a tonight
so we have a what was it for dinner from
vanilla pop and Carol
okay so I got my open latte and honestly
I love the aesthetic of Starbucks but I
literally never come here obviously and
you guys know from my previous Kiley
video I never drink coffee so this is
gonna be my first time trying Starbucks
Coffee you know well I actually quite
like it to be honest the cost of one was
a little bit sweeter than this one this
was a little bit won't be tired
he has just would be extra witty I got a
grande is higher yet
I'm never gonna take loads of selfies
and you don't you post on the ground
because I am channeling my inner
government today is Tuesday and this is
my outfit of the day I feel like I did a
pretty good job with trying to recreate
her outfit from her new a music video
and note is enough to cry but she's
wearing like this really pretty polka
dot sort of baby doll dress I couldn't
actually find anything that similar to
it so I'm at your Wang asker and another
dress underneath as you can see to make
it a little bit more poofy like her so
whilst I've got this outfit on and my
hair like this today I thought it might
be quite fun to try and recreate her
album cover four note is enough to cry
where she's got like the whole rainbow
on her cheek I think it would be so much
fun trying to recreate that photo so
let's go upstairs into the studio and go
and recreate the photo then I'll go to
my studio we just set up the camera and
we're going to be taking a couple of
photos to try and recreate this photo
right here
so that was actually a lot quicker than
I thought it would take the photo was
super easy as she's literally just
staring straight into nothingness so I
really enjoyed taking that photo and I
hope I did it justice so this is how my
photo turned out compared to the
original I probably did a pretty good
job with it I mean the only thing that's
kind of different is the fact that my
ear isn't out but that's only because if
I do it my wig is literally hurting my
ears so bad and it just kind of like
flops over the wig and it's not a good
look so I'm just gonna tuck my ear back
in but yeah I really enjoyed this photo
and obviously I photoshopped the little
like rainbow on her cheek as I wasn't
gonna do that with makeup
notice I don't really know what they
used to actually do that whole rainbow
thing I'm pretty sure they must have
done it in Photoshop I was not prepared
to do it with makeup cuz I feel like
that would have taken ages so I just did
mine in Photoshop and I feel like it
turned out pretty good
it is now Wednesday and today I am
sporting at the brown head ariana grande
look I honestly feel like her brown hair
is like absolutely iconic so I just
needed to do at least one look with the
brown hair so today's look is inspired
by her everyday music video where she's
wearing like a Rudi nice just like a
plain simple tank top with this really
cute like Navy oversized puffer jacket
and then for my bottom half I flipped it
has got a pair of jeans and that is
pretty much the look I then just popped
my wig into like two little twin buns
which i think is so adorable
I actually did a whole makeup tutorial
from that music video like last year
I'll link it down below if you guys want
to check it out it's super embarrassing
but this is pretty much kind of what it
looked like so today I actually thought
it would be quite fun to test out some
ariana grande products just because she
actually does quite a few different
products like she has a perfume line she
did have a collaboration with Mac and
she's had a collaboration with lip seed
so I thought I'd be really fun to
basically you just take at those items
and put it to the test okay so the very
first item that I'm gonna be testing out
today is this a perfume by ariana grande
I think this is one of her newest
perfumes it's called a moon light and I
don't think I have actually smelled any
are
grandi products before so this is what
the box looks like I think it's really
really cute right let's crack this over
oh look at that I know that like these
pom-poms are kind of like her staying
like she has a pom-pom on pretty much
all her perfume so I really really like
that and the bottle is absolutely
gorgeous I feel like it kind of looks
like a crystal it's so beautiful okay so
I'm just gonna spritz this all over well
that was a lot that smells so nice
though it's like really sweet and kind
of fruity as well definitely giving this
a big thumbs up really like it now the
next product I'm gonna test out is her
lipstick collaboration with Mac I
actually managed to get my hands on like
one of the last lipstick I know she had
to buy on eBay cuz they're also now I
think this is quite an old collaboration
as well so it was really hard to get my
hands on this but I managed it this is
what the packaging looks like it's a
little bit squished but it looks really
cute now the actual lipstick is in the
shade of Viva Glam ariana grande - so
this is what it looks like it's the
purple one and this is what the actual
lipstick looks like it's such a pretty
vibrant pink color also don't mind the
fact that I've got eyeliner on my hand
I'm so clumsy I love this lipstick it's
definitely really out there not
something I would usually wear but let's
give it a try this is really creamy that
is a cute I actually really liked it I
thought this was gonna be a lot less
wearable but it actually looks really
nice in the very last two at products I
thought I would try our collaboration
with lip see which I actually managed to
get my hands on from a sauce these are
all pretty much sold out I couldn't even
manage to get my proper size so these
are probably gonna be a little bit too
big for me the first up we have at this
little dresser right here so let's crack
this open and have a look okay here we
go it's kind of hard to show but it's
basically like a lace cutout sort of
dress the fabric is really nice like the
lace is really good-quality I mean let's
try it on and see how it looks so this
is the first dress I actually really
like here like I said
a little bit big for me so I would have
to kind of like hold it up to see how it
would actually look if it was my size
but I actually really like this I think
it's so cute and girly I do kind of wish
that this lace pattern was a little bit
higher like this I think that we look a
lot better but overall this dress is so
cute and garlic and now for the second
dress this is it so basically it's like
a nude cutout kind of dress yet again
it's got this little like cutouts on the
belly I like the fact that this is body
conch but I have to say this is a size
14 I'm usually a size 8 so this is gonna
look a lot bigger on me but let's just
try it on anyways and this is what the
second dress looks like on again it's a
little bit big around this area here so
I'm just gonna cinch in to kind of show
you guys how it would look this is
basically the gist of it I actually
really like this I love the fabric I
love the color and I think these little
cutouts here are so feminine and cute so
I'm gonna give this restaurant I am
actually really digging at this hair
color let me know if you prefer ariana
grande with her blonde hair or with this
hair color because I feel like this one
is just so iconic so today is Thursday
now for Thursday I thought I would kind
of put together more of a sporty look
that Ariana has won before so this is
kind of inspired by her look from her
Reebok shoe so I'm wearing actually the
exact same sports bra that she had over
in the photo my hair is a little bit
different just because my wig can not do
a high ponytail but this is the original
photo that inspired me up for this look
she was wearing with this really weird
like leathery sort of jacket it's maybe
like a lot of wicked sounds but
basically I thought today I would do a
little work out since I do actually have
a home gym I am very bad at working out
though so please don't judge so first up
I'm getting on the treadmill now this is
gonna be super weird because I have
never actually worked out with a wig on
and also a full face of makeup so wish
me life
wait this is slow difficult so whilst I
was on the treadmill I found that the
sports bra I'm wearing is actually quite
supportive so I would recommend I'll
leave a link down below if you guys want
to get it because it is the exact same
one that I was writing in her photo and
we'll be doing this so Rob hi guys so
today is a Friday today is sadly the
last day of me turning myself into
ariana grande for a week but honestly I
had the best time ever I really hope you
guys have been enjoying seeing all the
different outfits today's look is
actually inspired by a look from her
music video notice left to cry where
she's got like really glam sort of
makeup which I tried to recreate today
and this is my outfit so I basically
just picked up this silver sort of dress
that I feel like looked quite a bit like
her dress from the music video and it's
my shoes I've just got these a little a
silver heels on which I absolutely love
so since today is my last day of living
and my life is ariana grande I thought I
would actually prepare a vegan meal for
lunch since ariana is actually begun I
personally am vegetarian but I'm 99%
like plant-based anyway so this is just
the meal that I really like to cook
myself I'm not the greatest cook I have
to say so today I'm just picking some
bang bang cauliflower and some wok fried
greens vs. sauce and then I'm just
having some noodles on the side it's a
really simple meal but I really like it
so I've just popped in the sauce and oh
my god it looks so good already
okay so food is now done oh my god it
looks so good and I'm just having some
melon water on the side however I feel
like a really overdressed for the
occasion somebody should just having a
lunch at home I can't wait to eat this
this is the moment I've been waiting for
for the whole week and that is to take
this down wiggle so as I said in my
Kylie video previously this video is
obviously not to be taken seriously it
was just for fun I am a hundred percent
okay with who I am personally and I want
to touch on that message again like I
did in the previous video I really hope
that all of you guys know that every
single one of you is so beautiful just

change and be like anyone else because
