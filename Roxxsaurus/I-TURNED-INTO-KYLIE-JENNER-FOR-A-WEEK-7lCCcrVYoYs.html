back to my channel so in today's video I
am gonna be doing something a little bit
different so unless you've been living
under a rock for a little while you'll
know that the Kardashian / jenna family
are pretty much one of the most famous
families in the world so I thought it
would be a really good idea to try and
turn myself into you Kylie Jenner for a
week
yep I don't even know how I came up with
this idea and of course this video is
just for fun please don't take this
video too seriously I just thought it'd
be really fun to basically try and
experience Kylie sort of lifestyle and
just basically like go out in public
each day in a different outfit and kind
of transform myself to look a little bit
more like Kylie and get people's
reactions if you guys are branding here
and have never seen my face before and
make sure you come and join the dinosaur
family by subscribing down below but
without further ado let's get on into
the video operations how my system to
kindly step one get them clothes so guys
I've been doing this for like an hour
and I have done the damage I've made an
order that came up to 426 pounds so uh
let's hope the outfits are at least any
good three days later okay I mean this
should do operation time us up in the
Kylie face to is get that tan
unfortunately because I live in a very
gloomy England we don't really get to
see much Sun so I'm gonna be piling on
the fake tan to get that golden goddess
look but cut you've got by the way I
haven't even used this like in a year so
which me like oh my god this is so tough
let's blend this out real quick please
don't go patchy please so I'm really
weird like when my hair is is this meant
to happen okay so now that my tan is
developing I feel like I'm slightly
closer to Kylie's like skin tone now I
do
blue eyes though so I do need to put
some contact lenses in it to make my
eyes are brown so this is okay well hey
we have finally got the contacts in I'm
now gonna do my makeup to make myself
look a little bit more bronzed on the
face as on my face it does not match my
skin right now so the makeup I
personally do not have a Mario to do my
makeup like the Kardashians and Jenna's
do so I'll be doing my makeup by myself
cuz that's how we roll on this camera to
transform myself into Kylie I'm gonna be
doing it one of her like famous looks
that she always does and it's like a
really bronzy sort of look I have never
worn a foundation this dark in my whole
life so this is gonna be definitely
interested if this is so orange on my
skin I'm really hoping this is gonna
blend out well tension I'm gonna need
you to face fine don't once smoke with
me this is a late lunch
let's check each hand weight pulling
fixed on my crown won't fit please okay
so now my makeup is finished it looks so
so different than what I usually do do I
look more like Kylie if not maybe this
will have bocce
you can't kiss it that slats though I
don't work in the office they copy in
the nest back though so the wig is now
on and honestly I feel like I have the
biggest head right now so please excuse
that but let's get into the first outfit
so guys today is my first day living as
a new woman Kylie Jenner so this is the
outfit for the first day and this is
actually a dress from a pretty little
thing which I've already managed to
spill water on so this actual dress was
on Kylie's Instagram she wore and
promoted it so I thought you know might
as well pick it up and see if it
actually fits admittedly I do think it
looks a lot better on her because I
don't know if you guys can see but it's
got like really weird straps right here
that just don't look like they sit
properly maybe it's just because my
chest is too small I don't really know
they've also got some fake cartel
bracelets from eBay because Kylie
usually has a few of them stacked on her
arm honestly how are must probably be
worth like 60 grand but mine what every
time so bougie and a bunch of anyways
now that I've got my new look let's head
out and get some food motorsport
like Kardashians and generally they only
eat salad on the you know keeping our
car - okay so it's so for looking and
quick update though these two girls that
were probably about my age and one of
them said to the other
oh my god that looks like guys just so
hilarious because this is exactly what
I'm trying to do okay so we made it to
the southern part now I'm kind of hungry
I don't usually eat salad I mean I'm
vegetarian but like like salads are just
not already the one like I don't ever
really choose to eat salad which I feel
like it's such a misconception when it
comes to vegetarians like people just
think oh he is a leaves or something
well that's alright we're going to get
something bigger I don't know
all the other stuff okay so I found a
larger salad which is this and it's
actually got falafel in it which is so
young but there's a lot in here that I
actually don't usually eat like there's
a lot of leaves but just don't let me do
it for me but I bet it's really healthy
okay so we have just had the salad and
jaren actually has a little story
those who are walking around like
everyone's looking and we just over here
at the corner of my eye son of my own oh
there's so much for lighting people's
reactions because people obviously can
tell ya if you ou can obviously tell
that I'm trying to cover like Kylie
Jenner Wiley's all of the Kardashians
we're gonna head back home now and I'm
gonna snatch this wig off because I am
getting a headache from it and also the
lashes are so uncomfortable like I'm
telling you guys I could not wear lashes
every single day like no way so another
day another Kylie Jenner impostor like
today's look is actually inspired by and
this photo right here which is basically
a outfit that she's wearing like a
jumper dress with some black heels that
have like spots all over them however I
wasn't actually able to find any heels
that had like white spots
they were probably designer and very
bougie so I just got some plain heels
and basically this is my outfit it's
very simple but it's kind of like kind
of casual but kind of cute I really
really like these heels are so cool so
today I actually think I'm just gonna go
and grab a coffee now coffees are
something I really don't drink for I
know that Kylie is quite in the coffee
drinker so I thought I'd just pop into
cluster and grab a coffee just to try it
and see if I even like it so we have
made it to pasta and we order two
coffees now I have to say I've never
actually had like proper coffee before
let's try it for the first time I'm
probably gonna hate this to be honest
but we'll see
hmm actually a lot bad you know I'm
trying to test like a really bits of hot
chocolate almost Stephanie attest that
I'm not really familiar with I think I
could get used to this okay so I have
finished my coffee and I actually have
to say it wasn't as bad as I thought it
would be now you guys know I don't
really drink coffee too much but I'm not
sure really surprising myself I finished
pretty much all of it and I probably
would drink it again so it is a
Wednesday day number three over my
living life as Kylie and today I
basically thought I would get my nails
done because I know that Kylie always
has her nails on point
however my nails are all broken and
chipped so I'm gonna go to the nail
salon and hopefully get my nails done
with like a really cool Kylie inspired
pattern so I just got my nails done and
this is what they look like they are
basically inspired by like the drip on
Kylie lip kits but I got them to match
my outfit by the way this is actually my
outfit it's kind of like all nude and
it's inspired by this photo right here
of Kylie now I wasn't actually able to
get like the exact same colors and the
exact same items but I still think the
outfit looks pretty close now this is
something I don't usually wear like the
sort of outfit is kind of out there for
me but it's quite nice to try it and I
love my nails
so it is now Thursday and this is the
look of today I'm just wearing a pretty
little thing sports bra with some
leggings this is actually a look that
Kylie has sported on her Instagram and
this is the inspiration however she
didn't wear underwear in her picture
which I wasn't exactly gonna do for the
whole day so I just paired it with some
leggings and this is what the whole
outfit looks like it's like a very
casual sort of lounging day for me today
and seeing as we're almost coming up to
the end of the week I thought it would
be quite nice to do a little review of
some of my Instagram comments at the
moment as I haven't posted quite a few
in stuff Oto's of my few looks for the
past couple of days and a lot of you are
saying that this look really suits me
like I'll pop in some comments right now
you guys are so nice and I loved reading
all of the comments a lobby was shocked
to see me with black hair and a lot of
you have been saying that I look
completely different which I totally
agree I don't think I would ever dye my
hair this color I was quite a few of you
guys who actually thought that this was
my real hair color and I actually dyed
it which is just insane because I didn't
think I could ever do my hair black and
loads of you were saying things like oh
my god I missed the old Roxy literally
after two photos of me posting in my
hair color like this so don't worry guys
I am still the same Roxy I am definitely
not gonna change my hair to this color
and this is 100% a wig but it has been
super interesting to seeing your
reaction because a lot of you guys were
just scrolling through Instagram and did
not expect me to have black hair and
then you're like who's that so thank you
so much for commenting on all of the
photos and following me on instagram if
you guys don't follow my Instagram
already then what are you doing and that
is the question go follow it right now
today is the last day of my life as
Kylie Jenner what do you think of my
little win so I just saw distance myself
a little badminton walk ahead a little
bit I mean I think it's like yeah I feel
like if they have a god-like sport it
would be a lot more natural and these
heels are wearing today and the contacts
are they weird as well as strong I
honestly feel like this whole week is
very difficult because I had to do my
makeup so on point every day I do you
know it's not a lot every day yeah it
was quite difficult and I'm wearing
flashes every day in contact so yeah it
was fun to try so this is all my life
has consisted off for the past five days
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video but I am so ready to just snatch
this wig right up it has honestly been
really really fun at trying out a whole
new look however I want to take this
opportunity to just point out that I
obviously did this for fun like I have
read some comments of you guys saying
that you feel that I'm trying to be
someone else I just want to say to
anyone out there who may be feeling like
they need to try and be someone else do
not do that like I said this video was
just for fine I am NOT trying to be
anyone else but me I am more than happy
with it being Who I am so I just want to
spread that message to you guys as well
because I know that it's quite difficult
when you see people like Kylie Jenner on
social media and you kind of compare
yourself a little bit I know we all do
err and it's just kind of toxic I think
everyone goes on about it all the time
but it's definitely a really important
message that I want to convey through
this video that although I was trying to
turn myself into Kylie Jenner I do not
want to be anyone else but me and I
think you should all kind of live your
life in the same way as well I just want
all of you guys to be happy and just
accept who you are there is no reason
that you should change that there is
definitely nothing wrong with trying at
new lives and just having fun at which i
think is really really important as well
just to be able to express yourself I
think doing these five Kylie looks over
the past week have definitely made me
realize them
and everyone around me we're all just
like realizing things just from doing
this video I have found how crazy it is
to just change your eye color and your
hair and you literally look like a
completely different person this week
has been kind of hard in many ways
because it was quite embarrassing to go
out in public with a wig that literally
looked nothing like me I felt like I had
like a secret identity slash persona
almost and then also obviously the eye
situation the contact lenses to change
my eye color as well as the lashes have
not been the most comfortable and they
have not cooperated but the majority of
this week these lashes have just been
trying to and stick and they almost have
a mind of their own I think so I
definitely feel like I could not wear
lashes every single day or even eyelash
extensions they're just not they're just
not for me I think in general from the
past week of dressing a lot differently
and just doing a lot of things that I
don't usually do on an everyday basis I
have definitely felt really strange like
I think that I felt a lot more like this
center of attention a lot of the times
like wherever I went I would just get
lots of looks especially the first day
when I went to mr. village and I was
wearing the pretty little thing dress
that Kylie wore I feel like a lot of
people were looking at me really strange
and some people like I said in the video
were even saying oh my god she looks
like Kylie which was really really cool
but also kind of weird so that was
basically it for this video I really
hope you guys found it entertaining more
than anything like I said this video is
not to be taken seriously but if you
guys do want to check out all of the
photos that I have taken on each of the
days I have posted them all on my
Instagram and will continue to do so
after this video is released so that you
guys can check those looks out and I
also have the clothing links in the
description in case you guys are
interested in any of the outfits that I
wore in this video this video does well
and you guys enjoy it I might consider
doing another one with like a different
celebrity maybe like Gigi Hadid or
something do let me know in the comments
who else you would like me to turn into
for a whole week I have worked so super
hard on this video so I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and if you did make sure
you smash that huge stuff left us down
below and also don't forget to subscribe

from me thank you so much for watching
