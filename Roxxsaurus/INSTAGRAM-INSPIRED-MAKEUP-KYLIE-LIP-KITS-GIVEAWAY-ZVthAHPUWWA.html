well today I've got this really kind of
out there but also quite wearable makeup
look inspired by Instagram I absolutely
love Instagram and I see so many
beautiful makeup blogs on that social
media so I thought I would kind of pull
together all the different images that I
find and I love and basically hybrid
those and create this Instagram inspired
makeup look before I come straight into
the makeup tutorial the lip color I'm
wearing is actually Dolce K by Kylie
cosmetics and I'm actually hosting a
giveaway for the Kylie lip kit and I'm
giving away candy K this is brand new
not open or anything I haven't watched
it when I was picking up my Kylie lip
kit I thought I would get one for one of
you guys because I appreciate you guys
so much so make sure you stay till the
end so to find out how to win this bad
boy don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoy it and subscribe
to this channel as well as my blog
Channel at Rock Sora's blogs but without
happening let's go raise the story so
for my base today I'm using your Giorgio
Armani moisture foundation and I'm
applying that mostly in the center of my
face where I get the most redness this
foundation is amazing for people with
dry skin and it gives you skin that
flawless finish to consumer under-eye
circles and any blemishes I'm gonna be
reaching for the Rimmel wake me up
concealer this is one of my favorite
concealers it's so highly pigmented and
it's really good for its price and to
blend that out I'm using my etude house
brush this is basically the cheaper
alternative of the our teeth brush not
to bronze up the face a little bit i'm
using the Maestri liquid summer bronzer
by Giorgio Armani and this is so good
this literally blends in like a dream
and I have recently loved using this so
much it just gives you that really nice
natural sunkissed look to your face
so I'm blending this in a sea motion
from my cheekbones to my temple I'm then
reaching for my bare minerals a
translucent powder and I'm just applying
that underneath my eyes up to my cheek
bone just to basically highlight that
area a little bit next it's time to
focus on the brows so for this I'm using
my Anastasia brow pomade in shade blonde
and I'm base
we focusing this on the arch of my
eyebrow as well as at the beginning of
my brows and this product also lightens
my brows which is good because my brows
are quite dark compared to my hair after
blush I'm using the major blush by soap
&amp;amp; Glory
in shade rosy chic and I'm just applying
this to the apples of my cheeks to add a
bit of color to my face to highlight my
cheekbones I'm using the bodyshop
lightining touch and this is a really
great product to give your face at that
luminous effect so I'm just popping that
on my cheekbones and the tip of my nose
and then I'm blending this out with the
warmth of my finger now we're not done
for highlight we're gonna add even a lot
highlight because you guys all know I
love highlight so I'm using the sleek
softest highlighting palette and I'm
using the purple shade and basically the
base highlight acts as an adhesive for
this second highlight which makes it
last longer maybe those are the eyes I'm
gonna be using my Too Faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette and I'm reaching
for this first shade called mousse and
I'm blending this into my crease as a
transition shade with a zoeva brush the
next step is using a darker shade into
the crease and i'm using pudding and
this is a slightly darker cool toned
brown and this shade basic it adds that
little bit more definition to the eye
socket I'm also blending this quite low
on the lower lash line to give the eyes
that smokey effect
I'm now taking this light beige shade
and I'm basically using this to diffuse
all the colors together through the
crease and the last trade I'm using is
hot fudge and this is basically the
shade that we're gonna put all over the
lid this is the darkest shade that we're
using on the eyes today and it's got a
slight shimmer to it which you actually
can't see that much to finish off the
eye shadow I'm reaching for my Avon
mirror shine eye pencil and I'm popping
that into the inner corner as well as my
brow bone to add a little pop of
highlight now to line my eyes I'm using
the super cat felt tip liner by soap &amp;amp;
Glory and I'm creating a winged liner
with this I feel like the winged liner
is a must when you're creating an
Instagram makeup look so I'm just
creating a subtle one because we are
gonna be adding some lashes afterwards
now for mascara I'm using the YSL vinyl
mascara this mascara has a great formula
because unlike most mascaras this one
doesn't actually crumble off of your
eyelashes it really separates the lashes
as well which is always good so I'm
applying that to the top and bottom
lashes now for the lips I'm using the
Kylie cosmetics lip kits and I'm using
the Dolce K lip liner first just to over
line my lips slightly and I'm filling
the whole lip in with Dolce K and liquid
lipstick these smell so good and it's
not as drying as I thought it would be I
mean it is of course drying it is a
matte liquid lipstick but at the end of
the day it's very long-lasting so as
long as you've got moisturize lips you
will be fine
and that is the final look I hope you
guys like it and now it's time for the
giveaway of the Kylie lip kit in shade
Kandy K so basically in this giveaway is
