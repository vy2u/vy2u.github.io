channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far so today's video
that's here really exciting one because
I finally get to real to you guys my
first ever collaboration with Maybelline
New York for a little while now I've
been working super hard to design a
range of bold lipsticks for you guys and
I've been really involved in the process
from choosing what lipstick shades
should go in the range all the way down
to actually designing the packaging
which I actually Illustrated myself but
this is the moment we've all been
waiting for here are the lipstick there
are five bold matte shades in this range
and you guys are going to love them but
contrary to what you think about the
bold lip I feel like these are perfect
for summer it really kind of like spices
up your lip and I'm going to show you
guys exactly how you can rock these in
the summer with like different looks you
match each of the lipsticks so you guys
can pick these lipsticks up in Superdrug
exclusively on the 31st of May that's
the launch day and you're going to be
sold across the UK only and they are
going to be in stores for only one month
so you guys have to be quite quick on it
because they are limited edition meaning
they'll be selling out quite quickly so
if you guys really grabbed one make sure
you guys pop into your local like super
drive and pick one up on the 31st of May
I personally think that this summer's
trend should definitely be wearing bold
dark lipstick and just be a little bit
more daring with your luxe because why
not by the way if you guys don't follow
my daily vlogging channel rocks or as
ones you totally should because I
actually love behind the scenes all my
photo shoot for the pictures are going
to be in super drawers on my little
Maybelline stall with these lipsticks oh
I realize that a few of these lipsticks
such as the two blue shades they're a
little bit more daring and might be out
of a lot of people's comfort zone but
don't worry guys I'm going to show you
what kind of list you could pair with
these lipsticks to make it a little bit
more wearable and fun for summer and
hopefully this will give you some
inspiration to power these lipsticks
diamond vixen is the first shade which
is this lovely purple toned of fuchsia
shade it is quite a bold color and I
like to keep the eyes quite minimum but
tie in a purple tone through the crease
ever so slightly you can then finish off
this local with a thin winged liner and
you are good to go
the second lipstick is in shade gone
grey and it
very wearable news that is one of my
favorites I think you can pair this one
with any look really as it's quite a
muted color for every day I like to let
it color with a bold brown tone to
smokey eye and finish it off with a
winged liner the next shade in the range
is blackest berry this is a very
gorgeous maroon kind of color that I
love to wear a lot in the autumn and
winter seasons because it is one of my
favorite tones of lipstick to wear on my
lips why not just wear it in the summer
too I love the latest kind of color with
every thick and sharp graphic kind of
winged liner and fluttery lashes i zoom
this really balances out the look and
complements it really nicely next up is
sapphire siren this is such a beautiful
royal blue color which I have been
loving recently I think this one is such
a fun shade to wear during the summer
and I like to pair the shade was quite a
minimum I look I think adding slight
definition through the crease was a
matte brown shadow and some mascara is
enough to make the lips the center of
attention the last color is midnight
blue this is the darkest shade of the
range and the name fits it perfectly I
realize that this one may be a bit out
of people's comfort zone so you can
easily make this lipstick more wearable
and fun by creating an ombre effect by
disturbing a bit of sapphire siren in
the very center of the lips now for the
eyes I like to add a lot of light to
them because the lipstick is quite dark
so I'm going to be taking this shimmery
champagne kind of shadow and add this in
the inner corner brow bone also on the
lid and I'm also even going to use this
as a highlight to just tie the whole
look together I feel like adding a lot
of light to the face really distract
from the darkness of the lipstick and
makes it so much more wearable so these
are the five different looks that I like
to create to make these lipsticks
wearable for summer I really hope you
guys a lovely shade as much as I do and
I really hope I get to see you guys
wearing these or like Twitter and
Instagram if you guys purchasing make
sure you tag me and Maybelline so we can
see let me know your favorite lipstick
shade out of these I feel like a
one is going to love the gone bracelet
stickers it's such a nice nudey brown
kind of color it's literally my favorite
I also really love a vivid vixen and
sapphire siren to be fair I just love
them all I don't think I can have a
favor I'm literally so happy I get to
finally reveal these lips 16 guys
because it's just slowly placing like I
can't believe I've had this opportunity
to actually design it the packaging
because you guys know I'm an illustrator
so this is like a dream come true so yes
a huge thank you to make the lien for
making this happy for me and thanks to
you guys because without you this
wouldn't be possible right yes I'm going
to wrap it up here I already hope you
