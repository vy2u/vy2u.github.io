back to my channel
so as you can tell by the title today
I'm going to be doing something slightly
different than usual we're gonna be
doing a reacting video to jenna Marbles
video because she basically just posted
a video trying to recreate one of my
Halloween looks from last year you guys
haven't seen it then this is the look
that I did it's kind of like her optical
illusion sort of look that's before we
get any further into this video I just
want to clarify that my jumper says
snatched not like natch or something if
you're wondering this is from H&amp;amp;M I'll
link it down below but yes we're gonna
be reacting to this video today and I'm
so excited
I watched Jennifer ages like since I was
a kid so to see how like recreate one of
my looks it was just so cool I just Kim
watched this video like I haven't
actually fully watched it yet because I
really wanted to film this video for you
guys so we're kind of gonna be seeing it
together almost for the first time so I
have my laptop right here at the ready
so we can watch this video together if
you guys are brand new make sure you
come and join the dinosaur family by
subscribing down below but without
further ado let's get on into the video
this has probably been one of the most
requested videos in recent memory
correct me in the comments if I'm wrong
but I think dope to one-one-one
pioneered this look oh she did looks
like a set of eyes under her eyes I love
promised funds look like this was the
thing that kind of like inspired me to
do like all the eyes on my face so I
just love her so much as well looks
under her lips it's a double vision
makeup look and you guys just flooded me
with tweets and stuff when this came out
and you said that you really wanted me
to do it
I know it's taken me a minute okay but I
think I'm gonna do it but I found it's
by Roxas Soros I love the way she says
my channel name Roxas auras like it's
actually rock soros for those of you who
don't know like it's not Roxas auras but
there's so many people that make the
same mistake and funny story my channel
was actually meant to be Roxas auras but
when I was making the channel I actually
made a spelling mistake so now it's
rocks auras but it's kind of stuck so
we're all going with a true vision
illusion Halloween makeup and she has
not two sets of eyes but device - oh
it's full
but there's so many eyes that I can kind
of see why she would get confused down
here so you just look like a human
spider I do have to say is definitely
one of my harder looks like I don't
think it's like a beginner friends like
I'm not gonna lie I tried to obviously
make the tutorial as like I don't know
step by step as possible but there's
gonna be some things that some people
may struggle with obviously so I'm kind
of excited to see how Jenna's gonna do
with this like creepy old lady eyes I'm
really not having a great yeah great yo
Lydia's is a place on my right oh my god
so what I was doing there is it was so
uncomfortable I kind of actually never
said this in the video but it was really
uncomfortable because I had like a
pencil that was really super hard and
stiff so when I was like trying to do
the eyebrow under my eye I was like
dragging my skin it was so painful I'll
link the video in the description for
those of y'all that actually want to
watch someone talented so then she
starts like outlining the eye underneath
to do free well I'm terrified to fail at
this cuz then it's still ruined the
I love journeys like little side
comments that all live is like puns oh
man that looks good yeah cuz then the
ones up here bigger
they are zoom I'm not that artistic like
I can't fucking draw honestly Jenna
between the shots this was kind of what
I was like as well like I was just like
oh this is not working this didn't go my
way
honestly it's just like a trial and
error it takes it took me a long time to
film that I'm not gonna lie that's such
a good idea I'm still exists oh my god
the way they say omegle like in England
it's omegle like that's what we say but
I didn't realize it's omegle like which
one is it is it omegle or is it omegle
let me know down below if you don't stop
you start sweating my eyes off that's
some good shading Jenna dye is some good
shape it's actually looking ready to go
like once you put the white bit inside
the eye it starts to look like so much
like eyes yeah cuz my a mostly pencil it
is harder and even what's that look like
that's all that I didn't bring down a
teal lipstick oh no my top eyes a
cookout
that's happened to me as well when I
first did this like the eyes when I
should just point in different
directions because of the coverture of
like a full head don't worry y'all that
happened to me as when I was little I
really wanted brown eyes because I feel
like you come where like almost no
makeup and your eyes just sort of stand
out but not me I just had these like
light eyes light skin it just look dead
guys made I wish I had brown eyes like
so bad you lookin good too I should put
on lashes
eyes and make everyone a laughs if they
are allegedly pointing in the opposite
direction she's got this like liquid
white eyeliner that I just do not have
oh the liquid eyeliner let me tell you
that is like one step that I definitely
wouldn't miss because it just brings the
whole thing to life like it makes it
look three-dimensional it makes like the
eyes look like they're almost like
glistening so yeah it's definitely
really good to have like a white liquid
liner for this look because I feel like
it just makes it ten times better
it's looking really good though the nose
needs to go right open my nose sky this
was literally the dip like the most
difficult part of this video I think
don't zoom in on me you just call it in
my scar Jordan has come to save the day
that is wild it's not right so now the
question is should I put lashes on my
face or not artists see I like I think
it would have been really really good if
she had a white eyeliner like that would
definitely complete the look but I think
it still looks pretty good
lip ception dang my lips as small as
hell you don't have a lot to draw make
sure you me it doesn't look as cursory
that's why I'm people like oh my god you
have to do this I'm like it only looks
good cuz they're credibly good at makeup
must really not that good he doesn't
want to be a story here's my first set
of eyes my second inside of a tease my
third set of eyes my fourth set of eyes
oh my god that looks really scary
that looks really scary oh my god that
was such a good video I really enjoyed
that and honestly I don't feel like she
did that bad of a job like I feel like
she did actually okay like I said like
the eyeliner the white eyeliner would
have definitely saved the day because
for me but honestly I just don't think
it was that bad I definitely think she
was being too hard on myself but anyways
I really hope you guys enjoyed my
