Jenner we all know and love Kylie
Jenner's makeup and I thought I would
create one of her like most typical
looks that she wears quite a lot so I
thought I'll just recreate one of the
smokey gold eyes head with her signature
amore
let's if you guys would like to see how
I created this makeup look then just
keep on watching
so I've already applied my base just to
say that it's a bit of time and firstly
I applied my favorite moisturizer which
is the skin repair light moisturizer by
this L and then for my foundation I use
the luminous silk foundation by Giorgio
Armani I'm now going to move straight
into contouring and we all know that
Kylie Jenner and all of the Jenner's and
Kardashians are famous for their
contours and their really glowy and
bronzed complexion so to kind of
recreate that I'm gonna be using my
L'Oreal infallible sculpt contour kits
and I'm gonna be applying this with my
Real Techniques contour brush you can
have some of that product and I'm going
to be contouring in the hollows of my
cheek bone and I'm slightly bringing
that contour Apple to my cheekbone to
lift my cheekbone a little bit I'm
working this product in in circular
motions to get a really seamless blend
that looks quite natural and then I'm
dragging that product onto my temple and
the top of my forehead as well I'm also
going to be contouring the tip of my
nose but for this I'm using a smaller
brush and I'm using at this luxe crease
brush by Ziva having a smaller brush for
the nose contour it's just going to give
you that little bit more precision when
you're working in the product
so now moving on to the ice I'm going to
be reaching it for my Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion and this is the
anti-aging one I'm just going to pop
that over my lids to kind of prep them
for all the eyeshadow to come okay so
first things first I'm going to be
laying down my base shadow and the
palette I'm using is the Gwen Stefani
and urban decay one and I am going to be
reaching for the shadow Stark which is
this one here it's just like an all-over
base shadow and I'm just applying that
with my fluffy brush from as a weaver
and then I'm going to be building up on
that shade and deepening up the crease a
little bit with the shadow zone which is
this darker Brown shadow here and I'm
really lightly picking that up on my
brush dusting it off and then just
blending that through the crease and I'm
trying to focus the pigment on at the
very outer corner kind of sweeping it
into the middle I'm now going to be
switching up my palette for the new
titude by the balm because I'm looking
for a little bit of a darker brown shade
and this palette has the perfect one so
I'm gonna be using a sleek which is this
dark matte brown shadow here so I'm
picking up this smaller fluffy brush and
this is from a Rimmel and I'm picking up
that sleek shadow and just really
focusing that into the hollow of my
crease
I'm also blending it down into the outer
corner and they're kind of feathering
that pigment out towards the center of
my lid now I'm just reaching back for
wiser leave a blending brush and I'm
just going to blend any harsh edges out
so now I'm just going to repeat the very
same to the other eye I'm still going to
be returning back to my gwen palette to
pick up the base shadow that we first
meet you and this is going to help us
blend out the crease shadow I'm not
going to be using the shadow blonde from
the Urban Decay palette and I'm eating
basically the smoky shader to apply this
to kind of lighten that the little
portion of my lid and this are just
basically prepping it for a gold pigment
to go over the top I'm also going to be
dragging that shadow up into the brow
bone to highlight it and now to finish
off the eye shadow I'm picking up my
sleek makeup palette and this isn't the
I lost a shadow palette from the 24
karat gold collection so firstly I'm
picking up this shade called Lewis I'm
picking up on my smoky shader from zoeva
and just applying it over that middle
portion of our eyelid again and because
this shadow has quite a creamy
consistency it's gonna act as a primer
almost for the shower that I'm gonna
apply it afterwards and it's got a
really gorgeous sparkle in it as well
you could almost wear this eyeshadow
just like its own I'm also gonna pull
that in in the corner a little bit as
well another last shadow that we're
going to be applying is the gold one and
this is in shade Avera this one is
actually very similar to the one that
she's using in the photo that I'm using
is reference so I'm just applying that
again in the middle portion of my eye
I'm packing that color on rather than
swiping it because we want it to be
really pigmented
I'm now just going back in with the
shadow zone from the gwon Paulo just to
go over any harsh edges or through the
crease and I'm also going to try and
blend at the outer corner with legal
shadow just so that we get a really nice
seamless blend I'm now returning back to
my room or fluffy brush and I'm taking
the shadow zone again and just running
that along my lower lash line in the
makeup she's also got a little bit of
gold running through her lower lash line
so I'm definitely gonna add that little
bit in and for this I'm gonna be
returning back to this sleek palette and
picking up that same gold shadow in
shade Vera it's gonna be running that
through the lower lash line ever so
slightly just in the very center now in
terms of eyeliner she hasn't got
anything crazy but she has got a slight
flick to your eyeliner did you recreate
that flick I'm gonna be using one of my
favorite eyeliners and this is it the
Schwing by the balm and now come on this
far I'm not gonna be applying mascara to
my top lashes because I've got lash
extensions on but for my bottom lashes
I'm going to be using the combo of the
Urban Decay super version lash primer
and the Urban Decay perversion of
mascara and also fill my eyebrows in
having an amazing and this eyebrow
pencil by IQ and beauty this is like a
no-name brand but it's actually a really
good eye brow pencil and it matches my
hair really nicely because it's quite a
cool tone shade I don't really know
where they sell this pencil but I'm sure
you could probably find it online
somewhere I'll pop the name of all the
products I've used in this video down
but I have just as any who are
interested now for blush Kylie in the
makeup look that I'm recreating is
wearing quite a pinky blush so I'm gonna
be reaching for my other decay Gwen
Stefani blush palette and I'm going
using this shade called
easy and it's a really gorgeous dark
pink shadow with a little bit of gold
shimmer going through it and she has her
blush going up quite high rather than
focusing the blush on the apple of her
cheek she's kind of got her blush going
all the way up to her temple almost and
lastly for her lip the lipstick that
she's wearing is like a light pink II
kind of shade so firstly I'm going to be
lining my lips a little bit with a Mac
spice and then I'm going to be applying
a Mac faux to the whole of my lip with a
little lip brush and this has got quite
a like purple and dark undertone to it
but we're going to be lightining this up
with another shade and now to finish the
lip off I'm going in with blankety by
Mac so that is all for my Kylie Jenner
