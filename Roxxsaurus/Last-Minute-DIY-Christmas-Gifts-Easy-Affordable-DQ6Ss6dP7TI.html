except I'm not that man ho ho it's
Christmas hi guys today I'm gonna be
filming a Christmas DIY as you can tell
from their titles I'm gonna be showing
you how to create four different gift
ideas that I've seen around the internet
like on Pinterest or tumblr including
these really cool wintery coasters and
also this amazing snowman teacup which
is so cute I think it's one of my
favorites don't forget to thumbs up this
video and subscribe if you haven't
already so that's all let's just crack
on for the video so the first DIY
president we're gonna be making is this
cute Maltese a reindeer
so first you want to take some masking
tape and just tape that all the way
around the jar at the top and bottom
next you're going to be reaching at for
some Brown acrylic paint then you're
just going to be covering all of the
inside area
after that you can take a sponge and
load some more paint onto it and just
kind of dab it in a stippling motion all
over the brown area after that you can
take off the masking tape to get a clean
cut edge
now we're going to be reaching a for
some fun googly eyes that I got from the
range and I'm just going to be hot
gluing these onto the jar
at first I wasn't sure which nose I
wanted to go for but in the end I
decided to go for this smaller one and
I'm just using a little pom-pom for that
which you can also get from the range or
any craft store for the antlers I
literally just went outside and grabbed
some branches and I kind of bent them a
little bit towards the end so we can
stick them onto the jar for them to
stick out a little bit now the fun part
we can load up the whole jar with some
Maltesers you can use two or three packs
depending on the size of your jar and
that is it a really fun decoration as
well as a gift for this next one we're
going to be decorating our own cup I'm
going for a snowman design because my
cup is white so I'm just drawing on the
two eyes and a nose with sharpies to
make sure your design stays in place
even when it's washed you have to bake
the mug so you can leave it in the oven
for 30 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit
and remember to place the mug in the
oven before it heats up and leave it in
there until the oven is completely cool
think this DIY is so so cute and it's
very simple and really quick to do its
next DIY is our homemade scrub so you're
going to be needing a jar some olive oil
some granulated sugar food coloring
peppermint extract a bowl and a spoon
firstly I'm adding about seven foods of
sugar into my bowl to that I'm then
adding two teaspoons of olive oil
I'm just mixing that together and then
I'm going in with the peppermint extract
and I'm adding two teaspoons of that
into the mixture
lastly I'm just mixing all of that
together once that's done you can pop
that into the jar and work on the next
bit so for this which is going to be
creating the same exact mixture but the
only difference is we're going to be
adding red food coloring to stain the
sugar red I've added two teaspoons of
this into the mixture so I'm just
popping that in the jar and just
spreading it out this part actually cut
out but I also created a less saturated
red by adding just a little bit less of
the food coloring and I pop that into
the jar as well and it's a really nice
pink color then I'm making another
mixture and I'm turning back to you the
white and then to finish it off I'm
going back with the red mixture and that
is the final gift I think this is such a
gorgeous present for your mum's sister
or friend for this last one you're gonna
need some plain wooden coasters and just
a little bit of artistic skill I'm just
kidding you can totally trace any design
that you want so I'm just going off of
some reference pictures on my laptop and
I decided to draw a reindeer and a tree
for the tree I'm actually just drawing
that from my head but of course if it
helps you can use a reference picture
for the first tool I have been using a
black acrylic paper you can also just
use a sharpie if that's all that you
have laying around and it works just as
well so those are my four DIY Christmas
gifts I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did then definitely give it a
thumbs up and I am planning on making a
DIY home decor for Christmas as well so
