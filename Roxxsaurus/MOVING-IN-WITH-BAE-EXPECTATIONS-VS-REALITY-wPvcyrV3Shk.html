channel I hope you guys are doing super
well today I've got the moving in with
Bay expectation versus reality video I
have been meaning to film this for so
long and I finally got Matt to help me
with the video I really love how this
video turned out so I'm really hoping
that you guys find it enjoyable and
relatable you guys enjoyed this video
make sure you smash that huge thumbs up
let's try and get this video to 30,000
lights I'm sure we can do it and also
subscribe if you are brand new I also
have a vlog channel which I'll link in
the corner that I'm going to be posting
loads more vlogs this year's and make
sure you guys have checked out my blog
channel as well also make sure you
comment down below what you guys relate
to in this video because if you are in a
relationship you will know most of these
struggles so let me know down below
which one you guys relate to but without
further ado let's get into the video so
the first expectation of a relationship
is watching shows together or covered up
watching Netflix and chill in and just
enjoying the same kind of shows because
since you and your boyfriend or
girlfriend have so much in common you
would definitely enjoy the same shows
watch me for Netflix hi darling
alright human blood bank should guess
the sacs yes
but in reality is not like that at all
it goes a little something like this
what's your watch on that looks gossip
go yeah let's watch the Grand Tour
no we watch that the other day oh it's a
serious yeah so is Gossip Girl
I can watch that you know you like it we
always watch what you watch yeah but we
picked what you want to watch guest
today says my turn now what we always
watch with you wanna watch no we always
what were you and I watch it's not true
this is fine watch your girlie show come
on Fran traction
now drive to the beach of the
northernmost points from Olivia where it
meets
so the next expectation is moving in
together so you get to sleep together
every single night it's going to be so
cute and so cozy you two will just spoon
every single night and is going to be
great morning baby oh you breakfast in
bed yeah thank you but in reality I
think we all know that the girls usually
get the most of the bed whilst your
boyfriend or girlfriend are kind of
falling off the edge and they have no
covers and you're just being so greedy
and hogging all of the bedsheets you
actually end up waking at like 1:00
o'clock
rather than like 6:00 a.m. and you have
a lazy day for the rest of the day that
is the reality
so the next expectation is moving in
together and decorating your whole place
so surely because you are so in love you
would think that everything is going to
go super smooth and you guys are going
to agree on every single thing but in
reality now that you're living together
you just start to realize how different
you are and how your taste is so so
different from each other in terms of
home decor what are you doing hang in
the room I thought would be a griddle
gray no I'm better blue I don't like
blue much like a room why can we never
agree on anything to do with a house
every room in this house is gray God has
some color job
rest in peace my beloved Mondays up the
next one is being healthy when you live
in with your partner you usually think
yes this is the time where we're going
to get healthy we're gonna get fit we're
going to do exercise and all this
amazing stuff because you guys have some
spare time out and you don't have to
travel to see each other anymore
you
but in reality you are still just as
unhealthy and if anything you kind of
encourage each other to be and helping
it watch me out for dinner say I don't
know looking here for something or make
our own burgers got pasta yeah we could
have found my pasta now I can't be a
sticker let's just do that
the next expectation of moving in
together is like having your own
his-and-hers shower gel in the bathroom
so the expectation is me using my girly
products where's my boyfriend Matt is
using his like manly shampoos and
conditioners and all that stuff same
reality when you're movin together
everything just becomes first dibs and
in actual reality your boyfriend ends up
using your really expensive shampoo as
shower gel
hey there's no shower gel shampoo would
it
the next one is the dreaded topic the
dishes so the expectation is when you're
moving together everything is going to
be so clean and everyone is going to
have their assigned chores and
everything will be grand but the reality
is that you both are just as messy and
stubborn so you just kind of have to
deal with the dishes in the sink piling
up and resembling something that of an
Eiffel Tower and PS the rubbish is not
going to be taken out for a week at
least
oh there's not even one single clean
Bowl hey can you help me tidy up what
you did this paused can you help me tidy
up
can you help me a lot expectation of
moving in together is being more
outgoing because you are always together
you're gonna like go on all these
amazing adventures and all these road
trips and because you have so much time
together now you can really spend it on
just basically exploring the world hey
everyone so we are going on a road trip
never gonna go back oh seven in a barb
you up to wake up and make up and play
down pretending that I do that well the
reality is far different from that you
both are just bored and stuck at home
all the time because you have no money
you are broke because all you do is
spend your money on takeaway if you've
got a road trip today haven't got any
money
one spend it all on take away every
single day oh yeah I guess we're stuck
in handa
so those are all of the expectations vs.
reality of moving in with Bay honestly
it is hard work it's not easy and
nothing is like it is in the movies
trust me I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and also make sure you
subscribe to my boyfriend Matt he also
