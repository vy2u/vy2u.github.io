is a autumn night routine I haven't done
one of these videos in a long time so I
thought I'd come back out you guys again
and do another one so this is pretty
much my daily evening routine throughout
autumn so the first thing I do when I
walk through the door is of course greet
my cat sky you guys probably already
know her from the vlogs over on my
second channel but she is literally such
a sweetheart so once I say hi to sky I
then head over to at my coat rack and I
basically just take off my coat my bag
my hat and also my shoes and just pop
all of that away once I've done that I
then pop on my really cute slippers from
Primark you guys probably have seen
these in my haul and they're actually
adorable and then head straight into my
living room and turn on the TV as you do
and I'm actually currently re watching
Riverdale from the beginning because I
love the show so much do you guys watch
it as well I always love re watching
shows in the background so whether I'm
working or just generally chilling I
love to always have some kind of sound
in the background so I don't feel like
I'm alone in the house and then head
over to all of my fairy lights on my
kind of like display area and I love to
just turn all of the lights on in my
house because it makes me feel so cozy
and like autumnal
once I've done all that I then also I
like to tidy up a little bit as like the
first thing before I get to relax so I'm
just hoovering up with my Dyson Hoover
which is by the way amazing this Hoover
is literally so lightweight I'm telling
you guys that I actually enjoy hoovering
now which I never used to once I've
tidied up the living room a little bit
I then head over to my laptop and just
to check my emails do some work some
editing also I like to use a Final Cut
Pro to edit with for anyone who's
wondering I find it really easy to use
so as you can see I'm just editing at my
hair tutorial video here now that I've
done my work all I can think about is
just getting into cozy PJ's and just
wiping all of my makeup off I don't
really wear makeup every single day but
when I do and I get home I literally
take it off straight away so the first
thing I'll do is I'll put my hair up
into a ponytail to get it out of my face
and then I will take some simple at
cleansing wipes and just basically wipe
off the first layer of my makeup this is
just the first step to kind of get rid
of all of the foundation and eyeliner
and mascara and that kind of thing but
to really cleanse my skin I've recently
started using the vanity planet ultimate
skin spa face brush I've seen a few
brushes like this on the market but this
one's different because it comes with
three different heads the silicone brush
that resists bacteria buildup the
exfoliating brush which gets rid of dead
skin and also the daily cleansing brush
which I'll be using today so I'm gonna
be using the Nivea exfoliating scrub on
top of the brush which I'm then just
gonna wet with some water and I love the
fact that this comes with a silicone
head too because it really resists
bacteria it makes it really hygienic to
use and being silicone it makes it
really super durable I think it's really
important to look after your skin always
especially in the colder seasons of the
year as my skin can get kind of dry and
oily at the same time so this brush just
really gets rid of the excess oil that
causes clogged pores and it also
prevents future breakouts so it's super
handy to have vanity planet are actually
super generous and they've actually
offered you guys a 70% off of this
product it's originally 125 dollars but
you can now get it for only 39 which is
such a good saving so yeah I'll link it
down below so you guys it can check that
out and pick one up yourself if you want
to so as you can see I have taken so
much dirt and muck off of my face with
this brush and you can then
just rinse it under some hot water and
it's like brand-new
and then you hop in the shower so I'm
just gonna run the shower first to kind
of heat up the water a little bit and
for the shower recently I've been loving
using the vanilla pumpkin shower gel
from the body shop it smells so good
after my shower I then hop into some PJs
I love being cozy so I have these PJs
from Primark which are so adorable
they've got thumper and they're Disney
which I love so then I'm just gonna pop
on some moisturizer on my skin just to
really finish off my skincare routine so
the one I'm using is the Vichy mineral
89 I love this little moisturizer it's
really cool like it has a really cool
consistency and it just refreshes my
skin so much everytime I apply it and
then for my hair I'm gonna be using this
hair oil from Wella and I'm just popping
that over my hands and then I'm just
kind of running my fingers through my
ponytail just to really kind of
moisturize and the dead ends my hair
gets so dry in the autumn I'm telling
you guys I then head back downstairs and
I pop on some candles because no autumn
routine would be complete without some
candles so I have this one from Bath and
Body Works which I love this smells are
so good and then I decided to make
myself some hot chocolate I don't have a
hot chocolate every night I would be so
unhealthy but this evening I thought I
would treat myself the hot chocolate
that I use is the one from galaxy it's
so good lecture you need like three
teaspoons of this and pop some hot water
in you don't even need milk and it
tastes so good and then just gonna take
some whipped cream and top my hot
chocolate off with this I've recently
bought these really cool stencils for
hot chocolates and coffees from eBay so
I'm just using one of the stencils I'm
using one of those today for the first
time so please excuse how this turns out
but I'm just popping some hot cocoa
powder over the stencil and once you a
take off the stencil it should leave you
with a really cool design on your hot
chocolate which definitely makes you
look like a pro from Starbucks
and obviously my hot chocolate couldn't
have gone to waste so I had to take some
selfies just to show off my masterpiece
then for the next few hours I basically
just watch TV I'm on my laptop I'm
actually moving house so I'm doing
somewhat furniture shopping for my
office I decided to buy a desk from its
website called my calm I actually love
the stuff on there and it's actually
quite affordable so I decided to order a
desk for when I move after a few hours
of online shopping I basically go into
the kitchen and make myself a really
super healthy and easy dinner I just
decided to go for some noodles and some
veg and I've been using these blue
dragon sauces for such a long time
they're literally so good and then I
just eat my dinner in front of the TV
watching
stranger things at season 2 do you guys
like hair I kind of prefer season one
but I haven't really watched that much
of it to kind of judge it yeah but let
me know what you guys are watching on
Netflix at the moment I then head
upstairs and just brush my teeth before
I get into bed and I would love to let
you know that I literally go straight
into bed but I really don't I'm like
everyone else I go on my phone before I
go to bed which is so bad I always use
my time in bed before I fall asleep to
kind of check social media reply to you
guys and basically I've been loving
Instagram lately if you guys don't
follow me on Instagram yet it's just at
rock surahs I love replying to your
comments and liking and favoriting your
stuff
so make sure you head over there and
follow me as well but that is the end of
my night routine I hope you guys enjoyed
it and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
