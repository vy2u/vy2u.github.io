so today I am joined by a special guest
it's marina moustache
so this is my well little brother
technically he's actually my little
brother and that's my boyfriend but
you're pretty much like my brother are
you before you go today what are you
gonna be doing my makeup right yeah do
you know anything about makeup no no
okay well this is gonna be a great test
for both of us yeah my face is probably
gonna get ruined so this is pretty much
like a Halloween look but no Bernie just
my prediction what you're gonna start
with do you have any clue do you need a
clue from me or even bro okay so he's
got like a bunch of brushes down here a
bunch of makeup you can choose from
anything so you've just heard in that
time you gonna do that so what do you
reckon that is a bunch of different
names stuff yeah what is it for though
would you recommend shaving again it's
an eyeshadow palette and you're gonna
use that tiny little brush no yeah
hopefully not I should show them if you
want to be a real warrior you gotta show
them what you're using is going up with
some fat spell I'm writing myself okay
go on
do whatever you feel like is is the
right thing to do is anything happening
no maybe take a darker shadow okay okay
go for like a rosy gold eyeshadow yes
you know what I'm gonna not look at
myself for the whole time and then at
the end of look at it and I'm gonna tell
you what what I think surprisingly
you're surprising me you're actually
quite gentle like when Matt did my
makeup he was really like like pushing
the brush into my eye poking out this is
the black black eyes black eyed peas I'm
ready for my Halloween makeover by the
way this is some make me pretty and make
it like a good look for me to go out
when we go to the park yeah cuz I'm
gonna wear this one out now he's changed
and this has to be presentable for the
outside like world okay oh he's retiring
why are you going on the side of my what
would you call this must face before you
do it black bronze gold okay
this is the black from Scott look guys
that's that's the look okay I've just
given him a different palette and this
is like the burgundy palette from
Maybelline and it's got all kinds of
colors and they're actually shimmery
they're a little bit more exciting then
this one here so you know just knock
yourself out with whatever colors no I
love a brick brick
I just don't understand where you put
that on my cheek what about my actual I
will be on my eyelids yeah there we go
now again somewhere I think I should
actually wear this look to the park when
we go do you dare me do you do you guys
there me because I think I can get quite
funny I'm just looking at myself in the
viewfinder I don't really look like a
panda and I'm using my eyes black all
over that's what I'm gonna start saying
we need to know this for me I'm making
like oh you need to make my skin I'm
gonna make Roxy looks like Jackson from
my belt for Christmas if you haven't
seen already so don't want this
[Laughter]
remember this look it's not to wear out
like this I'm using the fit me from
Maybelline mm-hmm and it makes your skin
girl really Pam yeah so he's put it
straight on the brush on my face in the
mirror I'm gonna feel more beautiful
[Laughter]
like holding your breath as I do my chin
looks very pale right now have you ever
seen our Anthony you have yet to learn
about makeup what would I use to like
around here so what's for the cheeks I'm
using the make you blush
yeah and that's going we're from soap &amp;amp;
Glory and where are you gonna put that
run cheaper ground the cheekbones that
same brush that he got all the other one
[Laughter]
we're gonna be the only thing that it's
actually looking decent or my face no
not even that okay what what's next
I'm rushed so now for the contour powder
so there's a little diagram where you
can put on your face he's learning from
the diagram right now okay for the
middle shade uh-huh but you know
actually where you put it not bad maybe
we can salvage this look ah what's like
the technique here what are you doing
with the brush all right like dumping it
dumping it thanks I grew up with you're
gonna go for the lip yeah yeah relevant
kicks velvet kids from collection it's
just a look so guys we are actually a
little bit further down the look but
sadly the camera cut out so we had to
like yeah basically pick up where we
left off so this is what Anthony has
done already he said like lipstick and
eyeliner think since he's done like
eyeliner mascara and lipstick right
since it cut out so let's continue what
are you gonna use now I'm using the perk
ensue
mmm-hmm why are they go la girl
cold and kind of breath from where
you've done you've done the freakin
eyeliner on my eyelid and my eyelids are
sticking together you can leave it like
this just for fun I'm the nay that's
just not right
you give me whiskers no just going to
town this is my everyday look guys I get
you like you know it's time like this
tomorrow my name funny look I think so
would you say this is done yeah yeah
what would you rate this out of town

gonna have a look up close now see your
masterpiece oh my god that looks like a
flying bird across my forehead
you have your blankets I can see oh my
god my eyes oh my god you are and that's
sick isn't too bad the blushes are too
bad your head isn't too bad apart from
this to whatever that is but everything
else is pretty awful nice oh my god
why's that
that's like a gone wrong eyeline 11
drooping down with a swing you would I
give it a 3 out of 10 right 3 out of 10
yeah it looks better without the
concealer on yeah and cuz when you stood
