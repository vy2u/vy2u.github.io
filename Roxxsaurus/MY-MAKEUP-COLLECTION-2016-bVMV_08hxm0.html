channel today I'm going to be filming my
makeup collection for you guys I'm super
excited to be filming this video because
it is quite a requested video from you
guys just a quick disclaimer before we
jump straight in I'm not trying to brag
by posting this video I'm just placing
this video because you guys requested
quite a lot and I just thought it would
be a lot of fun I definitely don't feel
like I have that much makeup I mean
there are other youtubers who have so
much makeup than I do I just kind of
like to keep it on the smaller side so I
get to use a lot of the products that I
have without them going to waste if you
know what I mean but with that being
said I do love my makeup I do have a
beauty channel so I do get sent a lot of
makeup from different brands but I
haven't bought most of the stuff with my
own money and also if you guys would
like to see my room tour which is
another video that a lot of you guys
request and definitely head over to my
vlog channel I recently posted my first
vlog ever to check that out and also
subscribe because the ones I hear 20,000
subscribers on that channel I'm going to
be filming a room tour on my main
channel okay so enough with the wrapper
leg let's just jump right into the video
okay so starting off with my vanity desk
I get questions about it all the time
and I actually got this from a store
called Danelle in the UK I don't know if
they have the shop in any other
countries but I really love this shop so
much because they have all kinds of
French star furniture like this vanity -
the only downside with this vanity era
is that it doesn't have much storage as
you can see it's only got one drawer
which means I'm very limited with how I
store my makeup and this means I also
have to have another chest of drawers on
the side there which I keep the rest of
my makeup in and then moving on to the
chair this chair is actually custom made
by my dad it was basically an all chair
from a vintage saw that we revamped to
fit the style of my room okay so moving
a little bit close this is what the top
of my desk looks like I actually
recently redecorated all of this in my
previous makeup collection I didn't have
my foundations out on display like this
so that's a new feature that I did and I
also changed around all the makeup at
the top here ok so the first thing is
this little I don't really know what to
call this like a trinket chest thing if
that's you from the range and again this
goes really well of the desk because
got that same Victorian inspired ranch
start feel to it so at the top here I
kind of have my most aesthetically
pleasing makeup which is actually mostly
from Too Faced this is a brand that I
haven't been using for that long but I'm
actually obsessed with all the packaging
so yeah most of the makeup on here is
from a two-faced because the packaging
is just so adorable as you can see they
have like heart-shaped packaging it's
all pink and gold which is super super
cute and these are what is this this is
the blush in shade love hangover it's
just so so cute I absolutely love their
packaging then I have some chocolate
Soleil bronzers and also a highlight
here and these actually smell like
chocolate which is absolutely amazing
then I have the two Too Faced chocolate
palettes this is the chocolate bonbon
palette looks like this it's so so
adorable it's all pink which is so up my
street planning on doing a makeup
tutorial with this palette very soon and
then I of course have the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette and
again this palette is so amazing it
smell like chocolate I literally just
want to eat it then on the side I've got
my benefit what's up highlighter I have
the benefit balázs this is such
adorable packaging as well behind the
blush I have my sleek solstice
highlighter palette and a girl and blush
down there then at the back here I've
got my Urban Decay Gwen Stefani blush
palette and a two-faced melted chocolate
liquid lipstick as well as the benefit
Porefessional primer and then in the
drawer below I have some miscellaneous
products mostly blushes and then a few
brow powders and then there's the odd
concealer and a Maybelline gel Winans
so down here I've got my Urban Decay
Gwen Stefani brow powder as well as the
Loreal brow artist underneath there then
I have two of my sleep blushes my NARS
orgasm and a rosy 4 autograph blush
underneath I also keep the rosy for
autograph shimmering powder this is
actually a really good shimmering powder
you guys and then I have my two L'Oreal
blushes as well as my Bobbi Brown blush
underneath there and then I have a deep
art of Mac faux in here and the bun
concealer by benefit so that's all for
that draw I also have these two sides
drawers here if you can see but I don't
really keep much in there because
they're quite small drawers so I just
keep like sharpeners and stuff like that
which you guys don't really need to see
so moving on to the side here
got my makeup brushes I actually used to
have much more than this but I got rid
of them recently because I just feel
like I don't actually need that many
these are all the brushes that I use on
a daily basis and it just saves me so
much time cleaning all the brushes that
I have and really when I have loads of
brushes all they do is just collect dust
so that's not fun to clean so I just
keep all my most used brushes here and I
am aware they do need a little bit of a
wash but yeah and then on the right hand
side of that I've got my long kind of
like lip liners eyeliners and just
all-around long products so I have my
Mac spice lip liner I have the esti
daughter little black liner which is a
really good liner I've got the archery
brow putty by soap &amp;amp; Glory my Urban
Decay brow beat her a few urban decay
lip liners so what else do I have in
here I have a NYX jumbo lip pencil and
then down here I also keep my benefit
powder flash powder because I don't
really have a place to put it anywhere
else and then we've been down to the
bottom here I just keep my most used
products like my Urban Decay prep spray
and my setting spray our Urban Decay I
also have the Body Shop vitamin E face
mist and all of my Liz Elle product like
my daily moisturizer and then down here
I've got this little container I think
this is actually from home base and I
keep my cotton buds in there for
removing my makeup okay so moving on to
my foundations this is where I keep them
kind of displayed because I have quite a
lot of these and I don't really have any
other place to put them I quite like how
they look displayed on this little plate
from the range so some of the
foundations I have are the Maybelline
fit me foundation I have the Giorgio
Armani fluid shear which is like a
highlighter I have my East Saint Laurent
foundation this is actually officiates
darker but I use this to mix in with my
foundation if I have a tan I've got my
Bobbi Brown foundation in stick form I
have the L'Oreal infallible 24 hour
matte foundation I have a few L'Oreal
foundations actually because I think
that they're really affordable and I
really like them and also have the
infallible 24 hour foundation as well
then I have my fresh nude foundation by
the body shop along with the shade
adjusting drops I have the George Armani
maestro foundation as well it's got a
little pipette these are quite pricy but
they are really were for the hype and I
also
the luminous silk foundation by Giorgio
Armani as well and I've also been sent
the Born This Way Foundation by Too
Faced which I'm super excited to try out
I'm kind of late on the bandwagon of
this foundation but I've heard amazing
things about it and then at the bottom
here I've just got my Bobbi Brown
concealer my L'Oreal Paris studio
secrets primer and my Jojo Armani by a
stray UV primer okay so on the left-hand
side I have this plastic container for
my lipsticks and I got this from TK Maxx
on the front as you can see I've got all
of my MAC lipsticks and one lipstick by
the balm I just popped it here because
it's the same shape as the other ones if
you guys would like to see my MAC
lipstick collection I'll pop the link
down in the description and then I have
some of my Urban Decay lipsticks down
here I've got a few L'Oreal lipsticks
and I've got one Chanel lipstick this is
in shade aura and this is a really
gorgeous purple shade I then also have a
lipstick by gosh this is in shade
sweetheart I have a little Lancome lip
gloss I think this is a lip gloss anyway
and this is in shade berry in love and
this smells are like berries which is
amazing then I have a few of the sleek
lipsticks this is my favorite it's in
shade private base I have this urban
decay lipstick in shade native this is
such a gorgeous color it's like a really
light pink nudie shade then I have this
gorgeous lipstick by Illamasqua and this
is in shade growl it's like a really
dark vampy lip color for the autumn oh

these little containers for my brushes I
do have a DIY on how to create these
makeup and brush holders so I'll leave a
