channel I hope you guys are all well
today as you can tell from the title I'm
going to be doing a summer night routine
because I absolutely love making routine
videos and I don't do them on earth and
I have already done a morning routine
and a night routine in the life of my
youtube channel so I'll leave those down
below if you guys want to check them out
if you guys are doing this video be sure
to give a big ol thumbs up and also
don't forget to subscribe to this
channel as well as my vlog channel if
you have never seen this face before so
there's one from me I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and let's just jump
straight into it so the first thing I do
when I get home is of course get greeted
by my dog Buster he's such a sweetheart
he always waits by the door for us until
we get home to be honest every time I
get home I just want to get into comfy
clothes you know just get like really
cozy so I reach for my PJs and I just go
straight for a shower
to cleanse my face and get rid of any
makeup on it I am reaching for my
cleanse and polish bile is all and this
is when my favorite cleanses slash face
washes it just makes your skin feel so
refreshed and it literally gets rid of
the most stubborn makeup so now that
I've just hopped out of the shower I'm
reaching for my braun silk-épil 5
epilator feel like epilating your legs
is the easiest way to get rid of hair
and especially if you want long-lasting
results it gets rid of your hair for up
to four weeks and I feel like around
summer time everyone wants this really
smooth legs and this you don't get those
horrible razor bubbles that you would
with a razor which is why I love using
this instead of shaving my legs I think
that this was great for those new to
epilating because it's bronze most
gentle epilator capturing the hairs that
are even as small as a grain of sand and
you can use this wet for dry which is
amazing
I actually prefer to use it dry but you
can use it in the shower it's actually
waterproof and those of you who are
wondering you can actually purchase this
in store and online that superdrug it is
still very important to moisturize the
skin around summertime because I feel
like your skin can get a little bit
burnt at time and the sun rays are
damaging to the skin and can make it
more drying crack so I'm using this Liz
are a botanical lotion I'm just applying
this to my arms and my legs and this is
also going to prep my legs for some fake
tan that I'm about to pop onto my leg so
between epilating or shaving your legs
make sure you wait a significant amount
of time before you actually apply any
fake tan as it can clog your pores up so
you have to be a little bit careful as
some of you may know England has not got
the best weather around summertime so we
hardly ever get any Sun which is why my
legs are as pasty as a ghost half the
time so that is why I'm applying some
fake tan on just to kind of give them
that sunkissed effect and make them more
balance with the rest of my body after
that I usually head over to my vanity
area and apply my kind of nighttime
regime for my skin
I only use about two or three products
and I like to switch it up so today I'm
using the Lancome hydro-zone moisturizer
and my under item is in the Clinique all
about eyes eye creams I always like to
brush out my hair before I go to bed so
for this I'm using my bronze satin hair
7 oil tech brush this is the ultimate
summer beauty must-have to tame flyaways
as it uses this ion Tec technology that
basically reduces the positive static in
your hair and this is what causes that
frizz and flyaways in your hair which is
so so annoying and this brush can also
be purchased at superdrug once my hair
is brushed I am now ready for my dinner
and today I'm having some corn chicken
and veg with some grilled potatoes it
was so so good after dinner I usually
just chill in my bed for the rest of the
evening the evening is my favorite time
of the day as this is the time where I
get to do things for myself I get to
relax I get to listen to music that I
like watch shows and talk to you guys as
you can see my captain e has joined me
he is literally my best friend we watch
TV shows together we sleep together he
is just a babe I love him so much look
how adorable he is and by the way do you
have a pet that is only affectionate
with you but no one else in your family
because this is what happens with me and
Timmy he's only affectionate with me
it's so strange
so the evening is definitely the time
where I get to reply to you guys and
just connect with you on a more personal
level via social media so at this point
I usually check my vlog channel reply to
comments on my main channel check my
Instagram snapchat Twitter follow me by
the way
shameless promo but honestly over on my
social media I talked to you guys the
most especially Twitter I also make my
snapchat public sometimes so make sure
you find me over there as well so right
before I'm off to bed I just watch a bit
of Pretty Little Liars
I have probably watched this show like
three times over and over again it's
literally my favorite it never fails to
shock me I have to say after I've coop
all my favorite shows I just blurt the
candles and go to sleep by the way note
that at this point is probably like 3
a.m. is that just me anyone else that is
all for this video I really hope you
guys enjoyed and if you did be sure to
give a thumbs up so I know I want you
guys to comment down below what shows
you guys watch and what you recommend
for me to watch over the summer because
I'm really searching for a good new show
to watch and I just want it to blow you
away
so no pressure but pick wisely or you
suggested because it is not this show I
won't judge you
I'm kidding away judging but let me know
what I should want channel for me I'm
gonna stop rambling now and I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and I've
seen very seen in my next video
I'm doing 10 things only girls can
understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
