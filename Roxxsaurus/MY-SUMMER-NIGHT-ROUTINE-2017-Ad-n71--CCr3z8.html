doing a summer night routine and I'm
very excited to this video because I
haven't done a night routine or any kind
of routine for that matter in ages
Alysha per like so long so this video is
basically a very chill kind of like
follow me around video to show you guys
what I get up to in my summer night I am
also very proud to say that this video
is sponsored by PNG and I'm going to be
showing you guys a two really awesome
products from Braun and Venus later on
in the video that will literally save
your life at this summer you guys are
doing these kinds of videos and would
like me to do more routines in the
future give this video a huge thumbs up
and also subscribe down below I would
love to have you here come and join it
the dinosaur family but without some
review and let's get on into the video
so I start off my night routine by
getting home after a long day at London
either in meetings or attending events
as I approach the front door I usually
get greeted by my neighbor's cat Charlie
he's such a little cutie I absolutely
adore him after I said hello to Charlie
I go inside the house and pop my bag on
the hanging rail and take my shoes off
first thing I do when I get in is go
into my lounge and put the TV on as I
absolutely hate feeling like I'm home
alone I always have to have some kind of
background noise is that just me I then
just pop myself on my couch and the
first thing I do is go on my laptop and
check my emails and reply to comment on
my latest videos after I've done my work
I pretty much had upstairs into the
bathroom and grab a bath and also get
into comfy clothes there's literally
nothing better than getting into nice
and comfy clothes after a long day of
sweating or through this heat I run
myself a bath and whilst that's
happening I usually take my makeup off
with a face light I actually decided to
treat myself to a little rainbow fizzy
bath foam today because why not after
sitting in the bath for a little while
it gives my skin a chance to open up its
paws and also soften any body hair which
brings me on to using my trusty broad
Ethel silk 5 epilator you guys may have
seen this bad boy in my last summer
night routine and I'm still loving it so
much I wanted to tell you about the new
version as it now comes with a new
beginner cap which is perfect for those
new to epilating I said no internet
blades shape as your epilating meaning
that only 60% of hairs are actually
plucked from the root which really eases
the initial pain of epilating and allows
you to like gently get used to the
sensation it also has a wet and dry
function and you can use it in or out of
the bathtub as you can see and it's just
so quick and easy to use after you only
silk April 5 with a new beginner cap for
full weeks your hair should have been
plucked from the root at least once and
your skin will be used to the sensation
of epilating
finding it virtually pain-free then you
can progress on to the normal epilating
cap which plugs a hundred percent of
your hair from the roots leaving a
really smooth result which lasts up to
four weeks which is perfect for the
summer holidays if you're going away the
summer looking for some
more portable then the Venus snap Cosmo
is perfect for those quick and easy on
the go touch ups which is this really
cute mini portable razor and this is
definitely going on holiday with me this
month once I'm out of the bath I like to
use a facial scrub to scrub away any
dead skin cells on my face so what I'm
using today is this coffee one and this
is from organic botanic Australia and it
smells so good after that I also like to
moisturize and my whole body as the Sun
can dry out a little bit so I'm using
this chili mango and tonka bean a body
lotion from being by sanctuary and you
guys this literally it smells like
heaven next I'm going to change into
something a little more comfortable like
I said so I'm popping on some shorts and
also a comfy t-shirt and then I'm going
to head downstairs so it's now time for
dinner and tonight I decided to make
myself a vegan pizza with a bunch of
vegetables like peppers courgette onion
and sweet corn so I'm just chopping all
of that up and putting that into a pan
to cook it all once they're cooked I put
them straight onto the pizza and off it
goes into the oven this pizza is one of
my go-to for dinner as it's really quick
to make and it's also still quite
healthy and I then watch TV for the next
three hours because let's be honest
that's what we do in all of our night
routine once this starts getting dark I
like to pop my curtain shut and have a
little cuddle with my cats coho and then
I have a little bit of a mini spa now I
don't do this every night of course but
it's nice to treat yourself sometimes so
I'm applying these cucumber iPad's onto
my eyes for a few minutes and also using
these really cute moisturizing socks for
my feet from hala and Glo after my mini
spa I occasionally like to go outside
into the garden and just have a little
bonfire to relax and unwind
so after tuning in the garden for a
little bit I come back inside and play
my guitar to trying to self teach myself
some new songs if you guys watch my
daily vlogs you already know that I
haven't played Utah for a few years and
I've only just started recently playing
again which is really fun when I start
getting a little bit tired I had
obsessed to do my skincare routine which
is actually really simple so first I
like to brush my hair my tangle teezer
and also spray some coconut water just
to hydrate my hair a little bit I also
like to braid my head before I go to
sleep I pretty much do this every night
because I like to keep it out of the way
and stop it from breaking while I toss
and turn in bed next I like to apply
some kind of deeply hydrating serum to
my face and I decided to use this lumen
Urban intense serum all over my face and
to finish off my skincare routine I
usually apply this is super skin eye
cream from Liz Elle just underneath my
eyes once I'm finished with that I head
into the bathroom to brush my teeth
using my electric toothbrush and after
that I head straight into the bedroom
when I get in bed I like to go on my
social media to check up with you guys
and you know just have a little scroll
for Instagram see what everyone's been
up to today and then I head on to
Twitter to say goodnight to you guys and
lastly I put my phone away on my bedside
table and I go to sleep
so that was my night routine I really
have you guys enjoyed it I have so much
fun filming this video and show you guys
when I get up to every night pretty much
but that is all from me for today I
really enjoyed this video and up see you
guys very soon in my next one bye guys
