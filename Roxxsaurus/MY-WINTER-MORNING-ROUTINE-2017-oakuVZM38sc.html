alarm going off and me freezing the heck
out too during wintertime I sometimes
wake up thinking it's Christmas and I
get really disappointed when I realize
it's not
when I finally roll out of bed I'll pop
on my really cute bunny slippers and
I'll very messily try to make my bed you
guys I don't know what it is but making
my bed is just not my forte I will then
head over to the bathroom and do my
usual morning business wait that sounds
kind of weird I don't mean number two
I'm talking about my skincare routine so
I'll wash my face with the Elissa
cleanse and polish and I've really been
liking using this lately it's so gentle
on my skin so I just popped that all
over my face and just rub it on and then
I wash it off with lukewarm water I'm
then gonna apply some serum to my face
I'm using the lumen serum and this is so
nice to keep my skin really hydrated
especially at winter time I've really
just been enjoying using this and then
lastly I'll of course brush my teeth
because you don't want that morning
breath once I do that I'll then head
straight downstairs into the kitchen
that's where the magic happens
just kidding I'm a rubbish cook but I do
try I first like to pull this off a
glass of water and just drink the whole
thing pretty much I feel like this
really helps with clearing my skin and
really wakes me up for the day
before I make my breakfast I will then
just pop on some music on my speaker I'm
currently loving wolves by Selena and
marshmallow and then I'll just make
myself some breakfast for breakfast
today I'm just having some fruit and
pastries because like I said I'm a
rubbish cook but let's not talk about
that I don't know if this is just me but
whenever it's the morning I'm never
usually that hungry but as soon as
lunchtime hits
I am literally starving so my breakfasts
are a lot of the time pretty light once
I have my breakfast on hand I'll go into
the living room and just pop my
breakfast on the side and then I'll go
and light some candles on my fireplace
to really get me feeling super cozy and
make the whole house smell amazing I'll
then eat my breakfast like a hermit
wrapped in a blanket in front of the TV
I'm currently watching Riverdale like I
said in my night routine and I'm still
just really enjoying that show let me
know what show you guys are enjoying on
Netflix cuz I'm always on the lookout
for some new shows so after I finished
my breakfast I went to get the mail from
the door and I actually got the sims 4
desk for my PlayStation in the post
today which I'm so excited about I have
basically been playing Sims on my laptop
for years when I was younger so the fact
that they have brought it out on console
is so cool and I'm very excited to be
partnering up with the game for this
video I've always loved how in Sims you
have like the power to control and
create people in a virtual world where
there's like no rules or laws the
concepts with the game has really just
been so intriguing to me so in the new
Sims you can create really unique Sims
characters with very distinct
appearances and even some new emotions
which is really cool I've actually
decided to create myself in the game
it's just so much fun to try and create
yourself because there's so many choices
of outfits and features and things like
that it's so cool that the game actually
allows you to design your own layout of
your house choose your furniture and
even alter like the landscape that you
live in and also I really like that the
choices you make in the game have very
similar consequences as real life so
every choice in the game really shapes
your sim from birth all into adulthood
I could literally just choose a
furniture for my house like all day and
just like rearrange the house and build
new houses like all day on set
I'm just so addicted to it and I always
have been I used to spend way too much
time playing this game on my laptop
after a little while of playing Sims
I'll just have a little cuddle with Skye
she is such a little naughty girl have
you guys seen my vlog recently she
basically ruined our carpet you guys
need to see it so after I've done that
I'll then just head upstairs back into
my bedroom and choose an outfit for the
day because we obviously have to get
dressed at some point to function like a
normal human being so I just went for a
very casual kind of outfit today just a
plain jumper and some leggings I'll then
go into my filming slash a beauty room
and I'll just get ready for the day my
kind of everyday makeup routine is so
simple in it she takes like five minutes
to do i'll only pop a little bit of
foundation i've been loving the
charlotte tilbury foundation at the
moment so I'm just using that all over
my face and just blending it in I'll
then go in with some Tarte bronzer and
I'll just basically apply a little bit
of that on my cheekbones and also my
temples just to add a bit of more
definition and color back into my face I
then pop on some NYX and blusher onto my
cheekbones and then I'll also add some
Becca highlighter onto my cheekbones and
my nose and that is pretty much my skin
kind of makeup finished and then I'm
just going with some lash curlers that I
got from Primark and just curl my lashes
and I'll apply it some Stila mascara to
my top lashes and that is literally my
makeup finished for the day it's so
simple and I just love doing this kind
of natural no makeup and makeup kind of
look I'll then just get my scarf and put
my coat on and all that good stuff
because obviously it's cold in the
winter and I'll basically just head out
for the day and that is my morning
routine that finished thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
