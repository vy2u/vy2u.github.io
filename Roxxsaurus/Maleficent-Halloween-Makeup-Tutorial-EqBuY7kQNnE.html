a Maleficent makeup a look and I hope
you guys enjoyed this I actually made
these horns by myself I will link as a
tormal that I used to make these down
below if you guys are interested to see
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and make sure you stay till the end
because I have a really cool
announcement that's very exciting so I
hope you guys stay till the end and stay
tuned for that so first things first I'm
reaching for my Chanel Lumiere
foundation and I'm applying that all
over the face with a real techniques a
foundation brush just to get that
flawless complexion that Maleficent has
I'm now using my serving glory one heck
of a blot powder just to set that
foundation in place and for this I'm
using my Real Techniques contour brush
moving on to the eyebrows I'm reaching
from my naked 2 palette by urban decay
and using my Real Techniques angled
precision brush I'm gonna be filling in
my brows with black I'm gonna be
outlining the natural shape of my
eyebrows but just slightly arching them
a little bit more than they usually are
next I'm gonna be using my Urban Decay
primer potion just to prime the eyelids
so that they're all ready for the
eyeshadow for the crease color of this
look I'm going to be reaching for a
single eyeshadow by Versace and this is
the stunning voluminous eyeshadow this
is the perfect combination of purple and
blue toned eyeshadow so I thought I
would use this one and pop that in the
crease as a transition color that we can
blend all of the darker shades into
background fell in three two one
I look so shocked next I'm using my
sleek or natural 601 eyeshadow palette
and I'm going for the plum shadow of
this palette just to build up a little
bit of that shadow in the crease and
depth in it a little bit I'm now moving
onto a smaller pencil shaped fluffy
brush and I'm pulling that same shadow
from the sleek palette onto my lower
lash line to tie the whole look together
with that same brush I'm also going over
the crease line and I'm just really
defining that making sure we get a sharp
line I'm sort of creating like a cut
crease shape with this shadow because
Maleficent is a cartoon slash fictional
character villain her eyes look much
more defined than a human's I would so
what we're going to be doing is just
creating now evil-looking countries
I'm then also pulling that shadow into
the inner part of my eye as you can see
it's sort of quite close to my nose
bridge and I'm creating a shadow there
as well
and this will just ensure that the tear
ducts pop out a lot and look much more
cartoon like I'm then returning back to
that purple shadow from the sleek
palette and all I'm doing is I'm just
blending out that outer corner because
it seems quite sharp and I'm just
blending it towards the center of my
eyelid now loading a white shadow from
the sleek palette onto a flat brush I'm
just patting that into the inner corner
and sort of dragging it into the center
of my eyelids as well I'm now going back
to the black shadow from the sink
palette and using a thin flat brush I'm
just going over the crease once again
and sharpening it even more
using that flat brush I'm also going to
be extending the crease line and going
into my inner corner a little bit as you
can see and this is just gonna create
that really villain like look and it's
gonna make your eyes look much more
animalistic and evil I'm then also going
to be creating that same line but in my
actual inner corner and I'm just drawing
a line parallel to that one that we just
drew before and then I'm going into the
rest of my waterline and tightline and
I'm just placing that shadow down I'm
then using my Rimmel exaggerate
waterproof eyeliner just to go over any
parts that I might have missed I'm now
reaching for my Schwing liquid liner by
the balm and I'm creating a cat wing
with this I just remembered that I
forgot to highlight my brow bone so I'm
just going back and I'm just
highlighting my brow bone just
underneath the brows you really define
them I'm now applying a few coats of the
mascara
already for the lashes later on moving
right along on to the face I'm gonna be
easing the sleek palettes to contour as
well so I'm just mixing any Brown shadow
and the cool toned gray shadow and I'm
using my Real Techniques contour brush
to contour my cheeks I'm going off of
the reference picture by Angelina
Jolie's makeup and her cheekbones are
really really defined and sharp so I'm
just trying to recreate that same look
to highlight how prominent that
cheekbones are I'm also going to be
using some white eyeshadow and just
placing that shadow right next to the
contour just to make the cheekbones pop
out even more I'm now using the same
combination of shadows and a small
fluffy brush to contour my nose to make
it appear more slender like Angelina
Jolie's for the lips I'm using media by
Mac
and for the top I'm also gonna be using
a Mac Ruby whoo
just to create a little gradient effect
ellipse so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and now for the big announcement
of my secret project some of you guys
might already know what this is because
I did post about it on Instagram but
basically what it is is I've launched my
own t-shirts how cool so this design
that you see here is actually designed
and illustrated all by yours truly I am
so excited for us to check these out the
platform t-shirts
I'm also launching tote bags select
shopping bags with this same design at
the moment I've only got this one design
but who knows maybe in the future
there'll be some more Teesha that I have
is in size small and this is the unisex
t-shirt there's also a woman's t-shirt
but I preferred the cut of the unisex so
just because the neckline is a little
bit closer to your neck rather than
low-cut and these sleeves are also quite
long so they go up to like here which
are quite liked as well and this is like
the first ever project that I've ever
launched on YouTube so this is a pretty
big deal to me and I don't know I would
just love for you guys to check these
out because I would literally hug one of
you guys if I saw you wearing this
t-shirt in public I think it would just
be so cool for those of you wondering
when we do ship worldwide so wherever
you may live we will post to you but it
also depends where you live on how long
at the process of the posting will be so
if you live in the UK the shipping will
be very quick you'll probably get this
t-shirt or tote bag within literally one
day but anywhere else it could take from
three to seven days in the Europe and
outside of that it could take probably
up to two weeks or so but yeah it just
depends on where you live I'm so excited
for you guys to check these out so yeah
I will have the store down below if you
want to check them out it'll be the
first leg so if you guys would like to
get one of these t-shirts then check
that out I won't keep you guys in the
anger I hope you guys
a wonderful day and I'll see you very
soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
