dry circles and one gonna use for this
is the collection 2000 illuminating
touch light diffusing concealer and I'm
just going to pop that underneath my
dark circles to just brighten them up a
little bit
next I'm just going to tie to that for
my stay matte powder to just set it all
in place to fill in my brows today I'm
going to be seeing these number seven
amazing eyes pencil in tan Brown and I
am just going to follow the shape of
Marilyn Monroe's eyebrows and trying to
further in a similar as possible because
my eyebrows a little bit too dark for
this wig and very long rows above what
has dark I'm going to be going in with a
eyebrow powder and I'm going to be using
these collection eyebrow kit and I'm
gonna take in the lightest shade and it
is her eyebrow brush like this I'm going
to sort of crumble the brush side into
the lightest shade and I'm then going to
brush that through my eyebrows
next we can wriggle to contouring and to
contour I'm going to be using a
foundation powder that is a little bit
darker than my natural skin tone and the
one I'm going to be using is the double
perfection Lumiere long-wear flawless
sunscreen powder makeup this is in 80
beige and this is a really really good
powder foundation and I like to use this
in a to contour with because it's just
like I said a few shades darker and it's
matte so that's perfect
so I'm gonna take a little brush like
this and swirl it around in there a
little bit and then pop that in the
hollows of my cheek bones
now we can move on to the eyes and for
the eyes I'm going to be using really
sleek makeup palette and this is in ona
trial 601 from this we're going to be
using that the white shade which is this
one here so I'm just going to use that
as a base color for the whole of the lid
I'm also going to pop that on my brow
bone to highlight it
now I'm going to be moving on to the
naked 2 palette and from this palette
I'm going to be using T's and this is
going to be my sort of like transition
color and it's also going to define the
crease so I'm using the fluffy end of my
naked 2 palette brush and I'm very very
lightly popping that into the crease I'm
taking it a little bit higher than I
usually would because maryland's in lid
space was very large then this will just
sort of recreate that
I'm going to blend it out really well
Marilyn's eyeliner was always very
elongated but nothing too crazy I want
to try and recreate that using a felt
tip liner the one I'm going to be using
is scandalous eyes by Rimmel it looks
like this it's one of my favorite
eyeliners ever Marilyn's makeup artist
would sometimes do this trick where he
would take a matte Brown shadow so I'm
just going to go in with the eyebrow
palette that I used and I'm gonna take
that on a thin brush and I'm very to
extend the lower lash line this will
sort of create a illusion of the shadow
of my lashes makes yours look much more
heavier and makes your eyes look pretty
sleepy which is a look that Marilyn
would often spot to slightly open up my
eyes and make them look a little bit
more awake I'm gonna be singing a what
eyeliner and the one I'm going to be
using is unclouded by Sigma it looks
like this and I'm just going to be
popping that on my waterline and
dragging that into the inner corner
next time of course the eyelashes and
I'm going to be using the mega plush by
Maybelline and this is a gorgeousness
scar makes your lashes really really
long and really volumize so that's why I
love it of course no Marilyn Monroe
makeup look for would be finished
without some false lashes so I'm just
going to put some Demi lashes on and
I'll be right back
so my eyelashes are now on and we can
now move on to the cheeks I'm gonna be
using a Bobby Brown blush today to just
give my face a little bit of color
Marilyn would always use some sort of
pink blush once that's done you can move
on to the lips I'm going to be going for
a typical red Marilyn Monroe lip as a
matter of fact she didn't actually
always have a red lips sometimes she
would wear pink lipstick but on film it
just look for bread and to line my lips
I'm going to be using a very um lip
liner in red I'm just going to try and
follow my lip shape but trying to make
it look similar to hers
if that makes any sense
when lipstick choice for this makeup
look is a lipstick by a store and this
is in shade red couture in 2:05 next I'm
going to be going in with another
lipstick this one is by collection mm
it's in shades cherry pop eight and it's
a lighter shade of red to just highlight
my inner part of the lip and make it
look more plump and full next I'm going
to be using a clear lip gloss and this
one is by Revlon Colorstay overtime lip
color it looks like this it's got a red
end to it but what I'm going to be using
is the clear lip gloss side as a last
finishing touch I'm going to contour my
nose Marilyn would often contour her
nose to make it look much slender and
shorter so what I'm going to be doing is
creating a shadow on the tip of my nose
to create an illusion of any shorter
nose and I'm just using a brown neutral
matte shadow to do this the last thing
to do is add Marilyn's signature beauty
mark and to do that I'm going to be
using a matte Brown shadow from my
eyebrow kits and ever so lightly dabbing
a little dot just above my smile line
we're done this is a final look I hope
you guys enjoyed this this is definitely
a wearable like if you lose the beauty
mark in the wig I think it's really
really fun and really classy and just
very beautiful I think y'all would
photograph really well as well so if you
guys try to recreate this please tag me
on instagram my instagram will be at the
end of this video if you wanna go follow
me on that that would be great and
subscribe if you haven't already and I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see my next one bye bye
me and my mom are bit puffing obsessed
so she knows that I really really like
perfumes so my parents got me the chanel
Coco Mademoiselle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
