channel I hope you guys all well today I
have a super exciting video for you guys
I'm basically going to be creating a
look inspired by the new Tim Burton
movie called miss Peregrine's Home for
peculiar children I actually had the
pleasure of watching the movie and I
loved it so so much at the official
release date is on the 29th of September
I am so excited for you guys to see it
it's an amazing movie I literally love
anything to do with Tim Burton I love
all of his movies his illustration and
if you guys have been following me for a
while you know that I am literally
obsessed with anything to invert it and
today I am going to create a whole new
character inspired by the movie that in
the movie there's a lot of characters
and they're all different they all have
their own peculiar powers I thought it
would be really interesting to try and
create my own character with their own
special power but after watching the
movie I thought all the characters were
brilliant I thought the only character
that is missing is the one that sees the
future with their own eyes right before
them I feel oh be such a cool power to
have and it's a great opportunity to
play around with the eyes makeup wise as
well as illustration wise so the
character I'm portraying here is
basically the evil version of myself
like kind of like my alter ego my
character basically has no eyes as well
as a third eye on their forehead which
allows them to see into the future
I wanted my character to have a really
gothic and evil looking makeup I've had
a black smoky eye with a hint of purple
and a black lip and also I'm going to
have the face really chiseled and almost
sunken in this is the final illustration
I come up with I hope you guys like it
and now I'm going to recreate this look
on my face to begin the makeup I'm using
this matte purple shade from my sleep
divine palette in shade bad girl 596 I'm
using a big Real Techniques contour
brush to distribute the color on top of
my eyelid underneath as well as
stretching this out into my temple this
will be the transition and base shadow
of our makeup look I'm then using a
smaller fluffy brush to add a more
precision and build up the pigment of
the purple shadow next I'm reaching for
this matte black shadow from The Naked 2
palette and applying this on top of my
eyelid as well as underneath and again
stretching this out into my temple we
want this color to blend seamlessly into
the purple so take your time blending
this out
I'm now returning back to the purple
shadow from the sick palette and I'm
using this to contour with I want the
cheese to be really sunken in and almost
dead looking I'm then going to diffuse
the purple shade using a pink blush from
Too Faced returning back to the eyes I
decided that it wasn't dramatic enough
so now I'm just going back in and really
stretching out that black into my temple
moving on to the lips I'm using dead of
night by Kylie cosmetics so firstly I'm
going to over line my lips with the lip
liner and then I'm going to fill in with
the liquid lipstick now moving on to the
lashes I really want the eyes to be very
dramatic and all about the length I'm
then going to coat them with this white
liquid liner by NYX for that extra drama
and also so it looks like my
illustration to finish off the eyes I'm
also going to add two little white dots
in my inner corners as the eyes are done
you want to move on to the third eye
right on your forehead so I'm using my
Urban Decay browbeaten to map out where
my eye is going to be and then defining
the eye with my Ziva black kohl liner
now returning back to my purple shadow
from the seat palettes to replicate the
look that we created on our actual eyes
next I'm filling in the eye with a white
Kohl liner lastly I'm going to add some
false lashes onto my eye and again coat
them with the white NYX liner I'm also
going to take that white liquid liner
and I'm going to add some highlights
onto my face like the tip of my nose and
my cheek bones I think it adds a very
mystical and almost surreal look to the
face it really pulls the whole look
together
you
and this is the final look I really hope
you guys like it I think it's actually
quite easy to do which makes this look
great for last-minute Halloween makeup
so this is the final look I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and if you did be
sure to give it a huge thumbs up also
the link for the trailer of this movie
will be down in the description so make
sure you guys check that out I
absolutely love this movie so I know you
guys will too also if you guys could
have one peculiar power what would it be
let me know down in the comments below I
really hope you guys enjoyed this and
I'll see you very soon in my next video
bye
even get across forgiveness for my
wrongs I have just begun ain't no mercy
ain't no mercy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
