guys are all well
so today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial because I feel like I haven't
done a makeup store in forever for you
guys
so today I'm going to be doing this look
that I'm wearing on my face I've been
wearing this non-stop on my Instagram if
you guys follow me on Instagram but you
will know it's just like a really nice
neutral warm toned like autumn slash
full color makeup so if you guys would
like to see me do more makeup tutorials
in the future which I definitely should
then Leafers video huge thumbs up just
down below and subscribe if you haven't
already I also have a vlog channel you
guys I'll leave that any I so you guys
can check it out and I post weekly so
make sure you guys are subscribed I'm
going to be doing vlogmas this year so
get excited but yes if you guys would
like to see how to recreate this look
then let's get to it so to start off the
makeup I'm going to be using my master
prime by Maybelline New York just to
kind of have an even base underneath my
foundation and smooth out my pores I'm
then reaching for my NARS sheer glow
foundation this one is my favorite at
the moment it's just a really nice
medium coverage and it gives that really
nice glow to the skin so I'm just
applying that all over the face using my
Real Techniques stippling brush I'm then
taking my Born This Way concealer by Too
Faced this is again one of my favorites
at the moment it's just so great and
high in coverage if I'm taking this
concealer and I'm applying that under my
eyes and on top of my chin in any areas
where I get a little bit more redness
now I usually blend this in with a mini
Beauty Blender but I couldn't find it
someone's going to use the warmth of my
fingers that you tap this into my skin
now to set this in place I'm going to
use my master fix by Maybelline New York
and this I think is one of the greatest
and loose powders from the drugstore
it just gives such a flawless look to
the skin especially if you slightly
baked with it like I'm doing here next
to bronze up my face I'm using the Too
Faced sweetheart baked bronzer and I'm
just gonna use this to kind of contour
but not really just add a little bit
more warmth to the circumference of my
face like my cheekbones and my temple
I'm they're taking a smaller brush and
I'm actually going to contour my nose
with this I pretty much do this every
single day it just gives them nice a bit
of definition to the nose and I really
like how it looks now for Hilah I'm
going to use my makeup forever highlight
and this is such a gorgeous color first
of all it's so nice and cool toned which
I love and it just gives the perfect
glow to your face for my brows I'm going
to be using the brow precise by
Maybelline New York and I'm just filling
out my arch with this now moving on to
the eyes I'm taking my Urban Decay Naked
ultimate basics palette and taking this
shadow here I'm going to pop that into
the crease as a slight transition shadow
this is going to serve as the base of
our makeup I'm then taking this a medium
brown shadow and I'm popping that all
over the moving part of my eyelid and
also blending this into the transition
shade lastly I'm taking the third shade
which is this dark kind of like burgundy
shade and I'm just popping this on the
outer V's of my eyes and also slightly
blending this through the crease this
really gives the eye that really nice
definition and it gives it that very
autumnal bun Sienna kind of look I'm
then reaching for my Naked 2 palette and
I'm using half baked just on the center
of my eye so I'm just taking my finger
for the most pigmentation and just
dabbing this onto the center and also
blending it into my inner corners now
for the eyeliner I'm using the sleek dip
it eyeliner and this is such a great
eyeliner I've been loving out at the
moment it's really easy for application
and it's really really pigmented which
is one of the best things about it so
I'm just taking that and just creating a
very basic wind liner with this I'm then
going to finish my eyes off with mascara
and I'm using the tissue cloud by YSL
and I'm just applying this onto my lower
lashes as well as my top ones to blend
my fake lashes with my real ones lastly
for the lid I'm using the Too Faced
melted matte lipstick in shade cool girl
this is one of my favorite lipsticks at
the moment it's just such an amazing
color it's very wearable for every
single day and I just love it so so much
don't have my everyday makeup for fall /
autumn I really hope you guys like it
