filming another wall my family and I'll
be filming my everyday makeup routine
I've already done at this video a few
times on my channel but because my
makeup routine changes around so much I
thought I would film a new one so I hope
you guys enjoy this video and also if
you're wondering why I'm wearing this
hat it's because I've got a terrible
root so I'm just kind of wearing it to
cover it up so to start off I'm reaching
for my L'Oreal Paris infallible sculpt
contouring base foundation this is a new
addition to my makeup routine but it's
such a good foundation it's very very
covering but it's not heavy at all and
it also acts as a base for your contour
which is amazing so I'm just putting a
few drops of that onto my zoeva buffer
brush my skin hasn't been the best
lately I've got loads of like these
under skin pimples I don't know if you
guys can see you probably can because
I'm using a better camera today speaking
of my better camera
I basically upgraded my camera and I
don't really know how to use it so you
guys have to bear with me I'm pretty new
to this but I'm going to be filming some
videos in 4k because this camera films
on 4k which I'm super excited about
although I'm not too excited about the
rendering and upload time because it's
going to increase by like 10 times it's
kind of buffing that in next to cover up
those dark circles I'm going to be going
in with my room will wake me up
concealer and I've always wanted to try
this but I've never actually tried this
before which is so weird to me that I am
very late on the bandwagon of this
product but I do absolutely
so then I'm just blending that out with
my finger you're also going to go over
this nasty spot oh I've got a figure
that's as good as we're gonna get so
just know that wallet place I'm just
going in with my trusty Mac Studio Fix
powder this has become one of my like
holy ground products by far and I'm just
applying that with my Luck's cheek
finish that we've a brush just under the
I'm kind of like t-zone to set
everything in place it doesn't budge
throughout the day so then to go into a
little bit of contouring I'm going to be
using this pan stick by Max Factor and
this is a few shades darker than my
natural skin tone so it's perfect for
contouring I am going to film a whole
separate culturing video with cream
products in the future but yeah I
thought I would just basically show you
what I use for like the slightest bit of
contouring for everyday I then take my
Real Techniques foundation brush and I
just basically blend this out and you
have to blend it out really well or as
it's gotten look very weird
so once I've applied my contour I'm just
going back into my powder and just kind
of using that to blend it out even
further and kind of tone it down a
little bit I'm then reaching for my
blush and the everyday kind of blush
that I use is the Loreal the blush in
shade 163 and this is in shade nectarine
so I'm applying that with my Real
Techniques blush brush I've recently
been rediscovering the dual highlighter
I used to love this product so much as
you can start from the fact that I've
hit pan so basically I'm just using this
to highlight my cheekbones and the tip
of my nose so I'm just applying that
with my Real Techniques contour brush
because it's like the perfect shape and
size this is my skin a slash base makeup
complete and then I of course go into
the eyes and eyebrows so for my eyebrows
I've recently started using the Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani eyebrow kit
I love the shades in this because
they're so cool toned which is perfect
for my eyebrows and my hair I find this
is amazingly the winged liner brush I
just kind of like to darken my arch
because it's quite a sparse area of my
brow as well as the beginning here but
apart from that I don't really do much
to my eyebrows you guys moving on to the
eyes I've recently been using the Gwen
Stefani urban decay palette which is
absolutely amazing I actually started a
blog and I posted a blog post on this
whole range by one Stefani and Urban
Decay so if you guys are interested to
read that then I'll put my blog down
below here as well as the description
for my everyday makeup I don't really do
much with my eyes I just add a little
bit of definition through the crease I
do is I use this light shade called
Stark just to kind of lay down a base
and a foundation for the rest of the
shadows
after that I reach for a slightly darker
shadow which for example is the shadow
zone and it's this light brown shade and
I just start to sweep that through the
crease to kind of define it and I want
to do this because it makes my eyes
appear a little bit larger than they
really are and I take that same shadow
and just run that along my lower lash
line too I then go in with the bathwater
which is this really lovely gold tone
here I don't know if you can actually
see that and I take that on my finger
because I want a lot of pigment and I
just basically press that on the center
of my lid like so and then I go in
further with shade pop which is another
like rose gold shadow and then I just
literally pop that in the very center of
my eyelid did you finish the shadow off
I then go back in with bath water and I
pick that up on a little small brush and
I actually drag that into the inner
corner to kind of open up the eyes so
that is pretty much all I do for my eye
shadow and then I go in with my trusty
Sigma eyeline I mean using this a lot
for like my signature winged liner that
you guys always like and yeah basically
this is the product I use this is called
the Sigma 8 liner
that's the iodine and diet and I have
cost move on to the mascara and in
mascara I've been using a lot recently
is the wire self to chic like mascara
but I left it on the bus there not too
long and they're really really straight
which I already discussed in my previous
video so this mascara really gives me
quite a bit of length which I really
like and not many musk eyes can actually
do that so like a total stupid person I
forgot to record this but basically for
my bottom lashes I use a different
mascara and the one I use is the L'Oreal
lash false sculpt because of the mascara
brush it's actually really really good
for the bottom lashes because it just
catches every single lash really well
now moving on to the lips I usually
moisturize my lips before I apply an
inner product and recently I've been
using the born lippy by the body shop in
the strawberry flavor this smells so
good oh my god I literally could eat a
whole tub of this so then till I in my
lips I go in with my Rimmel cappuccino
lip liner this is actually such a great
match for my lips which is really
difficult to find actually and then I
usually use like a nudie or pinky lip
shade well be using recently is by sleek
and this is the lip VIP semi matte
lipstick and this is in shade private
booth Oh guys look what I've done to it
don't you hate when that happens and you
forget to roll it down before you put
the cap on
so that is basically what I wear every
day if I'm wearing makeup that day if
