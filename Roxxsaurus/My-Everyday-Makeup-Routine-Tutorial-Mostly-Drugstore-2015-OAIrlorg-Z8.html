this everyday makeup lug that absolutely
adore and I want to apologize right off
the bat for the lighting because I
started filming this video in the
evening and it's gotten much much darker
than it was when I started filming this
so there's going to be some slight
changes in lighting throughout this
video if you guys don't mind that too
much and if you guys want to see how to
get this look then definitely keep on
watching so first thing first I'm going
in with my hocus pocus illuminator and
this is by the run soap &amp;amp; Glory so I'm
just taking a tiny amount and I'm just
applying that to my cheeks and my nose
for my foundation I'm going to be using
at this Maybelline fit me foundation and
this is one of my favorite drugstore
foundations actually because it's quite
matte but it's not too drying and it's
got a really nice finish to it I'm just
going to be applying it with my Real
Techniques foundation brush so I'm just
applying that underneath my eyes and
wherever my skin may be having a little
bit of discoloration happening next I'm
going to go in with concealer I don't
actually have any drugstore concealers
at the moment because I've run out so
I'm just going to be using this Bobbi
Brown one and I swear by this concealer
but a really good drugstore concealer is
actually the Maybelline fit me concealer
as well I also really like the match
perfection one from I think it's from
Maybelline as well so that's really good
to set all that in place I'm going to be
using my super Glory one heck of a blot
powder I really really like this powder
because it's a translucent one until why
I'm just using my big Real Techniques
blush brush from lush I'm going to be
using this NARS one and this is called
NARS orgasm very rude name and I'm sorry
freezing and of a non drugstore product
but I do have a really good dupe for
this and that is very affordable and is
drugstore so that's the sleek rose gold
blush and it's very very similar to this
although it's not as shimmery I do have
both of them but my sleek one has
developed some legs so I can't find it
it's just
disappeared but they are very very
similar I'm just applying the same blush
with the same brush that I used for my
powder and applying it to my cheekbones
and the reason why I like this is
because this is so easy like it's got a
really nice color of a blush but it's
also got the shimmer to it which sort of
acts as a highlighter if you guys have
been watching my channel for a long time
then you will know that I'm obsessed
with highlighters so even though there's
some shimmering like sparkles in the
blush I'm still going to go ahead and
apply highlighter just because I love
highlighter so for the highlighter I'm
going to be using this Revlon bear it
all highlighter and this is called
lustrous lotion in shade pink a boo I've
had this for quite a while so I'm just
taking a really really small like sort
of Crum sized dot and I'm just dabbing
that onto my cheekbones on the highest
points just to give them a nice Juli
glow and honestly this is one of my
favorite highlighters so if they don't
make this highlighter anymore I will be
very very sad as you can see it just
gives your cheeks such a nice glow I
love it to finish off the face I am
going to contour a tiny tiny bit just
because I like that kind of definition
to my face so for this I'm actually
going to be using this mu a brow powder
I'm a big believer in crossing over
shadows and crossing over different
makeup products to apply them on
different parts of your face kind of
thing I'm not really too bothered that
this is a brow powder because this and
brow powder right here is like one of
the best contouring shades ever so I'm
just going to be taking that on my sleek
sleek on my Real Techniques contour
brush and I'm popping that just in my
cheek bone just to kind of contour it
and you know accentuate it you feel me
and this is quite subtle so it's not
like anything dramatic so it's still
very wearable for like everyday for
school for work it's nothing too crazy
but it just gives that a little bit of
difference I'm also going to contour my
nose a little bit first I'm going to be
using my zoeva luxe crease brush this is
two to eight and I received in that same
powder and tapping this onto the end of
my nose just to create the illusion of
the nose bridge being a little bit
taller and also the nose being a little
bit shorter oh and I also filled in my
eyebrows before I started just to save
time and I use the seven glory brow
artery for this I swear by this little
thing like this is so good now for the
eyes for my everyday makeup I never
really do anything too heavy I sort of
just stick with basics and neutral
shades and one of my favorite palettes
of all time to create my like
natural-looking
face for everyday is this sleek palette
and this is the eye divine or natural
6:01 and it looks like this so one of
the eyeshadows is crumbled up though so
I'm pretty sad about that but regardless
I still use this palette pretty much
every day and I use this shade here
which is like a oranjee warm shade so
I'm using my zoeva crease brush and I'm
just taking that orange tone shadow and
blending that into the crease and the
next show that I use is this quarter in
brown here and I lightly dust that onto
my same zoeva brush and then I tap that
further into the crease just to kind of
darken it a little bit and I find that
this is the easiest and quickest way to
create like a smoky eye effect kind of
thing and it just gives your eyes a
little more depth I really like doing
this
and just like that I achieve this smokey
eye kind of look with literally two
shadows in like two seconds and
sometimes if I want to take it a step
further I will go in with this really
nice champagne shimmery shadow and this
is by accessorize and it's called
subject eyeshadow in Ruby eight so how I
use this is I use this as a brow bone
highlight and I apply this on with this
flat brush so I'm just picking up some
of that shadow and then I'm just
applying that to the brow bone just
underneath my brow and then just
blending it out a little bit my finger I
also sometimes take this into my inner
corner just to open up the eye a little
bit and sort of attract more attention
to the eyes now for my line I'm going to
using this Maybelline New York I line it
in this little gel pot and I'm going to
be using my Real Techniques eyeliner
brushes for this so for my everyday
liner I usually do a winged liner so I'm
just going to be starting off the wing
and feeding that into the lash line
is it just me that can always get this
wing liner right because you're
right-handed and this one just always
turns out looking like a fiver or drew
on I knew this would happen now for the
lashes I'm going to be getting in with
my L'Oreal Paris false lash wings in a
midnight black I really like the wand of
this because it captures like your outer
lashes with this little bit here are you
kidding me
I just got this all in my hair for my
lips that I'm going to be finishing off
with velvet teddy and blankety by Mac so
I'm using velvet teddy first as like a
base color for the whole of my lip and
I'm using this brown eyeliner from
L'Oreal Paris just to kind of go around
the edges of my lips
and then I'm going back in with a velvet
teddy just to kind of go over the Linus
it's not so harsh and then to finish off
the whole thing I'm just going in with
blankety at the center of my lip so this
is the final makeup I hope you guys like
