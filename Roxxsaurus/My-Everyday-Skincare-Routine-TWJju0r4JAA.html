routine for you guys I haven't done this
video in a long time so I thought I
would film an updated one and show you
guys what products I've been using as of
now you're always asking me about my
skincare routine and I thought I would
just deliver what you guys want to see
so here I am just sitting down and
talking about what products I use on my
face I might also be doing an updated
haircare routine because a lot of the
stuff I've been using has changed so if
you guys would like to see that and then
definitely leave me a thumbs up so I
know so without further ado let's just
jump right into the video so the first
product I use in my routine which I use
like religiously is the list al cleanse
and polish hot cloth cleanser and this
is so good because it's like a cleanser
and makeup remover all-in-one it also
comes with this little muslin cloth
which you can use and it's just so much
more gentle than cotton buds on your
face and it's much more effective in
taking off makeup as well all you need
is a small pump of this and strangely
enough I really like the pump of this
product a lot of products I've used like
this in the past
they always squirt out too much on my
hand but this squirts out like the
perfect size for you so that just means
you don't waste a lot of product
masteries in this which is always a
bonus so this is really great because
it's suitable for all skin types and it
just means that anyone can pick this up
without having to worry it's also really
suitable for sensitive skin which I have
I have dry and sensitive skin and this
works perfect for me it takes off the
modes stubborn or waterproof mascaras
it's just one of those great things that
you can treat yourself where the great
thing about lazar is that they have a
lot of products that you can actually
combine so I also have this super skin
concentrate for light this is basically
like a little oil that you can pop over
your face before you go to sleep just to
kind of moisturize it but you can
actually even mix this with this or a
more radiant boosted kind of cleanse
which I find super great because I love
experimenting with different products
and mixing different things so basically
that satisfies my needs for
experimenting the next product that I
use from this range is the list o
instant boost skin tonic which looks
like this first or can I just talk about
how amazing the packaging is of the
packaging
such a nice color on a side note it's
very Instagram of all like my whole
themes like light blues and this just
fits my Instagram feed so much anyways
so the packaging is amazing because all
you have to do is twist this little cap
and this little squirty thing comes out
yes that's a squirty thing I feel like I
don't waste any product with this type
of packaging because the little exit the
product is so small that you have to
really make an effort to basically waste
product with this so on here it says it
revitalizes soups and tones for radiant
looking skin which is exactly what it
does it's perfect for any age group any
skin type it hasn't got any alcohol in
so it's not drying at all which is my
problem with most toners and with most
skin care products I always get dry
patches all over my skin because my skin
is quite sensitive and dry so it's got a
lot of natural ingredients it's got aloe
vera cucumber rose scented geranium and
natural source of vitamin E which is
just all kinds of good stuff so I just
pop this over my face with a cotton bud
avoiding the eye area of course and
again I do this twice a day in the
morning and at night before I go to bed
and another great thing about this
product is that it's also got a little
substitute so this is the same product
it's called dealer's our instant boost
skin tonic but in a spritzer form I
especially love applying this product on
my face in the mornings you know when
you just wake up and your face just
feels so puffy and like tired and like
really dry it's just an awful feeling
but I feel like just spritzing this over
your face it really works you up in
literally seconds and it also makes your
foundation apply really amazing and the
last product from this range that I use
for my everyday kind of routine is the
lizard skin repair moisturizer and it's
in this little pot and they do a lot of
different variations of this so they've
got a normal to combination skin and
they also have dry and sensitive skin so
the dry and sensitive one has more
borage and avocado oils I think I said
the borage word right is it borage I
don't know but this has more of that so
it's going to be more moisturizing for
the skin and this smells really amazing
it smells really natural and fresh so
everything you'd want in a cream really
except on the product it just says it
intensely moisturizes soothes and
protects and again I agree with the
description it really moisturizes my
skin
leaves it feeling really fresh and soft
and always like a baby's butt I
definitely recommend using this cream
it's just really soft and lightweight
it's not greasy on your skin at all
which a lot of products that I've used
in the past especially creams they feel
really like heavy and sticky on your
skin whereas this doesn't and it absorbs
into your skin really quickly so a lot
of you also wonder how I take off my
makeup and what I use so I alternate
between two different drugstore makeup
removers the first one is a very popular
one a lot of people rave about this and
this is the Garnier micellar water it's
got a no perfume or alcohol it's for the
face and eyes which is perfect another
one I use is the Nivea double effect eye
makeup remover and this is for all skin
types which again is perfect it's in a
slightly smaller bottle which just makes
it that little bit easier to carry in
your handbag and I actually use this one
I've got really stubborn I make up like
waterproof eyeliner and water proof the
scar the whole lot I feel like this
works just a little bit better to remove
eye makeup then the Garnier one even
though I really love the guy new one I
feel like this one is just a little bit
better at taking off a really stubborn
makeup another thing that I feel is
really important that you shouldn't
really neglect is your hands and your
hands tend to age really quickly
actually so keeping them nice and
moisturized is very important so for
this I tend to use the body shop head
protector and I love the new packaging
of this product I had a really cool
graffiti artist to design this packaging
which just says change and really nice
typography which I love but the product
itself is actually really amazing as
well you only need a little bit to go a
long way this is one of the products
that's really popular and I definitely
understand why so that is all for my
skincare routine and what products I use
a lot recently I hope you guys enjoyed
