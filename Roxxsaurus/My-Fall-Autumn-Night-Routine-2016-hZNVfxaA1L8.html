channel I hope you guys all well so
today I've got my fall / autumn morning
routine for you guys I'm super excited
for this video I've been meaning to film
it for quite some time now so I'm really
excited that it's finally here I went
around below for too long but if you
guys enjoyed this video make sure you
smash that here thumbs up also give this
video a thumbs up if you're excited for
Christmas and excited as I am because I
literally cannot wait I am going to be
doing blog list this year so make sure
you guys are subscribed to my blog
channel rocks or as vlogs and you guys
can expect a video every single day on
that channel from me in December because
I'm crazy but very exciting at the same
time make sure you guys are subscribed
to this channel as well if you are brand
new I would love to have you here but
without further ado let's just jump
right into the video so to start off my
night routine I get home and this is
usually after a day of filming in London
or just a day of events so the first
thing I do is I just take off my coat my
shoes and my hat and I head it straight
into the living room I don't know so I
turn on the TV and just go on my laptop
I have been loving watching a Vampire
Diaries recently I've rediscovered the
show I used to love it so so much yeah
I also got my laptop and just check on
videos and watch other people's videos
and reply to your guys comments after a
few hours of doing that I then realized
that the hunger has strucked I have
ordered some curry now I don't do this
every night but on this occasion it was
quite late so I just ordered some food
in and their skies the : does having a
little peak so I just eat my dinner
whilst watching a Vampire Diaries once
I'm finished I just head over to the
kitchen and just put my plates away into
the dishwasher and I decide to make
myself a hot chocolate
I then just like to light some candles
just to set the mood a little bit I'm
actually using a spaghetti because I ran
out of gas in my lighter so that's super
professional same with my candles and TV
in the background I just head over to my
laptop again and I match the editing my
vlogmas intro which I did with Matt I am
going to be doing vlogmas this yes and
make sure you guys head over to my vlog
channel rocks or his vlogs after that I
just head upstairs into the bathroom and
just take my makeup off with a wipe I
then also brush my teeth and then I hop
in a forest shower so for my shower
recently I've been using this new winter
collection from the body shop I've been
loving to use these so so much because
they just smell amazing they smell so
autumnal and wintery and they're just so
great to get you in like the autumnal
mood the frost and berries is definitely
one of my favorites so after I get out
the shower I decide to pop on some
moisturizer / body butter so I'm just
going to be using the body shop body
butters you guys can also get your body
butter personalized in select stores
across the UK and to find out where you
can get yours just click the link down
below and after that I decided to pop on
my glam glow peel off mask this is such
a cool color I've recently visited the
glam glow store on Mortimer Street in
London and they're doing this really
cool thing that if you guys mention my
name in store they'll actually give you
a free sample which is really cool after
that I head out of the bathroom and into
my bedroom and get straight into my
pajamas or a robe and I basically just
do my little like nightly skin routine I
don't actually do much all I do is I use
some face oil today I'm using the body
shop oils of life I like to switch this
up I don't really have any set skin
routine at the moment I feel like when I
use less products my skin is way better
I then braids my hair into a plaque
because I do this every single night so
that my hair is out of the way it
doesn't get tangled throughout my sleep
once I've done that I head straight into
my bed and I'm again going on my laptop
just because I love catching up with you
guys I'm basically constantly working
and I don't switch off until I go to bed
the young fire set me on fire but that
is all for my fall / autumn night
routine I really hope you guys liked it
and found it like cozy and kind of got
you in the autumn / winter II mood if
