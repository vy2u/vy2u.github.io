channel I hope you guys are all well so
today I'm filming a morning routine and
I'm really excited about this video
because this is the first morning kind
of routine video that I'm doing in my
new house
this means you guys will get to see a
sneak peek of my house before I actually
do my full house tour but before we
don't show it into the video I have a
huge announcement to make
and it's quite an exciting one because
you guys have been a big part of this
and the announcement is that I have
collaborated with a brand called date on
a little merch for you guys it's
basically a set of 4 different earrings
chosen by me and you guys over the app
called gobble you guys have been helping
me with the whole process from the
design right up to the packaging which
is amazing so you guys have really been
involved in this project with me but
this is what the little Bible looks like
once you purchase it and inside is a
lovely lovely little box and it looks
like this it is very Instagram or wall
if I say so myself will your help we
designed this little belly bag going
across the Daisy jewelry box
it just says Rock Soros X days in London
over like a nice marble background no no
I love love also had to do marble and of
course I love my copper which is why
there's a copper kind of like metallic
etext as well as like a nice detailed
line so once you take off the little
belly band
there's the Daisy London logo which is
on every single box and then inside the
products you get a little leaflet like
this and it folds out like this so you
get a nice little picture of me wearing
the earrings and then you also have each
of the earrings explain each of the
earrings has a nice little meaning and
symbolism behind it which is really nice
and you can read a little bit about that
on the leaflet and I really love this
it's just really really cute it's quite
a nice touch then moving on to
actual product the earrings come
attached to a little card like this
these are all the areas that you guys
help me choose I loved every single one
of these and you guys definitely did too
and you also helped me decide like what
colors of the metals you want it to be
so we have two Silver's we have one gold
and one rose gold which is really nice
so you can switch up the colors of the
metals and really play about with your
bird I think my favorite out of these
earrings is definitely the golden lotus
flower because I've already been wearing
these earrings before I even
collaborated with Daisy and I absolutely
love them I literally wore them every
single day overall I think this is a
perfect little set of earrings
especially for the mismatched kind of
earring trend that's going around
recently and Christmas coming up I think
this makes for a perfect little gift for
Christmas and it retails on Daisy
jewelry calm I really hope you guys
enjoyed this product as much as I loved
making it with you guys and I really
hope you guys purchase it or yourself or
as a Christmas present for someone if
you do then make sure you tag me on my
Twitter or Instagram I would love to see
it but for now let's get into the
morning routine let's go
so to start off my morning routine I
actually get up quite early most times
sometimes I have a little bit of a lair
but today I actually had to get up quite
early because I have a long day ahead of
me after rolling about for a few minutes
I finally try to get out of bed but nope
it doesn't happen maybe 20 minutes later
I finally decide to get out of bed the
first thing I do in the morning is
change my jewelry because if I don't do
it first thing I will just simply forget
so the night before I was wearing this
combination of the two earrings from my
new Daisy set so I decided to change it
around for the next day and combine my
lotus flower with my elephant earrings
once I have done that I'm now going to
make my bed I have to say this is one of
my least favorite chores if you guys
want to see how to DIY this really cute
reindeer pillow then watch my latest DIY
video because I show you how to do it
there once I've made my bed I literally
head straight into my filming room / a
dressing area and I do my makeup now
this is a really strange order of things
I know but as soon as I do my makeup and
I get ready I feel like I'm so much more
put together and I'm ready to conquer
the day so I'm just doing my everyday
sort of makeup for fall
I recently just did an everyday makeup
routine for autumn so that fall so if
you guys want to check that out and see
how I actually do my makeup and make
sure you head over to that video
once I've done my makeup I skip shower
and just brush my teeth and stuff like
that and then I just get ready because
I've had a shower the night before I
then head downstairs and feed sky
because she is starving bless her and I
then just head straight to my laptop and
just answer emails and reply to you guys
comments and watch some videos I often
watch TV first thing in the morning
I don't ascended to watch some YouTube
and I went to my boyfriend's Matt's
channel we recently just filmed this
video and it's so so funny I was
cracking myself up when I was watching
this most mornings I make my breakfast
by myself but this time Matt was really
kind to make me breakfast and he made me
a risotto and I just ate that watching
Pretty Little Liars after that I went
over to my social media I usually just
check what's going on and reply to you
guys if you guys want to follow me on
Instagram this is my handle here I
actually got this in the post and this
is insane like you guys I just really
wanted to show you this because it's
insane and I'm so grateful for all of
you the next thing I did this morning is
I headed outside and I actually shot one
of the outfits for my lookbook so Matt
helped me with that
but that is all for my full morning
routine I really hope you guys enjoyed
it and if you did make sure you smash
