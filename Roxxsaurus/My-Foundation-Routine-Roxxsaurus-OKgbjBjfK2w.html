my foundation slash skin base face
makeup routine sort of thing and I hope
you guys enjoy it this is actually the
first time I've ever done a video like
this about like my foundation routine I
decided to film this now because I'm
very happy with all the products that
I'm using at the moment and I feel like
they work amazing for me right now so
yeah I'm happy with my routine so I'm
gonna share it with you guys so
everybody let's jump right in so the
first thing that is an absolute must for
me is moisturizer before any sort of
application of foundation or concealer I
just find that the product glides on
much more smoothly and it just looks a
lot better so the moisturizer that I use
is the Nivea soft and I love this
product so much I have been reproaching
this for a while because it's just the
best product that I have used so far so
I take a little bit of that on my finger
like this and I just sort of dab it on
my cheeks and just anywhere that's prone
to being dry and I'm not wearing any
face makeup at the moment I'm just
wearing eye makeup and like the rest of
my makeup but apart from my foundation
obviously so just slowly packing that in
I find that patting motion works the
best because actually makes your pores
absorb the product rather than just
taking it on my kind of foundation that
I use is actually a mix of two different
ones because of my awkward skin tone at
the moment it's a very awkward face so
the one that I use is the healthy mix by
Bourjois as you can tell I've been
loving this product a lot it's so-so day
and the other one is actually a BB cream
and not a foundation and this is the
Misha perfect cover BB cream and it
looks like this it's a Korean brand of
BB Queens and just makeup in general and
I really really like it so what I do is
I just do a little pump on both of these
products onto the back of my hand like
this only a tiny tiny smidge just so I
can
mix it on my hand with the will walk my
fingers and as you can tell that's the
foundation that's the BB cream that much
different shades but after I mixed it on
the two with my finger just like this I
find that they're the perfect shade for
my skin no you guys are gonna think what
the hell is she doing concealer
obviously goes on first but I actually
don't do it like that I prefer doing a
thin layer foundation first and then
apply concealer on afterwards so I'm
just taking the foundation and I'm using
that as if I was using a concealer so
I'm just having that lightly under my
eyes and just any sort of imperfections
so we've got a few blemishes here you've
got cat scratch on my cheek for my cat
thanks cat so as you can see I treat the
foundation just as a concealer I don't
actually put it over my face because I
don't feel like I need that much
coverage so then I just use a foundation
brush like this and this is buying
makeup for you it's a very very cheap
brand but it works and all I do is sort
of slide that underneath my eyes and
blend it out they use my fingers
sometimes as well just because I find
that the warmth of my finger blends in
the foundation much better I only
basically use the brush to distribute
the product evenly now for the rest of
my face like on my cheek or the upper
lip or any sort of area I recommend to
do downward strokes because everyone has
hair on their face right and if you just
do this motion or circular motions you
really underline the facial hair on your
face I find that just makes me downward
strokes like this keeps the hair flat on
your face and doesn't sort of exaggerate
them so that's the foundation done and
very rarely I sometimes go in with a
concealer as well just to go over my
under-eye circles they are quite
prominent because of my olive toned skin
and the one that I reach out for is the
Yves Saint Laurent Touche Eclat and I
love this stuff so much it's very good
for the under eyes so because we've
already applied foundation and all that
stuff I'm only doing very very little
strokes underneath my eye like this
just to further get rid of the duck
pigment from underneath and then I
usually will just literally go in with
my finger just to blend it out and as
you can see that really brightens the
eyes even more now to set all this I'm
going to go in with a powder just to
make sure nothing sweats off throughout
the day and what I reach for usually is
the Rimmel stay matte powder but
sometimes I do go in with the powder
flies by benefit which looks like this
it's such a cute little packaging I
don't often reach for this because it is
quite high maintenance I mean it's very
powerful that one all over my black
jeans this is what I mean I don't
usually reach for this because it is
quite messy and I don't like that but it
does give a great effect if you don't
mind the mess so for the sake of this
video I am gonna use this I just tip
some into the lid and I'm taking a Mac
brush I'm not too sure which one this is
because the label has rubbed off but
yeah so I'm just taking that tapping off
the excess and I'm just running that
under me for my eyes and I feel like
this especially on photos or camera it
gives a very flawless effect it almost
looks airbrushed because of this powder
it gets a very very matte effect it's
got a pink sort of color to it so I'm
pretty sure that's great from your under
eyes because it balances out the color
so this is what the face looks like when
it's set and I think it looks great I
think it looks very matte and that's
exactly what I like to go for now to
give my face a little bit more shape and
dimension I usually reach for the
benefit Dallas I have been using this
quite a lot recently and I've basically
rediscovered
it's a really great product you can use
this as a bronzer or even a blusher
because of the universal color so I use
the Real Techniques blush brush to use
this because I find that the shape of
the brush it fits perfectly into this
little container so I'm going to go just
a little bit above where my cheekbones
start just to lift them a little bit so
that does look kind of harsh on camera
at the moment but we are going to blend
it out and I also drag it underneath
like this just to accentuate my draw
line a little bit so you can see now we
get this like sharp edge slash corner
which I like personally I don't know
about you but I'm also gonna sort of
contour the temples as well just to give
the face a little bit more of a bronze
effect it is someone and they're like
being tanned I'm actually going on
holiday soon guys so hopefully I get a
tan and do you expect a video because I
am going to be filming quite a bit and I
will be filming a vlog when I go so I
hope you guys enjoy that and stay tuned
for that I haven't mentioned I'm going
to Italy by the way I'm gonna go to Rome
Venice and Lake Garda with Matt and it's
gonna be great can't wait now for blush
I usually go for something warm toned
and I love anything that's like Gucci or
orange I think that it looks very nice
with my skin tone and my favorite blush
ever is the sleek blush and this is
called life's a peach 92 I love this
blush so much
it just looks gorgeous on pretty much
any skin tone I'm gonna use the same
brush that I used for my bronze I'm just
gonna dust off the bronzer let's go bare
to get rid of the product and then I'm
just gonna swirl that around and then
apply it to my cheekbone
this just gives a nice flush of like
healthy color to your face in the last
step is of course highlighter
I cannot go by highlights I am obsessed
and my favorite one recently has been
Christian Dior highlighter and this is
called shimmer powder in 0:02 and the
diamond I think that's what it's called
it looks like this I am unfortunately
broken the box and I've had this for a
while it's got this really small cool
toned one here and then the rest are
more warm toned but combined acting
they're perfect and I use this little
fan brush which is also by makeup for
you I just swore that around combining
all the shades and then I pop that on my
cheekbone on the highest point I even
take it down right now it's a little bit
as well just to highlight the bridge of
my nose and make my nose look taller so
that is my complete foundation routine /
skin base routine I will link all the
products that I've used in this video
down below in the description so I'm
gonna be gone for like a week or so so I
hope you guys can build that and in
advance I'm sorry that I will be
uploading March but do you expect a
video as soon as I come back I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and I
will see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
