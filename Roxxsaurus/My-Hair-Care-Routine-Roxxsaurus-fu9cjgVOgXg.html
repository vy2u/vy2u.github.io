sharing with you my hair care routine
and that's everything from shampooing to
hair dyeing as you guys may know this
isn't my natural hair color so I do diet
a lot and you guys always seem to ask
what head isaiah's and stuff like that
so today is the day that you find out so
for those of you who are purely here to
find out what head I use to get this
hair color I'm just going to get it
straight out of the way the one that I
use at the moment is the Garnier
Nutrisse ultra color and this is in
shade ice blonde and this is the one
that I'm currently using I have been
using various different brands of hair
dyes and I've literally tried every
single one in like boots and Superdrug
any any sort of hair dye brand that you
can think of I probably tried it so far
I can hands down say that this is
probably the best one yet it has
definitely got rid of any like unwanted
brassy tones and I'm at a constant
battle with getting rid of brassy tones
from my hair and it is very very
annoying having blond hair is very hard
to maintain it but this so far has been
great for me and I've been using this a
lot recently the one that I previously
used was a Schwarzkopf hair mask I
believe and it was in the lightest
blonde color and I've also used the nice
and easy hair dyes by Clairol I think
that's how you pronounce it and they
were really good at first then my hair
got really used to it and it didn't
really do much for me anymore
as far as toning goes I just use a
purple shampoo the one I use is the
provoke touch of silver one it looks
like this and this is the daily
maintenance shampoo you can also use the
weekly one I think it's much stronger
than nurse-in pigment wise but this is
basically just to protect your hair from
fading and going dull and it's got a
purple sort of pigment to get rid of the
like brassy turns from blond hair and
I've been finding this release why do is
I pop this over dry hair or like towel
dried hair just basically head that's
almost dry and then I leave it on for
like half an hour to an hour and I don't
know maybe that's damaging I don't know
if you're supposed to do that but it
works for me and it definitely gets rid
of the purple tones in my hand I do that
about once a week or so and I've been
finding that very helpful another thing
you can do to get rid of like brassy
unwanted tones in your hair is use a
toner I have also gone through all the
toners you can think of but the one that
I have discovered recently is like a
lifesaver since I started using this my
hair has gotten so much better in shade
and this magical product that I'm
talking about is the Schwarzkopf live
color XXL and this is the HD high
definition toner mousse which looks like
this this is about five to six pounds in
boots and I was quite skeptical about it
because I have got a long hair and I
didn't think that this would cover my
hair but to my surprise this has
actually got a lot of product in on the
packaging it says that for short hair
you can use up to three applications
like this is how much the product lasts
and then for medium hair it's up to two
applications and for long hair it's one
application but to be honest when I use
this I could probably get two your
applications out of it because there is
just so much products it's definitely
made my hair more cool turned which is
what I'm constantly trying to achieve so
I think that after using this product
constantly it will definitely make a big
improvement in my hair color now for
shampoos the shampoos that I use all the
time are the Nivea shampoos and I swear
by these because they're just they're so
good they're so nourishing and
moisturizing for your hair and it's not
good as well so this is the long repair
shampoo that these two are actually in
Polish but I'm pretty sure you can get
them in English as well my mum just
happened to get these two from Poland or
the photo shop I'm not too sure which
one basically this is perfect for hair
that's prone to breakage and also for
long hair so if you have long hair
that's prone to breakage and split ends
and any of that stuff these are perfect
and this is obviously the shampoo and
conditioner combo now sometimes I like
to switch up my shampoos because your
hair can get used to the products that
you use all the time so the ones that I
reach out for are the Gagne ultimate
blend conditioner and shampoo these two
are called these strength restorer and
they've got honey extract in it and it's
the best to strengthen and nourish and
protect your hair it's also for hair
that's prone to breakage and
just hair in general that's quite
fragile and this definitely applies to
my hair because of the bleaching and the
dyeing and stuff like that so these two
are literally perfect for hair that's
been chemically treated or anything like
that so between hair washes I often like
to refresh my hair a little bit so for
that I use a dry shampoo the one I use
is the batiste one and this is called
fluorescence is I really love this stuff
I have tried all the other like batiste
ones plenty plenty of them but this one
is by far my favorite because of the
floral scent and it's just perfect for
summer if it she smells like a perfume I
really really like this stuff if I want
to treat my hair a little bit more than
usual I reach out for the Garnier um
what's it called I think it's called
something like oh this is gonna bug me I
can't be bothered to go upstairs to get
it basically I know that it's a hair
mask by Garnier and it's like he
activated so you put on your hair and
then you can blow-dry it and it works
better so basically I like to leave a
hair mask overnight usually and I know
it's kind of like disgusting to put hair
products on your hair and then sleep in
it but you can always get one of those
hair caps and sleep in that even if you
don't want to UM sleep with a hand mask
on then you can always just put it on in
the morning if you've got nothing going
on and just work throughout the day
around the house and it's definitely
going to benefit your hair because it's
like constant moisture in your hair for
like the whole day and that's like so
good for your hair
now for heat I don't actually put any
heat on my hair apart from blow-drying
so the heat protection that I use is the
trailermate expert selection keratin
smooth heat protectant and this is the
heat protection shine spray it looks
like this um it's really good it smells
amazing makes your hair really soft and
also find that spraying this for your
hair makes your hair like easier to comb
out after you've washed it so I really
recommend this stuff now for haircare
like after I wash my hair I don't
actually use that much all I use is this
little bad boy and this is actually from
Asda as the zone brand and
it's a smooth nourishing and gloss
enriched serum with a Moroccan argan oil
so you can literally use any Moroccan
argan oil and it will do the same thing
pretty much so I just happen to need
this one because it was cheap but I do
really like it it does give a nice shine
to the hair and makes it much easier to
like brush out and limit your hair just
really smooth to the touch and I really
like that so this is all the products
that I actually use on my hair but
recently I have added a new addition to
the sort of like haircare routine and
it's some dietary supplements and this
is by Hairfinity I have been using this
uhm for maybe like a month or something
like that
and I don't know like I'm thinking about
making a video on like first impression
sort of thing or like um what I think
about it and how it's worked for me so
if you guys are interested in that sort
of thing then definitely comment down
below and give this video a thumbs up so
I know I have got quite a lot to say
about this product and my opinions on it
and stuff so I think I will make a video
about it but let me know what you guys
think about that so that is all for my
hair care routine I hope you guys
enjoyed this but before I go I do have a
very big announcement to share with you
