matte lipstick collection
I haven't meaning to do this video for
quite some time but I have just been
waiting to get a big enough like
collection to actually be able to film
this video 10 that makes me sound like
I've got like a hundred of MAC lipsticks
I love Mike lipsticks but I'd like a
number that I can actually use I'm
really happy with my small collection
because it means I get to use every
single shade and none of them go to
waste
I'll start off with my two red lipsticks
and the first one is Ruby woo which is
this really gorgeous crimson red color I
love this so much it's a matte lipstick
and I think this is great for all skin
types it makes your teeth look really
white so I really love this it's like
one of my staple Reds in my collection
the next one is a diva and I absolutely
love this color for winter and autumn
it's such a nice shade there's only a
little bit darker than Ruby woo as you
can see here but I like having these two
lipsticks to create a gradient for my
lip this on the outer corners and this
one in the center it just creates the
perfect gradient this is also a matte
lipstick which is great because I love
Mike lipsticks you can never go wrong
with a matte lipstick my next one is
stone and this is a brown lipstick and
it's also a matte do you guys hear a
recurring theme yet this is a new
addition to my collection I use this for
my gigi hadid makeup look and it's just
such a gorgeous shade I feel like Brown
is quite a different color to your
typical red which is why I like it so I
feel like this lipstick would suit most
skin tones but some people don't really
dig the whole brown lipstick thing
that's totally fine but I really like it
the next dark lipstick is the cyber one
and this is again our shadows not that
it's a satin this one's a satin so it's
a little bit more sheer than the matte
ones and it's not as drying as the matte
once again great for like the vampy lip
for winter and autumn I actually don't
use this lipstick as much as I thought I
would when I first bought it maybe that
is because it is quite so when you
kind of glaze
over your lip at first it can give you
like the dead look which is never good I
don't really know if I like this um it's
a nice shade I like it in the packaging
but I don't know if it suits me once I
apply it to the lip if anyone has any
suggestions on how to make this like
more wearable then let me know so the
next few are actually all just like
nudes which I like I I kind of wanted
two spectrums of the MAC lipstick world
I wanted really dark ones but I also
wanted to have some wearable ones which
is why I got like a few of the iconic
lip colors that everyone raves about I
don't actually have any Pink's in my
collection because utterly wear Pink's
I'm not too sure why I don't think they
suit me very well so I kind of tend to
go for either really dark or really nude
so the first one is of course the velvet
teddy I read about this very often like
everyone else on YouTube this is such a
great neutral shade it's like the Kylie
Jenner lip some people say some people
don't agree with that but I feel like
it's quite a Kylie Jenner lip to be
honest again it's a match so I've got a
really good lasting properties on the
lip and it's like a perfect like
everyday all-around shade really next
one is the creme de nude and this is a
cream sheen this is a really strange
color for me actually I thought when I
bought this I thought it would it was
going to be a little bit darker I
haven't using it quite a lot but my mum
has been stealing this from me as well
and I've had it for quite a long time
this one it's always shade I feel like
it makes me look a little bit dead so I
don't tend to wear this unless I kind of
just put it over the center of my lip to
lighten it up but that's about it the
next one is blankety and this is
amplified adorable that means I don't
know it looks like a satin lipstick
really quite close to you velvet teddy
actually if you look at them but this
one's a little bit more cool toned I
feel like this one's more like pinky and
this one's got a more orange e undertone
to it but I really like both of them
actually and this one is just a little
bit more wearable because it's not so
much and it looks much more natural and
my last one is faux and I actually have
to do pop this into this little
container long story short my dog
thought that the
l came to him even though it was to me
so my MAC lipstick came to my house
through the letter post someone just
posted it because it was quite a small
package and I was away and my dog ate my
lipstick he didn't touch any of the
products so I was able to melt it and
then deport it into this little pot so
didn't go to waste
but the packaging was completely ruined
I'm sure I showed it to you guys and it
was just oh my goodness it was
heartbreaking but I managed to salvage
it and I just tend to kind of use my lip
brush to apply it although it is quite
sad because it's not in the original
packaging which means I don't use it as
much as I would because I can't be
bothered to carry around a lip brush
with me everywhere so there's like eight
MAC lipsticks including the deep pot
down there I hope this video helped you
guys a little bit when you're choosing
your matte lipsticks maybe this inspired
you to go out and buy a new one to your
collection if you haven't tried out any
of these yet I highly recommend for you
guys to check these out because they are
pretty versatile if I had to pick my two
favorites for my collection it'd
definitely be stone and a velvet teddy
these two lipsticks literally just do it
for me
so I hope you guys enjoyed my little
matte lipstick collection if you did
then definitely don't forget to give it
a thumbs up and subscribe if you're not
already if you guys are checking out my
social media my Twitter Instagram and
snapchat or box auras same way it's
