makeup collection slash storage sort on
video after I posted a picture of my
vanity area on Instagram the guys have
been requesting for me to do this video
so that's why I'm doing it so quick
disclaimer though I do not have like the
biggest makeup collection out there it's
not as big as most youtubers but I think
for a person like me that a beauty sort
of blogger on YouTube it's a reasonable
amount and I like to collect my makeup
but still have a small collection so I
actually get to use every single product
rather than just have like thousands and
thousands of products that I'm never
going to even use up so yeah that's that
I hope this video doesn't offend anyone
I'm not trying to brag in any way I just
really like watching these videos maybe
you guys will see some products that you
guys want to try out before I get into
the organization of my actual vanity
area I recently found this app that I
have been finding really useful and I
only just joined it like a few days ago
and basically I feel like it's a very
very good way to organize your makeup so
because I have such little room in my
makeup storage area as you'll see in a
minute all of my makeup is basically
stacked on top of each other and
sometimes I forget what I have so then
act that I'm talking about is called
snaps it looks like this basically what
you can do is you can create your own
account I have mine on here and I just
called rock soros if you guys want to
follow me and basically what you do is
you just create shelves shelves of
products so you can name each shelf
blushes or brushes or lipsticks mascaras
that you want to organize you can
literally put in here and then
take pictures of every single product
that you have and then what you can do
is literally just go to your shelf and
you can view all the different products
that you have from that category so for
example a shaft I made is called blushes
and here are some of my blushes that I
actually own I haven't finished making
the Shelf yet because it will it should
take a while it's a really good way to
sort of share your makeup and people can
see what makeup you have see if you guys
want to check that up out it will be
linked down below and I'm finding it
very useful so you guys probably will
too so go ahead and follow me on there
so now you can onto the actual vanity
slash desk area the adroit angle is from
a shop called denim and they sell really
gorgeous furniture that's like Victorian
slash French style and I absolutely love
that style of furniture the chair that
you see alongside is actually a little
bit of a DIY that my dad did for me we
bought the chair frame from this vintage
store we had to repaint it white and
didn't have any cushion so my dad
basically remade the cushions for me so
I'll probably start on my left here
which is my lipstick stand and that's
actually from TK Maxx and they do all
different sizes but I figured I'd get
the biggest one so all of my lipsticks
can fit in so at the front I've just got
a few MAC lipsticks and then I've got
different brands all over if you guys
want to check out my lipstick collection
I will link the video down below because
I have done one and here I've got a
little drawer and I just keep random
bits in here just things I don't really
use like pencil sharpeners and random
primer and just things that I don't use
but I don't throw up then on the left
hand side here I've got my Garnier
micellar water this is the makeup
remover that I use every day so I like
to have it out and at hand so moving on
to the little box here this little
storage unit here that I keep all of my
everyday makeup is from the range it's
really handy because it's got this
little drawer but it's also got these
little like I don't know like spaces to
keep your makeup in this is really where
I keep all of my everyday makeup that I
use on a regular basis here I've got my
Bobbi Brown blush in
peony I really love this blush it's one
of my favorites then at the back I've
got a dual highlighter so I can glory
one heck of a blot powder and then a
gallon blush at the back and I've got my
two the balm products this is frat boy
by the balm and this is Bahama Mama
which is a bronzer then here I've got my
hocus pocus illuminator by soap &amp;amp; Glory
in this last section is where I keep my
two most used palettes so the first one
is the Naked 2 by urban decay of course
and then I've got my new tude palette by
the balm and in the section and the back
is where I have all of my face products
so I've got my highlighters and my
foundations this highlighter I've had
for ages could bear at all by Revlon and
it's so so nice then I've got my two
Bobbi Brown Foundation sticks this is
the Max Factor ages Alex a two-in-one
foundation then I of course have the fit
me foundation by Maybelline the healthy
mix a bourgeois foundation and then at
the end I've got my Watts up highlighter
by benefit in this little drawer down
here is where I keep all of my
miscellaneous bits that I don't really
use so I have my green concealer here
this is from our CBT professional
cosmetics I don't really know I have
this from and then I have my Nivea lip
balm my makeup Academy under s your skin
highlighter and this is actually a
really good highlighter I really
recommend it then I've got this a
highlighter by Rimmel and it's called
the wake me up instant radiance touch in
shimmering sand I've got my miss 4000
high tan so fine I don't really use this
because it's too orange for me so I just
keep it here then I've got a Clarins lip
balm I also keep my revolution a bronzer
and highlighter sort of kit in here as
well then I've got my Larenz quod
palette I keep this in here as well
because I don't really use it because of
the colors of the shadows they're not
really my everyday kind of shadow choice
oh man it's not going to go back in now
moving on to the right hand side and
this is where I keep my brushes some
pencils this is a mixture of eyeliners
lip liners lip like tints so few things
that I really like from this set
is my shooing eyeliner by the balm then
I've got my bad gal benefits coli nur
Clarins lip liner in prolene got this
Too Faced color bomb moisture plumping
lip tint a lip liner by essence what
else
this is brow archery by super glory and
I have my Rimmel scandaleyes felt tip
liner got my ear setter on to shake
laughs and see laughs and then moving
down to this section here I've got my
two Estee Lauder daywear plus creams
this is a little sample size and then I
also have full size then on the left I
have my benefit powder flage and I just
keep that here because I really like the
shape of that I think it's a really cute
product but it doesn't fit in this
little bit here so I just keep that on
top of my lash bubblegum lip scrub so a
few of my brushes are obviously by Real
Techniques as you can see these are my
favourite rushes of all time this one is
the blush brush then I've got my contour
brush my foundation brush and I've got a
few detailer brushes as well and this is
from the precision liner set I have this
massive fan brush this brush makes me
laugh in particular because it's so big
it's like that doesn't how is that
supposed to fit on my face and I really
have many brushes by Mac but this is the
one of the only ones that I do have and
this is like this angled brush I don't
really know what it's used for and the
label has rubbed off so I don't know
which number this is I also have a Bobbi
Brown brush I don't know what this is
again because the label has rubbed off
this looks like a powder brush or like a
blush brush to me most of my brushes are
like no-name brushes really like this
one here I just got like a really cheap
website can't remember where it's from
but I like to because of the gold
detailing and I also have this little
double and brush by the balm and this is
called a woman empowerment and it's got
a little pointed brush which is like a
pencil shape and then it's also got an
angled brush and my brush holder is
actually a plumper and this is from home
base I believe again the drawer just
here is just filled with random chisel
that no one needs to know about on to
the right I've got this little container
where I keep my cotton buds to remove my
makeup and I really like this because
it's got like
this woollen effect on it now for the
main part of this video is my big draw
of makeup so this draw may look a little
bit jumbled to you guys but it makes
perfect sense to me so the actual draw
was completely empty when I got this
vanity area so I had to get this little
divider which I got from TK Maxx so in
this little section here I've got all of
my mascara then in this one towards the
right I've just got little round small
products like concealers eyeshadows
blushes I've got my Bobbi Brown
concealer here then I've got my Calvin
Klein eyeshadow in snakeskin silver I've
got one of my favourite eyeshadows and
this is by accessorized and it's a baked
eyeshadow got a random elite concealer
some Sigma products here my Revlon
Photoready blush and then here I've got
my two lip balms by Clarins
I really really like these they're very
moisturizing then to the right I've got
more miscellaneous products I've got
some little chubby products I've got my
benefit hoola lip gloss and then I've
got my free collection lipsticks in the
back in this little section I'll just
literally keep really small random
products it doesn't really have a theme
or anything I was basically just trying
to make do with all the space I have and
just make every space count and then
I've got my benefit Dallas bronzer /
blush and then I haven't you've set the
wrong bronzer here these are some of my
eyeshadow palettes here they're mostly
sleek and it was the left I've got my
two sleek blushes and these are from the
new collection this is in shade French
rose I've got an eyelash curler which I
don't really use this is from H&amp;amp;M once I
get this thing out the way I'll show you
the rest basically this is the Too Faced
BB cream and it comes with like a little
brush but because it wouldn't fit in my
drawer I hats and put them little brush
to the side and it just looks like this
behind that I've got three more seat
blushes these are my favorite blushes
because they're just powder this is in
rose gold this one is like the peach
this is one of my favorite blushes of
all time and the last one I have by
speak is this one in shade flushed
towards the left of that I've got this
little Mac concealer trio a 17
highlighter this is the
BRIC then I have my brow this way
eyebrow gel by Rimmel and only for that
I've got my Sigma palette which looks
like this I don't really use it too
often so I kind of just keep out at the
bottom in the middle section I have my
Rimmel stay matte powder and also the
anyway powder then I have this
Maybelline New York dream map moves my
number 7 Foundation and MUA eyebrow kits
to random lipsticks this is by Christian
jaw and this is by the balm here I've
got my Elizabeth Arden eyeshadows then
my ESET laron eyeshadows a Lancome
lipstick because it wouldn't fit in my
little stand then I've got this little
Clinique tester of a foundation and my
NYX eyeshadows
so basically when I need something I
just have to rummage through all of this
because I don't really have that much
storage area available so I just have to
pile up everything on top of each other
and then just dig through all of it when
I tried to find something then twas the
right of my vanity area I've got this
little table and I got this from a car
boot sale for like two pounds and I was
so chuffed about it
then I've got a little VARs on the side
just to add a bit of decoration and then
to the side I have this little glass
platter where I keep all of my perfumes
then a little brush set that I have on
the side is actually from a vintage
store so I know some of you are asking
about it and where I got it from so yeah
I got it from a vintage store I don't
know if you can get that exact brush
anywhere else then on the side I've got
a few of my favourite nail polishes and
those are the very end nail polishes and
then on the far right I've got a little
Christian Dior perfume which is a
vintage perfume bottle so that is all
