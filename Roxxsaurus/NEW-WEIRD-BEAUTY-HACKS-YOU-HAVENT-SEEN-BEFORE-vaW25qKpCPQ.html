coke oh god maybe I do a guru hey
everyone welcome back to my channel
today I am joined by very special guest
my best buddy now we obviously have
meaning to some of you for so long like
this is especially tragic open and
serious about the tears you know
yes so basically today we're going to be
doing
I won't come up over this toilet what
was really going to be showing you what
test well roughly 10 hacks that allows
you and hopefully if I haven't seen that
yet but you have they're quite like a
hundred yeah there's a strange and I
haven't really seen them anywhere just
yet so I really hope things gonna be
some I know that you guys haven't seen
yet if I do a video in property it's
gotta be half so you know she cheer I'm
another low - aye Cap'n yeah so without
remedy against the video so hack number
one is using pseudo cream as a face mask
I never thought that this would be a
thing but because Taylor cream is
antiseptic this is great to treat any
bacteria on your face and clean out your
pores with pack number two is using a
balloon to apply your foundation with
yes that's right a balloon so you want
to blow up the balloon into a size that
is quite similar to that of a beauty
blender so the balloon can really get
into those small areas of your face and
then what you wanna do is just apply
your foundation and just start grabbing
that in with the balloon and because the
balloon is made of rubber of course it's
not going to absorb any extra foundation
which means that in the long run if you
decide to use a balloon you're not going
to waste any foundation like you would
with a beauty blender but now hack
number three is using jelly powder as a
lip tint so what you want to do is take
a cotton earbud and basically just dab
that into some water to moisten it you
want to then dip it into the jelly
powder and start rubbing this onto your
lid so the jelly powder has staining
properties which would say in your lips
a really nice pinky color
the next pack is the storing the uses
under so what you can actually do is you
speak in direct the little container
from inside it depositing your
Beautyblender whilst you're traveling
this will make sure that your funds
doesn't get damaged and you also want to
make sure that when you're traveling
that you're used to blend that is dry
because this will make sure that it
doesn't get mouldy inside as it can
collect bacteria if it's wet music see
how dirty my Beauty Blender is I thought
this was a really nice and useful hack
so the next pack is using a cucumber to
remove your makeup now this is probably
the most crazy attack I've ever seen but
when you actually think about it it does
make a lot of sense seeing as a lot of
makeup remover product do include
cucumber as one of the ingredients it's
really good for your skin in general
because it's quite moisturizing but it's
also really good at breaking down the
makeup so if you ever run out of makeup
remover you can always use excuse number
the next pack is adding a beer into a
spray bottle and spritzing that through
your hair this works really well to add
body and volume to your hair because the
youth in the BM reacts with the hair and
in turn makes it much more fluffy and
just really volumize then the last pack
is for plucking your eyebrows and
achieving that perfect shape so what you
want to do is take a product that is
much lighter than your skin tone such as
Layla's doing here and what you want to
do is to basically draw out this stencil
of how your perfect Rauschenberg
you then want to take your tweezers and
start plucking away any of the hands
that are in the white area this is going
to shape the brows really nicely whilst
ensuring that you're not plucking any
really important hands and that is all
for this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed I'm super sorry about the outro
not being like it usually is but my file
actually corrupted so I have to say
goodbye like this regardless I hope you
guys enjoyed and if you did make sure
you smash that thumbs up just down below
and subscribe if you are new and I will
see you very soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
