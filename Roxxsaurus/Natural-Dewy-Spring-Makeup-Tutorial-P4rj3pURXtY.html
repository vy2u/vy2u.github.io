foundation by Bourjois this is the
healthy mix one
this isn't shade light beige it's this
kind of tan of is great for olive toned
skin which is what I have so I find this
really really easy to match my skin so
I'm just going to pump it out on the
back of my hand and I am going to then
dab that onto the places that I want to
cover such as my dark circles or any
sort of blemishes I usually put some
foundation on my eyelids as well just to
kind of balance out the darkness of
their or the redness and you always get
those little nasty bags that you want to
cover up so then I'm using a blush brush
from makeup for you and actually find
this brush really helpful to blend out
foundation because it's quite small so
I'm just going to sort of dump it in
what I like about this foundation is
that it's really really jewy and it just
has a really nice glowing finish next a
little contour and give my face a nice
sort of brown sunkissed effect and for
this I'm going to use the bourgeois
chocolate bronzer this is really really
nice and it's got a tiny shimmer to it
but it's not too crazy so I really
really like this and to apply it I'm
using a Bobby Brown blush brush I
believe so to contour your face and also
give it a little bit of a tan defect all
you have to do is create like a three
shape on your face you start up in your
temple you go into your cheekbone and
then you bring your back out make sure
you blend this out really really well
sometimes I also like to take a small
fluffy brush like this and use my
bronzer to just sort off contour around
the nose a little bit and what I do is I
dab the powder on the tip of my nose
like this and what this does is it
creates an illusion that the tip of your
nose is a little bit taller than it
really is and in turn it makes your nose
look a little bit pointy er and just
have this cute little butter shape to it
and I also like to contour on the sides
as well only ever so slightly just to
give an illusion of your nose being a
little bit smaller and this is not gonna
do a drastic sort of change like it's
not like plastic surgery or anything but
it does give a slight sort of them semi
noticeable effect now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take my Bobbi Brown
blush and this isn't shade peony it's
just a nice little pink shade it also
had a bronzer on the other side but it
completely crumbled out so yeah I'm
going to use this and the brush that I'm
using is a matte brush she said this
done how I just hit myself a face it's a
matte blush brush but I'm not too sure
what number so sorry about that so I'm
just gonna dust that over the cheek sort
of carving the shape of my cheekbone
next I'm going to take my benefit what's
up highlighter this has been a favorite
this month I love it so much it just
gives the nicest sort of like goddess
dewy glow thing going onto your face
it's amazing all you do is sort of swipe
it on there you can see that and a
little bit on the tip of my nose maybe
even the Cupid's bow to highlight it a
little bit and then on the other side
has got a handy little sponge so all you
do is you sort of go over it with a
sponge so it's not so harsh and it's all
blended into the skin a little bit
better so moving on to the brows I'm
gonna fill this bus bad-boy going on
here and to do this I use the Maybelline
New York eyebrow pencil this is um the
like lightest one they have I'm not too
sure what shade that says it's very like
waxes got a waxy consistent
see so airplay is really easily unlike
most eyebrow pencils if your eyebrows
tend to be a little bit dark and you
want to lighten them then this is also
good because when you go over the darker
hairs it kind of lightens them
automatically okay so next I'm gonna
move on to the negative palette to use
on my eyes this is my favorite palette
like all-time and it's just a really
really nice but like glowing and natural
looks because of the neutral toned
eyeshadows now I want the eyes to look
very natural but I do want it to have
that continuous glowing sort of effect
throughout the whole makeup so that's
what I'm going to use T's as a blending
sort of transition color and we're going
to pop that in the crease with the
fluffy side of the brush next I'm going
to take half baked and I'm gonna pop
that in the center of my eyelid next I'm
gonna take pretty cool give this one
here and I'm gonna pop that on my brow
bone just to highlight it a little bit
I'm also gonna take booty-call and just
dab it in the very center of my eyelid
really nicely gonna blend that into the
half baked you can pile a little booty
cool because it's quite a translucent
shade so the more layers you put on the
more pigmented it will come out now I'm
taking the flat side of the brush and
going in with T's at once again I'm
gonna line my lower lash now because I
don't want too much darkness in the face
or the eyes today I'm going to be opting
for a brown eyeliner and one I'm using
is my number 7 is just the brown 10 yeah
just a Kohl eyeliner so I'm gonna be
using that to further line my lower lash
line ever so slightly
for mascara I'm gonna be using at the
Maybelline mega plush mascara and this
is great for those of us who are not a
10 out of 10 in the lash department if
you know what I mean
my lashes are very very tiny I've
already got some mascara on today only a
tiny bit from earlier but I'm just gonna
go over the top of one more coat
so this is the final look you can
totally leave it like this and go
without a vape stick but I'm gonna add
something a little bit more for it so
I'm gonna go with the gosh lipstick and
this is in shade sweetheart one six one
it's a really really nice like nude
slash pink shade I'm not too sure how to
describe it but it's gorgeous
and it's matte so it looks really
natural so I'm just going to slightly
dab that on the center of my lip but a
tiny tiny stain of color so this is the
final egg I hope you guys enjoyed this
