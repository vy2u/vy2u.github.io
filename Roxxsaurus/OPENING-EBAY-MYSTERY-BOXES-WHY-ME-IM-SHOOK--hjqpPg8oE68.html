today I have a very exciting and kind of
strange video I basically went onto eBay
and I ordered three different Beauty
mystery boxes now I have no idea what's
inside them I spent different amounts on
each of the boxes to see what I could
get for my money and I've seen this
video done by so many youtubers already
so by no means am I saying this video is
like original but I just really wanted
to see for myself what you can actually
get for 10 pounds 30 pounds and also 50
pounds from eBay in a mystery box if you
guys are brand new to our channel make
sure you guys subscribe come and join
the dinosaur family and also don't
forget to click the notification bar
button to stay notified of every time I
post a new video but without further
adieu and let's get on into the video
okay so this is the first mystery box
now this cost me 10 pounds it's actually
quite heavy although it's a small box so
I'm really excited to see what's inside
I'm kind of scared it's a really strange
feeling because although I'm excited to
be opening things that I don't know
what's inside I'm also kind of a bit
worried because at the same time this
has come from a complete stranger I have
no idea what could be inside it could be
like living bugs but well I know so yeah
let's just dig in I'm so nervous guys
I'm actually really nervous okay I am in
the box this is what's inside I haven't
even had a look myself so you guys get a
first sneak peek okay so the first thing
I see is this what is this oh it's a top
okay so this is a top it says Chicago on
it it's a very sheer top it smells a bit
weird it's not new I can tell it's been
used it hasn't got a label or anything
it's not like the worst top ever but I
personally wouldn't wear it it's not
really my style
it doesn't smell of like cleanliness
it's really hard to describe it smelled
like it's been used and then
not washed I don't know this is really
gross but that's the first thing the
second thing that's in here is a little
Primark container for makeup so this is
a beauty organizer it's brand spanking
new
I think they ripped off the price but
I'm pretty sure it was 450 so let's just
open it I actually really needed one of
these because I just got another one of
these Alex drawers in my room so I need
way more like organization I'll actually
know this was one pound 50 it says on a
little tag there that's quite a nice
thing to receive so I'm not mad about it
now the next thing I see is a little
dove gift kind of set or maybe like a
travel kit I wonder if these will be new
or use they kind of looks like they're
new ok so inside there's two deeply
nourishing washes by Dove and then also
like a mini do drone sells pretty handy
it's quite a nice thing to receive again
and I'm pretty sure these are new I mean
let's let's see if this seals like
broken ok the seal is broken so I don't
know these are new no this one doesn't
have a seal either so maybe they just
don't have seals I'm not too sure but I
probably would use these just to be safe
ok moving on the next thing I see oh my
god they send me tampons but the packet
is open oh my god that's disgusting
why would you send me tampons in a
beauty box oh wow oh my god I'm actually
really worried what else is in here now
ok Oh gross first of all second of all I
have a daisy Marc Jacobs body lotion
this is the type of thing that you kind
of get for like a perfume let's see if
it's open okay so this has definitely
been used it it seems like it's full but
there's no safety seal on it so I think
it's been used they still clunk over the
tampons like a box of tampons with a few
take out like why like at least send me
the full tampon kay
now the next thing I see are two tea
light candles and like a really minty
green kind of color oh they smell battle
like this now the rest of the things are
kind of miscellaneous so I have two
sweets in here which I'm definitely not
gonna consume because better be safe
than sorry then I have what are these so
I have no idea what this is but there's
two of them a kind of heart
what is it let's read on the back so it
says it's you activate it snap the metal
disc back and forth inside the gel pack
to start the reaction interesting right
how do i how do i snap this then I can't
snap it guys I'm trying to snap them but
nothing's really happening
they're already hard so that's kind of
weird
and then the next thing is a pair of
shades which are also used because the
lenses are all scratched up but they
look like they're probably from like
Primark or something I'm just gonna put
them on real quick that's the look
that's the look okay then the next thing
we have is a watch which does not work
then we have a little pouch like this
which is really cool I'm gonna open it
up and pretty sure there's a bracelet
inside again Noorie my sort of tastes
now don't get me wrong these are very
pretty I really like the colors but I'm
not really much of a bracelet wearer and
especially jewelry like this I just it's
not really my taste so I probably
wouldn't wear this but it's still pretty
nice we then have a single Rimmel London
powder blush in shade pink rose again
I'm pretty sure this has well in the pan
now it looks brand-new but doesn't it
seal so I don't really know if that's
been used or what but there it is I then
have a lollipop wrapper with no lollipop
inside it literally just the wrapper
then I have a I'm pretty sure this is
like a pearl headband kind of like this
and then the last two things are a
little Hart keychain which looks like
that and then
a spider necklace I actually quite like
this it's something I definitely would
wear when I was like 13 or so I was
going through like a gothic phase it's
very tangled but yeah this is something
I totally would have worn back then okay
so that is everything for the 10-pound
box it's all empty I cannot get over the
fact that I was sent tampons and a
lollipop wrapper in that box I think the
best things that I have gotten from that
box is this little thing which I'll
actually get to use and this which I
probably won't use but this is a Marc
Jacobs body lotion which I guess has a
little bit value to it but it's still
been used so I probably won't get any
use out of it okay now moving on to the
second box let's hope we're going to get
something a little bit better because
for this one we actually paid 30 pounds
it has a little rip inside it did come
in kind of like a plastic kind of
wrapper over the top so I haven't even
opened this yet when I saw the packaging
I was like right this is one of the
mystery boxes I'm not gonna open it hand
on her I have not seen anything inside
just yet so let's open it together
really really excited for this one
because the packaging looks really nice
so it looks quite promising oh okay
so there's a little card at the top that
says thank you let's open this up oh
thank you so it says a thank you for
buying this box I hope you have so much
fun discovering all the goodies inside
if you love them please would you kindly
leave good feedback thank you I've never
gotten a card from an eBay seller so
that's like a really nice touch
now inside is just bubble wrap so let's
take that off oh my god guys look at
this
this is so cool everything's wrapped
individually and it's pink oh my god so
we got a bunch of this stuff which is so
fun but everything is packaged like this
this is so cool okay the first thing I'm
going to open is this item here it's
kind of shaky I have no idea what it
could be this is cool so this is some
classic false nails just a set of false
nails and these are brand new which is
good something actually quite useful too
next thing we have is something very
thin and very like small I think it
might be like a bookmark or something oh
okay so it's more nail stuff these are
just little like self-adhesive patches
for the nails so this is what they look
like that was she really cool I didn't
even know these things exist now the
next thing is probably a nail polish
from what I can feel
haha so I knew this was a nail polish so
this is just an mu a white nail polish
so the next thing is I think that's cool
so the next thing is a collection mm
lasting color gel liner okay what's this
I'm pretty sure this is gonna be an
eyeliner of some sorts okay so this is
an NYC color and shine for the lips it's
just like a lip pencil I guess and again
it's brand new
so all good I'm actually pleasantly
surprised by this box so far let's see
what this is this looks cool it's like a
little lipstick I guess this is from the
brand kiss you can't say I've ever heard
of this brand but the color looks pretty
nice oh my god wait what is this okay oh
okay so this is like an acrylic powder
for nails I don't know if you guys can
see that but the whole of the actual
packaging is covered in the powder so
I'm wondering is this new it's probably
not right so what's the next thing oh
okay so this is the NYC I to I highlight
and contour for your eyes it's like a
very small eyeshadow palette next we're
gonna see what this is this is
definitely not my color this is
definitely way too dark for me so I
probably wouldn't get any use out of
there slow and another nail polish okay
so this is an NYC
now glossies the next thing I'm pretty
sure is another nail polish oh I
actually really like this one and this
is what it looks like it's actually the
favorite nail polish of mine from this
whole bar oK we've got four items left
I'm pretty sure a lot of them are gonna
be nail polish it's never gonna run out
of nail polishes now this is just like a
green color it's not really a color I
would wear and we have another nail
polish from what I can feel this is a
nice color so this is a collection hot
looks fast dry nail polish it's like a
really nice bright
blue color and the last one is another
collection now published in bright
yellow which is gonna be so nice for the
summer so this is the very last product
of the whole box so this is a Constance
Carroll whole eye liner although there's
no safety seal it does look new doesn't
look like it's been used at all so think
it's safe
this one's safe to use so that is all
for the box it's all empty
I mean we've gotten quite a lot of nail
polishes in this box
I just got literally one two three four
five six six different nail polishes do
I think this box was worth thirty pounds
probably not I definitely feel like I've
wasted my money just to little bit with
this one but obviously not as much as
the first box even though the first box
was only ten pounds but you know what I
mean now and this is the last box and
ironically it's actually the same size
as the 10-pound box
it feels really light as well so I
honestly feel like unless there's a 50
pound banknote in there I'm probably not
gonna get my money's worth let's just
crack it open okay so first we have some
bubble wrap to protect everything oh
okay I see all the products oh my god
okay so the first thing I see is a
Lancome makeup remover this is a
double-action
eye makeup remover is it open or touch
openness I don't know how to open this I
think this is one of those childproof
locks we have to like press it down and
then twist it yes oh and it's got the
seal which is very promising it means it
hasn't been used which is good so far
this box is looking really good now the
next thing I see is a wire cell eyeliner
Wow
oh my god I did not expect to get such
good products in this box so I have a
Couture eyeliner noir minimal matte so
this is what it looks like let's open it
up the box is a little bit squished I
don't know if you guys can see that but
this is the eyeliner I've actually tried
this eyeliner before and it's amazing
now I would never be able to tell if
this was used or not but it seems pretty
full so we're just gonna give it the
benefit of the doubt so the next thing
we have is an hourglass ambient metallic
stroke highlighting palette whoa okay
this person knew me even though they
didn't know me but they knew me though
inside is this little number whoa okay
look at that that's a snazzy packaging
I've never really tried any hourglass
product oh my God look at that that way
that glow OH
oh my god oh my god did you guys see
that this literally just came out the
pan that was so close my heart right now
I was about to shatter into tiny little
pieces across my carpet it looks like it
has definitely been opened because some
of the highlighter is like kind of on
this part of the packaging but it
doesn't look like it's been swatched or
used so we're all good and the last
thing we have in here is a Too Faced
better than sex mascara this is what my
favorite mascara oh my god so the
packaging is a little bit squashed again
but I love this mascara and it doesn't
seem like it's been used I mean I'm just
gonna open it and see no I think we're
all good I don't think it's been used
whoa hey this box was a success I feel
like I did actually get my money's worth
I am definitely gonna use all of these
products especially the hourglass
highlighting palette because it looks
insane so those are all of these three
mystery boxes that I'm gonna open for
you guys today I am so pleasantly
surprised I mean I'm disappointed in
many ways too but I'm also pleasantly
surprised by the 50-pound box it's
actually got really decent products that
I'm definitely gonna get to use I mean
the 10-pound box wasn't really that much
of a waste cuz it's only ten pounds but
still like if someone bought that and
they were expecting like some decent
things you're probably not gonna get
anything decent I really hope you guys
