I'm going to take my other Decay
eyeshadow primer potion I'm using like a
little tester like this which has four
different ones and today I'm going to be
using the one called Eden which is this
one here I'm just taking a little bit
about my finger and I'm popping that all
over the lid just to prime it and make
the eyeshadow stick a lot better next
I'm reaching for my Naked 2 palette
which looks like that
and I'm going to be using foxy as a
all-over shadow on my lid I'm using the
Naked 2 palette brush that came with it
so I'm really really patting that on
there just to get the most dense color
onto my eyelid and just slowly and
gradually building up the opaqueness
next I'm going to reach for the shadow
called T's which is this one here and I
am going to pop that in my crease
next I'm reaching for it never power and
the one I'm going to be using is the
Sigma brilliant and spellbinding and the
shadow that I'm gonna be using is called
balmy and it's this one here which is a
very matte and bronzer shadow so I'm
just popping that on the fluffy end of
my naked 2 palette brush and I'm going
to further exaggerate the crease with
this let's sort of blend it up into the
brow bone I'm taking the thin end of the
nikah 2 pallet brush and using the same
shadow from the Sigma palette I'm going
to pop that underneath my waterline
and then I'm gonna take the Avon single
eyeshadow this is called white pearl and
it's just a pearly white shadow and I'm
going to use this to highlight my inner
corner nothing at return to my nickel 2
palette and I'm going to be using ydk
which is this shimmery bronze shadow
right here and I'm going to be popping
that in the crease ever so slightly just
to add the look a little bit more
shimmer and it's not so dull and matte
next I'm taking my white eyeliner and
this is by Sigma in shade unclouded and
I'm going to run that through my
waterline just to brighten up the area a
little better
next we can be positivity I like that
and the one I'm gonna be using today is
by miss 40 it looks like this and it's
called studio lash the meow
now that my eyeliner is done I'm going
to go back to my naked 2 palette and I'm
using the brown shade that I used
previously I'm going to use that to
create a very thin shadow on my lower
lash line to sort of imitate a shadow
that will be created with the width of
my lashes as I did on this side as you
can see it almost looks like my
eyelashes are so heavy that they are
making a shadow on my bottom lash line
this was a very popular thing that
Hollywood stars would do back in the day
especially Marilyn Monroe and I think
it's just a very cool trick next we can
move on to get eyelashes and the mascara
that I'm gonna be using today is the
vegetable difference mascara it's got
two and it's got like a little fiber
thing to make your lashes longer but I'm
not gonna be eating that because I am
planning on using false lashes so I'm
just popping a few coats of that on I
already have some scar on my lashes from
earlier but I'm just gonna add a few
more coats so it learn nicely with my
false lashes next I'm going to put my
second eyelash on and the one that I'm
using are the carrot eyelashes 100% of
human hair I'm not too sure where I got
this from but I'm sure you can google it
and find them if you like these ones so
much you're gonna go off camera and put
these on because I'm not very good at
putting these on at all especially on
camera so I'll be right back so I'm back
and my eyelashes are on and now we can
move on to blush and blush I'm gonna be
using is called serene and it's by Sigma
I've been using a lot of Sigma products
in this video because I literally just
we discovered them they were sitting in
the bottom of my drawer forever now and
yeah so I am using this blush and it's a
really gorgeous color very neutral but
adds a nice or she to your cheeks so I'm
using a real techniques blush brush and
I'm popping that on the apple of my
cheek
next somebody's my governed your
highlight which looks like this and I'm
going to use a fan brush to sweep that
on the highest point of my cheekbones
enough for the fun part the lips I'm
going to be using this body shop
lipliner and I feel like that's all I
need this look I'm not going to be using
any lipsticks I really like how this
liner looks just on its own so I'm just
going to be using that
so that is all for this makeup look I
