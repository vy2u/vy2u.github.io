channel I hope you guys well today I
thought I would do something slightly
different to why I usually do and I
thought I would form a Twitter Q&amp;amp;A for
you guys since we are almost at 1
million subscribers I thought it's time
for you guys to actually get to know me
a little bit better it sounds crazy I
make videos for you twice a week but I
feel like you guys still don't really
know me like on a personal level so
that's why I thought I would start
making these Q&amp;amp;A videos and I hope you
guys enjoy them so I've got my laptop
down here with all you guys's tweet if
you guys would like to be part of my
next reticulate I'm going to film in the
future and please make sure you follow
me on Twitter
whitening is just rocks or same way it's
but here I got my huge laptop here and
without phone dude let's just crack on
with questions okay so the first
question comes from at one line 9x babe
and they're asking how old are you I
know they look pretty young and a lot of
you don't expect me to me to say but I
am 20 years old
I don't probably must have you think I'm
like 60 or something but yes I am 20 I
just turned 20 on the 14th of March I do
feel really old ok the next question
comes from a user who I can't pronounce
their username so I'll just leave all
the comments as like a little caption
and they are asking who's your favorite
youtuber this is such a hard question
because I watch so many people on
YouTube but some of my favorite to watch
are definitely Gabby from velvet guys
Sabrina from love life and make out
Leila rose who else is there
keep I'm arts yeah and a graveyard girl
I just love them so much and who else
you asked I watch Beauty crush Shane
Dawson he's just so funny
Emily Callum I look for videos I love
her blogs I also really love AJ
clementines videos he is an amazing
YouTube and he really deserve so much
more credit so please check him out
I'll leave all the youtubers that I
mentioned down below and if I missed any
out I'll also pop them down in the
description next question from
underscore Dallas underscore Bay and she
asks how many kids do you want to have
when you're older and honestly this is
something I don't like to think about
because I mean I do one have kids one
day
but I'm only 20 so like the thought of
giving birth to another here
it's kind of like gross I'm basically
not mentally or physically prepared for
that kind of trauma I'm joking it's not
a trauma but you know I mean like that
is just terrifying back when you guys
were in school or if you are in school
in science class do they ever show you
like videos of giving birth like a woman
giving birth because that scarred me for
life thank you so much science class I
just love that experience like it has
stuck with me for life
thank you really at Jupiter Affleck asks
I think I'm saying that right you can
only travel to one place only once in
your life where would you go and why oh
god um only travel to one place what's
the like I can't ever have a holiday
again right um probably like Japan it's
always been one of my biggest dreams to
go to Tokyo on holiday since I was
really young I used to be like obsessed
with anime and all that I mean I still
love it my favorite anime is like Death
Note so just make a mental note I'm
getting carried away there but I still
love it so much I just don't have time
to watch it anymore which is pretty sad
because I'm not like with it anymore I
used to love kpop I so love j-rock and
Lee's like different genres and all this
stuff to do with like the Asian culture
but now I miss it if you guys know any
good like kpop bands make me down below
because I'm like out of it I'm out of
the scene like I snow all the bands
I just don't know any I'm not I'm not a
cool kid anymore the same person also
asks why is your favorite TV show don't
even get me started I absolutely love
Pretty Little Liars
I'm obsessed and I'm literally waiting
at my computer for the next season and
you know that picture when they're like
Sat is like a skeleton that is me
waiting for prettier lies about the
moment I'm also really loving znation
which is when I'm watching with Matt I
love how to get away with murder I think
I still need to watch the third season
though and what else do i watch I used
to want Vampire Diaries all the time
nice to be obsessed with it but I
haven't really caught up with it and
only love originals as well the
originals is amazing and Breaking Bad oh
my god Breaking Bad broke my heart like
I love Breaking Bad I love Jessie and I
love Heisenberg like oh just they need
to make a second season they really do
the next question comes from s panna
seven one zero
I think I'm saying that right and she
asked how long have you and your
boyfriend been together so we have been
together for about two years now almost
two years but we knew each other for
ages before that um I've known him since
I was like 14 and he was 15 but we
didn't like know each other like
romantically we were just friends and
only two years ago we started dating the
next question is from this username here
and they say do you plan on getting
married soon okay so this is something
that I obviously think about we talked
about it with Matt but we don't like
plan on getting married anytime like
soon I mean we're only 20 so bear that
in mind I don't want to get married like
super young and we have only been
together for two years
so we kind of want to like take it slow
you know but yeah that's that I do want
to get married one day just just not
today
you know at mariska one Briana I think
I'm saying that right oh my god so bad
at karate news but she asks well you
have Matt record your reaction was he
hit one in subscribers I think we all
want to be in the moment with you yes
yes yes I want to do a one thing
subscriber video and I want Matt to film
my reaction to it which I think will be
so cool and also plan on doing a huge 1
million subscriber giveaway so let me
know if there is something you'd like to
see because I'm going to do like her
makeup giveaway so let me know what kind
of brands you would like to see in this
giveaway I'm thinking like urban decay
stuff because of decay
amazing let me know what you guys would
like to win the next question comes from
Olivia Brooks and she asks can you show
a picture of when you were little okay
brace yourself I have two different
pictures of me at different ages so the
first one is this one here so this is
the first picture of me this was at 8
years old look at me I am a fetus Rock
Soros right here and this is the second
picture this makes me laugh even more
because it's me with two teddy bears and
I look like a pimp it is like I'm I'm
holding two teddy bear so this makes me
laugh a lot and I think I was about 11
or 12 years old here but yeah this is me
when I was young at dolls asks who's
your favorite mingos character I don't
know why but I'm always drawn to like
the villain characters in movies for
example it mingos I absolutely love
Regina George she's like my favorite
character in the whole movie and then in
like real life
I love Allison even though she's a
really big but I still really love her
so yeah that's that I just seem to be
attracted to villains the most at shake
it up Angela asks what do you like most
about being a youtuber this question
made me smile because I just thought
about you guys and it's just so amazing
how all of you support me and we don't
know each other personally but I feel
like all of you are my best friends and
we'll like this online community /
family and it just really means a lot to
me that I have you guys and yeah that's
just my most favorite part about it I'm
just connecting with all of you and
making new friends I think that's what
it's all about another question from
@king mary is what is your favorite song
at the moment
yeah that's my favorite song Oh
the next question is from Missy Aaliyah
and she asks can you speak your native
language for us on camera I don't know
what to say you should have told me what
to say
okay taste moaning look summer and Lee
mum oh just relax
oh my voice changes doesn't it when I
speak in Polish it changes like the
sound I'm gonna why but it's really
strange anyways there you go but all
your polish people out there you guys
have been asking me for so long to say
something polish so here it is at
blindsighted Horan is asking what is by
g2 star youtube channel so it's a
mixture of a few things I first was
bored one summer and I thought wow like
there's so many people doing YouTube it
seems like such a cool thing to do like
in your spare time so I just started
doing it and I was also really inspired
by my friend keep I'm archaea and also
promise fan she actually commented on
one of my early videos that I did as
like a response to her video and it kind
of really inspired me to actually start
making videos for real like the high
comment just really boosted my
confidence kinda thing and I thought wow
like she noticed me this was so cool so
I started making videos after that this
question is from Daniella gÃ¶ran gÃ¶ran
I can't pronounce I'm sorry but she asks
if you have to get a tattoo what would
you get and where would you get it I
actually thought about getting a tattoo
and I wanted to get a tattoo just on my
wrist and I wanted it to be an outline
of a lotus flower a lotus flower has a
lot of meaning to me but I wouldn't want
to get something really big I'd only
want it as an outline like a very dainty
outline that you can barely notice but I
knew it was there so one day maybe
have the guts to actually do it and the
last question is hey Liv or Spangler
for those who don't know hey live in
Spain live are the ship names of two
different couples from the show pretty
little liars and oh I'm going to
disappoint a lot of you guys but I do
really love Spain love and I'm sorry
it's like betraying the original couple
but I don't know just something about
them really works me obviously apart
from when that day happened and then he
did that thing and yeah that was awkward
that is all my Q&amp;amp;A I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I am trying something
a little bit different on my channel
it's not a video that I'm usually film
but I hope you guys enjoyed it
regardless and I hope you guys got to
know me a little bit better I am going
to be doing a giveaway when we hit 1
