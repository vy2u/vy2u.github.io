liars themed I went onto Twitter to ask
you guys where you wanted to see like a
pretty little eyes thing to makeup
tutorial and so many of you have been
saying yes and that you can't wait for
me to do this video so a very excited to
finally be here and filming it for you
guys so today's video is kind of like a
makeup tutorial in the form of a tribute
because I have been growing up with
brittle lines for so many years and now
they have finally come to an end I am
very sad and I'm sure most of you are
too so today I thought I would kind of
do something for the show and you know
pay my respect this is always like the
show is dead well technically it is but
but you know I just pay tribute towards
the show because it has such a big place
in my heart and since I love every
single character I thought I would do
like a makeup transformation to try and
make this face of mine look like other
characters now I'm glow saying I'm going
to be the best time but I'm going to
give it my best shot if you guys love
