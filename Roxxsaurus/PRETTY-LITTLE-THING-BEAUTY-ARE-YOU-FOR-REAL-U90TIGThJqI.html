disappointing I mean dad for boy cold
and they want that fallout back what's
up everyone and welcome back to my
channel so in today's video I basically
I'm gonna be testing out a bunch of
makeup from a pretty little thing now
the other day I was just shopping for
clothes on that and I came across at the
Beauty tab which I actually wasn't even
aware that it existed did anyone else
know that pretty little thing did Beauty
cuz I literally had no clue and I went
on there and they had so many cool
products so I basically just went on
there and I bought everything so here I
have a palate after palate after palate
I literally have all of the palettes
that they had in stock and obviously I'm
not gonna be trying them all in this
video because that would be a lot of
makeup but I did just think that maybe
it would be a good idea to buy
everything just to kind of show you guys
at what they do have and then just kind
of choose to test out what tickles my
fancy if you guys enjoy testing makeup
videos that do give this video a thumbs
up and also let me know in the comments
below what other like testing one brand
makeup tutorials you'd like to see in
the future I have already done quite a
few I'll have a whole playlist down in
the description so you guys can check
those out but if you guys want to see
anything else then do let me know in the
comments and if you guys are new and
have never seen my face before and do
come and subscribe come and join the
dinosaur family well without further ado
let's jump into the video okay so here
is my little pile of goodies now I want
you guys to guess you have three seconds
to guess how much all of this makeup
cost me cos I mean it did make quite a
dent in the bank account okay so all of
these products right here cost me a
total of 113 pounds which is kind of
pricey but at the same time you'd whoa
almost drop at the same time you do have
a lot of products like you have so many
different palettes and one lip product
they let you just only had one lip
product so the first palette we're gonna
be taking a look at is and this one
right here so this is called the caught
your eye palette now let me just say
this first I absolutely love the
packaging I think it's so cool like it's
so reflecting and holographic and it's
so pretty little thing
so this palette right here
fifteen pounds now it has got 35 at
different shades of eyeshadow so let's
open it up and take a look inside oh
it's got a lot of Fallout so this little
thing right here is obviously like the
protective seal for all the eyeshadows
but underneath it it's got like so much
little fallout of all of the eyeshadows
which just isn't ideal I don't know if
you guys will be able to see it from
this far away but there's like so many
little bits of Fallout everywhere so I
don't really know what that says about
the palette already I really hope it's
not gonna be too like full LT if that
makes sense now the first thing I notice
is the brush the brush is just obviously
not gonna be very good it's just one of
those double-ended like sponge brushes
which no one ever uses let's be honest
anyway he's back to the palette there is
35 different shades and I feel like
there's a lot of shades in this palette
that I probably wouldn't use like I
don't know there's nothing that kind of
draws my attention and is like wow
that's so different there's like a lot
of like earthy tones a lot of like dark
colors which I don't tend to usually
wear actually there is a good mixture of
like shimmery and matte colors in here I
would say but this palette is definitely
something that I have seen a lot of
times in the drugstore so it's not
really anything new or special that's
for 15 pounds I guess it's not the worst
I mean you do get 35 different shades so
that's quite good
the next product I have is this now this
is actually an eyebrow kit so inside you
get three different eyebrow powders one
highlighter and two eyebrow wax waxes or
wax I don't know anyways so this is what
it looks like inside now again I can see
the fallout straight away that's quite a
bit of it just underneath like the seal
with this you also get some eyebrows
stencils and also a tweezer now I don't
know if that's a bit gimmicky but it's
there if you want it and this cost at
twelve pounds which I guess that's
alright for like three different shades
and you also get all this random stuff
so I don't know they then have another
eyeshadow palette this is also the quote
your eyeshadow palette however
this one there's only 12 different
shades this did cost 10 pounds so it's a
lot less but then again you are getting
like less than a half of the shade so
you might as well just get the larger
one which costs 15 pounds and you get 35
shades this is the selection of
eyeshadows and I'm not gonna lie the
inside kind of makes me think of like
Barry M eyeshadows I'm not really too
sure why maybe it's like the packaging
the selection of shades is quite nude as
well so I do like the colors personally
now obviously I'm not gonna judge it by
the packaging and the colors are really
pretty so I might actually end up liking
this the next product I got is this
right here which is the essential
collection so inside there is nine
shadows two highlighters two contour
products and also three eyebrow powders
so this is kind of what it looks like it
has a lot of different like powders and
things so you could definitely get like
almost half of your face done with this
palette which i think is quite good this
did cost at 15 pounds so I feel like it
is kind of on the pricey side especially
for what it is now again we have quite a
bit of fallout right here I don't know
if you guys can see it from this far
yeah I'm kind of just not liking the
fact that it's already falling out even
in the packaging so I have no idea what
the shadows gonna be like next up we
have this which is the ultimate face
palette so inside there is 40 different
eyeshadows two lip glosses one blusher
one highlighter and one bronzer let's
crack it open ah wow that looks kind of
impressive you know but at the same time
it kind of reminds me of like children's
makeup do you guys get that vibe I don't
know why again with the brushes come on
pretty little thing you should know that
no one uses these so yeah we have quite
a lot of like lip products we've got
some face products and we have
eyeshadows so with this one I actually
kind of preferred this selection of
eyeshadows better because there's some
shadows that are light there's some that
are dark and there's even some colors so
I feel like there's a bit of everything
for everyone next up we have a
highlighter palette so this cost at
twelve pounds and you do get six
different shades so let's crack it open
and take a look oh okay so the pants are
actually a lot bigger than I thought
they would be there's quite a different
selection of shades we've got some like
champagne sort
we've got some highlighters for like a
deeper skin tone and we also do have a
lilac color for those of you who
actually are a little bit more
adventurous with highlighter and
actually like to wear color with this
one I actually don't see any full light
which is really a promising but these
folks do we have is this so this is
called at the forever flawless face
palette so inside there's 12 eyeshadows
at two blushes two bronzers and two
highlighters so let's take a look oh
well that's disappointing
okay so inside we literally have a
cracked and open all that is is not
meant to be a bronzer it kind of looks
like an eye shadow but it's completely
like cracked inside the packaging it's
all like smashed and chipped in the
corner that's really not good as it
again we have those two amazing brushes
these are literally so good like
everyone who loves these brushes keep
making them and then we have a bunch of
different eyeshadows I actually kind of
like these there's like some red some
poppers a teal that's kind of good I
like that
that's a nice selection of eyeshadows I
have to say I do like that but come on
this unacceptable I do realize that this
probably happened in transit so I don't
really blame them for that but at the
same time when you're buying something
for like twelve pounds and you're making
a big order you kind of expect it to
come in one piece so maybe they should
have like packaged it up a little bit
better at the end of the day all the
products came in is literally one of
these bags with no bottle wrap it was
literally just like a hard block of all
the pallets at the very bottom of the
bag so they weren't really that
protective that's just one thing to kind
of keep in mind when you're ordering
makeup from website I promise I'm always
done with the whole part so the next
product we have is this which is the
face compact kit it comes with two
bronzers one blusher and one highlighter
so this is what it looks like inside I
kind of like that yeah so we've got like
matte bronzers they're not too orange
from what I can tell there's one shade
of blusher and kind of one highlight
which actually doesn't look that
shimmery so we'll see how I go mother
and the very last product
is this which is the only lip product
that they actually have on the whole
website so this is the pretty little
thing X project two lip map plumping
primer so this is designed to make your
lips tingle make them feel a little bit
bigger and this did cost 12 pounds for
such a tiny product I mean I kind of
expected it to be a little bit bigger
from the packaging this is how small it
is so this better be good cuz for 12
pounds it's kind of Diddy so that was
the breakdown of all of the products I'm
now just gonna go and pick the things
I'm gonna test for this video okay so
for today's video I think I want to try
out this palette right here which is the
pretty little thing the four works
ultimate face palette which is the one
that pretty much has it all I really
like the selection of shadows in this so
I thought I'd give it a go okay so first
of all I'm gonna take this a peachy sort
of color on a big fluffy brush and just
run that through the crease I'm really
hoping that it's actually gonna show up
because they don't really seem that
pigmented when i swatched them hmm okay
I guess it's kind of showing up so
that's a good sign
I thought picking up the product I'm
looking at the palette there isn't too
much fallout with this palette in
particular so I am very glad about like
so I really do want to make a mess of my
face today I feel like the more you
layer these eyeshadows are the better
they get but they're not that bad I have
to say I'm kind of feeling this yellow
color
I might just pop that through the crease
as well okay so the yellow isn't really
showing up that much and that's kind of
what I already expected with it like I
expected this palette to have some
shadows that are a lot more pigmented
than others it happens a lot with makeup
palettes especially when they're from a
brand that isn't really specialized in
makeup and for a brand like pretty
little thing obviously they do not
specialize in makeup they are a clothing
brand just like a sauce which I have
also tested out their makeup and I feel
like when a clothing brand is trying to
do makeup a lot of the time it's not
gonna be as good as like at the
drugstore that's just my personal
opinion though I feel like
and also be a little bit overpriced then
drugstore is anyways next up I'm gonna
take this eye shadow right here it's
kind of like a bronzy sort of shimmery
color animal is just gonna take that on
my finger and apply it all over the lid
you know what it's actually quite
pigmented now that I'm applying it with
my finger and this eye shadow also feels
quite creamy whereas the matte shadows
just feel with that tiny bit more chalky
I'm then I'm gonna take this slightly
more yellow shimmery color on my finger
again and I'm just gonna pop that in the
center of my lid yeah I kind of expected
a little bit more from this shadow it's
a little bit more understated but that's
okay I'm gonna try and lighten it up
with this white sort of matte color
right here damn I really thought this
was gonna work I really thought that
adding the lightest shade of the pallet
just in the center will just you know
make it pop but it didn't really do that
I'm just gonna take one of the darker
Browns that sort of color to see how
they perform it looks pretty damn
pigmented on the brush so we shall see
so I'm just going to apply that into the
outer corner whoa
okay that is pigmented but look at that
fallout though I mean damn Fall Out Boy
cold and they want that fallout back so
this is the locus so far I'm just gonna
trying to get rid of that fallout by
rubbing it away luckily we managed to
get it off so it's all good so this is
what the finished eyes are look like I
mean this poly is okay there is
definitely a lot of fallout as some of
the eyeshadows are a bit over here some
of them are amazed in my honest opinion
I honestly don't think I would actually
pay fifteen pounds or twelve pounds
whatever this cost because it didn't
really Wow me I mean it's fine for maybe
like beginners but when you're kind of
like a makeup lover like me I feel like
you just expect something a little bit
more from an eyeshadow palette you get
me so I'm now just gonna apply some a
liquid liner and a mascara
and I'll be right back so now that my
eyes are finished I'm now gonna move on
to at the face makeup so for this I'm
gonna be using at this palette right
here so this is the a face compact kit
which has a bronzer blusher and also the
highlighter so
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take
tippy honest they kind of look the same
so I'm kind of gonna just sway towards
this one and hope that this is the
lighter shade so I'm just gonna pick
that up on a little angled brush like so
and also it's got a mirror which is
quite good and literally just go in to
my cheekbone you know what I actually
thought this was gonna be like really
really pigmented up to the point where I
thought I was gonna have a brown line on
my cheek however I'm actually glad that
I did it it's a little bit more like
wearable and I feel like you can build
it up if you want to and it is like the
perfect shade like I would say that this
is a really good contour shade because
it's not too warm toned and it's also
not too ashy which is really nice I mean
look at that contour that looks so
natural I'm also just gonna pull that
into the forehead and temples you guys
and know what's up obviously absolutely
obsessed with this product will 100%
recommend it to you guys because I feel
like you do actually get your money's
worth the pans are quite big and I mean
just look at that blend it just looks so
flawless now I'm gonna move on to
highlighting so for this I'm gonna be
using at this palette right here which
is the one with the six different shades
so for my glow today I think I'm gonna
go for this highlighter right here which
is the lightest shade of the whole
palette so let's just pick that up on my
brush and I'm just gonna swipe it
straight on to the cheek oh wow
this is so good I feel like highlighter
is the one product that I love
throughout all of my testing video it's
like whatever brand it's from I usually
really like the highlight of the most I
feel like it's just one of those
products that you can't really go wrong
with I'm also gonna try and the slightly
darker one as well just to kind of see
at what sort of shade that is oh wow I
feel like this one's a lot more shiny is
that just me okay I'm obsessed with that
highlighter if I can bathe my whole body
in here I probably worth so we should
probably move along I'm not gonna take
the lip plumping lip balm thingy and
just apply it to my lips let's put it to
the test see if it actually does
something it did cost it 12 pounds so I
do have a high expectations for it it
does
really smell of anything okay so as I'm
applying it it's kind of got like a
scrub oh I just tasted it it doesn't
taste good
Oh oh my god it's burning my lips whoa
I just burning my tongue as well cuz I
tasted it no no no no no this is not how
it's meant to go also I feel like I
should mention that my lips are kind of
chapped at the moment and there's a
lovely cracks in them so this literally
feels like I'm pouring salt into the
wounds it's so Bernie I guess it means
it's doing something
do they look any bigger I feel like it's
not really doing anything it's really
Bernie like really really bad II the
only way I think I can describe this
feeling is if I took like a bunch of
different spices and like cinnamon and
lit just grinded it all over my lips
that's kind of what it feels like maybe
it's just like the sensation it's
definitely like causing blood flow I
feel like my lips do look a little bit
more pink than usual maybe but in terms
of making them bigger or anything I
don't think it's really doing much oh I
actually forgot to apply blusher so I'm
gonna take this palette and admission is
gonna pick up the blusher from this
palette and just pop it onto my cheek
that is actually like the perfect amount
of color and it's a really pretty shade
too I feel like it just brings my face
back to life and lastly for my lip I
feel like I should test out one of the
little lip gloss see things from the
palette so I'm gonna take one of these
amazing little brushes I don't think I
can actually use this it's this matter
for lips or eyeshadow I can't even tell
okay change your plan I'm going to use
this little applicator which is honestly
a girl's best friend let's be honest I'm
gonna take this one
I feel like excuse you I feel like this
one right here is gonna match my eye
color more so I'm gonna just take that
on the little brush very professional Oh
my lips are still really burning so I'm
gonna take that and apply it I feel like
I never use lip glosses I'm just such a
lipstick girl is anyone else like that I
just can't get along
lipglosses for some reason okay so this
is the lipgloss applied I'm actually not
hating it I honestly didn't think I
would like it because like I said I
don't really ever wear lip glosses but I
think it actually looks really pretty
it's not too sticky as well but that's
another thing I don't really like about
lip glosses but this is really nice if
it was really moisturizing and
nourishing on the lips so I already got
anything better to say about it so that
is all for this video I have to say as a
result of trying out all of these
products I honestly feel like the face
products were the best by far I mean any
eyeshadow is work okay they weren't my
favorite but I have to say these
products right here were so good and I'm
actually sure how good they are I
absolutely loved the bronzer I feel like
I will actually get a lot of use out of
this for like everyday let me know below

I showed you today and if you have tried
any of them before I will have all the
links to each of the products that I
