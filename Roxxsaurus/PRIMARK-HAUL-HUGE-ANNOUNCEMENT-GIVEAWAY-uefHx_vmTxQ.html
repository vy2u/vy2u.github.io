channel I hope you guys are all well so
today I have an exciting video I am
doing a practical I haven't done one of
these in so long it feels like I haven't
done one in so long but I don't you went
to Primark and I picked up so much stuff
and they have some amazing clothes in at
the moment so I thought I would share
them with you guys but before we jump
straight in I have a quick announcement
to make
it's quite an exciting what actually
some of you may have noticed that I've
been wearing these amazing lotus flower
earrings recently these are from Daisy
jewelry and I am so excited to announce
that I'm actually going to be
collaborating with Daisy jewelry on my
own set of earrings and just for you
guys that you guys can actually buy all
my not never actually have like a
product that you guys could buy from me
to you so this is super super amazing
and I'm so excited so since I've been
wearing these earrings I've actually
been a little bit more adventurous with
my earring game recently so I've been
wanting to like mix and match my
earrings a little bit and wear like
different designs at the same time but
it's quite difficult I wear most brands
don't sell as of earrings that don't
match if you know I mean so I'm super
excited that Daisy has offered to
actually do like her 4 different designs
in one box so you get two sets of
earrings that I shoot all different
designs so you can mix and match your
arrows depending on how you feel that
day
so as great as it sounds it gets even
better so you guys have been like along
with me on every step of the way with my
youtube channel and whatnot so I thought
how amazing would it be if you guys can
actually help me design this product you
can all go through the process with me
and we can all have an input into the
final product so from the actual jewelry
that designed the colors and even the
box I think it would be amazing if you
guys could help me out with it so this
is the part where you guys get involved
and basically I've started using this
app called yah ball and it runs a bubble
it's basically like a mixture of
snapchat whatsapp and Instagram but it's
got so many cool features which is why
it's like the best platform to basically
do this on so you guys really have an
input into everything and I'm going to
be doing like polls and questionnaires
so you guys can really give me your
opinions on
everything that goes in throughout the
journey of this product to actually get
involved in this I really want you guys
to go ahead right now and download the
Apple and follow me rocks auras as well
as Daisy underscore jewelry so you can
basically follow the whole process
through and of course as a thank you to
you guys for doing this I'm going to be
hosting a YouTube starter pack giveaway
so that you guys can actually start your
in channel if you're interested or if
you've never had the chance and you
would really like to start your own

pound makeup voucher so you guys can

going to be needing so much help from

collab with a brand so I'm going to need
you guys to help me choose four of your
favorite studs I've got a whole bunch of
studs here that I'm gonna choose my
favorites from and you guys get the last

going to go in the final product so I

enter the second giveaway so yeah that
was all I am really really excited and I
hope you guys are excited too but
without further ado let's just jump
right into this Primark haul I am ready
ok so the first thing I picked up is
this really really gorgeous kind of like
ribbed jumper not jumper like a top like
a long sleeve top it's got like this
really nice cutout at the front I don't
know if you'll be able to see very
clearly and it's called like a nice
turtleneck and it's just such a nice
material this was only 8 pounds I think
this is such a
staple piece and it just said she goes
of anything like glittery France and
jeans and you are good to go it's so so
cute you guys know I love my toe next I
had to get this one and this is like a
ribbed gray turtleneck I wore this
already I think in one of my pictures
and I think one of you guys already
asked where's this prom so yeah this is
from Primark this was I think this was
eight pounds as well I'm not too sure
because I took off the label but it's so
nice and as it's getting colder I just
thought I had to like pick up something
that's a little bit warmer and this is
like so comfortable you guys don't even
know and here we have another title no
this is basically the same one as the
Black Panther I just showed you but in
grey so it's kind of like a little bit
of a different vibe I think you can
actually see the design better when it's
grey so this is what it looks like super
super cute I then picked up this really
cute Navy vest top it's got a little
pocket on this side as you can see this
was only three pounds and it's just such
a nice like like a basic you need like
Basics in your life that sounds so basic
you need like basic clothing you know if
you know how sometimes you want to wear
like just something really plain to like
spice up with a necklace I never have
those types of tops so I thought I need
to like invest in one and it wasn't
really a big investment because it's
only three pounds so it was so worth it
I am so excited for all term you guys
have no idea I like awesome I think is
my favorite season of all because I just
love like wrapping up in cozy blankets
and jumpers and like the atmosphere of
Halloween and one of the main things is
of course cozy jumpers so I had to pick
up this one it's like a cable knit
jumper it's worth 10 pounds so super
good for something like this and like
Topshop or like river island you'd
probably pay like 25 pounds so 10 quid
is really good and it's like a really
nice just key pink color which is like
really in at the moment the next thing I
picked up is this gorgeous jumpsuit it
looks like a dress I saw this on the
hanger and I was like oh my gosh this is
so beautiful and again it's like that
nudie color it's got like kind of like a
sparkle going through it and I actually
got this because actually when you're
watching this I'm going to be in New
York so yeah and that's basically what I
go to if I got
for New York because I'm going with
Maybelline and I'm super super excited
and yeah I just thought this would be
like a really nice piece to wear for
dinner and it's meant to be quite warm
out there so that's why I got this don't
think I'm crazy for buying like a
summery jumpsuit when it's like autumn I
then got some jeans these were 13 pounds
don't mind how crinkly they are don't
mind how crinkly they are and also I got
like foundational limp I don't even know
how this happened but they're like
really nice kind of like acid-wash jeans
I always wear black jeans and I'm
getting so bored of it so I thought
right I need to get some light denim
jeans so I picked these up and they're
like really high-waisted which I really
like and they're quite stretchy as well
which is good if I eat too much
that's all good next piece that I picked
up is this gorgeous off the shoulder top
and I absolutely love this is so like
flowing and really summery I know
summer's gone now but I thought I have
to get this and this was only 7 pounds
and again you can see like a recurring
theme of like these really cool nudie
colors so you guys know I love my light
colors and pinks and nudes but of course
for autumn I think it's only right that
I get some darker colors in as well so I
got this like dark bottle green color
top it's like it's just like a your
basic kind of v-neck slouchy top and
this was 4 pounds so that's super gray
and it's just like really basic so you
can dress it up dress it down the next
top that I got is this one and I know
you guys have seen this in my last video
as well as some pictures on snapchat or
Instagram whatever and you guys have
really really been liking this and I had
so many questions wences from this is
from Primark yay and I think this was
like eight pounds so not expensive at
all and it's really nice because it's
like a turtleneck but then it like has
like a little bit of a cutout it's not
too much so it doesn't like show you
cleavage or anything just shows like a
nice bit of chest
the last item of clothing that I picked
up is this top and it's like a crushed
velvety it's super out there it's not
something I would usually go for but I
really like the color and it's just
I like noise to the touch and this was
six pounds so I thought it's like a nice
casual top that again you can just tuck
into some jeans and you'll look really
cool
the next thing I picked up on these
gorgeous shoes these were 15 pounds I
literally fell in love with them I had
to have them they are just so pretty
just look at them and they're like the
perfect height because I actually am NOT
like group of heels I don't know if you
guys know and these are like the perfect
height they're not too tall that's why I
picked these up I just wanted like a
nice but simple pair of shoes that I can
just wear like everyday doing at the
autumn time so that is why I've got
these and these for only 15 pounds so
you can't go wrong with 15 pounds so
that is all for my promo cool there is
sadly nothing left in this bag and I
hope you guys enjoyed this little haul
