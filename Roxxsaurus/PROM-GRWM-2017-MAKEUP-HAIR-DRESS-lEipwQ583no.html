I hope you guys are having an awesome
day so far
so today oh my gosh I'm so excited for
this video because I'm doing a prom get
ready with me I've got two giant
balloons right here and I'm just ready
for prom
so in today's video I'm going to be
showing you guys how to achieve this
makeup for prom I'm going to show you
guys how to do my hair and also where I
got this gorgeous address from I'm so
excited for this video because I haven't
done a like a get ready with me chatty
kind of video in so long and just
perfect perfect opportunity if you guys
haven't subscribed yet make sure you do
so you can keep up with two videos a
week from me and we can just hang out
every day on my vlog channel if you
would like to of course my altar is
called a Rob Sora's vlog so make sure
you guys are subscribe I'll leave it in
the little eye as well as the
description if you don't want to see how
to achieve this look for prom then let's
get to it
so first has to throw my face I'm going
to be using my wire sell it Touche claw
blur primer this is like my favorite
primer ever I love she used of pretty
much every single day it's so good at
keeping your makeup routine nice and
smooth throughout the day and just you
know keeping it on your face in general
so this will be perfect to use for prom
so I'm just literally applying this all
over my face to prime it for that our
makeup stays on our skin all day long
now our skin is nicely pret I'm going to
move on to foundation and now the
foundation I'm going to use today is the
YSL Touche Clark because I feel like it
just works super well with the primer so
I'm just going to apply this to my hand
first and then pick it up with my
Primark brush I don't know what this
brush is code but it's really good at
like blending out your foundation it
just really well in general gives you a
really nice coverage and just in general
and even skin tone next I'm going to
take my Tarte concealer this is the
shape tape concealer and I have actually
only just jumped on the bandwagon of
this product I have heard that this
product is amazing and after trying out
I can definitely agree this product is
so good at covering dark circles and let
me tell you my dark circles are like the
darkest of them all so this is
definitely a product that will work for
a lot of you guys out there the fact
that this concealer is a few shades
lighter than my actual skin tone it just
means that it will really nicely
highlight my under eye area
it look really beautiful for photo so
that is why I thought I would use it
this concealer also lasts on my face for
a long time so I could be like sweating
I can be dancing at prom and this
concealer will not be going anywhere now
that my face is finished I'm going to
set everything in place with my mac fix
powder this in a really good powder
concealer just to make sure that all
your oils are under control throughout
the whole night I would also highly
advise that you guys do not actually put
on any translucent powder that's like
loose because it just creates a lot of
flash back in photos especially if
you're using flash photography
so for prom I would highly recommend to
use a powder that's just a natural skin
tone shade rather than a loose powder
okay I'm now going to move on to your
contour so for this I'm going to be
using this Maybelline New York master
contour stick this is a really nice
product because it gives you like a
really nice contoured effect I finished
cream also makes it appear like it's
part of your skin it kind of really
nicely blends into the skin giving you
that natural contoured look that isn't
overdone so you're not going to end up
looking like a clown with this product
it's just super wearable so I'm just
applying this into the contours of my
cheeks or like
yes I'm also going to pull it up into
the temples just to add a little bit of
warmth there and I'm also just going to
apply it the tiniest bit onto the very
tip of my nose and then going to use the
same brush from primark that I used to
blend my foundation this is just going
to give a really smooth and seamless
blend and you can see you can't even
tell that I'm wearing any contour
products it just looks like it's a part
of my skin this is also going to look
really beautiful in photos because it's
just going to give you that really
natural chiseled effect to your face now
because the products that I've just used
is a cream you might run into the
trouble of basically it kind of sliding
down your face throughout the night
which you definitely do not want so you
have to make sure that you also set it
with another product so I'm going to be
using the Tarte bronzer this is the
Amazonian clay waterproof bronzer so
this is definitely not going to be
fighting off of your face at all because
it is waterproof so I'm just basically
going to go over with the powder over
the contour that we've just applied with
the cream just so that it stays on all
night long and does not budge off of
your face I'm also going to use the same
bronzer and just run this down my neck
and kind of intensify my jaw line this
is really going to help out in
photography especially when it's flashed
it's just going to give you that little
bit more definition to your neck area
you can also run this down onto your
collar bones if your dress is kind of
showing off your collar bones a little
bit it's always nice to use your bronzer
on your kind of chest and neck area so
that all of your makeup blends in nicely
and is not a different color now moving
on the blush I'm going to be using the
 London blush in shade vain so
this is one my favorite it's just such
an easy wearable everyday kind of blush
it's like the perfect color you do not
want anything like super pink and super
crazy because you don't want to end up
looking like a clown in your pictures so
you only needed the tiniest bit of blush
just to add a little bit of color back
into the face
as you can see has given me a very
subtle pop of color to my cheeks without
anything crazy so now I'm going to move
on to you on my highlight and highlight
like my favorite episode so I'm going to
be using the a nostalgic glow kit now
this is like super powerfully pigmented
so you only need like the tiniest touch
of this highlighter so I'm going to take
this on a little brush like this one
thick enough to shape summer and I'm
just going to apply this to the very top
of my cheekbone very very light handedly
as you can see that is like already so
blinding so I'm going to stop there
because you do not want to be like
blinding everyone in photos that I've
taken with flash and then we take the
same highlighter on a slightly smaller
brush and just apply the tiniest touch
onto my nose or like slow it's now time
to move on to the brows I was so excited
for this because I'm going to be using
my NYX brow pencil this is the eye brow
this is the eye brow brush part or this
is the eye brow powder pencil in shade
blonde so first up I'm going to just
take the spoolie side and just brush out
my eyebrows to get them nice and tamed
I'm just going to be filling in any
sparse areas to a define them give them
nice shape be very soft and light handed
with this because you do not want to be
going over the top of your browser and
prom and then also going to mimic a few
heads at the very front of my eyebrow so
I'm just literally drawing on some fake
heads right there
just to make the eyebrow a little bit
more faded towards the center part now
that my eyebrows are nicely defined and
finished I'm going to move on to the
eyes and for this I'm going to use my
NYX warm neutral palette this is one of
my favorite palettes just because you
literally have everything you ever need
in this one palette like you have your
shimmers you have your match your
bronzes and it's like your kind of
warmth or shadows and it's just perfect
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm just going to take this sheet here
which is like a really nice brownie
transition kind of shadow this is going
to give it a really nice transition
color for all the other eyeshadows I'm
going to apply it later on so what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to
take this shadow and almost extend it
past my eyebrow to create kind of like a
sea line effect
I'm going to take a slightly darker
shadow so I'm going to go for this one
here I'm taking that on the favorite
brush and just applying this in the very
outer V of my eye this is going to give
the eye looks a little bit more
definition and it's just going to deepen
up the eye and the crease again you want
to slightly taper this out into your
temple as you can see it's just really
lifted the eye area towards the top and
it's going to look beautiful in photos
when we clean it up later next I'm going
to take a slightly more maroon of shadow
which is this one here very red time and
we're only going to use a tiny tiny bit
of this to add that little bit of color
into the crease I think this is going to
look really beautiful with this new
dress that I'm wearing because it's
going to give it a little bit of a pop
of color I'm going to return it back to
the dark brown shadow and I'm going to
apply this underneath my lower lash line
and just apply the whole smokiness
together and letting the lower I show a
lot lower than I usually work but I
think it's really going to emphasize the
eyes and create a lot of attention
around the eyes which i think is perfect
for prom next I'm actually going to
switch this palette you and this one
here which is actually a Primark palette
I absolutely love this one shade of this
palette it's just so it's so pigmented
and it's this one here
so I'm just going to take the gold
eyeshadow on a flat packing brush and
I'm just going to apply this into the
very center of my lid like so this
eyeshadow is not playing around you guys
it's so freakin pigmented so this is the
eyeshadow finished and we can now move
on to the eyeliner so for today's liner
I'm going to be using and this one here
which is by Tarte and this is called the
man-eater eyeliner so what I'm doing
here is I'm just creating a quite a
thick and Graphix wing you can of course
do a slightly thinner one to your
preference and I think that quite a
thick one is going to really complement
this look and make your eyes really
stand out now my eyeliner is nicely
matching I think it's matching I really
hope it is I'm going to move onto at my
mascara so for this I'm going to be
using at this really nice and thick and
Stara from Stila it's called the huge
extreme lash mascara this is very good I
really like
it makes my lashes super like sick and
volumize which is exactly what you want
for prom so I'm just going to apply a
few coats of this onto my top lashes and
for my bottom lashes I'm going to be
using a different mascara this one is
the makeup forever excessive lash
mascara the reason I'm using at two
different mascara is because the ones of
this one here is much more suited to the
bottom lashes just because it's so tiny
and small and you can really get in
there but none of the eyes are finished
we can move on to the lip I'm so excited
about this because the lip is like my
favorite part of makeup so today we're
going to be going for a nude lip so
first step is to align your lip I'm
going to using at this cappuccino and
lip liner from Rimmel London this is
like literally my everyday lip liner
it's like the perfect shade I absolutely
love it and guys know that I love this
look I'm sure it is like an my don't
have like beard it down it's the lines
I'm going to move on to lipstick so
today I'm going to be using adding NYX
lip lingerie in shade push-up this is a
really nice durable shade is going to
really finish off this look and it's
really going to last on your lips all
night long so you'll barely need to even
touch it up and this is the finished
makeup look I absolutely love this look
so much you can also add lashes if you
like I'm not really much of a lash
wearer and I'm sure a lot of you guys
out there on either the perhaps if you
don't wear lashes very often a promise
shouldn't really be the day that you try
to because I know how uncomfortable
lashes are like on the first time you
ever wear them so yeah maybe lay off the
lashes if you're not used to them at
just a tip because you definitely don't
want it to like be sticking off of your
eye and like poking you in the eye and
just you know looking like you're crying
in fun times but I think it's lip it's
absolutely perfect for prom like it's
just so neutral it really enhances all
of the features and your eyes and your
lips and yeah I just think it's perfect
but now I'm going to move on to the hair
now I actually really like how my hair
looks
down I feel like it just really matches
the dress and the color I just think it
looks really great so all I've done is
this she cold my ends with a hair color
so I did that like last night but I'm
not just going to kind of brush this out
and make it a little bit more looser so
because they're just going to be more
like to wave throughout them curl so to
finish off the hair I'm just going to
use and they'll be a dry shampoo this is
the collab a dry shampoo and I'm just
going to spray this into the roots and
just you know just work it in just to
get a little bit of body in there and
that is the most time that the hair is
really nice and bouncy Rayleigh wish I
was going to prom right now because I
like a hundred percent furthest to what
I looked like at my actual prom which
was a disaster I mean just know just
know so now that my hair and makeup is
finished we can move on to the dress
which is like the most important part of
prom I had so much fun shopping up for
this dress I'm about to show you like
it's the one I'm wearing right now it's
just so beautiful it's so unique and if
you guys buy this dress I think you
would 100% stand out from everybody else
I got this dress from a pretty little
thing and it only cost me 50 pounds
would you believe that prom dresses are
like so expensive like I remember when I
bought my prom dress it was probably
like a hundred pounds which is insane so
this was like a bargain and it's just
very like Instagram is still very like
glamorous and I feel like it's perfect a
problem so that is the end of my prom it
get ready with me I just so wish that I
was going to prom right now because look
at me like I'm all ready for prom
where's my prom I swear like YouTube
prom should be a thing and we should
just all have a prom in the YouTube
space that would be insane I really hope

future like getting ready for different
