channel I hope you guys all well let's
talk about periods feel my periods is
something that is not talked about as
often as it should be and all of our
scales go through if you are an owner of
a uterus then you are most likely going
to bleed in your life so I thought why
not make a hack video about how to get
through a period and just simple hacks
that might help you out when you are
going through your period because
periods stuck let's be honest also just
to let you guys know I'm having a
back-to-school giveaway where I'm giving
away a MacBook Pro so all of the
information will be down in the
description all the rules and the
finishing day of the giveaway and all
that kind of stuff so definitely check
the description box so the main rule is
that you have to be subscribed to this
channel rocks or earth as well as my
blog channel rocks or as logs and then
you are automatically entered but
without family let's get to it
so hack number one is for those of us
who don't like everyone around us
knowing that we are on our period and
sometimes when you are in a public
toilet it feels like everyone is
listening to you're opening up your
sanitary towel or a period pad so if you
are one of those people who are a little
bit self-conscious about that then you
can always just open your sanitary towel
before you actually are going to use it
in a public place
all you have to do is just pull off the
noisy part of the wrapper and then wrap
it back up and then when you are in a
public place when you actually unwrap it
to use it it doesn't actually make any
sound which makes it much more discreet
and no one will even know if you are at
school or at work and you have no way of
like smuggling a period pad in with you
especially if you are in a lesson you
can always double pad it so basically
what you want to do is just apply your
first pad as you normally would and then
the second layer of the pad on top of
that one so then once you have used it
the first pad you just take it off bin
it and you have that fresh clean pad
underneath that you can use and you
don't need to worry about smuggling and
pads or just carrying any with you
because you are good to go
if you're one of those girls who gets
really bad cramps during your period
then what you should try and do is lay
on your left side and start rubbing your
belly in a clockwise motion now I don't
know why this actually works but it does
I actually do this all
time when I'm on my period and it just
relieves all the cramps in the pain so
try it in my work for you an attack is
quite a self-explanatory one but I
thought it would include this in this
video anyway because some of you might
have not realized that this is probably
what you should be doing and that is
basically to take your ibuprofen or
whatever painkiller you may be using
right before your cramps actually get
really bad so as soon as you feel your
cramps starting take your ipratropium
straight away and that way you don't
have to wait for the fifteen to thirty
minutes kind of time for the painkiller
starts to kick in and it's much easier
to prevent pain Rob then get rid of it
so you don't have to wait up 15 to 30
minutes for the pain goes to actually
kick in next tag is to use an app - you
track your periods now this is not
sponsored at all by any app in
particular I just think that those
things are great to track down your
period
most of them are free on the app store
the one I've used in the past is clue
and I really really like that one so
yeah check them out and see if they work
for you because it's always good to be
prepared and I'm not one of those people
that has good memory so I never remember
when I'm actually due for my period now
if you have an actually attractive
period like you should be and you
surprisingly come on your period and you
have like nothing no supplies to save
you then you can actually make a DIY pad
the first instinct is to of course make
one out of toilet paper but a lot of you
might be doing it wrong so what you
should be doing is wrapping toilet paper
around your hand maybe five to six times
to get a really really thick layer of
toilet paper and place that in your
underwear and then also go sideways
around you're kind of the bottom of your
underwear to actually secure and lock
that in place so it doesn't move around
now of course this isn't the best
substitute for a natural pad because it
will soak through eventually so as soon
as you have hold up a pad make sure you
use that this is just like the worst
case scenario if you have like no other
solution when a tag is to always bring a
spare pair of underwear or even trousers
if you can my bag or backpack always
have like a little pocket inside that's
quite hidden and secure so if you are
worried about like someone finding it
just base
pop it in like a really secret kind of
pocket and you are good to go if you
ever find yourself in a tight spot then
that is always there to help you out my
next tag is using heated pads to relieve
your pain I actually never knew about
heated pads growing up I didn't really
think to use them I've always been told
to you is like a water bottle but
heating pads are so much better because
you can still move around don't have to
lay in bed and these are especially
great if you're at work or school and
you're in pain and you're cramping so
yeah just get some heater pads
stick them on your back and you're good
to go my next thing is making sure that
you eat foods and drinks that are not
further bloating you so for example
you're not really supposed to drink
caffeine I know I like my Pepsi and Coke
but I try to lay off during my period
because it makes me much more bloated
make sure you kind of lay off the foods
that you know tend to bloat you and make
sure you drink lots of water because you
are definitely wanting to be hydrated
during your period and it's definitely
going to relieve all the pain that you
might be experiencing and my last hug is
to always have like a little survival
kit in your bag or in your backpack
because you never know when you might
get on your period and like the worst
thing that when you are also on your
period is to always have like dry lips
like a chipped nail just everything
happening all going wrong at once so
make sure you're always prepared for all
the different things that could go wrong
during your day especially when you're
in your period because there's just some
things that really really make me mad
like if I took my nail and I'm on my
period I'm like so so annoyed so like my
survival kit would include like a lip
balm because I hate having chapped lips
and nail file like a body lotion and
then of course like sanitary pads and
tampons and things like that so that is
all for my period hacks I hope you guys
