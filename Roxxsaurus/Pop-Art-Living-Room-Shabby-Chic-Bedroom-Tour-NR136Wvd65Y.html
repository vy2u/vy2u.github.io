you a room tour and a living room tour
this was a request by some of you so I
thought I would just film it I have
already uploaded a room tour some time
ago but a lot of things have changed in
my room so this has been updated one and
also going to be showing you and I'm
also going to be showing you my pop art
style room because so you requested it
in my car boot sale horse so I just
thought I'd film it and I'm not gonna
blog too much so let's get started so
this is the entrance to my living room
this is kind of the overview of the
whole living room I apologize for the
really bad lighting but I'm just gonna
start from the left and go around the
whole place and tell you where
everything's from if you're interested
so on the back wall we've got a really
cool wall art paper wallpaper sorry and
that's from ebay the sofa is from cargo
I believe and it's just a simple white
leather sofa and then on the sofa we've
got to learn 100 pillows I think you'll
see quite a theme going wrong going
around in this living room because my
mom really likes pop art and just
everything 60s so this whole living room
is kind of kind of sixties inspired the
pillows are from ebay on the left here
I've got a really vintage e lamp and
that is from our boss I think then
behind that you can probably see that
little picture that I showed in my car
boot sale haul of Twiggy on the right
this is the door to my garden my garden
is over there the curtains are from Ikea
I think the lampshades are from Ikea
also next to the sofa we've got a little
table
like a coffee table and on top see your
little candles are from cargo I think
the table itself is from Congo - on the
left of that I don't know if you can
even see that because the Lighting's a
bit dodgy we've got a little
Chesterfield red vintage chair that
we've got from this vintage store in
London and on top of that I've got the
Elvis Presley pillowcase that I also
showed in my carb itself all and then
this is the main kind of wall of the
living room this is where we have our TV
and we've just got a few shelves around
there and we keep little ornaments bare
so I'll just go from the top left and
you tell you everything's bright so at
the top here you can probably see two
photos of melon Munroe we actually make
them ourselves we just got some frames
and ripped out pictures from a melon
Munroe book and we just put them up
there it looks cool
the little kind of candle holder on the
side that's from the range the fake
plant is from Ikea on the right here
I've got a little jar on the left
it's a English teacher and it says keep
calm and carry on we got that from TK
Maxx and there was tea inside Airport it
looks pretty cool too kind of what keeps
up in so we just pop that bad and then
on the right of that I've got a little
ornament silver camera we got that from
a vintage store in London as well as the
little vintage car and then on the right
of that we've got some books and more
jars a picture of my granddad and a
little vintage bar that he gave my mum
when she was a little along the bottom
I've got that vintage ornament of a
telephone that used to be in my room and
on the left here we've got some pop art
pictures the first one is actually a
printout and we just got the frame from
the range and this one I actually
painted myself which I was pretty proud
of and it's in the style of under Warhol
and I just love it I don't even know how
I managed to make it look so similar to
his outworked
and on the right hair we've got a
massive picture of Audrey Hepburn in
black and white and then we've got some
chest of drawers here from cargo and I'm
on the top I'm not going to zoom in too
much because there's some really
embarrassing photos of me on there
you can probably see and then if you go
in and that's my room man so let's go so
on the right here first of all this is
likely under the stairs bear and this is
my little office so I do my homework
it's a little bit messy but yeah and
just got some little cute photos and
posters just to kind of inspire me I
suppose
just a few of my favorite things like
enemy and stuff like that as you go in
this is my room and this is where you
usually see me film this room is
actually made out of a garage which I
really love because I can play music
really loud and no one will be able to
hear me so I'm just going to start from
the left actually from the door
as you can see I've got some really cute
like vintage shabby chic banner around
my door that's from the range I've got
some lavender flowers they're not real
but I just really like how they look so
I just hang them up on there and then at
meeting on I've got a hand-painted
guitar it was just one of my old guitar
but I didn't really use so I painted it
white to go to my room and then I
painted some daisies on top so that's
what it looks like along the right I've
got this little Q Ottoman of this little
boy I don't know I just really like it
looks kind of creepy but I'm I like
creepy oh I forgot to mention my
wallpaper is from the range on the right
of that that's my little vanity area
where you this is genuinely the area
where you see me film most of the times
and this is my vanity desk pretty sure
you've seen this before if you would
like to see a updated kind of vanity
area tour or storage or makeup
collection and let me know down below
because I can definitely do that
my vanity area chair is just a really
cool vintage blue chair I'm not sure
where I got this from I've had it for
such a long time but I really like you
and I think it really goes well with my
room on the right of that I've got the
chairs actually
with my vanity desk but because I don't
use it I just have it as a little side
table to keep my makeup and some
sunglasses on I really need to think of
a way to store my sunglasses but for now
I've just put them on along man then
I've got my little kind of makeup area
where I keep for my lipsticks and stuff
like that and I got that from the range
tooth may be on this is my bed
so this bed was actually from Ikea and
it was actually black but because my
room is all white and vintage II and
Victorian II I wanted to paint it so I
spray-painted the whole thing white well
my dad did it for me but you know and I
just really really like I think it looks
so much better than my bed set is super
cute it's just blue with little white
polka dots and I'm not too sure I got
this from but if I find out then I'll
let you know in the description and then
on the right I've just got a cute little
teddy bear that I got from my granddad
from Poland and the little pillows I
think this one is from the range that
one is from the range too actually and
then the blanket I think that might be
from Danone I'm not too sure this is
probably my most favorite part of the
room and it's where I've got all of my
vintage and antique photos this was a
collective wall so it took me quite some
time to complete it but I've done it and
I absolutely love it it's got I don't
know it's just the most favorite part of
my room I think it looks a bit dodgy in
the camera but I promise you they're all
aligned and they're not hang in one key
or anything and yeah these photos are
all just collective from karbix sales to
thrift stores and even vintage stores so
I really love them and some of these
photos I actually got from Camden like
this one here that's a natural vintage
Victorian photo that I framed myself and
I think that's my favorite photo of all
time along the right that's my little
bedside table where I keep my bedside
things so I'm not really sure it's
supposed to keep in a bedside table the
little lampshade I absolutely love it
he's inspired it just makes me think of
like back in the day even though I
wasn't alive done but I really loved it
and I got that from a car boot sale I've
got that frame from I think a thrift
store actually and then I've got some
candles that I got from the range and a
little kind of incense burner here that
I've got from Camden and in the middle
I've got a little set of brush and a
mirror and I absolutely love it so cute
and very vintagey and Victorian inspired
so I just put that on there I've it's
very bedside table is actually from
Laura actually I think I've said this in
my last room tour but I still haven't
found out where it's from you know so
don't quote me on now I'm not too sure
where it's actually from but I just
think it's from Laura Ashley
and then moving on this is the set to
that so I think that might be from Laura
actually too and it's just this really
cool kind of I guess I could call it a
cabinet of oddities because I've got a
lot of odd things in there a lot of
collectibles and just really old things
so I'll start from the top
so you open it up and there it is
there's a lot of little miss and match
things so I apologize for that
okay most of the things in here are just
from random places and there isn't like
a particular place I can say that I got
them from because they're all vintage
and antiques and they've just been in my
family for such a long time so I'm just
gonna go through them and just show you
what I have but I won't say word her
from okay this little thing here someone
told me that it was a thing to kind of
put out your cigarettes and I didn't
know that but I got this from a car boot
sale I think yeah carb it's out and I
just use it to kind of store my jewelry
on there and then the shop below that
I've got a kind of vintage music sheet
book thing yeah and then a book about
ancient Egypt I used to be obsessed with
Egypt so that's why it's there and then
on the left I've got a little ornament
of a girl I really really like it it's
very kind of sixties inspired and then
in the middle I've got a the Saatchi
teapot I really don't know how I have
Hisashi teapot like honestly I don't
know where this came from why I have it
but it's actually a Versace teapot like
how cool is that right of I've just got
my Pandora bracelet and some really
weird glasses these are so crazy I've
got a little four-leaf clover just fer
luck and some old matches I'm not too
sure why they're there but below that
I've got I think this is actually my
favorite level of this cabinet because
it's got my vintage cameras bad none of
those work actually but I just really
like the look of them and they look cool
and then I've got some binoculars and a
very old phone and then here I've got a
syringe don't ask why but I just really
like it it looks very old and just
creepy
but I like it and then in this these are
actually like really old needles don't
know if you can see but I've really old
needles they're like they're very thick
and I'm not sure why I have those either
but you know as you can probably tell
from this video and my homeroom um very
weird I always collect a lot of weird
things random one pounds note and then
in the back I've just got three of my
favourite books
Heidi and then the moth Diaries and then
wreck this journal' I actually need to
do more in this but I just keep
forgetting and on the very bottom got a
cute little teapot and then a two little
vintage boxes where I just keep some
jewelry and stuff like that moving on it
I've got a little table here and on top
of this table I've got this candle
holder that I got from the range and I
just absolutely love that I was looking
for a candle holder like this for so
long and then I found it and it's just
perfect and then on the left the left
here I've got a little book thing and
it's a William Shakespeare book but it's
actually a box so you can keep just like
random things in there and this is from
TK Maxx and then underneath that I've
got a little cute shabby-chic box and
this is where I keep my jewelry on my
window so I've got more pictures so this
is just like an antique vintage photo
one of my granddad and here I've got a
little tiny birdcage and that's from the
Danone and then on the right side got
another photo frame and that is from the
Raiders in my front door hi
so by my door I've got this little sofa
where I just chill with my laptop
sometimes and it's very very comfortable
with the pillows on there up from TK
Maxx both of them and then over the top
I've got a little shelf where I keep
some odd book and then on the shelf
below that I've got a clock that's from
the range and then an owl as well and I
think this is from home base got a
really cool big frame from the range and
inside I just put the wax of the stuff
klimt because he is my favorite artist
of all time and then on the right of
that I've got this mannequin and this is
from Ikea so I hope you enjoyed this
