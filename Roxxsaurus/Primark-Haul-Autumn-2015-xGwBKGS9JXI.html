Primark haul and I'm so excited because
this is actually the first time at court
I have ever filmed and I'm really
excited to share with you guys what I
bought here I've got my massive bag from
Primark and I'm just gonna jump straight
in and show you what I got
so the first thing I picked up is a pair
of jeans and these are just these simple
super-high skinny waisted jeans and I
got these in size 10 I really needed to
pick up some denim colored jeans because
I realized that I got stuck in this
cycle of wearing my black skinny jeans
from Topshop and it's not healthy and I
pretty much wrecked them by wearing them
like every other day or so and yeah I
just thought I needed to add some color
into my wardrobe ooh these these were
only ten pounds which is pretty good
because they are very similar to the
Topshop one so I feel like you save a
lot of money by getting these although
you do get the quality that you pay for
I've had a pair of these before but in
black and they do get kind of like baggy
around the knees around the crotch area
so yeah just be wary of that these
aren't going to last you like years the
next thing I got is a really really
awesome lure and like wintery and it
really excites I can't wait to wear this
it's basically this little plaid sort of
style cardigan with pockets it's pretty
long and it's just so nice to the touch
like it's such a nice cozy material and
it's gonna be so on to where I went kind
of shoe crazy in Primark I've got two
pairs of shoes this first one it looks
like this and they are so gorgeous like
they're going to be perfect for autumn
and winter these are like I don't really
know what style of shoes this is but
it's like a suede II sort of color and
these are like leathery obviously not
real leather but yeah I really really
like them and they were only how much
were they and there were only 18 pounds
so again pretty good bargain and on the
inside they've got plaid in so I just
together and the next pair of shoes I
got on these and these cost me 16 pounds
and they really remind me of something
that again I would get in Topshop they
are a really nice color very matching
matching with my top at the moment this
top I also got from Primark as well and
they only cost me six pounds or so I
really like the fact that it's got like
a high neckline and it's got like sort
of batwing sleeves a little bit I don't
know but I really like them and I got
these shoes too much of this top which
is kind of sad but I like a bit of color
coordination but yeah back to the shoes
and they've got a really nice like
scalloped sort of edging on here and
they've got little tassels at the front
they are platform heels so my favorite
kind of heels are so easy to walk in and
I actually did get some leggings too
well with this top they are just plain
black but they have like this I don't
know if you guys will be able to see but
it's all like a straight line stitch I
don't know how to explain it but I hope
you guys can see that they kind of look
like tights with that made out of this
really thick material so they're gonna
be very warm and I'm pretty sure you can
just wear these with anything because
they are quite thick so you're not gonna
be able to see anything like your
underwear through these and I think
they're just gonna be like a really nice
piece for winter and they look really
cozy and they do feel very fuzzy on as
well these only cost me eight pounds I
think so not too bad I also picked up
this brush because I like to blow-dry my
hair and sort of curl my hair on it
while Stumbler drying it and I don't
actually have one of these so I got this
and I think this was about two pounds or
so and the last thing I got is this
burgundy coat and it's got a really
really nice faux fur sort of detailing
around the collar sort of area and this
was 25 pounds it looks like this it's
gonna be quite hard to show but it's
quite a long coat it's got some pockets
and my favourite bit is this little
furry collar sort of around the whole
coat this is detachable so you can take
it off and it's just such a gorgeous
color I'm very into my like berries and
reds as you can probably tell from my
lips and my top but yeah I will probably
be including this in
a look book which I'm filming very soon
so stay tuned for that so yeah that's
all for my Primark haul this bag is
empty I hope you guys enjoyed this if
you would like to see any more of these
Primark haul videos then definitely let
me know because I don't mind go lots of
shop like that's fine by me
you guys might be able to tell that my
videos a slightly better quality I did
just get a new lens and this is the
Sigma 30 millimeter 1.4 lens it really
gives like a shallow depth of field but
I don't really know how to work it yet
so bear with me whilst I like learn how
to figure things out also thank you guys
so much for reaching 400,000 subscribers
with me I literally can't thank you guys
enough it means so much to me and I
can't believe we've gotten this far on
my channel yeah just just a big thank
you to everyone I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I will see
you very soon in my next video fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
