different video than I usually film on
this channel and in my last video I
asked you guys to leave some questions
for me because on a daily basis I get a
lot of different questions on my videos
or an Instagram so I thought I'd just
collect all these questions and just put
them in a video of like things that you
guys always ask me so here it is so I've
got some questions here on my phone
which is why I'll be looking down or to
the side and yeah it's just jump right
in
ok so first let's go to Instagram and
Carly Murray asks when you first start
wearing makeup but was it natural and
easy for you or was there someone who
taught you or inspired you in your looks
I love your videos Thank You Carly and
to be honest I was kind of self taught I
YouTube wasn't really around when I
started doing makeup and makeup on
myself and stuff like that so I kind of
was self-taught I mean I did probably
get a little bit of inspiration from my
mum because my mom was good at makeup so
yeah I think I was in the self-taught or
kind of took some tips and tricks from
my mum Bailey dot mainly I think I'm
saying that right asks what are some of
your favorite movies I have quite a lot
of movies that I really like because I'm
like a movie watcher but some of the
movies that have really stuck with me
were the perks of being a wallflower the
art of getting by and Ruby sparks I
really really like those three so you
guys should definitely check them out
X dot Giselle asks what age did you
start wearing makeup I think I was about
14 and I know that's pretty young but it
was only like concealer because I had
quite a bit of problematic skin when I
was growing up so I just used that to
kind of make me feel a little bit more
confident but apart from that I don't
really use makeup hello Geoffrey asks
how do you stay happy I think that just
having the realization of how lucky you
are every day you are healthy you have a
house you have internet you are not
starving you have a family or a friend
or somebody that loves you and all of
that just comes into one and you
sometimes have to just step back from a
situation
and just realize that you are maybe
being a little bit ungrateful and some
of the people out there do not have the
same luxury that you do so I think just
having that realization sometimes really
makes me happy and apart from that my
family and my boyfriend paper trails X
asks what are your favorite singer slash
bands I have quite a few artists I'm
really all over the place of music
because I just like anything pretty much
but some of my favorite artists are
mother manson Florence and the Machine
architects The Smiths Nirvana daughter
Crystal Castles um let's see what else
do I have in here d ant birthday on
whatever you like disclosure and to
Shikari Fleetwood Mac just things like
that so I'm really really all over the
place with my music some underscore
Butthead asks what's your Holy Grail
makeup products and at the moment I have
two and the first one is the Max Factor
2000 calorie mascara I think that this
is a really good mascara and the price
is very affordable as well and the other
item is the Bourjois healthy mix
foundation I have been wearing this a
lot recently and I think that this is
great for like dry skin and it has a
really good coverage so it just makes
your skin look really really flawless
I'm not Kerry I think that's how you say
it asks what's your most worn item of
clothing and if I cannot pop the picture
right here it's this vintage shirt it's
got like a really nice autumn
atmospheric pattern on it and I bought
it at a charity show up like last year
and I have been wearing it a lot a lot a
lot I need to stop wearing it Erin the
alien asks would you rather have to wear
the same thing every day we'll never be
able to wear makeup again that is hard
Erin what are you doing to me I think I
don't have to not wear makeup I mean
makeup is it makes you feel good but
it's not as visible like clothing-wise
wearing the same thing every day can it
be washed or what I have to wear it like
day I'll probably just go with not being
able to
again Tory to write asks what made you
want to start YouTube to be honest there
wasn't really much of a background story
to it
I was just quite bored one day so I
decided to start making videos I was
quite inspired by all the youtubers that
I've watched I remember distinctly that
the person that made me want to start
videos was Marcia from cutiepiemarzia
and I don't know she just I just thought
wow that's so cool I want to make videos
too so I started and somehow I've gotten
this far and I've been making videos for
like over a year now flower Lina asks
what's your favorite famous
artwork I have quite a few but my two
favorite are probably the kiss by Gustav
Klimt or a philia by John Everett
Millais those two are like perfect Sara
X has her son I'm sorry I'm sorry you
guys if I'm like completely butchering
your usernames Sarah asks most
embarrassing story in secondary school I
haven't actually had that many
embarrassing stories in secondary school
but I always remember that every time I
was laughing so so much at break
I had to kneel down or else I'd pee
myself and it was pretty embarrassing
like just imagine walking walking
walking and then you have to like kneel
down on the ground it looks really funny
I bet underscore asks what's your
favorite animal and why my favorite
animal will always be a cat and I love
dogs too don't get me wrong I do have a
dog but cats and just they have a
special place in my heart yeah
definitely a cat and because they are
just fluffy and we are the same in life
we just like to sleep and get stroked
and that sounded weird yeah just cats
because cats a life they are you know it
and I know it Marie says there
underscore 11 asks what's your favorite
grunge band what's your favorite Nirvana
song such album I'm going to be typical
and say that Nirvana is my favorite
grunge band like they are amazing and
I've loved them for so long now and
their favorite my favorite song by them
is probably lithium or you know you're
right
amazing hi blogger asks what do you
personally think is the reason so many
people relate to you that's a nice
compliment so thank you to begin with
I don't know I never thought that I'm
relatable but maybe it's because I have
never uh neglected the people that
watched me and if someone asks me a
question I try my best to answer them
and if someone messages me on Instagram
or any social media I will always reply
to them and the score Lucia Aria asks
who are your favorite youtubers and I
have quite a lot of youtubers that I
watch some that spring to mind is TN
Wonderland
Emma's rectangle Canadian Beauty zoella
PewDiePie Tanya burr pointlessblog
graveyard girl if I think of any more
than I'll put them down below simply
Ajay asks where do you draw most of your
inspiration from for your style art etc
well I draw inspiration from everywhere
I mean some sometimes it's hard because
I get like artist block I like to go on
Tumblr and Pinterest a lot just to kind
of type in random things and just see
what comes up I follow a lot of boards
on Pinterest and it's just a really nice
place to get inspiration for your work
or fashion or just anything in general
because literally everything is on that
Marty Baron gang bargain Mart bargain
which country would you like to visit I
would love to visit Japan out of all the
countries in the world I think Japan is
like the only one that springs to mind
when I think of where I want to go in
the future so Japan like Tokyo I just
love to go there because from a young
age I was really really into the
Japanese culture so I find it really
interesting to go that X root list tree
asks if you could travel back in time to
any era in history what would it be it
either be the Victorian era or 1970s the
victor
era wasn't very kind to women but I just
loved the fashion of it and I think that
the fashion back then was so much better
now if you wore a corset and massive
gowns you'd probably get picked on and
people would think you're weird but but
then it was like the thing so I'd love
to live in that era and 1970s was such a
glamorous era so I just loved her and
the music the jazz I loved it I loved it
Nicole underscore P underscore Clarke
asks if you could have one superpower
what would it be and why my dad's
outside of my room
can you leave I probably have the power
of speed because I just love to get
places quick or I would have the power
to be clairvoyant which is when you just
know things I'd like to know things and
then the original asks what would be
your dream job my dream job would
definitely be anything to do with the
art industry I know it's gonna be really
hard to find a job in there but I'm
gonna try my hardest and hopefully
fingers crossed I can get a job in there
anything to do with art I really like
photography drawing painting editing
filmmaking makeup I just it's really
hard for me to focus on one thing but
maybe a makeup artist would be something
interesting so I could also look into
that Katie Jane Woolf asks where do you
work other than YouTube
I wouldn't call youtuber work it's a
hobby and I really really enjoy it
on the side and I work at TK Maxx I'm a
sales associate and it's it gets me by
but you know I wanna I want to move on
to something that's more to do with what
I want to do lara done see see I don't
know how to pronounce that can you give
me a shout out hi Lara and also if you
had to only buy clothes from one shop
again what shop would it be it'd
definitely be Topshop Topshop is one of
my favorite like high street shops or
river island I like those too
a lot Shan Fletcher asks that what's
your favorite winter drink to order from
Costa oh my god I'm so glad to want ask
this question because I love the winter
drinks in Costa but my favorite one has
to be apple spice tea it's amazing
Sasha Mendoza asks how do you develop
your style always that really confident
and pretty well thank you and I don't
know I just kind of draw inspiration
from random places I like to think that
I don't really have like a particular
style because I like to dress however I
like I don't have a label I wouldn't
want to have a label I just kind of
dress whatever I feel like dressing that
particular day so if one day I want a
dress or cutesy with a knit jumper then
I'll do that and if one day I want a
dress like really gothic then I'll do
that too
and Gibbs in 95 asks who is the most
amazing person in the world hmm let me
think
me I'm joking you definitely you okay so
moving on to the YouTube comments Street
or vintage asks are you currently doing
a-levels if so what subjects and do you
plan on going to university I have
finished a levels I did photography art
and psychology and right now I'm doing a
foundation art course at college still
for one year and I think that this will
just give me a bit of time to decide
what I want to do and if I want to go to
uni and I'm pretty sure I will go to uni
Diana's sim asks do you have any phobias
I have a terrible phobia of spiders and
slugs I'm not too sure why slugs are
just like living there not harming
anyone they move really slow but I just
find them so disgusting and when you can
see the veins inside no Rachael Galindo
asks do you live alone I do not live
alone I live with my parents still yeah
I don't already know why people think I
live alone I don't and also do you miss
your red hair
I do sometimes miss more about hair but
I do enjoy the light hair for a while am
I
returned to read one day but for now I
think I'm going to stick with this color
because it took me so long to get to the
color I wanted to be and this is the
first time I've had a really light hair
since I was a little kid Petro Marivic
asked I read that you are from Poland
what's the background story behind it
and well I have lived in Poland I am
polish I'm 100% polish for some of you
who don't know this both of my parents
are polish I moved here when I was 9 so
I've lived in England for half of my
life now and yeah not much else to it
michaela vasilich asks any tips on
starting a YouTube channel I absolutely
love in videos that love you let me turn
Makayla and thank you I think my tip for
starting a YouTube channel is definitely
to film something that you would want to
watch don't film something that you just
think will get views or whatever I think
that having a specific kind of style
will really benefit you in the long run
because you're being yourself and as
long as you have the knowledge and
genuine passion in what you do then
you'll get far because people will
notice how passionate you are about it
and definitely another tip is to not
give up be dedicated upload regularly
it's not gonna happen overnight you're
not gonna get thousands of subscribers
overnight you have to work for it and it
will come with time Sabrina blur asks
are you on any diet and how do you stay
in such a great shape I actually don't
have a diet and I don't do that much
exercise I should be doing a lot more
but when I do exercise I usually do
scrunches or squats and things like that
and I don't really have anything in
particular although I have been trying
this really cool tea recently and it's
called fit tea and it's a 14 day detox
it looks like this and I think that this
is really good to kind of like flush you
out of all the toxins and just genuinely
improve your health a little bit if
you're not much of a diet person or an
exercise person I think that this is
great if you like tea and I personally
am a tea lover
this is great it says promotes fat
burning and weight loss improve your
immune system soothes and cleans your
digestive system so you know it's all
great things and it can only benefit you
mega ray asks what are your favorite
movies and TV series I've already
answered the movie's part but my
favorite TV shows are American Horror
Story Supernatural Vampire Diaries the
originals pretty little liars again if I
think of them I'll pop them down below
that you guys can check them out
Alex Ratcliffe husks my question is do
you work full-time or go to six form and
how do you manage YouTube as well I do
not work full time and I have college
from Monday to wednesday so it's only
like three days a week and then I work
for like two days a week and then I have
like usually an extra day or I just film
after college or I film before work like
right now and yeah that's pretty much
how I deal with that and that is all for
my Q&amp;amp;A I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I do apologize if I haven't
answered every single question I feel
like I've answered like 100 questions so
I hope this didn't bore you too much but
yeah these are the things that you guys
have been asking so there you go I'm
thinking about filming a Khaleesi
makeup tutorial next video so if you
guys would like to see that give this
video a big thumbs up so I know
and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you in my next one
