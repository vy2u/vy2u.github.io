gonna be taking my white snazaroo or
water-based paint and mixing it with a
true match foundation that is a really
light shade we want the skin to look
very ghostly so I'm gonna apply this
over my face and neck area and then
blend this out with a Beauty Blender
moving on to the eye shadow I'm gonna be
using this Urban Decay Naked Ultima
basics palette and from this I'm gonna
be taking at this dark brown shadow and
just applying this all over the lid I'm
then taking a lighter brown shadow just
to diffuse and blend out the edges of
the dark shadow I'm also gonna take the
same shadow quite low underneath the
eyes just to really give us that deadly
and tired look taking the darkest shadow
of the palette I'm gonna be blending
this into the outer corner and then also
kind of diffusing it into the inner
corner and kind of also blending this
out into the crease as well this is
gonna be like the base shadow and I'm
also gonna apply this underneath my eyes
just to get that ultimate dark smoky
effect I'm then returning back to the
dark brown shadow and just really
blending that black out even more and
then also going to take that dark brown
shadow just to contour my nose and add a
little bit of definition using the
Maybelline brow precise pencil I'm just
gonna fill in my brows and just add any
extra hairs where I may have any sparse
areas of my brows next I'm gonna mix the
dark brown shadow with a tiny bit of the
black and I'm gonna use this as a
contour because you want this to look
quite ghostly doe on the concert would
be too warm toned so adding that bit of
black in there is gonna really make that
contour look more grey next up I'm gonna
be using the rock nudes palette from
Maybelline and I'm taking the silvery
shimmery kind of shadow just to apply it
onto the very center of my lid this is
gonna give it that pop of color in the
midst of the black now moving on to the
main part which is the mouth part I'm
actually using a black liner to just
create these rigid edges and it's kind
of making them look like teeth but maybe
like a ripped mouth I'm actually really
upset because a lot of this wasn't
actually filming but this is the
finished look I'm sure you guys can get
the gist you can be as messy and as
creative with it as you want next up I'm
taking at the black liner from NYX and
I'm just creating these really long
strokes attached to my eye they're kind
of meant to look like lashes like super
super long lashes um the end of the lash
to be the thinnest point you can create
and you want them to go a little bit
thicker towards the eye just to make
them look a little bit more realistic
what my actual lashes I purchased these
feather lashes off of ebay I'll have a
link down below and as she cut them down
to shape so they were a little bit more
spiky so I'm just gonna apply those to
my eyes for the ultimate creepy ila now
moving on to at the neck part I actually
love this it's kind of like a Victorian
garment kind of design I saw this online
and I was like this is amazing so I
decided to recreate it so basically what
you want to do is just draw a thick
black lines kind of creating like a
peter pan collar type shape and then you
really want to just be as creative as
you like you can add some frills you can
add some gems literally anything I
decided to go for a little bit of
netting so I'm just creating some
vertical lines down from my neck onto
the actual collar bones and then I'm
just creating like a crisscross effect
this is super super easy to recreate and
lastly to finish off the leg I'm just
putting on this really long black wig
and a crown which I both got from eBay
so I'll have links down below and this
is the finish to a queen of the Dead
makeup look
I absolutely love how this turned out it
was actually really simple to it create
but I feel like it's really effective
but that is all from me thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
