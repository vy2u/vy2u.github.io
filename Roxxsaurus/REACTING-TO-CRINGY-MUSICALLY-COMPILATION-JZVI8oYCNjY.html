you like to go in if she sounds like a
tractor can you both hear it
yes bye bye mother hello everyone and
welcome back to my channel and have you
guys are having an awesome day so far I
can see from the title today I'm going
to be reacting to a cringy musical ease
now musically is an app that I haven't
really been too familiar with
I literally just made an account if you
guys would like to follow me on that and
my username is just rocks with a 1 on
the end because sadly some ones are
poisoning no I'm super late on the bag
whatever but it's not made for never I'm
alright guys enjoy this video make sure
you smash a few times I've just down
below and also subscribe if you are
brand new because I would love to have
you come and join at the dinosaur family
but whatever ado let's get into the
video ok so the video I'm going to watch
is a musically cringe compilation off of
youtube I have not seen this yet so I'm
really excited to give you guys my first
reaction this video has 2.6 million
views which is a she insane I do I don't
looking down a lot because my left over
here and I'm watching the video oh my
god the camera website get it get it
Oh cute I wish I had like a best friend
to do me oh that transition oh wow
psy is a very flattering angle
Oh God oh my god guys did you see this
that was this Wow skills what do
you mean or anything but I wonder where
these kids parents are be honest I was
just like you bit creepy though okay
when I ask you Layton quickly
oh god this is in slow mode so it's
already going like I can't have them
they're wrong oh how weird oh no oh no
no no no no no he's just with any
serious oh my god no my mother
oh god oh god guys what has been seen
cannot be unseen I was so peachy them
Evanescence oh oh that was a good
transition oh my god
Oh No she's so young oh no she's really
cute but she's way too young to be on
the internet like on musically
especially in her underwear and I Jacob
stop Horace Oh No ah this is probably an
unpopular opinion but I just think that
she has to be sharing things like that
he's really gonna be like camera wet and
stuff but just like the list is a bit
bit cringe oh wow that bends oh I don't
have to do that work it
yeah work it girl oh my gosh really good
beautiful will you still love me when I
got nothing but my aching soul
okay what does alone this carry goes
okay look with that so involved already
with what sounds seven years or you kind
of sell-off it see but you know only one
sound seven years old boo boo boo boo
boo okay
oh no you're like ten come on like I
wonder what would happen if like his mum
Moulton walking with Dana like Lester
Beyonce does were okay oh god is that
mr. Vijay I think is all random guys
across an infamous a
like the camera walk I like that
okay who's God with oh my rap looks
funny oh god oh god oh I'm going this
new invoice from the vacation sartorius
a little bit away anyway real nice oh my
god I'm the bias like cringe - all laugh
it sounds like you they just put a bowl
on him and just like perfectly cut
around it this kid is coming off a lot
I don't see why just creepy though he's
mine good at it you must be quite famous
let me know down below I do this kid is
because I don't know who he is what that
would be extreme version of Carly Rae
Jepsen oh my god
norway's this little tiny kid or
musically and that's all though
oh haha how many summers does this can
happen I can see oh oh my god I like
staring into my soul so a lot of
dwelling into of the world of musically
I have come to the conclusion that there
is just far too many milk kids like 10
or under trying to be like really sexy
and like I don't like tell you what I
think this I don't know maybe it's just
me but I just think that it looks like
some of the things that they're doing is
waiting sexual to be doing on the
Internet I like a 10 year old kids don't
have a really cool day I really want to
get into doing musically more so make
sure you guys follow me on that if you
would like to see more of my face I'm
probably going to be super embarrassing
so even more reason to go talk to me but
imagine if one day I might end up in one
of these cringing compilations it but
that is all over this video I really
hope you guys enjoyed this slightly new
video like me reacting to stuff I don't
usually do things like this on this
channel if you guys enjoyed this video
make sure you smash that thumbs up just
down below and also subscribe if you
haven't already because I'd love to have
you here come and join the dinosaur
family but that is all from me I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day and
I'll see you very soon in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
