are you doing I hope you guys are doing
super well I began stuff from the title
I'm going to be reacting to my first and
those youtube video now this is super
scary I haven't really gone to the very
beginning of my channel in a while and I
haven't watched any of my videos I
started my channel three years ago and I
look completely different I was a
completely different person when I
started to why I am now this is really
weird seeing like the old me so I
figured I would kind of film this for
you guys so you guys can get insight as
to what I was kind of like three years
ago a lot of my videos that I've filmed
and the beginning of my channel and our
private because they're just way too
embarrassing like I cannot keep them
public so I practiced a lot of them are
meaning you guys can see that by the day
you know you're in for a treat I'm going
to show you my first ever video okay so
I got my laptop here and I'm just going
to be going three and back in my channel
timeline and the first video that you
guys will see which is a public video if
actually I have to make your own lip
scrub lush juice in brackets so that's
the thing you see it's got thirty three
thousand views is three years ago and it
doesn't even have my face and it doesn't
have me talking it's just like music
intact and it's such a rubbish video but
if you go to the laughs make sure you go
Morris as well but today I'm actually
going to be showing you guys my August
favorites 2013 first of all this is the
Sun now it looks like I look like I'm
struggling you can't even see what I'm
holding is awesome now and you can see
like a tiny bit of my face and it's just
like what was I thinking and the phone l
was so dark is where I care
that's an email from Edina a gift from
end my father used to be some dark I
don't know how I why I did that like why
would anyone want to click learning
these videos so the other favorite is
actually private but it has got 264
views we're just quite funny because
like I thought that was so many people
watching me at the time I was like oh my
god I'm going viral
but really I wasn't it just no okay so
I'm gonna
video and I'm going to react to the beam
up you guys this is my first time seeing
it in like three years
so a domino like I'm time they say um I
hope he'll see what okay first of all
what was that I was like scanning he's
like my voice is so different a bag I
can't believe this
like I know that's how I look but I
didn't know I sounded like that that is
terrible
oh my god okay and got seasick
okay next thing I've got a few stuff
here I've got a few stuff here
who said that like I was literally like
what I can't speak at this point i'm a
fetus Rock Soros and I can't talk drama
not seeing me is actually dying right
now
sorry the next thing I notice is my
eyebrows can we just talk about my
eyebrows little before the Instagram
brow days
honestly they kind of resemble a firm
not to be rude or anything but yeah
that's what it looks like at least what
eyebrows have improved that's why I can
take away from the video I'm create hair
about it because my favorite um my first
okay wait a second I did it all the
favorite and then I said this is my
favorite oh wait not knows not what is
your favorite like first thing I'm
really excited artist
it's like foundation Mac Studio sculpt
efficacy foundation and this one is in
NP Bobo's empty fibers and okay I'm
soaking it on and the fact I was 17 year
long bless me and the active site is
true that was my first ever foundation I
didn't really use to use foundation I
always use concealer like all in my face
I just preferred it but yes they're
pretty hard thing that I don't need
foundation at work and one before is
just dry circles and run
and I use it for that recap I can't stop
looking at my eyebrow like that's what's
just sticking out to me so much and I
was living it so good like I never
thought that I was like the foundation
because I've ever been at Party tea or
me a melon head no I'm not how I didn't
cut out the awkward bit like that's what
I used to nominate youtubers Kyle
everything we censor ourselves so much
because we go what you guys to think
over awkward like we don't we start our
we don't know what to say my dad was
doing all the time like I always cut out
a bit where I like say something wrong
and I start over again because it's just
like we want you guys to see like the
most clean version of what we do we want
to seem like the most put together and
straight forward so it's like easy to
watch but obviously three years ago that
wasn't the case and I did Carlos bit and
I'm wondering like what it would be like
these days if that's what youtubers
sewed it I think it would be quite cool
like even what Paul isn't so I what I
was thinking I should have just cut this
outside didn't and I'm just like it's my
way to see that because now I cut those
bits up where I'm thinking about what
I'm about to say I always cut that out
because there's no put you guys looking
at me in silence you know I mean hear
anything about how are you going on
about the donation oh my god my chorus
part is kinda China this everyone on is
just just a bit sandwich I left what's
in my bag
hey I thought I was so cute eating that
the end of me sneezing but now you're
not you
it's a sneeze get over yourself the
perfect thing I remember nothing it's
very funny Frank has a lot of these
bitter I messed up and I thought I'm
like cool and I would like so did that
and still wish that like other people
did it to you because it does show a lot
more personality than just like being
perfect all the time right if you
preside over the park it was just
amazing so yes that's so weird
I don't acted so different like it's so
weird looking back I do that's one thing
that's amazing about you cheese like
when you make videos you can look back a
few years ago and see where you were
like what you look like
eventually one day we'll be able to show
your kids and like that's really amazing
that they you can document your life
like this I see this massacre I find it
a lot of are speaking like I'm supposed
to really quitting another behind in
this because I heart as my eyes when I'm
done yeah is the trigger for sweeps look
beautiful wait what do you mean you
don't know like a grieving it's a
feeding mask it covers up it brought out
the light that's what it does that's why
you fall asleep quicker I really might
have talked a lot of one random BS
because I didn't really have that much
to say by then so I just kind of made
random points about things other than
yeah
my husband okay then fun easy but yes
what animal so if you would like an
ending a half star my combo and please
just comment down below and oh yeah
comment down below guys net you want me
to do how to star my converse comment
down below my style change missing that
so much like looking back I need to
dress like so strange I feel like I was
going through like the hip still want to
be staged at this point okay this is
tribal command if you like this video or
like what I'm doing and if you watch it
you're not really certain are you can
visit just like just like or whatever
you want to do really so that was that
that was the first video okay so
somebody was quite short I feel like I
want to show you another video and
embarrass myself even further because
why not
2017 and then I'll show you my second
video which is an autumn lookbook 2013 I
was such a little like wanna be emo
flash God like I don't really know which
one it was at the time I didn't really
understand the meaning of either of them
but I liked the style and I just wanted
to dress like that if you guys are here
from the start you will know that I used
to really like gross stuff like I still
sometimes listen to like grungy music
and stuff so it was not really like one
of those tumblr those that just wore a
shirt of Nirvana and never listened to
them if you know I mean but I yeah like
I don't really dress like that anymore
so I was so all over the place
my little eyes only long jumper fruit
jelly roses oh my god no way
that does not go with everything so okay
let's re-evaluate this I'm wearing a hat
beasted you thought I was one of the
girls and then I'm wearing like her
denim college show with a Ralph Lauren
jumper over and like a khaki coat and
then under chrome jeans and on the
bottom I'm wearing like Ted Baker style
jelly groups what why oh no this is
terrible this one evil worse than the
other two so okay summary I'm wearing a
black Bowl hat a leather jacket and knit
John pass a Gucci bag that was actually
my mom's not mine and then like like
Chino trousers I think I was trying to
buy my daughter clothing with like
classy kind of outfit and it does not
work apples look so bad why oh my god I
actually used to dress like that can you
believe that
oh no I'll know the booth oh my god the
boots are so bad that even worse that
makes the outfit even worse I just know
that it goes together
I was so cringy what the heck oh no no I
can't even I can't even look at that and
there's so many more where that came
from
honestly if I make them public you guys
are not gonna be different people so
that is all for this video I thought I
would just sit down with you guys and
kind of throw a slightly different video
a little bit more personal than my like
other video and
on the field so we're going down memory
lane and looking back at how I used to
act on camera like I think those videos
are definitely like the beginning point
and all you can do from there is grow so
if any of you would like to start a
channel and you're worried about not
being a confident as like these
youtubers have been doing it in years
do not worry we've all started in the
same place we always with that awkward
stage where we didn't know what to say
didn't know how to act on camera and we
just said really cringey and stupid
things like I feel like everyone handled
through that and it's totally okay to do
so let me know down below what you
thought of those videos honestly I just
I'm shook to the court that that was how
I acted because enjoy this video make
sure you hit back you thumbs up just
down below and also subscribe to our
brand new I would love to have you here
but anyway that is all from me I hope
you guys are having the best day ever
and I will see you very soon in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
