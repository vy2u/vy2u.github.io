channel I hope you guys it all well
today I thought I would do the famous
texting lyric prank video on my
boyfriend so firstly you don't know
basically what you do is you text some
lyrics to your friend or your boyfriend
basically you try and see how long you
can get away with pranking them before
they realize that it's song lyrics I
have honestly never done a prank video
I've never even pulled a prank on anyone
before so I'm probably gonna really suck
at this but it's worth a try if might
work out but today I'm gonna be pranking
on my boyfriend with the lyrics from
Ash's song burn now this song has been
released I think in like 2004 correct me
if I'm wrong but I don't think that he
will know this song maybe he will but
it's such an old song that he probably
won't catch on that it's lyrics which is
exactly what we want so hopefully
fingers crossed they works me and Mac
have already spoken all day today so I'm
a little bit scared how he's gonna take
it he might actually take it seriously
so I'm gonna go ahead and send him the
first text oh my goodness let's get just
so you know I'm gonna start with the
second verse of the song just because I
feel like it makes more sense for me to
say oh my god it's son I was so scared
oh my god he's typing oh I hate this I
hate say whoa oh my god he's ready oh my
girl needs read it go on dot dot dot
he's typing again what is he saying
oh he stopped typing because he changed
his mind why are you being so dramatic I
don't know if he knows that I'm joking I
actually I think you might actually
think he might kind of know that I'm
joking
or like I'm being weird I think he can
tell that I'm being weird okay I'm gonna
hit him with the next lyric
this is something I would never actually
say to anyone in real life I don't even
know what that sentence means it just
doesn't look romantically correct to me
he's ready oh my god
why are you okay oh he thinks up like
something's wrong
Oh
no it's fine it's fine I'm gonna hit him
with the neck slit right now really want
to work this out really really wanna
work this is so bad
I don't know if he's actually thinking
that I'm being serious or I bet he's
just really confused oh my god he's
typing he's doping oh I do too but I
don't know what we're working out here
Sophie felt like me and Matt don't have
any problems in our relationship so this
probably seems so weird to him it's just
such strange on the rigs to just be like
so dramatic like they are very dramatic
and I'm not really getting to the point
I wonder what we think here right now
okay next lyric tells me to kick on the
train I thought we were okay what do you
mean have I done something wrong I feel
so bad I feel so good I'm really
confused I would be too mad don't worry
okay so this is the lyric where
gets real I think it's this week I call
it send it
I can't I actually call okay I don't
know what he's gonna say to this I
really don't imagine if he's like
alright see ya bye I'd be like no please
okay he's typing I don't understand
what's wrong we were fine on skype last
night how can you say stuff like there's
crying a face oh no oh my god no I am
literally the worst person in the world
oh my god this next lyric is a HD critic
this is like the worst like this I've
picked like one of the best songs I
think to do for this tell me
oh because we love each other question
mark I don't understand how you can
change your mind so easily is that the
fact that you've been stressed lately oh
I have been stressed lately like I think
he knows so maybe that's why he thinks
that I'm doing this what's the next
thing when I'm home being a healthy baby
okay hairy guys only after this Laura
she might actually catch on that it's
like a prank maybe I don't know why are
you hurting this sounds so legit because
I have been so busy lately and I've been
stressed out and like I've had so many
things to do so he's probably gonna
really feel like I'm trying to like to
ditch him because I got so much stuff to
do I know what we can work for it
together I'm just so confused if you're
serious or not I think he might not at
this point
I think you might never after this one
because it's not something I would
usually say what sort of the metaphor
this question mark are you alone or are
you trying to pull a prank I think he
knows I think you know imagine if I was
for real though and I was trying to be
like really deep and you know
metaphorical and you were just like
what's for the metaphors oh my god is
calling me okay answer hello all right
no I first you know I Frank to you how
did you know it was a prank no you won
when did you know that it was like a
prank though no yeah that's what you
wouldn't think that it was like no more
for me to say but you probably
especially knew towards the end because
with all the methyls yeah it's just
getting really dramatic was a bit I got
you so that is the video it actually
went quite well if I say so myself and
honestly that was like my first prank
ever so I think it went pretty brilliant
