I hope you guys are doing super well get
everything done the title today I'm
going to be doing an April tool because
you guys really like my Primark haul
last time I did it and I don't even
expect you guys to like my tools as much
because I don't know it's not really
like the type of video that I usually
film but since you guys really like to
be prime Osborne I thought hey I might
as well for my next one too so now that
it's transitioning is the spring time
here in the UK I thought I would pick up
some new bit and try new things like
wearing color like I don't usually wear
color so I thought I would branch out
and in the process of that I thought I
would show you guys what I picked up if
you guys enjoyed this video make sure
you smash a few thumbs up just down
below and will be subscribing to our
brand new apart without further ado
let's get into the video okay so the
third piece that I picked up is there's
really nice white shirt I don't really
know how to describe it but it looks
very Victorian II to me it's like
breathe freely and just really Christian
guarding it really reminds me of
something that my friend marks here from
peopie market would wear and it's just
like so pretty I don't usually go for
things like this I used to love this
kind of style so much another dress like
this all the time I really love the
detailing on there and it's just like
really feminine and just really pretty
you like I don't have to get it the next
thing I do is kind of to go with that
pop and it's been really nice skirt it
actually has pockets for once like it's
gonna I think I walking into what the
heck I really love the color I can't
wash this really nice metallic kind of
gold specks going through it and it's
pink and drive no I love pink lately but
this is from the ground that's mr. Jane
I'm going to have all the prices like in
this corner or in this corner whatever
to kind of show you guys what everything
costs I can't remember off the top of my
head another big item by god is this
really nice off the shoulder kind of
tops like this really nice dusty pink
color it's wrong with the brand pretty
little thing but I've got on a source
obviously this is such a cool brand I
really love their stuff I'd have a few
pairs of shoes from them and all system
Club honestly I really like witches will
seem so I was really surprised that they
actually solve this in a sauce because I
didn't realize that they were one of the
brands that they actually have you know
for asking me where I got this from
there were at like two videos ago or
something and yeah this is basically
some ethos I'll have the link down below
with everything so you guys can check it
out if you would like it so even though
it's spring time it is getting warmer
there are still a few days that are like
really cold and you just want to wrap up
in something warm so I thought what
better way to wrap up in something warm
but still be Springs like if you get a
really bright colored jumper so I got
this really nice neutral turtleneck and
it's a bright blue and you can be like
honestly I don't ever wear colors like
this but I really really like it and
just trying to branch out as I said
trying to branch out into the world of
color because while aware is great black
white and news that's and pink in a hole
I wear ever so this is a really nice
switch hub and I just love how nice it
is so soft the next thing I picked up is
this and you guys climb and tortoises
but it's basically black dungarees
I always trouble finding don't read that
actually fit me on my bottom half like
an actual good pair of jeans so when I
got this in the post and I tried it on I
was like yes yes absolutely so so well
besides the hi-low is size pen if you're
wondering well yeah I've always wanted
like just a plain pair of dungarees are
black because it's such a staple piece
for like any wardrobe and it is I can
pretty much anything it's such an easy
and quick outfit okay another thing is
kind of me branching out into new
fashion styles so I asked the ended up
getting you this two-piece I think I can
tell it's really not my style at all but
the summary is I really liked out of the
website so I thought oh hey I'm going to
give it a go because I like trying new
things it's like this doctor's clinic
pattern it's red and navy which is like
colors that I never ever wear but I do
really like it really nice the spring
and it kind of makes me feel like really
sophisticated and posh and this is the
skirt for a it's pretty much the same
pattern but it's got like this really
nice little slit at the bottom which is
just like a nice little touch the next
item that
is actually address whoever thought that
Roxy would be wearing the dress I need
to me like live in jeans and I never
want to wear skirts or dresses on like
okay this year I have to like actually
be a girl and I'm going to actually wear
dresses and skirts for one so ended up
getting this mustard-colored dress from
the ground sister gained again this is
such a lovely dress I never would think
to pick anything like this up from
anywhere because it's really not my soul
once again but I really liked it for
some reason I really like how this kind
of colored looks with my hair like I
think this color blue suit blonde I mean
it suits any colors of hair but I really
like how it looks for blonde so I got it
and it's just really really pretty makes
me think of like comics in Wonderland
for some reason so the next thing I got
is a trench coat now this kind of looks
a little bit different on the website
than it does here I don't really know if
I like it to be on it but I'm going to
give a go I'm going to try it on and see
what it looks like as like a fall outfit
I thought it would be kind of like a
different material is very thin and it's
like kind of like silky I didn't think
it would be like this but hey hey I
still really like the color though what
do you guys think I think it's really
pretty
I've been looking for a really nice red
coat like this for a while but I'm not
gonna lie
thank you this is going to be a
paralyzed item of clothing I got is this
oh my gosh I love we're going to sleep
on it it's so soft it's this really nice
fluffy shaggy kind of foot look it's a
really nice shaggy faux fur coat yes
it's faux fur like I'd never buy real
fun so this is so sweet really soft and
I love Clips like this it just made me
feel like so sophisticated and like
feverish I don't know I've got a blank
version of this but it's not as fluffy
and I honestly live in the black version
which I've got from Primark you guys
probably have seen a thousand times on
my Instagram and stuff but I thought I
need a white version or like a cream
kind of version just because I like the
color like you never have enough hope
guys now moving on its you like the
accessories and shoes the first thing I
got is this metallic backpack this isn't
like the ultimate mini backpack but it's
still quite mini and if y'all have been
very in an on trend at the moment so I
picked one up because I needed a
backpack for a while I haven't actually
got one so I thought why not pick up a
rose gold / Hopalong because what a
build is like my favorite color like I
have right there and risk of there you
guys probably already know this but it
really really pretty is very nice
metallic and shiny
okay so now this is my most favorite
part of this whole I when I saw these
online our lives oh my gosh I can you'll
see this in an outfit with that backpack
that I just showed you and if these are
they are literally copper shoes like and
their platforms are like this is just
these have stolen my heart guys the
inspiration behind these is this one guy
that I saw literally in London at London
Fashion Week and he was wearing like the
most casual outfit it was just like
black and then at the bottom he had
metallic shoes like this and I was like
holy cow why does I never buy metallic
shoes in my life because they just make
an outfit like that's all you need you
just need like simple black clothing and
then with a pop of color of this and
you're sorted I'm definitely going to
get a lot of wear out these because
they're platforms and they are copper do
I need to say anything else but the next
thing that I picked up from a cloth is
this really gorgeous clutch bag you can
make into a clutch 5 April to make it
into like an actual little purse and
this is from pet beta it is so super
sweet look how gorgeous it is this was a
little bit pricier was like a hundred
pound wedding I needed buy bags are
expensive but I really liked this I love
the bar I think it's just so classic it
kind of makes me think of like Chanel
for some reason I don't know but I
really like and it's got a really nice
gold chain as well it's just a very
dainty handbag
those days where like wearing a dress or
a start which I'm definitely going to
try to do more often with all the stuff
that I bought but yeah I really really
like it it's just so precious the last
few things I've got to show you guys are
two pairs of shoes so the first pair are
these these are like Payton pleather
obviously shoes from new life these are
so so pretty I don't know how I feel
about how shiny they are cuz they're
like very very reflection especially
with my studio lights but I really like
the color and I think this is very like
understated they kind of show of any
outfit so I thought why not beat them up
and then after issues are these ones but
these are so so cool I really love the
studying effect all the way around the
boots and they are just like the perfect
hype like I go that we have any high
heels like this that I like little boots
that are not too tall to kind of wear on
a daily basis so I'm really really good
that I've got these because they look
amazing so like these are going to go
with pretty much any outfit and they're
kind of like edgy as well they have like
this really unique stubbing which I
don't see a lot of boots have on the
market so I'm definitely going to get a
lot of use out of these so that was all
for my triangle from a 12 I really hope
you guys enjoyed yeah I'm just kind of
like testing the waters of etiquette I
don't know if you guys are going to like

do a more a softball because I shall
