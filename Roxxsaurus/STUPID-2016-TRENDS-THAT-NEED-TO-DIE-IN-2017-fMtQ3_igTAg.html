channel I hope you guys are doing super
well the first things first it is the
first day of 2017
that is literally insane 2016 has
whizzed by so quickly but I hope you
guys had an amazing New Year's Eve and I
hope you guys enjoyed yourself today I
thought I would do another little recap
of 2016 we can't leave that year without
addressing some of the most ridiculous
trends in history that have happened
I've kind of emerged from 2016
I've already seen this video go around
on YouTube a few days ago and I watched
it and I loved it so much I saw my
friend Luis from looking for Luis duet
as well as Wayne Goss I'll leave them in
the description so you guys can check
them up because I thought they were
hilarious and so true so today I thought
I would put my own spin on this video
and basically tell you guys what friends
I think it should be completely ditched
in 2017 so a little disclaimer I'm of
course not trying to offend anyone in
this video I am just merely roasting
2016 and all of the ridiculous trends
that have happened during this year and
of course I'm guilty of some of these
I'm not gonna lie I've done a lot of
these things and I'll probably still
keep doing them yes a lot of the makeup
trends that I'm gonna mention in this
video are of course down to like opinion
and personal taste so if you do any of
these don't get offended this is just my
opinion because I don't like them
doesn't mean that you can't do them you
do you go you do you if you guys enjoyed
this video make sure you smash that huge
thumbs up just down below and also
subscribe if you are brand new I would
love to have you here also have a lot
channel and social media like all of
them so if you haven't got a New Year's
resolution yet well there you go there's
one that you can actually keep go follow
me and subscribe all that ever adieu
let's get into the video okay so the
trend that completely and just needs to
go extinct in 2017
and I think this is probably a very
popular opinion and a lot of you will
agree with me on this that is the whole
life hack beauty hacks with knives and
forks I mean come on like it's kitchen
utensils like stop I get that the people
are trying to come up with new things
and new packs but when it actually takes
much longer out of your daily routine to
go out of your way and do a hack than it
is not a hack I'm sorry but it's not and
also the second reason that it needs to
die is because it's just completely and
utterly ridiculous and it's so dangerous
sometimes you have to stop and think who
is actually going to watch this and what
kind of impact is it going to have on
them because there's probably a lot of
people who are young and impressionable
on the internet and when they see
someone applying a knife to their face
and using that as a guide for contour
I'm sorry but that's just a recipe for
disaster I know I'm guilty of using
weird hacks in my videos but I always
try to make them one safe too relevant
and three actually hacks because I mean
go into your kitchen picking up a knife
and contouring with it is definitely not
going to save any time in your day the
next trend is quite up-and-coming I've
only seen this recently on YouTube and
that is the experiment 1000 degree
cutting video I honestly don't even know
what that's about
I've watched a few of those and I was
just like why like what is the internet
coming to I mean people are heating up a
knife on the internet and then slicing
through a load of products most of them
are quite expensive makeup products and
I'm just like no like please do not cut
through an urban decay eyeshadow palette
please and I see the comments of the
viewers of these videos and they're just
like you could have given that to me
come oh that's why I think that should
kind of die as soon as possible even
though it hasn't even like reached his
peak yet
now the third trend that needs to die in
2017 is also one that I'm kind of
slightly guilty of and that is the whole
tin
man knows highlight chain on some noses
a bit of highlight on the tip of the
nose can just look so beautiful
it can literally work wonders because it
can lift the nose if your nose is quite
short but when you excessively apply
highlight to your nose it's kind of a
bit much it ends up looking a little bit
greasy and a little bit like metallic
it's all falling games until you end up
looking like Tin Man you don't want to
look like that following on from
highlight there's the contour contouring
everything that is the new trend
apparently in 2016 we are now contouring
next elbows probably other parts of the
body that kind of don't want to know
about contouring like chest and like
this area which I guess it's still okay
but when it's like contouring your arms
and legs and like your neck like even
the back of your neck I mean what is the
point like just please like stop doing
it's a waste of makeup - waste of your
time and none of you guys need to do
that the next trend that needs to die in
2017 is the furry nails as well as these
pom-pom nails I've seen this briefly on
the internet a few times like on
Instagram and like a few articles and I
just thought why like just why what's
the point it's so impractical I imagine
having pom-poms on the end of your
fingernails what use is that the next
one is another youtube trend and that is
the Orbeez and phloem why need I say
anything else I mean I know a lot of
people watch those videos and I'm not
like judging anyone in particular
there's way too many of them now like
one is enough there's like Orbeez stress
balls flown stressful edible stress
balls I'm just like please stop like
this enough stress pose now I get that
it's fun I get this for kids but
personally for me I'm just like nah it's
got a die its Gaga
showing that needs to go is the account
probably going to get some hate for this
or some mixed opinions about this but
it's the lace-up strappy hops I
personally I really like them and they
are lovely but they are very much
overused now I am sure wall on the other
day so I'm guilty of doing it myself but
everyone is wearing them it's like that
era when people started wearing like
Topshop Joni jeans with a black leather
coat it's that thing all over again it's
like everyone is a complete clone of
each other I personally really like it
but I'm probably going to ditch in 2017
the last render needs to die is the
excessively ripped jeans
I'm obviously an enthusiast of the
ripped jeans I have countless of pairs
of the ripped jeans but there's a big
but when it comes to the point that
literally your jeans have like like
chalk like chunks of missing denim in
them that's when you kind of have to
like reevaluate yourself and think okay
am I wearing actual trousers or am i
wearing like shorts with like some
dangly bits I don't see the point you
might as well just go for shorts if you
don't want to wear anything on your legs
it just doesn't make sense to me
this next one is a roast of a lot of my
friends actually and even myself because
this is a very much blogger based trend
and it's the whole well I'm going to
call this the blogger coach where the
people hang their coat over their
shoulders and not actually wear the coat
it looks good for photos I guess I've
done it once before but it's so
impractical it's actually really hard to
get the coat on your shoulders and if
you don't want to wear the coat why have
you got the coat why don't you just put
your arms in it's so much easier so
that's a trend that I've kind of noticed
over the blogger world and I never
really understood it I'm not gonna lie
and Allah
trail of 2016 is well this has been kind
of an ongoing issue for the past
probably five years and it's the fact
that people still wear sheer leggings as
trousers like we've all we all know now
that you see everything underneath even
if you wear a thong I can see what color
song you're wearing you know I really
just think about that a little it's
alright for loungewear but I wouldn't
really wear it out so that's just my
opinion no one wants to see it underwear
girl I'm just saying I'm just saying so
those are the trends that I personally
and I'm sure a lot of you will also
agree with this um think that these
should die in 2017 like come on it's a
brand new year we don't have to mess it
up with these new ridiculous trends or
bringing the old ones into the new year
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
