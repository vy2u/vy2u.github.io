this Halloween vampire makeup tutorial I
hope you guys like it and before we jump
straight in I've done another Halloween
video on my boyfriend's channel so if
you guys want to check that out there'll
be a little video down here and also in
the description box and over there on
his channel I turned him into tape from
American Horror Story with the skull
face and the hot outfit and stuff like
that if you guys haven't checked that
out and definitely check the link and
the video down here that's me I'm
starting off with my naked 2 palette and
I'm taking the brown shadow to sweep
that into the crease as a transition
shade I'm then taking my sleek blush in
shade flush and I'm using my zoeva
crease brush to blend that into the
crease and add further dimension to the
eye the reason why we're using a red
tone shadow onto the eyes is actually to
make the eyes look much more irritated
and tired like a vampire
even though about PO Never Sleeps but
that's beside the point and then taking
the shadow black out from my Naked 2
palette and then I'm popping that onto
the lid I'm really dabbing the shadow on
rather than sweeping it about because
you want to get the most pigmentation
using this technique and I also started
doing my eyes rather than the face first
is because you're going to get a lot of
fallout with a dramatic eye look like
this so you always want to do the eye
makeup first and then that do the skin
last I'm now just tight lining my lower
lash line with this same shadow next I'm
using my Schwing eyeliner by the balm
and I'm creating a cat wing with this
and then reaching for my snazaroo
water-based face paint in shade white
and I'm just dabbing that very lightly
over the highest point of my face almost
using this as a highlighter and then I'm
using my Real Techniques foundation
brush to blend all of that out
to achieve this sunken in vampire cheeks
I'm using my sleek or natural palette
and I'm taking the gray eyeshadow from
this palette and I'm just popping that
into the hollows of my cheeks using a
Real Techniques contour brush for the
famous at vampire red lips I'm using a
MAC lipstick in shade diva and then to
finish off the lips I'm just going in
with a black shadow around the lips to
sort of outline it and create a subtle
gradient effect with a lip
and this is the final leg if you want to
go a step further you can add some fake
blood to the corners of your lips to
make it look like you've just sunk in
your teeth into someone's neck so that
is all guys I hope you guys enjoyed this
video this is probably going to be the
last Halloween tutorial that I'm doing
this year so yeah I hope you guys are
going to have a lovely Halloween
stay safe and also don't forget to check
out the video that I found over on my
boyfriend's channel where I turned him
into Tate I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I'll see you very soon
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
