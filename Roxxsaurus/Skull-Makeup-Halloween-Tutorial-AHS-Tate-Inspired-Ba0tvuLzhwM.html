are some water-based paints the ones
that I'm using are the color classic by
snazaroo this is brand I've been using
for years so they're really really good
and they last forever and I'm also going
to be using some eyeshadow and I'm going
to use at the slick palette and this is
in all natural 6:01 because it's got
some gray and black shades in this which
will help me with shading I'm going to
use three brushes I'm going to use a
foundation brush a smaller sort of light
concealer brush and a precision brush
this is actually like a paint brush but
I don't really have a really small
makeup brush for precision and I'm also
going to use a beauty blender to blend
everything else but this is optional so
the first step is pretty important is
just to cover your whole face in white
so as you can see I left out my neck and
eyes for now because we're going to
cover that in black anyway so the next
step is to of course do the outline of
the eyes which is going to be all black
once you are looking like a right-hander
you can move on to the nose and nose is
really unique to everyone so just try
and go with what your nose looks like
and what you think would look good on it
you
next we're going to move on to the sides
of the skull but linking with the teeth
this bit is kind of tricky but if you
follow the steps and I'm going to try
and make it as easy as possible
so my camera just cut out but basically
what I did is repeated the same to the
other side and just outline my teeth a
little bit and now we can move on to the
shading which is the most fun part so
I'm taking my sneak palette and I'm
going to use this gray with a sort of
like a flat brush and I'm going to do
the outlining of like the nose the eyes
and just everything basically
so we're pretty much done and the last
thing I'm going to do is return back to
white and add some highlight onto the
teeth to make them look more
three-dimensional
and unfortunately because my battery is
about to die I'm gonna have to stop here
and I won't do the neck but if I could
have time to charge my battery I would
do like a little spine thing and then
black on here but I can't because I have
work and I don't have time to charge my
battery so I'm really sorry about that
but I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
anyway just their face and I think it
looks really fun for Halloween it's
pretty simple really easy you don't need
too much resources to do this and yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I'll see
you in my next video bye
this thing is this lovely place suit and
you guys have probably seen this like
everywhere because I'm just obsessed
with it probably seen it in my Poland
vlog and on Instagram and just
everywhere and I just think it's amazing
it's so unique and I love sunflowers
sunflowers are one of my favorite
flowers and I think that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
