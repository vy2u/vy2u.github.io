a festive party look for you guys this
can be worn for like Christmas parties
or news Eve parties I think it's really
versatile and the best part is that it's
drugstore so I'm actually using this kit
by L'Oreal to make this whole look and
this is the smoky extravaganza look
they've got four different boxes that
you can choose from and it's just
basically the easiest thing you can
think of it's basically a look in a box
so you can't go wrong with that I think
that this box will also make a really
cool Christmas gift so get your hands on
one of those any kind of person that
wears makeup in your life for this will
be a perfect gift for them so about that
ready let's just jump right into the
video so first thing I'm going to start
with my L'Oreal infallible 24 hour matte
foundation and I'm just popping that
underneath my eyes and on top of the
bridge of my nose to kind of highlight
it I'm not going to be setting this with
any powder because it's already a really
matte foundation next I'm reaching for
my L'Oreal Paris glam bronze litera face
and body some powder and I'm using this
to contour my face and then there's me
jamming to some music let me know down
below if you do this is what often your
applying makeup you just sing to random
songs out there next I'm taking my
L'Oreal Paris brow artist genius kit and
there's two shades I'm gonna be using
the lighter shade for my eyebrows and
I'm just filling in some sparse areas of
my brows like the arch and the tail kind
of thing now I'm gonna be reaching
forward the Xtravaganza smokey kit and
from this I'm gonna be using the l'oreal
eyeshadow quad i love the eye shadows
unless they're so creamy and really
pigmented and it's basically of a
high-end product kind of quality but you
pay so much less for it so firstly i'm
applying the second lightest shade and
that's like a silvery kind of metallic
color and i'm just applying that all
over the lid as a light wash and then
taking the lightest shade on a flat
brush and i'm applying this white into
the inner corners to kind of open up the
eye and add some reflectiveness to the
inner corners I'm now taking in the
third shade which is a dark grey and I'm
applying that in the outer corners in a
sea
these shadows are really awesome because
it's so creamy and really easy to blend
so as you can see it hardly takes me any
effort to blend all the colors together
and then I'm going in with a flat brush
once again and I'm just dragging that
same color underneath on my lower lash
line to tie the whole look together now
taking the darkest shadow from this
quads I'm taking a smaller fluffy brush
and I'm applying that further into the
outer corner to kind of accentuate the
smokiness of it I'm also running that
down along the lower lash line with the
same fluffy brush the next up is really
important you wanna take a bigger fluffy
brush preferably one that's clean and
you're gonna blend everything out all
the harsh edges so that you get a smooth
transition of the colors if you want you
can go back to the darkest shade and
kind of build up the color into the
outer crease I'm then reaching back for
the white eyeshadow and I'm using that
as a brow bone highlight so I'm just
applying that with a angled brush just
below the brow next up is the L'Oreal
Paris super liner called a smoked kissy
me I think I'm saying that right I
really like this liner for smokey looks
because the tip is really thick which
allows you to get a really smoky nice
effect for this look I'm actually not
going to dramatic with the liner I just
want to keep it kind of really close to
the lash line so I'm just doing that
here and then I'm reaching for an angled
brush and picking up some of that
product to create a faded out smoky
liner
now I'm reaching for a mascara and this
is the volume million lashes one this is
really great for volume eyes lashes and
if you want to achieve the false eyelash
look then this is your mascara and of
course last step is the lips so I'm
reaching for the nude shade that comes
in the Xtravaganza box and this is in
shade of six trio it's a really nice
natural looking color like your lips but
better so that is all for this makeup
thing I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and if you decide to recreate
and make sure to let me know and tag me

same look I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I'll see you very soon
