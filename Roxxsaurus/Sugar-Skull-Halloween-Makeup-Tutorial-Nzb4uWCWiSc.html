whole face in white facepaint and I'm
using the sponge to kind of dab it in
and get an even complexion once your
whole face is a tinted watch you can
move on to the eyes i'm using the
snazaroo paint in purple and a sort of
like a big dome brush and all I'm going
to do is sort of outline the shape of my
eyes once you're happy with the shape
you can go ahead and use some black
snazaroo paint and outline the shape of
your eyes next what I'm going to do is
just sort of draw a design around the
eyes you can do whatever shape you like
but what I'm gonna do it's a sort of
like a petal design which is really
really simple once the eyes are done I'm
going to move on to the nose you can do
whatever nose shape you like this isn't
supposed to be like a realistic skull so
you can go crazy with this which is the
best thing about a sugar skull makeup
because it's so personal and you can
actually do whatever design you want to
do so I'm just going to go with gut
instinct and do like a little triangle
with split in the center like I did for
my last year's Halloween makeup once the
nose is done you can remove the lips the
lips are really simple all you have to
do is extend your mouth line and then
draw on some teeth just to make it a
little bit more different I'm gonna go
down and create a little bang like tooth
or whatever you'd like to call it and
then extend it as usual
I've jumped into any of the coloring I'm
gonna move on to the little design my
forehead and chin and just on the cheeks
just just the regular sort of sugar
skull design this is again very personal
so you can do whatever you want and yeah
what I'm gonna do on my forehead is
create this little lotus flower because
lotus flowers are my favorite flowers so
I'm just going to do that on my forehead
but again you can do whatever you want
once the main sort of design is done you
can move on to the colors and I'm going
to use blue to fill in my lips flower
with and afterwards you can shade it in
using eye shadows all over you like or
you can just keep it very two
dimensional I'm also going to fill in
the petals around my eyes with the sago
stain
now I'm going to go in with some
eyeshadows to do the shading I'm going
to keep this very blue and purple based
but again you can use whatever colors
you like and the pilot that I'm going to
be using is the sleek makeup palette in
all RL 601 this is one of my favorite
makeup artists at the moment I've been
using it so much because the colors are
amazing so I'm just going to using the
purple shadow from this palette to sort
of go around my eyes and make them much
more three-dimensional and give them
more depth once the shading of the eyes
is done I'm going to use the same shadow
and sort of dab it slightly onto the lip
and shade the underneath of my teeth
next I'm going to go in with a great eye
shadow from the same palette and shade
the teeth to make them look much more 3d
and realistic looking
now I'm going to go into the little
petals around my eyes with some whites
to create a little cross in each one of
them to make them look like diamonds
next I'm going to apply a tiny bit of
blush to add a bit more color to my face
and the one I'm using is spiced leek in
flesh no.35
I'm sort of dabbing it in one point to
create a doll-like effect and we are
done you can do whatever you want with
the eyes I think I'm just going to leave
them like this I don't want any mascara
on or anything but you can't apply
mascara eyeliner anything you like
I personally quite like how this looks
just by itself so that is the final look
I hope you guys enjoyed this this is
really really simple and perfect for
like a last-minute Halloween costume or
makeup what I'm wearing is just black
this black shirt with like polka dots on
it you can literally wear whatever you
like so yeah I hope you like this and I
hope you have a happy Halloween stay
safe you guys um and don't eat too many
sweets because your teeth will fall out
so that is all point video I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I will see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
