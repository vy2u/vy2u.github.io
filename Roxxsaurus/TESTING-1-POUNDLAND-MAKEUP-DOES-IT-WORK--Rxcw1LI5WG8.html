hope you guys have an awesome day so far
so today I'm really really excited cuz
I'm going to be filming a testing panel
and makeup you guys I've already tried
at Primark makeup maybe two minutes ago
to victory guys and check that out as
well but today I'm twisting your pal my
makeup I'm so excited because I've never
actually purchased or tried panel on
makeup so this is like a first
impression and testing out to you guys
for the first time ever so I'm hoping
some of you guys having tried tongueless
makeup either if you haven't then this
is like the perfect video for you guys
to see what promise work and what
products are worth the money
do you guys enjoy this video make sure
you smash sexy photos up just down below
and also subscribe if you haven't
already because I'd love to have your
hair come and join the dinosaur family
I also before you go make sure you guys
are following me on my second channel
Rock Sora's blog post blogs daily if you
go head over there and subscribe we can
hang out every day what's not to love
about that
well our over angling let's get into the
video okay so the first product I am
picked up is of course foundation so
this is the gorgeous flawless long
lasting foundation with UVA and UVB of
filters I got this in it shade ivory and
I'm really hoping is going to match
there wasn't that many shades to choose
from when I was in my local store so I'm
going to see if this one work okay so so
far the consistency looks quite moosie
which I like and we're going to apply
this with a flat top brush so the shape
of the plane right now was the brightest
shade of all and still it's a little bit
hard for me even though I'm tan right
now it's very heavy and very cakey it
also leaves quite a bit of shrieking as
my initial kind of opinion I really
don't like the foundation like you can
see every single hair on my face and it
kind of makes me look like I've got a
beard so this is kind of what my face
looks like it's very good coverage
however like I say it does look a little
bit heavy and cakey and you know how
people have like a little bit of heads
around here you can see every single
hair I have on my face so overall I
would clean in a foundation that matches
my skin tone quite well now that is
blended in I would say it's a little bit
on the heavy
so I probably get the foundation at 3:00
after 10:00 just because I really don't
like the formula but I think it's way
too heavy if you can see the hair in my
face
that is definitely a no-no for me now
the next product I'm going to use is a
concealer so this one here is called the
hide and chic concealer with natural
coverage it comes in like a little stick
and I'm pretty sure this is the only
shade you can get I don't know about you
guys but I don't really get along with
stick concealers all foundations so I'm
going to see how this goes I'm just
going to apply this under my eyes it's
very hard and like the formula isn't I
don't know it's just not great so I'm
not going to blend this out with a
little flat brush and so far it's quite
into blend however I don't really like
how it sits on the skin but we will see
it once it's all blended out so this is
the concealer blended out this is what
it looks like I would say it covered up
my dark circles pretty well but does it
look good on my skin I honestly don't
think so I think it was quite heavy and
a little bit cakey on the skin it just
doesn't sit very well on the skin in my
opinion so the next product is a pressed
powder I think I'm going to get a little
bit pretty well because press powders
are usually quite good like I don't see
how a pressed powder can be bad so I'm
just gonna swirl this in with my big
brush and just apply this all in my face
to set it so the powder is definitely
the best product I've tried up to date
I feel like powder you just can't go
wrong with a powder and it's quite cheap
and easy to make anyways even for
high-end brands so I would give this
probably a 7 out of 10 I'm now going to
move on to you wrong flower runs like my
favorite product to ever apply my face
so this is be good to glow matte bronzer
so the bronzer I'm quite skeptical about
because it looks and little bit orange e
in the pan but we will see if it looks
any different on the skin so I'm just
going to apply this with a big dome
brush like this just to add some depth
to my face like my whole is my cheeks
and my temples and just so generally it
runs up the skin
so far so good I don't feel like it
looks that orange I mean it is a little
bit on the warm tone side a little bit
too warm for my liking but I don't think
is completely terrible and it is matte
so that's always good so this is the
bronzer / contour finish I think it
turned out pretty good I think it is a
little bit on the warm tone side but it
is still super wearable so I definitely
would rock this out and I think I would
give this about an 8 out of 10
next up is of course a blusher so this
is the color I went for it's like a
really neutral rosy color this is in
shade soft blush one I think I'm really
going to like the product it's a really
really nice color so I'm just going to
pick some of that product up and just
apply this to my apples of my cheeks so
that is the blusher finish I'm really
impressed with the blush I really like
the color the pigmentation payoff is
great
i'ma definitely recommend to buy this
little blush because it's only a pound
so I'm currently go wrong I would
probably give this as 10 out of 10
because out of all the products I've
tried so far this is the best one okay
up next is a highlighter this is the
thing I'm most excited to try this is be
good to glow highlighting powder it's a
really nice color inside and I'm just
really excited to see if it's going over
so I'm just going to apply this onto my
brush and again just sweep it onto my
cheek bone
whoa I'm actually really impressed with
this one and so beautiful like the glow
is really pigmented and the shimmer
isn't too chunky which I find would like
cheapish kind of highlighters you get
they're like glitter really super chunky
which I don't like but this one it you
can tell is very finely milled I think
I've changed my mind
my favorite product is now this one so I
would also give this a 10 out of 10 so
now that the face is finished I'm going
to move on to the brows somebody's
essential eyebrow kit that I've got here
this was again a pound
obviously everything in the
pound-for-pound land and we have some
pretty nice colors in here what I liked
about this is the fact of every nice and
cool tone so let's see if it's going to
work my eyebrows already quite full but
I'm just going to fill in any of the spa
kind of areas so far that's looking
pretty good guys these are the brows
finish I think they still look pretty
good I mean I'm very particular with the
way my eyebrows look especially towards
the beginning here I feel like I could
cover them out pretty well this product
is really easy to blend and the color is
not warm tone which is amazing now
moving on to the eyes you can they don't
actually sell any eyeshadow palettes in
town and I'm just going to easing the
same eyebrow kit and just use like the
lightest shade of brown just to apply to
my cream and add a little bit of
definition there okay first thing I
noticed is that there is so much fallout
when you use it as an eyeshadow if you
guys see this glow much fallout but the
color payoff is definitely quite strong
with some as my transition color finish
I'm now just going to take the little
highlight color which is like this white
shimmery pearlescent color from the
eyebrow kit I'm just going to apply this
to the very center of my lid for a nice
little pop of color that is actually
really beautiful oh my gosh so the one
thing that my pan one didn't have was a
black liner so I actually had to get a
brown one which I'm quite gutted about
but I'm sure it's still going to work
pretty well I never really use brown
eyeliner so this was going to be quite
the switch up
so this is one I done I actually quite
liked the color does dry a bit darker
making it look like it's actually black
this is the finished eyeliner I really
am happy with how it turned out and I
love the color however I would say that
the little applicator that the eyeliner
comes with is not precise enough like it
kind of separates a lot I don't know if
you guys can see that but it kind of
separates into little bristles and it
means that it kind of messes up your
Sharp eyeliner application either you
could always use a different brush if
you did purchase this eyeliner X is the
actual product inside it pretty good so
I would probably give this a 6 out of 10
down to finish off the eye I'm going to
be onto mascara and the one that I
picked up is called the plum part of the
volume mascara from Poundland as well so
first things that I noticed that it's
quite dry which means that it doesn't
distribute a lot of the product onto the
lashes it is nicely like separating
though but I don't think it's making
them any more volume eyes so this does
the finished result of the mascara I
feel like it didn't really give me a
much volume but it's definitely given me
a lot of length and it's really
separated my lashes like you can see if
I look up my lashes do not really have a
car the quest flat but when I look up
you'll be able to see like how nicely
separated they are I've also gone and
bought some fake lashes from Primark
these actually look pretty nice so as
well as the makeup I'm also going to see
if they're fake lashes already get whoa
guys these are the lashes and I'm
actually quite sure how good they look
like they look quite natural but they're
so like volumizing and I really like
them so I would definitely give them
like a 9 out of 10 just because they're
not the best quality but they look
amazing and lastly for this look we're
going to focus on the lips so this I'm
going to be using at the makeup gallery
nude one powder out lip liner look like
a really nice moody brown kind of color
some people airline my little bit so
this is the lip liner as you can see is
not done the greatest job out there it's
very like heart &amp;amp; Stift and when you
kind of rub it over your lips it really
kind of hurts to try and get the
pigmentation out it's not a gravy
pigmented so I'm not really that
impressed with the lip liner I would
give it like a 1 out of 10 and lastly
for the lip I'm going to be using this
matte liquid lipstick it's called the
pout matters matte lip color I'm not too
sure what shade it in but it's like the
nudie one I'm really hoping that this is
going to be good because the color is
really pretty oh my god oh my god guys
this literally no I'm not even gonna lie
this literally smells like the kind of
lip kit they smell like vanilla oh my
god that smell is so good it literally
smells like the Kylie lip kit this
formula is terrible though I really
don't like it so like gloopy and it
separates on the left once it's finished
so I think I look quite a mess to see
how it dry so this is a lipstick dry I
think I absolutely love it with the
color I like it so so pretty very
neutral for like everyday
the smell is absolutely amazing I'm not
even gonna lie English this Melbourne
Kylie lip kit and it dries it looks
pretty good it looks like nice and
smooth however when you first apply it
onto your lip it kind of looks a little
bit gloopy like when you first put it on
your lip initially it comes out really
like bumpy and like all the gloops from
the products kind of when go on your
lips but when you kind of like smoother
out and just apply it and finish it off
I think it looks pretty good
purely because of the smell I'm going to
have to give it a 10 as for the
application it's looking pretty good so
I'm going to give it a 7
so that was my panel and testing and
makeup video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and got to see some of the
products are out there and also my
opinion never weather let's go over the
work your money let's summarize
some of these products are really
amazing like the highlight and the
brothel that and the lipstick I'm
definitely most impressed with oh it
also divided up pretty good to the
foundation I would say it's a big no-no
and also the brow product could have
been a little bit better but overall I'm
really impressed with how the whole look
turned out I am actually really liking
it I would definitely wear this out so
