today I am back at you guys again with
another testing makeup video now please
excuse of my voice and my appearance
right now I am literally so ill I've
been ill for the past week or so and I
actually missed one of my uploads on
Wednesday so I'm really sorry about that
but I didn't want to miss another upload
this Sunday so I'm here and I'm filming
a video for you guys today I'm gonna be
testing out some of Pam lund makeup so I
went into Poundland and I basically just
picked up a full face over the makeup
that they sell and I'm gonna be testing
this out for you guys to see if it's any
good thing is the makeup is so cheap I
really don't know how it's gonna perform
I have done this video last year at some
point and I honestly don't even remember
if I like the makeup or not I also
picked up some new products from their
range that I haven't tried before so
we're just gonna be seeing how we get
along with them if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure you smash that here
thumbs up and just down below and also
subscribe if you are brand new I would
love to have you here come and join the
dinosaur family oh that for real ooh
let's get on into the video okay so the
first thing I'm gonna be testing out
today is the gorgeous flawless
foundation this is the long lasting
foundation with UVA filters and this is
in shade ivory 1 now honestly because
the tub looks like this and the only
sliver of color that you can see is this
part here and this little die here it
was actually quite difficult to match
the color that I would be so I just want
more ivory cuz that's usually the shade
that I tend to go for in foundations but
I have no idea if this is gonna match me
at all just gonna squirt some onto my
hand okay so the consistency is quite
interesting it feels very bouncy
okay so I've just zoomed you guys in and
I'm just gonna apply this kind of all
over my face but focus on the
imperfections because I've been ill
recently I have the worst under-eye
circles so I'm gonna try and kind of
focus my foundation under those as well
I've also got a few blemishes on my
cheeks at the moment so we're gonna see
how well this foundation will cover them
up my voice right now is literally
making me laugh so much because I sound
so nasally and I can't even help it I'm
that girl if you guys have any home
remedies on how to get well quick when
you've got like a flu or a cold let me
know
down below in the comments cuz I really
need some help ok so we're just gonna
blend this out with a big flat brush ok
so the color of the foundation is kind
of orange I don't know if you guys can
see that so I probably picked up the
wrong shade but honestly in my defense
it was very difficult to see if that
color would be my color or not ok so far
I can't really say that I'm a fan of
this foundation it's just not really
giving me that flawless coverage ok so
this is the foundation blend it out I
mean it's not the worst like at the end
of the day has you know transformed my
skin and made it look a little bit
better but at the same time it hasn't
really covered many of my blemishes like
you can still see them poking through
it's made my skin look quite orange like
as you can see it doesn't match my neck
at all anymore so yeah I mean it's not
the worst but it's also not the best
I've ever tried but I mean for 1 pound
you can't really expect amazing flawless
quality of foundation I mean for a pound
it's actually pretty decent
um but would I reach for this foundation
on a daily basis are probably not I'm
now gonna move on to concealer so for
this I'm gonna be using the hide and
chic concealer this comes in like a
lipstick sort of form like this so I'm
just gonna be popping that underneath my
eyes to hide those under-eye circles now
I'm just gonna blend this out with this
small flat brush now so far this
concealer actually seems pretty creamy
to blend out it doesn't seem too stiff
on the skin or anything I'm also going
to blend this out with my finger a
little bit just to kind of blend
everything seamlessly into the skin I
have to say it does feel a little bit
cakey on my skin but it's nothing too
crazy ok so this is the concealer blend
it out I'm actually pleasantly surprised
of how it looks like it looks pretty
flawless on my skin um like I said it
does feel a little bit cakey but it's
nothing crazy and it's definitely
something that I can live with if you
look to my face close-up you definitely
wouldn't be able to tell but I'm wearing
a concealer from Poundland
it's definitely a lot better than the
foundation so I give the concealer a
thumbs up I'm now gonna set everything
into place with the smoothly does it
pressed powder this is all
so from Pam and and I'm just gonna
basically set my concealer into place
because I feel like the concealer
although as good as it looks
it will probably crease very quickly
okay so I've just set that with the
powder and my under eyes look honestly
like the Sahara Desert like I thought
this powder was okay to begin with um
but it's made my skin look so dry I'm
not really too sure if I can do much
about it at this stage so I'm gonna have
to let it be okay moving on I'm now
gonna go for the good to glow matte
bronzer now I am quite nervous about
trying this because it looks really
orange in the pan I mean we will see if
this is any good but I honestly don't
have high hopes for it I'm just gonna
pick that up on a little flat brush like
this this is the brush that I tend to
use like every day for my bronzer and
I'm just gonna apply this into the
hollows of my cheek bones where you
usually would apply a bronzer or contour
products hmm
okay okay I'm not really that
disappointed because I kind of already
suspected that this is what this bronzer
would look like and considering it was
only a pound it's not that big of a deal
but if I was you guys
I would not purchase this because it
just looks so orange and so unnatural
I'm gonna be very light handed with this
because I don't want it to look too
orange okay so that is the bronze that
complete I honestly have to say I am NOT
a fan of it at all I just think it's so
Orange and so unnatural it just doesn't
look like it's meant to be on my skin in
person it just looks so so Orange I have
no idea if that's how it translates on
the camera now moving on to and my
favorite product to try out ever is a
highlighter you guys know I love
highlighters so much so this one is
called the good to glow highlighting
palette and this is how it looks it
looks quite a weird color for it to be a
highlight I'm not gonna lie this was the
only highlight that they had to offer so
I just had to pick it up to test it out
for you guys so I'm just gonna swallow
my little highlighter brush in there and
I'm just gonna go ahead and apply it
straight to my cheekbone
boom okay Oh God whoa okay what is that
does that look like a bruise or wha I
mean I don't need to look even more
bruised than I already do from my cold
under my eyes but yeah that is not good
luck guys that highlight is literally a
bruise on my face like it's got a weird
like brownie a purpley sort of colour to
it unfortunately I'm gonna say a big no
to this highlight moving right along
I'm gonna move on to the eyes now now
for this I'm gonna be using me makeup
gallery do the duo eyeshadows so this is
like a duo of two different eye shadows
this is actually in shade purple rain'
so basically these are the two eye
shadows inside one is like a purplish
shimmer shadow and the other ones like a
champagne color now I really like these
because I can create my regular kind of
like smokey eye with this so I thought
this would be perfect to put to the test
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm gonna take the gold shadow on a flat
brush a leg of this and I'm just gonna
apply that to the inner half of my eyes
this is actually a really pretty color I
really like the fact that it's really
glittery the only thing is it looks kind
of sheer on the eye it's not really too
much pigment apart from the glitters so
I feel like this might need a couple of
layers to really build up that pigman
I'm just gonna do the same thing to the
other side as well although it's very
glittery I feel like this a shadow is
actually quite wearable which is really
nice because I don't usually tend to
wear glitter on my eyes at all and to my
surprise there's actually no fallout to
this eyeshadow which is honestly really
good so now that the gold eyeshadow is
on I'm now gonna move on to the purple
one I'm just gonna take that on the same
brush and apply that into the outer
corners of my eyes wow that is very
pigmented look at that guys I'm really
hoping there's not gonna be too much
fallout with this one cuz that could
ruin everything I'm not just taking a
big fluffy brush and I'm gonna try and
blend that dark shadow out I've also
picked up some of that bronzer that we
use
yeah as like a transition color to try
and help me blend out of this darker
shadow the eye shadow is actually
blending out pretty well I'm actually
pleasantly surprised and there wasn't
really too much fall out as well so
that's actually really good guys I'm
honestly in love with this eye shadow
look it was so simple to achieve and
it's not something I would usually go
for but I think it looks really good and
it was so simple to do because you only
need these two eyeshadows so now that my
eye shadow is finished I'm gonna move on
to some eyeliner for this I'm gonna be
using the pro liquid eyeliner from
pam'll and it looks like this it comes
to like a little pot with a brush now
okay this brush looks kind of dodgy
bristles are kind of separating into
lots of different directions which I
have no idea how easy this will be to
apply but we're gonna give it our best
shot so with this I'm just gonna try and
recreate my very typical cat winged
liner okay so so far I'm actually
finding it really difficult to use for
some reason because the wand is actually
really short now I have no idea if
that's meant to make it easier or harder
but for me it's actually proven to
making it difficult to actually apply
like a thin line just because there's
quite a little room to maneuver with the
wand okay so my eyeliner is now done I
have to say there is nothing at all
wrong with the actual eyeliner the
product itself but the wand was really
difficult to use so if you are a person
that struggles with application of
eyeliner I probably wouldn't recommend
this or at least to use a different
brush with this product like have your
own brush on the side that you might
find easier to use because this is just
not good I'm now gonna move on to
mascara this is the one I'll be using
today it could the turn up the volume
and define mascara from Poundland yet
again I wonder what kind of wander this
is gonna be oh okay so it's like her I
guess it's like a synthetic kind of semi
thick brush I was kind of expecting this
to be a very thick and volumizer brush I
mean this is okay too so let's just go
ahead and apply a few coats of this to
my lashes okay so so far I'm kind of
noticing that there's not too much
products actually being distributed onto
my lashes which is kind of a bummer
because obviously when there's very
little mascara being put onto your
actual lashes you're not gonna get the
same effect that you kind of want
we're gonna try and build it up more and
more with a few layers and see how it
looks after okay so this mascara is
actually not as bad as I thought it was
gonna be at first it's kind of layering
up really nicely it's not really
crumbling off as I'm trying to apply it
either so so far I actually think it's
pretty decent the only thing I would
have to say about it is that it does
feel kind of dry already and obviously
I've just opened it it's a brand new
mascara so this is probably gonna dry
out pretty quick okay so lastly for the
lip I'm gonna be using a lip liner first
so this is called the pouty out lip
liner in shade red for I'm gonna use
this to line my lips first woah that is
actually really creamy I did not expect
that I am actually pleasantly surprised
at this lip liner I feel like it's
actually a really pretty color it was so
easy to apply as well so I give this lip
liner a big thumbs up I'm now gonna move
on to the lipstick so for the lipstick
I'm gonna be using the pout matters
matte lip color it looks like this it's
a very pretty like vibrant red color so
I'm excited to use it so I'm just
basically gonna go over the lip liner
that we've applied whoo Ashley smells
really nice it smells of vanilla this is
such a pretty color I am in love with it
it feels really soft on my lips too
which I did not expect for Poundland
lipstick to feel like this it actually
looks pretty smooth on my lips too and I
mean at the moment I have really chapped
and dry lips because I'm ill so that's
actually really surprising so this is
the finished look I really hope you guys
like here let's have a quick little
rundown of all the products so I
definitely really like the lipstick I
think it's so pretty a really nice
application I definitely really like the
eyeshadow too I have to say all of the
skin products were just pretty much
unknown like the foundation was really
orange the concealer was actually okay
it was a loaf of cakey but it wasn't the
worst now powder was very drying the
highlighter wasn't really what I was
kind of looking for and the bronzer was
just way too orange so yeah I think
overall
the lipstick the lip liner the eyeshadow
and the mascara were definitely my
favorite products of the law let me know
down below in the comments what you guys
thought and which product was your
favorite and if you guys have ever
purchased any makeup products from
Poundland let me know down below what it
was and whether you got along with it
well obviously this makeup is so
affordable it's only a pound so I did
not expect everything to be amazing but
yeah some of the things were like a hit
some of them are a Miss I feel like
would make up what you pay for is
definitely what you get let me know what
other brand of makeup you guys would
love me to try out next I really want to
do another testing Primark makeup so
