my channel in today's video I am going
to be testing out a makeup brand called
B makeup they are super drugs own makeup
brand you guys might have seen them
before this is kind of what their makeup
looks like I really like their like
minimalistic packaging and I've never
actually tried it this makeup before so
I'm really excited to be trying it for
the first time a really cool thing about
this makeup brand is that they are 100%
vegan and also cruelty free which is
really cool especially seeing as it's a
drugstore brand and it's super
affordable yet the quality is meant to
be amazing so this video is actually in
collaboration with V makeup which I'm
really excited for but as always all my
opinions are my own so do not worry if I
don't like a product I will tell you
guys if you guys enjoy these types of
videos that make sure you smash the huge
thumbs up just down below and also don't
forget to subscribe but without further
adieu well let's get on into the video
okay so the first product we are going
to be putting to the test is this right
here so this is the priming souffle now
when I saw this I had to pick it up
because the consistency is so cool I
absolutely love the consistency of it
it's very like creamy it's basically a
primer in like a mousse format so I'm
really excited to see how this will work
on my skin I love a good primer so let's
just pop that on
kind of like the problematic parts of my
face I like my t-zone where my pores are
a little bit more enlarged I think the
perfect base like a primer is so
important especially for like foundation
application it just makes the whole
thing so much better so I'm just gonna
blend this in with my fingers Wow okay
that is doing a really good job actually
of like concealing all of my paws it's
got like a velvety sort of formula but
it's not sticky in any shape or fall so
it's actually really pleasant to apply
to the skin so that is my primer
complete I'm now gonna move on to a
foundation now after this I'm gonna be
taking this one right here so this is
called the flawless silk foundation so
there's two different types there's a
matte foundation and a silk one but
because I prefer like a dewy sort of
finish I went for this one I just put a
little bit of that foundation onto the
back of my hand and I'm just gonna apply
this all over my face I really like the
fact that be makeup have quite a wide
selection of different foundation shades
so there's bound to be something for
everyone which is really nice and now to
blend in my foundation I'm gonna be
taking one of the BEA makeup sponges
they
we come in a set of four so there's all
these different shapes which is really
cool I have actually already use this
one as you can see it's a little bit
dirty but it's so nice and soft so I'm
just gonna take the thick side and just
start bouncing that foundation into my
skin okay so this foundation is actually
a really good match to my skin and it's
definitely giving me like that dewy
effect which is really nice it's kind of
more like a medium coverage I would say
but I think it would be definitely
really buildable because although I've
applied quite a bit it definitely
doesn't feel like I've applied a lot
it's super lightweight and it doesn't
feel cakey or anything on the skin or
which is always really good so that's
the foundation complete I think it looks
really good it looks super even it's
definitely matched my skin tone so I
haven't got anything bad to say about it
at all now that I move onto concealer so
for this I'm gonna be using it this one
right here this is called the a flawless
duo concealer so it comes up with two
different shades it comes with a lighter
and a darker shade right here
it's a few different shade variations
but obviously I picked out this one to
match my skin tone so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to take the top concealer
and just basically pop that under my
eyes to cover up them dark circles wow
this is actually really nice like it's
super creamy it's covering my dark
circles pretty well as well I have to
say I don't usually go for concealer
that's cream I almost always go for a
liquid concealer instead but this is
super nice it's covering my dark circle
really well it's really creamy
inconsistency and it seems like it's
buildable as well so if you want a more
pigmentation you can definitely kind of
just like keep layering it on without it
looking cakey next up I'm gonna take at
this makeup setting powder this is a
translucent powder which is really good
because it will match all the different
skin tones out there and I'm gonna use a
little bit of this to kind of set my
under eye before it starts creasing and
for this I'm just gonna use this fluffy
could see in the brush from be makeup as
well and what's good about these brushes
is that they are all synthetic so again
they're all vegan and 100% cruelty free
which is absolutely amazing and from
what I can see they are very good
quality like they feel super soft on my
skin so now that my skin is set we can
now move on to you a bit of cream
contour so for this I'm gonna be using
it this little stick right here so this
is called the sculpt and highlight
contour stick if
telling me to take the contour side and
you guys know the drill I'm just gonna
pop this into my cheekbones my nose
temples and a forehead
Oh from what I can feel so far this is
really creamy so I can pretty much tell
I'm not gonna have any problems lending
this out and then gonna take the
highlighter side and just pop a little
bit of that on to the highest point of
my cheekbones and the tip of my nose as
well to blend this out I'm gonna use the
flat contour brush this is such a nice
brush as well I've already used that as
you guys can see and it just literally
blends in the contour so seamlessly I
mean look at that Wow
this product is literally like melting
into my skin I love products like this
where it's like zero effort to actually
blend it in it kind of just does it for
you I mean look at that that is just
blending out so quick like I'm barely
having to do any work at all so that
isn't you my contour blended I'm not
gonna take my fingers and blend in the
highlight I feel like sometimes there's
not a better tool than the warmth of
your fingers this highlight is so pretty
for like everyday like it's not too
blinding it's just like the perfect
amount of shimmer it still looks quite
natural which I obviously love for like
a gnome a coupler the next product I'm
gonna be testing out is another like
contour slash bronzing product I am
really gonna go in with the bronze enos
in this look so this product is called
the Whip's bronzer and this is also in
collaboration with Kasey Lomas which is
a makeup artist and this is what it
looks like it's a very interesting
product it's basically like a mousse but
a mousse bronzer I have never seen
anything like this actually so it's
quite interesting it feels quite light
so I feel like this would be perfect for
like summer there were this product you
meant to pick up the tiniest bear on the
brush like this and literally just very
lightly buff this into the skin as like
a nice bronzer it's not really meant to
be used as contoured I think I think
it's more of like a bronzy sort of color
by okay a little bit definitely goes a
long way with this product I'm actually
super impressed with it it's like a
really nice color it's not too orange E
and it definitely feels super light on
the skin it doesn't feel like I'm
actually applying anything to my skin at
all I think this would be really good
for like those hot summer days when you
just want to wear and
they've make up but not too much okay we
are now going to move on to it some
blusher so for this I have this really
gorgeous pink it's sort of blush so this
one isn't shade it tempt me and it kind
of has like speckles of like glitter but
it's very finely milled it's not like
too chunky or anything which is really
good and I'm gonna take this big powder
brush to kind of just swirl around in
there and then I'm just gonna pop that
onto my cheeks oh my god that is such a
pretty color not gonna lie I thought
this was gonna be a lot more pigmented
than it is but that's not a bad thing at
all like I thought that this was gonna
be super pigmented where I'm gonna have
to like really blend it out but this is
like the perfect amount of pigmentation
for blush for me like as you can see
it's just added like a really nice pinky
hue to my cheek but it still looks super
natural because it's got like slight
shimmer to it I feel like it's added to
my highlight which is making it pop as
ever but now that our skin is complete
we can move on to the eyebrows so for
this I'm gonna be using this brow styler
this isn't shader 0 for blonde and it's
basically one of these like twisty up
triangle sort of pencils I love pencils
like this because they're so easy to use
I use one like this every single day and
it's literally the best thing ever so
I'm just gonna take this and basically
fill in at the beginnings of my brows
because I feel like those parts are the
most sparse oh I am really liking this
like it's a really nice color it's not
too warm it's like kind of cool tone
which I am loving because it's so hard
to come by pencils like this especially
at the drugstore and it's super easy to
apply as well like it's really creamy
then these are the brows finished I
would a hundred percent recommend this
pencil to you guys because it's so easy
to use and it's like the perfect shade
for my brows actually so now we can move
on to the eye makeup now at be makeup
doesn't actually have any eyeshadow
palette available however they do have
at least no pigments which are so cute
and handy because they can obviously be
used as eyeshadows or highlight or
literally whatever you want the first
time I'm gonna take it this shade right
here which is called it's them this is a
very pretty a goldish shimmering color
so I'm gonna tap a little bit of that
into the lid so that we don't make a
complete mess actually you know what
before we applied the pigman I'm
actually gonna go in with the whipped
bronzer and kind of use that as a slight
transition color through the crease
because obviously it's like a really
nice and bronzed color so I
like this will work pretty well on the
eyes as well I absolutely love products
that have a double purposes of course
this is meant for like a bronzer but you
can totally use this as eyeshadow as
well which is really cool because if
you're traveling like me a lot of the
time this is gonna be such a lifesaver
for those of you who don't like to carry
around too many products in your makeup
bag now I'm going to take the gold
pigment from the lid on a flat brush and
just pop that all over the lid basically
this is gonna be a very neutral but like
summery look oh my god this is such a
pretty pigment color and it actually
doesn't have too much fallout which I'm
kind of surprised about because I tend
to sway away from pigments all of the
time because I'm too scared that there's
gonna be a lot of Fallout however with
this one there's actually not too much I
really like this pigment because it is
quite subtle although if you did use
some a setting spray and just kind of
Sprint's that into the formula I think
it would become a lot more pigmented for
those of you who are more into that kind
of thing I'm now going to take the
second pigment that I'm gonna be using
today and this is it it's such a pretty
color this isn't shade at glamoflage
which i think is just such a cool name
it's basically a darker version of the
first pigment it's a lot more bronzy and
we're just going to be using this on the
outer corners today oh my god this is
such a pretty color what I also really
like about these pigments is how
convenient they are because they are so
tiny and cute like you could literally
have a dozens of them and you make a bag
and especially if you're a makeup artist
this will be so good to travel with and
use on different clients so now we can
move on to eyeliner for today's look I'm
gonna be using it this one right here
which is basically a black gel liner and
I'm gonna be creating a slight wing with
this now before we start I do have to
say I'm not the best at applying gel
liner so please bear with me I have to
say this is actually quite easy to use
although I'm not the best at gel liner I
feel like such you're not looking too
bad this is the eye liner finished
although like I said I'm not the best at
applying gel liner I feel like it ended
up looking really good like it does
matter she look that bad in my opinion
and it was quite easy to apply because
the product is super creamy and it's
super black and opaque so I am really
liking this and for the lashes we're
gonna be taking the volumizing mascara
from B make up I quite like the look of
this one because it's quite thin so I
feel
like it's gonna be really good to kind
of get in all the little places where
your lashes are so let's apply a few
coats of that on to the lashes
I think this mascara is actually really
really good because it's making my
lashes super separated but long at the
same time and it looks like I kind of
don't even have mascara on and these are
just my real lashes because the formula
of the mascara is so smooth that it
actually doesn't leave any clumps behind
which is really good so that is my
mascara finished and I'm now gonna move
on to the last part of this makeup which
is the lip now I'm really excited for
this one because I'm gonna be testing
out this gorgeous color of a liquid
lipstick so this is again by Abby makeup
and this isn't shade in the buff so
we're just going to go ahead and apply
this it's got like a little tiny
applicator which is so nice and it looks
like it will be quite precise too this
is such a nice formula so that is the
lipstick on I'm actually gonna apply it
a little bit of another lipstick just to
try it out I really like the color of
this I'm gonna kind of go for like an
ombre sort of effect and this is in the
shade all about me so I'm just gonna pop
that on the very center of the lip that
is such a gorgeous color as well I am a
loving it so this is the finished look
using all @be makeup from superdrug I am
honestly so impressed with how my makeup
looks this is like the perfect kind of
makeup for everyday on like a really
nice warm summer's day it looks so
naturally pretty it doesn't even look
like I'm wearing that much makeup at all
which I really like because it's kind of
like a no makeup makeup look I think my
favorite products from this whole makeup
is definitely like the contour and
highlight to stick I mean look at that
glow it looks so good and I'm definitely
a fan of the whipped bronzer and the
priming souffle I mean I love everything
I've tried to be honest I don't think I
have anything bad to say about any of
these products but yes this is the final
verdict I am definitely approving a B
makeup it is so good it's so affordable
and I just love the fact that it's also
vegan and cruelty free which is another
bonus and that is all from me if you
