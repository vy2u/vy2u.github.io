today I am back with a drugstore makeup
tutorial but this time I'm going to be
testing out a bunch of drugstore
products that I have literally never
tried before I went into super drug and
I bought pretty much a whole face full
of makeup and I've never tried any of
these products before so I'm very
excited to be testing them out for you
guys for the first time on camera and
kind of giving you guys like the first
impression all of the products that I
mentioned in this video are super
affordable so you guys can totally pick
them up yourself and I'll have all of
the prices on the screen as I talk about
them if you guys are brand new here make
sure you guys subscribe to stumble OH
but without further ado let's get on
into the video ok so I have my hefty
super drug bag right here and the first
thing I see in my bag ah some nails now
I have never actually tried like
press-on nails before so this is very
exciting for me but now I'm going to be
testing out today are the impressed
press-on manicure one-step gel nails and
this video is actually very kindly
sponsored by the brand so thank you so
much and I am so excited to be trying
these out I have so many styles and
colors of these nails and literally
don't know which one to try because
there's so many really pretty ones but
because it's winter I'm obviously gonna
have to go for the Christmasy ones
they're so like glittery and just really
pretty
so with these nails you basically can
achieve a won't step gel manicure in
minutes the best thing about these nails
is that they don't actually have glue so
I am literally so bad at applying nails
when they come with glue both these now
so you actually don't need any glue tool
they just have a layer of adhesive on
the actual nail so you just press it on
and you're good to go so inside each of
the boxes there is 30 now 6 accent nails
a prep pad and also a mini file so the
first thing you want to do is just make
sure that your nails are clean and have
no nail polish on them you then want to
choose the correct size of the nails by
just popping them over the now just to
see if they're the correct size you
don't want to do a little bit of filing
with the mini file that comes in the box
if you need to and then you just want to
cleanse the nails with the prep pad next
you just want to peel off the backing
and align it with the cuticle you then
just want to press down firmly on each
of the nails and then also onto the side
I'm gonna apply all of the fingernails
and leave the thumbs to last
so my nails are now finished and I am
totally in love it was so quick and easy
to do and they seemed my broody study on
my nails as well so I don't feel like
they'll ping off anytime soon which is
totally good this so far I give these
nails a big thumbs up now we go to the
face I'm just gonna take off my mascara
that I'm currently wearing and then we
can jump straight into testing out all
of the products ok so I'm back I've
taken off my mascara and my eyebrows but
I've got my foundation and concealer all
finished so we can skip it straight into
contouring bachlin so today I'm gonna be
using at the elf cream contour palette
this I literally have never used or ever
even seen in Superdrug so pretty sure it
might be a new product and here we have
4 different shades they seem pretty a
cool tone which is good obviously we
don't want to have like an orangey kind
of contour so I'm actually going to go
in with the second shade from the
palette which is this one here I'm gonna
take this NYX brush and just go straight
into the palette and then I am going to
kind of try and sculpt my face with this
I'm just applying this in the regular
kind of area of my face just my
cheekbones I'm also gonna blend this up
to my forehead and my temples so far
that is actually looking really good
it's not really going patchy or anything
and it's a really really pretty kind of
bronze color
it feels really creamy on the skin and
it's actually really easy to blend out
so so far I'm actually really liking
this also correct me if I'm wrong but
I'm pretty sure that elf is a new brand
in superdrug while they are in my local
store anyway okay so my contour is not
finished what do you guys think I think
it looks really natural and it was
definitely really easy to blend it
doesn't look patchy or anything it just
looks like a part of my skin so I give
this part
big thumbs up now I'm moving on to blush
I'm gonna be using the nutty London
blush brush blusher and this is in shade
hairy all of these shades are like such
cool names I think they were like one
direction inspired because I have the
other shade of this and it's called
stain so that's totally cool if you guys
like one direction I really really like
this color ice washed on my hand
in superdrug and I was like yes this is
the one so let's see how this looks on
my face oh that is very pigmented guys I
actually forgot how much I liked this
blush I think this is such a pretty
color for like any skin tone for likely
the skin tone for lighter but even
deeper skin tones I think this would
look really pretty on just anyone in
general this was such an affordable
blush as well and the color payoff is so
totally digging that I'm gonna move
right along on to at some liquid
highlighter this I am so excited to try
because I list you didn't even realize
that revolution happening but this is
called it the revolution liquid
highlighter and this is in shade liquid
champagne the priority comes with like a
little pit pet applicator it kind of
reminds me of the iconic highlighters
I'm just going to go right ahead pick
some of that up and just drop it onto my
cheek bone that is gonna be so pigmented
I can already tell literally though can
we just look at that glow oh my god oh
my god it's so pigmented but it's like
not chunky I like the fact that it's not
too glittery and it's actually like a
nice natural looking glow if that makes
any
while I pick it up or my fingers I'm
kind of like dabbing it in I can feel it
bite oily on my fingers I don't know if
that's necessarily a bad thing I think
it's just gonna give it quite a nice
dewy look which I definitely love since
I weigh the bar top and might as well go
to town I might as well go out and just
apply some to my collarbones and also my
shoulder oh my god guys this highlight
is just insane okay I literally have
issues I need to get over this highlight
so moving on to the next product
okay so the next product I'm going to
use is this anyway luxe powder brow
three-in-one brow definer so it comes
with a little spoon on the end so I'm
just gonna brush through my brows oh I'm
getting a bit stuck in my hair there and
then I'm gonna take the other end oh oh
this is interesting
so it's actually got a middle part
that's basically like a brow cushion
sponge thing but then when you put that
back in it's also got a actual pencil
end that's really cool as really
interesting
I'm actually going to use at the end
that's just a pencil because it really
reminds me of my understands it dip brow
no not the brow the brow Wiz I think
it's called and I use this all the time
so Missy if this is any good oh that's a
really good color that's actually like
not too orange and it actually matches
my brow I went for the mid brown color
color payoff is good it's not too like
harder waxy the concentration is real I
don't know if this is just me but
whenever I do my brows I cannot talk
it's the same of eyeliner I think
there's just too much concentration
going on okay so for the brows I
actually really like it it's like it's
pretty much as good as the Anastasia
brow Wiz and
this is like fraction of the price so
I'm very impressed with it I'm gonna be
right along it's your eye shadow because
I'm so excited to use this palette for
the palette I'm gonna be using this bad
boy right here so this is the revolution
life on the dancefloor
guest list palette and wait for it wait
for it
this is literally a palette made for me
like a match made in heaven pretty much
I am loving all these red tone colors at
the moment I just think that's so
gorgeous
perfect for Christmas perfect for like
autumn and winter I'm going to take a
bunch of these eyeshadows that don't
really know what look we'll go for yet
but we'll just make it up as we go okay
so first off I'm gonna take this shadow
right here which is called hip and I'm
gonna use that as a transitional color
I'm just gonna sweep that all through
the crease just to really you know set
the mood set the redness of this look
these shadows a really decent me
pigmented and I just love how many you
get in this palette and the fact that
the mirror is so big as well it's so
good for like traveling so so far I feel
like there's not really any fallout with
this palette like there's not really any
fallout in the actual palette itself
when I pick up the shadows either
haven't it leads me to believe that
these shadows in itself are quite creamy
regardless of what brush you use the
pigmentation on this palette you guys is
like whoa like look at that and then
just gonna go in with that same red
shadow just underneath and my lower lash
line as well I find beyond impressed
with this palette like this is perfect
for like holidays
just in general like if you like these
kind of colors this palette is
definitely for you and I feel like it's
such a good dupe for like the morphe
palette locks I feel like the colors are
also really dread toned literally this
whole I love no fall out at all so I
feel like that speaks for itself and
it's only ten pounds I'm now gonna go in
with
collection of felt tip liner this is the
extreme 24-hour felt tip liner I don't
think I've ever use this maybe I have
but I don't remember but it's just a
very simple black felt tip liner bottom
line is like this tend to dry out really
quickly sometimes so we shall see how
pigmented it is oh my god this is
actually really pigmented though
eyeliner is def in the a thumbs up it's
so pigmented and really easy to use like
I was able to achieve this really like
bold a winged liner in probably like two
minutes or a minute and I really really
like it it's very pigmented really
opaque so that's definitely really kind
of hard to come by in a felt tip liner
and is very precise as well so I
definitely give it a thumbs up we can
now move on to some mascara so for this
I'm going to be using the eye defined
and nourish and Candace Cara from anyway
again this was very inexpensive and
apparently this has avocado oil inside
it so that's very good for your lashes
my face is so far I felt like this
mascara would really give me lots of
volume but it's not really distributing
as much product onto the lashes as I
would have liked it to I guess it's time
to preference but I kind of like having
that almost slightly clumpy look to the
lashes I'm not ridiculously company but
just a little bit just enough to kind of
give that volume to the lashes and
really coat them well there so far I'm
not really getting that from this one so
that's not disappointing but I guess
it's like you know you just kind of have
to shop around and really pick your own
mascara that suits you well from the
drugstore mascara may not really be
working for me but that's not to say
it's not gonna work for someone else
okay so lashes are now done I don't
think they load because their absolute
best but at the same time they're not
the worst I don't know I just feel like
this is at my least favorite product
that I've tried today so for that reason
I think I'm gonna give it a thumbs down
now lastly for the left
I'm so excited to try this it's another
revolution at makeup products and this
is the retro luxe matte lip kit I went
for the shade noble which looks like
this
and I basically picked that because I
really like that kind of color it's like
a brown nude sort of color so it comes
with a lip liner in the lip kit which is
totally like Kylie Jenner's but I'm
gonna line my lips with this bus so the
lip liner was very easy to apply the
formula is actually very creamy and
similar to the Kylie lip kit formula and
I'm now just going to go in with the
liquid lipstick and just apply that all
over my lips so I'm totally digging the
lip account I really like the color it
feels very soft on the lips it always
feels like I'm not really wearing
anything on my lips it's not like sticky
like the most liquid lipsticks are and
so far it doesn't feel like it's too
drying either so it's very comfortable
to wear again the lip kit was very
affordable so I feel like it definitely
deserves a big thumbs up so and that is
all of the makeup that I'm gonna try out
with these today I feel like this video
was a really big success there was only
one product that I didn't really like
but apart from that all of the products
that I tested out for the first time
that were really good I feel like
drugstore makeup was definitely stepped
up their game lately it's just so good
and affordable that you don't even need
to buy any high-end makeup never know
