how's it going so today I have a very
exciting video because I'm actually
going to be testing out a foundation
that I bought from eBay where is it I
lost it
where'd I put it okay you got it so I
got the foundation on eBay and this is
meant to be like world's most coverage
foundations that's a lot people on
YouTube have been saying a lot about
this before we don't show you this video
if you guys haven't subscribed already
please do come and join the dinosaur
family and also don't forget to enter my
two million and giveaway which is
absolutely insane if you guys haven't
seen it yet I'll link it down below you
guys have to check it out and you have
to enter there's only like two ish weeks
left I'm going to be announcing the
winners over on my vlog channel on the
26th of July so make sure you guys
autism spoke to my daily blogging
channel also click the little
notification button down below to get
notified every time I post a video but
without further ado let's get on into
the video so the packaging that just
looks like this it doesn't really look
like anything promising like the
packaging itself doesn't say I'm the
world's most coverage foundation does it
no but we're not going to judge the book
by its cover we're going to see what the
contents inside a light I don't feel
like a light medium kind of shade
because I'm quite hand at the moment but
from what I remember when our buying
this and wasn't really that minimum make
sure you like do your research and you
know like color match your skin to the
image I guess like I have no idea how
you meant to do that so this could be
the worst shade for me but we will see
so this is the little and it also has
SPF starts you know which is very good
especially if you're like in a hot
country even if you're not just you know
the foundation that has SPF is always
good okay so I just popped a tiny bit of
the foundation onto my hand and I'm just
gonna rub it in whoa that feels so heavy
I have no idea if this is going to be
like good for my skin but literally as
I'm applying this onto my hand it's like
completely cancelling out any tones of
my actual skin tone I feel like there's
gonna be an okay match though so I think
I did a pretty good job
it feels very creamy but at the same
time is very heavy
also like a little bit like stickier
feels in a tiny bit sticky it doesn't
actually smell of anything it just
smells like like a regular termination
would really okay so now that I've
forced us on my hand I think I want to
rub it all over my face so I'm going to
do it like a side by side kind of
comparison I could before and after if I
may I'm just going to apply this to at
my right side of my face okay the weave
is going up just kidding I don't have a
weave okay so now that I've got it at
the foundation of all over one side of
my face I'm going to blend it in with
this little iconic London brush for my
foundation and we'll see how it looks I
am kind of nervous for this okay so this
is what the foundation it looks like I
look really crazy right now but look at
that what the hell this is literally the
most flawless my skin has ever looked
like I have to say just look at that any
discoloration on any blemishes gone my
under-eye charcoal is gone without
concealer like whoa can we just talk
about that I know it may look a little
bit like greasy but we're going to tone
it down with some banana powder I'm
going to be all good to go
okay so I've set it in place now and
although it still looks a little bit
like shiny here and kind of like on my
forehead I don't think it's anything
like a really bad I think it just makes
my skin still looks like skin because
obviously you're going to have those
areas on your face where your skin looks
a little bit more oily and shiny which I
think that actually adds to it looking
more natural because I thought that when
I apply this foundation is that you're
going to look like airbrushed plastic on
my face but it does not at all it still
looks like my skin I can still see my
pores
I'm sure I am sugar to the core no you
guys may be like I don't really see a
difference because you don't really have
many spots and I know that my skin is
actually quite clear and I'm very lucky
to have that but I still have
discoloration just like anyone else and
if you look at this side of my face you
can clearly see that okay so now I'm
going to move on to like how it actually
feels on my skin so really know how to
describe it it just feels like a normal
foundation it doesn't feel like anything
different really one thing I can notice
is the fact that I have quite prominent
like smile lines I smile a lot like this
and I can see that the foundation is
already kind of like settling a bit in
that area this should be easily
preventable though if you just put you
know a heck load of powder in that I
would say if I could deal-breaker for me
but it's just definitely something I've
noticed with this foundation I also
really like the fact that it oxidizes
into my skin when I first applied it
kind of looked a bit pinky and not
really my skintone but now when you look
at my forehead you really can't see the
difference like you can't see the
difference in color at all I am
thoroughly impressed with this you guys
you guys okay I'm going to do the other
side of my face now because we've got a
completeness look you know I have to say
when I first apply it it does really
look like I've just got like a mask on
and my skin is melting off and this is
the complete foundation look so I've
just set everything in place with it
some vanilla powder and I think it looks
amazing like you look so good now I know
what like a celebrity views like
celebrities probably used foundations
just like this if they go on the red
carpet because there is no way people
have like clear skin like this without
this kind of foundation I would say for
someone like me who already has quite
good skin it's not really that great
because you don't want to keep locking
up your pores like you can definitely
wear something a little bit more less
coverage and I definitely don't really
need this much coverage but I think this
would be absolutely amazing for someone
who is struggling with a lot of
blemishes
acne that kind of thing a lot of
discoloration this would literally save
your life like seriously okay so that is
the end of my little review of this
foundation
and I have no words seriously like I did
not expect this foundation to be this
good because it's an eBay foundation
like an Amazon foundation like those
kinds of things never usually work so
the fact this actually is a good product
is insane let me know down below what
you guys think of this foundation if you
guys think it looks natural or if it
looks a little bit too like heavy I
