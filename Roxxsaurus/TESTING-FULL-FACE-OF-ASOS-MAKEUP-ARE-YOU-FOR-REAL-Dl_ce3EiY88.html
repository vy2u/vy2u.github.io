testing out some ASOS makeup now I
literally have a full face of Asus
makeup that I've ordered online and the
only thing I wasn't actually able to get
with foundation because they don't
actually sell foundation or concealer
don't be testing out the products
together to see whether we like them I
own esteem really have high hopes
because a source is amazing at clothes
like that is their Forte they were
clothing a brand but when they released
the products a few months ago I was kind
of skeptical didn't really know whether
I wanted to try them but today has come
I am gonna be trying them for you guys
on camera and I'm really excited if you
guys are brand new if you haven't seen
my face before make sure you guys
subscribe and also hit the bell button
down below to stay notified and every
time I post a new video but that's a
renew let's get on into the video okay
so all of the April's products have
basically come in these little black
bubble wrap envelopes so everything is
packaged very securely I actually got
this Next Day Delivery as well next day
to live real nice is like the best thing
ever
so the first thing I'm going to use is
the bronzer this is what it looks like I
absolutely love the packaging I think is
so cute and it's bright pink so can't
really go wrong I sure wasn't able to
find a like a contour kit or anything on
the website so that is why I'm going for
a powder bronzer now looking at this
it's got my curse light shimmer to it
not too much but just the tiny tiny bit
so it's not completely matte now I'm
kind of skeptical whether I'm gonna like
this already because I only like very
matte and flat bronzers because I feel
like they're you look the most natural
on the skin so let's just let's just dig
into this bad boy and that's my
pigmented on the brush actually here it
guys I like that you know that is
actually a really nice color like it's
quite subtle it's not to oranjee it's
quite cool toned which is definitely a
winner in my books in terms of the
slight shimmer to the bronzer when I
actually apply it to my skin
is coming up I can't see any shimmer me
the tiniest bit it's nothing major so I
definitely don't mind it which is a good
start
okay so for the bronzer I think I give
this probably like six out of ten it's
okay it's not like the best bronze I use
I kind of feel like it's giving me quite
a muddy look I'm now going to take a
blusher this is in shade acceptance and
this is such a beautiful color look at
that guys so I'm just gonna pick some of
that up on my Real Techniques brush and
just apply it to all oh okay that is
very pigmented okay trying to blend this
out actually blends out quite well so
it's not a problem I did not think this
would be so pigmented but it is which is
good see I only need the tiniest there
and it goes a very long way I am really
liking the blush I feel like it gives my
skin like a very nice healthy flush of
color to the skin it's not like powdery
it's really highly pigmented so you only
need the tiniest bit but it blends out
really well so it can't really fault out
I think I'll give this like a 9 out of
10 and the last skin related product we
have is a highlighter stick and this is
what it looks like I think it's really
cool it's just got the same like I kind
of logo on it and the color is so pretty
it's like that perfect champagne golden
sort of color I'm just gonna apply that
to at the highest point of my cheek Wow
okay I am digging this so far oh my god
this is so nice do you guys see that
that is such a pretty natural looking
glow like I feel like the color makes it
look really natural and not like I've
got like a bunch of highlighter on my
face this is so nice and it's so
pigmented too I'm actually really liking
it the actual formula of this product is
really nice it's not like too greasy
it's very creamy so it's really easy to
apply to the skin and then blend it out
I am really liking this I'm gonna give
this a 10 out of 10 I'm now gonna move
on to my brows now as she wasn't able to
find a brow product on the website so I
just picked up the eyeshadow pallete I'm
also gonna be using for my eyes this is
the a devoted eyeshadow palette so it
has a bunch of really nice and neutral
shades as you can see so I'm just going
to be taking this matte Brown shadow to
a try and attempt to fill my brows with
that I have no idea if it's gonna be my
shade but we're just gonna go with that
I do feel like I actually made a mistake
with this I should have just used a
normal bread product because this shadow
although it's like really nice and it
kind of does match my eyebrows it's very
warm toned so it's gonna kind of leave
my brows looking a little bit ginger
okay so the browser dad they're not the
worst but they're also not the best
we're just gonna roll with them I'm just
gonna skip ahead now and move it to the
eyes I'm gonna be using a mixture of all
these shadows really just to kind of get
a feel of what they're like within the
creamy weather there's a lot of fallout
in fact whilst I was using this brown
shadow for my brows I felt like there
wasn't really much fallout their actual
eyeshadow application was very smooth
and creamy so it's looking quite
promising right now so the first time
I'm going to be taking is the lightest
shade of the whole palette I'm going to
just use that as like a nice all-over
kind of color to set that down so that
all the eyeshadows can kind of blend
into that so I'm just gonna pick that up
on a fluffy brush and just kind of brush
that all over that is actually quite
nicely pigmented I didn't expect that
but it's actually quite impressive I'm
now gonna take the slightly darker like
topi sort of shade and just pop that
through the crease as a little bit of
definition right there yeah this shadow
isn't really the most pigmented chatter
I've ever used but it's perfect for like
your everyday sort of subtle look and
it's definitely really great as a slight
transition color and then going to take
the slightly pinky shadow which is this
one here and just run that through the
crease again yes
I'm liking that color actually that is a
lot more pigmented than the brown one I
feel like this palette is definitely
perfect for like an everyday sort of
look where you don't really need super
super intense pigmentation but you
definitely want enough pigmentation to
actually be able to see it and for it to
show up on the skin but by no means is
this palette going to be intense so
that's the kind of thing you're looking
for I probably wouldn't recommend this
palette and now I'm going to take the
darker Brown show that we previously
used for our brows and I'm just going to
pop that into at the very outer corner
just to kind of add a sense of a slight
smokey eye but we do want this to be
quite natural I'm just gonna be creating
like an everyday sort of look so nothing
too crazy this is sort of the look that
I kind of tend to go for for everyday I
never really apply too much eyeshadow
I'm also gonna take that Brown
underneath the lower lash line
slow slightly as well now lastly for the
eyes I'm gonna be taking at the slightly
shimmery shadow this is actually the
only shimmery shadow from this whole
palette so I'm just going to take that
on a small pointed brush and just apply
that into my inner corners I always like
to do this for my everyday sort of look
because I feel like this opens up the
eyes so much more and makes me look so
much more awake I'm also gonna take that
up to the brow bone and highlight those
areas as well and then also gonna just
pop my finger into the eyeshadow palette
and just pop that ever so slightly onto
the center of my lid just to add a
slight shimmer and add a pop of color
right there okay so that is the
eyeshadow finished my thoughts on the
palette is that it's definitely really
great for people who are like beginners
to makeup who don't really like such
pigmented shadows on their lids for
every day it's just like the perfect
little everyday sort of pallor
I feel like this palette would be
perfect for younger people because it
means you can't make any mistakes
they're very easy to blend out these
shadows and also they're not too
pigmented which kind of means that you
can never go overboard with eyeshadow so
this will definitely be really great for
school especially if your school doesn't
really allow you to wear makeup okay now
let's move on to the eyeliner this is
literally my favorite part of any
testing video so I have got my hands on
the liquid liner from a sauce it just
looks like this the packaging is really
nice like it's very cohesive throughout
the whole brand so I really like that
it's a fat tip line as you can see so
it's very very pointed I'm gonna see how
black it is as well because I feel like
hmmm I'm not really too sure how black
this is gonna be but we will see I'm
just gonna go in with this and create my
very typical sort of everyday winged
liner
so what I is done I am loving this
eyeliner honestly it's actually really
easy to use I didn't think it would be
but the tip is very stiff even though
it's really long as you can see it's
very stiff so you can really get that
precise liner without it kind of like
bubbling around or anything
the liner is that's really pigmented and
super black as you can see so I'm really
rating this eyeliner so far up I'm just
doing my second wing and I have come
across one thing that I don't really
like about it and that's basically the
fact that it's already kind of drying
out as I'm trying to do the second
weirder be warned if you're getting this
eyeliner it's probably gonna dry out
within like a week even though it's
really precise and really pigmented the
first time you use it it's now kind of
becoming quite dry on the second eye so
I'm just gonna try my best ok so my
thoughts on the eyeliner has done a
total 360 I cannot be dealing with a
flaky eyeliner who doesn't show up to
the party I mean look for that second
eye that is probably the worst eyeliner
I have ever achieved and that is only
because the product had dried out after
one use like come on you can't do that
to me I was really liking the product as
well I think it was very precise it was
very black and matte and free liked it
I've really wanted to like it until this
happened so definitely don't recommend
the eyeliner but we're now going to test
out the mascara this isn't going to be a
very thick mascara wand I can tell you
yes it is it's a synthetic mascara wand
imagine just gonna curl my lashes first
just to help them a little bit you know
my lashes are literally the straightest
lashes in the world so they definitely
need a helping hand okay so I'm gonna
take the mascara now and just apply a
few coats of this onto my lashes
hmm okay uh stop bad actually it's
making them super super black and
they're staying quite separated which is
good it's not really giving them too
much of volume and is definitely giving
them quite a bit of length which are
massive really impressed with I was just
kind of under the impression that
because the wand is so thick I thought
that it was gonna give me a really
amazing volume but it hasn't really done
that but I'm not really complaining it's
given me the length so that's all that
matters
and lastly I'm gonna move on to the lips
so for the lip I had the lip pencil in
shade sorted it looks like this it's
like my typical kind of dark nude sort
of left it applies really nicely
actually fund it reminds me of the Kylie
lip kit kind of lip liners it glides
onto the lips which I'm really liking
though I've lined my lips I really like
the way and the lip liner applied it was
super smooth application it's really
creamy I have no idea if this is going
to match the lipstick that I got so a
sauce liquid lipstick I have here is in
shade immersed it's a lot darker than
the lip liner so I'm just gonna go over
the lip liner and hope for the best
oh my god that color is so nice this
literally looks like coke okay okay so
I've got to say I'm really diggin the
liquid lipstick it's such a nice color
it dries super matte it's kind of making
my lips look really really dry you guys
see that but I'm really diggin the color
like it literally looks like coke okay
and all candy cane no I think is coke
okay bye Kylie lip kits such a pretty
color this is very pigmented initially
applied with one coat so I'm very
impressed by the lipstick and the lip
liner I think I'd give them like and
nine out of ten so that is if my testing
Asus makeup I am so impressed with some
of these bits I kind of love the
highlight I really like the lips I feel
like the lipstick is definitely one of
my favorite things from everything I've
test
today let me know your thoughts on the
Asus make up would you ever buy them
this is the total that the whole
purchases came up to now in quite pricey
for a sauce like you could get cheaper
makeup from the drugstore even though
I'd like some of these pieces I do think
that you can definitely get better
things from the drugstore instead of a
source makeup I probably would just go
to the drugstore to be honest you have
so much more choice so yes do you let me
know what you guys think of this makeup
I think I actually really like I don't
really see too much difference from my
typical products that I use but the
eyeliner was just a nightmare the fact
that it dried out and I literally
couldn't finish this eye properly that
was not good
let me know what other brands of makeup
you would like me to test out I actually
want to do another like panel on testing
make up I've done one in the past but I
really want to do another one because
I'm sure there's like some new pieces
and maybe even Primark so let me know
which one you would like to see first a
pan land or Primark a makeup testing
I'll have a little poll in the corner
there that is all from me thank you so
much for watching I really hope to see
you guys in my next video and I hope
you're all having a wonderful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
