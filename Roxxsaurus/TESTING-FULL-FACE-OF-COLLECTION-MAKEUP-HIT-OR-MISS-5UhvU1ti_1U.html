today I have a quite an exciting video
because I'm gonna be doing another like
one branded testing makeup sort of
videos and as you can tell by the title
today I'm gonna be testing out
collection makeup those of you who don't
know what collection makeup is I'm not
too sure if it's in like every country
or if it's just in the UK it's basically
like a drugstore makeup brand that you
have in my boots or super dry everything
is super affordable and I've actually
never tried many of their products
before though I thought this would be a
really good video idea to kind of test
out a full face of their makeup and that
you guys know what the deal is if you
guys enjoyed these types of videos make
sure you smash their he's thumbs up just
down below and also subscribe if you
haven't already because I would love to
have you here come and join the dinosaur
family but anyways without further I'm
billing it let's get on into the video
okay so to start off the video I'm gonna
get my trusty Minnie Mouse a headband
this is actually from Primark so I'm
just gonna pop that on to get my hair
out of my face so the first product from
collection that I'm gonna be trying out
is this primer which is called the
primed and ready collection primer it
looks like this this was a super super
affordable so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of that onto my hand and just
basically rub that into my face we've
really rubbed that perfect like flawless
complexion so it's always good to use a
primer underneath your foundation Wow
okay this probe is actually really good
it's really mattifying my pores which i
don't know if you guys like that color
but I actually really like when my skin
looks kind of matte just because I have
quite an oily skin naturally so whenever
I put something mattifying onto my pores
it just makes them look so much nicer
and my foundation always lasts so much
longer throughout the day so your skin
is primed I would say that that's quite
a good primer haven't really got
anything bad to say about it next up
we're gonna move on to foundation so
that one of the reason today is the
lasting perfection collection ultimate
wear foundation this apparently has up
to 16 hours of wear and it's oil-free
with SPF 20 so this cost me a $5.99 at
superdrug so I feel like that's quite a
good price for the foundation I woah
okay I did not expect that okay
so I let's just open this expecting it
be a pump but it's like
stick so it's just gone everywhere oh my
god it's like losing out the sides can
you see that oh no it's got on my cheese
right let's just wipe that off I had to
try again so the reason why I picked up
this foundation is because I've been
seeing so many people rave about the
perfection concealer which I'll also be
using in this video I've never used
either of them so I have no idea what
they're gonna be like but I've heard
amazing things so I'm really excited
okay so I'm just gonna take the
foundation this isn't shade cool beige
it's kind of just dripping all down the
stick so I'm really scared is gonna trip
on my clothes right let's just apply it
onto the face I'm really hoping this is
gonna be my shade it looks kind of dark
Oh No
ah shoot I haven't got it brush it it
was so unorganized for this video so if
you're wondering what brushes are
beating for this video I'm just using
the zoeva prime set so these all are
vegan which is so good so I'm just gonna
be taking this a weaver buffer brush and
just buffing that foundation into my
skin there is nothing better than a new
set of brushes I'm telling you guys why
impress at this foundation so far it
blends very really easily it's kind of
giving me a bit of like a jewy a fact or
do we should I say I never know how to
say that word is it jewy or is it dewy
who knows I am really liking this
foundation it blended in literally
seamlessly into the skin it's covered up
all my imperfections so I give it a
thumbs up although I have to say it
looks a little bit I don't know is it
too dark for me I can't really tell
unlike the viewfinder but it just kind
of looks a little bit too orange but I
mean that's probably just cuz I'm really
power at the moment and it is good so
next up I'm gonna take the lasting
perfection collection concealer this is
in shade a fair now this cost me four
pound 19 which is kind of a weird
project I've heard amazing things about
this so I'm just gonna apply that
underneath my eyes oh it feels really
creamy not bad guys not bad
I'm just gonna take this concealer brush
and just kind of buff that away into the
skin oh my god I am actually shook how
well this blended out
and it's covered my under-eye circles so
well wow now I can understand why
everyone was raving about this for like
ages and I can't believe I hadn't tried
it until this point that's literally
insane
imagine gonna skip powder today because
I want to maintain that like dewy effect
to my skin and I'm gonna move straight
into contour so I'm gonna be using at
this highlight blush and bronze palette
from collection as well this cost me
$4.99 of boots I'm actually only gonna
be taking the bronzing shade from this
palette because I already have a
highlight and a blusher I also want to
try out separately from this I'm kind of
worried because this does look a little
bit too orange for my liking you guys
know I love my like cool toned bronzers
so I'm just going to go straight into
the cheekbone hmm not much is really
showing up let me pick up a little bit
more okay there it is there it is we get
in there guys I felt like this bronzed
look was gonna be a little bit too warm
and don't get me wrong
it still is a tad bit too warm for my
liking I definitely prefer much more
cooler toned bronzers flash contour
products but it's not the worst like
I've definitely tried at worst bronzers
nurse
I feel like this palette has like a
mid-range sort of pigmentation palette
would definitely be really good for
people who are just starting out and
makeup cuz it's not like you can really
go overboard with the contour with this
now moving on to blush we're gonna be
taking at this single collection blusher
this is the soft glow blusher and this
isn't shade three cheeky and I love the
color of this it's so like nice and
fresh and peachy so I'm just gonna take
a big fluffy brush like this and just
tap that into the product and then we're
gonna go it straight into the apples of
our cheeks oh that's really pretty
actually yes I am liking this absolutely
I love in this little blusher is so
pretty in color and it's so pigmented as
well the tiniest bit goes a long way so
you guys don't need to pick up one of
these cuz it's so nice now moving on to
the highlight my favorite part of every
testing video I'm gonna be taking the
collection speedy highlighter this is
basically just like a chubby highlighter
stick it's such a pretty color inside I
haven't even washed it yet
and I'm really really excited to put out
my face so let's just dab it onto the
cheekbone oh yes that is so nice do you
guys see that oh my god this is
literally the easiest highlighter
application I have ever tried I love
these little sticks like they're just so
easy to just like chuck into your
handbag and you're good to go you can
definitely build this product up and
just get that really blinding effect but
I feel like it looks really pretty when
it's like subtle and it kind of looks
like part of the skin so now that the
skin is completely finished we can move
on to the brows so for this I'm gonna be
using the collection instant brow pomade
this is waterproof and long-lasting so
I'm really hoping it this is gonna be my
shade color in the pot looks quite
promising it doesn't look too orange
which is another thing that I really
dislike when it comes to like skin and
brow products when the products too
orange
it just don't look good okay so I feel
like this isn't as pigmented as I
thought it might be it kind of supplies
but it's quite waxy just it only cost
399 but I feel like if you're gonna pick
up any brow product from collection it
should probably be the little like
pencil because I feel like that's gonna
be a lot better than this I really like
the color either I feel like it's a
little bit too light for my brows like
you can see where I filled it in and it
just doesn't really look that good but
at the same time I feel like the darker
shade would have been too dark for my
brows so those are the complete brows I
have to say they still turned out pretty
okay they're not the best but they're
also not the worst the products is
definitely workable but it just takes a
little bit patience and a little bit of
time to really build up the pigment so
now moving on to eyeshadow I have two
different palettes we're gonna be trying
out today so the first one is the
collection eyes uncovered in nude rose
and then the second one is the matte
nude rose so we're kind of going to be
using the both of them to try and create
a look so first up I'm gonna start with
the matte palette and I'm gonna be
taking this brown shade from and this
palette to kind of pop that into the
crease and use as a transition color
okay so so far that brown shadow
literally has done nothing I mean can
you guys see any eye shadow on my lids
cuz when I'm looking up close there is
no shadow to be detected I'm gonna try
at the darkest shadow which is this one
here and maybe that will show up a
little bit better this shadow palette is
not like mind-blowing again it's quite
subtle maybe this would be really good
for beginners but as like a makeup lover
I just expect something something
special from an eyeshadow palette I
would say this is a little bit too
subtle it's kind of on the verge of not
showing up on my lids at all I'm gonna
take the more peachy shadow now and try
and pop that through the crease as well
just to see what kind of pigmentation
we'll get with that okay so I feel like
I'm starting to sort of get somewhere
I'm trying to build up the pigmentation
of the colors but it definitely takes
quite a few layers to trying you know
get it to get there I'm now gonna take
the darkest shadow from the same palette
and just kind of pop that on at the
outer corners to deepen up the look a
little bit I have to say out of all the
eyeshadow palettes I have ever tried on
this channel in like testing videos this
is probably the one I'm most unimpressed
with it obviously no disrespect to
collection because they do some really
amazing products but this eyeshadow
palette just isn't really for me okay so
let's just say with this look I'm going
for a really natural smoky eye because
that's literally the only thing I can
really achieve with that palette I'm now
gonna take the new dros palette and just
kind of hope that these shadows will
kind of jazz up the look a little bit
because it's kind of lacking I'm gonna
use my finger to do this actually so I
can see how they apply with just fingers
okay so that just definitely proved my
theory using my finger definitely gives
a more pigmented look so I'm just gonna
apply a little bit more my finger onto
the other eye I'm now gonna take the
darkest shadow from this palette on my
finger oh that looks quite promising I'm
just gonna try and pop that on the outer
crease okay there's a lot of fallout but
it is working it is definitely a lot
more pigmented with my finger I'm gonna
try and blend out the edges with a brush
for a little bit more precision I'm also
gonna take that dark plum color and it
just pop that on my lower lash line
as well at the end of the day we did
manage to achieve a quite a nice look
and I felt like these shadows are just a
little bit more wearable and toned down
for every day I'm gonna move on to the
eyeliner now for this I'm gonna be using
this one right here which I've actually
used quite a bit in the past and I
really really like this this is the
collection of fast stroke eyeliner
pretty sure I actually included this as
one of my dupes for a high-end wire sow
eyeliner in my dupes versus like
high-end makeup video if you guys
haven't seen that yet click the little
eye up there to check it out but today
I'm gonna be creating like a winged
liner I'm telling you guys this now cuz
I literally cannot talk whilst I'm doing
my eyeliner there is just way too much
concentration involved literally gonna
hold my breath for the next two minutes
and for mascara today I'm gonna be using
at the collection of volume max
waterproof mascara so this one's
actually really interesting cuz it's got
a primer and as well as the mascara and
the first type I'm gonna take the primer
and and see what that's like and trying
to apply this from my lashes but I feel
like nothing's really coming off okay I
guess my lashes are primed although I
feel like there's nothing actually on
them right now and then I'm gonna take
at the mascara and oh I quite like that
wand I'm really hoping this is gonna
give me some good lashes so I feel like
the formula of this mascara is kind of
dry I'm not sure if you guys are gonna
understand what I'm trying to say with
this but I feel like a lot of the scars
have like a really dry formula when
you're actually trying to apply it
there's not that much coming off of the
wand I don't really like formulas like
that I prefer when my mascaras are quite
watery in consistency so they actually
apply to the lashes okay so now that the
eyes are completely finished I'm now
gonna move on to the lips now the first
thing I'm gonna use is this lip primer
so this is the primed and ready lip
primer by collection it's just like a
lip balm I guess so
I'm gonna apply this to my lips first
because we are gonna be using a matte
liquid lipstick today but if something's
so dry and cracked or recently it's
ridiculous if you guys know any really
good like lip balm or lip treatments
that you guys have been loving recently
let me know in the comments cuz you
gonna need some help okay so now to line
my lips I'm gonna be using this lip
liner right here which is the collection
lip definer in shade a nude pink this
cost me - 79 which is a really good
price for a lip liner it has a very
pointed end and it's like one of those a
retractable ones oh my god is so creamy
absolutely loving this lip liner it was
so full and it's really pigmented it's
super smooth so I'm really really liking
that and now lastly for the lipstick I'm
gonna be taking at the collection velvet
kiss moisturizing lip cream this one is
in shade caramel - which is such a
pretty color oh my god this smells
incredible it smells like the Kylie lip
kits would smell like vanilla okay guys
so this is the finished look I mean I am
loving the lip line the lip and the
highlight is definitely my favorite part
of this whole video this lip color is so
beautiful it feels so moisturizing on
the lips
no it's like a matte lipcream what do
you guys think of this look I honestly
feel like we managed to achieve a pretty
like wearable everyday sort of look
we've literally so many affordable
products out of everything I think the
only product I probably wouldn't
recommend is the eyeshadow because
although it did manage to look quite
good in the end I just had a little bit
of a struggle with it and it was kind of
annoying to have to build up so many
layers of each eyeshadow to like really
get it to be pigmented with that being
said it's definitely really affordable
so I feel like you want to try it out it
might work for you even though it didn't
really work for me definitely do let me
know in the comments what your favorite
product was out of this video if you
have tried any collection products in
the past and what you thought of them
and as always I would love for you guys
to recommend any other like makeup
brands you'd like me to try out or if
there's any like weird beauty products
that you have seen recently definitely
let me know in the comment but yeah that
is all for this video I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and I hope to see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
