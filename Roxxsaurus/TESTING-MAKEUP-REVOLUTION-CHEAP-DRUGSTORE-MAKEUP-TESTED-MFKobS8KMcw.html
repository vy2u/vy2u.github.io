Channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far so today we're really
excited because I'm going to be doing
yet another testing and make up like a
one-round makeup kind of video and today
I'm going to be testing out makeup
revolution which is actually a brand
that I have kind of tried out like a few
products of but I haven't ever done like
a full face of this makeup brand and I'm
really excited so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you guys enjoy
these types of videos makes me mash that
huge thumbs upses down below and also
subscribe if you haven't already cuz I
would love to have you here come and
join the dinosaur family but without
further ado let's get into the video
okay so the first products I'm going to
try for makeup revolution is this one
here and this is the revolution Pro HD
contouring palette and I have actually
realized that makeup revolution don't
actually do foundations but that is why
I'm starting off this video with my
foundation already done and under going
to skip straight into contouring oh this
is the first time I have ever used any
kind of contouring products from makeup
revolution I've tried highlighted before
which I do really like the highlighter
this is the palette right here it has a
fair bit of different shades for
different skin tones and it also seems
that it's got like a color correcting
color as well as a highlight which is
also really good so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
Brown middle color for contouring I feel
like this will be quite a good shade for
me I also really love it that this
palette is like cool tone rather than
warm tones because the contouring is all
about the cool tone shades which make it
look so much more natural and I'm just
going to pop this into my kind of hollow
of my cheek as I usually do that is such
a nice color you guys oh my gosh and
it's for pigmented so far it's seeming
to blend into the skin really easily
which I love about cream contour
products and the color is just so pretty
it looks so natural so yeah huge props
to the kind of contouring shade but also
cute props to the brush that I'm using
this brush is from
and it's in 23 it doesn't actually have
a name so it's just a number but it's
actually a really good contour brush I
feel like this looks so natural and I
love it but I'm going to also take the
slightly darker color and see how that
looks on my skin tone and just kind of
go a little bit into here and define
that kind of hollow part of my cheek
even more about learning going to take
the tiniest bit of this because I don't
want it to be too harsh on the skin and
I'm just going to pop that in to the
whole of my cheek again
oh no if I already said and button just
palate with 8 pounds which I feel like
is an okay reasonable kind of price for
the amount of products that you get in
here I mean you get all kinds of
different shades as well as highlighting
colors which I'm really really excited
to try though now the highlight I'm
going to be taking this white
pearlescent kind of color that is such a
pretty color I'm so excited I can't
really see much I'm going to try and
pick this up on a slightly different
brush were they so pretty oh my gosh
I have to say this is more of like a
strobe effect rather than a highlight so
I am going to set this in place with
another highlight and the one I'm going
to be using is the pro illuminate this
is such a big pan look how big that is
compared to my face like that is pretty
much like half the size of my face which
is such a big pan and I feel like you
literally won't run out of this for
years and this is such a pretty color
it's like kind of like a golden
champagne e
nude kind of color I'm not really great
at explaining things but I love this so
much so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to swish my big brush around in
this ah those so satisfying when you've
got like a huge pan to like put your
brush into and I'm now going to just
apply this to my cheek just to set that
other highlight in place like how the
lining that is oh my goodness I'm
allowed I don't actually remember how
much this product was but I'm pretty
sure it was around my
five pounds I will have the exact price
down below but oh my god whatever the
price was I feel like it's totally worth
it because look how pretty that glow is
and also with the amount of product to
get in here you're never going to run
out so now that we are finished with the
skin that we can now move on to the eyes
and I have purchased this palette here
to try out today for the eye makeup and
this is called the ultra eye contour
light and shade palette this is I'm
pretty sure the palette that everyone
said is a complete ripoff of Calphalon
Dee's shade and light palette I'm pretty
sure and even like the layout is so
similar the shades are pretty much
identical so yeah there was a huge
outrage about this I pretty sure on her
Instagram so yeah let's just see if this
is any good what I love about this
palette so much is the fact that every
single eyeshadow is matte and yeah matte
eyeshadows are just so easy to work with
they're like my favorite to apply to my
eyes because they look the most natural
disease free I've given this little
brush in the palette I'm achieving a
attempt to use this and see if it's like
any good to use and I will let you guys
know
so the first eyeshadow I'm going to use
is this one here which is kind of like a
neutral skintone color and I'm just
going to apply this all over the lid and
also kind of blending up the brow bone
this is going to be our base kind of
shadow moving on I'm now going to use
this brown eyeshadow here and I'm just
going to basically pop that as the base
shadow for the whole lid and kind of
blending it out and diffusing it into
the crease so far so good I can tell
that these shadows are quite pigmented
there isn't a whole lot of fallout which
is a great plus from me I'm really easy
to blend so far which I'm kind of
impressed about and you can kind of see
that the texture of them is quite creamy
and buttery which is like amazing in
eyeshadows as long as they're not like
powdery and chalky I'm so good with that
as for the brush is holding up quite
well like it's not the best brush I've
ever used but let's be honest when is a
brush good when it just comes with the
actual palette pretty much never are now
going to take this brick kind of red
color and I'm going to run
prove the crease just to add a little
bit of pop of color through bear oh my
god this is such a nice color you guys
see that so pretty and lastly to finish
off the eyes I'm going to take a
combination of this dark brown as well
as this black here and just kind of
blend out my outer corner and kind of
deepen up with these shades so this is
the eye shadow look finished I am
obsessed with these eye shadows they are
super pigmented and also I find that
when I'm actually picking up the shadows
from the planet there is quite a lot of
fallout but when I actually apply it to
my eyes there is virtually no fallout at
all which is kind of weird because if
there is full light on the palette why
would there not be fallout on my face I
don't know that kind of doesn't add up
to me but either way the palette is
amazing I absolutely love the eyeshadows
the pigmentation is definitely there so
I would 100% recommend this eyeshadow
palette if you are on a budget I'm now
going to move on to the eyeliner and to
this I'm going to be using the
revolution double slick liquid liner so
there is two ends of this I'm pretty
sure one is slightly thinner and one is
slightly thicker which is definitely
great if you want more precision with
your eyeliners and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take the thinner end and
I'm just going to create a winged liner
with this as I usually do oh my god I am
actually obsessed with this eyeliner it
was so easy to use and look how a
pigmented eye is that is amazing I love
that so now that my eyeliner is finished
I'm going to move on to mascara
so the mascara I'm going to be testing
out today is the amazing Volume Mascara
for makeup revolution this is whoa look
at that that one is so big this is what
the one looks like and I absolutely
loved ones that are like really sick
because I feel like it really gives your
lashes so much more volume so let's see
how this one goes down okay so so far
the mascara looks okay I have to say
it's not one of my favorites I thought
this would be a lot better
the wand is super thick but it's not
really doing that much for my lashes but
then again it could just be my lashes at
quick story time I had lash extensions a
few weeks ago and now they have been
taken off I literally have like five
lashes left I've had a really bad
experience with them after I've taken
them off because they just completely he
pulled my lashes out and I don't know I
just have literally like five lashes
left and that is probably why this
mascara just isn't making them look any
good okay so this is my finished I like
I'm now going to move on to the lips and
I'm really excited for this because I'm
actually going to be testing out the
retro work matte lip kit and this is so
reminding me of the Kylie lip care I
feel like this is kind of what they were
trying to achieve with this product so
this isn't shaded rain which I kind of
watched on my hand when I got it I'm
really excited to try this because it
looks like it's going to be a really
pretty color so inside the lift kit you
get a lip liner of course and also the
actual lipstick even the packaging kind
of reminds me of the Kylie lip liner so
I'm going to apply the lip liner to my
lips first oh my god so the lip liner so
far is like so creamy
it literally is melting into my lips
right now so now that my lip liner is
actually done I'm going to apply the
liquid lipstick onto my lip so guys this
is the finished look I absolutely love
how it turned out on the lip is a nice
color but I'm not gonna lie I do like it
but I feel like it's far from this like
that isn't really a true representation
of what this color was going to be like
when even the kind of like color stamp
on the box is completely different it's
more like móvil and more like the Kylie
lip kit whereas this one is like full-on
pink so yeah it's kind of like a
misleading if you're looking at the box
but I still really like it as a
standalone color it's a tiny bit sticky
on the lip but it's nothing too crazy
it's still very wearable and I feel like
once it's completely dry it will be
totally fine overall I'm very pleased
with the whole work like in general the
contour was great
the highlight was really good and I also
really loved it I make up that I did
it's very pigmented there wasn't any
fallout so overall I gave a makeup
revolution a huge thumbs up from me I
definitely improved the makeup brands
and all the products that I have used
have come to around 50 pounds which I
feel like it's not that much for all the
products that I have touches and this is
literally like my full face of makeup
which I can use every single day so I
feel like that an okay amount to pay for
makeup let me know what you think down
below of this look if you guys are like
it I am really impressed with it if you
guys have any other suggestions for any
other makeup brands you would like me to
test out then let me know down below in
