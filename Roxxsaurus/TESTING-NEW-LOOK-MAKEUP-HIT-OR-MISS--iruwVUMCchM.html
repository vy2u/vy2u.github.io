hope you guys are having an awesome day
so far so today is a really exciting
video I say that pretty much every time
but today I am actually really excited
because I'm going to be doing another
testing makeup kind of video and today
I'm going to be testing out a new look
makeup now I've never ever purchased any
user look makeup before I have no idea
what it's going to be like so this is
going to be like a journey I'm gonna
take you guys along so we can see
together whether nunik makeup is worth
your money so I have met you went out
into new life and I have bought like the
full shebang in the full face of makeup
and everything you ever need FRA the
full face of makeup so I'm really
excited to try it you guys enjoy these
kinds of like one brand testing and
makeup tutorials then let me know down
below and also give this video a huge
thumbs up so I know to make more like
this in the future also comment down
below what brand you would like me to
try next I was thinking of doing Topshop
so let me know if you would like to see
that if you guys haven't subscribed
already make sure you do come and join
the dinosaur family I would love to have
you here I would add further ado let's
get into the video
okay so first up the first product I'm
going to be trying is the new look no
shine mattifying foundation this cost me
$7.99 I've got my receipt here so I
guess that's like a pretty okay price
for a foundation similar to kind of like
a drugstore foundation the packaging is
super cool I love like the matte glass
effect I have got this in shade natural
beige the sticker actually doesn't
really match the color of the foundation
if you do decide to buy this foundation
and make sure you have a look at the
actual bottle rather than looking at the
sticker kit the sticker doesn't actually
really show what the real true color of
the foundation is I have taken a two
pumps of this foundation and I'm going
to apply this with my nan Chi flat top
brush so far it seems to match my skin
tone quite well like it matches my neck
so that's a good sign I really actually
love the color of this kind of like a
tan color but it's not to like Orange II
which is really good it feels really
lightweight on the skin and it's also
smelling really Neider and you know what
it smells oh but it's a really pleasant
smell so far the coverage it seems like
a semi kind of cover
and the foundation is quite matte but
also bear in mind that today is like a
super hot day so I'm quite oily and
showing it already so we'll see how it
kind of copes with the heat whilst I'm
filming this video okay so so far the
coverage is pretty nice like I said it
looks a little bit shiny on the skin but
that could be because it's quite a hot
day today and my skin is kind of oily
today but overall the coverage is really
nice it covered quite a lot of like my
dark spots around here because I have a
few blemishes on my skin so yeah I'm
pretty impressed with the foundation
okay so the next place I'm going to be
testing today is the copper and perfect
concealer palette this cost me at $6.99
and inside here you get three different
shades of concealer and also a green
turn concealer for any blemishes or red
spots on your skin that you may have and
it also comes with this little like
spongy applicator which we all know is
completely useless no one ever uses
these but yeah so I'm going to be
basically using the lightest shade just
under my eyes and to cover up any dark
spots on my skin although I feel like
the foundation has already done that
quite well by the way if you're
wondering why I've got like full lashes
on it's because I've actually got lash
extensions on at the moment
so yeah don't think that I'm just
wearing like a false lashes for this
video okay so so far with the brush I'm
not really too impressed like it kind of
made my eye look a little bit white
rather than like skin toned it's not
very good coverage
I wouldn't say and it's kind of like I
don't know it's very like gooey like
when I'm putting my finger in it it's
kind of like it feels quite cheap
quality I'm not gonna lie and then a
trying to play it with my finger instead
just to see it's like the warmth of my
finger is going to make any difference
okay yeah that's making quite a bit
different so if you're going to buy this
palette I would say to probably use your
hands rather than a brush because the
warmth of your finger is going to do
this product London so yeah I'm just
going to apply this with my hand from
now on and guess
a slight bit of coverage I'm still not
convinced about the formula event with a
hundred percent say that there are so
many great alternatives to this palette
in the drugstore which are like the same
price but so much better quality when it
comes to like concealer palette okay so
that is the concealers done I'm not too
sure how I feel about it I feel like
it's left my eyes quite white looking
but maybe when we add a little bit of
bronzer to the face it's kind of going
to balance it out a little bit but so
far I just kind of look a little bit
ghostly I don't know if that's just me
in the viewfinder but let me know down
below what you guys think next in the
contour powder shaving kit so this comes
with three different shades so it's got
a step one which is contour step two
which is bronzer and then step three
which is highlight the highlight loads
are very matte though so I have no idea
what this is going to look like I'm
probably actually going to use the
highlight shade as a powder to set this
whole makeup in place because I didn't
actually pick up a powder from you like
I think I'm actually going to do that
first I'm just picking up the highlight
powder which is essentially just a matte
shadow and I'm just going to kind of
buff that into my skin to set the
foundation and concealer into place so
I'm now going to reach for the contour
shade and I'm just going to apply that
into the usual spots on my skin like my
cheekbones and my temples and my nose I
just kind of overall going to bronze up
my skin with this that is actually a
really nice contour it's not to oranjee
but it's not too ashy it's just like the
perfect kind of color I forgot to say
that this palette is also it's $6.99
just like the concealer palette so next
up I'm going to be using at the bronze
that baked face powder so this is meant
to be like a bronze kind of shimmer to
your skin but I definitely feel like
this is a highlighter like it's got a
highlighter written all over it this is
the color it's so pretty it's such a
nice like golden goddess kind of shade
and I have to have this one was another
color as well that I really liked but
they actually didn't have it in stock so
I was really annoyed but this one is
also really pretty so I'm just going to
take this on a little brush and just
swipe this onto my cheekbones and see is
that glow it's going
come true that is so pretty
oh my god I feel like a little glazed
donut slash a brick of gold and by the
way this was $7.99 again you get quite a
lot of products in here you get nine
grams of product so I guess like $7.99
is actually an OK price for a highlight
of like this kind of standard okay so my
favorite product all the ones I've tried
so far is definitely this one I love a
good highlight I'm now going to move on
to brows and I've just realized I forgot
to do brows so why picked up is this
music eyebrow pencil I'm just gonna
basically fill in my brows I don't have
too many bits to fill in at the moment
but I always like to fill in the very
kind of beginning of my brow just to
kind of feather them out cuz it's so far
I can tell that the product isn't that
pigmented like when I'm doing it in the
arch I can see kind of like the line
that I've just created here and it just
doesn't seem to be blending into my
actual eyebrow as well have to say is a
really nice color though it's not like
your typical like orange pencil like
it's actually really cool timed and ashy
which I really appreciate so verdict of
the brows I think they look okay but the
product was kind of like tedious to use
because it was going a little bit waxy
around this area and it wasn't really
clinging on to the skin which I didn't
really like I'm now going to move on to
the eye shadows I picked up this
eyeshadow palette with four different
shadows this is them here a very like
neutral and gold it's something that I
wear pretty much every single day which
you guys probably already know and are
sick of this kind of look but I'm just
going to be using a mixture of the
shutters and I'll let you guys know what
I think so first up I'm going to take
the brown kind of shadow and pop this
through my crease you guys know the
drill
so with this quote a three of the shape
on Matt and there's only one shimmer
shadow so I feel like that's a pretty
standard kind of quod palette which I
think you could use for like literally
every single day the shadows are very
wearable so you could definitely create
some really neutral looks for like work
or school the ice
actually only cost $4.99 which is
actually a lot cheaper then at some of
the other products that I've already
tried which is quite surprising because
you usually think that an eyeshadow
palette would be a little bit more I'm
now just going to take the gold
eyeshadow and just pop this all over my
lid and see what that looks like I feel
like this palette gives you quite a
limited choice of the looks that you
could do because the eyeshadows are so
neutral and muted so with the gold
eyeshadow I'm just applying this into
the very center kind of diffusing it
into the outer and inner corner I really
like this gold eyeshadow it's quite
pigmented but I do have to say it's not
as pigmented as the Primark eyeshadow
which I tested out a few weeks back
which I'll link down below Friday I'm
going to try is the ink precision
eyeliner from New Look Now this was at
399 which is what kind of standard price
for a felt tip liner it looks really
like sharp and black so I'm excited to
try this
okay this is very terrible so far and
also please excuse my lashes oh my god
guys do you see this I am so
disappointed with this eyeliner it's
like so dry and just streaky they're
literally hardly any product coming out
of this thing that is literally the best
I can do and it looks terrible I have
such high hopes for this when i swatched
it in the shop i was like yes this is
actually really nice and then i bought
this one and it's like dry so I'm
definitely disappointed would not
purchase this again so like I said I am
wearing lash extensions on my top lashes
so unfortunately I cannot fly the
mascara onto those but I can definitely
test it out on my bottom lashes so I
just bought the alone fitting mascara
which was actually a $4.99
I guess that a decent price for a
mascara so let's see how it works that's
made my lashes are really long you know
see that they're like so like nicely
separated and feathered out and I
actually managed to not get any on my
actual eyelid I do really like this
mascara I definitely approve like it's
made my lashes like super long super
separated which is everything I love in
a mascara now to finish off this load
I'm going to be reaching for this lip
liner from new life this isn't shade at
mid Brown and this cost me two pounds
fifty oh my god I love it
what do you guys think because I
definitely I'm in love with this lip
liner such a pretty nude color which is
like really nice and cool toned it's got
like a greyish kind of undertone to it
which is something that I absolutely
love in a lip liner this is very similar
color to the Rimmel cappucino the
planner which I use every single day and
now to finish off the lips I'm going to
be using this matte liquid lipstick
which only cost me three pounds which is
absolutely insane if this is going to be
a good lipstick I'm going to be like a
blown away to three pounds it's so cheap
for a liquid lipstick of like a good
standard and this is in shade its tone I
just thought I would go for like my kind
of signature brownish nude lip because I
think to do that in pretty much every
testing video like I haven't
since that I have been doing a very
similar look to this every time I test
out a brand of makeup but that's because
it's like my go-to look and I feel like
I can definitely judge the makeup more
like accurately when I compare it to
other brands that I've done if I am
doing the same look oh my god that
literally smells like chocolate
oh that's so beautiful cooks it doesn't
look finished it hasn't in a dried yet
but it applies it's so super smooth it's
so pigmented and it smells amazing it
literally smells of hot chocolate the
application was super smooth like the
lipstick formula is very soft which I'm
super impressed with I hope it's not
going to be too drying and my myths are
really sticking together which is always
a good sign so this is the finished look
essentially I have really enjoyed doing
this video for you guys like the like
actions are great the only thing I
really don't like is the winged liner
the eyeliner was terrible like it was so
dry and streaky and I don't know if
maybe that's because the product was
like expired but I managed to grab one
like right from the back to make sure
that no one had opened it so I don't
know I don't know if they would all be
like this but maybe I was just unlucky
I'm not too sure I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
