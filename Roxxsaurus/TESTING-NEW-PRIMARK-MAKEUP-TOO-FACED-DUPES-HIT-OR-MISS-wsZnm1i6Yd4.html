that mmm okay from that to that I'm so
shocked right now wow this is literally
doing nothing hey everyone welcome back
to my channel so today I am so excited
because I'm basically going to be
putting a primer off makeup but to the
test I literally have a whole bags worth
of makeup for my full face of prime up
makeup today and I'm so excited to test
some of these things out because I
picked up literally so many cool
products that are brand new in at
Primark and they look a lot like to face
makeup too so I'm really excited to see
whether they're gonna work or not if you
guys are enjoying these one brand of
testing makeup sort of videos that make
sure you guys give this video a thumbs
up and subscribe if you haven't already
also whilst you guys are down there make
sure you guys click the notification
Bell button down below to stay notified
of every time I post a new video but
without further ado let's get on into
the video okay so the first product I'm
gonna be using is this one right here
this is a primer it's called the PS
Instagram no filter priming oil and this
was 5 pounds it kind of looks like one
of those fast Sally drops I have no idea
how this is gonna look on my skin I'm
really hoping it's not gonna be too oily
this feels really really oily on my skin
I don't know if I really like it that
much
I don't put way too much on my forehead
oh my god I'm literally drowning in this
mmm actually once you blend it out it's
starting to kind of become quite tacky
on the skin so I feel like my foundation
will click onto it quite well now hold
the foundation I'm gonna be using at the
my perfect color velvet finish
foundation which looks like this this
was six pounds and let me just say
something this looks exactly like the
packaging for my Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation literally the bottle is
exactly the same like it's even the same
shape obviously this one hasn't got the
pipette on the top but when I saw this I
had to pick it off because it reminded
me so much of one of my favorite
foundations so we're gonna see if this
is anything like the luminous silk
because I feel like it has quite a
similar sort of consistency so I'm just
gonna kind of dab that all over my face
and then blend it out with a brush okay
hmm
it actually feels really nice on the
skin so far I actually really like this
it's actually quite moisturizing and it
does have that velvety finish I like it
claims on the bottle this is blending
out really nicely into the skin and it's
giving me a really even complexion so
I'm really liking this foundation at the
moment moving on to the concealer I'm
gonna be using and be my perfect color
concealer stick now this isn't usually
the type of thing I like to go for for
my concealer but it was the only
concealer I could find and this was only
ninety please I mean I don't have the
biggest of hopes for this but we shall
see how it performs who knows maybe
it'll be amazing I just got this in
shade porcelain it was the lightest
shade I could find for my under eyes so
we're just gonna go in okay so it feels
quite creamy but it also feels quite
waxy at the same time but I already know
how this is gonna sit on my skin I'm
just gonna blend this out too with the
warmth of my finger mmm okay it's coming
up my dark circles pretty well so I'm
not going to complain about that at all
I have to say it's not the worst conceal
I've ever tried but it's also not the
best where do you paid ninety P for this
so obviously I'm not gonna have the
highest of expectations but it does look
a little bit cakey once it's like
blended into the skin however it has
covered up my dark circles pretty well
so I kind of give it a thumbs up for
that reason I'm just gonna quickly set
my under eyes and bake with this powder
right here this is called the my perfect
color minimal powder and shade ivory I'm
just gonna use a little bit of this
under my eyes so that my concealer
doesn't crease I'm now gonna move on to
a bit of cream contour so I picked up
this might have a color moisturizing
foundation stick in a few shades darker
I mean this kind of looks a lot darker
than my skin tone and this was the only
one that was like dark enough for
contour that was available in store at
that moment when I went so I have no
idea if this is gonna look good it might
be way too dark but we're gonna test it
and see how it blends out and that kind
of thing so I'm just gonna go in and
basically contour my cheekbones as I
would with any regular contour woah that
is very dark it's very creamy so I feel
like this is gonna be quite easy to
blend out it's blending out really
well actually I'm actually quite
surprised I really like the color of it
it's not too warm toned either so I feel
like this would be a perfect foundation
stick for people with deeper skin tones
that blend it out so well oh my god
from that so that it blends out like a
dream I am so shocked right now I did
not expect this to blend out so well
especially because it's so dark for my
skintone okay I think I went a little
bit heavy-handed with the nose contour
this is gonna be a nightmare to blend
out I am looking way too bronzed right
now oh my god what is this it's kind of
looking really Pat you on my forehead on
camera but in person it's not at all
so this is really weird let me know
right now in the comments does this look
patchy because I feel like it does okay
moving on to the next product I'm gonna
be using is this one right here and I'm
so excited to try this out because it
looks so similar to two face products
I feel like this palette is kind of
along the vibes of the chocolate bar
palette from Too Faced obviously they're
not quite exactly the same but they have
definitely stolen the idea from Too
Faced so this cheek palette right here
it looks like this it's got four
different shades inside and I just love
the packaging is actually adorable it's
kind of like a mix between Kylie
cosmetics and two-faced all combined
into one I just love it and this was
only four pounds so that's such a good
price I would just realized you get two
blushes a bronzer and also a highlight
so that's like literally all the cheek
products you ever need in one palette so
I'm just gonna pick up the blusher from
this palette oh my god that is so
pigmented look at that and I'm just
gonna apply that to the apples of my
cheeks oh my god I am loving that that
is so pretty I'm now gonna move on to
you a bit of strobing to finish off the
skin now for this I picked up the strobe
in highlighting cream from Primark this
was only 2 pounds so let's put it to the
test
also this isn't shade champagne there's
I think 3 shades to choose from but I
picked up the gold one I'm just gonna
squirt a little bit of that on my hands
that is such a pretty color so I'm just
gonna take some of that and just pop it
onto my cheek bone as a slight highlight
hmm
I mean it hasn't really showed up much
on my cheekbone that's really strange
because it looks so pretty on my hand I
don't know if you guys can see that but
once I put it on my skin it looks really
nice but as soon as I blend it out it
really starts to lose its kind of Sheen
so to kind of top that strobing cream
off I'm just gonna go in with the
highlight shade from the cheek palette
I'm just gonna pick up some of that gold
highlighter from this palette and just
go over that strobe cream with this oh
my god yes this is so much better
wow that is so nice I'm just gonna
quickly fill in my brows now with this
three-in-one brow precision pencil and
powder and shade tobacco I'm really
hoping this is gonna be my shade this is
really really dark oh my god okay so
I've tried to make my brows look as soft
as I could but because the color is so
dark that was very difficult to achieve
so I feel like they still look very bold
and strong and not after what I usually
go for now a moving oiler to it the
eyeshadow I was so excited because I
have yet another Too Faced kind of
inspired palette this is called the PS
chocolate contour and eyeshadow palette
though this cost me six pounds and
inside you get one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten I shadow this
is what they look like
so first up I'm gonna take the shade
called a fondant I think that's how you
say it and I'm just gonna use that as
like an all-over sort of base color that
is actually a lot more pigmented that I
thought it would be pleasantly surprised
smoothing out I'm gonna take this shade
and melted which is this love heart
right here it's such a pretty shadow I'm
just gonna pop that through the crease
these are actually quite pigmented and
they're really super easy to blend
together so so far I'm actually quite
liking this palette I'm now gonna go for
the shade called a liqueur and I'm just
gonna pop that all over the lid oh no
there's actually quite a lot of fallout
with this one I don't know if you guys
can see that look how much fallout there
is what is that oh my god right let's
try and brush that away before it
becomes a disaster on my face I'm now
gonna take the shade cocoa right here
this is the darkest brown shade of the
pallet I'm just gonna use that
deepen up the crease further okay so
I've brushed away all over the fallouts
I've kind of tried to blend out the
eyeshadows as best as I could and this
is kind of what I came up with I'm now
gonna use another palette that I really
am excited to try out and that's the
chocolate eyeshadow palette now this one
is a lot smaller it's only got three
eyeshadows but I bought this one because
I really want to try out this shadow
right here it looks really pretty so I'm
just gonna pop that on my finger and
then I'm gonna take this and pop it
right in the center of my lid like so
that is so pretty oh my god that is
really really pigmented
so that is my eyeshadow complete I think
it looks pretty good obviously - the
fallouts I wish there were a tiny bit
more pigmented but they're definitely
still a buildable now gonna move on to
your eyeliner now for this I'm gonna be
using this one right here this is the
stay all day gel eyeliner which cost me
two pounds now I have to say I'm not the
best at using gel liner so I'm gonna try
and give it my best shot I'm just gonna
scrape the remainder of that eyeliner
and with this I'm just gonna align it on
my top lash line okay I mean I guess
it's kind of easy to use it's not too
difficult it definitely feels very
creamy it feels quite opaque - so that's
a good sign okay so that's the eyeliner
finished I went for a very subtle just
very thin line on the top lash line and
I'm now gonna move on to mascara so the
mascara I'm using today is called the
volumizing mascara
it's the lasting impact one and this
only cost me one pound which is so good
and the packaging really reminds me of
like Maybelline mascaras this is
literally doing nothing like nothing at
all to my lashes I mean it was only a
pound but I still expected more from
this mascara than this it just doesn't
really want to coat my lashes very well
I mean I'm just gonna say my lashes have
definitely seen better days so I'm gonna
give this one a thumbs down now lastly
for this makeup look I'm gonna be
testing out a new lip product that I saw
on the shelves and that's this one right
here so it kind of coincides with the
whole chocolate range from Primark at
the moment this is called the chocolate
maca lip kit so the lip kit is literally
so similar to at the two-faced ones I
feel like they definitely ripped off
their ideas but I guess this is a pretty
close dupe to the product for people who
can't really afford to face
so it comes with a molten glass as well
as a lipliner so I'm firstly going to
take the lip liner and just line my lips
with that mmm okay
lip line is pretty good so far I mean
it's not the most pigmented lip liner
I've ever used but it's pretty decent
and it's quite creamy to apply as well
I'm now gonna take the molten at a lip
gloss and see how that works
okay so I feel like someone's either
already tried it or squeezed at least
cuz the product is already out onto the
brush it definitely doesn't look used as
if it's been applied to the lips because
the whole brush would have been dirty oh
my god it smells really nice and this is
the finished lip look that when I
purchased this lip kit I actually
thought that this lipstick would have
been a matte liquid lipstick but I quite
like the fact that it's shiny it's very
moisturizing it feels really nice on the
lips and it definitely smells a really
good now this whole dip kit was only
three pounds which I guess is a pretty
good tube for the two-faced product
seeing as the two face products are a
lot more expensive but obviously I don't
know how this will wear on my lips
throughout time but as the overall
finished outcome I'm actually pretty
impressed with all the products I feel
like they look quite good on the skin as
a whole we kind of started off looking
already patchy and way too bronzed but
now that I'm looking at the finished
look I feel like everything looks pretty
good my skin looks quite flawless my
eyeshadow looks really nice I'm
definitely a fan of that shimmery shadow
that we popped on the very center of the
lid I love the highlighter and the
blusher from the chocolate palette one
product that I definitely really didn't
like was the mascara I just feel like
it's done nothing for my lashes at all
but overall for the whole face of makeup
I only spent 39 pounds and 40 pence
which is actually pretty good like I
have the receipt right here it's
actually pretty affordable for all of
the products that we purchase you be
sure to give this video a thumbs up if
you guys enjoyed it and if you guys
haven't never seen my face before make
sure you do subscribe before you leave I
would love to have you come and join the
dinosaur family but that is all from me
thank you so much for watching and I
hope to see you guys in my next video
