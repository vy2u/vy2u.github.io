channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far so in today's video I
am going to be testing out yet another
weird beauty product to actually
purchase this product like three weeks
ago and I've been waiting for it ever
since and then I actually saw money
everywhere do this exact same video the
other day so just quickly wanted to let
you know that I did purchase those ages
ago so I'm not copying anyone I guess
great minds think alike so the product
I'm gonna be testing out today is this
little bad boy right here and this is
actually like a peel-off foundation
slash primer I guess when I saw this in
an article online I was like I have to
try this for you guys if you guys like
these types of videos and would like to
see me try it more beauty products let
me know down below and also give this
video a huge thumbs up and if you guys
are brand new hi I'm rogue seek of
enjoying it the dinosaur family by
subscribing down below but that is
enough rambling without further ado
let's get on into the video okay so the
product that I'm testing today is called
a real skin patch I think I paid around
10 pounds for this I think online on
eBay I'll link it down below for you
guys if you guys want to try it out
yourself I think this product is
designed for people who have acne and
want to have like a smooth complexion to
upper like in a foundation over the top
and this is also meant to block out the
foundation from going into your pores
it's meant to act as a barrier between
your foundation and your skin meaning
that if you have acne or sports or your
skin is just prone to breakouts this
should kind of act as like a barrier in
between that so all of the foundation
doesn't clog up your pores this product
right here is actually a Korean product
and I know that over in Korea makeup in
skincare is like so important and they
always do like the best products for
skincare so I'm sure this is going to be
really good so inside there is 15 grams
of product the product is made from
natural tea tree which is 60% and then
it's got something good Magda castor
site made it cassis I I'm not too sure
so I guess we should now put it to the
test so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to take a tiny bit of the product
actually I'm gonna do quite a lot just
because I really want this to peel off
so the product is really clear in
consistency and it's kind of watery so
I'm just gonna apply this straight to my
face okay so I'm just gonna apply this
to one side of my face I'm just gonna do
my cheek so I'm just rubbing that on top
my skin ok so I've got quite a thick
layer there it doesn't actually smell
too bad just smells of tea tree oil you
guys don't like tea tree oil then maybe
don't buy this product but I personally
really like it I'm just gonna give this
a few minutes to dry and then I'll come
back and let you guys know what I think
so now that it's starting to dry a
little bit it's starting to feel quite
like stiff especially around this bit
where I have like like minor hair on my
face it's starting to kind of like pull
it doesn't feel as tight as a face mask
would but it feels just a little bit
weird like I can definitely sense that
I've got something on my face
but I do have to say it's given me that
glow though look at that okay so I feel
like it as dry as it can be and it's
looking pretty like oily I would say
like this kind of is meant to make your
face not like it'll really but it's
actually ending up making you look wavy
so I don't really understand that but
I'm gonna go in with some foundation and
just apply that over the top of the
product and see what happens I'm just
gonna dab on some foundation so just as
I was applying my foundation I started
to see that the actual primer has
started to peel off like just from me
applying foundation I don't know if you
guys can see that but there's like a
little bit of the actual primer starting
to peel off which does not look good
because it's making my face look crusty
maybe this wouldn't happen if I used a
Beauty Blender because I did use a brush
so perhaps maybe use a Beauty Blender
with this kind of product but I can
already see that the primer underneath
is starting to kind of like crumble like
maybe not crumble but roll up and I
don't know it looks really bad I have to
say judging by what it looks like after
I've applied the foundation I feel like
it's not making the texture of my skin
look any better and that's exactly what
this product should be doing I mean it's
designed for people who have acne and
have textured skin but for me it's just
creating more texture than I already
have on my skin can you guys see that
little like part where it's starting to
peel off and also it's starting to kind
of like bunch up over in this area and
also over on this part where I have like
heads and stuff on my face it just
doesn't look good so I guess now the
thing we will want to see is the peel
porn of course I feel like I'm gonna
start from this little pot here that's
already started to peel so I'm gonna
zoom you guys in so you guys can see
okay here it goes oh my god this is so
satisfying though this is so satisfying
guys although the product didn't really
work I feel like it's actually worth
buying it
just to do this it's actually quite
difficult to peel it off around the
circumference of my face here where I've
got a little bit like hair because it's
really clinging on to the hair so I kind
of have to like roll it off my face now
so I've just decided to apply this all
over my face pretty much I'm left out
like my forehead cause I just can't be
asked to do with that but I did decide
to put it on the lower half of my face
because I just want to do some more peel
porn because that is like the most
satisfying thing out of this video I'm
just Fanning this drive with a Sherlock
DVD cuz casual who even owns DVDs
anymore
so no look how cool this DVD is it like
changes between the two characters and
like a city sausage that I am I actually
didn't turn on the mic for this part so
there is no voice which is why you are
hearing this voice over right now but I
just quickly wanted to show you guys how
satisfying this looks once you're
peeling off the actual primer
although like I said the actual product
isn't that great but I think that you
know we can justify buying this for the
amount of satisfaction that you will get
from peeling off at this product so my
face is hella red right now so please
excuse that but I honestly feel like
this product is a big no-no from me
because I don't know it just really made
like my skin look really patchy and dry
which I obviously don't have like as you
can see my skin looks fine and then
after I applied it it just created a
whole lot of texture that wasn't there
in the first place so I feel like for
people who have acne and have textured
skin this would literally be a no-go
because it would make things so much
worse but let me know what you guys
think down below have you tried this
product before like did it work for you
if
it didn't work for me but it might work
for some of you out there so do let me
know in the comments I really do hope
you guys enjoy these videos of me
testing out with beauty products because
I ruined my face so you guys don't have
to do let me know what kind of product
you would like me to test our next if
there's anything you've seen and you are
kind of like iffy about let me know in
the comments and I'll test it out for
you guys but that is all from me for
today I really hope you guys are having
a wonderful day and I'll see you guys in
my next video bye what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
