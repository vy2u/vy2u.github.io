hope you guys are having an awesome day
so far so today as you can tell from the
title I'm going to be testing out
prymaat makeup for you guys
whenever you think of Primark you never
really think of makeup I really
purchased any makeup from Pro Mod and
I'm not too sure why because the prices
are great and I've just never got around
to testing them to see if they actually
work so today here I are testing the
full face of makeup from Primark to see
if it's worth the money if you guys
enjoyed this video make sure you smash a
few subs up just down below and also
subscribe I would love to have you here
just hit that big red button down below
and you'll be part of the dinosaur
family and this copy is also from
Primark I bought this especially for
Coachella yes I'm going to Coachella and
I'm so excited I'm going to be daily
blogging the whole trips out make sure
you guys out we'll see subscribe to you
with my daily vlogging Channel
walkthroughs vlog so you guys don't miss
out on them videos but that is an
unraveling
without further ado let's get into the
video okay so the first thing I have
purchased was a set of brushes because I
thought I would make our fair test and
use actual Primark brushes so I've got
this really nice satin it's like really
marbled and really pretty and this right
here has five brushes inside and this
was worth seven pounds it also comes
with like a little makeup pouch which it
Renea though the gonna see if this is
worth the money it would help if I could
get into it first so first up is of
course a foundation so I purchased the
primer long web mineralized foundation
this is with vitamin A me and it's also
got SPF 15 I got it in shade is 0-1
ivory and I'm really hoping this is
going to match my skin the packaging is
really nice I think it's very simple but
it kind of also looks a little bit
high-end the way the glass on the
packaging is kind of like muted and you
can see the foundation through it
reminds me of the Giorgio Armani
packaging so I really need the packaging
let's see if the product matches my skin
though I would say like the fact that
it's got a pump
I think foundations at the pump are like
instantly ten times better so this is
the foundation it looks quite high
coverage but we will see when I apply
onto the skin I'll just lie the
foundation I'm going to be using and
this little toothbrush makeup brush at
Probert Primark and this is one of those
like our teeth dupe thing I bought it
first
previously a
I've used it like once or twice and so
far I'm really impressed with it the
smell kind of reminds me of a Mac
foundation like it's not exactly the
most pleasant smell but I'm sure I can
overlook it if the foundation is
actually good so so far is matching my
skin color quite well it has quite a bit
of coverage which I'm happy about
and once they start kind of blending in
the foundation it gives you what is this
like flawless finish and the smell does
go away which is a good thing so this is
what the foundation looks like on my
face I feel like it's informed it quite
well the only thing I would say is that
it has become a little bit patchy on my
skin where it's kind of picked up my dry
patches but apart from that it was a
pretty close match to my actual skin
type the next one I'm going to use is
the primer contour kit these contour kit
come in at two different shades so this
one is a slightly darker one because I
wanted a little bit more of a pigment
payoff so this is what the contour kit
looks like inside it's got three
different shades and it has a huge
mirror which is always great because I
love anything with a big mirror that you
can just do your makeup or really
quickly and easily in and what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to really
lightly sweep that into my cheek bone
just to define it and just kind of make
my features pop a little bit more so far
so good I really like the fact that it's
quite subtle and obviously you can build
up the pigment if you like and really
impressed with the car because I thought
this could be a little bit on the warm
side which a lot of like cheap Asian
bronzers do kind of tend to look but
this one not at all I am really
impressed with how cool toned the color
actually is honestly I love it what do
you guys think I think it looks really
good the brush is really soft as well
like I thought it could be a little bit
stiff but not at all like it's actually
really really nice and it's actually
quite dense as well so this could be a
really good brush for foundation I'm
also going to apply this into my
forehead just to warm up my forehead a
little bit since the foundation is kind
of on the pale side by the way my hair
band is from Claire's I absolutely love
it how cute is it so now I'm going to
fill in my eyebrows what I bought for
this is this little pencil
this is in shade medium although it is
quite a dark pencil so I'm really scared
that this was going to be way too dark
for me it also comes with a little
spooley on the other side this pencil
with only a pound so I mean I don't have
great expectations for it but we will
see so far it's super creamy but it is
also really dark I'm trying to be really
light handed with it so my eyebrows
don't end up to looking really sharp
well I made the eyebrow way too pointy
I'm going to use the spoolie side to try
and blend this out and make it that a
little bit softer so this is what one
brow looks like I'm actually quite
impressed with it like the color in and
too bad it's not too warm time and it
was actually not too dark you want
really heavy-handed with this I think it
could look too extreme but if you just
take your time and just do it real I
hand it and then brush out really well I
think it looks really good so I'm going
to do the same thing to the other brow
so these are my eyebrows are done I
think they look actually okay they may
look a little bit harsh on the inner
corners but overall I think that's still
quite wearable I definitely wear them
out though so the next time I'm gonna be
using is a blusher now this one I got
was only one pound fifty can we just can
we just so the color is super knives are
kind of like this peachy orange etern
blush whoa on the brush I can already
see that it's super pigmented I have
high hopes you my friend so here it goes
that's really nice oh my gosh I love it
so now the star of the show is the
remark precious metals collection
complete face palette this was around 6
pounds and initially has so many
different things inside so it's got a
bronzer it's got a highlighter
it's got like a shadows up here and then
lip products here I'm actually only been
using and the eyeshadows and not the lip
product to create my eye lip but these
eyeshadow looks so pigmented
already so first up I'm going to take
the kind of bronze shadow and I'm going
to pop this into my crease as like a
transition color there um this is ash
you're really doing did you guys
I would say about this palette is that
when I'm kind of like dabbing my brush
in there's like loads and loads of
fallout but apart from that I really
like it I am super super impressed for
these like in normal life so next I'm
going to take the gold eyeshadow here
because I'm just dying to use this like
it looks insane I'm just going to take
my finger and just kind of Pat that in
there and then I'm gonna Pat this onto
my eyelid
oh gosh
look at that that is so much pigment
this is actually mental do you see how
like pigmented that gold shadow is I'm
actually obsessed with my god eyeshadow
I'm going to take the bronze shadow as
well and just applied it to my bottom
lash line I'm now going to take the
highlighter shadow and just apply this
into my inner corners as well as my brow
bone just to give it that a little bit
of highlight guys can we just look at
the eye shadow all of the products so
far I am mostly impressed by the
eyeshadow palette and lastly for the
skin I'm going to take the highlighter
shade and just apply this onto my
cheekbones whoa
damn girl that glow though if there's
anything you guys buy from Primark I
definitely recommend this palette right
here because I am in love I'm now going
to move on to the eyeliner you guys know
I love my winged liner so I'm going to
be using and this liquid liner from
Primark and this was only one pound like
one pound okay so it comes with a little
brush like the actual applicator is
bristles so that's always good because
it means you get more of a precise line
so far so good
it looks really matte and like really
really pigmented black and quick easy to
use as well the applications really like
nice and handy I think it pretty well
you guys alright better depression I'm
actually quite impressive the liner it
was really easy to use it's really matte
black which is great obviously I don't
know how it's going to wear because I've
only just applied it it might not last
very long but for my first impression
I'm really quite pleased I'm now going
to be wrong to you at mascara and this
one here is the high definition mascara
ultra volume and lift the brush is very
small I did not expect that I thought it
would be like really big and like clumpy
but no it's very small a bit so I'm
going to take the trip in and see how it
goes
so the 4-wheeler is very less watery
which applies really easily onto the
lashes which is a good thing it really
nicely separates the lashes and done the
clumps so this is a mascara finished I
am actually quite sick of it like my
lashes are pathetic as it is but this
mascara made them look like really
separated and quite long which it did
now a lot of the I'm going role to the
list and for this I'm going to use it
this little lip liner here this is
called the integral kiss proof lip liner
pencil and I don't know what shade it is
in I don't think they actually do shade
so it's just like drop that so just like
this nice kind of movie brownish color
so what I'm going to do it is I'm just
going to outline my little bit and also
fill it in just the slightest
whoa guys I am so impressed with this
lip liner like the color is on point
it's so close to my natural lip color
which means that I can like over line
with it just the slightest and it still
looks really natural and now to finish
off the mint I'm going to use the insta
go intense liquid lipstick in shade and
nude selfie then cost me two pounds it
looks really promising the color looks
amazing so this is the initial color of
what it looks like on the lips before it
has dried I did not think that it would
turn out like this
partially kind of undertone I mean I
just don't look like it in the actual
packaging but I just expected it to be a
little bit more brownish regardless I
stopping it's a really really nice color
it's a really nice cool tone kind of
wearable everyday nude color so that was
me testing out the prime of makeup I am
so pleased with how this makeup has
turned out like you would not be able to
tell that I'm wearing a full face of
Primark makeup would you I am absolutely
in love with this palette this is the
precious metals collection complete face
palette and I'm going to say if you guys
