I hope you guys are having an awesome
day so far in today's video as you can
tell from the title I'm going to be
testing fake eBay makeup versus the
original genuine product so I'm going to
do like a half-and-half comparison so
you guys can really tell the difference
between the real and the fake makeup and
the products that I'm going to be using
in this video as some of my absolute
all-time favorite products that I have
tried which are pretty much used every
single day I have been wanting to film
this video for like absolutely ages and
I've been waiting on all of these
products for literally like a month and
they have finally just arrived so I'm so
excited to finally be here filming this
video for you guys if you guys enjoyed
this kind of video make sure you smash
that thumbs up just down below and also
come and subscribe come and join the
dinosaur family because I don't know if
you guys are noticing but we are very
close to two mil two million dinosaurs
on this channel we are not that far now
so I'm really excited to be and now I'm
seeing the fact that I'm going to be
doing a two million giveaway when we hit
two million on this channel and is going
to be absolutely huge there's gonna be
so many winners so you guys definitely
should subscribe so you don't miss out
but without ever rambling let's get into
the video the first products I'm going
to try out for you guys is a recent
favorite of mine and it's the Anastacio
glow kit this is the this is the Sun
dipped blow kit so this is the real
version is what it looks like inside so
the fake version of the anastasi glow
kit is this it looks very similar the
packaging is pretty much identical at
first glance as you can see they are so
so similar literally the only difference
is that the fake one actually has the
anastasi logo right in the center which
the original one doesn't also the color
is a little bit different the original
one is a little bit darker as you can
see but on the outside they are pretty
much the same I mean who cares about
packaging that much anyway what matters
is what's on the inside this is my first
time opening this up so let's have a
look what the colors are like okay so
from a first kind of glance I can tell
that the colors are a little bit
different so these are the two
highlighting palette next to each other
I
like they are very similar in colors
there are slight variations for example
this shake here which is called summer
it's actually a lot more golden than in
the fake one I feel like the fake
version has a little bit more of a
champagne undertone not so much gold
apart from that all the other shades are
very similar the shade moonstone is
pretty much identical it's yet it's a
little bit more shimmery in the original
palette rather than the fake but the
shade bronze looks very very similar
again so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to apply the two highlighters on
to both sides of my face so this is
going to be my real product side and
this is going to be my fake product side
okay so I'm going to start off with the
real anastasi glow kit and I'm going to
take the shade summer which is this one
here and I'm just going to apply this to
the very top of my cheekbones as I
usually do this is the color that is my
favorite from the palais i absolutely
love it as you can see this highlight is
just so beautiful it's so blinding and
just really nice and glowy and i
absolutely love it i'm now going to take
the fake Anasazi blow kit and use the
same color while guys look at that as my
initial reaction i am really liking it i
think it's just as pigmented as the
original i don't know about the wearing
how it will kind of sit on your skin
over time but as an initial kind of
swatch i think it looks really beautiful
on the skin it was really easy to blend
and it's very pigmented I'm actually
really interested to see how this
palette smells oh my god oh this really
I'm not kidding you it actually smells
like rubber shoes this is literally what
rubber sole trainers smell like not that
it's a bad thing like I don't really
care that much for smell because I'm not
going to smell it when it's applied to
my cheekbones or anything but I really
do wonder what is inside this and
because it was very cheap okay so I'm
just reading through the ingredients on
the back of the both the palettes and it
is literally identical the ingredients
are exactly the same which kind of
worries me a little bit either we are
getting really ripped off paying this
amount of money for the original palette
when the ingredients are exactly the
same in this one or the fake makeup come
is claiming that the ingredients are the
same as the original product but they're
actually not which I think this one
worries me a little bit more because if
these ingredients are not true
then we don't really have a way of
telling what is actually in this makeup
palette that's one thing I definitely
have to address even though I am really
impressed with this palette I do not
want to kind of promote these products
to you guys in case they have any
harmful products inside like I'm
probably not going to use these products
on a daily basis you never know with
buying things off of ebay like from
China you just don't know what kind of
ingredients they're going to be putting
in these products I just want you guys
to be a little bit more cautious about
that because you know you just don't
want to put harmful things onto your
face so the next product I'm going to
use is another Anasazi Beverly Hills
product this is the dip brow pomade in a
shade blonde as you can see I have hit
pan on it and I'm pretty much running
out so you can definitely tell I really
love this now the fake version of this
product looks like this it came in this
nice little box okay Wow okay so the
outer packaging locus very similar it
has the same little top of the Anastasia
Beverly Hills logo I can tell that this
one is slightly cheaply printed like
it's not as nice as this one but who
cares it's just a logo so overall it
says Anastasia Beverly Hills on both of
them at the front and the fake one
obviously like I said it's just a little
bit less neat than the original one okay
I'm gonna take the genuine real pomade
and apply this to my right eyebrow as I
usually do okay so I'm going to open up
the fake product for the first time and
woah okay so this is the product it
looks very promising I'm going to
compare the two colors side-by-side so
these are the colors as you can see they
are very very different from each other
this is kind of like I don't know I
can't even explain it it just looks a
little bit warmer in the pot it just is
not the same color but I'm just going to
give this a go and see how it looks on
color is definitely different it's a
little bit more topi like it's got kind
of like a purple undertone
to it in my opinion okay so these are
the eyebrows finished the real one is a
little bit more brown toned just a
little bit more wearable for an everyday
kind of eyebrow than this one I don't
know if you can tell from afar but it
definitely has like a purple undertone
to it which I'm not really a big fan of
I have to say the product did apply
really smoothly and really evenly but I
would say haven't really covered up my
sparse areas of my brow you can
definitely see this part is still quite
sparse no matter how much I tried to
power the product in there it just
didn't really want to cover it up and
less stand-alone product I don't think
it's the worst it definitely did a
really nice job of filling in my brows
making it look a little bit more however
if you directly compare it to the
original I would definitely a hundred
percent say that the original is so much
better now that my eyebrows are finished
I'm going to move on to the eyes and I'm
super excited about this because for the
original product I'm going to be using
my beloved Naked 1 palette this is the
first original Naked palette by urban
decay but this is the fake palette and
this is what it came like and if you
guys have ever seen that the packaging
of the real one you can definitely tell
that this is not what it looks like so
this is the palette and let's just do a
comparison side-by-side they are pretty
much the same the word naked is a little
bit more gold on the fake one and the
fake one definitely feels a lot cheaper
like this original one feels so heavy
and like well-made and sturdy however
this one just feels like really flimsy
and just not very well made these are
the colors the top one is the fake and
the bottom one is the original so at
first glance the colors do look very
similar there are some colors that just
don't look exactly the same for example
the shade version kind of looks like a
purple you guys probably can't tell on
camera but this is very much a purple
shadow same was sin sin isn't very close
at all sin on the fake palette kind of
looks like sidecar on the original
palette are faked is just a matte like a
mask in color whereas half-baked in the
original one is one of my favorite
colors and it's like this really
super-nice gold color so I'm kind of
disappointed about that because yeah
that's like my favorite color and it's
nothing like it in the fake palette but
yeah I'm gonna try and recreate my
everyday kind of makeup look with these
eyeshadows and see what it looks like so
first I'm going to take naked from the
real palette and just apply that in my
crease as always and then limiting buck
which is a slightly darker nude color
and I'm going to just apply this further
into the crease to deepen it up even
more I'm then taking smog and just
applying this in the center of my lid
kind of blending it into the outer
corner as well as the inner corner so
first I'm going to take the same color
naked from the fake palette and just
apply this into my crease just like I
did with the other eye okay so I can
already tell the colors aren't nowhere
near as pigmented as the original ones
are I'm then going to take the same
eyeshadow buck and apply this further
into the crease to deepen up it kind of
feels like I'm rubbing a whole lot of
nothing onto my eye because nothing is
showing up now lastly I'm going to take
the shadow smog and hope to god that
this is going to save this eye look
because I don't have any hopes for this
anymore
okay so smog is a little bit more
pigmented than the other eye shadows but
but it's very difficult to get like an
opaque color out of it it's very crumbly
okay guys so this is literally the best
I could do it looks like one of my eyes
is smaller than the other so that's just
great I'm not gonna lie probably the
worst palette I have ever tried I really
was hoping that this would be better
than it is I'm not here to lie to you
guys I just want to give you my honest
opinion of this and I just don't think
it's worth your money at all if you guys
cannot afford the original Naked palette
from Urban Decay I would much rather you
guys buy like a Maybelline palette or
like the L'Oreal palette I'm just going
to pop on some mascara and eyeliner and
then I'll be right back to do the lips
and now that my eyes are finished we can
move on to the lip and a fuller lip I'm
really excited because I am going to be
using the original Kylie lip kit
Dolce K for my right-hand side for my
left-hand side I'm going to be using a
fake Kylie lip kit that I got from Evo
for around six pounds so first things
first the packaging that looks it very
similar to the original Kylie lip kit I
unfortunately don't have the original
packaging for this product because I
bought it so long ago but from what I
can remember this is pretty much exactly
what it looked like
so my first opinion of this is that they
have definitely copied the exact Kylie
lip kit packaging to the tee or shall I
say to the Kay I kind of smudged the
print where it says Kylie which I feel
like is very unprofessional and Kylie I
don't think she would ever do that so
this is definitely a fake I feel like
the fake one is slightly more of a pinky
tone and the kylie one is slightly more
orange toned a fake one is much darker
than the original Kylie lip kit but I
feel like the best way to compare these
products is to adjust applied into my
lips and see how they look so to line my
lips I'm going to be using the Kylie
pencil that came in the fake kits
I don't have the original one anymore so
I've just finished doing my liner and I
am actually quite impressed with the lip
liner I feel like it's just a smooth of
an application as the original lip liner
from Kylie the color is really gorgeous
so I probably will actually use this
because it is quite a good line I just
on its own so now I'm going to take the
original Kylie lip kit and apply this
just to the right-hand side of my lips
so the original product is now applied
so I'm going to take the fake lip care
and first I'm going to see what it
smells like because the Kylie lip kit
have a really distinctive vanilla smell
so you guys oh my gosh wait I feel like
they kind of tried to make it smell like
vanilla but it's not quite there okay so
I'm going to take this now and apply
this to the left hand side so guys the
lipstick is pretty much dry and you
really look at the lip I don't think you
can tell that much difference between
the color I can definitely see that this
is a little bit more pinky than this one
there isn't that much difference between
the two colors I'm really surprised and
a lot of relate I'm going to try for you
guys is
yeah Mac lipstick so this is the Russian
red matte lipstick this is probably one
of them most popular lipsticks ever and
I absolutely love it so much and this is
the fake MAC lipstick this looks pretty
much identical to each other however if
you are in this room and you could feel
the weight of both of these this
literally feels like it's got nothing
inside like it feels empty this is the
lipstick it looks very shiny whereas
it's supposed to be a map like you guys
can probably see that even from a
distance this one is matte and this one
is so shiny so again I'm just going to
apply it the real one to the right hand
side and apply the fake one to the left
hand side so this is the finished a
lipstick as you can see the color is
just so different a Russian red the
original one is so much darker than the
fake one or is this Li no similarity at
all I wouldn't say so although the fake
lipstick is nowhere near similar to
Russian red I feel like they actually
did quite a good job of making it look
like Ruby woo also from Mac you guys
look at the two colors they are very
similar maybe they put the wrong label
on the fake lipstick who knows so that
is all for this video I hope you guys
enjoyed seeing me compare and test the
fake email products to the original
products I have lots of fun filming this
video and testing at the fig products
for you guys I definitely feel like
there are a lot of nice gems in there
such as the highlighter I definitely
feel like the highlighter is worth the
money and if you can't afford the
original then I would suggest you buy
the fake one because it's still really
good the eyeshadows were definitely and
now because there just was no
pigmentation at all overall I have
nothing against faith makeup I think
it's a really good way for people who
can't afford expensive makeup such as
students or just younger people who
don't have money to test out products
they want to try but can't necessarily
afford so even though some of these
products were really good I would
suggest to also try and look into just
buying alternatives of the expensive
stuff in the drugstore cos there are so
many drugstore brands that do amazing
products these days they use the Lord's
for drugstore makeup
so from me for today I hope you guys are
having an awesome day and I'll see you
very soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
