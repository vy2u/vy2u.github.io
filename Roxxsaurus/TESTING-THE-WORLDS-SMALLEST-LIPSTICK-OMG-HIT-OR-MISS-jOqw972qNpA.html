today is the first video of 2018 from me
and I'm so excited for this year I had
such an amazing 2017 all thanks to you
guys and your support and I just cannot
wait for 2018 and all the videos I've
got a plan for you guys I hope you guys
have an amazing New Year's and also
Christmas but to start off this yeah I
just thought I have to go back to my
roots and test some weird products so I
actually bought this weed product a few
months ago actually and I completely
forgot that I had this on me like I
completely forgot that it was in my
drawer so I'm now finally sitting down
and testing the winkie luxe mini lip
pill kit these are honestly the world's
smallest lipsticks they're literally
like pill sized maybe a little bit
bigger than a pill but they're so cool
and when I saw these online I just knew
I had to try them out so inside this
little kit you get five different shades
of lipstick and they are honestly
beautiful this is honestly crazy guys
this is how small the lipstick are and
just for comparison this is a regular
MAC lipstick and it is absolutely tiny
and compared so the cost of these are
five mini lipsticks in total was
actually 16 dollars I believe and I feel
like that's kind of pricey considering
this sucks more lipsticks but if you are
a lipstick junkie and you love trying
new shades then this will be like the
perfect gift for someone or just even to
treat yourself like it's just such a
nice little product that you can test
out different shades to see whether they
suit you and obviously it's in such
small quantities so if you don't like
any of these shades it's not that big of
a deal but favorite thing about this is
just how cool they are like you can just
slip this in your pocket or like your
wallet and you're good to go and it
doesn't take up a lot of space either
there the first thing I can definitely
say is that these would be perfect for
traveling now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take all of these lipsticks and
just swatch them on my arm just to see
what kind of texture they are so this is
how smaller the lipstick is and this is
what it looks like inside is so cool so
first up I'm gonna swatch the shade meow
on my wrist oh that's so creamy I
actually really like that
very pigmented and is very creamy as
well so so far I'm really liking that
color now reaching for shade heart I'm
just gonna get underneath that is such a
pretty color it kind of makes me think
of Mac Russian red because it's
definitely got that like blue tint to it
and then taking the shade royal which is
like a really nice purple color is so
pretty this is the next shade so it's
kind of like a brown sort of nude color
I really like that and the last shade is
called a city and it's a very dark kind
of like plum maroon kind of color but
it's so beautiful on the skin look at
that but these are all the shades I
actually really love all of them I
definitely Rock every single one because
even though they're quite out there in
the actual hills you think that this is
almost like black but it's actually such
a pretty like autumnal color okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take
the lightest shade which is shade at
pippi I'm just gonna apply to my lips
and see what I think
whew okay so I actually really really
like the shade of it it's so like
neutral and pretty the only thing I have
to say is that the lipstick itself
actually smells like children's makeup I
don't know if you guys have ever owned
like children's lipsticks but this
smells exactly like a children's
lipstick which is so weird how it takes
me back though like I don't mind it but
it definitely just smells a bit weird it
feels very nice on the lips like the
texture is really pretty it kind of got
like a semi matte finish it's not too
matte but it's definitely not like super
shiny so I really like the finish a bit
I'm now gonna go in with the red
lipstick just over the top
I really love this color I think it's so
pretty the application of these
lipsticks is quite easy considering of
how small the actual lipstick is the
only thing I would say is that I wish
the actual tip of the lipstick was a bit
more slanted for more extra precision
especially around the edges of the lip I
just wish you were able to get that
really crisp kind of line especially
with a lipstick this dark I'm now going
to take the darker nude color which is
this really nice and brown shade and I'm
just gonna try this on as well so this
is the brown shade again I think it's
super pretty I really like about these
lipsticks is that every single shade is
at the same texture the same kind of
epicness you only really need one layer
of the lipstick as well so that's good I
really am loving the texture it's really
moisturizing on my lips and I feel like
my lips are so dry right now especially
now that it's winter you'll probably see
how chapped they are without the
lipstick and I really like the fact that
their lipstick doesn't cling onto those
chat areas of my lips so I'm kind of
rewriting the formula right now but now
I'm gonna take the purple shade and just
apply that to my lips I am living for
this color I love it so much with this
one it was kind of a little bit more
difficult to actually apply it really
super even you'll probably see that the
edges aren't as crisp but that's because
the color is just so bright and so
vibrant and so out there that you can't
really get away with making mistakes so
for this shade especially I do wish that
the lipstick have a slide rather than a
curved overall I still really like the
shade I just don't know how practical
this would be if you were applying it on
the go which is kind of what the
lipsticks are made for to be used or
whilst traveling so I feel like to make
them even better they should introduce
that curved kind of edge just to help a
girl out you know and this is the very
last shade which is the dark maroon sort
of color I'm actually really nervous to
apply this one because like they said
it's just such an unforgiving color
okay so I do hope I didn't okay job at
least applying this lipstick it's just
such a nice color but it's so dark so
all those edges just need to be so
pressed I mean you could always just
touch up with some concealer but if
you're on the go that might be a little
bit difficult but I do really love this
shade it's like the perfect maroon
autumnal kind of color
so those are all of the lipstick swatch
I'm actually genuinely surprised at how
well they've performed I love the
texture I actually really like the smell
although it does smell like a children's
kind of lipstick I still really like it
because it just takes me back to like my
childhood the colors are absolutely
beautiful as you guys saw they apply
really well they don't kind of grab on
the chapped areas of your lips either
the formula was definitely incredible
and I just really loved how they feel on
my lips they don't feel too heavy I
think the only downfall of these
lipsticks like I said it's just the
shape of the actual lipstick it's just
really hard to get a definition and
precision without getting that kind of
like smeared sort of look if that makes
sense
overall these were really cool I love
trying new things and I just love how
convenient these are you have literally
five different shades of lipsticks in
your palm like that is incredible let me
know down below what you guys think of
these lipsticks do you think they're a
bit of a gimmick or did you like the way
they looked and would you purchase them
yourself actually do wonder how many
uses you would get out of this if any of
you guys know roughly how many uses you
get out of a regular lipstick then I'm
pretty sure you could say that this is
like a quarter of that so I just thought
this I personally never actually finish
a big full-size lipstick there's always
a little bit left or even half left
sometimes and they just kind of expire
before I can use them all up but I feel
like these would be amazing for people
like me and maybe some of you guys who
don't actually use a whole lipstick and
then like all of it just goes to waste
pretty much because these ones you would
definitely get through quicker and you
wouldn't have so much wasted lipstick
that is all for this video thank you
