today I have yet another testing weird
beauty product kind of video and in
today's video I'm gonna be testing out
these spray-on a beauty product when I
saw these products online I was like
this is so cool so I just had to test it
out for you guys so all of these are
actually buy these Sephora
own brands so here I have a foundation a
bronzer which is actually like a darker
shade of foundation and then a blush as
well which I'm gonna be testing out in
this video for you guys if you guys
enjoyed this video make sure you smash
that huge thumbs up just down below and
also subscribe if you are brand new
because I would love to have you here
come and join the dinosaur family also
don't forget to find me on my social
media at rockstars on Instagram Twitter
snapchat
literally everything I have all of that
linked down below but without further
ado let's get on into the video okay so
first things first I purchased these
products obviously in Sephora in America
whilst I was in New York if you guys
haven't checked out my vlogs from New
York you totally should I'll link it
down below as well as the little eye in
the corner because adds so much fun and
I met Gigi Hadid again because I went
with Maybelline so it was really awesome
I had such a great time but basically
when I was there I saw these products on
the shelves in Sephora and I was like
this is so cool I really want to test it
out so I actually picked up at the
foundation I think this was about $28
and I think it's on sell on the website
at the moment I think it's like nineteen
dollars at the moment so I'll link that
down below if I can the actress shade of
foundation that I got is called Claire
light so this is it and basically you
meant to shake it and then just like
spray it on your skin just to disclaimer
I am wearing like eye makeup eyebrows
and lipstick but I'm not wearing like
anything on my actual skin and as you
can see I have like a few blemishes so
this is gonna be a good test to see how
good in coverage this is so I'm just
gonna go ahead and shake it and then I'm
just going to spread out my face I'm
kind of scared okay I'm gonna do it like
this kind of distance Oh
oh my god that smells really weird and
it's really picked up all of the hair on
my face I don't know if you guys can see
but that's really picked up all of like
my peach fuzz on my face so I'm
definitely gonna have
blend this in with a brush okay I'm
gonna go in for round two and see if I
can get it more even okay that looks a
lot better it's kind of like hard to
apply I don't think this product would
be good for people with asthma because
I'm like coughing and I don't even have
a cement just from like inhaling this oh
you have to be super careful not to
inhale this I feel like that's kind of
just taking up on my skin a little bit I
don't know if that's just like in the
texture of my skin I don't really have
too much hair on my face but it kind of
looks like I don't know it's not really
doing too much it's not really covering
my blemish if that makes sense
I'm gonna try and go a little bit higher
and also applies them to my forehead and
just to see what that will look like oh
my god it's so cold Oh
oh my god no this looks horrendous do
you guys see that that is actually all
for what is going on here I'm just
trying to blend this out with my brush
and it's going really weird do you guys
see this what is that that's so weird
this brush is like clean nothing's on it
I don't really know what's up with that
it's kind of ruined my eye makeup
obviously I would naturally do this like
before I apply any like I makeup I would
obviously do this kind of like first
before anything else so obviously I kind
of expected my makeup to get ruined but
I did not expect this like what
patchiness to happen we're not trying to
blend this out and it's kind of really
getting in my hairline as well which is
really annoying I don't know if I'm
liking this product so far guys I mean
it was $28 and for $28 I can get a
pretty good foundation that doesn't make
me look like this I kind of feel like
this foundation may be a gimmick I don't
really know what's up with it like it's
made my hairline
really weird because obviously it's
really gone into the hairline and then
when I'm trying to blend it out it just
goes really weird like white do you guys
see this with my being said once I blend
it out it actually looks pretty nice on
my skin it's kind of gone rid of my
blemish right here it's made my skin
tone look really nice and even but it
does look like I am wearing a lot of
foundation I have to say bright I'm
gonna try and do the other side so wish
me luck I feel like that looks a little
bit better
again it's gotten in my hair and just
look at that why does it go such a weird
color when I try and blend it okay so so
far I really like how it looks once it's
already applied on the skin I think it
looks like a really nice even coverage
but the thing that really annoys me is
the fact that I get it in my hair and
especially now that I've got darker hair
it really just gets into that hair line
and makes it so much light out it looks
really weird I guess you could get
around this by like holding your hand in
place of where your hairline is and kind
of prevent it from going in your hair
but everybody got time for that
I have to say initially I wasn't really
too pleased with the foundation and how
it looks but now that I'm looking closer
I feel like it does look really nice
it's kind of creasing quite a lot in my
lines but overall I feel like it looks
really nice and like healthy and fresh
so I'm now gonna move on to at the
contour so for this I'm literally just
using a darker shade of the same
foundation the shade I'm using is called
amber which is like this really nice
kind of warm bronzed shade and we're
gonna be trying to create like her nice
sense of contour with this and I don't
know how easy this is gonna be since
this is a spray again but we're gonna
try I know this is the foundation it's
not meant for bronzing but the lady in
Sephora said that it could also be used
as contour so we're gonna try it out and
see if it works I'm just going to very
lightly spray it just one line down my
cheekbones
Oh whoa that is very pigmented okay
let's this is so weird why does it do
that the one downside is that it's
really getting in my leg baby hairs by
my ear and that's really annoying so
this is ending up looking really patchy
and just really I don't know just really
bad okay so this is literally a
completely disaster I don't know if I
use that right maybe I added too much
but it's looking super patchy and I
can't really blend this in let's try it
on the other side I'm gonna add a little
bit less and see if that works any
better I'm literally just gonna do like
one dot let's see if we can blend this
out my hair is getting all in it okay
well this side looks a lot better then
at this side so I'm gonna take this side
off and redo it completely okay so I've
redone that my base on this side and
again I'm just gonna take the darker
foundation shade and just literally add
the tiniest bit of this to my cheek bone
that's literally all you need because
we're gonna blend this out and it's
gonna be super intense anyways you can
obviously build this up if you feel like
you haven't added enough but I feel like
it's so much easier to start with less
and then build up rather than trying to
remove all the product that I applied at
the beginning and like I said you
definitely want to do this is like the
first step of your routine because it's
obviously going to kind of mock up your
eye makeup like it has for me okay so
now my base is finished my foundation in
my contour I feel like there is a lot of
like discoloration kind of peeking
through especially around my eyes
because I didn't get too close to that
obviously if this isn't enough coverage
for you especially under the eyes you
can totally go in or with a concealer
which is what I'm gonna do to get rid of
any discoloration I'm just gonna go in
with my Becca concealer and I'm just
gonna pop that on any areas that I
couldn't really cover with the actual
spray-on foundation I think that is a
really big deal breaker for me is the
fact that it gets in your hair and you
can't really control that unless you
like have a shield like this but
obviously if you're holding like a
mirror
it's kind of really difficult to do that
the foundation it sounds like a really
nice skin light kind of a texture it's
very like satiny not too jewy but not
too matte so overall I think I give it a
thumbs up and now the last step is of
course the blusher so this shade is
actually called such a peach there was
another one that I really liked and it
was like orange a kind of tangerine
shade but they didn't have it in stock
so I went for this one instead I really
like this color anyway so I'm just gonna
add the tiniest bit of this onto my
cheek like right on the apple of my
cheek and hope to know that this isn't
gonna ruin the rest of my makeup this is
so scary where I'm gonna test it out
first okay nothing's coming out oh my
god it's literally broken why is it
broken every time I try and drop my
cheek I think I got a dodgy one because
it sprays like one spray and then it
just doesn't work after that there we go
that's actually quite pretty I like that
it's come a little bit patchy but I'm
sure once we blend it in it's gonna look
a lot better but that is the finished
blusher I really like the color but I
feel like it's quite hard to apply it
really precisely to one part of your
face I feel like it's kind of blended
down all the way out here because it was
just so easy to kind of like spray it
everywhere and not really concentrate it
in one area of your face I do really
like the color though I think it's very
pretty I just feel like if you do decide
to use these products you have to have
kind of a little bit of skill to be able
to place them in the right kind of area
of your face
as the finish result though I feel like
this is a really nice like healthy kind
of look I feel like it's a very
minimalistic look but it's very like
flawless it's made my skin really really
nice and even in color it was kind of
hard to blend at first like my first go
with the bronzer it was a bit of a
disaster I'm not gonna lie but you kind
of have to just learn to work a tiny bit
at a time rather than going
at the same time once I started adding a
less product it was way easier to blend
everything together and now I feel like
everything just really nicely cohesively
blends I feel like these products are
really cool to try out when I use them
every day probably not because they're
quite hard to kind of like work with if
I'm really in a rush I probably wouldn't
reach for these products but they are
very cool to own and to try out these
three products that cost me choir life
it ended up paying like $100 roughly for
them all so it is quite an expensive
thing if I was one of you guys and I
wanted to test these out for myself I
probably wouldn't buy all of them at the
same time I'd probably just experiment
with either like the foundation or the
actual blusher just to begin with to see
if it's like your kind of things you
definitely wouldn't want to expend all
your money on it and three other
products and then learn that you
actually don't even like them yourselves
so yeah that is all for this video I
really hope you guys enjoyed this let me
know if you guys are gonna try out these
products if you think it's worth the
money if you think it's more of a
gimmick I'm really not too sure myself I
certainly really enjoyed using the
products I think that's super fun so I
give them a thumbs up if you guys
