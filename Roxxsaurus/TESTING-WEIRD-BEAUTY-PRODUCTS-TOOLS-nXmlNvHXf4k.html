channel I hope you guys are well today
as you can tell from the title up there
I think I'm going to be testing out a
few beauty products as well as some
tools this time so it's gonna get super
intense I've already done one of these
videos where I was testing out the
peel-off lip tint so I'll leave that
down in the description below for you
guys if you're new to my channel and you
have never seen this face before be sure
to subscribe and subscribe button it's
just down below and also don't forget to
subscribe to my blog channel which is
called rocks or vlogs and if you are
doing this type of video please be sure
to give it a big ol thumbs up but
without poverty let's just go straight
into the video okay so the first thing
I've got here
is this little device and this is
actually a nose I don't know what to
call it to be honest it's a asian beauty
tool and basically what this is meant
for is putting it on your nose and
you're apparently meant awareness for an
extended period of time and it's meant
to make your nose more slender in the
long run and I have no idea how to
actually use this like I've had this for
quite a while but I guess you just clip
it on your nose like this I don't know
is that how you want to do it I think I
don't know it feels really really
strange I don't know but I look so
stupid right you imagine me walking down
to the street like hey look at my nose
DIY nose job over here yeah I don't know
if this would actually work I mean I
haven't worn it for an extended period
of time like you meant to but it feels
very uncomfortable on the nose so I
wouldn't recommend this does it work
though I think I spread it out let me
know in the comments if you have tried
this the next beauty tool I have is of
course the brush what is it called it's
kind of like an artiste artists you know
like a fake version of it but from a
different brand this is from the brand
etude house or etude house it's a Korean
makeup brand and it's called the my
beauty tool this is totally a remake of
the artiste brush I haven't actually
tried out each brush yet so I don't mind
using an old
- and see if this actually works so this
is what the brush looks like and it also
comes with a different head this is a
little sponge which you can attach on to
the end I assume so that's pretty cool I
don't think you get that with the artis
brush originally okay so I assume that
this is a foundation brush that I'm
gonna use my NARS sheer glow foundation
and just see how this blends each my
skin and if it's actually worth the hype
because why not just use a Beauty
Blender like I've been told that this
brush is apparently better than the
Beauty Blender but I don't know um okay
I'll just apply it here underneath my
lie I don't really know how you met to
use this image to swipe it or you meant
to like do circular motions I'm so
confused
like it's leaving weird strikes on my
face I have to say for my initial kind
of like first impression I don't think
it's worth it probably can't tell on
camera but this is leaving weird
brushstrokes on my face so I don't think
this is really great for blending at all
I'd rather use a Beauty Blender I guess
it's okay for blush but I don't think
that there's any reason why you should
buy this kind of brush instead of just
using a regular brush I wouldn't save
any better to be honest I'm not trying
to promote the Kylie lips at all I think
it's really dangerous so you have to
really be careful when you're using
things like this but because it's the
testing we have beauty products and
tools video I thought I can't miss these
out so here I've got two different sizes
of the full lips and these are basically
things that you put on your mouth you
create a suction between your lips and
the cup and it's meant to basically pull
all the blood to your lips and then town
make them a little bit more plump
I'm sadly going to have to remove my
lipstick okay so I've just removed my
lipstick as you can tell my top lip is
much smaller than my bottom lip so this
is the before shot
oh my god what is this okay it looks
like a cat's butthole not gonna lie I
don't know if I can tell the difference
like I've got so much higher poorness
and redness around my lips that can not
be good for my lips I'm annex bigger
though I mean they look a little bit
bigger but there's not like a dramatic
difference or anything I would say it
works but is it worth the pain I feel
like as girls we shouldn't have to go
through things like this in order to get
big lips I think we should just accept
how we look and there's always lip liner
that's what lip liner is for okay so the
next thing I'm testing is natural
products and this is the my lip patch
and this is a I think Korean lip mask I
think they're called and I have never
used a lip mask before I've used face
mask but never lip mask so this is what
it looks like
whoo so it's like a little lip shape
things it's really hard by the way guys
I just got fake nails and literally I
can't type I can't do anything with
these nails are so impractical okay so
I've got this little sheer layer of
whatever this is
it looks really strange it's really big
for my lips so I'm just gonna put it on
I guess oh creasing a bubble if I open
my mouth
okay so it's been about five minutes my
mouth area does feel really like
moisturized like I don't actually know
the point of this is it meant to get rid
of chapped lips as it meant to like
really moisturize your lips because my
lips still feel pretty chapped
but then again my lips are so chapped
there's like no going back but I it's
quite a cool thing like I I never
thought you could have like lip masks
imagine if you get like four nose masks
next or like an Ian mask and be so cool
someone needs to come up with it no yeah
I give this thing a thumbs up like I
really thoroughly enjoyed the process of
this it was kind of weird at first but I
liked it
okay the next thing I'm trying out is
these little finger puppets I think I
don't know what they are like they're
just so weird it's like little cotton
balls that you meant to put on your
fingers and massage your face with and I
don't know if you're meant to massage
your face with them when you're washing
your face I would assume so I don't know
if this is gonna work with my
fingernails now this is very strange
like very very strange I think I'm just
going to use two on my index and middle
finger I don't know what were meant to
do with these to be honest just what
what do I do
do I like massage my face they don't
feel nice and the last but not least is
the famous bubble carbonated clay mask
it looks like this let's get us open
with my long et nails no it's not
happening
I guess I can't open it guys okay I'm
totally gonna have to get my mom to open
this for me because I'm five okay she
opened it thanks mama
to remove my makeup just so that I can
test this on my skin and see how it
actually works
BRB okay it's going on oh it's very
gloopy like yeah very gloopy
kind of scared to go anywhere near my
eye because when it starts bubbling it's
gonna bubble into my eye
this color literally matches my life
it's like great I'm gray my hair is gray
just everything is gray gray is my
favorite color if you couldn't tell you
oh my god I haven't even finished
applying in it already bubbling ah okay
I'm going to give it a few minutes and
see how it goes okay so it's been about
three minutes and I just love this like
I feel so cute like my face is already
chubby now it's like all fluffy and
bubbly I don't know I'll just
up ignore me okay so let me show you
guys what it looks like close up this
has bubbled up so much and this side is
so so fuzzy I kind of want to touch and
see what it feels like I'm scared
ah spongy okay so it's all on my hand
now and I don't know what to do with it
to my skin after I have to say it feels
quite smooth I mean it doesn't feel like
amazing or anything it's just like
smoothness that any kind of mask would
give you I mean it's really fun for the
experience when it bubbles up but I
think it's actually like anything
special then again what do I know
buckskin not much so I want you guys to
let me know down below what you think of
this if you have tried it or if you want
to try it
