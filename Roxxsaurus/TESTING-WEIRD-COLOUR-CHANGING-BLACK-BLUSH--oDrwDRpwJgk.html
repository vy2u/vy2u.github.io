my lovelies in today's video I'm gonna
be testing out a really stranger beauty
product now I've never seen anything
like this before
so the product that I'm going to be
testing out today is actually a blush
that's black in color but then it turns
pink once it comes in contact with your
skin super weird if you guys enjoy these
types of videos with me testing our
weird and beauty products and make sure
to smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and also subscribe if you haven't
already I would love to have you here
come and join the dinosaur family also
don't forget to click the little Bell a
button next to the subscription button
to stay notified of every time I post a
new video but without more around
belaying and let's get on into the video
okay so I am very intrigued by this
little bad boy here so this is actually
from a brand called lipstick Queen I'm
pretty sure they've done like green
makeup in the past that changes pink
once it comes in contact with the skin
as well but this time but they went all
out and they actually created a blusher
that's pigmented like black like Alicia
it looks like a black eyeshadow so I'm
very intrigued to see if this will
actually work so I purchased this on
John Lewis comm and this was like 30
pounds so this is the little product
here and it's actually quite a small
blush I'm not gonna lie it's only 2
grams this is the blushing compared to a
standard Mac blush which is actually 6
grams so I mean in size it doesn't look
too different but I can definitely tell
that the pan is very thin and as you can
see the Mac blush is just way bigger I
think I paid like 30 pounds for it
online I'm plus shipping so yeah I'm
kind of interested to see how this will
why given that it was quite pricey and
there's not a lot of product inside and
said the blush itself actually has like
a tiny bit of a golden like sparkle
shimmer inside it which looks quite
interesting and also I feel like I catch
too little bit of the blush with my
finger and where I placed my finger it's
actually got a bit pink so that's really
strange
ok so I've just zoomed you guys in so
you can see my face a little bit better
and what's going on when I apply this
blush onto my face so I'm just gonna go
in
my real techniques a blush brush and
this is like my go-to blush brush so I'm
just gonna pick some of that up on the
on the brush oh my god it looks so weird
when I like pick it up oh my gosh it's
actually a cream product for some reason
I thought this was going to be a powder
product but it's not so it's really
interesting because on the brush it
actually looks pink but it has like a
black kind of undertone to it like it
always looks dark purple rather than
pink wow that's really interesting I
thought it was going to be black on the
brush but it's not okay so I guess here
it goes let's just apply it to my face
oh my goodness did you guys see that
that is a very vibrant pink try and
blend it out as much as possible I don't
know why it my head I imagined this to
be a powder product but I just did it is
such a pretty color do you guys see that
I'm gonna pick up a little bit more just
to see what happens it's so interesting
like on the brush is it just me or does
that look like dark purple rather than
pink that is so cool I'm just gonna pop
a little bit more of the blush Wow okay
that's really pigmented it's actually
really easy to blend out obviously I'm
doing it like a little bit over
exaggerating because I want it to pick
up on the camera but this is the color
overall and it blends out really super
well it almost like melts into the skin
which I'm very pleased about like when I
first apply it to my cheek it kind of
goes blotchy where I like first to dab
it on and it first comes in contact with
my skin but once I start blending it out
I have no issues blending it out and
getting a really nice even color I'm
probably gonna look back on this footage
and be like oh my god I applied way too
much but I really want you guys to be
able to see the color and how it looked
according to the website this blush is
actually meant to change colors
depending on like your skin tone so it's
supposed to be like the perfect pink
shade for you and depending on like the
pH balance of your skin or like the
warmth of your skin so I'm really
interested to see if this would be a
different color on other people or if it
would kind of change
color if my temperature change I don't
know so this is what it looks like up
close I feel like I managed to blend
that out really well I have no issues
with it at all and the color is so
pretty I feel like this is literally the
perfect color for my skin tone which
that's what the product claims it does
so so what are my thoughts on this
product I think I have to say it's
definitely a really pretty color it
applies super nice I'm really impressed
by the way it looks on my skin and it's
definitely like the perfect shade for me
which I was kind of worried about like
is it gonna be too dark or is it gonna
be too light for me I really had no idea
what kind of color this would turn into
cuz is pitch black but I feel like it's
done really well and the product
definitely is what it claims that it
does as for the price I mean it is kind
of pricey is 30 pounds I'm not too sure
about the conversion in other countries
but I feel like it's more of a high-end
blush but at the same time you could get
like a Chanel blush or like a wide sell
blush or a two-faced blush for that kind
of price it's not too you guys where you
guys want to spend your money whether
you want to spend it on like a brand
that's well-known or lipstick queen
which is right here
I feel like this blush could be a little
bit more you know affordable because it
doesn't really do anything that special
apart from the color changing thing
which is obviously more of like a
gimmick like it's nice to try it out but
do I need this for everyday or probably
not although it would be quite cool to
start applying and this black blush in
front of your friends and they'd be like
what the hell are you doing why are you
applying black to your cheeks
so just sum it out I actually think that
this product is really cool it's
definitely worth a try if you're you
know wanting to kind of be a bit more
adventurous with your makeup and try
something new it's actually a super
pretty color and I definitely rate it so
it's a big thumbs up for me let me know
down below what you guys think of
color-changing makeup do you think it's
like a gimmick do you think it's worth
buying and spending your money on I
don't like it's a lot of fun but I want
to know your thoughts down below also
let me know what kind of products you
would like me to test out next I

product lined up that I'm definitely
