hope you guys have an awesome day so far
so today is actually another testing
makeup product kind of video I have came
across there's a really weird makeup
product recently and it's basically
paper makeup I came across this product
on an article and I was literally blown
away by the concept like paper makeup
it's like weightless it's so compact
meaning that if this does actually work
it can change the future of makeup
especially for traveling because you
won't have to carry around like
different compacts and different pallets
are you pretty much would have your full
base in these little sheets which is
absolutely insane she's only on straight
into testing these little bad boys
please and give this video a thumbs up
if you enjoy these types of videos and
you would like me to do more testing or
with products in the future and also
don't forget to subscribe if you have
read me because I would love to have you
here come enjoyed the dinosaur family
also don't forget to subscribe to my
daily volume channel called rocks or
vlogs as long as that don't forget to
click the a little bow button down below
to get notified every time I post a
video but without going to do let's get
into the video so in today's video we
are going to be testing out the my
Couture powder paper makeup so basically
right here I have the nude to glow
foundation as well as that I also have
the glow trio which includes a bronzer
highlight and blush all in one little
packet which is pretty neat so the
concept of this makeup is that you can
take this on the go and you can touch up
or do your makeup with these little
sheets and on top of them on top of
every single sheet there is a layer of
powder of each of the makeups who have
the bronzer the highlight and the blush
so this is what they kind of look like
this such a weird concept the only thing
it does say about these on the website
is the fact that these aren't going to
replace brushes so if you have these you
are still going to need to take brushes
around with you which kind of defeats
the point was like on the go because
you're still having to blend it out
somehow but at the same time I guess is
a lot better than having to carry it
around like a full bag of makeup with
you when you can just carry these around
instead what you're supposed
meant to do is rip out a sheet of the
make up product you want to use and just
blot it and pass it on to your skin as
you kind of would with a beauty blender
but instead you use a sheet to kind of
deposit the product onto your face okay
so I'm going to start off with the
foundation because I'm a really
intrigued how this is going to go so
this is what the foundation sheets look
like they are quite far from my natural
skin color but on the website I felt
like this one's the closest shade to my
natural skin tone so I'm going to zoom
you guys in so you can see my face okay
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to take one of the sheets from
the foundation booklet and you can use
one sheet for an entire face so let's
see let's see how far this will go okay
so I'm going to pull one sheet out which
was pretty easy enough let's take this
bad boy for a spin
I have no idea if this is working at all
I can definitely tell it's taken away
the oil off of my face
but has it really covered anything I'm
not so sure I have a few spots right
here on my chin and it doesn't really
seem to be doing anything for that I
feel like is making it more prominent
but I don't have perfect skin and it's
really cleaning onto my pores and my
hairs on my face which isn't something
that I personally look for in a
foundation not going to like what you
guys think I feel like this is literally
done nothing which is kind of what I
expected from a powder foundation like
that I knew it was going to be more of a
powder rather than a coverage foundation
so I don't know I don't know I feel like
this is just technically a blotting
paper to get rid of the oil and it has a
little bit of powder on top but it is
something I would pay like 15 pounds for
which I'm pretty sure that's how much I
paid for it on Amazon okay so I've got
another sheet right here and I'm just
gonna pass it on to my skin this time
rather than buff it I can't visually see
any difference and northern alive okay
so my overall verdict of the powder
foundation it literally has no coverage
at all you can still see all of my
blemishes on my skin or my chin right
here and you can see my under-eye
circles so there is definitely no
coverage in the foundation apple which
is kind of what I expected from a powder
foundation anyways like I said I just
definitely feel like this is not worth
the money
I feel like this is literally just a
sheet a blotting sheet that has a layer
of powder over the top so yeah I
definitely would not pay 15 pounds for
this again because it's just kind of
useless in my opinion okay so I'm now
going to try the next Pat I have no idea
what to expect now because the
foundation was a big flop but this could
be different I feel like a lot of
products that I use on day to day basis
are already powder so I
like this can't be that bad right right
here's me hoping for the best but we
will see the fat so I'm going to take
the bronzing sheet I'm just taking one
ripping it out of the booklet there I'm
just gonna kind of roll it around one
finger like this for more precision and
I'm literally just going to go in that's
not bad I guess it is okay
pigmentation is definitely there so I'm
already a hundred percent more impressed
with this product it's going to go into
the temple I feel like that not too bad
you know the color so far looks slightly
orange but I'm sure we can sort that out
I wouldn't rather it be a little bit
more cool toned but I'm not going to
complain too much about that because the
product is definitely really pigmented
and once it's all blended out it's
actually not that bad I think it looks
still quite nice and natural and
sunkissed you guys I'm actually really
impressed with the bronzer and how it
looks when it's blended out and look how
much product there is still left on this
little shade there is like a still sore
much left so I feel like this one little
sheet goes a really long way which is
really good because you could just rip
out a half of the sheet from the booklet
and not have to use the whole thing
because this definitely goes a long long
way so now it's the moment of truth
I'm now going to be reaching for the
highlighter sheet I'm really excited
about this because I love highlights I
like you guys if you've been watching my
channel for a while you'll know that I'm
a set of highlighter so this is really
exciting because if you can have
highlighter on the go your life or will
be complete I tell you it's kind of like
this gold toned highlight I feel like
this will be really pretty if it's a
pigmented as the bronzer one okay are
you guys ready for this
Oh oh my gosh that is really pretty
I have to say it's quite orange like you
can see a streak of orange on my face
right now but once I blend it out I'm
sure we'll be okay yes it looks exactly
like it does on the sheets though so I
can't really complain okay so this is
what the highlight looks like once it
blended out it still looks very orange
on the tip of my nose though and I don't
really know what to do about that I'm
trying to blend out as much as possible
but I just can't seem to get that
pigment off it's like engraved on my
nose now so you guys are gonna have to
deal with that for the rest of the video
but the highlight does look really
pretty it's kind of lost that orangey
pigment once you blend out on your
cheekbone so now the last point there is
to try is the blusher so this is a very
nice pinky toned blush I don't know if
this is going to do my kind of shade but
this is what came in the little booklet
so we gotta make do guys we've got me do
so I'm gonna first that bad boy out and
just apply this to my cheeks so what you
meant to do is this is just dab it onto
your cheek so that's exactly what I'm
going to do is I doing anything can you
guys see anything oh my god I actually
really like that such a natural like
flush to the cheeks I love that shade I
didn't think it would really be my shade
but what is on the skin I think it looks
beautiful so this is what the makeup
looks like I think she looks pretty good
I'm not gonna lie the only thing that I
didn't really like is the foundation
which I feel like I'm sorry bare without
it and like I've got so many leg
blemishes and spot on show so yeah the
foundation is definitely a big no-no
from me I would never ever recommend it
to you guys but I do really like this
which is the bronze highlight and blush
that is the end of this video and this
is the final result I fill in my
highlight is pretty popping my bronzer
looks really
and sunkissed and my blush looks very
much useful and flushed which I really
like so I definitely would recommend
this product here I would definitely not
recommend the powder foundation just
because even if she does nothing for my
skin it made like my facebook free cakey
which I definitely did not like but let
me know down below what you guys think
of these products if you would like to
try them at any point cuz I feel like
they're quite good for like on the go I
don't think I personally would use them
when I was at home because I have so
many other better products that I love
but yeah on the go I feel like why not
you would like me to do any more of
these weird testing beauty products in
the future let me know down in the
comments below your suggestions and what
product I should try next if you guys
did enjoy be sure to smash that key
