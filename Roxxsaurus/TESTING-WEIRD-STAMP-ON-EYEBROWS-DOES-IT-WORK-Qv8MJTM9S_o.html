channel I hope you guys have an awesome
day though internet video I'm going to
be testing another weird beauty tool
flash product and today I'm going to be
testing the brow stamp by the brand
I envy bye kiss I saw this little
product on the internet like a few days
ago and I have to buy it because I just
wanted to really test this to see if it
actually work I'm pretty intrigued
because this is like a one fits all kind
of deal
you only get one stamp of one shape so I
don't know if it's going to work at all
this might be a complete fail but I
thought why not try out - you guys don't
have to you guys are new to my channel
like don't forget to subscribe because I
would love to have you here join the
dinosaurs family and I'm supposed twice
a week so make sure you guys are done
myself if you guys enjoyed this video be
sure each my fake you sums up just down
below but without further adieu and
let's get into the video so inside the
box what you get is the actual product
which is in like this little brown
container and you also get two eyebrow
stamps which look like a Zeus I don't
think it's my brow shape at all so this
could go very wrong okay so on the back
of the packaging it says step 1 be sure
your skin is moisturized with primer or
liquid foundation done not already
indexed to pad on the pressed powder
with the stamp so this is the power to
guys I think that's a pretty close match
to my eyebrows but we'll see you will
see ok so I'm going to take the stamp
for my right eyebrow first and just dump
that in there I'm going to go quite hard
there's barely any product on this thing
and I press hella hard through I don't
know what that's about
I'm going to go in for a second press
and see if it makes any difference ok
well there's a little bit more but still
not really anything that I think would
actually deposit onto my actual brow so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
kind of push it and always scrape the
product off ok that's working a lot
better so you kind of don't press it you
kind of scrape it and pass at the same
time there we go there's actually some
product on here now so hopefully you're
like right guys I'm going to zoom you in
a little bit so you can see
my eyebrows I'm going to take this stamp
and I'm going to press it under my
eyebrow I'm a little bit scared to be
honest I don't know how to do this right
okay compressing it on you know how long
to hold it on there for and how hard to
press I'm going to try and press really
hard just to give it a fair test oh okay
that is a slope of my face definitely
works however my tail of the brow isn't
really aligned I don't know if that was
my fault or if it's the fault of the
stump but I don't think that the actual
stump is following the shape of my brow
I'm going to try and do my left one and
see if it's any better about I'm taking
at my product again brush this on we're
really straight the product off onto the
sponge I think that this would be quite
a big thing for people who don't have
any eyebrows like if they've plucked it
or reflux it then possibly this could be
good because then there's no shape to
actually follow when you have no brows
so that would be useful for people who
don't have round however for me I
already have a shape and this really
isn't helping it's a little right guys
I'm going to try my second brow and I'm
going to do it a little bit lower
pressing that on now we'll see how it
looks
um this is not what it looks like on the
commercial what is this guy's do you see
this tails why is that like that I'm
just baffled by this product in theory
this should work I have no idea why it's
not I think this part of my brow was
covered fine I've placed it exactly on
the beginning of my brow and there's no
like overlaying of anything but it's
just the wing I really like what they
were trying to do with this I like the
idea but for me I just don't think it
works at all I'm going to take these
brow up and I'm going to try and give
this product the benefit of the doubt
because I feel like this could just be
my failure to use the product so if I'm
struggling to use this product probably
no with other people would be able to
use this any better than I can but I am
going to give it a second go and see if
I can make the flag I think I ordered
this product for about 15 pounds on
Amazon so it's not super expensive at
the same time you can get so many
eyebrow products for the same price and
they are attributes super good like
high-end brow products right so I'm
passing the product into the powder
again I have to say although these
stamps aren't amazing I feel like the
powder is a really nice color which you
could use anyways even if the stamps are
not for you but for just the powder I
don't think I would spend like 15 pounds
when I can easily get a high end product
ok so I'm just going to align the arch
and I'm going to press the rest see if
that makes any difference when I apply
the arch first in my actually make a
look at that tiny bit better and a
little bit more accurate okay Wow guys
okay I'm not mad about it I'm actually
quite impressed this bit here is a
little bit like fuzzy so it's not very
sharp but I'm sure you can easily clean
up the rest oh my gosh that is actually
really good I'm actually pleasantly
surprised I take everything back that
I've just said this part here is really
nice like crisp line kind of like the
fade brows on Instagram know when you
kind of clean up your edge with a
concealer this basically does that but
without concealer which is really good
it has definitely worked around this
part of my brow is really nicely filled
in it's a really nice solid color
however the kind of tail of my brow is
still a little bit sparse so you
definitely would need to touch that up a
little bit right I'm going to try and do
the same with the other brow hopefully
in the school work right I'm going to
place down the arch first and then the
rest
my iPhone have seen better days you guys
this one was a bit of a fail don't
really like detail and it hasn't really
filled in this part of my brow as much
as this one day I'm just going to try
and go over this area of my brow again
I'm only really pressing into this area
here and not really touching my tail of
the brow okay I feel like this could
quite easily be fixed though so it's not
that bad I was much more impressed or
this eyebrow here
it's definitely worked so so well on my
dominant eyebrow but it is still felt
terrible it looks a little bit like a
slug but I'm sure I could clean up quite
easily overall I think I give this
product like a 6 out of 10 I feel like
this I definitely had worked the second
time around it's definitely a product
but you kind of have to get used to is
it worth the money I don't think it is I
mean the powder is a great color at very
cool toned it is quite a big pot in here
as well to get a lot of product
however the sponge is just a bit of a
gimmick
I think arrows aren't as hard to do as
for example eyeliner so I don't think
you kind of need a stencil for your
eyebrows you can definitely do it
freehand and still make it look amazing
even if you're not amazing and makeup
and you are a beginner I'm sure you
could still do your eyebrows better than
this little sponge curd as much as I
hated the product at the beginning I
feel like after seeing how this brow
turned out I do kind of like it and I do
like the packaging as well with a little
brow sponges stamp things kind of sort
in the top as you can see and then the
products kind of opens up like this it's
quite cute little design when I use this
on a daily basis probably not actually
definitely not because I can definitely
do my eyebrows better than a little
one-size-fits-all sponge can though I
think that for the price I would much
rather put a few more pounds towards
like a dip brow pomade or something like
that what do you guys think of this
product let me know down below and also
if you would like me to try any other
products like this or like
I've also seen like an eyeliner stamp
and I've really been wanting to try it
but you can only get it in America so
I'm trying to find a way to kind of get
it shipped over to the UK for me so I
could try it for you guys
if there's really a thumbs up if you
would like to see that on this channel
because it looks really cool I do really
want to try it for you guys but yes that
is all for this video I really hope you
guys like this short little testing out
this product right here let me know your
thoughts I'll need brows what do you
guys think are you guys willing to try
this product also don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't already I was
much to have you come and join the
dinosaur family but that is all from me
