today I am so excited because I'm gonna
be testing out a very strange beauty
product if you guys have been on this
channel for quite some time you all know
that I love trying new highlighters I've
tried out the putty highlighter a while
back if you guys haven't seen that video
I'll link it in the I just that but it
was such a cool highlighter so when I
saw this one I was like I have to test
that out
so the highlighter I'm gonna be testing
out today is by the brand called a fast
Sally I think that's how you pronounce
it you guys are probably going to be
quite familiar with this brand already
because this is huge on Instagram and
especially they're known for their like
serum drops that people use in their
like mini Instagram tutorials all the
time so last year in November they raced
in this new highlighter called jellybean
illuminator and this only comes in one
shade and that is called glaze so I
purchased this highlighter online and it
came all the way from America which is
surprisingly it didn't actually take
that long to ship I think it only took
like maybe five days or so which I was
very surprised by so the shipping winds
are very good and I paid like forty
seven dollars for this including
shipping so it is quite a pricey
highlight I'm not gonna lie I don't
usually buy high-end highlighters
because I feel like there's so many
great alternatives at the drugstore but
for the sake of this video I really
wanted to pick this up because I just
know this will be such a cool product to
try out for you guys this is the product
and what it looks like inside it's
actually quite a small container like
the pan is very thin from what I can see
but the packaging is very pretty it's
just like a gold top that says fast Ally
on it and it says the jellybean
illuminator as you can see from the pan
it's gonna be such a beautiful color and
here so literally I'm opening this for
the first time and I'm actually quite
scared I don't really know what to
expect
oh my god it's like moving in there look
at that that is sick oh my god look at
that it's like bloody moving inside the
pan so fast these are try it out I'm
just gonna use my fingers just to see
how it performs with just a warmth of my
fingers I'm just gonna pop my finger in
whoa
that's so cool
you guys see that the consistency of
this is so interesting that I has picked
up a lot of the products I'm just gonna
swipe some off so I don't waste any okay
so it seems you guys just in a little
bit and I'm now just gonna pop this onto
my cheekbone I'm actually really nervous
I have no idea how intense this girl up
because on my finger it looks pretty
intense okay here I go
whew that is blinding oh my goodness how
am I gonna blend this out I feel like
I've added way too much tighting foam
but we're just gonna roll with it I'm
gonna use a different finger to try and
blend this in okay so it's kind of going
a little bit bitty and patchy on my skin
I'm not really too sure why that is
maybe it's just because we haven't
blended it in properly just yet it
blends quite easily but I know that
products like this tend to dry quite
quickly so I'm gonna try and work my way
in as quick as I can because we
obviously don't want a stripe of
highlighter on my face right now I'm not
really liking the texture as much as I
thought I would and maybe that's just
because I'm applying it with my finger
it's kind of clinging to those dry spots
of my face and not really giving my skin
justice but I'm gonna keep blending and
see what I think afterwards okay so this
is it fully blended out into my
cheekbone what do you guys think I kind
of feel like everything I initially said
about it becoming quite dry and bitty
and kind of clinging onto those dry
spots of my face just completely
disregard that because it's actually
blended out super well it doesn't look
dry or patchy any longer now that I've
really took my time to blend it out with
my finger as for the color it is so
beautiful I feel like this color would
suit a lot of different skin tones or
for sure I'm really diggin it and I
really love how it looks in person but I
don't know I just on camera it just
doesn't really do it justice I'm gonna
try and blend this out maybe a little
bit with my beauty
just to see how it looks and how it
pairs with the rest of the makeup
because I feel like it's just made my
contour very patchy okay that's not
looking so bad now actually I feel like
that's really taking a 360 from how it
looks I mean just a little bit of
blending with a sponge really went a
long way I feel like the contour no
longer looks patchy after I blended it
out of the Beauty Blender I feel like
it's kind of become a part of the skin
now so it looks a lot better than it did
to begin with ah yeah I think that looks
really good now actually so now that we
know that this product works a lot
better with a Beauty Blender I think I'm
gonna try and blend the other side with
a Beauty Blender by itself I kind of
want to just dip my Beauty Blender and
there see what happens
oh did you guys see that guy's literally
makeup porn right back ok so I picked up
some of that product on my sponge so
here we go oh yeah that's the one this
product is coming through guys okay
so my verdict is that using a Beauty
blunder it's definitely giving you that
kind of like everyday glow whereas this
side it's just like full-on blinding go
friends I'm just gonna try and build
this up just a little bit did you guys
know I like my highlights its tippy
quite prominent so just gonna go in with
my finger and just add a little bit more
product right there and then just blend
that out with the Beauty Blender I'm
just gonna take a little bit of that
product on the very tip of my Beauty
Blender I'm gonna use this as my nose
highlight its I'm actually quite
intrigued as to how this all work on the
tip of the nose
just gonna blend that in with my finger
actually okay
I am literally left with a 10-month nose
right now it's not blending out guys
okay I take it back it's all good it's
all good this highlight is literally so
pretty I just kind of want to make my
whole face it oh this is what the face
looks like highlighted honestly I think
this product has definitely come through
it towards the end of this video when I
first initially applied it to my face I
was kind of a bit skeptical I was like
why is it so patchy and it was to begin
with I was using my fingers I mean
usually I haven't got a problem with
using my fingers to blend out makeup
products like contour highlight I feel
like it's actually a lot better than
brushes in some cases but for this I
just feel like it wasn't working it was
kind of really clinging to the patches
of my face to begin with then I kind of
blended it a little bit more and it was
working a lot better but still I just
feel like the Beauty Blender took the
crown for this one I am obsessed with
how this looks on the skin it's just
such a pretty glow and of course like I
said you can either have it really super
blinding or you can have it quite
natural and subtle like you guys saw on
this side at first I just think that
this product is so cool mostly for the
texture it's just something I have never
seen before in a highlighter obviously
before we finish this video I'm gonna
give you guys a little highlight swatch
on the arm just cuz I feel like wow that
is so pretty okay wait I need a little
bit more I need a little bit more whoa
okay
yeah there it is so that was the far
sunny highlighter and I honestly was
quite skeptical when I first tried this
I was a bit like is it really worth the
money bear in mind you only get 15 mil
in this pot and it is quite expensive
I spent what 47 did I say 47 dollars or
something like that including shipping
so it is definitely on the high-end
price point but for the amount of
product that you use to get this kind of
effect
you only need as a tiniest drop and a
little goes definitely a long way if you
guys feel like that that is way too much
money for a highlighter of this kind
there is definitely so many drugstore
alternatives out there which are just as
blinding and just as beautiful as this I
think with this highlighter you're
definitely paying for like the gimmick
of it and how cool it is also the
packaging and just the fact that it also
has fasoli like skincare inside it
because far sorry I'm mostly known for
skin care products so they've actually
included some skincare of theirs into
this highlighter - the extra
moisturizing and all that good stuff so
yeah those were my thoughts on the far
side highlighter I do want to know what
you guys think of this so let me know
down below in the comment and also if
you guys have any suggestions on what
weird products I should try out next I'm
always open to suggestions so let me
