channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far but infinite video as
you can see for the title of them
talking about my ten top highlighters of
all times these are the kind of
highlighters that are going to make you
look like a glazed donut flash visible
and that's exactly what we want there
will be a mixture of high-end as well as
drugstore highlighters in this video so
I'm really really excited to share them
with you guys
as always if you guys enjoy this video
make sure you smash a few thumbs upses
down below and also subscribe if you
haven't already but without further ado
let's get into the video okay so the
photo hyaline huh I have to talk about
this one because I'm actually wearing it
on my face at the moment and you're all
probably wondering why I'm wearing so
this gorgeous highlighter that I'm
wearing it actually the Anastacio glow
kit I have seen it so many people talk
about this bad boy all over Instagram
and YouTube honestly I'm just really
surprised why I haven't tried this to me
because it has literally changed up my
highlighter game so in here you get four
different shades which is perfect for
different skin tones I am mostly in
favor of these two because they match my
skin tone better and I'm actually
wearing this shade here which is called
summer this is genuinely the most
pigmented champagne highlighter I've
ever tried it is just so so smooth and
so creamy I honestly am in love with it
I hope this palette for 38 pounds I
think on beautybay which when you think
about it in the grand scheme of things
it's not a lot because you do get four
different highlighters in here which are
really good quality
I wouldn't definitely hands-down
recommend this palette because it is so
so good like it's just so creamy and the
shadows are really really pigmented I'm
gonna swatch it for you guys real quick
just look at that every single
highlighter is just as pigmented as the
other not only use the products of
really good but the packaging let's just
say it's very Instagram herbal now for
the next most blighting highlighters I
am definitely a fan of the sleek salted
highlighter this is a drug for
alternative which makes it so accessible
to everyone and I kinda feel like this
is a really nice alternative for the
glow kit because you also get four
different shadows in here obviously
these are like different colors and
pigments and stuff but all in all these
are just as pigmented as
okay and these are drugstore and here
you also get a cream highlighter which
you can kind of put over your skin and
then set it in with one of these powder
highlighters
every time I've worn this highlighter I
get lots of compliments in public and
from you guys so I'm definitely a fan of
this point I would definitely recommend
it as when my top of drugstore
highlighted the third highlight I'm
going to talk about it by the brand
called rodeo now I'm looking to familiar
with this brand until I actually got
sent a few products into my PA box from
them and since I've tried them I have
been using this highlighter like crazy
this highlighter is like the perfect
example of golden slash champagne kind
of color it's really good for my type of
skin tone as well as any kind of like
deeper skin tones because it does have
that light warmth to it again really
really creamy it's not chalky Apple it's
just like the perfect glow you can wear
it as quite a bold color as well as
really natural and subtle it's just kind
of whichever one you prefer this one is
a really buildable as well which I
really like and this has definitely been
one of the highlighters I've been
reaching for most every day the
packaging is also really really nice
it's got an hour on it for royal but
left to say it are four rocks or no all
know now this net highlighter is another
drugstore one and I have definitely used
it in a couple of my tutorials as well
as like dukes videos because it is a
dupe for a lot of different popular
highlighted and it's this one here
called revolution it's the vivid baked
highlighter this probably cost around
three pounds in the drugstore which is
absolutely amazing
the quality of this highlighter in to
die for you would not expect the kind of
quality from a free pound highlighter
but it is really creamy really soft not
chalky at all again it's that perfect
kind of champagne cool tote highlighter
so those of you who do like a more cool
toned highlighter I'm definitely a fan
of this kind of shade of highlight but
for those of you who have a more deeper
skin tone there are also different shade
from this range and they have like
golden ones as well as bronze ones so
there's something for everyone and I'm
just blown away by how good this
highlighter is for the price this
highlight
was actually a dude in one of my duke's
videos for this highlighter which is
also a one of my top 10 and this is the
Mesa Provo high lifetime is very very
similar in shade as you can see here
obviously this one is fraction of the
price so if you do not have the money to
splurge on a highlighter this expensive
you can oil ups for this one and as much
as I love this one I kind of feel like
this one from revolution is actually a
little bit more blinding even if I go to
fit in at my dupe video when I compared
side by side so even though this one is
a little bit more blinding and more out
there I feel like this one is still a
little bit better on the terms of how it
went and a highlight I'm going to talk
about is another drugstore one this one
you guys know I absolutely love this is
the Maybelline destroy being liquid
liquid highlighter this one is actually
in the shade light iridescent which is
my absolute favorite it's just so easy
to apply it's also really really
affordable which makes it so much more
accessible than a lot of the high-end
highlighters out there this is literally
how much you need when you apply it to
your face so pigmented as you can see it
is just such a beautiful Sheen to the
skin because it is a liquid highlighter
is very versatile meaning you can blend
into your skin you can also mix it into
your foundation for that really subtle
glow you can actually use this as a base
for other highlighters if you want to
set this without powder highlight that
it would literally make your highlight
pop right to the moon and also a really
good benefit of a liquid highlight is
that it's amazing for people who are dry
skin because it's not going to settle
into like the cracks of your dry skin
I'm moving back into the highest fear of
highlighters I definitely have to
mention it Bernard Copacabana this is
definitely a cult beauty products for a
lot of youtubers and just bloggers in
general I definitely have had a lot
about this product in my time on YouTube
is definitely one of the best
highlighters that are liquid and also
kind of like pearlescent shimmery
champagne kind of color it is very
similar to the previous product I've
just showed you as you can see it's a
very similar glow so if you guys that do
not have
the money to splurge on an art product
you can definitely opt for the
Maybelline one because it is just as
great describe it so lightweight it
makes you feel like creep on your face
it doesn't even feel like a highlighter
so that is definitely why I love it and
of course for the blindness if you're
out one night and you were getting
robbed and you just like turned your
cheek you would definitely blind the
robber and you'd be fine now another
really awesome directional highlighter
that I've been loving recently is the
new NYX duo chromatic illuminating
powder it looks like this it's just such
a beautiful blinding highlighter this is
from a tenuous spring range and I
absolutely love it it has this really
nice well zero chromatic sheen to it so
when you apply it to your face
it kind of has like a nice double kind
of color to it this problem is it's so
damn pigmented it like when you apply to
your feet are like what I can't see my
own but all in all and this is
definitely one of my most kick-ass and
drugstore highlighters one it's
affordable and - I mean just listen
isn't it beautiful
now the next product I'm gonna talk
about is actually a highlighter from
Laura Mercier this is called deep face
illuminator in shade devotion it is the
most prettiest highlighter and I've ever
seen on this planet if I can marry a
highlighter this would be the worst of
all the packaging is to die for
look at that face a work of art in one
sentence I basically just wanna bathe in
this highlighter and put it all on my
face Laura Mercier is a little bit on
the pricey side but you do get what you
pay for the quality is just amazing the
longevity of this product is definitely
what you are paying for because it does
a lasts like all day I'm telling you and
of course that one more thing you'll pay
for is for how attractive and this
highlighter is and a lot of highlights
I'm going to show you guys is the Urban
Decay afterglow 8 hour powder
highlighter
requite like this highlighter so much is
because I don't actually own a very many
pinky highlighters there's a sign of the
highlighter is very simple the pan is
just flat but when you actually apply
the highlighter on your face you can see
why I love this
the pink isn't even as noticeable
anymore but it still has that kind of
slight undertone to it I think it's
honestly really beautiful for pale
complexions but I think honestly it
would suit any kind of complexion
environment the packaging love the
highlighter and that will play no matter
how small the highlighter is as well
meaning you can really slip it into your
makeup bag and it's just very travel
friendly okay I know I said that was a
lot I lied but I lied I can't not
mention this one because it's just so so
beautiful so here I am I'm adding in the
leathers highlight to my cheeky ten list
of highlighters don't tell everyone the
last one I'm going to mention is the Too
Faced candle light highlighter I think
this is a no-brainer it's genuinely just
such a beautiful highlight but every
single day it definitely is popping and
it's really really pretty for any skin
tone hiding is genius
I was really under fan of Too Faced
product and honestly whenever I use this
product I kind of just feel like a
princess I'm not gonna live so this was
my list of 10 most lighting highlights
from the drugstore as well as high-end
plus a cheeky one that I did not plan
for by the packaging you guys that last
one I really hope you guys enjoyed this
slightly different video from me I would
love to do more of like this little
serie I'd love to maybe do one about
liquid lipsticks because they are
definitely kind of like hit and miss
sometimes so if this video goes down
well and you guys like it I would love
to make a lipstick one for you guys if
you did enjoy the video as always and
