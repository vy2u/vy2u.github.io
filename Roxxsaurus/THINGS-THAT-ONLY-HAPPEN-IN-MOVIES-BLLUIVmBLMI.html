channel I hope you guys all well today I
have a video for you guys that is all
about things that only happen in movies
are so many cliches that happen only in
movies and never in real life I thought
this would be a fun little video to film
for you guys so we can sort of just
address these things and how they're so
unrealistic you guys enjoy this video
please be sure to give a huge thumbs up
and subscribe to this channel if you're
new also this video is in collaboration
with my boyfriend Matt he did things
that don't happen in horror movies which
is so so funny I love that video so much
so I'll link that in the description
down below you can also click the little
I I think it's in this corner or is it
this one I'm pretty sure it's this one
so if you click that Matt's video will
be down there as well ok so without her
ado let's jump straight into the video
so the first thing that only happens in
movies is when people go and investigate
the weird noise in their house so if I
hear a bang they're going investigate
and they call out hello like what do you
think is going to happen she's rehabbing
can't do a call we still have the issue
you
hello and your buddy there oh it's just
me the serial killer I guess this is the
point where I could miss people almost
deserve to die because they're just so
silly
best thing that only happens in horror
movies is not turning on the light when
you wake up after you've heard a random
bang in your house like the light switch
is right there why would you not press
it it just makes everything so much less
scary just use the lights with it
honestly just turn the light switch on
just do it
the next thing that only happens in
movies is hanging up the phone without
saying goodbye it's so strange I don't
know why it happens like no one I know
in real life does that Oh movies it goes
a little something like this yeah I
haven't seen you in so long
yeah I know it's been a while so yeah
you have to come to that party time
okay I will do but in reality it's
something a little bit more like this so
yeah you have to come to that party
tonight okay I will do all right all
right okay okay all right okay bye all
right bye bye okay bye bye bye bye the
next thing that only happens in movies
is usually in chick flicks so when the
girls are having like a little makeover
night they take the geeky girl and
they're like okay we're going to take
off your glasses so she takes off her
glasses and majestically she's just like
this really attractive girl all right
let's give you a makeover
first things first take off their
glasses okay hold on see it's so much
better it's just so unrealistic if I
wore glasses and I took them off I'd
look exactly the same plus people who
wear glasses are attractive so I don't
know where that whole thing came from to
be honest the next thing usually happens
in rom-coms or romantic kind of movies
and it's when two characters are like
some in love with each other you can
tell and you just wanted to kiss because
you ship them so much so when they're
about to kiss and
moment is fine become the phone
interrupts it sorry I gotta get that
hello like as if that would happen at
that exact moment that would never
happen in real life
I think the directors of movies really
know how to play on our heartstrings
those are all the things that I think
only happened in movies they're some of
my favorites let me know your favorites
down below and also know down below if
any of these things have ever happened
to you in real life they've never
happened to me which is why it leads me
to believe that movies are so
unrealistic you guys enjoy this video
please be sure to give it a huge thumbs
up and subscribe to this channel also
make sure you head over to my channel
and watch the video we did over on there
and subscribe that is all from me I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day and
I'll see you very soon in my next video
bye
