channel today's video it's kind of
different to my regular videos I thought
today I would sit down and have a little
chat with you guys most of us here are
girls so I thought I would talk about
something really important and I hope
that I can be like your older sort of
sister sort of figure if you don't have
one just basically have a little chat
about like feminine hygeine periods all
that kind of stuff all the girly
troubles I know that talking about these
sorts of things can be kind of
embarrassing especially if you have to
talk to your parents or family or even
teachers
it just can be a little bit daunting so
I hope that I can be that sort of filler
for you guys where you can just watch it
you don't have to talk about it you can
just listen to me blabber on for fifteen
minutes and just learn everything you
need to know so for today's video I have
actually partnered with always and I'm
gonna be showing these tips with you
guys today about feminine hygiene and
also have to show you guys in one of the
products that they have specifically
designed for us girls to make our life
that a little bit easier if you guys
enjoyed this video and find it helpful
do you make sure you smash the huge
thumbs up just below and also don't
forget to subscribe if you are brand new
well without further adieu let's get on
into the video also display my I'm gonna
be using the word vagina in this video
quite a bit so and you guys get kind of
cringy about that just get over it
all of us girls have won so vaginal
discharge it's still kind of a taboo
topic and it honestly shouldn't be we
all go through it it's a normal process
in our bodies your lady bits are
actually really really amazing because
they basically clean themselves just
like eyes produce tears to get rid of
irritants in your eyes your lady bits
basically have glands that produce the
discharge to kind of maintain the
well-being of the downstairs area this
is completely normal and if you have
experienced this honestly you are not
alone every single woman goes through
this and it's totally normal I mean the
only time you should ever really worry
about it is that if it has like a really
strong like fishy smell then maybe have
an infection of some sorts so do make
sure you consult your doctor always have
it basically produced a product designed
for us girls to help us out so these are
the always daily singles to go at these
are basically panty liners with these
you can actually wear them every single
day so they're super thin they're really
comfortable to wear so you don't even
notice them in your underwear these are
super super thin and they're
very absorbent so they basically
absorbed your daily discharge any odor
and any like dampness as well so you
don't have to worry about it all day
long these are also dermatologically
tested so they are safe to use every
single day so the always dangerous
liners basically all come individually
wrapped they're super small and discreet
so you can literally pop them in your
purse your bag and they're really
convenient for on the go so this is what
these singles look like they're super
super tiny I actually have a few of
these in my bags and wallets just in
case you know I have teamed up with
always for this video they're actually
doing a little giveaway for you guys
where you can actually claim a sample
for free you can clean one of these down
below by using the link so you can
experience the freshness for yourself
and especially if you have never used a
panty liners before I really recommend
for you guys to try them out and see if
you like that the next tip I want to
talk about is pH balancing washes if you
guys didn't know every single vagina has
its specific pH balance so if you use
any perfume shampoos or you know shower
gel it's you whatever you use down there
it's actually super bad because it can
disrupt the natural pH balance of your
vagina so what you should actually do is
go out and get yourself a separate
intimate wash and basically just use
that to wash down there because
obviously you don't want to disrupt the
natural pH balance and this can cause
some side effects such as you know
rashes just in general infections and
things like that so you definitely don't
want that so yes there's a
super-important get yourself a pH
balancing intimate wash and that brings
me to my next point and that is to go
commando this could be a little weird to
some of you guys especially if you're so
used to sleeping in your underwear kind
of like I am but sometimes it's nice to
basically just sleep with no underwear
maybe just throw on some blues pajamas
instead especially if you're like me and
you wear tight-fitting clothing all the
time throughout the day it is so
important to let your body breathe at
night when you can this reduces sweat
and odor so that bacteria can't really
grow down there which is obviously
really really good so that doesn't lead
to infection also if you can try to wear
cotton underwear instead of like silk
because you obviously want to allow that
area to breathe whereas silky can
sometimes trap the kind of moisture and
you know the sweat and all that kind of
stuff which you definitely don't wanna
try and purchase cotton underwear as
it's a lot better for you so my low
point is to wear a little less tight
fitted clothing now I know I am
literally
crying about this point because I love
tight-fitting clothing you guys know
they're so sometimes it's just really
good to just pop on a loose pair of
joggers or just some trousers in general
so I think that wearing loose fitted
clothing a few times a week is
definitely really beneficial my next
point it's kind of self-explanatory and
I feel like it's just you know a given
but that is to stay hydrated it is so
important to drink at least 2 liters a
day of water although our vaginas do
have their own a cleaning system is
still really important to stay hydrated
so that the water can flush out any
toxins from your body not only will it
help of your downstairs area but it will
also help with your skin I feel like
drinking water makes my skin so much
clearer especially because I used to
have quite a lot of spots all the time
but ever since I started religiously
drinking water my spots have definitely
really eased off so I would recommend
for you guys to drink as much water as
you can the next topic is periods I feel
like you know periods are just one of
those things that we all struggle with
is just the burden of being a woman
there to tackle periods we have three
means of doing it we have tampons pads
and also at the menstrual cup neither of
those ways is wrong but obviously if you
guys haven't tried all three of the
options you definitely should just to
see which one is the best for you are of
course the pros and cons to each of the
ways of protecting yourself for example
tampons give you the daily comfort of
being able to move around and also go
swimming however they are a lot less
absorbent especially if you have a quite
a heavy period so that's something to
bear in mind now sanitary pads are a
little bit more comforting to those of
you girls who have a slightly heavier
period because obviously there's a lot
more security and protection however if
they're particularly bulky you got to
make sure that you use the right one for
you and for your flowers I do make sure
you choose carefully which one it is
that's right for you and make sure you
change it regularly allowing it we have
the menstrual cup menstrual cups or
something I didn't really know about
until like last year if you guys don't
know what a menstrual cup here this is
what they look like it's basically like
a bell shaped cup that you can insert up
there and you can actually use this time
and time again after a thorough
cleansing the difference with the
menstrual cup is that it doesn't
actually absorb but rather it collects
your menstrual fluid so the main pro of
a menstrual cup
it's a lot more environmentally friendly
because obviously you're not throwing
out tampons and pads all the time every
time you have your period and you're
just reusing the menstrual cup over and
over again after cleaning it the con is
that it's a little bit more difficult to
insert as it is kind of a fiddly shape
so you have to really practice that one
so like I said it's definitely really
worth it trying out all of these options
for you guys so that you can choose at
which one is most comfortable and most
correct for yourself now tip number
eight is for ingrown hairs
they are so bloomin annoying so many
women out there struggle with ingrown
hairs all the time and it's so annoying
especially when you've just shaved
you're ready to pop on your new bikini
and go on holiday and there they are the
ingrown hairs and the razor bump
I find myself that after I shave if I
wear like tight-fitting clothing kind of
like jeans or skinny jeans
I guess so many more ingrown hairs this
definitely goes back to the skinny jeans
point that I made earlier basically I
think it's really beneficial to try and
wear less tight fitted clothing
especially a few days after you have
shaved because basically what happens is
your hair is trying to pretty much grow
out but there's no room for it to do
that so what it does it basically just
curls back around and grow straight into
your skin I know so Pleasant and the
yeah my tip for ingrown hairs is just to
wear less tight fitted clothing a few
days after you have shaved and also just
in general keep the area really nice and
moisturized now for tip number nine is
try not to do shy spraying water up
there you might be thinking that you're
staying more hygienic that you know
you're getting rid of all the foul smell
but in actual fact what you're doing is
you're actually affecting the pH balance
of your vagina which is obviously like I
said not the best thing you should do if
you haven't been doing personally you
may not even notice a difference to be
honest but what you can actually do is
cause a yeast infection and bacterial
vaginosis how you ask well basically
when your douching you pretty much flush
out all of the good bacteria from your
intimate area and whilst you're doing
that it's also allowing more room for
the bad bacteria to grow in now if you
decide to do SH and you already have a
bacterial infection that is honestly not
something you want to do you can
actually cause the infection to grow
into your reproductive organs up there
which is definitely something you don't
want to do so your my tip is to stop
douching and in
then you can actually reach for some
intimate wipes they are designed for
down there so you should be able to stay
clean on the go now to shave or not to
shave that is the question if you want
to shave that is totally up to you don't
let society control what you should and
shouldn't do there's honestly no right
or wrong for this one since shaving is
one of the most popular processes of
hair removal I think it is worth talking
about one miss that should definitely be
cleared up is the fact that hair does
not grow back thicker if you have shaved
and your hair does appear thicker to you
I think it's just the way you have
actually shaved and the way in the angle
that the hair has been cut out when hair
is shaved and it's blunt it definitely
can appear a lot more thicker as opposed
to when it's natural and not car and
it's just kind of like feathered out on
the end also while so on the topic of
shaving and make sure you shave in the
direction of the hair rather than under
the grain I have honestly loved my
lesson I used to shave against the grain
and let me tell you there was a lot of
razor bumps also after you've shaved I
think it's really important to close the
pores that you don't get razor bumps and
ingrown hairs and all that kind of stuff
and you can actually do this by just
placing a cold compress on top of the
area and this will just kind of close up
the pores make the swelling go down as
well this will definitely soothe the
area and reduce the razor bumps and the
ingrown hairs and if you decide not to
shave I think it's really beneficial to
just use some trimmers and trim the area
obviously you don't want it to outgrow
and just be really really messy down
there
you definitely want to keep it really
neat for the sake of your hygiene as
when your hair is a lot longer down
there it can kind of absorb and collect
sweat which is definitely something you
don't want cuz you want the area to stay
nice and fresh so those were my ten tips
on how to maintain feminine hygiene this
is one of those videos that I honestly
never thought I would film on my channel
but I think it's actually really
important that I start doing these you
guys know we always have so much fun on
this channel but I think it's really
important to just sit down have a
one-to-one chat about some important
things and I hope that today I could
have been that older sisters and some of
you guys that I never had that I wish
told me these things I think this is a
topic that definitely needs to be talked
about a lot more so I really hope you
