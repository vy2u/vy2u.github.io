channel I hope you guys oh wow so today
I have another tricky face makeup I know
you guys love my previous one and it was
so much fun to film so I thought I would
do another one of these and this is the
look that I'm creating for you guys
today if you haven't seen my previous
trippy face makeup I will leave it in
the eye right now so you guys can check
it out and if you want to see any of my
previous Halloween tutorials I'll have a
whole playlist just down below so you

to this channel for more videos like
this also you may have noticed this
little kind of creepy pumpkin just
behind me me and my boyfriend have
actually filmed a pumpkin carving
challenge so that's over on his channel
I'll have that in the eye so you guys
can check it out I think I want but I
want you guys to let me know so make
sure you head over to that video and
leave a comment down below and let me
know what you think but if you guys want
to see how to recreate this look then
just keep on watching so to start off
the makeup I'm going to be reaching for
a brown eyebrow pencil and this one is
from Maybelline and with this I'm just
gonna map out where my features are
going to be I'm kind of doing it in like
a slanted diagonal shape rather than
directly underneath like I did with my
previous one this one is kind of a
little bit more tricky to map out so I
am using two different mirrors to kind
of see how my features look from two
different perspectives which is why I'm
looking over to one side constantly I
think having two different perspectives
makes it much easier to recreate this
look I'm then going in with a white face
paint from snazaroo and I'm filling in
the inner parts of my eyes with this
next I'm taking the Urban Decay ultimate
basics palette and I'm taking a brown
matte shadow from this palette I'm going
to be recreating the depths of the eye
as I'm seeing it in real life and I'm
also recreating the eye makeup that I am
currently wearing with the same shallow
I'm then taking a darker shadow and I'm
working into the lash line of my two
fake eyes I'm also darkening that with a
black kohl pencil just to recreate my
eyeliner and then also going into the
eyebrow and defining that as well to
make it look more three-dimensional and
realistic I'm now just contouring my
nose and the shadows of it
I see it in real life the key of this
look is to keep referring back to your
real features and that's definitely
what's going to help make it look much
more realistic I'm now just going into
the eye and I'm deepening up the crease
as well as adding some eyeliner and as
you can see here I'm also just
replicating the shadow that my brow bone
creates I'm defining that on my real
brow bone as well is to have the three
brow bones look really similar and as
close to each other as possible I'm now
going to add an extra third lip because
I forgot to do this when I was mapping
out my lips but this definitely
completes the look and I'm just filling
in the lip with Dolce K by Kylie
cosmetics which is the same lipstick
that I'm wearing on my real lips I'm
then contouring my fake lips with some
black eyeshadow and I'm also creating
the little lines and grooves that you
can see in my real lips I'm then going
in and just defining my nostrils making
them darker and after that I'm gonna go
in with some highlights so I'm returning
back to my white face paint and I'm just
creating the highlights on the bridge of
my nose the top of my Cupid's the inner
corners of my eyes and my brow bones
just like the general places where you
would normally highlight anyways I'm now
taking a bright blue eyeliner this one
is from Avon and I'm just basically
drawing out where the iris of my eye is
going to be I'm then going over this
with an eye shadow to match my eye color
a little bit better as the eyeliner was
quite bright and then taking a black
eyeliner from Kiko and I'm creating the
pupil of my eye as well as going around
the circumference of it to make the eye
ball stand out a little bit more I'm
then taking a white liner from NYX and
I'm creating the little glare in my eye
just as I can see it in my real eyes and
this is definitely gonna bring my drawn
on eyes to life and then returning back
to a black liner and I'm just creating
the little lashes and to finish off the
look I'm just returning back to that NYX
white liner and I'm just creating some
extra highlights with this where I feel
like it's appropriate and this is the
finished look I think it's so so creepy
and it's definitely a little bit more on
the time-consuming side but if you take
your time and have patience you'll
definitely be able to recreate this and
freak out some of your friends and that
is all for my trippy face makeup I
really hope you
enjoyed it and found it helpful and if
