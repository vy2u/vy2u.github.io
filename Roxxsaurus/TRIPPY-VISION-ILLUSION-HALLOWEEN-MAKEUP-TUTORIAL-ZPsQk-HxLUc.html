today I'm gonna be creating it yet
another Halloween makeup luck so in
today's video I'm creating this really
creepy trippy makeup illusion kind of
thing I created a few of these at last
you guys really enjoyed them so I
thought I would come back at you guys
with another one this year I went for a
slightly different approach so I went
for like a vertical but diagonal
approach so all of the eyes are kind of
meeting inwards which somehow it kind of
makes it even creepier also I found at a
party trick that you can do if you do
this makeup look watch it looks like my
eyes my lips are moving don't ask if you
guys enjoyed this look make sure you
smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and also subscribe my campus
already because I would love to have you
here come and join the dinosaur family
but that is enough rambling without
further ado let's get on into the
tutorial okay so to start off this
makeup I'm taking a brown eyeliner and
I'm starting to outline the shape of my
eyes so I'm just looking down into a
mirror and I'm trying to trace the same
kind of shape that my eyes have I really
take your time with this and really work
on the shape of your own eye obviously
everyone's eye shape is gonna be
different so really just try and copy
your own then also drawing on the upper
lid and the brow to really copy that
same area of my eye once you have the
initial set of eyes done it's gonna get
so much easier from here because what
you have to do now is just copy that
exact same shape underneath but smaller
you're also gonna have to take that eye
a little bit onto your nostrils
depending on your face shape but that's
what I had to do and it works fine for
me
lastly I'm gonna draw on the eyes a
little bit larger than my natural eyes
on my forehead and I'm gonna create
these slightly wider as well I'm then
moving on to drawing the browser for
this you just want to copy the shape of
your brow and basically fill it in very
lightly
the next step is a bit of shading so
we're going to introduce some depth into
these eyes by just applying some brown
eyeshadow onto the top and bottom of the
lid this is going to give the eyes that
more three-dimensional look and is also
going to replicate the same eye makeup
that I have on on my real eyes
once you have finished going around the
eyes you also want to create this curved
kind of brow it's gonna create a fake
eyebrow a fact is if you look at my real
brothers that curved sense of shadow
where you can see that my kind of
eyebrow is protruding from the rest of
my face so we just want to create that
with a bit of brown eyeshadow here and
then going into the set of eyes on my
forehead and I'm just creating that nose
bridge effect with it that same shadow
once you're finished with the shadows
I'm gonna go back in with the brown
eyeliner and I'm just going to create a
few lines underneath the eye to create
that sense of fold we all have that
slight little crease and line underneath
our eyes so you just want to replicate
that as well
the next step is to fill the eyes with
some white so I'm just taking the NYX
jumbo pencil I'm just filling it in very
lightly on each of the eyes and then
using a angled detailer brush I'm just
going to blend this all into the eye to
make sure that it's all one even color
now moving back to the brows I'm taking
a black eyeliner and I'm just creating
little strokes to imitate the notion of
my real hair so for this I'm just
creating upward strokes and as I get to
the arch it's gonna start basically
angling them outwards as the natural
hairs of my brows do because the black
is a little bit harsh and it doesn't
really look like my real eyebrows I'm
gonna go in with another brow product
over the top to kind of diffuse that
black and really blend it all together
so now we're going to actually focus on
the outline of the eyes and for this you
just want to take a felt tip line
there's something very thin and easy to
control I've got a bit of eyeliner on my
real eyes going on all around so I'm
just going to recreate that on my fake
eyes
once you're finished you can also go
into the actual lids and make the crease
even more prominent by adding some black
I'm then returning back to that brow
powder that we used on our fake brows
and I'm just going to outline every
single one of the eyes further to create
even more depth around the fake eyes
I'm then going in with a big blending
brush and some brown matte shadow and
I'm just going over all of the eyes
really creating that brow shape that you
can see on my actual real eyes the next
thing to do is take a gray eyeshadow on
a very small detailer brush and just pop
in some shading onto the eyes obviously
human eyes are not pure white because we
have our lashes and our eyebrows kind of
shading the eye so you want to recreate
that shadow just below the lash line and
then going in with a blue eyeliner
pencil and I'm just creating the iris of
the eye so I'm just creating a big round
circle trying to imitate the size of my
own irises once you have done that you
then want to go in with a slightly
darker color of your eye obviously my
eyes are blue so I'm just going in with
the darker blue and just shade in the
very top of the eyeball just as I did
for the actual whites of the eye as well
once you've done that you want to take
your black eyeliner and just go around
the iris to really give it that
definitions as you can see my real eyes
also have that darkness around the edges
of the iris
the next thing I'm doing is I'm taking a
concealer a little bit lighter than my
actual skin tone and I'm just using that
as a slight bit of highlight into the
inner corners of my eyes and also the
brow bones this is really going to bring
those places forward and make them look
even more 3-dimensional once you've done
that you will never turn back to the
black eyeliner and create the lashes on
your eyes so you want to make them quest
braddock and not too perfect because
obviously your real lashes don't have
the exact same distance between each
other so you just want to make them
quite random
once you've done that you want to take
the eyeliner and create the actual pupil
inside your eye you want to try and make
them the same size as your real ones I'm
then taking a white eyeliner and I'm
just creating the highlight of my eyes
so again I'm just using a mirror to see
where the highlight is hitting my
natural eyes and I'm recreating that
same thing I'm also patting some of the
liner in to make it a little bit more
blended and not so harsh
the last thing to do for the eyes is add
the actual inner corner which is like
this light pinky kind of color so I'm
just doing that to every single eye now
the next thing you want to do is draw
your fake nose on the bridge of your
nose just between your two eyes this is
going to make it look as if the two
pairs of eyes on your forehead actually
have a nose as well so what I'm doing is
I'm just observing my real nose and I'm
just trying to create that same shape
but between my eyes I'm not gonna lie
this part is quite difficult because
it's such an awkward place to be drawing
on a nose but what you have to do is
just take your time and be patient and
you'll get to make the nose look more
defined and realistic I'm taking some
black eyeliner and I'm just going in and
around the nostrils to really give it
more shape and then I'm also taking that
light-colored concealer and I'm just
putting that on the tip of my fake nose
to make it look like that part is a lot
more forward than the rest next thing
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a regular
bronzer and I'm just contouring on my
cheeks quite heavily to really add and
accentuate that diagonal shape that
we've created with the eyes and the last
step to do is draw the lip on your chin
this step really makes this whole look
even more confusing so what I'm doing is
I'm just taking a lip liner and I'm
outlining the very shape of my lips and
filling that in as well and then taking
a lip product that is the color of my
lip and I'm just going over all of that
and just really shading that in with a
darker pencil next i'm taking the brown
brow pencil and i'm just going in at the
very center of my lip and also the upper
lip to really shake that is as you can
see my upper lip has that natural shade
to it and then setting all of that in
place with some a translucent powder and
to finish it off and then adding some
highlight with a white eyeliner and i'm
just creating that on the top lip as
well just so that they both look the
same and lastly to finish off the lip
i'm just creating some fake corners of
the lips with some brown eyeshadow so
this is the finished look i think it
looks so creepy especially these little
eyes here that kind of makes me think of
spider eyes let me know down below where
