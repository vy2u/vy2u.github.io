channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far so in today's video
I'm really excited because I'm going to
be trying on bikinis from eBay I have
already done a trying on eBay prom
dresses which and did not go down so
well
so I don't know what's going to happen
in this video but hopefully there will
be at least one that I really like I
have purchased five different bikini
from eBay and we will see together if
any of these are any good
you guys are brand new to my channel and
make sure you guys subscribe come and
join the dinosaur family I would love to
have you here also don't forget to it's
much like Hugh sums up to down below if
you guys enjoy this kind of video and
also don't forget to click that little
bell bus in it so you guys can get
notified every time I post a new video
okay but without cover rumbling let's do
this to the video so the first bikini
that I have purchased is this one here
it's a really nice kind of like a light
blue color it has like a really cool
floral pattern on it and these are the
bottoms just very regular bottoms they
have like this nice little lacy trimming
on the edges is nothing like I remember
in the actual photo on eBay so I'll show
you guys the actual original photo like
the expectation of this bikini kit is
far from the reality so this is what a
bikini looks like on the fit is actually
pretty nice I haven't got anything bad
to say about that I feel the material
like I can see that it's quite cheap see
may like the fabric is thick enough so
that you don't really see any parts of
your skin like as it gets wet so I
already haven't got anything bad to say
about that but the quality does seem
like you know it's not the best kind of
material which I guess you could expect
with a bikini from ebay for as much as I
paid for it anyway so is the first
bikini I really like if I'm very
disappointed with the fact that it's not
like the picture at all the next bikini
is actually one of my favorites I have
purchased out of all of these and this
is the top it's got like a stripy white
and pink design on it which is very like
Victoria Secret that's why I purchased
it yeah on the website and the breeding
ID the picture was ivory super fitted
and everything but when I tried this on
it just would not like flattering on my
top half anyways like this
top bit it's just so Mike loose and
baggy I don't know if you guys can see
that but I just I don't know I just
don't think that this top part fit very
well but the bottom however dish fit
really nicely they're super fitted so I
can always use the bottom with another
like top half because I do really love
the pattern on them that are so huge so
and the weird part about this bikini is
the fact that these things that come
with it so this is like a little choker
part that's meant to sit around your
neck like this and I give that this has
to like obviously be able to sit for
your head so has to be quite stretchy
and it doesn't go over my head but it's
just like when it around my neck it just
sits super loose which is not flattering
and like a choker and then these two
parts are little like sleeves or most
them and to go around your arms to kind
of give off the effect that your bikini
is attached to your sleeve like the
bikini top of giving it like kind of
like a Bardot effect and I don't really
know how I feel about these I feel like
they look really cute but I don't know I
feel like you'd get really weird tan
lines if you actually were to wear these
at a swimming pool I feel like these
little parts here make it really cute
for photos but in actual practical
everyday life I just feel like these are
completely useless because of the fact
that you just get like a really weird
tan line and this part here is not even
like fluttering around your neck
assholes but overall I really like the
bottom so I guess that I can always
reuse these ones with another top
because this top is just way too baggy
on me now the next bikini that I
purchased is this white one here so the
top half is like a strapless and bando
kind of thing that goes over your chest
and this is so tight you guys I don't
know if this is like my chest but I got
this in a size s and I thought that it
would fit me because most but he needs
our size F usually fit me on like all
over top and bottom but this was just so
tiny but the bottom part again was
actually quite nicely fitted the bottom
part is like very out-there it's not
something I would personally wear to go
swimming or sunbathing because the cut
is super like high so you really see
your sides like the side
of like your bikini line a lot and
personally that's not really my thing
but knowing this is quite flattering to
get that kind of like an hourglass shape
because it's super cinched in at the
waist and I feel like the bottoms are
just very nicely fitted so again if you
dispatches this bikini
you could always rock the bottom not
necessarily at the top now the next
bikini is this one here so it's quite
hard to show on camera the bottom part
is basically like a high waist and
bottom with this cross see kind of like
lace-up effect on the side so when I saw
it on the photos I thought this would
look really cute like quite edgy and
when I tried it on I was like I kind of
look like a sausage that's been wrapped
around in string do you guys know what
I'm talking about because that is
basically what I looked like I don't
know I still really like the bottoms but
I don't know how flattering they are on
me personally and also if I was to wear
this at a natural swimming pool or like
sunbathing the tan lines guys that's how
long they would be sewn bad but although
the bottle hostelry super nice at the
top part I guess it was okay but it just
didn't fit perfectly especially these
pots on the side like this is like the
cup and then these parts on the side
that sit here they just kind of work a
bit loose and I don't know if that's
just the design of it but it just didn't
look as flattering as I would have liked
it to and alas the bikini is actually
not making it to swimsuit so this is
what it looks like it's kind of like a
fluorescent pink flamingo bikini because
strapped up like this really cute for
really kind of effect when I saw this on
the website I thought you can't go wrong
this is just like the simplest bikini
flash swim to that you could buy and I
thought this would be really nicely
fitted but I was very wrong so so
basically the fit of it in general is
actually okay but the only thing that I
do not understand at all is the back so
then be quite hard to show on camera but
you guys will be able to see this in the
Tryon part so basically one is the
straps around my waist
perfectly however the other one is why
really loose and I really don't know
what I'm meant to be doing with it I
feel like it's meant to just sit around
my back like the top one does but yeah
the bottom is very like stretchy it's
just kind of like hanging loose and I
don't know what's going on with it
I feel like it's just the company's
fault who made it or produce the
swimsuits that just made it a little bit
faulty with the strap being really loose
and hanging apart from a strap that
swimsuit would have been perfect it's so
cute I love the back and the photos in
that swimsuit would be amazing that that
one strap just let it down remember all
of my bikinis afro eBay I feel like my
favorite one of the lot that like fit
the best words this one here which is
the blue one although it's nothing like
the photo I feel like it just fit me the
best out of all of them and then my
second favorite is probably this one
here because it looks like Victoria's
Secret and I love Victoria Secret I mean
I don't know which of these swimsuits
was your favorite and what video that
you would like me to film next on this
channel I'm actually thinking of doing
an eBay shoes at trial Hall so I'm
buying pairs of shoes under like ten
dollars and making one of these videos
