I'm going to be trying on some eBay
addresses for other ten pounds of slash
dollars and I'm really excited for this
because I usually bought so many of
these dresses look at that look at that
I absolutely love filming these kinds of
eBay triangle and sort of video so if
you guys haven't seen my other ones that
I've done in the past
you're totally shared by clicking any of
the links in the description I've left
free vibe because I love love those
videos if you guys know Prime you and
you haven't seen my face before you
totally should that subscribe a come and
join and the dinosaur family and also
don't forget to click the little Bell
notification button just down below to
again notified every time I post a new
video also comment down below and let me
know which one of these dresses with
your favorite yes I also have a daily
vlogging channel called Rock
therobsblogs if you guys haven't checked
that out yet you totally should but
without some review and mess kit on into
the video okay so these are all of the
dresses that I actually purchase I think
there's like about seven in there and
tell them I'm pretty sure I play suits
but they're pretty much the same thing
so all of these dresses I actually
purchased for under 10 pounds or 10
pounds and basically in this video we're
going to see if they're anything like
the pictures on eBay if they're worth
money it's the quality of life or it's
just a complete waste of your money so
first up I'm going to try and open this
one here because it's super sparkly and
I'm really intrigued so this is what the
picture on eBay looks like ad which is
gonna see if it is anything like the
picture okay I'm actually kind of
nervous to let you know it's better so
much mostly on religiously okay
so now I see that this is one of the
places I actually bought and as soon as
I open the packaging all of the glitter
went on my knees like let me just
quickly show you do you guys see that
like my leggings are literally covered
in the flitter and it's all over the
floor as well so if you're planning on
buying this five things first is that
the glitter is going to be overwhelming
okay but the actual playsuit looks kind
of nice I'm not gonna lie so this is
what it looks like it actually keeps
shedding glitter I don't know what
about it surely if you put this through
the wash all the glitter will just come
off so weird
anyway this is the place to so it's kind
of like quite short
it's got like a whatsit messy kind of
material and then like a filter material
underneath and it has like this glittery
pattern made up of like gold glitter and
white glitter and it's the white glitter
that keeps falling off everywhere
but it looks kind of nice I'm pretty
sure that this kind of wraps around the
neck like that and then these little
sleeves just kind of fall on here like
that I'm not very good at describing
this so let's go ahead and try it on and
see what we think
okay so this is the first place ooh and
what it looks like on I actually kind of
like yeah I think the sleeves make it
look a little bit weird though I don't
know that with me the only thing I would
say about this is that it shows really
like a lot like it really does shed a
lot or the glitter is fully lost
everywhere and the attribute is fabric
like this first kind of layer on top is
really like hard and sick and it's just
not very comfortable to wear apart from
that like this back is sitting really
loose and it's just kind of like falling
down and it's not really like fluttering
in my opinion I don't know I guess it's
okay and let's kind of like a bougie eat
and I think I would like it a lot better
on without the sleeves I felt like it
kind of sitting a bit weird around like
my chest area too like these pots here
should be a little bit further away I'd
say not so close together I would say
this is okay for 10 pounds but I
probably would've worked out just
because it sheds blue to everywhere and
it gets stuck together like the stomach
is actually stuck together can you guys
see that I have to like unstick it
although I really like the concept in
the color and the glitter amid place ooh
I think I'm going to have to say thumbs
down for this one
okay the next dress I'm going to try on
is this one here and I'm
what insight okay let's have a look okay
so it's like an white dress I've
actually forgotten all the dresses that
I purchased not good I but I do remember
buying this one actually and so
basically this is like a long what it's
not that long it's kind of like over the
me white dress but the reason why I
bought it is because I really loved this
by detailing like kind of like a criss
cross grid kind of detailing at the top
and it has a like a choker kind of
effect too so it's kind of on like on
style at the moment my first initial
reaction of this is that it feels really
cheap like the material actually quite
cheap and it has a stain on it what the
heck why is there a stain on it like
this is brand new that's kind of broke
okay I hope this hasn't been worn but
anyway yeah it feels quite cheap because
this my grid grid light fabric here
hasn't got a trimming to kind of like
stop the edges from fraying at all like
I don't know if you guys can see that
like the fabric is literally just there
like that and it could easily fray oh my
god there's another stain at the back
you serious do you guys see this do you
guys see that that's like an actual
state oh my god there's like more than
one it's as if someone actually wore
this that's really gross I don't get why
this kind of thing happens with eBay
dresses because like I'm buying it as
new on eBay but then it comes and it's
like ripped or as if someone warned
already it's so strange but anyway but
let's try this on and let's hope that no
one else has tried this on before
because that's kind of weird
oh my god guys so I'm just getting
changed into this white one here and I
literally noticed that on the neckline
there's like foundation marks this is
before I even put on what the hell why
has this been worn I really don't want
to try this on now because it's like a
literal foundation marks on it do you
see that you I really don't touch the
foundation okay so this is the dress on
um I'm not gonna lie it looks really
cheap in my opinion I don't know tell me
what you guys think I just really don't
like
yeah like I love the concept of it and
it looks really nice on the actual
picture but now that I'm wearing it I'm
really not feeling it it gives me
literally like no shape it doesn't cinch
into the waist like it should be like
this not like baggy I wanna touch as me
but I'm also really disgusted about the
fact that there's like foundation around
my neck like I'm sorry but why did they
send me a used dress that like I just
just don't understand why I put it on
anyways I've got to do it for the tube
oh so nasty I don't know guys this is
midnight or does it look really cute a
kind of canto I feel like if it looks
cheap I don't know okay the next dress
I'm gonna try on is and this one here so
let's open this bad boy up okay so this
is like a flowery summary kind of dress
I kind of like pattern already okay
let's open it oh my god this is so
pretty okay I can't wait to try this on
so loose with me the dress is like
really really long very long fabric it's
got like a slit in the fabric as well it
has a underlining thing which is quite
good quality quite stick material as
well and then it has like this ruched
kind of material here with these little
Bardot sleeves on the side I think this
is going to be actually the best one so
far
guys I am Loki loving this one and I
knew our word I mean the only thing that
would set up quite weird about it is the
fact that the split is like literally
directly in the center and then when I'm
walking like you'll be able to see in
some please we'd like undergarment
laughing I wish this little kind of
off-center a little bit more then if
this dress would be literally perfect
I wish I had this dreadful when I went
to Portugal because it just like a
frickin a really loving this dress and
like the color and pattern and
everything about it but the only
downfall is the slit the next dress is
this one here and this is it seems like
very small most amount of material so
I'm kind of
rude okay so it's basically like a short
miniskirt dress rather it's black and
it's got like the floral kind of
newsprint on it and it's very short
though like literally that's it that's
all there is to the fabric so I'm kind
of worried that this is going to be way
too short for me and then it was a head
like this wrap thing on the back which I
don't know if I'll be able to do myself
because they'll be quite difficult but
I'll give it my best
doesn't seem like you'll be see-through
so that's always a plus and if you like
the design like the pattern so let's try
it on I have to say this dress is
actually quite nice I really love the
shape like it may be quicker with a
little bit more cinching in like this
and maybe if it was a little bit more
body corner then it would be better like
as you can see I'm just inching it in at
the back room so much difference so
there really is a little bit loose
around like the hips and the wasting is
really nice for like a night out or just
like a party I have to say one thing
though it is really short and this is
what the back looks like it just got
like a little snit at the back and then
compile it into a bow which I didn't do
a very good job off but I'm sure you
guys can do it way better overall with
some heels I feel like this drug could
be quite nice so I definitely write this
one next one actually can't remember
what this is it's just black I would
carry I remember this one and so it's
basically like a long t-shirt dress I
felt like you could really go wrong with
it because it's essentially just a plain
and black t-shirt dress it has got a
v-neck and this little choker thing here
and I thought this would be cute with
some like knee-high shoes or boots or
whatever at it I think this one's going
to be quite good and I got this it aside
and if you want to rate this one it is
cute it's totally cute I really really
like it I mean I said I don't think you
can go wrong with a simple plain like
t-shirt dryer type of dress is really
like on trend at the moment and you
could definitely dress it up with some
jewelry or some high heels I really
really love this dress I just
do that you homer and go wrong with a
plain t-shirt dress so that's why I
picked it up and it was less than 10
pounds so you can't go wrong you could
probably pick something like this up on
top shop or like misguided or something
and it would probably cost you like
twice the price okay so this next one is
actually really nice-looking it's like a
baby pink kind of like a powdery pig
play suit it has this really cute like
trimming all around the top so this is
like the sleeve and it's kind of like
cold-shoulder slash off the shoulder
it's very like girly and flowing which I
really love and the actual like
underlining material of the short seems
thick and not see-through so it's
looking good and really hoping that this
is going to fit so let's go try it on so
this is the next place and I love the
color the only thing I have to say is
that these sleeves are really
uncomfortable the quite tight around the
arm and like I can't lift my thumbs up
because the whole thing does Rises also
these shrubs are a little bit low for my
life and I feel like they should be a
tiny bit higher but until I can just
pile it and place the back I would say
again it's hanging a bit low and that's
just me but I feel like it should be a
little bit higher okay I take that back
you can adjust the strap so it should be
a little bit higher like this now apart
from this please I can't really see
anything wrong with that I really love
the color it's comfortable it's not
see-through and I really like it okay so
the last dress I'm going to show you I'm
very excited about because this one
iswhat on the website I would like at
this dress is on point like I absolutely
love it so let's see if if this is going
to be anything like of a picture I mean
this is what it looks like it seems
quite good quality it's kind of like a
black plain dress it's kind of like a
body con shape so it's interview another
waist and then it has like this lacy
kind of detailing that goes over across
the shoulder like this okarin traffic's
like this or like this but I'm pretty
sure it's off the shoulder and then on
the bottom it's got the same kind of
black lace trimming which is really
really cute so let's go try it out okay
and this
the last Drive um I love how like
tight-fitting it is it really gives me
like a nice figure but these straps here
I like really really loose like they'll
let you fall I think actually in the
picture this is how she wore it but
because the straps are so low the actual
like cups of the dress new cuts here
actually fall down with it and you could
totally have like a boob slip event so I
think I would actually wear this dress
with the straps all the way up like this
part from the strap situation I drill it
again still maintenance required to 3pi
fitting unlike the other dresses that I
tried today and really gutted that the
dress can't comfortably sit in this kind
of position because this is how the
model wore on the website and I really
love this kind of shape that it creates
but I feel like I can still make it work
if I put the straps all the way up like
this okay so those were all of it be a
dresses that I got from ebay for under
10 pounds slash dollars I am literally
blown away by some of these like some of
these will literally fit really well I
think my least favorite one is this one
here because it has like stains and it
is not the best fabric at all like some
of the other ones are actually amazing a
fabric quality but this you can just
tell that it's really really cheaply
made but some of the other dresses
actually look really nice and you would
never be able to tell that you got them
from eBay for like under 10 pounds it
just goes to show how many cool things
you can actually buy from really cheap
from eBay and it's pretty much the same
quality as like high street clothes then
we know down below which one of these
dresses Atwoods your favorite in your
opinion I really like this one here just
to get you listed can't go wrong with it
and also the black t-shirt dress was
like the troca neck if you guys enjoyed
