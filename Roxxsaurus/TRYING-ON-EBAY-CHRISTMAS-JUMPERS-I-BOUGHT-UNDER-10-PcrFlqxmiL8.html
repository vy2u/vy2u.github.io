today as you can tell by our background
and also my jumper I'm feeling a very
festive and I know I'm a little bit
early so please excuse that but I'm just
so excited for December that's coming up
and all the holiday videos and I just I
just couldn't wait so today I'm going to
be starting with the first ever video
from my Christmas series of this year
and I'm gonna kickstart it with an eBay
video because I haven't done one in a
long time so today I'm gonna be testing
out some Christmas jumpers from ebay for
under 10 pounds I picked up five
different jumpers and I'm so excited to
try them on for you guys if you guys are
brand new here make sure you guys
subscribe and also click that
notification bow button down below to
get notified of every time I post a new
video but that is enough rambling
without further ado let's get on into
the video okay so the first Christmas
jumper I've got right here and I'm so
excited to open it okay so this first
one it looks very promising this is what
it looks like inside it's just like your
typical Santa like miss Claus or mr.
Claus kind of outfit I like the jumper
but it feels very cheaply made like I'm
not gonna live let's check how much I
actually paid for this so I have
actually paid $4.99 for this jumper
which is an absolute bargain and I mean
if you're only gonna wear this jumper
for like one day like for Christmas and
I feel like why spend so much money the
only thing I would say is that it's just
very like cheap quality like the fabric
isn't that nice to the touch so I don't
know how pleasant this is gonna be to
wear but we'll see in the Tryon part
it's quite oversized too which is really
nice this is what it looks like it's
very light simple it's just like I said
the kind of like miss Claus mr. Claus
kind of Santa outfit I really liked this
when I saw it on the website though so I
just had to get it and I think it's very
cute it's also got a little tag as well
that says like Merry Christmas to and
from so you could totally give this to
someone as a gift so yeah this is the
jumper I mean apart from the quality I
haven't really got anything bad to say
about it so let's go try it on okay guys
this is the first jumper and I actually
really like how I'm saying that was
quite bad quality and to be fair is but
it doesn't really interfere with like
the actual wear of it I think it's
really nice and like oversized it kind
of like covers my bottom which is really
good and the sleeves are like very cozy
and long so you can kind of like do this
and it's just really really cute and
cozy so I really liked it and it was so
affordable as well so I mean I have
already got that much bad to say about
it apart from the quality which I mean
you kind of get we paid for so it's not
too bad okay so I have another Christmas
jumper right here so let's open this bad
boy up
ooh this one's a green one I actually
have never owned a green Christmas
jumper believe it now oh this is so cute
this is like the elf kind of costume and
this is a really nice quality like it's
really soft I didn't expect it to be
this soft that's actually adorable and
got a candy cane on the side - this is
very oversized and cozy and I feel like
it's just gonna be perfect - like when
Christmas Day or just leading up to
Christmas - and be this jumper cost me
like 11 pounds so that's like one pound
over the budget but I mean it's only a
pound but I just couldn't resist getting
this cuz I just really wanted to be an
elf let's be honest okay guys so this is
the next jumper and oh my god I love it
so much I love the fact how oversized it
is like this is the size small but it's
so oversized it's really like cozy
I love the designer backing it's so cute
and I love the sleeves - they're kind of
like really long and oversized actually
give this jump out of big thumbs up I
think it's really cute
okay so I have at this next jumper right
here oh my god
oh my god yes
this jumper was like amazing when I saw
this online I was like aha I need this I
just need this hand we just it's
basically a reindeer this is so cute and
it's so cozy and fuzzy oh my god I love
it I just want to wear this forever it's
actually got like bells around the
neckline of the jumper which I mean
could potentially get a little bit
annoying I'm not gonna lie but it's the
festive season so let's go this is so
cute and look it's got even a little
like pom-pom for the Rudolph the
red-nosed reindeer this is so adorable
I'm totally gonna wear this for
Christmas like a hands down okay guys
this next jump that is literally the
cutest I mean look at it like that is
adorable I wish I was a tiny bit longer
so they would cover like my bottom but
it's okay it's not like the end of the
world I really just love the hood I
think it's so adorable this next jumper
again cost me $4.99 which is just insane
because you can't even get like
Christmas jumpers in like regular stores
for $4.99 they're usually really
expensive and okay so this quality of
this jumper seems kind of similar to the
first one that costs $4.99 so I guess
it's just like you get what you pay for
really I mean the quality isn't like the
worst you could totally live with it but
it's just not like amazing if that makes
sense but I do really like the design of
this jumper so it's got a little like
fawn on the front and it's half like
well it's mostly red but it's got like a
stripe of white where the snow is meant
to be and it's got like little
snowflakes all over it which is so
adorable it kind of reminds me of the
one I'm wearing at the moment but this
one's from Primark and it's got Mickey
Mouse on it anyways let's go try it on
and see how it actually feels on so this
is the next Christmas jumper I love the
design of this it really reminds me of
like Bambi this is the faun I just think
it's such like her old school kind of
Christmas jump I don't know it's kind of
like your ugly Christmas jumper but this
one
cute if that makes any sense it's like
that kind of like vintage Christmas
jumper style I guess I really like this
I think the design is really cute and it
feels really not that bad on my skin I
mean I thought it was going to be quite
like rough and maybe a bit itchy but
it's not at all so I definitely give
this one a thumbs up too okay so this
next jumper I can see right here is red
and white and this cost me how much were
you this cost me $7.99 which is actually
not bad as for the quality is kind of
similar to the one that costs $4.99 so
it's kind of like mmm but it's not too
bad but you're quite a nice design it's
very affordable and yeah it's kind of
like quite well made I would say like
the stitching isn't coming apart or
anything so that's all good yeah this is
just like your typical white and red
Christmas jumper with reindeer and
snowflakes what more could you want so
this is the next Christmas jumper I
really like this one it's really soft
and I love the colors it's so like I
don't know kinda reminds me of a candy
cane it's very like typical Christmas
colors like snow and like candy cane and
just Sun too kind of colors I love this
one so much I'm definitely gonna be
wearing this throughout December you
guys are totally gonna see this in a
video soon but yeah I really like this
one is again a little bit oversized
which is really nice it kind of covers
up my bum so you can obviously wear
leggings with this if you wanted to see
so quite long as well and this jump is
just so cozy and like walls so I
definitely really like this one too
so that was the Christmas jumpers from
eBay under 10 pounds I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video I'll have all
the links to the jumpers down below in
case you guys want to pick them up
yourself overall I think this video was
a success I mean there's nothing like
disastrous about the jumpers but I guess
I will give all of them a thumbs up they
were very affordable and the quality I
mean like I said there was some jumpers
that were a bit like
but I really like the designs on all of
them there's not really anything wrong
with them so I definitely rate them a
lot as I said this is my first like
Christmas or festive kind of video of
