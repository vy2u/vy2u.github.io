I'm gonna be trying on eBay costumes for
Halloween for under 10 pounds and I'm so
is super excited because I love
Halloween and it's so blooming soon I
just cannot wait now that Halloween is
so close I am so excited for my
Halloween series so you guys should
definitely check out my other videos
that I'm going to be posting around
Halloween time I know Halloween can be
kind of a struggle sometimes like trying
to find an affordable costume to wear
because it's like you don't want to
waste all that money to spend on a
costume for like one night but don't
worry guys I've got here so today I'm
going to be testing out these costumes
so you guys don't have to and I'm
basically gonna tell you if these are
worth the buy obviously and they're very
affordable so some of these could be an
absolute no no but some of these that
might be okay so we shall see if you
guys are braiding hair make sure you
subscribe come and join and the dinosaur
family I would love to have your hair by
the way today I am wearing a my merch if
you guys like it I'll pop the link down
below so you guys can check it out and
buy yourself a piece because if this
jumper is literally so like a full /
autumn appropriate it's so a bloomin
cozy and I am living in this jumper and
also I designed the logo myself so you
guys should definitely pick it up
because it's very sassy okay so I have
here a bunch of costumes that I am so
excited to open and you know just try on
and test out I will have all of the
links to these questions down below so
if you guys like any of these you can
pick them up yourself but let's jump
into the first cottage and the first
question that you see is and this one
here and this is actually a Mario
costume so there was actually a choice
of Mario or Luigi on the ebay website I
went for Mario because I love a good old
Mario so this is the picture of what it
looks like on the website okay so this
is it
the oh it's got a lot of pieces to it oh
okay what is this why did I get a thumb
I'm sorry but why does they come with a
thong it's a Mario costume uh well I am
definitely not gonna be wearing this but
it's bad if you want it it also comes
with a black mustache that you can
actually
I pop around your head and put on then
the next thing I see is a tiny little
tutu which I feel like this has meant to
me like the undergarment and it's
probably not gonna do a whole lot I'm
not gonna lie but it's bad this is what
the costume looks like it's just like
her little Mario dress I think this is
so cute like the quality isn't too bad
very thin but it's very like silky I
guess and then also with a costume it
comes of course as a Mario hat and I'm
so excited to put this on hang on oh
this is so cute it's actually does it
fit well that looks quite weird oh it's
a little bit washed but I'm sure we can
sort this out there we go and then also
we have some white gloves because you
cannot be Mario without the white gloves
okay so this is what the first costume
looks like actually it's pretty cute
like the quality is actually okay and
the fit is really nice like a shoe fits
me properly I kind of feel like I'm
Princess Peach trying to be Mario which
is kind of weird and this is the costume
close up I feel like it actually pretty
well made it doesn't feel too cheap so I
definitely give this a thumbs up so
moving on to the next costume I actually
wanted to pick up like a pumpkin kind of
costume for adults of course it's as you
quite hard to find it one like that for
adults but I've managed to find one so
this is it I haven't opened it yet and
I'm very excited to on the packaging it
says one size fits most what if I'm that
one percent of a hundred that doesn't
fit it can you imagine
okay so the costume is made out of like
very cheap material as this you may not
have felt like felt fabric you could
probably make this costume yourself it's
pretty cute though this is the little
hat that comes with it oh my goodness
this is so huge it's like a full-on
pumpkin oh my god this shoe is so cute I
knew I would love it like it's so big
you can wear whatever underneath it and
you're a pumpkin like can we just can we
just it feels really weird around the
arms like it's not
really comfortable like when you put
them down it was always like you have to
walk around like this the only fault
that I have with this costume is the
fact that this part of the leaf of the
pumpkin is actually like sewn together
and then if you guys can see that I
think it's really cute that has adorable
I am genuinely considering being a
pumpkin this year and move it on I have
a Mickey Mouse costume right here and
I'm so excited for this because I love
Mickey Mouse and I used to actually have
a Mickey Mouse costume when I was
younger I'll pop in a picture right here
so I definitely feel like this will be a
really cute costume at first we have of
course the Mickey Mouse ear door right
ahead and pop those on love it and
Mickey Mouse's yeah they're very like
floppy so then we have one no way
another thong I'm sorry but I don't like
wait is this the song I don't know what
this is meant to be yeah is a song it
was just a bit one key oh my goodness
why are they like including thumbs in a
Halloween costume and then we have and
the main part of the costume and this is
the dress and is actually so cute oh my
god I love this I feel like this will
actually fit really well so let's go try
it on this is the Minnie Mouse costume I
actually think this is really cute it
fits really nicely and I like the fact
that it has this kind of like a long
shape because of this net that's
underneath like obviously felt that this
would be quite like flat like this but
it's really nicely like raised which it
looks so cute this is what the neckline
looks like I think it's really pretty
and like feminine and it just look
really nice the only thing that I don't
really like about this costume is the
headband like the ears just flop around
so much I wish they were a little bit
more like sticks but apart from that I
still really love the costume I think
it's really adorable and it's actually
quite good next costume it is of course
a skeleton costume you card like you
can't do Halloween with our skeletons of
course so I picked up the
dress that's like got a skeleton kind of
print on it so it's got the ribcage the
pelvic bones and then like it goes down
into the legs I have feeling this should
have come with some leggings to go onto
these likes Calendar leggings but I
don't think it did I have no idea how it
will actually fit like I wish it was
like really nicely like cinched to the
waist and stuff but it looks quite baggy
so I'm kind of concerned so let's go try
it on
so this dress I actually really like I
thought it would be quite like baggy
around the waist but it seems to fit
quite nicely I definitely would love to
kind of make it a little bit shorter cuz
I don't really like the fact that it
cuts up here and then if I made it
shorter and awesome like the leggings
that have skeleton print on it I think
it would look really cool I think that
this costume is perfect for those people
who are not too much into dressing up
and going all out it's like a very
subtle way of being in the Halloween
spirit
this next costume I actually don't even
remember what it is I'm pretty sure all
the cases like a bunny costume oh my
goodness the headband is so cute I love
it already look at that it reminds me of
like Ariana Grande she's got that whole
thing going on with bunny
it also comes with a long gloves and the
main part is a dress I'm pretty sure yes
it is so this is like ooh how would you
actually wear this I don't really know
but the dress looks alright looks decent
and it's got like a ruffled bottom and
then also a netting underneath so yeah
let's go try it out so this next costume
is kind of ridiculous
I really don't like it I have to say I
mean it's giving me like really
playboy kind of bunny vibes I don't
really know why I picked this up I just
thought it would be quite cute but I
don't know it just really isn't like it
doesn't really sit right this is what
the back looks like feel like it should
be a bit more raised like if it had a
petticoat underneath but maybe it would
look better I'm not too sure about this
one but let me know down below what you
guys think of it the next costume is a
superwoman costume and this is what it
looks like I haven't opened it yet so
let's have a look inside so first up we
have these weird Christmas stockings I
don't really know what these are meant
to be I think they're meant to be like
shoe shoes I guess or maybe I meant to
put them over your shoes I don't really
know but this is meant to be like the
stocking okay so this is the actual
address and it has a little Cape up the
back which is so cute and the actual
dress is well it looks really short so
I'm kind of like oh this is gonna be
appropriate and that's very creased
and crinkled but hopefully it will be
alright so this is the next costume and
I'm gonna have to be super careful show
you guys this one because it is actually
so short like it barely covers my bum
like that's how short it is it's
actually really a shame because I really
like this costume apart from that like I
think it's really cute but then it's
just it's just this that lets it down
like it's so creased and so short
this is what the socks look like I
actually managed to get them on and then
over anyway I don't really know if
they're meant to be worn as shoes if you
were to wear these out like I don't know
so next up we have another Disney themed
costume and this is actually Snow White
I'm so excited for this one cause I love
Snow White I'm such a big fan of that
movie so yet again we have another
thought and then we have the little
headband which is so so cute it's got a
little bow on the side where how do
others
you can write Ascenta I don't really
know this is the actual dress and I feel
like it's pretty true to the character
pretty nice I mean obviously the quality
is a bit like cheap but you're not
really gonna be that bothered about
quality on Halloween because you're only
gonna wear this once like I said already
so for under 10 pounds I feel like this
is actually quite nice and this is the
Snow White costume I definitely don't
have the right hair color for this so
don't mind that but I don't really like
this dress
I have to say this is one of the
costumes that I don't think I would wear
because it doesn't really fit right like
it should be a little bit more cinched
in like this and then it would be a lot
cuter but because it's kind of like
baggy it just doesn't really make me
look nice and also can we talk about how
long this petticoat is like the actual
undergarment thing is so long I would
actually have to trim it myself do you
guys see that and lastly the last
question we're gonna try is take the
back oh my goodness it comes with a
little wing so these are the wings they
look so cute and then you get these
little like string things I guess we'll
just pop them around your arms as if it
was a backpack and now for the actual
costume this is the dress it actually
looks quite big like I got a size s and
this looks kind of like a size L sorry
no if this is gonna fit me so let's go
and try it on and this is the Tinkerbell
costume I pulled my hair up into a bun
together full let's think about effect I
actually really like this costume the
wings I mean the wings can be a little
bit better I'm not gonna lie like they
look okay but they're kind of a bit of a
nuisance like when I stand up front you
can't even see them now maybe also the
dress I actually think that the dress
could have been a tiny bit better I had
to tie it up like and kind of tuck it
underneath here quite a lot because the
dress was really long and it looked
nothing like this like let me just
quickly show you how it looks for real
like it's really long like this and then
like the seam is like down here whereas
I think it looks a lot better when it's
like kind of high-waisted but when it's
typed back up I think it looks really
cute and I definitely would wear this
for Halloween especially if your blondes
like you can really easily do this look
by just
cost you just popping your hair up into
a bun and you're good to go so those are
all of the incursions that I'm gonna try
out for you guys today I actually love
some of these I feel like I'm gonna have
a really hard time but picking what to
dress up as for Halloween now with all
