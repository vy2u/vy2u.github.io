today I had yet another Halloween themed
a video and this time I'm going to be
testing out a make costumes for under 10
pounds / dollars I've already done this
video at the beginning of the month so
if you guys haven't seen that yet I'll
link in the little eye up there but also
in the description so you guys can check
that out
but if you guys are I'm new I'm Roxie hi
you come and join the dinosaur family by
subscribing down below before we jump
straight into the video can we just talk
about my headband and also my top it
says which better have my candy I'm
totally obsessed with this table you
guys only get one I actually got on a
sauce I'll link it down below but
without Roberto let's get on into the
video so here are the full cushions that
I purchased for this video and I'm so
excited I have opened some of them just
because when they came I didn't know
what they were but I haven't had a look
inside so this is gonna be like a first
impression still I'm gonna put this
right out there I don't have high
expectations of this cuz they work like
10 pounds and under so yeah we're just
gonna roll them we're gonna see if
they're worth the money if the quality
is any good and if they resemble
anything of the picture in the actual
eBay listing okay so the first one is
this it's purple can't even remember
what I ordered to be fat I made this
order like weeks ago now so let's just
have a look oh this will be a Maleficent
costume oh my god okay I have no idea
how how this is meant to I'm so confused
I'm so confused is this meant to be the
colour cuz it's like really small I'm
really confused I'm sorry but this
really just doesn't make sense to me
what the hell I'm gonna have a look at
the picture on my phone because I really
don't remember what this is meant to be
like okay I think I got it so basically
this is the colour and it's meant to
stand up like that and then this I
literally have no idea what this is
meant to be this thing at the front but
okay let's roll with it and then it
comes with this little scarf that you
can just wrap around your neck and the
last thing it comes
is little horns a little horn hat where
a confident on this Joe stub take these
off and try it on I have a feeling
they're not gonna I kind of look like a
Viking these horns kind of look like
those are turkey hats you can get
Christmas and basically what these horns
make me think so yeah that's that I'm
very confused as to how this is gonna
look so unless you try it on okay so
this is what the outfit looks like on
and I think it's really funny actually I
mean the Hat really doesn't fit very
well it still makes me laughter the fact
that the horns are like so floppy to the
side this part here was the bit that
confused me so much because you kind of
have to like it
tuck it in it's kind of like this but
then you have to like tuck it inside the
rest of the dress so that it creates
like this collar shape it's so weird and
confusing but now my little collar back
here is very floppy
it's barely staying up and when you look
at me from the front you can barely even
see it I wish it kind of came around and
was a little bit like Wireless but that
you could actually you know see it this
hat should really have some kind of like
string attaching it around my Chin's so
that it stays in place because it keeps
kind of like flopping off I'll ask for
the dress I feel like it's kind of quick
body hugging I guess it's not really
giving me that much shape but at the
same time it's not too bad the thing
that makes me laugh about this the most
is the slit like the split is so
strategically placed right in the middle
or the slave getting too close to my
lady area which is too close for comfort
if I wore this on Halloween I kind of be
worried that this dress would rise up
and expose me but apart from that I
guess it's not too bad I guess it's like
some things that you could fix and we
didn't pay too much money for it so it's
not the end of the world but yeah I give
this movie costume a thumbs up so this
next costumer only cost me four pound 80
which in the grand scheme of things is
actually really good for a Halloween
costume
so this is
on which it comes in like a tight sealed
packet so let's crack this bad boy open
oh my god it comes with a huge hat I
actually feel like this is actually
pretty good quality for four pounds this
witch hat is actually really good like
it's better than those ones that you can
get from like power bands this is so
cute okay what's next so we have some
stockings I think yeah got some
stockings purple stripe and then the
last thing we have is the actual dress
so this is what it looks like it's a
very cute mini like colorful dress I
love the fact that the sleeves are like
Bardot but then it's also got little
straps at the top and then it's got a
zipper at the back so you can get in but
yeah this is that you're a really cute
no dress I feel like the quality isn't
too bad like I mean it's frayed in some
places but I'm sure you could fix that
and it was only for buy an ad so let's
be honest we can't expect like amazing
quality but yeah this is pretty good in
my opinion so let's go try it on so this
is the four pound 80 costume which is
absolutely insane oh I managed to get
this four four pound 18 the only thing I
thought I would really like is at the
hat and I have to say it's a little bit
floppy it doesn't really look right so
I'm gonna take that off without the Hat
I feel like the outfit is really cute in
regards of the gaps where I'll fit the
dress is really cute but it is a tiny
bit short like it's very short on the
back at the front but the sides are
really long just kind of hang across the
edges which is really weird
I really love the stockings is so cute
and then I mostly like the upper half of
this dress like I really love this
Bardot effect and another thing about
this dress is that it's kind of wonky I
don't know if you guys can see that but
it's meant to come to a point right here
and this is no pop fabric is supposed to
meet it in the middle right here which
it doesn't
so that makes the whole dress look wonky
as if I've like twisted it that way it's
like a manufacturing mistake but yeah it
just looks a little bit weird however I
feel like the costume is really cool
like the quality of the upper half is
really nice the bottom half you know it
could be a little bit better but for
4.80 or what can you expect okay
so this next one is another witch
costume actually so this is it this is
what it looks like on the packet it
comes with like a really nice long cave
that's pretty cute no I've just got the
cave I thought I came with oh oh I
literally thought I was gonna get this
in the post but I just got the cape no
they didn't say it's the Cape the
listing said ladies pup was with us a
cake no mind haha
it was $5.99 so I can't complain too
much I guess I could pair it with the
other witch's costume the other see how
it looks on anyways even though it's not
the full outfits over this is the log
cape I'm so gutted that I didn't get the
full witch outfit but I still really
like the Cape that goes all the way down
to the floor elephant like this kit
makes this outfit even more cooler so I
guess it's a blessing in disguise
well that was such a foul I thought I
got the whole costume but I didn't so
anyways let's just let's just move on to
the next one this is actually the last
costume that I'm gonna try today and
what is it oh okay so this is a
Cinderella zombie costume it's just like
a little Cinderella dress it's all
ripped up and torn I actually really
like it I think it's really cute it's
got a lot of like blood splatters which
look quite authentic they don't look too
fake or anything it's got like this
really nice a strip of sequin which I
think adds a lot to the look I've got to
say it's not the best quality material
but I mean what can you expect for $7.99
like that's really not a lot of money I
have a feeling that these little bardos
things might be a bit itchy cuz they're
made of like that really scratchy fabric
but let's go try it on and see but this
is the last costume oh my god I actually
love this one it's so cute quality is
actually not too bad like I thought that
this dress would be really uncomfortable
and maybe like to tie but I have to say
it's actually okay
I mean I was right about the sleeves
though they are definitely really
scratching really itchy but you're gonna
be wearing this costume for one night if
you do decide to get it so I guess it's
not that bad I honestly feel like
Cinderella Kunis dress I actually love
it I love the fact that it's off the
shoulders I feel like that's really
flattering and I love the fact that it
has these little sleeves because it
really completes the whole Cinderella
look one thing I do have to point out is
that this dress does not have a zipper
so I think she had to like wiggle my way
into this dress and I felt like some of
the seams were like snapping and I was
trying to get myself in this dress but
that's just one thing to bear in mind I
totally love this costume and I
definitely give a thumbs up so those are
all of the costumes I'm gonna try for
today that was a little bit of a fail
with the capes I'm really sorry about
that I genuinely thought I was getting
the whole which is outfit so yeah it
just goes to show you have to be super
careful when you're buying like things
on eBay because they make the titles
like really long sometimes so yeah you
just have to read it really carefully
don't make the same mistake that I did I
actually think that my favorite costume
out of these was the witch that I got
for four-pound 80 that is literally
insane you can't even get costumes that
cheap just in like local stores but you
can get on eBay that's pretty good and I
love the fact that it came with like a
bunch of things like stockings and a hat
I think that's really cute let me know
down below which one of these costumes
was your favorite and if you're gonna
buy any of them if you guys don't like
to buy any of the costumes I'll link
them down below so you guys gonna check
them out yourself if you guys haven't
seen my previous testing Halloween
