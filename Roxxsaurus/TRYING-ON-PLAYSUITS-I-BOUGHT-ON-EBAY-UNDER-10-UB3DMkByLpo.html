video is another eBay trying on kind of
haul and in today's video I'm going to
be testing out eBay places as well as
jumpsuits under 10 pounds I don't really
have high expectations after the other
videos I have tried on eBay like the
prom dresses and the Sun suits and the
shoes I'll link all those down below if
you guys haven't seen them yet if you
guys are brand new and you haven't
subscribed already please do and the
button is down below come and join the
dinosaur family I was love to have you
here I hold up before we jump straight
into the video I'm actually hosting a
two million giveaway what thousands of
pounds so I'll have the link to the
video down below where you guys can see
your prizes and also how to enter so
without further ado let's get into the
video okay so the first place - I have
to test out is this one here
it looks quite promising the fabric
looks quite nice I haven't opened it yet
so this isn't the first time I'm opening
it let's have a look fabric is actually
really like soft I haven't even opened
it like art because I'm scared let's
just open it up and have a look I guess
hold up what way no this is not side a
what wait why is it so wide I definitely
ordered beside a I just can't get over
the shape of this that's not going to
look flattering on anyone let's be
honest kind of dreading trying this on
now because it's not even life-size so
basically the actual play - is like off
the shoulders this is what it looks like
it's taken up like half the screen
because it's so wide it has like this
Bardot off-the-shoulder
effect we put your arm through here and
then it kind of like cinches in here but
this is oh you can actually tighten it
okay maybe that will make it a little
bit better and then it's got like this
back thing backless split I don't even
know how to explain that at the back so
I have no idea what this is going to
look like on but let's try it this is at
placing number one and
I actually have to say is not as bad as
I thought when I picked it up can it was
fun wide and really do love my side
however it actually turned out to be
okay once it'll like tightened and
cinched in it's actually not that bad
anything I would say that I don't really
like is this back bit here I'm just
hangs like really loose and I don't know
I just wish the fabric with a little bit
shorter like this and didn't actually
hang so much apart from that I really
like the shape of it I like the cut I
feel like it fits quite nicely along
like the way the only thing I would say
is that it is a little bit sheer like as
you can see there's a label here on the
actual place - inside and you can
actually see it that talked Shira is you
can probably see my underwear as well so
I don't know how like wearable is for
everyday I was kind of recommend to wear
it as maybe like a beach cover-up
because it is a little bit too share to
wear for my liking anyways but apart
from that I really like it next place
I'm going to try out is actually a white
one and this is why it's kind of late
day and for ypc in the packaging so
let's open your fabric up okay so the
material feels kind of like she pitched
a little bit and obviously I don't
expect great quality material from a
playsuit on ebay that's worth 10 pounds
but just so you guys know it's not a bad
quality
okay so this one is actually quite
pretty again it's a little bit wide I
don't know why they keep making the
fabrics they're like big especially like
this is a size 8 500 affect the size to
be this big when it's an eight-armed but
this is actually a really pretty place
too so it's sort of like they've got
these spaghetti straps and then it has
this thing that goes down like your
shoulders are kind of like off while
cold shoulder and then it has this
sleeve was like little frills on it
which i think is really pretty I really
like I think it looks exactly like what
it looks like on the model so let's just
try it on so this is please number two
and this is what it looks like on and
I'm actually in love with it like
low-key I love this place you so much it
fit
there's like no factory malfunctions
like there are sometimes when you buy
like eBay clothes this just fits really
nicely and they're really cute and
especially I'd like a bit of a tan as
things going to like make you turn pots
so much I absolutely love this little
off-the-shoulder detaining this is a
little bit of a close-up here oh the
only thing I would say about it is that
as you can see it just fell off my
shoulder because these bit here are a
little bit wide I have quite small
shoulders meaning that these things here
like this spaghetti straps have to be
quite close together this kind of like
bunches up here in the middle and you
can see if this was shorter like this it
would have been perfectly fine but yeah
that's the only like kind of critical
for my heart because it is so wide and
it like tends to form my shoulder line
and slow see the next playthrough I have
is this red one and this is actually a
two-piece jumpsuit so this is a top it's
kind of like off the shoulder Bardot and
very simple I don't need you wear red
but I thought oh I might as well go for
something a little bit different because
I always go for like pink snooze and
white so I went a little bit more daring
and I picked up this a red ones and this
is again a size S but this actually
represents its true size because it
looks quite cool it looks like a fine
day and so that looks very promising
and then the bottoms are kind of like
quarterman some leggings they have like
this thick band I've seen a lot of like
disco pants that look like this it's
kind of like faux disco pants
so this is what they look like material
is actually really like silky and the
band is quite stretchy too meaning that
you know if you have a little bit of a
food belly you can still pop see though
I'm just gonna trade on and see how it
looks so this is the next play suit and
oh my gosh I am actually low-key
assessment as well it really feels like
it could be found on like boohoo
or something like that because the
quality is absolutely amazing like I've
really loved this so far this is
probably the best thing I've ever
purchased on the ebay because I don't
know like eBay things are just like hit
and miss some time so I definitely love
the fact that this quality is really
nice and actually fits me right so let
me show you guys a little where the
close-up so this is what the plate suit
looks like oh well it's actually a
two-piece but you know what I mean so
this top is actually really clever
because they have like this best bit
here underneath but then you have a
separate thing to put your arm through
which makes it like really easy to wear
it means that it doesn't really slip off
your shoulders very easily either and
these are the pants they're really like
body tight which just means that they
fit super well around like the hip and
butt area and I just really love the big
so nice on so in this is what the outfit
looks like I think this outfit would be
so cute for like a date night or
something I'm definitely going to be
taking this outfit when I go to Portugal
this month because it just looks so nice
like it's still quite casual but it can
also dress it up which is amazing and
the last playthrough that I have is this
one here so it kind of like kinky again
you guys know I'm such a pain fool the
fabric feels quite nice like it feels
kind of like a pajama fabric if that
makes sense so this is what it looks
like it's quite big it's very long I
don't know if my legs are gonna be that
long oh cool I forgot about this it had
like a really cool arm
knee like slitted me design up and then
you can of course cinch it in at the way
to make it low bit more fitted
oh and have you got pockets too or that
so handy yeah this is what it looks like
so let's go ahead and the shredder now
this is the very last jump to this is
the pink one and I don't run in a hard
feel about it I feel like it's an okay
side I felt like it would have been a
little bit too big when I was holding it
up but now that I've like tied it up
cinched in it looks a lot better so this
is what it looks like I feel like it's a
little bit sheer by that I mean you can
like see the pockets and stuff and like
you can see my Brown my underwear
so I again I don't know if I would be
able to actually wear this out because
other than just to be a little bit
self-conscious you'll be able to see my
underwear through it but that's just me
I definitely would love to wear this
like around the house it's just such an
easy thing to throw on it's really cute
still as like PJ like casual loungewear
so I definitely don't feel like I've
wasted my money on this because I can
store use it indoors but when I wear
outdoors probably not there those were
all of the jumpsuits and places I'm
going to try to you guys today let me
know down below what you thought of them
overall I feel like this video was quite
a success because I feel like there was
already any disasters today in this haul
so I'm quite pleased with everything
that I got and I'll probably be wearing
the red one because I feel like the
quality and like the way it fits looks
really nice on me so I'll definitely be
wearing some of these and goes
differently see me wearing these you
guys would like more obey trying on
holes let me know down below what you
would like me to try on next maybe some
dresses I don't know let me know down
