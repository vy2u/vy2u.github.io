hope you guys are having an awesome day
so far so as you can see today I'm going
to be testing prom dresses that I bought
on eBay for under 10 pounds / dollars
I've seen this video like all over
YouTube it has been so popular lately
and it's so entertaining to watch I've
seen like mini TV where I've seen Sophie
Foster Aspen over and just a lot of
other people on YouTube so I'll list all
of their videos down below like the ones
that I've seen and since I really
enjoyed their videos I thought I would
give this a go on my channel and I hope
you guys like this so I went out onto
eBay and I've ordered some prom dresses
now these were all under 10 pounds /
dollars so I don't really know what to
expect I kind of have a little bit of
high hopes for it because the images on
eBay looks really good like they looked
really promising I just guess is down to
seeing whether the dresses will do the
actual images on eBay any justice if you
guys are brand new and haven't
subscribed already make sure you do come
and doing the dinosaur family the button
is down below also if you haven't
already make sure you click the
notification button which is like a
little bell next to the subscription
button I've never said to do this before
but youtube has been messin up quite a
lot lately and my videos have not been
going through to your subscription boxes
so yeah if you guys want to be notified
every time I post a video from now on
just click that little bow button down
below some of the dresses have already
been opened like this one as soon as I
realized that this was one of the
dresses I didn't see anything else I
didn't open it so this was me literally
seeing this dress for the first time and
this is what it looks like it just came
in this like white plastic bag it's
completely white and I actually can't
remember any of the dresses that I
purchased because I did it like last
week okay so this is a dress um so it's
kind of like Maci now this part is very
sheer like literally you can see through
it like can you see that you can see my
like background through the top so
that's probably not a good sign so far
yeah so this is kind of like a halter
neck design
and it's just got leasing at the front
panel its hide well at another button so
you can button it out the background
your neck and then it has like this
really long chiffon kind of space of the
dress I don't really know how to explain
it but yeah this is what it looks like
so my first impression of this dress is
that this fabric is actually not that
bad quality I expected this to be it
much worse and it's actually feeling
quite nice like the chiffon part the
lace is also quite nice it's just the
only thing that I'm worried about how
share this is like I don't know if I
would be able to wear this out just
because you will literally be able to
see everything you'll be able to see my
underwear underneath this oh yeah I
really don't know how this will fit it
kind of looks very big and this was a
size s okay I say this is the first
address and when it looks like on do I
need a fairly big like look at this cut
this is meant to be like a halter neck
but you can literally like it loose
you're not covering anything but the
middle part of my chest and half of my
boob on each side is literally out I
don't know how you can wear this dress
without a bra because I would literally
be so exposed right now if I'm really
wearing this new bra this waste pipe is
just way too low I feel like everything
should be like up like this um so yeah
the budget is just way too loose I feel
like if you wanted to make this dress
work initially just have to tie it up
like the lace pot here to make it a
little bit higher but even if you did
that I just don't think it would cover
it up much of your like chest area
although it does make it look a little
bit more you know cinched in and put
together but this is the reality of what
the dress actually looks like which
definitely is not flattering at all
another thing that I really don't like
about it is as you guys can probably see
half of the petticoat is a nice material
and then half of it is just chiffon
which is so strange because why would
you do that if you can see it through
this like secret material it just looks
really weird I guess the reason why did
it is because you know on the side a
little slit and this is the
sighs you can kind of really see when it
kind of goes apart they probably did
this to cut down on cost but I just
think it makes the dressing room bad so
yeah that's what the dress looks like on
I I just think it's way too share first
of all like the design this dress had a
lot of potential like I think that the
design is actually really super pretty
the neckline is really nice too but it's
just like the shape and cut and the fact
that it's see-through that's what really
puts me off of this dress but apart from
that like the quality is really nice so
I'm kind of let down by there the next
dress is I actually opened because they
all kind of came in the same parcel and
again I didn't really know what it was
so I opened it and I basically saw that
it was the dresses I obviously didn't
open them from the packaging so what I
could see is just this so I'm going to
be opening it for the first time now
okay so this is one of the blue dresses
I have purchased off of ebay I
personally had a blue dress for prom
which is why I kind of felt nostalgic
and I wanted to get some blue in that so
this is the dress right okay I swear
this is not what it looked like in the
picture like can we just can we just I
don't
mm I'm not a fan like at first glance
this is very see-through very
see-through like literally more c4 than
the other one I don't know how you can
actually wear this and we're going
online like you have to wear a bra
underneath right what would you do about
the strap since this is kind of like off
the shoulder it's just like literally
see-through netting like this is
actually fabric like there's barely
anything now that what's even the point
of it the material is okay but I can see
like the stitching and it doesn't look
great quality the bottom of the drain
ask yourself quite nice the fabric isn't
very cheap or anything so I really like
that and I love the color of this like
the color is just so beautiful from the
bottom down I think it's amazing it's so
beautiful but then from the top up it's
like yeah Ruby flash all around so the
second dress okay I thought this
wouldn't really
but actually fits really nicely around
the waist area the one thing I was
really worried about it half speed
through this area would be because
obviously especially just see-through
mesh and you can see everything I feel
like really exposed right now so I
definitely don't like it for that back
like I said in this bit it's just very
very see-through and it actually really
it she like-likes already scratching
it's so itchy because of like they're
like lacy kind of material so I don't
think I could last throughout prom
wearing this dress but yeah I think it's
okay now the next dress is this and it
miss she came in like her airtight seal
bag I guess they do that to make it you
know very like cheap to post through and
this is going to be so creased because
of the way they can set by the way this
dress here is basically one of the
dresses that everyone has been buying
for this video so you might have seen
this dress already but I got it in an
exciting different color than everyone
else I've seen so this one is like a
peachy pinky nude kind of color to add
first ones I got a size medium and I
feel like this might be a little bit too
big for me that's just you know my spot
though but the dress itself the top
looks really nice I feel like the
sleeves here might sit a little bit
weird when I'm actually wearing it it
feels very cheap like I can't lie it
feels much more cheaper than the
previous two dresses that I've shown you
I don't know if I'm going to get along
with this dress but it's very creased as
well so don't mind that obviously it was
like packaged really tight so yeah it's
definitely gonna be creased it's quite
shaped less like it's just very straight
down and I don't know I don't know if
it's gonna fit very nicely but let's try
it off but this is what the dress looks
like and I think it's actually okay like
from afar it doesn't look that bad but
when you start to look at it a little
bit closer up you see that like the kind
of neckline is a little bit weird like
this material is quite loose and it just
doesn't sit right in my opinion now this
altar area here is kind of itchy like
when I put my arm down the fit of the
dress is actually quite nice it fits
really nicely entire round
and then it kind of goes out of my head
but now that I'm looking at it when it's
odd I feel like the bottom part just
looks so cheap headphones doesn't
necessarily mean cheap so like you could
easily get really nice quality dress
from like Nuala or somewhere for like 10
pounds but it would not be like this you
can really see where the petticoat kind
of finishes I'm literally standing on my
tiptoes and it cuts off here and then
it's literally like the weirdest
difference of materials
I really do things that the petticoat
should go all the way down and then it
would improve the dress like by a
hundred times okay next up is another
blue dress so this I actually have
really high hopes for and when I saw
this online I was like this is literally
looks like a 60-pound wrestle something
and in the picture like it looks really
nice so I really am scared to like
unravel this and have a proper look I
have a sit together oh my god
they've actually really not that color
is so pretty but like look at the
material it's so like princessy I'm
actually really impressed with this like
at first glance it looks super nice
basically this is at the top it's got
kind of like a lacy top it has got an
under layer which I'm so happy about
because all of the other dresses
literally do not have that so you can
see right through you can see all kind
of booby situations and brass the lace
doesn't actually look that bad from afar
but when you actually feel it it looks
quite oh my god whoa okay so there is a
huge hole in the lace like what like how
can you send like a whole dress like
that is a huge hole in it you guys see
that that is like a full-on hole I can
fit my whole hand through that well
that's really disappointing this is
going to be like one of the best dresses
probably that I've you know bought so
far um I mean yeah I'm still happy with
it like I still think that it's a really
nice cut but I just feel like they can't
really be sending you dresses with a
hole in it like that's unacceptable but
on the whole I still really like the
dress so this is a No
dres now this one actually really
difficult to put on myself because the
back is actually fastened with like
these clasps to rather than a zipper if
you really like here like I said I think
the top looks a little bit cheap but the
bottom is really pretty it so like flowy
and really lightweight and it should
feel like a princess in it so what's not
to love and so far I actually think that
this is the best dress that I have tried
on this dress is so much fun it's like
if I'm making static energy sound so
yeah I think this is definitely the best
dress I've tried and the last dress is
another pink one and this one is also
airtight sealed which again is probably
for the bag that if you know cheaper to
post so this is the first time I'm
looking at it so far the material feels
like very thick it kind of almost feels
like a swimsuit material you know how
that kind of feels like very thick so
let's have a look look oh cool I really
love this so this one I actually got
because I wanted to change it up a
little bit and I wanted slightly more of
a cocktail dress for those of you guys
who would like to wear not a long dress
to prom but more of a short one so I
bought this one here and it actually
feels really nice it looks and looks
nice like the top is again quite similar
to the previous pink one that I showed
you is just like lacy and then it's got
the pink bottoms it matches my jumper
actually but yeah this is what it looks
like I think it's really cute maybe it
wouldn't be really as appropriate for
prom but I thought I would just you know
switch it up and get something a bit
shorter yeah I really like this so far
so let's go try it on and this is the
last round as you can see it's a lot
shorter than the rest cuz I obviously
want to switch it up a little bit you
like the lace is actually quite nice and
it's quite big quality however the
material underneath a is like this shiny
kind of satin and material which I think
makes it look slightly cheaper than it
actually should because the lace looks
really nice just on this barn and if
there was a different material
underneath there I think it would look a
lot nicer so the dress actually comes
with a really thick ribbon band as you
can make like a little bow obviously my
boat isn't great
I did it by myself but I'm sure you guys
can get a much better bow effects with
this definitely would recommend this
because the quality is actually quite
nice for the pride man and this is a
really nice dress that you guys could
definitely accessorize and add a little
bit more plug lamp to it so yeah I'm
really impressed with this one so guys
and those were all of the progress is
that I'm going to try for you guys today
I am so shocked at how bad some of these
looks and there was also obviously good
one I think my favorite one was
definitely this one here just because it
covered me up it certainly super well
and the quality is actually quite good
which I'm really really happy with let
me know down below which one you thought
would like the best one and the worst
one because I think the worst one was
definitely the first dress just because
you can literally see my side boob on
both sides and it just wasn't a really
nice design like it just fit really
awkwardly on me but that is all for this
video I really hope you guys enjoyed it
