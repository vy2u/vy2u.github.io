today I am back again with another obey
testing video and today I'm actually
going to be trying on eBay shoes under
10 pounds / dollars now do not put me on
this but I didn't think anyone on
YouTube has done this video before if I
find any I'll link them down below but
I'm pretty sure I might be the first one
doing this so I'm very very excited I
have got 5 pairs of shoes what a veil
and I'm going to be basically trying
these on like telling you guys what I
think about them whether they were worth
the money or not
they're like similar to the pictures or
not and whether the quality is there or
not yes if I look sweaty AF in this
video it's probably because I am it is
absolutely boiling here in the UK I
cannot cope and I can't even have the
fan on because you guys will be able to
hear it guys the struggle is real well
if you guys are brand new here make sure
you guys are subscribed because I would
love to have you here come and join the
dinosaur family we are so close to 2
million subscribers on this channel
which I'm absolutely over the moon about
I cannot wait till we hit Taylor if you
guys enjoyed these types of videos and
make sure you smash that huge thumbs up
just down below and also let me know
down below which pair of shoes with your
favorite I am very intrigued to see what
they all look like so without further
ado let's get into the video ok so the
first pair of shoes I'm going to try out
is this pair here I have no idea which
pair of shoes this is I bought like five
pairs and under can't even remember what
they look like so this is going to be
very surprising to the both of us so oh
okay um so oh yeah I remember now this
pair of shoes is pretty much like a
convert and of half converse dupe and
this pretty much looks exactly like the
normal converse how good is that they
look pretty much identical obviously
they don't have the converse look like a
logo at the back which I'm not too
bothered about that these were under 10
pounds / dollars which I feel like it's
such a good bargain you guys I will be
trying to honor you guys so you guys can
see what they look like and how they
kind of put for
when you're actually wearing them
because I know that sometimes shoes can
look really nice but there could be
really uncomfortable and it could break
within like two minutes but these seem
quite well made which I'm very pleased
about I got these in size five in case
you're wondering and I love that smell
of like rubbery shoes is that just me I
don't know I hope it's not just me let
me know down below if you guys love the
smell of rubber shoes as well
if this rubbery bit has smells the best
and so weird
also this is what the underneath look
like which I feel like there will be
quite good for like just everyday kind
of wear because they do have that kind
of sole grip underneath just pretty much
the same underneath of the shoe that
real converse have as well how they're
wrong with these that's such a good
bargain especially if you just want a
pair of shoes to like run around in but
you don't want to like necessarily spend
the money on real converse are
definitely going to do the job
oh my god is so hot I'm literally
sweating in places I've never sweated
before moving on to the next set of
shoes this box is slightly squished so
please excuse that it kind of came like
this in the post so what else so let's
have a look inside together oh okay so
these are like the faux Valentino shoes
that I'm going for
although these are slightly different
because they do have a chunky heel like
this but I really loved like this kind
of studded detailing so I thought I'd
give them a go and see how they look in
real life because on ebay they looked
really nice and looks well made and
stuff so let's have a little in-depth
look at these and see what I think okay
so now that I'm looking a little bit
closer at the shoe it's kind of like
weirdly indented okay look at this guy's
so there's like a weird maybe we would
see from this side like a weird indent
at the back and the shoe is kind of like
glued together like the heel and inside
here on the actual heel part it's like
look at this what the hell oh my god
these shoes are so cheaply made like at
first glance you wouldn't see any of
this stuff but now that I'm like looking
closer at it I'm like okay this is a bit
dodgy so I'm looking at the
knows well and I can see that the kind
of like studs aren't actually like stuck
on evenly they're like the meant to have
like a same amount of space in between
them but they're kind of like stuck just
randomly you guys look at that closer
you'll be able to see that like these
two are like way too close together and
then the other one have like random
space apart whereas they should really
just be you know even spaces apart then
you can tell mostly around this part
here as you can see the little studs are
so close together whereas here they're
kind of like a little bit further apart
I know this isn't a huge deal but I'm
just thinking about life when people
work really hard for their money and
they want to spend it on a pair of shoes
and they kind of get this in the post
they're going to be very disappointed so
you know I just don't really know if I
would recommend buying these shoes in
particular because of there's quite a
lot that goes into this design and I
feel like there's more like room for
mistakes when it comes to a cheap like
production companies like this on the
other shoe is actually a lot better the
actual studs are an equal distance apart
which I can appreciate but I just wish
the both of the shoes matched the make
of the shoe is exactly the same though I
can see that after using them like once
or twice they would kind of fall apart
especially the heel seeing as it's only
stuck on I like this it's like just
wrapped like the heel is just wrapped
around and like white plastic whatever
that is I don't know the way these are
sewn together is a kind of weird but
overall I think they look okay like
visually if you're looking at them from
afar the only thing I would say is that
they're not really worth your money even
though it's only like 10 pounds but
still I just don't think this point
buying shoes like this if they're only
going to last you like one or two uses
moving on to the third pair of shoes
this is the box they came in and I can't
actually remember what other pairs of
shoes I bought so let's cover oh I
remember these now oh my goodness okay
so these are some trainers that are
basically like faux Nike trainers I'm
probably going to get comments being
like why'd you say Nike it's obviously
naik but it's like tomato tomorrow
you know I mean like how LG's I say 90 I
say 90 but some people say Mike so I
don't really know Nikes like whichever
these are the shoes and they actually
look a lot like the genuine ones so you
guys think I'm not too sure which model
of shoes this actually is meant to be
because I'm not actually much of a
trainer where I kind of person but let
me know down below which which style of
shoe this is if you do know I really do
a love the design of this shoe which is
why I went for this one I bought these
and I thought I'm going to go to the gym
and if these are actually any good I
might just wear these because what's the
point getting really expensive like
trainers if I'm not even going to go to
the gym that much on the actual eBay
picture then I got these from the actual
nike tick had like a little white blob
on the end of this which I was not kind
of like confused about like what's the
point trying to make it look like Nike
if you're going to put like a weird
white blob I'll insert a picture here if
I can find it again but I'm very
impressed that it hasn't got that blob
because I kind of ruined it a little bit
for me the only thing I don't like about
this kick is the fact that the seam goes
over it to kind of keep it in place that
definitely tells you that the shoot is
ingenuine apart from that I don't think
you'd be able to tell if someone wore
this I can't believe that these were
under ten pounds like literally insane
because they look so much alike and
obviously I don't know if they'll be as
comfortable as the original one which is
obviously something you might have to
expect when you're paying ten dollars or
ten pounds for shoes or overall the
design I'm very impressed
they look exactly pretty much exactly
like the real ones next up is the fourth
pair of shoes this is really funny it
made me not going to open this because
it's a box from boohoo and they just
crossed out the boohoo calm on both like
on all sides of the box look at that
they're just literally crossed out
that's slow weird but inside I'm pretty
sure these are going to be the Puma and
fenky-fenky
I don't know I don't know anything about
trainers you guys but once I show you
them you guys are going to know exactly
what I mean here they are these are the
shoes
do you guys see any similarities you see
goofy and I think these look pretty much
exactly like the ones I see online and
like people wearing these all the time I
really love these shoes I love the
design of like the creeper shoe I used
to own a genuine pair of creepers so I
can really appreciate this I think it's
a really cool like way of making
creepers wearable for like the general
public who don't necessarily want to
wear like gothic kind of shoes I know
they're not gothic or anything but
they're kind of like associated with
that kind of scene of people so I really
love the fact that they made these and
these are so so cool I love them now
moving on to the quality of these these
look and feel really really nice they're
obviously not real suede but I can
definitely appreciate how soft and nice
to the touch they feel oh my god no I'm
just looking inside the shoe right and
they literally put a boohoo they let you
put a boobie logo inside the shoe but
like they clean not boohoo wait so
that's why they put like crossed out the
boo-boo on the box and stuff because
they're trying to make those shoes like
boohoo but they're actually not boohoo
just to clarify the emo shop that I
bought them from is definitely not
boohoo so I'm really confused as to why
it says boohoo in the inside bit but
it's very like cheaply printed inside so
I definitely can tell that it's not
genuine boohoo I'm now going to be able
to the very last pad that I'm going to
try on today for you guys from eBay and
this is the box they come in a very
large box so is that have a look inside
oh wow okay so these that kind of look
like that brand timberlands but they're
like Timberland on steroids so this is
what they look like they look so cool I
can't okay so basically it's got like a
really thick wedge like flat form I
guess it's called I'm on the very bottom
as the sole of the shoe nominal I just
from
it kind of feels a bit cheap like this
is going to get scuffed so quickly as
well made out of like weird faux suede
material but it's very like stiff and
hard and I can tell though the quality
just is not really bad there's like a
few imperfections on the shoe such as
like this little thing here which is
just a little bit of the rubber that's
kind of like not been peeled off
properly the actual design is amazing I
love this style of shoe it's so so cool
and like edgy the way the shoe is
actually attached to the sole is
obviously kind of like glued and maybe
slightly send me like stitched on but I
don't know how long this will kind of
last you in the long run if you were to
wear these like on a regular basis
overall I do really love the style of
these shoes I think they're really
really cool so I don't know if you guys
are just not that bothered about the
quality and if you guys would just like
to have a cool pair of shoes like this
but wouldn't want to pay too much money
for it then I would say definitely go
ahead because they're not that bad and
for 10 pounds of flash dollars I'm
pretty sure you would not be that
heartbroken if they did break one day
that is the end of the video these are
all of these pairs of shoes that I'm
going to try for you guys today I had so
much fun at filming this video and
trying out these ebay shoes for you guys
because I don't usually buy shoes from
eBay so this was like really cool to see
wish you I like the same as the pictures
and which are like not as good quality
as others but there is one pet I
actually bought from eBay a year ago and
these are what they look like I've had
so many questions about these shoes
there are a little bit scuffed now I got
these from eBay and they are literally
amazing they're such good quality I just
can't I think I paid like 12 pounds for
these which is absolutely insane because
it's so fashionable there's such like
good quality material they're really
well-made it just goes to show that you
can get nice shoes from eBay without
having to spend tons and tons of money
on shoes obviously some are going to be
like a hair and some are going to be a
mist but it's just all about testing and
trying and just seeing what works for
you if you guys enjoyed this video make
sure you smash that keep those esters
down below and also subscribe if you
haven't already because I would love
have you here come and join the dinosaur
family we're so closer to melt like I
said and I'm just so so grateful for
every single one of you being here I
really appreciate all of your support
but that is all from me for today I
really hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you very soon in my next video
