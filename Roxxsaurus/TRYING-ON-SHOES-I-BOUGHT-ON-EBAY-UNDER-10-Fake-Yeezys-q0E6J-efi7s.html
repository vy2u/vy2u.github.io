channel I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far so in today's video I
am coming back at you with yet another
ebay testing video but this time I'm
gonna be trying on some eBay shoes that
I purchased under 10 pounds at slash
dollars but you've done this video
already a few months ago I wanna say so
I'll link it and then it's what I if you
guys haven't seen it already and I'm not
gonna lie I was in love ever disaster
last time but there were some pairs of
shoes that were like indecent so I
thought I would give it another shot and
see if I can find any decent pairs of
shoes
Before we jump straight to the video I
quickly want to talk to you guys about
an app that has been a literal lifesaver
recently and I really want you guys so I
can get on the bandwagon and start using
this app with me I'm talking about it's
called 21 buttons so you guys can go
ahead and follow me on there basically
it's like an Instagram but for people
who are into fashion and stuff like that
I have something about this app is that
you can tag like the individual items of
clothing that you're wearing in your
outfit photos so that if someone's
interested in your fashion style they
can just like click on that item and it
will take you straight to the website so
they can purchase it straight from there
a lot of times you guys are asking me
where I've gotten something from like a
top that I'm wearing on my Instagram
photos and even though I tell you guys
where it's from in the comments you
can't exactly buy it and you have to
like still search for it yourself on the
website which is really annoying so this
app is super helpful to basically get
around that so this is my account right
here as you can see and I've already
posted a few outfit photos you might
have seen this on my Instagram already
but basically if you guys are interested
in for example where my shorts are from
you literally just click on the little
dot and it will take you straight to the
website and straight to at the item so
yeah that's basically the app that I
quickly wanted to talk to you guys about
because I feel like it's really super
handy and you guys should totally follow
me it's just a Drock Sawyer's as
everything else but that is enough
rambling without further ado let's get
on into the video okay so here are my
boxes of shoes there is literally like a
fricken
whoa mountain of shoes up here I
so excited to see it for one if they're
gonna be worth my money because I've
spent like over 50 pounds on these two
if they're going to be anything like the
actual photos and three if I like them
if the quality is nice and that kind of
thing there is actually a pair of fake
converse so in my last video I've got a
pair of like half converse but this time
I wanted to go for the full like
high-top converse stuff oh my goodness
this looks very promising you guys so
this looks actually a lot like the real
converse I'm not gonna lie it is so good
what the heck I literally bought this
for ten pounds whereas my real converse
I like fifty pounds yeah well I'm
actually gonna take my real converse to
compare these okay so I have my fake
converse and my room converse were just
so much more dirty so please excuse that
I really need to wash them but let's
just compare them I feel like they
honestly look the same I have the blue
version wise this is like the red
version but I don't think that really
matters much so this is the sole I feel
like they're very similar obviously the
fake one has a brown sole not a white
one but who cares about the sole yeah
logo itself is actually quite similar I
feel like the fake one is a bit sheepish
looking like it's not actually made out
of like this plastic material it's
actually like I don't even know how to
describe it
like the actual real converse is made
out of like this really nice like good
quality kind of material but this is
just like hot glued only kind of thing
visually it looks pretty much the same
but you know obviously I'm gonna look at
the details and the back of the sole is
a little bit different the real line
says All Star and then this one says
converse allstar I'm not too sure if the
red ones actually have that like because
obviously I've got the blue one but
perhaps they do on every note only thing
I don't like about the fake converse is
the fact that this I don't really know
what part of shoe this is like what is
this bit called
I don't know but basically it has this
converse allstar like tag and the real
one it doesn't even have that so I don't
know why they'd want to put something on
the shoe that wasn't
she's out on the real ship but apart
from that I think that it's a really
good like replica it actually says
combats inside it too
so if you weren't aware that this was a
fake compass you would never even know
like you've really would moving on to
the next pair I am so excited about this
one because these shoes have been like
all over Instagram they are so popular
right now and so many bloggers are
wearing them too so I was like this is a
really like popular shoe so I thought I
would get the replica because I don't
have money to be spending on the real
ones
so I basically picked up these Prada /iv
- I guess I don't know I thought that
this kind of design if she was a neat
ass I wasn't really I'm not really too
sure like I'm not a trained aware uh so
I don't really know much about trainers
or what they're called but I know that
this is meant to look like the Prada
trainers because of the B and then like
the little flag thing the only thing I
noticed straight away is I'm pretty sure
in the original shoes the actual back of
them were like different colors like I'm
pretty sure on this one was a green and
then this one was red obviously these
two are both red so I don't know let me
know down below if you guys know
anything about these shoes whether
they're meant to meet both for the same
color or was one meant to be green and
one meant to be red I feel like they
look very legit like from the side the
whole flag thing looks legit they don't
have the flag from the inside I don't
know if the real ones do either I think
these look really cool the actual make
of them they feel not actually that
cheap like this part the actual main
part of the shoe feels quite nice not
too like stiff or anything actually
trying them on now I feel like they
actually feel quite comfortable like I
didn't think that they would but once I
put them on they feel really like padded
inside overall I feel like they look
really cool I mean if you guys don't
have the money to spend on expensive
produce use like me then I don't see why
you shouldn't get these because they
look very similar and you don't have to
be spending that dollar next geez I am
so excited eyes well because these are
meant to be a fake Yeezy
so okay Wow they actually look really
genuine like they look they look decent
oh my god that's not really wet I
thought that these would be like really
awful and just tacky and they wouldn't
look anything like the real shoe but
from my understanding I feel like they
look kind of legit it's not just me I
don't know I don't own Yeezys obviously
myself but they look pretty damn similar
the actual sole of the shoe I don't
think it's as similar looking to the
original shoe as the rest of it it does
feel kind of like rubbery I guess but I
don't see how the real shoe would be
much more comfortable than this if this
is what the sole is like so I'm not
going to complain too much about that
actually feels quite comfortable inside
so I'm gonna give their thumbs up the
next pair of shoes is like a vans kind
of dupe um so this is what they look
like I'm sure you guys have seen these
shoes like everywhere everyone is
wearing these recently I'm not too sure
what style of vans this is there is like
a specific name I'll put it like hair if
I can remember but I feel like they look
pretty legit like the actual material is
like a velvety kind of fabric and
actually look really genuine even though
I know they're fakes but they look like
the real shoe which is always good again
I feel like if you saw someone wearing
these out you would not be able to tell
that these are from ebay for like ten
pounds because you know they just look
so genuine the only thing I would say is
that the sole is that she just stuck on
to the shoe by like blue it's not like
woven into the sole or anything so these
probably won't last too long and the
last pair of shoes I'm gonna try on
today are a pair of fake adidas which
actually came in an anti dust box which
is like weird because I know they're not
real so this is kind of weird
so these shoes are actually meant to be
like the superstar trainers I think
that's what they're called and honestly
they actually look exactly the same like
I'm not gonna lie they even have an
adidas tag that's really weird
honestly why they making it seem like no
real shoes because I know they're not I
paid like 10 pounds for these definitely
not real they they smell like fake shoes
but they're trying
look like they're adidas it's really
strange I heard that people don't fall
for this like because everything about
them looks like they're real so people
might be thinking that they're buying
the genuine shoes when they're not they
have the added US logo at the back and
they have the added ass logo inside and
they look actually decently made like
they look quite sturdy shoes have
actually been made really well I'm
actually surprised because they have the
whole Lite stitching inside the sole
which is what I was talking about in the
previous pair that they don't have that
I can definitely tell these are gonna
last a lot longer because they're better
made like the quality of them is a lot
better than the previous pair to think
that you can pay ten pounds for these
shoes where in store like in an Adidas
store you'd pay like 60 or 50 pounds
that's what she really crazy to me cuz
in the last video that I did a lot of
the shoes were a bit of a hare or a Miss
and like some of them just didn't really
work but these actually look really cool
like a lot of them were well made and
the replicas look exactly like the
original shoe and obviously if you're
trying to buy a fake replica of a pair
of shoes that you can't afford or you
don't want to like spend that amount of
money on it you definitely want it to
look almost identical to the actual like
original shoe I've gotta say how much
you're really pleased with in the
outcome of this video I thought I would
have wasted like 50 or 60 pounds on
these shoes but I actually didn't and I
feel like I will actually get use out of
them so it's all good I think my
favorite two pairs that I purchased are
these two because I don't know they look
the most legit I think in my opinion of
course I'll have all the links to the
shoes that I purchased and down below so
you guys can buy the new stuff if you're
interested but I'm genuinely pleased
with all of them I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and got to see one you can
buy for 10 pounds on eBay basically I
love doing these email videos for you
guys because obviously not all of us
have lots and lots of money to be
splurging on expensive items of clothing
all the time so this is like a really
cool way to be able to wear what you
really like but without having to spend
all that money you know let me know down
below what other eBay items of clothing
you would like me to try out next
because I feel like I've done everything
so far
I don't prom dresses shoes dresses place
suits and bikinis so let me know what
else you would like me to try and that
is
from me if you guys enjoyed this video
make sure you smash that huge thumbs up
it just down below and also subscribe if
you haven't already I would love to have
you here come and join the dinosaur
family also and go buy my merch guys
because I designed it just for you know
honestly I believe you've been wearing
this so much lately it's like the
coziest thing ever like this is what I'm
wearing it's a little bit crease so
don't look at that but basically it's
just so comfy like it's fleeced inside
so it's really warm and she just toasty
and now that winter's coming up I'm like
yes yes I have my merch website down
below in the description so you guys can
check it out if you haven't already but
