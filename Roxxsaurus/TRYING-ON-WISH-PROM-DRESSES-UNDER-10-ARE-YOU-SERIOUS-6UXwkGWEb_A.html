channel so in today's video as you can
see by the title we are going to be
doing a little wish haul but this time
I'm actually gonna be trying on a bunch
of prom dresses because I know that prom
is coming up for a lot of you guys now
most of these what under 10 pounds which
I feel like is very good because I mean
prom dresses are quite expensive these
days and I remember when I was getting
my prom dress I probably spent like a
hundred pounds on it which was super
super expensive for just one night so I
thought I would go and wish and try some
of that prom dresses out because they
are super cheap but we have no idea what
the quality is really like in fact if
you guys are having prom this year do
let me know in the comments when it is
like what month because I really want to
do some more prom related videos soon as
well I was so excited for today's video
because I have a whole pile whoops
other dresses to test out for you guys
if you guys I'm brand new here and have
never seen my face before make sure you
guys that come and join at the dinosaur
family by subscribing down below and
also don't forget to click the
notification bar to stay notified of
every time I post a new video but
without further ado let's get on in so
the first dress that I have is this one
right here and now I haven't opened this
yet so let's crack this bad boy open
okay so this is what the dress looks
like it's just like pure white and it
comes in like this plastic sort of
packaging hang on how does this go I'm
so confused okay so I think this is the
front so apparently this dress right
here was reduced from 70 pounds to 7
pounds now I find that really hard to
believe they look really really cute on
the model in the picture but I feel like
it actually doesn't look that close it's
basically got like a lace sort of detail
all over and then it's got like little
cutouts on the side which then just lead
on to the very bottom of the dress which
is just like long white chiffon sort of
fabric now I have to say as I'm looking
at the fabric of the dress it doesn't
seem see-through I mean only a little
bit but it's not too bad now in terms of
the quality it feels a little bit cheap
I have to say now considering this was
apparently 70 pounds of reduced down to
7 pounds I can
expect too much from it but I definitely
don't see this costing 70 pounds like at
any point I'm just letting you guys know
about the quality because I know that
sometimes you can buy things online and
you think that they're going to be
really great but then they turn up at
home and you're like why did I buy this
let's try it on and see how it actually
looks on okay so this is the first dress
now I honestly have to say I felt like
this was going to be a lot worse when I
first picked it up now I mean this part
here which is like the lace part it's
fitted quite nicely I have to say now
that I've zipped it up and everything I
felt like this would be way too big for
me when I first held it up but it
actually fits pretty nicely now for the
bottom half is just a little bit Caesar
you can see my black underwear probably
quite well so you would definitely have
to wear some nude or white underwear
with this now in terms of quality for
the bottom half you definitely would
need to iron this out because I mean
look it could've just looks like a
really crease like bed shoe or something
I have to say the fabric of the dress
does still feel quite cheap but I mean
it's nothing that a bit of I mean can't
really solve or maybe even like a
petticoat
this dress that does go all the way down
to the bottom it is quite long which is
really nice because you could work with
some heel no overall I feel like this
dress isn't actually too bad if I was on
a budget I would totally wear this to
pretend this is the next dress let's
crack this open and have
this is what it looks like I honestly
don't remember ordering anything that
looked like this it looks a little
wiener
I would be confused I honestly don't
remember buying this dress at all let me
check my wish let me check it oh okay I
see what you're playing at wish okay so
this is the dress that I ordered and
this is what I got I mean it's just it's
just not the same visit like I kind of
see how they got the sequins in and the
color but it's just not the same dress
like you can so tell the top half is
just literally a white little thing
that's stitched on to like this fluffy
sort of fabric I have no idea what it's
called and then you have this layer of
like sequin which is kind of just like
dangling over which I just think it's so
weird now it does have little like cups
for you know your boobs to sit in so I
guess that's kind of good again cost
seven pounds and I have to say the
quality actually isn't too bad of like
the bottom half but the top half just
looks a little bit horrendous so uh yeah
let's get right under see how it looks
so this is dress number two honestly I
actually quite liked it like I love the
colors and I love this like poofy bit at
the bottom but I have to say I feel like
it just feels a little bit wide like is
it just me or does this dress make me
look really wide in the waist like not
there's anything wrong with that but I
just feel like it's not very fitted to
my size like I feel like I could just
pull it and now it looks so much more
fitted you guys and see what I mean it's
bad things about this dress I think I've
got three and that is the fact that this
sequins are really super itchy
obviously the waist situation it just
doesn't look very fit into my body and
then the last bit is that the petticoat
underneath which is this like silky part
doesn't go all the way down to the floor
so you can kind of see
like my ankle's like really awkwardly
peeping through wish they just made it a
little bit longer so that as long as
this like fluffy bear it's not the worst
dress like with a little bit of
tailoring I'm sure you could get it more
fitted to your body
okay let's try on the next dress oh I
remember buying this one actually
because I love the nude color and the
sequin so this dress right here costs
only a five pound forty reduced from
fifty six pounds which I mean that's
that's a pretty good bargain and where's
the top and where's the bottom that is
the question hmm I'm a bit confused
what is this string at the back
basically it's kind of hard to show you
guys but it's got two regular straps
that go around your shoulders but then
it's also got this strap which is meant
to go behind your neck like this which i
think is kind of strange and you can
adjust the straps as well kind of giving
you a lot of like excess strap which you
can obviously cut off if you don't need
it now in terms of the quality I have to
say it's got quite a bit of weight to it
like it feels really nice and the fabric
feels really nice quality like out of
the two dresses that I've already tried
I think this is probably the best one so
far I love the sequins and the color so
let's try it on and see if this actually
looks good on the okay so this dress I
am actually obsessed nope I think it's
so pretty
it has really nice quality and it's
super long as well like literally look
how long it is it goes all the way down
to the floor which looks so pretty as
you're walking the only bad thing I have
to say about it is the fact that this
slit is kind of really extra like it's
super high up almost to the point where
you can see my underwear which I don't
know how I feel about that because you
know when you're walking around you kind
of just feel like maybe you might have a
little slip-up I just feel like the slip
would have been a lot more wearable if
it was you know a little bit thinner
like this but there is unfortunately not
enough fabric to kind of cinch it in
anymore or else it would be super tight
maybe you could sew it a little bit I
guess you could do that this is what it
looks like from the back as well it's
just got like a really dainty sort of
tie upper fake honestly for the amount
that we paid for this I cannot fault it
like is so gorgeous
okay so up next we have and this dress
right here which is just pure white and
has a lot of lace so I'm excited to see
what is I remember this dress wait whoa
no this isn't the dress what is this I'm
sorry
okay so I mean this is the picture of
the dress that I ordered and this is
what I got this is probably one of the
most misleading products on wish that
there is because I have seen it that
exact picture of that dress all over
tumblr all over Instagram like so many
times and I absolutely love that dress
well the real version so when they tried
to remake it they just thought you know
we're just gonna use the original
picture we're not gonna use this picture
because this is just horrendous that
this dress right here costs a 9-pound
ninety and you can definitely tell let's
try this on and see how it looks okay
I honestly feel like I'm wearing my
grandma's curtain right now what in the
world is this dress I mean does it look
anything like this photo I don't think
so
the thing is it has got this long tail
like the dress in the photo but it has
no shape it has no zipper it has not
even gotten like an elasticated waist
band nothing I'm just so confused about
this dress honestly like it's so
see-through there's no underlayer to
kind of cover my underwear and obviously
I should be wearing my underwear or even
nude I know that but still like it
should not be the see-through I never
recommend this to anyone to get this
dress because it is literally a waste of
money I know we didn't pay a lot for our
Syl I could've at least got a cheeky
nandos with
but now I'm stuck with it this next
dress costs 8 pounds and this is what it
looks like in the packaging so again a
little bit of sequins in there as well
last kind of impression is that it feels
quite nice love the color I think is
really really pretty now the top half is
just like really really sequiny really
pretty
it's got like a mesh back so you would
definitely have to wear like a sticky
bra like backless bra with this dress I
have to say this part of the dress right
here I thought this would be super sheer
but it actually isn't like it has like a
nice layer of fabric kind of covering
you up so you can't see your bra
underneath which is really good so this
dress cost only 8 pounds so let's try it
on and see how it looks so this is what
the dress looks like oh I am honestly so
impressed with this the only bad thing I
would say about it is that these parts
here are really high up to like your
armpit and it's kind of like really
scratchy and uncomfortable
however they listed the only thing that
I have bad to say about this whole dress
so it's pretty good I love how long it
is the actual underneath of the
petticoat which is this like silky
fabric goes all the way down to the
floor which is so good because obviously
you don't want like half of a petticoat
and then this kind of draping over it
what a hundred percent recommend this
one because I feel like it really looks
a lot like the photo and the quality is
not bad at all considering how much we
paid for it okay so this next dress
looks like this now from what I can
remember this was a lot more nude than
pink in the picture okay so this is the
dress now this is definitely a dress
that isn't your typical prom dress I
mean a lot of people at my prom person
II wore short dresses like this as well
like prom doesn't necessarily have to be
long like ball gowns but now that I'm
looking at it I'm not so sure I mean
it's a lot of pink it definitely doesn't
look like the photo now this did only
cost 7 pounds so can't really expect
amazing things but let's give it a go
okay so this
the next dress now I have to say it
definitely does not look like the photo
and I still really like it I think it's
such a pretty dress but perhaps maybe
not for prom like I said there is
absolutely nothing wrong with wearing
short dresses to prom I've seen so many
girls at my prom person who wore short
dresses like this but I don't know
there's just something about this one
that it looks so beautiful in the model
but now that I'm wearing I'm just like
it's not all that much really I
definitely prefer this dress a lot more
when it was like a nude color rather
than just like pastel pink although it's
still pretty color but it's just not
exactly what I ordered you know and this
is the very last prom dress that I'm
gonna try on today now this is
definitely a very daring prom dress so
if you're a daring person out there this
would be for you now this looks amazing
on the model in the pictures so let's
have a look at what it actually looks
like I'm kind of confused okay so we
have the triangle shape things to kind
of cover your boobs but then we have
this long panel right here which just
looks so unflattering it has got the
really long slits like in the picture I
have like a little pant underneath in
the under layer so that you can just put
your legs in there and you know you
can't see your underwear which is really
nice in the picture the panel just looks
a lot more flattering than this so I'm
kind of worried but let's try it on and
see how it looks now this is the very
last dress and I have to say this is
probably one of the most disappointing
dresses apart from the white lace one
just because I was so right about this
panel right here I mean what did I tell
you guys I just knew from the get-go
that it was not gonna be flattering and
I was right first up let's talk about
this little area right here which is
basically what my boobs are meant to go
but it keeps rising up so my chest area
starts here and these little panels
start halfway through which is not
flattering at all and then for this
panel right here I mean I just have no
words like it literally is just the most
unflattering thing ever
it doesn't hug this skin it's so loose
like look at that
another thing is the color the color is
just not like the photo the color in the
photo was like burgundy which was really
pretty this one is a lot more brighter
and now for the slits
they are quite high up but obviously you
do get the little shorts underneath
which is quite nice but apart from that
I would definitely not wear it to prom
so again I'm gonna give this one a
thumbs down so those are all of the prom
dresses that I'm gonna try on today I
feel like I you know tried a good amount
of dresses right here there was some
that were kind of like are you kidding
me
and others were kind of okay I mean if
you're on a budget and you're looking
for a prom dress I feel like some of
these you know it's a hit or miss but
sometimes you can find a really good gem
so I'm hoping that this video helped at
least some of you out and if you guys
