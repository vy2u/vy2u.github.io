say on runes and what we did in some
holidays so who wants to go first I'll
go first miss so I'm Chanel but all of
you losers already know who I am

high school she's typically mean to
others to feel better about herself
I hear her hair is insured for $10,000
and she thinks her daddy's money can buy
anything so this one will be my family
went for a little getaway in a private
jet to Paris and Italy and my daddy
bought me this gorgeous new Vuitton
handbag as an early birthday present

are you doing so in Oh me um well my
name is Zoey and I spent this summer

high school girl he was slightly geeky
awkward and loved stationary way too
much Zoey is your typical fangirl and

little gift for you oh thank you darling
so for those of you who don't know I'm
Vanessa and this summer I've been
studying for end of years finals because
I'm determined to get an a star for
every single exam if I don't get my star
I'm not going to get into Harvard I'm
not gonna get the job I want all the
husband that I like and I'm not going to
be happy for the rest of my life so for
those of you think that I don't have any
friends or I'm pathetic for studying
over summer I suggest you also start
studying now
you girls should take note from Vanessa
she's one of the top students in this
classroom and frankly my favorite this
kids me everybody why on your phone oh
sorry miss I was just taking selfies so
my name is April and this summer I've
just been working on growing up because
that's important and I've been hanging
out my friend just being Instagram
Bally's as you do in Starbucks coffee so
I don't have to prepare
I mean up all night must I try to get
the kind of kids because they just
restocked so I love this dog filter what
about what did you get up to this summer
sorry our campaign got my head
Inessa is the emo chick she spent her
mornings doing her makeup in a way that
matches her dark soul and her black
outfit um so my name is a Nessa and over
the summer holidays I've just been going
to concerts and gigs and about it so
that's my types of girls at school video
I really hope you guys enjoyed it and if
you did please be sure to give a huge
thumbs up and share it with your friends
on your social media and also let me
know down below which one of these girls
you relate to the most comment down
below because I'm interested to know who
you are out of those girls I think I'm
most to relate to the geeky girl as well
as the lazy and making a little bit of
the emo girl as well also I've recently
just filmed a really funny video with my
boyfriend Matt over on his channel Matt
Gibbs how did that video down below for
you guys so you can check it out the
video title is dating a youtuber be like
so if you guys want to know what it's
like dating in YouTube mode fo go check
that video out I think this goes without
saying but this video was a complete
joke I don't want you guys to take it
seriously or get offended and if there's
one thing I want you guys to take away
from this video it's basically to just
be kind to everyone and it does anyone
that is left how in your school and you
feel like they're like the geeky kid or
no one likes to hang out with them I
really want you guys to make the effort
to try and make friends of them and try
and make them feel involved I remember
when I was at school I wasn't the
popular kid at all and I just wish there
was that one person there that would
kind of try to invite you into their
friend group and make you feel welcome I
really would love it for you guys to try
and do that this year
I just know that you guys are going to
make great friends with that person
you're going to feel so proud of
yourself for making new friends and now
