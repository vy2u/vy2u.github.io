I wish Stuart and I hope you had an
eventful and amazing summer I'm going to
start this lesson with another
icebreaker exercise because we have a
feeling student joining us today whether
we are on a classroom and fair names and
what we got to over the summer holidays
why don't we start with you hey losers
did you make me so uncle but you already
know who I am
duh this is chanel Evans how do I even
begin to explain Oh Evans now Evans is
flawless and her she has two funny
purses and until Alexis one time she
push me in the face
chanel is the popular queen bee of the
class who loves all the attention on
herself but nobody knows that behind
this branch is actually very insecure
and unhappy so summer holidays I went to
my private jet my private island and we
had our hottest and biggest party of the
year with all my friends obviously the
ones who were lucky enough to not have
to be sitting in the courtroom of oil
losers well I hope have some toast fair
to do all of the homework that got given
what did you say to me
minions break it off you two it's
asperity of course and you're not going
to be fighting on the first day what
about you Vanessa what did you get -
well that's unlike some people I've been
studying all summer GCSE exams and I
would never let parties or boys get my
head Vanessa if I had a favorite student
it would have to be you

always forgot I got your problem here

seat over there tell us your name and
what you got up to over the summer
holidays I'm happy

get children from holidays I'm poppy and
puppy I'm happy I'm poppy I'm poppy and
puppies and pocket I'm high and party
and party and party ill man who is this
with okay okay I got enough um where
were you where did you get to until
holidays no way
so eat up service I was just wanting to
change or some conspiracy theories
that's so creepy any always wears a pink
shirt every video kind of like a
conspiracy theory in itself right then
you know folks are not allowed in
classroom Earl is a counselor way so uh
I'm going and this summer I Zoey is your
typical fan girl who's been to her
summer watching every youtuber every
show and every anime you could ever
think of
she is typically awkward and shy and she
has every meme it saved on her phone
just in case so she's ready to use their
the perfect moment online Zoe Zoe
oh so in that time is over do you wanna
go to detention sorry miss so this
summer
aya did all the homework and religious
that's exactly right it sounds wonderful
Zoe I'm glad you had a great summer
holidays oh I see we have another
student joining us today
what's her name we can rewind my name is
Daisy and today I am so so excited to be
joining your new school under the no
poisoning for the end of the day and
it's going to be the best offense would
have sleepovers in this case of Dora but
I'm so referral is this a week Jesus
someone save me from the prison right
now
this is way too much happiness for me to
handle it's like these little daisies
and rainbows are spewing out of your
mouth right now
look first let's make friends and after
you should be more kind to your fellow
students do you want to be no tension on
your birthday I don't think so
okay who next what about you April there
my name is April and this summer I've
been working on my glow up because
obviously that's important I recently
got my spray tan down in my mouth and
also my hair extensions so I'm totally
feeling myself now oh my god this
Sabbath is a totally bag to impress them
and the hashtag obsessed that sounds
wonderful
April hey next very much ran this is
Laura she's almost an organized and make
person you have ever met
what is this habit Lauri better have a
good reason as to why you ate one of the
first day I do miss I really do I
promise it was my dog he ate my homework
Laura you don't even have a dog
hey guys that was my type of girls at
school video I really hope you guys
enjoyed and slightly skin slightly
comedy later video
I absolutely love women with like this
as this is she took me like all day to
film don't really have you guys enjoying
it and found it funny flash relatable
let me know down below which one of the
goals are you guys are relate to the
most I think I really relate to Zoey and
also Vanessa and maybe even a little bit
of unnecessary all know I love like
white clothing so but yeah let me know
down below which one of you guys you
guys relate to the most quick disclaimer
please don't get offended by this video
I really didn't mean any harm by it it's
just a little bit of fun just a little
like comedy kind of skin video I don't
mean to be like stereotyping anyone
asshole I said this in the last year's
video if you guys haven't seen that
already make sure you do kind of like a
sequel of that video I said in that
video that one thing I want you guys to
take away from this clinic video is to
just be kind to everyone try and make
friends with people you wouldn't usually
make friends live at school that aren't
like part of your grooming I never see
anyone's at lunch by themselves or
someone who doesn't rehab as many
friends of school I want you guys to
totally go up to them and try and make
friends say hi and just make them feel
welcome because I was that person at
school I didn't really have a lot of
friends so I can totally understand how
people feel and where they're coming
from the last person you want to be is
someone like Chanel because she's just
so unwelcoming she's like the mean girl
of the school they definitely try to be
the complete opposite of her that is all
for this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed also don't forget to subscribe
and turn on the post notifications down
below I'm also having a giveaway over
Mobile for back-to-school
where I'm giving away a bunch of
stationery and an iPad so they should
definitely enter I'll leave all the
rules down below that is all for me I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye
all right way and you can character
Oh Lord sorry boys oh stop it
