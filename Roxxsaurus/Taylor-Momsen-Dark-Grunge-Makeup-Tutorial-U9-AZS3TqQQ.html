hi guys today I'm going to film this
really really extreme Taylor Momsen
makeup look I hope you guys enjoyed this
this has been a really requested video
so I'm doing it finally and yeah I hope
you enjoyed this and let's just jump
right in so first of all since this
makeup is kind of heavy we're going to
be using a eyelid primer and this one is
by elf and I'm just going to be applying
a little bit of that all over the lid
the part that I'm going to be using
today is the sleek eye divine or natural
6:01 and I'm going to be using the
darkest color from this palette and it's
the black and I think that this black is
really really pigmented so it will do
the trick first look and this is in
shade noir I'm going to using a flat
brush like this to apply that all over
the lid
and don't worry if it's messy at first
and you're looking a bit like a panda
because we're going to blend it all out
anyway
so once we've got a sort of base layer
you can take a fluffy brush and just to
try and blend everything out so there's
no harsh edges
to make the blending out of the black a
little bit easier you can use a brown
shadow like this and I'm going to using
this one from at the same palette and
I'm still using that as a transition
color to make the blending a little bit
easier
once you happy with how everything is
blended out you can go back in with the
black and just apply more layers to make
the car more okay
then I'm taking a big fluffy brush again
I'm just blending everything out
once everything is blended out nicely
I'm going to go in with a grade like
this and I'm going to be just taking
that on a fluffy brush and I'm just
going to be applying that in the nose
bridge kind of area to contour that bit
once the eyeshadow is done you can take
care of all of the fallout on your
cheeks and I'm going to be using a
makeup remover and a cotton bud just to
get rid of all of that residue
tailors skin is very very pale so I'm
going to be using the Mac Studio sculpt
foundation and this is one of my Paris
foundations that I own and I'm just
going to be taking that on my finger
directly and just applying that
underneath the eyes
and also any place where I have
blemishes now taking a foundation brush
I'm just gonna blend everything out
next I'm taking my stay matte powder by
Rimmel and I'm taking a big fluffy brush
and just setting my foundation in place
now returning back to the eyes I'm going
to be using this natural collection
eyeliner to just line my waterline and
get rid of any flesh tones around my
eyes
as for mascara I'm going to be using the
Max Factor 2000 calorie and I love this
mascara so much because it really really
gives volume to your lashes as well as
length so I'm just going to be applying
a generous coat of that all over the
lashes
now from the make up photo that I'm
using as my reference I'm not too sure
of Taylor actually contoured but I'm
pretty sure she does so I'm just going
to do that step but it's optional and
I'm going to be using this Avon
eyeshadow duo and the reason why I'm
using an eyeshadow duo is because I find
that these two colors mixed together is
like the perfect match for my skin and
the shadows are matte so that's why I
use this and I'm just gonna be using an
angled contour brush and swirling that
around in there and then tapping the
excess off and just contouring my
cheekbones
I'm also going to be the nice small
fluffy brush to just contour my nose a
little bit
now this look can pretty much be done
like this just slap on so I'm a new
lipstick which is a look less you often
rocks but her most common one is
obviously the red lip so that's the one
I'm going to be doing today and I'm
actually going to using two lipsticks to
create a red lip gradient so I'm going
to be using a lighter shade on the inner
part of my lip and then a darker one on
the outer part for the outer part of my
lip I'm going to be using this lipstick
by collection and this is in shade
revenge 3 from the Gothic grandma series
it's a really nice dark color and I use
this so so much it's one of my favorite
red lipsticks and for the inner part of
the lip I'm going to be using this one
by NYC
and this is the shade red rapture
so this is the final Taylor Momsen look
this has been a really requested video
so I hope you guys enjoyed this and I
hope I did it some justice so yeah if
you have any more suggestions for videos
you'd like to see like any celebrity
makeups then pop them down below and
I'll try my best to do that for you and
yeah thank you so much for watching and
I'll see my next one bye basically it's
this really nice cutout dress I think
the detailing is gorgeous and it's like
this chiffon II kind of flowing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
