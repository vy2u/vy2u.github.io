is obviously some hair grips I have
these ones from boots that are the
places to my hair color and some hair
baubles so for this tutorial what you're
going to need to do is part your hair in
the middle so - off off the center but
more or less in the middle and we're
going to take the first section from one
of the sides and we're going to braid it
in a Dutch braid and basically what that
is it's just like a regular braid but
instead of putting the shrimp over
you're going to put them under like this
and then you're going to do the same to
the other side then you're going to add
a little bit of hair into it and put it
underneath again and you basically just
repeat that over and over again when
you're braiding it try to sort of aim it
to ward's the back of your head when
you're at this sort of point where you
can no longer go to the back because
it's very awkward for your hands to go
that far you're going to have to sort of
change the positioning of your hands and
take it to the back like this so
everywhere this hairstyle is fairly
simple to recreate in terms of the Dutch
braid however the thing that is
difficult about this hairstyle is the
fact that you do have to braid on the
back of your head and change the
position of your hands and that's
probably what threw me off the first few
times I tried this hairstyle but after a
few tries I did manage to perfect it so
I'm sure you will - then you're gonna
have to switch the positioning of your
hands once again try to remember which
strand you sort of left off with so this
last transition of my hands that you can
see I'm doing here is probably the most
difficult part for me I'm not too sure
why I just find it very confusing to
like know which way I need to braid
which strand I need to add and so on so
I found that just physically saying to
yourself which strands you are on and if
it needs to go under or whatever makes
it so much easier for you and definitely
take your time with this you wouldn't
want to mess it up at this point because
you're almost done with the hairstyle
and all of your hard work would have
gone to waste
now what you're gonna do with this is
just wrap it around and then tuck it
behind you right at the bottom and then
I'm taking my bobby pin and just pin
that in face so once you've achieved
this sort of thing we're gonna do is
pancake the whole braid just to make it
a little bit more thicker and more
volumize so that is all for this
hairstyle video I hope you guys enjoyed
this and I hope you learned a thing or
two if you would like to see more
hairstyle tutorials and give this video
a thumbs up I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I'll see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
