tutorial is this really creepy Sleeping
Beauty makeup tutorial this video is
inspired by glam and gore here on
YouTube and this is my take on the tired
at Sleeping Beauty so first I'm going to
begin it by taking my L'Oreal true match
foundation and applying this all over my
face this isn't shade ivory because
sleeping beauty does have that porcelain
flawless skin next I'm taking the
blushed nudes eyeshadow palette from
Maybelline New York and I'm taking this
light pink transition shadow and popping
this in my crease this is going to serve
as the base of our eyeshadow next I'm
reaching for my Bobbi Brown concealer
and I'm creating a sharp cut crease with
this this I think is the easiest way to
create a cut crease now I'm not a
professional at cut creases so this is
my take on it and it's not perfect next
I'm going to be taking that same eyebrow
pencil that I used earlier and I'm using
this to outline the crease even more
this is going to give it a truly
cartoon-like effect using the same brow
pencil I'm now outlining where I want
the stretched out skin to be so I'm
basically creating little V shapes under
my eyes next what you want to do is take
some eyelash glue and pop this alongside
the V and then take some cotton buds and
stick this to the glue you could use
scar wax for this but if you don't have
any cotton buds work just as well and
this is just going to add some texture
to the face and make it look like the
skin is really stretched out once the
cotton buds are in place you can now add
some concealer over the top to make it
blend with your skin much better next
I'm taking a red lipstick this one
happens to be from sleep but you can use
any red lipstick that you own and I'm
basically filling out the little V's
under my eyes with this I'm then
reaching for a slightly darker shade of
red and I'm using this to kind of
contour the edges of my stretched out
eyes and make the flesh appear much more
three-dimensional and more realistic
next I'm taking some clear lip gloss and
I'm applying this over the red to make
it appear more flesh-like because flesh
is of course quite wet and kind of gooey
and gross so you basically just want to
replicate that I'm then taking my
Maybelline master precise eyeliner and
I'm creating a winged liner with this
then lastly for the eyes I'm going to
use some Maybelline falsies mascara to
apply to the lashes now for contour I'm
using my NYX contour palette and I'm
just basically sculpting my cheeks with
this as well as contouring my nose to
make it appear much more slender and
cartoon-like taking the same contour
shade I'm also applying this underneath
the stretched out skin that we created
this is just going to add some depth to
the makeup and really make it look like
the skin is really stretched out it just
looks so so cool and realistic I'm now
going to line my lips with the same
eyebrow pencil that we used earlier and
I'm going to fill this in with the vivid
matte liquid lipstick and this is a
really nice neutral shade it's very
close to what Sleeping Beauty wears in
the movie and this is the final look I
love the size so much it's so creepy and
really gross and even if you don't dress
up as Aurora I think you can sport this
look no matter who you are for Halloween
so that is all for my Aurora kind of
horrific gory version of Aurora makeup
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed this
