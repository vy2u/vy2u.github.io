channel I hope you guys are well as you
can see I have a very crazy look on at
the moment today I'm going to be doing a
Halloween makeup tutorial on this look
this is the tripi face makeup look and
this is actually inspired by the
gorgeous and talented promise fan here
on YouTube I'll leave Halladay down
below it was amazing I think I saw it
about a year ago and I was so so
inspired I just thought it was the
coolest thing ever
but today I thought I would recreate
this look for my Halloween series I am
so excited that Halloween is finally
like a month away or so so I'm going to
be creating so many looks for you guys
to kind of get you inspired and get you
in the mood for Halloween the reason why
I love is Halloween makeup so much is
because you can actually do this with
makeup that you already have in your
makeup bag you don't have to go out and
get any fancy face paints if you like
this lid please be sure to give it a
huge thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel if you're new I've already done
it to Halloween makeup loads I've done
Harley Quinn and the Joker and then I
also did a Tim Burton one so I would
really appreciate if you guys check them
out I put so much effort into them so I
really hope you guys like them I'll
leave those on screen as well as in the
description or the eye in the corner so
you guys can check them out if you guys
don't like this look then just keep on
watching so to making this makeup I'm
starting out by mapping out where my
eyes are going to be with a brown
eyeliner next I'm reaching for a matte
brown eyeshadow and I'm replicating at
my eye shadow with this as well as
creating depth to the eye so that it
looks much more 3-dimensional I'm then
reaching for a black kohl liner and I'm
emphasizing the upper lash line and
recreating my winged liner with a black
liquid liner afterwards
next I'm taking a white coal liner and
creating the white inside my eyes and
then blending this out with my finger to
define the eyebrows I'm actually using a
cream contour kit from L'Oreal and then
I'm going over the eyebrows with a black
kohl liner the eyebrows were probably
the most time-consuming part of this
makeup because they are quite difficult
to replicate since there's so many
different shades and shadows in your
eyebrows therefore making them look
three-dimensional and realistic is quite
difficult so you have to take your time
with this now I'm reaching for a dark
brown shadow and I'm going over my
crease to emphasize it and add more
depth once that's done I'm going to move
on to the inner corner and my waterline
so for this I'm using a pinky / orangey
tone shadow and again I'm applying this
with a precision brush I'm now creating
the eyeball so I'm taking a blue car
liner from Make Up For Ever and I'm just
creating the eyes which I'm then going
to emphasize with a darker shadow so I'm
going around the circumference of the
eyeball and just really emphasizing it
and darkening it up and then I'm of
course creating the iris with a black
liner to make the IPOP even more I'm
going to add that little glare in my
either you can see in my actual eyes
this again will bring the eyes to life
and make them look much more
3-dimensional I then returned back to my
black liquid liner and I just went over
the circumference of the eyeball very
lightly to emphasize the eyes even more
and then taking a felt tip liner and I'm
creating all the little lashes as
closely as I can to my realistic ones
I am then reaching back for my brown
liner and I'm now mapping out where the
nose will be so I'm doing this on the
bridge of my nose this part is kind of
tricky but you just have to keep looking
at your nose and how it looks and then
basically try and replicate that just
above it
lastly moving on to the lips I'm taking
the same lipstick that I used on my lips
so to make the lips look a bit more
realistic you want to create the shadows
and highlights once again so I'm using a
black liner for this as well as a white
one just to add that little bit of a
highlight to the lips which I'm then
just patting off with my finger so that
it's not so harsh and this is the finish
leg it's so say creepy by the way all
the products that I've used in this
video will be listed down in the
description so that was all for this
makeup tutorial I really hope you guys
