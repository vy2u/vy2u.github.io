by you just so pretty shup hope that
y'all with Wow honey no you don't
get the money I don't get hi guys today
I'm gonna be filming a tumblr inspired
hairstyle video it's going to be a few
hairstyles that I've seen on tumblr
quite a lot and I'm just going to be
recreating them for you to show you how
how to do them mythically so let's just
jump right in so first hairstyle is
going to be a bun but it's going to have
a little twist and it's going to have a
braid on the back of my head going up
I'll leave all the reference pictures
down below if you wanna have a look at
the original hairstyle so what you're
going to need for this is a hair tie or
a head bobble in my last video I said
hair ball a few times and everyone was
like did you actually say half of what
her bubble and basically that's what you
call a hair tie in English so I hope
that clears up the confusion so all
you're going to be doing is you're going
to be flipping your head upside down and
this might be a little hard to show you
guys to just bear with me all you have
to do is flip your hair upside down like
this and you're gonna have to braid it
from the back up like this I'll try and
show you to the best of my ability so
I'm just doing a voiceover I guess
because you can hardly hear me when my
head is upside down basically all you
have to do is braid your hair in a
regular braid as you would normally the
only difference is that your head is
tilted upside down but that doesn't make
it any more difficult or anything like
that all I'm doing is making it look so
much more difficult than it really is
but once you give it a go you'll be fine
it's smiley I hope you guys can see all
that and then you're going to lift your
head back like this into a high ponytail
as you would and using your head higher
you're going to wrap everything into a
ponytail so all the braids or the
remaining parts of your hair is all
going in a ponytail so at the back
you've got your braid and then you've
got this bit of hair that you are going
to take care of so separate the braids
and the hair and sort of twist it around
each other and then next what you're
going to do is you're going to create
that into a bun
it's good to use a hair tie that's close
to the color of your hair so you can't
see a lot and then you can loosen it up
a little bit just to add a little bit of
volume you know take some bits out by
your ears mister frame the face a little
bit the second head start is a slightly
different one and it's basically taking
these front sections and braiding them
back and then creating like a little
headband and the back of your head it's
really hard to explain so I'll put the
picture down below and you can check it
out yourself so I'm going to take this
front section here and I'm just going to
start braiding it this is going to be a
regular braid so nothing too crazy
nothing too difficult
by
and then you're going to repeat same to
the other side now that you've got your
two braids you can slowly start tugging
at it to make it a little bit more
volume eyes and bit thicker and next
we're going to take these two braids
around to the back and we are going to
hide these in here like just underneath
the braids hold on tight have you gotten
it's just
beau-line I'm doing this without a
mirror so it's gonna quite hard to leave
somebody watching your feet right and
that is the final hair site if you like
you can always curl the ends of your
hair nothing that will look really cute
and this is what it looks like from the
back
this next test is inspired by ariana
grande and it's a half up to half down
do and basically to space bones and the
rest of the hair is down and it's a
really really cute hairstyle so I'm
going to show you how to do it so again
you're going to section off two parts of
your hair so maybe half way down the
head we're going to take all of this
section and you're going to pop that in
a bun as you wouldn't normally side just
twisting it
but keeping you and let you get me
and then you're gonna pin that in place
just so it doesn't go anywhere and
you're going to take the other side and
repeat the same thing
and they were a really really cute head
start I think this is so sweet and if
you curl the ends of your hair it's
going to look even better but I'm not
going to do it because I literally just
wash my hair and I don't want to fry my
hair I hope you guys enjoyed this
hairstyle video and if you have any
requests for videos you'd like to see on
