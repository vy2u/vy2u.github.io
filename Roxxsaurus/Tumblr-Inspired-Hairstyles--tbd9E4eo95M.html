hairstyles inspired by tumblr I've
already done one of these videos before
so I'll link it down below for those of
you who haven't seen it yet and I hope
you guys enjoy this one so the first
time style requires you to get a little
parting my middle parting isn't very
even because I've got a wooded peak but
I'm going to make do with what I've got
and I'm going to separate my hair into
two sections like this and I'm going to
separate it all down the back as well
and then I'm going to do is I'm going to
start braiding it with a regular braid
so separating the hair into three
sections I'm just starting to braid it
and I'm going to try and position these
braids a little bit off to the back
because I feel like that works best for
this hairstyle
once I'm done I'm going to take a hair
elastic that's close to my hair color
and I'm going to just secure that whole
braid into place and then I'm just going
to repeat the same to the other side
next once you've got your braids all
done you can sort up separate them a
little bit if you like just to give them
a little bit more texture and volume and
then what you do is you take each braid
and you just pull it up over your head
like this then you take some bobby pins
and just pin it in place just that
next we're gonna do is you're going to
hide this part of your hair and the hair
tied with the other braid like so
and this is what the finished hairstyle
looks like you have to be really careful
that you don't see the hair ties that
are hidden behind the braids and
sometimes this hair so I can make your
head look a little bit big so make sure
that your braids are really pinned down
to your head especially these bits here
and yeah you can just pull out a little
bits of like hair just to frame the face
a little bit better whatever you wish
and I think that this is a really nice
hairstyle it's very like classy and get
your hair out of the way and it's very
very easy and simple to do but it looks
like you put a lot of effort into it
excuse the crimped hair guys it just
happened because I had the braids in for
a while this next hairstyle is a hassle
that I do really really often and it's
basically the top bun that's like a half
updo half down do so the rest of your
hair is down it's a really really simple
hair start and anyone can do it but some
of you have been asking me how I do it
so I'm just going to show you quickly
how I do it in this tutorial so
basically all you do is you take the top
section of your hair I usually take it
from around where my eyebrows start and
I do with my thumb's like this I go all
the way to the back and I grab the top
section of my hair all together next I
just saw get rid of the parting because
it looks a bit weird the parting and I
take all the hair right at the top of my
head
for time in the hair in place I
recommend having a scrunchie I'm just
going to use my black scrunchie and I'm
going to just gather all the hair and
then I'm going to tie a few times not
too tight because after a while I find
that it starts hurting your head and so
I try to keep it as loose as possible
and because now we've got the scrunchie
we can actually work with this and
create the bun around the scrunchie
which gives like extra volume to the bun
especially because you're obviously not
using your whole head of hair and then
all I do is wrap it into a little bun
shape and then a you
a regular hair tie and just tie it into
place now at this point all you have to
do is sort of form it to your liking I'm
just gonna leave it like this and what I
usually do then is I take this bit of
hair and I sort of pull it out just to
add a little bit more volume because I
find that it looks a little bit squashed
once you put it into the high ponytail
so I just like to mess it up a tiny tiny
bit and then pull out a little bit to
pair around it just to frame the face
and just make it look much um more messy
so that's a luncheon for my half updo
your half down do top bun hairstyle it's
really really simple and easy and
literally anyone can do it this next
hairstyle is a half down do half updo
and it's basically a bow at the back of
your hair and it's a really really nice
hairstyle especially with curled hair so
I'm just going to show you how to do it
real quick so all you do is you take the
upper section of your hair just like you
did in the previous hairstyle and you
take it to the back of your head like so
and then all you do is tie it in place
and then when you're on the last tie all
you do is you pull it but you don't pull
it all the way through creating this
little tiny bug like this next you take
the bun and separate it into two
sections like so
once you've separated it you can pin it
into place with the Bogota
once you separated the little bun all
you have to do is making this hole just
above the head type where you tied the
whole thing into place if you can see
that just here and what you do then is
you take the remaining section of your
hair and loop it through that hole in
the middle of the bow next all you have
to do is pin everything into place
and the last tutorial is twin buns or
space buns as some people call it and I
really really love this hairstyle is
really fun and quirky so I want to show
you how I do it
so I separate my hair into a middle
parting once again doesn't have to be
like the neatest thing ever and then I
split my Heretic to bits and I grabbed
one section pull it up as if always to
create a high ponytail
when I repeated the same to the other
side and once you have two ponytails you
can now form them into a bun
and then I'm just going to repeat the
same to the other side now you can use a
few bobby pins just to support the bug
in place so this is the final hairstyle
I hope you guys like it
it's very hard to do on my head because
my hair is long but I'm sure for those
of you who have shorter or medium length
head and this will be much easier for
you so that's all for my hair tutorial I
