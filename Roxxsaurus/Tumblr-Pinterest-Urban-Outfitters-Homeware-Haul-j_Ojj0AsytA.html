channel I hope you guys are all well
there today I've got a slightly
different video for you guys because I
don't think I actually have filmed a
home kind of haul video for you guys
before so I'm super super excited and I
hope you guys enjoy app you guys have
never seen my face before make sure you
hit that subscribe button and join the
dinosaur family also I'm having a
back-to-school giveaway at the moment as
well as a MacBook Pro giveaway you
giveaways at the same time kind of crazy
but I hope you guys love it I'll leave
all the rules down below and how you can
enter and also the video in where I
showed you all the things that you can
win and win a MacBook Pro the only rule
is to be subscribed to this channel as
well as my vlog channel called Rock so
as vlogs so I think that's pretty easy
if I say so myself
so without further rambling let's jump
into the video ok so I was really
naughty and I went on the Urban
Outfitters website recently and I picked
out a loan stuff so I'm just going to
show you guys what I picked out for my
new house because we are still in the
process of like making it homely and
cozy and it is very difficult and I
think it's all in the finishing touches
so I basically went through the website
I just picked out a load of things and
little bits and bobs that kind of will
make my home a little bit all homely so
the first thing I picked up is this
speech bubble light box and this is so
so cool it's a totally at home on it but
you can of course write whatever you
like I'm actually thinking of using this
in the background of my future videos
when I actually sort out my filming room
and have like rocks or is written on it
or something I don't know yet
but yet super super cool the next thing
I picked up is this crescent moon of
mirror so it looks like this I'll get
out of the box to show you guys so it's
literally a simple mirror and you can
see yourself in there hey and yeah just
really loved it it's just so like quirky
kind of simplistic but also kind of
different so I thought why not pick it
up the next two bits that I got our
frames they're kind of like really
industrial and our living room is
actually super industrial kind of themed
so I thought these would go perfectly
and I love black and I love copper so
how could I not have picked these up I
just not they're really cool like
intricate design on them they're really
different but like really cool at the
same time they're very
Tumblr and Pinterest the next thing I
picked up is this cute little box but
wait it's not actually a box it's a
candle so thank you and the smells
amazing this was 15 pounds and I feel
like for the box that it's so worth it
like for the packaging of this candle
because it's just so cute just look at
it it's so so pretty and I just had to
have it's as copper again
I love Kalpana look I can never have
enough copper by the way guys I'm going
to list down all the prices of these
down below in the description because I
don't remember how much all of these
cost but yeah they're all down below the
next thing I picked up is this little
shelf it's very very simplistic it's
literally a little plank of wood and a
metal kind of light high anything I
guess so you just place it on top like
this and I think it's super super cute
just for like a little accent to the
room I might actually put this in my
hallway and maybe put like a few candles
on there or like a little ornament and
this was 15 pounds which again it's
super good for a really cool and unique
piece that you can add to your home the
next thing I got is this really cute
little mirror again I'm just really like
looking for corn mirrors I can place
around the house and kind of add a
little bit more character to the home so
I went for this one and it's like a gold
chained kind of like hanging one so it
looks like this it's really small but I
thought like just to have like a few of
them or maybe like this and lo picture
frames around it would look quite cool
and this was 22 pounds the next thing
that I picked up is this jewelry box and
it's like kind of mirrored it's mirrored
on the inside and it's see-through glass
with like copper accents all around it
and I love it so so much I'm really
excited to sort my filming room out soon
so then I can put this on my desk and
just put a bunch of like jewelry or
maybe even makeup inside the next thing
I got is another like quite quirky
novelty kind of thing and it's this why
is this like a black cinematic light box
with 85 black letters numbers and
symbols so this is what it looks like
and you
we seen a lot of youtubers actually
owning stuff like this and its really
like popular and kind of on trend at the
moment so I mean I don't know what I'm
actually going to use this or like to
write but I really liked it so how to
get it and this was 32 pounds and
considering it's 85 letters you can
initially write anything you like so you
can change up all the time so the next
thing I got is for the bathroom and it's
a bummer that says goodbyes it's really
really simple just you know adult things
like just fun ways to spice up a regular
boring bathroom you know so this was how
much was this this was 25 pounds which i
think is pretty fairly priced for all
over really cool bath mat you know the
next thing I got is this set of bowls
and marks and these are so so cute they
remind me of like Little Mermaid because
I don't know if you can see but the
texture of these is so so cool it's kind
of like fishtail texture and the color
is amazing it's just so bright and fun
and colorful and I actual like set of
bowls and plates and stuff like that is
actually just gray so I thought I have
to introduce some color into the kitchen
where because I can't have everything in
gray as much as I love gray and you guys
can probably tell that I love Gregg's
everything around me is pretty much grey
I can't have great everything you know
so I thought with little bits like this
I could add some color and just make it
a little bit more fun and bright and
colorful the next thing I picked up is
this cushion and I really love the
design on this and colors and again like
I said I really want to introduce some
color into my house so I had to pick
this up and it's just really cool like I
really love the intricate design of it
and it's very like indie kind of hippie
vibes I don't really know but this was
28 pounds and yeah it's just a really
nice pillow and it's really really soft
as well I then picked up some fairy
lights because you can't be a youtuber
and not get fairy lights obviously so
these are the celestial lights and this
is what they look like ah they're like
copper stars it's not really like simple
but they're really cute the next thing
that I got is this copper over the door
towel rack we don't actually have a
towel rack yet so I'm
hoping this will actually fit over the
door properly but yeah this was 20
pounds which is pretty good and I'm
super sorry guys but most of the things
that you're going to see in my house are
gonna be copper so yeah just waiting for
the hospital it's just going to be
copper galore guess what the color of
the next thing is copper so this is a
copper wire wall grid and I have been
wanting one of these for so long just
add like little cute Polaroids and you
know notes and just things like that to
it and I am so excited to finally get my
hands on one of these because I'm gonna
place this in my film Uemura and I think
it's going to look super super cute the
next thing I picked up is this shelf
hook hanger thing Thank You Skye thank
you for that if you connect it like this
and the last thing that I got is this
really big poof for the lounge just
because we sometimes like sitting on the
floor and it's very uncomfortable so we
thought we would grab one of these and
make if you just be able to chill out by
the coffee table and the last thing that
I got is definitely the splurge item of
this haul and this was I think a hundred
pounds and this is basically like an
industrial side table and I place this
next to my sofa in the lounge and I just
picked up like a few picture frames and
candles and ornaments and place this
onto the desk and I just think it ties
the whole living room together it just
looks so so cool and it's a nice way to
display my very many candles which I
probably should stop buying so that is
all for my home haul I really hope you
guys enjoy it and if you want to see a
house tool make sure you leave a thumbs
