welcome back to my channel so in today's
video I thought I would do the ugly
location photoshoot challenge we're
going to be taking on the challenge and
I'm super excited for this because I
actually did take photography at college
so I feel like it's taken two of my kind
of like hobbies and just merging them
together cuz I love photography and I
love YouTube so boom great video idea I
just have to say this video idea is mine
of course I've seen so many different
youtubers do this video already so yeah
I really hope you guys enjoy just so you
guys know I will be posting all of the
photos that I have taken in this video
over on my Instagram see if you guys
don't follow me already you know what to
do and if you guys are brand new here
and have never seen at this face before
do make sure you come and subscribe or
come and join the dinosaur family but
anyways it without perfer ambling let's
get on into the first location okay so
for the first location where outside
Bunnings now Bunnings is kind of like a
DIY slash hardware store it's not really
your typical place where you'd be taking
like an Instagram photo so we're gonna
see what we can do I've got Matt helping
me out
yeah does Nate photographer a seminar so
we're gonna see what we can do let's go
okay so we're inside I honestly have no
idea where I'm gonna take this photo cuz
I mean look around there's like tools
and stuff so I don't know if this is
gonna click Instagram abort and I
actually have to post this photo on my
Instagram so I definitely want it to
look good I'm definitely not gonna be
taking a photo with a pressure washer
that's for sure
Oh because someone just said it might be
maybe with like all of these in the
background I don't know okay we're
outside now in the garden like said
Tibet
I was just thinking this because I
thought here a crouch down and you were
looking through these it would be like
green in the distance we moved a plant
and put it yeah let's try that oh that
was cool
I like ah that's a little ugh like I'm
in a garden center
raise your possum oh never better
yeah you got a little higher the things
you do for a fight time oh this is a hug
my knees okay this is like a leg workout
if he could just got a little higher but
actually card oh my god this is like me
proper squat right can you see ya
since the photos are turning out so good
we thought we would pose in front of
like this tree because it looks a little
bit more tropical instead of wearing my
tropical hat today I thought it would be
like a really decent location to take
phones out so gonna try it now
okay so we've just finished taking the
photos and Bunnings I did actually get
told off for taking photos in there so
we didn't actually get that many I feel
like whatever we actually did get did
look quite cool so let's go back inside
and see how the photos turned out okay
so this is probably my favorite fighter
that I have taken throughout this whole
video because you cannot tell that I
took it in a hardware store it kind of
just looks like I'm Romie like a jungle
or something like tropical vibes you
could not tell that I'm literally in the
UK in Bunnings I don't Matt did such a
good job with this photo I wanna see
they're not expect it to look like this
I'm actually really excited to post this
on my Instagram and to think that I took
this in an ugly location is just a
mind-blowing I also took a couple of
other photos like this one I actually
really like this one because again you
can't already tell that I'm in a
hardware store it just looks like I'm in
some park or in like a tropical
rainforest I have no idea and then I
also do have the photo where I took it
in front of like the little kind of like
paint samples and I don't really like
how this one turned out per se but I
think it's a cool idea maybe if we had a
little bit longer to take the photo then
this would have come out well but the
fact that we were very rushed and like
this paint section was by the tills and
by that point I already got told off
like once for filming inside so we were
just like quick take the photo and this
is the outcome but I feel like it's not
that bad but it's just not one of my
favorites so anyways let's take a look
at location number two so this is the
next location this is kind of like the
recycling bins where people put like
clothing for charities and stuff I
honestly have no idea how we're gonna
make this work to be fair but let's try
it do you have any ideas how we can do I
honestly have no clue well why don't you
try and stand in between the two poles
there
I want to like act cool and cash but I
don't have them so not cool someone was
literally just spinning like glasses
tongue man where does it take him fire I
think I look good cuz I was using the
green here in the bottom corner it's
like an angle it's not straight on it's
like edgy oh my god you never think I
was taking a pee no that's cool so as
you guys saw that was the next location
I honestly did not think that I was
gonna get a cute photo from this
location whatsoever
it lets you was just like a bunch of
recycling bins and I don't know that's
just not really an Instagram bubble
arrogant to take a photo to be honest
but this is the outcome and I'm actually
so proud of these this is my favorite
shot from that hole location I just love
it so much I don't know why I just love
the colors you can't really tell that
I'm by like a recycling bin but you can
just kind of see that something is going
on I really like this one I kind of like
how edgy it looks and then the next one
is this one I love the composition of
this that Matt took it in it's very like
obscure like you can't really tell
what's going on there's that green bit
of like that green bin on the side and
it just looks really cool I also tweaked
the color of the red bin behind me just
to make it a little bit different I made
it like a bit more pink than red and I
really like this again and the last one
I have is from the first kind of like
location on site with all the bins
behind me and again this is a really
nice shot I feel like whenever you blow
out the background it really doesn't
matter where you are out of course you
can still kind of make out where I am
which obviously isn't the best location
but somehow we made it work let me know
which one of those photos was your
favorite 1 2 or 3 go comment right now
but now let's move on to location number
3 okay so the next location is Tesco I
thought that this would be kind of an
ugly location to take photos but I
thought I would kind of spice it up with
my outfit
I'm going for like an American type of
feel vibe I've got my diner bag which I
literally just grabbed from like
yesterday when we went to the diner and
also have a signature coke can would
like a look a straw and yeah we're dozen
there to try and make this look here
somehow okay so what we're gonna do is
gonna climb up this hill where there's
like loads of flowers and stuff and
there's a Tesco sign right in the
background so we're hoping I'm gonna be
able to find a cool photo
I kind of feel like I'm trespassing by
like going there you do to get better
so we are finished that was really
interesting I didn't think I could get a
good photo at Tesco but here we have
here let's take a look at the photos
okay so that one location at number
three now honestly I am sure and how
this turned out I feel like I
coordinated my outfit pretty well to the
location cuz there's like the Reds and
the blues in the Tesco logo they really
like my outfit in this one I think
that's my favorite outfit of the whole
video but yeah the fact that moves like
daisies on site like by Tesco just made
it so much better
I definitely got prickled a little bit
on the way up because there was a lot of
like steamed letters but that's okay I
got I'll do it for the gram and yeah I
really like these I definitely would
actually post this on my Instagram again
which is so strange because I've never
thought I'd be posting a photo with
Tesco in the background so now let's
move on to the final location which is
location number four okay so this is
location number four I am absolutely
freezing in this outfit I honestly
didn't realize how cold it was now but
the Sun has just gone in so so cold but
the location is basically like a back of
the store I do see some color over there
that I'm really hoping that I can kind
of make it work so let's make some magic
and I got dropped by someone think that
it wasn't safe so we didn't actually
manage to get a few cool shots so let's
go have a look at location number four
was honestly the hardest one of the lot
because it was just so ugly back there
like I had no idea how to make this work
but I honestly felt like Matt really
helped me out with this one because he
was like oh look there's some color here
so maybe we can do like a blurry sort of
like color thing in the background and
then we could do like kind of like a
side shot so that's kind of when we took
this photo and I honestly really liked
this again you could not tell like the
general location where I'm at but you
can definitely see that I'm kind of in
like a rustic sort of place it looks a
little bit rough but not too rough if
that makes sense and I don't know I just
really liked this photo I would never
think to take a photo like in that
location with that sign behind me but I
feel like it really worked we then took
another one which I don't really like as
much it's kind of like where you can see
more of the general area but it's a
little bit blurry you can still kind of
make out where I am but not too much and
then the last shot is this one this is
my favorite from that location just
because I love how the retro Lee is like
corresponding with my red top I think
that really looks great again it's a
rough area but it doesn't look rough
like somehow we made it look good and I
actually got towed off by going inside
that trolley for a photo so you know
this photo it tells a story so yeah
those are all of the photos for location
number four I had so much fun filming
this video I kind of put off filming
this video for a little while but then I
just thought no this is gonna be so much
fun it's kind of like a true challenge
