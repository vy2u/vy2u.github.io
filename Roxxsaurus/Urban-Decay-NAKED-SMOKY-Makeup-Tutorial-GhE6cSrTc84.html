filming at this makeup lug ad for this
eye makeup I've just used the smokey
Naked palette by urban decay I haven't
actually had a chance to play around
with this palette yet so I'm super
excited to be filming this look for you
guys so hope you guys enjoy this layer
don't forget to give the video a thumbs
up and subscribe if you haven't already
and let's just jump straight into the
video so to start off I'm using the
Urban Decay primer potion just to prime
my lid for all the shadow that's going
to go on afterwards and I'm reaching for
the Naked Urban Decay smoky palette I'm
reaching full shade combust I'm applying
that with my zoeva crease brush just as
a light wash all over the lid for a nice
base color and then reaching a full
password with the same brush and I'm
sweeping that through the crease as well
as the outer corner as a light
transition shade
and then I just decided to take a strip
of masking tape and place that on the
outer corner so that we get a nice clean
and sharp edge for the shadow I'm then
taking a dagger on the two three four
luxe smoky shader brush by Zoe Weaver
and I'm just applying that in the outer
corner first to get the most
pigmentation right there and then
whatever is left on the brush I'm just
kind of blending that all over the rest
of the lid I'm then taking the next
shadow along which is black market and
I'm just placing that again in the outer
corner to kind of deepen up the eye
again and just add more dimension to it
I'm then going in with combust once
again just to use that as a transition
shadow to kind of blend out any harsh
edges of the dagger shade next I'm
reaching for the shade 30 and piling
that over dagger just in the center and
inner corner just to lighten up that
shade I'm then reaching for my Naked 2
palette and I'm taking black out on the
brush that comes with the palette and
I'm again just putting that further into
the outer corner to deepen it up even
more I feel like The Naked 2 palette
doesn't actually have a really distinct
and contrasting color in the palette
which is why I decided to reach for the
Naked 2 palette and then going in with
dagger and just pulling that on the
lower lash line to tie the whole look
together next I'll be lining my eye and
creating a cat wing with the line ASA by
Sigma it's actually one of my favorite
eyeliners at the moment as it's quite
matte and really opaque
and then reaching for the Rimmel
exaggerate waterproof eyeliner and I'm
just using that to tightline my eyes I'm
then putting some mascara on my lashes
and I'm using the YSL mascara for this
and lastly I'll just be finishing off
the eye look with some Revlon eyelashes
kind of clean up the under eye area from
any fallout I'm just using the two
shukla by Yves saint-laurent and I'm
blending that out with my foundation
brush from Real Techniques
the highlighter I'm going to be using
today is by sleek and this is the
highlighting palette in solstice I
believe that the one I'm using is called
Equinox for the left I'm just using a
really nice nude lip liner by Rimmel and
this is in shade cappuccino and to
finish the lips off I'm using a liquid
lipstick and this is by the brand key
best lip series and that is the final
look I hope you guys like it so that's
