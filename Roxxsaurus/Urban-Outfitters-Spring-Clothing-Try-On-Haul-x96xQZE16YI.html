and Urban Outfitters try on Paul I
haven't done a clothing haul in so long
so I thought it's about time to do some
fashion related videos on my channel so
I picked out a lot bits of for spring
and summer I'll have all the links to
everything I show you in this video down
in the description so if you guys like
any piece then you can definitely go
ahead and check it out on their website
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up and subscribe if you're not already
and if you would like to follow me on
any of my social media I Twitter
Instagram and snapchat our or rocks or
same way it's about here but without
very let's just jump right into the
video so I've got everything in a
massive pile just down there so I'm just
going to pick out bits that I see in no
particular order so the first thing I
picked up from Urban Outfitters it's
actually wrong way round I'm not
prepared for this video the first thing
I picked up from Urban Outfitters is
this really cute turtleneck actually got
two different top necks this one is like
this ribbed kind of texture and this is
gorgeous
peachy and kind of dusky rose color
which is so on-trend right now and I
just love the feel of this material it's
really really nice and soft and you guys
see me wearing turtlenecks pretty much
like every day of my life and our outfit
has a lot of choice for turtleneck so I
feel like they're a good website to kind
of stock up on your tower necks and this
one is also ripped but it's made from
this slightly different material and it
looks like this
it's light blue and yeah this is what it
looks like I really love these kind of
colors like these past all pinks and
blues because I feel like they're just a
really nice switch up from my like
regular black wardrobe the next thing I
picked up is this like sweats a jumper
thing and this is from the brand bdg and
it's a really nice dusty rose color do
you guys - your recurring theme yet I
don't know I've just been really loving
these really pinky and light shades of
color recently I'm not usually the type
of girl to like pinks
I used to hate the color pink for some
reason but now it's really growing on me
and yes this is just like one of those
jumpers that you can throw on when
you're having a lazy day in and it's
just really like easy stylish and
comfortable so perfect combo so this
next piece is something really really
cute that I feel like a lot of you guys
will love but for me I've never worn
anything like this before so it's quite
out of my comfort zone but I'm willing
give it go and it's this really cute
dungaree star dress it looks like this
again it's a dusty rose color but like I
said I've just been loving this color a
lot and it's got cute little tips on the
side so you can like put your phone in
if you want
I think this paired with the turtleneck
will just look so cute the next thing I
picked up from that website is this
really cute wide brimmed hat
I think hats like this is so cute I kind
of feel like a witch from American
Horror Story coven wearing this hat but
that's totally okay with me yeah it's
just a really really simple thing but I
feel like it can really dress up your
outfit a lot the next thing I got is
this gray ribbed body it goes all the
way down and it's got a really nice car
at the back which is a nice little
addition I like that it's not too low
neck you know what I mean like it's
still pretty wearable and you can just
chuck anything over the top of this um
maybe like a sheer shirt or something
and you're just a really really cute
this perhaps will be more suitable for
the summer but I still picked it up
because I really liked it the next thing
I picked up is this backpack I thought
this was so cute it's really like
minimalistic and it's black and it's got
like gold details which are two of my
favorite things combined it's quite
spacious I just felt like I wanted a
backpack for like the spring and summer
seasons just because if I'm running
about or like going to festivals or like
picnics then I think this is a good
option rather than carrying a head bag
around the next thing is a cardigan and
this is a really nice soft knit cardigan
it's quite thin it's not too long which
is always great it's got that really
slap Chi feel to it which I really like
so I feel like finding this over the top
on like colder spring or summer days
will just be great the next thing I
picked up is this top from violence and
noise it looks like this it's like a
grey kind of slap Qi top it's got this
cross over detailing in the front here
and it's got a little like slit down the
middle which isn't like too revealing I
feel like it's still quite wearable this
is kind of creased I'm gonna have to
iron it so sorry about that guys but
this isn't really nice on the model on
the website so I thought I might as I'll
just try it out and see if it
sees me next thing I picked up is this
little black crop top it's off the
shoulders and it's got like half length
sleeves which i think is really
flattering and the off the short cut is
really feminine and I really like it and
it's quite stretchy as well so I'm
pretty sure this could fit a lot of
different sizes even though it's a size
S the next thing I picked up is this
little crop top which is like stripes
and the stripes are navy and white and
this is again from B D G B D G I
literally killing it when I saw this on
the website I thought what this is a
dungaree top I feel like it might even
work with the dungaree dress that I
showed you earlier but I'm not sure if
the colors will go so I have to try that
out and then also picked up some black
shorts and I've never had black
high-waisted shorts believe it or not
I've always had my denim ones but never
black and I've always wanted some so I
picked these up and these are from the
brand dr. denim jeans makers they look
like this they're just really simple I
feel like they will look really cool
with Doc Martens he's not quite big
though I don't know if they'll fit me
but we'll see um I'm usually quite small
around the butt region but they might
fit me alright I'm not sure next I also
picked up this Calvin Klein tank top
this is a really simple Calvin Klein
design but I think it's quite cute
anyway it is quite secret I'll recommend
wearing a sports bra underneath this
apart from that it's really great and
the material is really soft but I feel
like this is a really cool and casual
stable piece of my wardrobe and then
also picked up one of these Calvin Klein
sports bras a lot of people have been
saying that they're really comfortable
so I wanted to pick one up myself and
try it out I think it's just a really
cute simple design it's a really on
trend at the moment so I gave in to the
hype
hashtag my Calvin's next thing I picked
up is this a leather style jacket and
this is by the brand sparkling fade it's
like a matte black so it's not like a
shiny leather it's a matte leather this
is obviously faux leather and I love the
feel of it it's really nice it's a nice
bit and until now I've got to say I've
never had the perfect black leather
jacket this is probably one of my
favorite things that I picked up from
Urban Outfitters the next thing is this
Urban Outfitters renewal jacket I just
really love how grungy at least I feel
like it'll be great for spring and
summer just to throw over the top of
anything for like the colder days it's
just really really cute again I think
this will look amazing with when Doc
Martens so I picked it up the next thing
I picked up are some shades and these
are what they look like these are so so
nice and they've got like this silver
band around the top which is a nice
little detail and they're like this
creamy white color almost clear which
I've never actually had glasses like
this before what you guys think do they
suit me I really love them they're so
precious we're now coming close to the
end I've got two more items to show you
and they're both shoes in the past I've
realized I don't actually have a lot of
pairs of shoes and it's the same of
trousers and shoes I don't really know
why it seems like I always buy tops but
always forget about the bottoms so I
picked up some chelsea boots from Urban
Outfitters and these are so so gorgeous
these are just the Urban Outfitters own
brand and they are amazing I've been
wearing these like every day these are
so classic and really stylish and
they're really comfortable actually I
feel like you have to break them in
first but once you do they're really
comfortable everywhere needs like every
day and the last day of course it picked
up some converse converse are one of my
favorite shoes to wear around spring and
summer especially someone because
they're just so cute really comfortable
and then look amazing with high-waisted
shorts so that is all for my urban
outfits try on haul I hope you guys
