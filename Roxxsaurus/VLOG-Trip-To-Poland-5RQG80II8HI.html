Poland and I thought I would take you
along on a little like trip with me to
see what I get up to for like the next
three days if you want to see my vlog
from two years ago I'll link it down
below so you can check it out and a lot
of you seem to like that video so I
thought I would film another like follow
me around Poland social video so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see
you very soon so I'm out now and I'm
going to be going to town
my mom and my Nana on the back where
we're going to catch a bus to go to town
and I think I'm gonna go buy some shoes
because I don't have a lot of shoes in
my collection so I thought I might look
for some that we don't really have over
in the UK and yeah just do a bit of like
shopping which I always do want to come
to ponent let's be honest I always do
some shopping so yeah that is all I'll
keep you updated what I'm doing coming
out to film in the shopping center then
I will
I'll catch you as soon as possible so I
just come up the shopping center and now
I'm going to be going to visit some of
my family like cousins and stuff I did a
little bit of shopping which is kind of
naughty but I'll show you guys what I
got when I get back home and oh my
goodness I'm so excited to show you what
I got cause it's such a bargain so yeah
all gone so much wind in my eyes my eyes
are watering but yeah I'm just here
hello everyone I'm back again
and sorry I didn't get to film much
today it was quite a busy day but I
didn't actually get up to to much which
is strange after I went shopping I just
went to my family's house and we just
kind of spent the whole day there we
ordered some pizza we kind of originally
decided to go out for dinner but like I
promised I will show you guys what I
bought I was kind of naughty and I
bought a little bit too much than I
intended to it like I said I was going
to get some shoes and I did actually get
some shoes the only thing is I didn't
stop that so I got these lovely pair of
shoes which looks like this they look
really black on camera but they're
actually like a painted navy color and I
am just in love with that and these are
by a brand called
La Strada and I got these from TK Maxx
so you guys know I used to work at TK
Maxx I just thought I might as well just
pop in just to see what it's like in
Poland because I've never been to TK
Maxx in Poland and I managed to find
these little beauties so yeah I really
really liked them and also went to a
shop called Douglas and this is the
little bag which is super cute the first
thing I picked up is an EOS bomb this is
my first ever u.s. bomb I've never tried
these before haven't even opened it yet
but this is in the blueberry flavor I've
never seen us bombs in England anywhere
so I thought I might as well grab one
mmm it tastes really good so yeah that's
that I paid like 25 s water for this
which is like the Polish currency which
turns out it's like 5 pounds or
something so that was super cheap the
next purchase was definitely my naughty
purchase and that is because I got a
Chanel lipstick this is my first ever
Chanel lipstick this is the Coco shine
hydrating color lip shine and this isn't
shade 96 aura the only reason why I
bought this is because it's such a
bargain I only paid the equivalent of 18
pounds for this and in England the
retail price for this I think is like 37
pounds I believe
hi guys it's day 2 and I am now going
out to get my lashes done I don't know
if I mentioned this last night but I'm
basically gonna get my lash extensions
done I've now got them done before so
this is quite a scary thing but I'll
take you guys along with me if I can and
I'll show you like the before and after
of the effect and how it worked
hi everyone so it's a lot later now and
I'm currently in a toilet of a cinema
room and it's actually really cooling it
look at that so soon as the toilet that
is but anyway I am at the cinema
watching a movie and the movie I'm
watching is called at the boy I watched
the trailer for an image quite good so
I'm going to watching that with my mom
and my cousin I got my lashes done and I
might also film like a lash extension
video showing you like maybe talking
about like my experience and stuff like
that if you guys would like to see that
then let me know down in the comments
but yeah I thought from now I'm just
gonna go watch the movie and then I'll
head back home so I probably won't film
so I'll just catch you guys tomorrow
hello everyone so it's day 3 and I just
got up I haven't brushed my hair I did
my makeup though and it's so weird not
to wear eyeliner because in my lashes I
can't wear any eye makeup until they
like all fall out practically I might
still try and do like a winged liner at
some time because you know me I love my
winged liner but I'm going to try and
refrain from using any eye makeup I
might talk about my experience a little
bit here it took me about an hour it
took two hours for my mom's luscious to
get done I don't know why maybe it's
because she kept opening her eyes which
you're not allowed to do but I was like
laying there still for like an hour and
she did my really quickly so it was good
but it was so annoying because my eyes
get really itchy and I could feel like
one of the lashes like poking in because
they have to tape your bottom lashes
down
they do your top one so they don't get
like mixed up and my bottom lashes were
itching so bad and I couldn't scratch it
I was literally like laying there like
oh my god for like an hour
I couldn't eat what I is it was the most
frustrating experience of ever but apart
from that it was pretty good I probably
would get it done again and the only
thing that was bad was obviously the
itching and I couldn't scratch it but
that was just that was just obnoxious
there was no pain or anything and I'm
really happy with how they look I wanted
to go for something a little bit more
natural than my mum my mum got 3d lashes
and I got to deal ashes I think that
means getting two lashes attached to one
lash and Mowen got three lashes attached
to one lash so my look a little bit more
natural but anyway I'll catch you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
