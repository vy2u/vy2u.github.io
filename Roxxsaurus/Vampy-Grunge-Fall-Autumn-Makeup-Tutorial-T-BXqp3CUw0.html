you how to recreate this grunge look I'm
so excited to start making grunge makeup
videos for the fall and autumn it's my
favorite season of the year because
Halloween so yeah today I'm going to be
showing how to recreate this dark grungy
sort of inspired look so actually before
I start this tutorial I have a really
really useful website that I recently
got to know about the websites good
glambot and basically what they do is
they sell a pre-owned makeup and it
could be like any brands of so many
brands there's mark this Chanel there's
like all of these designer brands of
makeup and they sell it for much less so
it's a really useful website if you want
to try things out but maybe they're not
in your budget and there's a lot of
things in spells as well and it's
literally a bargain I'm telling you guys
so I couldn't I want to show you guys of
what they sent me they sent me five
things and the first one is this Bobby
Brown foundation in a stick format and I
actually really love this I've had one
of these before and everything that I
show you has been pre-owned but they do
sterilize their and make your hygiena
for people to buy so basically whoever
this little foundation stick what they
would have done is cut off the top where
someone has been using it and then like
sterilized all around it so you don't
have to worry about someone else using
yet the next thing they sent me is the
Bobbi Brown concealer and it looks like
this and again this was very nicely
packaged it had a little safety seal on
it and before I used it in this tutorial
it was literally like brand new there
wasn't any fingerprints in it or
anything so I really recommend to check
out their website the last three things
I picked I brought you from Mac and I'm
slightly again obsessed with MAC
lipsticks I'm telling you so the first
one is Ruby woo
it's the lip shade that I'm wearing
right now I am in love with this it's a
matte red and it's literally perfect I
don't know how I've been living without
it before and this next one is the
little bit of a different Macklin
I've never had one of these before and
this is the mineralized rich dreaminess
lipstick and it's this really nice like
pinky sort of nude shade and it's
gorgeous again for the lipsticks and the
lipsticks have been shaved off for at
the top where someone's been using it
and sterilized all around completely so
it's safe to use for anyone and the last
thing I got is this highlighter by Mac I
don't know it's called khru or highlight
powder just looks like this I think it's
a really really cute so now you actually
have a little bit discount code for you
guys it will be a link down below you
get 30% off when you sign up on their
website but this only works for 72 hours
after I've posted this video so make
sure you're quick to go over and check
it out so definitely do check it out as
soon as you can because there is a
limited number of each product so once
it's gone it's gone like you can't you
can't get it again so anyway I will be
using some of those products that I just
showed you in this makeup look so let's
just jump straight into the tutorial so
first things first I'm gonna focus on
the skin and to prime it a little bit
I'm going to be using this hocus-pocus
soap &amp;amp; Glory illuminator this just gives
the skin a nice and glow and a jus
effect it's gonna pop that where I want
to highlight my features and it's all
better so I'm gonna put them on the
cheekbone a little bit on the bridge of
my nose
and little bit on the forehead oh by the
way I already do have a bit of mascara
on from earlier and I just couldn't move
on to take it off so I hope you guys
don't mind it now for foundation I'm
gonna be using the Bobbi Brown
let's stick that I got from glam pop
it's pretty true to my skin color so I'm
literally gonna take it right from the
packaging and just dab it underneath my
eyes and anywhere where I may have a bit
of redness and then I'm going in with my
Real Techniques foundation brush it's a
really small one and I'm just gonna
blend all of that out nicely to the skin
I'm also gonna take some of the product
over my eye because I do tend to get
reminisce of my eyelids and little babes
here and there so I'm just going to prep
that nicely for the eyeshadow to come
next I'm going to go in with the Bobbi
Brown that concealer to just to brighten
up the area underneath my eyes and over
my eyelids birth up to apply I'm just
using this little precision brush by
Real Techniques I'm just covering any
darkness underneath my area and your
little veins I tend to get a lot of
darkness underneath my eyes because my
skin is a Pollock bone and it really
really bugs me so I need a lot of
coverage under that not to set the
foundation I'm going to using second
Glory's one heck of a lot happier and
this is a translucent powder which looks
like this and I'm using my Real
Techniques contour brush to apply it I
this is a contour brush but I really
like it for powder now for brows I'm
gonna be using my soap &amp;amp; Glory brow
archery pencil and I'm gonna be using
the curly side first just to clip
through my eyebrows and get them in the
place I want them to me and then I'm
gonna meeting the pencil side just to
fill in any sparse areas of my eyebrows
I don't get quite as fast towards the
front I'm not too sure why but that's
why I have to fill them in a little bit
moving on to bronzer I'm gonna be using
a bronzer by the bomb called Bahama Mama
and I'm gonna be placing that just
underneath my cheek bone just to define
it a little bit more and for this I'm
using the contour brush by Real
Techniques now for slight blush I'm
gonna be using this sleek blush this is
in shade flush 9:35 and it's a gorgeous
like burgundy color it's great for
autumn and I think this will suit the
red themed sort of look very well I'm
trying to really just focus that on the
cheekbone so I'm just brushing it up and
down just a little bit above where we
contoured and for this tutorial I'm
going to be using the nude tude palette
by the balm this has a really nice
combination of shimmery and matte shades
but today I'm going to be
these match shades that are on this side
of the pallet so first things first I'm
going to be using a saw tree which is
this one here and it's a really nice
matte Cortona Brown so I'm just popping
that on a fluffy brush by Bobbi Brown
and I'm washing that all over the lid
try and keep her closest to the lash
line and then sort of blend it out and
fade it out words and by laying this
soft color all over the lid were just
sort of building a foundation for a
whole look you can also take you
underneath your lash line as well and
because this is a grunt ripped look
we're actually going to blend the lower
shadow
much lower than you usually would on an
everyday basis next I'm reaching before
this darker Brown shadow which is this
one here it's cool to sleep and I'm just
going to music a smaller fluffy brush to
apply it and again we're trying to focus
and most of it near the lash line and
then gradually we're going to build it
up and blend it outwards into the other
transition color
what was it going to take that sink
shadow and drag out on the lower
lashline so now I'm gonna be taking
another shade called what is it called
that one here it's called sexy Emily and
it's a really nice burgundy shadow and
that's what's gonna add that pop of
color to this look and we're gonna blend
that into the crease very very subtly so
this is a very easy and nice way to pull
off a red eyeshadow you don't have to
commit to putting it all over the lid or
anything but you do get that pop of
color without having the look of
irritated eyes so up here it looks a
little bit harsh in the transition color
isn't as soft as I'd like it to be so
I'm just going back in over it and then
I'm returning back to my red and just
placing that in to the crease once again
this is all about taking your time and
just building up on that color just
returning back to you every shadow and
making sure that everything is as
pigmented as you want it see what the
hell I'll even go back to sleep which
was the dark brown shadow and I'm gonna
again go over the lash line sort of
shade to make sure it's darkened then
I'm taking my little pencil brush again
and I'm picking up sleep which is the
dark brown color and I'm just going over
my bottom lash line I'm also pulling in
that color into my inner corner and sort
of using that as a liner just to darken
up the eye a lot more then I'm going
back in with my trusty smaller fluffy
brush and I'm just blending all that out
making sure it's all nice
and that the gradient is as soft as
possible now lastly I'm going to be
going in with the black shadow from this
palette and this is called Sirius and
I'm just taking my small fluffy brush
once again and with this we are really
really going to focus that in the lash
lines we're gonna really concentrate
this near the lashes as close as
possible you're just literally going to
brush it through the lashes to get that
darkest shade as close to the lash line
as possible and then with a clean bigger
fluffy brush I'm just blending that
black into the brown so you can leave
this look like this but because I like
my eyes to look a little bit more red
around I'm gonna add a little bit more
of that sexy shadow and placing that in
the crease just to intensify the redness
a little bit but you don't have to do
this
and then I'm also dragging that red very
very slightly underneath my lower lash
line so now you can actually do whatever
you like you could add a winged liner if
you like you could add a Kohl liner all
around the island smudge it out but I'm
actually gonna leave it how it is and
I'm gonna skip straight to your mascara
and for mascara I'm gonna be using this
what's your type mascara by the balm so
now for the lips I'm gonna be going in
with Mac Ruby whoo
so this is what it looks like with the
lip and I really really like this but I
am gonna go in with a deeper red to just
darken up the corners of my mouth and
make my lips look more 3d and in order
to do that I'm going to be using this
lipstick by collection and this is from
the Gothic and ghulam collection and
it's in shade revenge free so I'm just
taking a little lip brush and popping
that color in the corners of my mouth so
this is the final look I hope you guys
like it and I hope you guys recreate it
for the fall and autumn if you do decide
to recreate it definitely tag me on
Instagram or Twitter and I would love to
see your recreations so I hope you guys
enjoyed this makeup tutorial and I'll
