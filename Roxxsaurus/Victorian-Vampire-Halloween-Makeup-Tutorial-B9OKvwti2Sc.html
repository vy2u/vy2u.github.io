and a Beautyblender sponge to apply the
white very thinly over my face to make
it appear as natural as possible once
the lace is done I'm going to jump into
contouring and what I'm gonna use for
contouring is the sleek palette this is
in all natural 6:01 and the gray from
this is going to be perfect because it's
maps so I'm just going to use that to
contour my face and make it much more
Hollow
I'm just really dead looking I'm going
to use a dome brush to contour my cheeks
and give them a much more sunken in look
next I'm going to use a small fluffy
brush to contour my nose I'm just going
to make it look much more slender and
pointy to just sort of tie in with the
whole vampire risk look
now I'm going to go into the eye sockets
with the same eyeshadow and sort of
contour eat inner part of the socket to
make it look much more sunken in and add
more depth I'm still not quite satisfied
with the contour so I'm going to mix the
gray and black eyeshadow and subtly sort
of go into the contour of my cheeks
again
now the fun part we're going to move on
to the eyes I'm going to be using a
palette that I got from a waist up and
has got a lot of a variety of colors
it's got some nice sort of like plum
colors and it's just going to be perfect
for this look because we want to look
really sort of dead and drained so we're
going to really create like a swollen
eye look with plum colors and Browns and
stuff like that so I'm going to using
this palette and I'll link it down below
if you guys want to check it out but use
any eyeshadows that you have available
so first I'm going to take this sort of
color which is like a brown slash plum
color it's got a red undertone to it so
it's going to be perfect and I will load
that up on a big fluffy brush and just
sort of sweep it all over the lid around
the eye
once that's done I'm going to return
back to my sleek palette and I'm going
to use this dark plum shadow which is
this one to depth on my eye socket and
to sort of outline the crease so I'm
just going to go a little bit above my
crease to definer now leave it a little
bit dramatic than I usually would
because this is a vampire look obviously
so I'm not going to blend it out as much
as you normally would
next I'm going to take the brown from
the same palette which is a matte dark
brown and using the same brush I'm going
to sweep that underneath my lower lash
line and sort of pull it down you more
than usually word because you want to
look really dead and tired and almost
like you've got under-eye circles
a letdown and so blend it out into the
white
next I'm going to take a black eyeliner
this is by natural collection I'm going
to use this to line my tight line and
also a little bit on the outer edge of
my lower lash line I'm also going to
pull that eyeliner into the inner corner
little bit to give the eyes a little bit
more of a animalistic look now using my
Beauty UK eyebrow kit and an angle brush
I'm going to go into the eyebrows and
sort of make them a little bit more
angular to just make them look a little
bit more evil and villain like as for
the lips you will not look really
thirsty like you haven't drunk blood for
like years and years so I'm going to use
some plum and black eye shadows to put
over my mouth and the ones I'm using is
from the sleek palette once more and I'm
using a small fluffy brush to apply them
onto like the inner part of my lip I'm
now going to go in with a thin brush and
a plum shadow from the same sleek
palette to just create little veins on
the underneath of my eyes this is sort
of inspired by The Vampire Diaries you
know like when they turn into the
vampire they started getting veins
underneath their eyes so that's what I'm
gonna try and recreate
now to solve turn this down a little bit
I'm going to go in with some face powder
and I'm using the same app powder just
to sort of fade it out and make it look
more underneath the skin
this last step is optional but I'm going
to go in with some mascara over the
lashes to add a little bit more volume
to them to finish off this whole look
I'm going to go in with some red lip
liner into the eyes to make them look a
little bit more bloodshot
so that is all for my vampire Halloween
makeup I hope you guys enjoyed this if
you do recreate it please tag me on
instagram my instagram will be linked
below or at the end of the video if you
liked this video give a big thumbs up
and look at my hands they look really
really bad um yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll see you when
x1 by one day in the park I had quite a
surprise I met a girl who had many eyes
she was really quite pretty and also
quite shocking and I noticed she had a
mouth so we ended up talking we talked
about flowers and her poetry classes and
the problems she'd have if she had a
walk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
