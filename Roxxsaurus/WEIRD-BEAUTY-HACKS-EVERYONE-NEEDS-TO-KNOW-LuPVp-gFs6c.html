channel I hope you guys are all well
today I have another video a pity of you
guys so some of these hacks are one that
I thought myself and some of them are
just ones that I found on the internet
and let me tell you I watch a lot of
these videos just because they're so
entertaining and fun to watch and I have
to say some of these hats that I'm about
to show you I've never seen anyone only
should do before so hopefully they'll be
at least a few that you guys haven't
seen if you enjoyed this type of video
then definitely be sure to leave me a
thumbs up so I know and subscribe to
this channel as well as my blog channel
and with that birdie like she showed
right into the video
okay so the first one is kind of a weird
one I don't know if it will be practical
in like everyday life but if you ever
have a clear lip gloss you can actually
double this as a highlight the hell of
this and I thought it would be quite
cool maybe I don't know of course if you
have a very sticky formula I don't know
if this would work but this one I have
here isn't that sticky at all so we want
to do is take your clear lip gloss and
just pop it over your cheek bone Pat it
in a little bit and then set it with
your powder so that it doesn't move
throughout the day I think this works
pretty well I mean it may look a little
bit greasy because I did pack on a lot
just so that you could see in the camera
but if you have like just a tiny bit and
then really said it with your powder and
I think you could get away with it and
if you didn't want to use anything as
sticky as a clear lip gloss you could
always take a moisturizer or cream like
Nivea and pop over a thick layer on your
cheek for a nice glow as well the next
tag is using a coconut oil as a
mouthwash coconut is great for
everything is great for your hair it's
great for removing makeup but it's also
really great few mouths because coconut
can actually wave your teeth as well as
disinfect any bacteria in your mouth
the next hack is for cleaning at your
makeup brushes I always struggle with
finding the right product that is there
to clean my brushes but isn't really
expensive and actually a great hat for
cleaning brushes is using a regular
cleanser and the one I use for this is
the body shop chamomile or chamomile I
don't know how to pronounce it very well
it's the sumptuous cleansing butter
basically what I do is I put my brush a
little bit and then I swish it around in
the little pot and it cleans my brushes
really really well the next time it is
for getting rid of your smile lines I
don't know about you guys but sometimes
I get creases in my foundation from when
I smile too much and I don't really like
how it looks because it makes my face
look much more edge than it really is so
a great way to combat this frustrating
smile lines is to actually use an
eyeshadow primer and because we get so
much creasing in our eyes especially
when we wear eye shadow this L product
is a Holy Grail because it's so heavy
duty that it prevents any kind of makeup
creasing and we'll do the exact same
thing for your smile line probably
better than a face primer would this
next tag is a little bit weird it's
probably not necessary but I thought it
was quite cool so I'm going to include
it in the video anyway and it's
basically using cocoa powder as a
bronzer now I know a lot of you are
going to say why don't you just get a
bronzer they're not that expensive in
the drugstore but to be fair this is
natural and I feel like it works just as
well and I feel like if you are out of
your actual bronzer and you don't want
to run to the shops you can't just go to
the kitchen and just grab your cocoa
powder and you are ready to go the next
tag is using an olive oil to clean it
your Beauty Blender I find it so hard to
clean Beauty blenders they are amazing
to apply makeup with but I never use
them very often because I just can't do
want to clean them so all you wanna do
is take your Beauty Blender and just dip
it in some water as you usually would to
apply your makeup and then you just want
to pour some olive oil over it and just
gently rub away all the dirt and then
rinse it off and your view blender
should be nice and clean the next time
is quite a common one its wetting your
brush before you apply your eyeshadow
and I did this quite a lot to get the
most pigmentation out of it but I've
never actually tried to doing it on my
eyebrows only recently I started wetting
my brush with some setting spray just
before I apply my powder to my brows and
when you wet your brush the formula of
the powder changes quite a lot and from
a powder this can turn into more of a
gel consistency and in turn it will make
your product glide on much more smoothly
and you can get Anastasia Beverly brows
pomade whatever it's called kind of
effect the next line pug is using an
avocado oil as a makeup remover if you
are out of you makeup remover but you do
have never Carter laying around in your
kitchen
just cut the sofa and swipe the oil from
this and actually use it as a maker
remover the next height is putting up
your hair without any hair tight I've
been there I want to put my hair up but
I didn't have a hair type on any of my
wrists and I was like oh my god if you
have long hair you will know my pain
sometimes my hair just gets all annoying
when it's in my face but that actually
is a way to put your hair up without any
hai grips or any hair ties so you want
to do is gather your hair into a regular
ponytail and twist it into a tight
button once you have formed the bond a
pull a section of hair out just I am
lead from the bun and then pull it back
over the bun this strand of hair will
act almost as a hair tie for you and I
will keep your hair up nice and securely
and the last beauty hike is using a
lemon to make your time stick to your
skin much better how do you do you think
tab and find that some of the talent
doesn't stick to your skin in some areas
as much as others if you actually take
some lemon juice and rub that over any
areas where the tan isn't really
clinging and then apply the Tong over
the top you'll find that a town that
develops much walking minted in that
area afterwards
