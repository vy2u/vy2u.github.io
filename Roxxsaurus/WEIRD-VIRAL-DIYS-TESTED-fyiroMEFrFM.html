I hope you guys are having an awesome
day so far so today as you can tell from
the title I'm going to be doing a
slightly different video than I usually
do on this channel and I'm actually
going to be testing out viral DIY I have
literally seen these DIYs like all over
the place and I'm sure you guys have too
so I just thought let's test them out
and do the pre vibe so you guys don't
have to if you can't be bothered you
guys enjoyed this video and like DIY
stuff make sure you give this video a
thumbs up so I know to do more like this
in the future and if you guys are new
here and you haven't subscribed yet and
make sure you do the button is just down
below it's that big my button colors
subscribe come enjoy the dinosaur family
yes I also have a vlogging channel a
little bit so pro right here make sure
you guys subscribe to my baby blogging
channel too so we can hang out every
single day but without go rambling I
want to see if these DIYs actually work
so let's get into the video okay so for
the finest DIYs we're going to be
creating and the famous like watercolor
mugs with nail polish now I've never
really probably tried this I don't think
so the first thing I need are two white
mugs like this you could have them any
shape that you like but I just got lead
one but quite cheap from Tesco the next
thing you're gonna need is some hot
water which I'm going to put in this
little container that I have here and
then the next thing you're going to need
awesome but colored nail polishes you
can achieve any no closures of your life
so I've got a blue one and then like a
pinky one and then also a newt one so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to open up these nail polishes and
literally just and drip them in there
like some kind of a waste of nail polish
but if this work I think it's gonna look
really cool
hey you know the pattern slash design is
finished I'm going to take my mug and
just machine dip the bottom half into
the design I'm kind of scared to ruin
one bug but first when you're like okay
here we go okay Oh 15 anything automatic
oh my god that smells so bad why you
hanging off of the mark whatever to do I
feel like this hasn't really worked like
what I did wrong I don't think I did
anything wrong because they especially
put hole watering put now pushes in and
then I get the bug in and everyone else
does on the internet and it just came
out pretty like not nice look at you see
your mechanism what it turns out like I
just don't know what I've done wrong I
don't think I've done anything wrong I
guess it might be the power position
like youth maybe these ones have don't
really work so well for this technique
okay I'm gonna give this a same shot and
I'm going to use the blue nail polish
now so again I'm just going to drip this
in like so nothing coming out ten hours
later not worth 100 much top and working
why did this happen don't ruin my top
now okay well that blue nail polish
clearly does not work and I've just
ruined my top so that's just great so
instead under than a try this other nail
polishes also pink only I would do that
literally I'm just like the clumsiest
person ever okay round two I'm painting
my second mug and I'm going to dip it in
the nail polish and see if it does
anything I already over does way I think
this one was a little bit better it's
still looking quite gloopy but I feel
like that might go away once it's dry
feel like the novel is that I used my
video a little bit too heavy which is
why it kind of contr in some areas but
overall I think it looks pretty fault
this is definitely like how better than
my first attempt though and he said that
they hated the next DIY is slime
I feel like slime has become such a
viral thing on YouTube especially and I
have never actually tried it like I
always think oh my god was everyone do
slime video I don't really get the hype
about it
but maybe I was just being like a slime
bridge and I just didn't know how fun it
was so I guess today is the day that we
find out what the hype about slime is so
to make the slime I'm going to need a
glass of water which is
hot water so I'm going to add this into
my measuring jug now our starts to shoot
some borax which is what everyone seems
to be using for slime which we actually
can't get here in the UK I'm going to be
using this little bad boy and this is
the other cleaning gel and I've got this
from Aldi so for those of you out there
who live in the UK this is a great
substitute for borax so leave it so
we're going to do is I'm going to take
and it will t spin like this
and I'm going to add two teaspoons of
this into my hot water okay so I'm going
to mix this up and then I'm just going
to leave this on the side to be because
we're going to focus on the actual slime
mixture so if you create your slime
mixture the first thing you're going to
need is some PVA glue a lot of people
from the marriages Elmer's glue bottles
we have this in the UK so I'm just going
to add a goal up of this a pioneer to
use half of Cobo this roughly looks like
hover customi so we're all good now the
next ingredient is actually shaving a
foam that I listed is going to squirt
some of this into the mixture and this
is going to give it that fluffy effect
and anything you need to add is some
hand soap transition is going to pour a
little bit of my hand slips into the
mixture half-life is the bridge to add
the stretchiness to your slide the next
ingredient is actually corn flour or
corn starch that I have got this from
Tesco again and I'm going to add a
tablespoon of this into the mixture so
now that all is done we can mix the
whole thing together and always on this
kind of looks like whipped cream like
the shaving fibers which you look like
whipped cream so I'm going to mix all
that together until it pretty much looks
like marshmallow fluff a little bit
mixed I'm going to add some food
coloring so the first color that I'm
going to do is right and look you're
going to add like half a teaspoon of
this into the mixture and cook to God it
turns out okay oh my god I look so
pretty I don't know why but the color is
just going so like grey it doesn't even
look nice yeah I've literally poured the
whole blue into this and I swear if this
not to happen - I don't know my music
okay so I've mixed up the mixture and
this is what it looks like
it actually looks gray I don't know why
why is the color not vibrant like I just
wanted like a baby blue or a baby pink
but it just don't seem to work out so
now that I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my mixture that we did previously
like the borax splash water one is going
to add a few teaspoons of this into the
mixture
and this is what's the best of reaction
with the chemicals in that cleaning
detergent and this shouldn't start
forming it into the slime okay still
quite water interesting we're going to
add more of the borax solution if it
doesn't like I will it should be so
disappointed because I followed all of
the instructions I used all the exact
ingredients in people recipes that work
for them I think about the cursed guides
before this need is actually loving that
cornstarch to thicken it up so I'm going
to try and do that is becoming a little
bit more gloopy hello edges in dry paint
so believe me why does it say Walter he
is so not cool how do people make this
fun so perfect okay I totally regret
this is why I put it in my hand I think
this is definitely a sensitive
necessarily I am so excited to do is
blown up like especially on tumblr and
it's the glow-in-the-dark colorful jar
I'm sure you guys have seen at these
pictures on the internet before yeah why
is it so affordable to do because you
probably already have a jar laying
around and then all you need to do is
buy it be glow-in-the-dark paint which I
just got from Hobby craft I personally
think that this will work but it's just
a matter of how well because the picture
in the original picture this DIY looks
so so cool they're going to see how the
glows about paper glow and that much but
I guess we'll see when this DIY alone
evening glow in the dark paint but I
kind of feel like in the original DIY
then use and neon stick like they broke
a neon stick apart and use the liquid
from inside I kind of didn't want to do
that
I know that the inside of the neon thick
and actually quite toxic under the
amazing it some glow-in-the-dark a just
to be safe okay so this is a finished
jar I think it turned out pretty cool as
I said to myself I'm just going to leave
this out in the Sun for about twenty
minutes and then I'm going to put it to
the test I'm going to go into the dark
and see if it's actually work and this
is the finished at DIY glow-in-the-dark
jar I honestly love how it turned out
I'm super impressed however I do feel
like it didn't go for as long as I
expected it to but all in all I still
really like how the DIY turned out now
the film is very last you know why what
you're going to need is a canvas and
some crayons I am probably most excited
to DIY because this one is huge like I
think so many people do this I'm sure
you know Laura you know what I'm going
to be doing but I'm just going to taking
these crayons sticking onto the canvas
it was some hot glue and then I'm just
going to be melting the wax off of the
candles and it should create like a
really cool pattern onto the canvas so
the most tedious and boring part of this
DIY is probably the fact that you have
to remove all of the paper packaging off
of the crayons so throughout that I'll
see you guys in ten years when I'm done
with it and here's a little bit later
now and I'll finally finish unwrapping
all of the crayons this is the aftermath
and I'm now ready to ha glue them all
together so I'm just going to remove
them off of the canvas kalisch is going
to hold leave the whole canvas and stick
them on okay so here I have my glued-on
crammed onto the canvas okay go ahead
Riya I'm going to mount these now so
here it goes
okay guys I think it's safe to say this
is definitely one and it dries so quick
this looks absolutely amazing like I'm
obsessed with how wellness apply I
really don't know why I've never tried
this earlier like if you guys ever want
to do like a project or anything I want
a hundred percent recommend to do this
because it's not that hard to do it's
really cheap and affordable to make but
it's honestly such a fun little project
so guys that is the end of the video and
I am literally so impressed with some of
these DIYs like this one is definitely
by far my absolute favorite I have so
much fun making it it's so satisfying
for look at the colors as they're like
well blending together when you melt
them though one DIY that did not work is
of course the slide and I kind of really
don't want to talk about it because it's
just so embarrassing that I couldn't get
it to work like I just don't understand
why it didn't work if any of you out
there are like Pro slime making people
let me know down below what I did wrong
if I didn't do anything wrong maybe you
can tell me how to successfully make
slime because I definitely need help if
