channel I hope you guys are doing super
well but so I really hope you guys had
an amazing Christmas this year I had a
great time so I went to Twitter and I
asked you guys where you would prefer to
see this video on here or on my second
channel rocks auras blogs and most of
you said you'd like to see this on my
main channel so here I am so today I
thought I would show you guys that what
I got for Christmas I've been seeing
this video on YouTube already which is
insane like everyone is so speedy on
this and a little disclaimer as every
tubers pears in the beginning of their
video this video is not to brag or
anything like that I just thought it
would be fun for you guys to see what I
got for Christmas and that way I can
also find out what you guys got for
Christmas so let me know down below what
you guys received for Christmas this
year I'm gonna have such a good time
reading through all of your comments
because I'm really nosy and I love
knowing what people get for Christmas if
you guys wanna see what I got for
Christmas then just keep on watching ok
so I'm gonna start off with what I got
from my boyfriend Matt first thing I got
this year from my boyfriend is something
that actually asked for because I've
been seeing this around on Instagram and
Twitter and like loads of social medias
so it's this really nice mermaid blanket
umm how amazing is this like whoever
invented this is a genius like I've
always wanted to be a mermaid since I
was little and now I get the opportunity
to be one with this blanket it's such a
nice color it's like this really nice
girly pink color and it's so warm and
like cozy and I love it so much and I
think he got me is this Victoria's
Secret fragrance mist and this is called
of pure seduction
I really have one of these but it's like
my favorite scent from Victoria Secret
so there's I just hit myself in the pain
so it's like my favorite scent from
Victoria's Secret so there's never
enough and also got me this little
stocking filler that's the love hearts
at tea light candles you probably
already know that I love candles so I'm
really happy about this and I'm pretty
sure they're gonna smell like the love
heart sweet which is amazing
but I think that might got me for Chris
is a huge box which I'm about to show
you it's probably going to wipe me out
from the frame of this camera but it's
this huge box and it's basically a home
massager so it's like a little chair and
the other chain it gives you like a
really nice back massage I've been
having back problems recently because of
the way I sit when I edit my videos so
this is a really nice thoughtful gift
that's really gonna help me out with my
back because I'm getting old I'm like
only 20 but I feel like I'm ready to
becoming a grandma and the last thing I
got from Matt is a main present that I
honestly have been wanting for the
longest time and I never thought that I
would actually own one and that is a YSL
handbag
you guys I I have no words
this year I've been telling bad that I
kind of need like a small handbag
because I only have big handbags and I
don't actually have many designer
handbags or anything like that I'm not
really like a designer junkie or
anything but I really loved this one and
you guys won't know why because it's
literally beautiful look how gorgeous
that is I just love it so much I'm gonna
wear it like forever every single day
I'm gonna wear it and I'm literally
gonna treat it like my baby it's just
like the perfect size to fit in like
your phone your keys your camera card
and you're good to go like just the
essentials cuz I hate having to carry
like a whole bag that's like huge and
especially when I get to like London or
like two events I like to have something
that's a little bit smaller and now I
have this gorgeous bag that I can just
wear on those occasions earnest is a
present that I got from a Sharon and
Luca if you guys watch my blogs you know
who they are but if you don't they're
basically from that side of the family
sherry and his mad sister and Luca is
her boyfriend and so they got me this
really nice epic blog planner which is
like a one-year editorial planner for
bloggers slash youtubers you can kind of
make it whatever you want it to be it's
very versatile but it's suited to like
social media and just things like that
so this is going to be super helpful for
me because I really like to be organized
but I've never had like a planner
designed specifically for blogging so
this is amazing I don't even know
that this existed really definitely
going to make a lot of use out of this
the next ones I'm going to show you guys
are ones that I received from my parents
and my mum and dad had got me a pair of
nice Jamie jeans from Topshop you
honestly can't go wrong with these jeans
I love Topshop jeans they're like my
favorite so I'm really happy that I got
another pair also got this really nice a
grey do they set from a hotel 21 from my
parents this is super king-size which is
quite hard to get hold of like really
nice bed sheets so I'm really happy that
it got me a pair so this is the second
thing that they got us a very practical
present next up is a perfume so this I
received from my parents as well it's
the Chloe or de Parfum and oh my
goodness how classy does it look when it
smells divine it's not really the type
of pattern that I pick up for myself but
the fact that they got it for me is so
nice because I just didn't really have
the chance to pick it up for myself but
I smell so good it smell so fresh and
like sweet it's look like the perfect
everyday kind of power for you so the
next thing that my parents got me is
something that my mom kind of picked up
on I don't know how could I do I think I
told her that I wanted a small bag I
think I only told Matt but she also got
me a small bag because she's a mom so
she just knows that I need one um so she
got me this one from Vivienne Westwood
if you guys have been around here for a
while you'll know that I'm obsessed with
Vivienne Westwood's like Vivienne
Westwood is so amazing I just love like
the aesthetic of the products in
Westwood stuff is also like quite
simplistic which I love it's just like
it just presents itself really nicely
and the orb is like a classic this is
another handbag that I can kind of
switch between is also the same similar
kind of size and got a really long strap
which is nice now I have two small bags
to choose from which is amazing the next
thing that I got from my parents is an
eye cream and this one is the eye
contour gold gel by line Paris I'm
really excited to try this out the
bottle is so nice then the next thing
our parents got me I can't even believe
that they've got me there so basically
I've been wanting this item for around
six months and I've completely forgot
that I ever even wanted this and so I
open my Christmas
and I see this saline bag and I'm just
like what the heck and then I open it up
and it's a gorgeous pair of sunglasses
I've literally been lusting over for the
past like six months look how pretty
they are like oh my god I just I always
wanted these always wanted these
sunglasses but I could just never
justify spending a lot of money on
sunglasses I'm just so so happy and I'm
so grateful that they got me these
looking so stylish right now especially
with my Santa hat and these glasses but
honestly I just love the size of these
they make me look like a bug but I love
it I love every second of it now the
next we better are things that I
received from Matt's mom so the first
thing that she got me and Matt is this
new vegan cookbook so if you guys don't
know I'm actually vegetarian my is also
vegetarian but sometimes he's vegan on
some days of the week so this is a
really nice helpful book for us because
we've just kind of been stuck in like a
cycle of cooking the same things all the
time so this is going to be really nice
to have like a look at the inspiration
you also got us some like kitchen
utensil bits because obviously we've
just moved into our house and all that
long ago so we kind of don't have
everything that we need just yet um so
she got us some really nice copper bits
because she knows I'm obsessed with
copper so this is like a little bottle
opener I love playing with these things
and then she also got us a pizza cutter
obviously copper as well she also got a
set of these at copper and silver and
hardware like spoons for cooking we
actually don't have a set of these yet
so I'm really happy that we got those
and then the last thing that she got us
is this burger making kit so you can
like put your own ingredients in there
you can put like vegetables or meat if
you eat me or whatever and you can just
like make your own little burger filler
out of it I'm determined to recreate the
veggie burger from Nando's because if
you guys are done watching my blog you
all know that me and Matt are obsessed
with Nando's and we really want to
recreate the veggie burger so this thing
here is making it that one step closer
so assemble it
presents that I received from my friend
Alex so the first thing that she got me
is this little candle from the white
company and this is the limited edition
white rose this smells divine
I think everyone that knows me will know
that I love candles so this is a great
little gift thank you so much Alex and
then she also got me this little bass
set which is a Christmas cookie body
scrub and the vanilla body butter I'm so
excited to try this and then she also
got me some socks which are really nice
and fluffy and also some chocolate but I
can't show you those because they're
kind of like already in my belly lastly
I've got some gifts I received from
Matt's dad so the first thing that you
got is this really nice kitchen
spice rack which I wanted for ages like
I just love how it looks and me and Matt
love cooking and love spices
so this is a really nice thoughtful gift
so thank you so much and then lastly
Matt's dad also got us it's really nice
and blankie which is like gray on one
side and it's like really fluffy and
cozy on the other and this is actually
king-size you can't see how big it is
but it's like huge like there's just so
much of this blanket those are all of
the Christmas gifts that I received this
year I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video and maybe got a little bit of
inspiration from what I received that
you could potentially buy with your own
money that you received for Christmas
and honestly so grateful for everything
that I received I was spoiled so much
this year
I did not expect half of this stuff and
I know I'm posting this after Christmas
