little upload it's the last Christmassy
upload of the year can you guys believe
this like I'm actually really sad that
Christmas is almost over so to kind of
end the Christmassy period with a bang I
thought I would show you guys everything
that I got for Christmas in like a whole
type of thing and I really hope you guys
don't take this video the wrong way like
I'm not doing this to brag at all I am
so it's super grateful for everything
that I received this year like my family
and friends have just gone all out this
year and I'm so incredibly lucky I've
done this video last year as well and
you guys really enjoyed it so I thought
hey why not film it another year and
also this might help you guys to kind of
think of what to put on your wish list
for next year as well if you guys

on into the video okay so like I said my
family and friends just went all out
this year and I am just in awe of what
they've got me because I love every
single thing so much and I'm so super
grateful but I'm gonna start with
everything that my boyfriend Matt got
for me you guys know him from the vlogs
okay so the first thing he got me is in
a Victoria Secret bag which already has
me sold because I love Victoria Secret
so if you got me a few little bits from
that so the first thing is this little
gift set from Victoria's Secret it's got
all the different myths like body mists
so it has the bombshell the noughties
the love and the crush one and all of
these smell absolutely amazing I love
Victoria Secret body mist so this is a
winner and she also got me a Victoria
Secret love fragrance wash I'm totally
gonna put this in my bathroom as like a
hand wash I love the bottle is
absolutely adorable and the last thing
from Victoria's Secret is this little
rollerball perfume
this is the love perfume it just looks
like this it kind of just pops out this
little tube and you just roll it on as
you do oh it smells so good oh my god I
love this
everything from Victoria's Secret then
got me a few bits from Jo Malone which
you guys know I love Jo Malone like I
mentioned it in my gift guide video for
Christmas and I think she watched that
video and that's why he knows that I
love Jeremy line so the first thing he
got me came in this really adorable Joe
Mellon bag and it's basically a candle
like the one I showed you in my gift
guide but this one is a different scent
this is the English pear and freesia I
throw first of all I absolutely love the
packaging of jo Malone and this candle
just smells incredible it smells so
fresh and I'm probably just not gonna
even light it because I just don't even
want a lighter don't wanna waste it so
already I was like this is just amazing
like I love the gifts so far but then I
look under the Christmas tree and I see
another huge Jo balloon bag like this
which is just crazy because I loved Rome
alone and basically inside that bag was
this little gem alone gift set and it's
so beautifully packaged it's like a
little block of houses and you open it
up and it's just all the little things
that you can get from Jo Malone like
candles body scrubs Cologne what else
body gel
bath oil and also a cream and this is
just incredible like I can't wait to try
all of this next thing Matt got me is a
diffuser for the house because you guys
know probably if you watched my blogs
you know that I love anything that makes
my house smell amazing and so basically
he got me this little diffuser with two
oils that come with it and this was fun
I think John Lewis it's just basically
like a vapor diffuser you plug into the
mains and it will just basically squirt
out like this vapor type smell so it
really makes your house smell amazing
and I'm so so excited to put this up in
my living room so those were kind of
like my main presents from Matt and I'm
just so grateful for everything he got
me but it doesn't end there like I'm
just like so in all why did he get me so
many presents but the next thing he got
me is the set of cutlery which are rose
gold like copper cutlery
can't we just so this is what it looks
like it's from tesco and it's a 16 piece
cutlery
I just love it so much you guys know I
love anything copper my also know that I
really needed a new toothbrush like I
love having an electric toothbrush so he
actually got me a new one this is the
rose gold Phillips son sonic hair I
think um
toothbrush it's rose gold like he just
knows me so well guys this is so extra
having a rose gold toothbrush but I love
it so much I I forgot this one but this
is like my main main present and I love
it so much this is something that I
actually asked for from Matt that we
always every year we kind of say to each
other like one thing that we definitely
would love to receive but everything
else is just like like kind of like a
surprise so this is something I knew I
was getting so basically came in this
little box that he bought and inside was
a Kate Spade so this is what it came in
absolutely adorable and inside is the
prettiest Kate Spade bracelet oh my
goodness do you guys see this I'll show
you up close so this is what it looks
like
it basically resembles like a Cartier
bracelet but instead of like the bolts
there has gems inside it this is what it
looks like on it's just the prettiest
thing ever and I'm not really much of a
bracelet wearer but when I saw this I
was just like this is amazing it looks
like Cartier and Cartier is like up
there and it's so expensive I'd never be
able to get it but this is just the
prettiest thing I've I'm so happy he got
it for me next up he got me some little
bits and bobs it's like stocking fillers
so the first thing he got me is a Yankee
Candle car scent so this is the
turquoise sky basically like a smell for
your car I've always wanted this but I
always thought it's kind of overpriced I
think it's like 5 pounds for a car smell
and I wasn't sure if it would be worth
it but he got it for me as a stocking
filler so I'm really excited to try it
and he also got me some tea light
candles from Yankee Candle and these are
the Christmas Eve 12 candles you guys
know I love candles so I'm really
excited to try these he also got me a
box of these really adorable champagne
truffles which are so aesthetically
pleasing and the last thing that I got
from Matt is the stocking filler that is
a bottle and this
I'm going to the gym I am I am I am
basically trying to convince myself that
I am going to go to the gym one day so
that was everything from Matt he did so
well this year I actually can't believe
for how well he did and I'm so super
grateful for everything but now I'm
gonna move on to some presents that I
got from my parents the first thing I
got from them is actually a piece of
furniture because as you guys know I've
moved into our new house now and our
house is kind of like lacking in
furniture department so they got me this
really nice chair out insert a picture
here so you guys can see I just love it
so so much it's so me it's gray it's
perfect next thing I got from my parents
comes in this little box and it's
basically a Burberry scoffs oh this is a
vintage burberry scarf
this is something I've literally wanted
for absolutely ages but I could never
really like things to buy it myself but
my parents actually were now I'm got it
for me which I'm so happy about the next
thing my parents got me is a set of
towels from Hugo Boss so this is what
they look like they're just plain white
towels bar I always need towels
especially now that we've moved into the
new house next thing I got from my
parents is this little like copper tea
light holder I love little things like
this you guys know I love copper
evidently but yeah this is just so
pretty I'm not just sure where they got
this from because it hasn't got like a
label or anything but I really like it's
so cute and the very last thing that I
got from my parents is a new hairdryer
because I have such an old hairdryer
so they got me a Remington hairdryer
with like this little thing I don't even
know all that does I think it's like for
like cows or blow dry definitely gonna
use this a lot so thank you very much
that was everything from my parents next
up I'm gonna move on to presents from
Matt's mom so the first thing she got us
is a gift card for John the whiskers I
love John Lewis so does Matt so this is
just 150 pounds worth of like credit so
we can just buy ourselves anything
really that we want and then the next
thing she got us is this and it's a stag
head it's like a brass stag head that
you can attach either to a wall or to a
door I just have always wanted one of
these and I just never picked it up for
myself I don't really know why but I
love this so much and the last thing she
got me is this little thing which is
kind of like a planter or
maybe a tea light holder I'm not really
too sure but this is so aesthetically
pleasing you can put a little tea light
candle in there or maybe like a cactus
or something now moving on to Anthony
which is Matt's little brother the first
thing he got me is a little pillow which
is again copper he knows I love copper
so this is what it looks like but it's
really cool because when you run your
hand down it turns to black because it's
that kind of double sided secret
material which is so cool and then he
also got me some lush bath bombs which I
absolutely love oh look at that oh my
god that smells amazing I think that's a
lots of Apple and the last little thing
he got me is a notebook for 2018 it's
like a little planner kind of thing
I really really like this and I always
need something to help me stay organized
now from sherry Ann which is Matt's
sister I got a little cat stopper for a
wine bottle which is so cute I actually
love it in its copper as well they just
know me so well and then she also got me
some more stationery so in this one you
just have kind of like post-it notes and
it's all like marble themed which I
really really like oh I almost dropped
it back and then in this one there's
like a rubber some buttons some paper
clips and other paper clips and a pen
pencil that kind of thing and also a
notebook which is so right up my street
and I love like the color scheme and I
just love stationery in general let's be
honest Estela the next thing I got is
actually from my cousin and his wife so
they got me this little blanket from
Wilkinson's I love it so much I love
blankets I actually have like a whole
basket full of blankets for when guests
come over so this is a really nice
addition to my collection
and then lastly from my uncle and aunt
I've got a bottle of wine which I mean I
don't really drink wine but Matt does so
he'll definitely have this and then they
also got me this little acorn coaster
hold us and it's got some placemats for
like your cups and this is from next
it's really nice it's like a gold kind
of color I think it's so pretty it's
deafening and go on my coffee table they
also got me a pillow I mean there's
never enough pillows so this one says
our family might be a little crazy but
all the best people are which is
definitely very true and then the last
thing they got me is a little
because I love Canada's you just can't
go wrong with gifting someone a candle
so this one smells of ooh
frosted current oh that's not nice also
before I go I want to show you guys one
more gift to that Sheree and his mad
sister just literally gave me right now
and is basically this humongous look at
it and it says Rockstar is on there oh
my god this is initially one of the best
gifts I have ever received because it is
so cuddly so soft is this anything like
a huge humongous beanbag and the fact
that it says rock soros all that which
is obviously my channel name it's just
incredible so so it's so grateful for
sherry Ann and Luka who gave me this

they got this form because I feel like
it's such a cool gift it's actually a
lady on Etsy that makes these so I'll
