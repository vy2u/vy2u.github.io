what's on my iPhone video and
interestingly enough I did this video at
the beginning of my YouTube but I took
it down because it was just too
embarrassing for my life so I'm filming
everyone so I've recently been all of
our apps I've been discovering new ones
just really loving old ones and I'm just
gonna share with you guys basically
what's on my phone and my phone is the
iPhone 6 it's not like the bigger one
it's just the regular one and my phone
case has little palm trees on it I
cannot remember where this phone case is
from but I absolutely love it so right
from the top on the left hand side on
the first page of my phone I've got my
camera and my photos those two apps are
literally the most used apps on my phone
and then I've got my Gmail also amazing
I love having my Gmail instead of the
mail as you can see I've got a lot of
mails most of that is spam but Gina is
the one that I use for my emails then
the next row down is the most addictive
game ever it's called best fiends Sal
with best friends but it's best fiends
so basically the aim of this game is to
kind of go through all the different
levels on it and every level we have
some kind of challenge to overcome
there's like these no slugs which are
monsters and you have to battle them
with your own characters and your
characters develop like special powers
and defeat these horrible slugs and just
a quick fact I'm absolutely terrified of
slugs so this game is literally on point
for my life well they need to W kind of
unlock different characters that you
find along the way and then you can like
change them around so you can play as
different characters and you can grow
them and it's just absolutely adorable
like I love the graphics of this game as
an artist myself I really appreciate
like the animation and the graphics and
the illustrations that went into making
this app so yeah I've been absolutely
obsessed with that app it's just amazing
so I will have the link for the download
of this app if you guys wanna check it
out yourself I am currently on level 27
so I want to see if you guys can beat
that the next app I have is of course
the App Store then I have my Google
browser because I don't really like this
Safari one that the I think comes with
and then I've got videos clock settings
calendar reminders calculator
like the utility kind of bits and bobs
or the boring stuff basically and then I
have my Barclays banking app which is
like a lifesaver and also the PayPal app
then I have a music and Deezer Deezer is
like amazing it's basically like an
iTunes but it's just an app and you
don't have to pay for the songs one by
one you pay like a monthly fee and then
you get like unlimited music and you can
download the songs onto your phone so
you can like listen to them when you
haven't got internet access or anything
like that so I am loving that app as
well at the moment then I have my
Twitter Instagram Tumblr and if youtube
if you guys want to check me out on any
of those you know the drill chambers
promote then I have my deep hop app
which is really cool as well then I have
like four folders including different
apps some I don't really use and some I
do I just like to kind of keep them in
one place so that it's not cluttered all
over the kind of like dashboard of my
phone first I have the folder with all
the boring stuff that no one ever uses
such as I change you Garage Band stocks
health then I have my extras with like
compost tips and voicemails pages I put
my Safari and messenger in here as well
just because I don't use them either
then I have the lifestyle group and I've
got my Etsy snaps clue Fridays that's
TGI Fridays subway card oh my god I'm
obsessed with Subway's so this is my
most used folder which is the
photography folder and this is where I
keep all of my editing apps so I have
like insta Beauty photo collage I've got
white a gram visco and some other stuff
here I will go through this in detail
but if you guys would like to see like a
video of how I edit my Instagram photos
then definitely let me know down below
and I might do that for you because some
of you said that you like my feed and
you were wondering how I edit my photos
then lastly I've got a few bits here
which is my skype app I use this
sometimes to Skype Matt so then the apps
that I have at the bottom here are the
phone Facebook snapchat and messages and
those are just like
one of the most used apps on my phone
and if you're wondering with the
background that I have on here is an
illustration that I did if you guys want
to check out my illustration blogs I'll
also be down below it's at the moment
just my University work like the
projects that I get but I also post some
like drawings that I just do for myself
on there as well so that is all for this
video if you guys have any like cool
apps that I might be interested in to
check out then let me know down below
and I will check them out so that's all
for this video if you guys enjoyed this
