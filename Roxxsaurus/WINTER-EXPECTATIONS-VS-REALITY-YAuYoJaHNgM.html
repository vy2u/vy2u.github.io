channel I hope you guys are doing it
super well so today I'm going to be
doing a winter expectations vs. reality
video and I'm really really excited so
this video is going to be a few
scenarios of what winter is expected to
be like but then also when it's actually
like once it rolls around and both all
the time winter is nothing like you
expect it to be so I'm really excited to
film this video and I've never done a
video like this before so I hope you
guys enjoy it if you guys do enjoy it
and are excited for winter make sure you
smash that huge thumbs up just down
below and also subscribe if you are new
I would love to have your hair I also
have a vlog channel called rocks or as
vlogs I'll leave it in there little iron
the corner so you guys can check it out
because I'm going to be doing that
vlogmas
this year which means I'm going to be
posting a video every single day
throughout the month of December on my
vlog channel so if you guys want to keep
up with my Christmasy antics then make
sure you guys subscribe I'm also gonna
be doing a follow spree on my Instagram
to attend snapchat once this video goes
live because I really want to follow
some of you guys so make sure you head
over there and follow me so I can follow
you back and another video let's get
into the video so the first winter
expectations is winter clothes now the
expectation is obviously to have like
really nice bobble hat and like a nice
couch and a little Jack here you know
just looking really cute and really put
together but in reality your outfit does
not look on point it's actually like 10
different layers
they all look terrible you just want to
try and keep as long as possible because
it's so cold outside and your coat is so
tight from all the layers underneath
that you can't even move to wake up and
makeup
I can't put my arms down so the next
winter expectation is being really
excited for Christmas braids as soon as
school finishes you're like oh my
goodness yes this is gonna be the best
thing ever
yes funny schools I'm so excited
one moment soon now I want to see my
friends this is boring Christmas
holidays suck the next winter
expectation is having a perfectly
wrapped gift so you know like the gifts
you see in like adverts and like on TV
it always looks so perfect and nicer
right the little bone within but the
expectation for winter is given out
amazingly wrap gifts I love wrapping
Christmas gifts
but reality you're not scared of
wrapping gifts as you think you are
hi guys something a little bit like this
don't nobody said it takes a have to do
now the next winter expectation is a
cold weather now the expectation here is
that you go out and you conquer the day
as usually would every single day
but the reality is slightly different it
is so freezing that you literally cannot
leave the house
no way
I'm never going out again I tried the
next winter expectation is snow snow
everywhere you just want to go out and
play in it and it's so much fun in
actual fact it's kind of impossible
especially here in England because as
soon as a tiny bit of snow falls which
is very rare by the way it just turns
into like the nasty slush and mud
straightaway if you're bored why don't
you get the outside
this next song I think everyone has done
at least once in their life but other
reality is much different after having
one chocolate you can't stop bad you
just kinda
so that was my winter expectations vs.
reality video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it as I said it was my first
time doing this kind of video so I hope
you guys liked any would like to see
