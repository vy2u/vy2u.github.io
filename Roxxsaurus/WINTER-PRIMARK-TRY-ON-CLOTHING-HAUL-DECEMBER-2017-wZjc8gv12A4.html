today I have a winter Primark haul for
you guys and I am so excited for this
video however my bank account probably
isn't because I spent way too much money
on this stylishly walked out for my
Martens like three bags worth of winter
clothes so but it had to be done it had
to be done there Before we jump straight
into the video I quickly wanted to
mention an app that I've been using
lately and it's called a 21 buttons I've
actually mentioned this app on my
channel already in the past and I've
just been loving it lately for those of
you who haven't seen me talk about it
before it's basically like an app like
kind of like Instagram but fur like
beauty and fashion but the cool thing
about this app is that basically you can
tag the direct clothing item like in an
outfit post and it will take you
straight to the website where that
person has bought it from so if you ever
wondered where a blogger has purchased
like an item of clothing and you try to
find it on like a social somewhere and
you could never find it
this app is perfect for you and
basically I've just been posting a bunch
of my outfit photos on there and just
tagging everything that I have worn I'm
currently on 78 0.7 K followers and I
really want to get to 80 K by the end of
this year so if you guys would like to
help me reach that goal I'll leave my
handle down in the downbar it's
basically just a proc Loris as
everything also I forgot to mention that
if you make your own account on this app
you can actually start earning
Commission which is so cool because
actually anyone can be like a beauty
influence of these days just by signing
up to the account oh yeah this app is
just so appropriate for this video
because obviously it's very fashion
based so if you guys would like to
follow me it's just a Troxler is it so
make sure you guys go check it out it
came up without further ado let's get
how I just hit myself in the face let's
get on into the video okay so the first
item of clothing I literally cannot like
can not so the first item is a fluffy
cow obviously I have actually got one of
these but in black from last year and
it's literally the most comfiest coat
ever it's so fluffy and warm and I just
love it
obviously it's faux fur I actually got
this in a size 20 I didn't even realize
this is gonna be huge but actually I
quite like that it's gonna be quite
oversized and cozy
and how much was this actually this was
20 pounds oh my god what a bargain the
next thing I got is a cozy little jumper
cuz obviously I've been loving like knit
jumpers so I picked up this one which is
like a really nice v-neck kind of jumper
it's very like fuzzy and it's white cuz
I love like like colored kind of knit
jumpers like I have a weakness for those
this was only ten pounds which is
actually so good and it's quite like
oversized as well I got like a little
bit of a larger size so I can like tuck
it into my jeans and be your cool I then
got myself a cheeky little brawler and
this is so like Christmas themed it's
like a red velvet and it's got a little
bow on the side it's not quite as thick
like band across the bottom as well
which is really nice and yeah I just got
that how much was this actually ooh
this was three pound fifty oh my god no
way that's like actually so good
did you realize it was only three pounds
50 the next item is a pair of shoes now
these shoes I actually really really
like and you guys might be a bit like
I'm not too sure about them it's kind of
like a love it or hate it sort of thing
but I saw these on the Primark Instagram
and I was like I need those so these are
the shoes and oh my god that's so cool
they're kind of like a sock boot type of
shoe and they're just simple black like
heels but they have these two white
stripes along the top and I just really
like them I thought they were so like
different they don't even look like
primary look like misguided or like
pretty little thing or something
and how much were these actually I have
no idea these actually don't have the
price sadly and I haven't got the
receipt on me but I can kind of estimate
that this would probably be like 15
pounds or something which is like your
typical kind of price for shoes at
Primark the next item I got is a chunky
scarf now this is a gray scarf as you
can see there's not really that much to
it it's basically like a cable knit
scarf this was eight pounds which is
again at really affordable the reason
why I got it is because I'm kind of
obsessed with scars at the moment I
don't know why I don't know where this
addiction has developed from but I've
been buying way too many scar
over the past like two months or so and
this is definitely gonna feed my scarf
addiction the next thing I got it has a
slightly bit more color than all of the
items I currently showed you and is
basically this really big oversized
jumper this is kind of again like a knit
type of jumper I got this in a size
large as you can see because I really
wanted that huge like oversized kind of
effect I've been loving that kind of
thing lately as you can probably tell by
my jumper at the moment so yeah I just
got this one I really like the color of
it it's kind of like a burnt orange type
of color it's very soft and how much was
this this was 10 pounds so again so
affordable like Primark is so good for
jumpers and just like like payback is
just so good I then adventure into the
world of color a little bit and I picked
up this jumper which is so cool I love
the like design of it I love the fact
that it's got three colors and even
though it's quite a colorful jumper it's
like muted colors that I would actually
wear so that's all good and as you can
see I got it in the size and just again
to be a little bit more oversized and
this was 13 pounds which again bargain I
then just picked up a pair of jeans
because you can't go wrong with the pair
of jeans I got this in a size 8 and
these are the high waist skinny denim
jeans
obviously and basically they're so so
stretchy and nice but they're like that
thick material which is good because I
always love having that like body
hugging kind of Jean like I don't like
my jeans to be too thin if that makes
any sense this next item is quite an
expensive item for Primark especially
I've never bought anything as expensive
business at Primark and basically this
really pretty long beige kind of coat
and this cost me 40 pounds which it is
pricey for Primark but when you think
about it cuts like this are always so
expensive and it's actually like really
good quality material it's got a lot of
weight to it obviously the colour is a
faux fur but it's so soft and really
nice
I've got this in the smallest size
possible I've got it in a size 8 because
I knew that these type of coats aren't
usually quite big on me Sonia I just got
it in size a and I can't wait to wear
this it's so nice I've then gotten some
slippers because Primark literally have
such a huge selection of like slippers
and robes and like pajamas and stuff
like that I've really liking wearing my
current slippers that I have on which
are little bunny rabbits and I think
these might be from acid or something I
don't really know but I'm obsessed with
slippers as well so I picked up these
ones here and they're just like really
fuzzy white goodness slippers they have
two little pom-poms and these are four
pounds which is so affordable this is
what they look like on the bottom and
they're definitely gonna keep my little
Tootsie's warm in the winter I then
picked up their cutest bathrobe for
winter from Primark and it's this one
here it's a reindeer and it's so cute
it's got little eyelashes I absolutely
love it it's like a very thin material
which is perfect for just like lounging
around the house but the lining is so
soft it's kind of like a fleece lining
and I just want to live in this and it's
just so cute and so appropriate for
winter and the bathroom was at 13 pounds
continuing that reindeer theme I also
got some cute little gloves of reindeers
on them because I just couldn't resist
they basically have the same kind of
design on them they've got the little
eyelashes the little antlers and a
little red pom-pom for the nose and
these were only 2 pounds so whilst I was
in the kind of accessories section I
also picked up this little head warmer
kind of headband thing and basically I
just focus was so cute for winter
obviously I wouldn't wear this with my
hair up so I'm not gonna show you how it
looks on but this would look so cute
when I have my hair down I hope it's not
weird to show you guys bras because the
world friends around here so I just
picked up a white and a new t-shirt bra
from Primark because I really liked that
t-shirt bras and they fit me really well
so I just picked up those as well and
the last item is kind of like a joke you
guys might laugh at me for this but
basically I picked up a
her dress outfit kind of thing for
Christmas I thought that it might be
cute to wear this for actual Christmas
Day or maybe Christmas Eve but I don't
know now I don't know if I'm gonna wear
this do you guys think I should wear
this for Christmas and it's also got a
little hat as well as it was Santa hat I
thought this was so adorable I really
like it but I don't know if I'll have
the guts to actually wearing it on
Christmas Day and this was a 16 pattern
so that is all for my Primark winter
haul I really hope you guys enjoyed if
