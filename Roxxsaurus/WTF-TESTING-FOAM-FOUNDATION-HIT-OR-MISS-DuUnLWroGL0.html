I'm going to be testing out a very
strange product now this is a product
that's actually been recommended by you
guys for me to test out and the product
is this foundation right here so this is
the Elizabeth Arden flawless finish
mousse makeup foundation oh my god
that's a mouthful but basically this is
the foundation it's very very strange
because it's actually a mousse like you
shake it and then it comes out as mousse
which then blends into like a normal
foundation I have never tried anything
like this before so I'm kind of nervous
but kind of excited if you guys are
brand new and have never seen my face
before come and join and the dinosaur
family by scrolling down below and also
don't forget to click at the
notification bar button to stay notified
every time I post a new video but if you
guys want to see what the deal is with
this foundation right here then let's
get on into the video okay so first
things first I just want to clarify I am
wearing makeup at the moment I've got my
like I makeup on and lips but of course
I haven't got any foundation on to this
video because we're going to be testing
out this one so this foundation actually
cost me at 26 pounds at boots we're just
kind of pricing when you think about it
especially because this is a 50 ml
bottle it is quite a small foundation
bottle I'm kind of worried how much I'm
actually gonna use up of this in the
first go because obviously it's a mousse
formula so I have no idea how that
performs if a little bit is gonna go a
long way or not so I guess we shall see
in this video quick thing I just want to
point out before we apply this
foundation is that I actually noticed it
has a very poor selection of colors so
there's only six shades to this
foundation which I was kind of like what
it was quite difficult to actually
choose my own shade and I have no idea
if I did the right job I got it in 25
bisque so I don't know it might be too
dark for me I'm just putting that out
there I'm not saying this is gonna be my
shade this is what the foundation looks
like it just comes out in like a pumpy
sort of squeezy top yeah let's put this
to the test
see I'm into shake it well before you
use it and let's see what this is gonna
be like I'm scared oh nothing's coming
oh my god oh okay
it's kind of getting stuck to the bottle
but
Wow look at that that's so cool right
let's do a little bit more oh that's so
cool that is such weird consistency what
the heck let's like try and touch it
whoa it's like so oh my god it's falling
off my hand uh-oh Oh mission abort it is
like literally foam like bubbles of
foundation it's so like bouncy and light
that's so weird
okay so on the box right here it says
that it's for normal skin whatever that
means and then it's got natural coverage
with a translucent finish so it's
definitely not gonna be like full
coverage which is kind of what I tend to
like sway toward I love like a medium
coverage personally so I don't know if
I'm gonna like this but we're still
gonna give it a shot this foundation is
meant to look like your own skin this
light airy cloud of color covers just
enough but let's the skin breathe I'm
kind of ready my body is ready to dry
this out apparently you're meant to
apply this with your fingers onto your
skin I tend to use a brush or a Beauty
Blender but I have no problem with
applying it to my face with fingers but
I am also gonna test it out with a
Beauty Blender on the left hand side and
just to see how the different sides
perform
okay so first up I'm just gonna do at
the regular side and just apply a little
bit straight to my face oh that is just
so weird it's like falling off my face I
look so weird this honestly has to be
the weirdest foundation I've ever seen
in my life is getting really messy I
probably should oh you just fell off my
chin no it felt my top I probably should
have just put this on the back of my
hand but I wanted to see these bubbles
of my face I already wanted to see how
it felt literally guys look at this
why okay enough messing about I'm gonna
blur this now and I literally can tell
it's not gonna be my shade I mean look
at this it is definitely not gonna be my
shade this little bits trying to fall
off my nose I don't think so sir I
merely use my fingers first I feel like
I applied way too much but we're just
gonna go with it
oh look at this oh my god yeah this is
definitely not my shade but we're just
gonna roll with it okay this feels so
weird
okay wait I've been playing way too much
I'm not like King Arthur looking at the
moment if it was really light on the
skin it definitely doesn't feel cakey
but this section right here is making
all of the hairs on my face like really
wet like do you guys see this like you
can see every single hair that's so so
not good it's really easy to blend into
the skin because obviously it just kind
of melts like as you touch it it just
melts into like this liquidy sort of
formula which is quite cool because it's
very easy to blend but I'm just not
liking this hair situation right here
I'm wondering if you can actually get
rid of this it has a strange like smell
this foundation I don't know how to
describe it but it kind of smells like
Chanel number five a little bit okay
face wipe to the rescue oh my god I'm
looking slow tanga I'm gonna try my
blend this down my neck as well a little
bit it's actually not that bad you know
like it actually has a decent coverage
for me like I can't really see any of my
blemishes anymore which is kind of good
well like it's starting to kind of look
a bit better it is definitely not my
shade as you can see but I'm just not
the best of matching myself at all it's
a very like dewy foundation it's super
shiny I'm definitely gonna have to set
it with something but it feels really
lightweight on my skin like it
definitely doesn't feel like I don't
know it doesn't feel like I've got
anything on to be honest apart from like
moisturizer maybe and I'm not gonna try
and blend out the other side with my wet
Beauty Blender to see how that goes I
feel like the Beauty Blender is gonna be
a little bit better just because
whenever I use my hands for foundation I
can never really get an even blend yeah
the view blender is definitely doing a
way better job than my hands can oh I'm
liking it I'm actually really liking it
of the Beauty Blender I feel like this
side is definitely a lot more cake so
than the left hand side coz I applied
quite a bit of product and always
when you use a beauty blender it kind of
takes away some of that product so this
side is like perfect I think so now the
foundation is fully on I can now judge
the situation by looking up close and
honestly she already impressed with this
foundation it's not really like creasing
too much because it's obviously so
lightweight it has covered most of my
blemishes there's still like a little
bit of like redness right here from like
a spot that I had but honestly it's
actually not as bad as I thought it'd be
this on the box it obviously says it's
got like a translucent finish so I was
thinking okay what is this foundation
gonna be but it's actually proven to be
quite good I'm also glad that I tested
it out with the two different techniques
like with the fingers and the Beauty
Blender because obviously that kind of
gives you guys a comparison as well and
how this product works but obviously
this foundation still isn't high enough
in coverage to like cover my dark
circles so I am still gonna go in with
my trusty Maybelline fit me concealer
gotta get rid of them eye bags they're
so not Gucci I think it would be quite
good to see how this foundation wears
with other products on top which is why
I'm applying the rest of my makeup as I
usually would I'm also gonna add a
little bit of bronzer although I don't
really need it anymore I'm so Orange but
I'm still gonna do a little bit just at
the cheekbones as I usually do cuz my
face is so shiny I don't even need
highlight right now look at this okay
this foundation is just calling out to
me to be set right now because it's just
so shiny so for this I'm gonna use my
Rimmel stay matte powder this is what my
favorite powders that I've been using at
the moment we're just gonna tame this a
little bit I mean I love jewry
foundation but this is just a bit much
and last but not least I'm gonna just
pop a little bit of highlighter on so
I'm gonna be using my Becca moonstone
trusty highlighter and I'm just gonna
pop a little bit of that on the
cheekbones look like glow highlighter is
literally my favorite part and he makeup
I would love like absolutely love to
have my own highlighter palette I
actually tweeted this out the other day
and you guys are like oh my god yes I
need this let me know if you guys would
like a highlighter palette any time soon
because I can make it happen maybe maybe
I'm not saying anything said that is my
makeup complete I am actually
the skin like the skin I think looks
really good this issue with the hairs is
definitely over like I've blended it all
out so it's definitely not a problem
anymore I kind of want to put this
foundation to the test actually so I'm
gonna head out for a few hours and then
I'm gonna come back and just let you
guys know what I think how the skin wore
and all that kind of stuff so I'll see
you guys in a little bit oh my good is
so silly out there okay so I've been
wearing this foundation for probably the
past four hours or so I went out I did
some eating mainly I went to subway and
I just walked around town that kind of
thing but yes I have had this foundation
on for quite some time now so I kind of
feel like I can make a judgement of how
long lasting I think this foundation
might be they said before hours I can
definitely see that my skin is getting a
lot more oily so it's definitely not
going to be the longest lasting
foundation I've ever use I can tell you
that I have had a little close-up look
in the mirror as well and I can kind of
see my blemishes peeking through again
on like the cheeks so I feel like yeah
it's definitely gonna be one of those
foundations that you can sort of wear
maybe on holiday because it's so
lightweight it's not like full coverage
so it's perfect for like when you're
going away someone you don't want to
wear off makeup as for everyday I
probably wouldn't wear this foundation
again just because I prefer my
foundation to be a lot more
longer-lasting throughout the day so
that I don't need to worry about it and
touch-up and all that kind of stuff
that's not to say I don't like the
foundation at all because I obviously so
do like it but I just wouldn't really
recommend it for everyday it's
definitely just one of those like Airy
lightweight foundations that I would
probably wear more on holiday but yes
that is the verdict on this foundation I
honestly feel like I am gonna give this
one a thumbs up just because I still
quite like here I think it will
definitely work for some people just
because it didn't really work for me I
feel like it will work for people who
don't really like to wear too high
coverage of makeup let me know where you
guys thought of this foundation below as
well the comment and what products you
would like me to try out next I love
trying out like weird products all the
time so if you guys have any suggestions
and do let me know in the comments below
that is all from me thank you so much
for watching and I hope to see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
