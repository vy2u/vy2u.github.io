hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys are doing super
well I thought I would have a little bit
of fun today and tried this reverse full
face of makeup I'm pretty sure what I
haven't seen this video done on YouTube
before I've seen some like variations of
the reverse makeup like thing going
around and I've seen people do like the
reverse steps of doing makeup but for
example usually you would do like your
base aka like your primer first but they
do it last so I've seen that but I've
never seen that people actually do like
a full and reverse makeup kind of thing
disclaimer this is just a little bit of
fun um this video is not to be taken
seriously it's just literally a little
bit of fun that you guys can do with
your friends if you like love for this
to turn into like a challenge slash tag
thing going around on YouTube so if any
of you guys are bored and would like to
recreate this madness then I'm
challenging all of you to do this don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoy it and also subscribe if
you're brand new I'd love to have you
here
I've also got I'll tell her you guys so
I'll leave it in the little eye in the
corner so you guys can check it out i'm
doing vlogmas at the moment and i'm
actually thinking about doing daily
vlogging for just just a little while
after christmas it's gonna be so much
fun and I'm really enjoying ok go
without the rambling let's get into the
city okay so I'm gonna whoa okay that is
very up close and personal so I actually
have my base on I thought there's not
really a way you can reverse foundation
that is my escape to the foundation and
I'm going to move straight to contour so
I've got my Maybelline master precise
contour stick and I'm just going to
apply the contour shade onto my
cheekbone okay I'm scared okay so I'm
applying it where I would usually apply
highlighter this looks so wrong already
imagine if this is how we actually did
makeup it looks like I'm sick I'm doing
some tribal like face paint okay so my
highlight is done it looks ridiculous
I'm gonna do a little bit on the tip of
my nose and the bridge of my nose this
is just terrible okay I'm gonna do some
on my forehead but
usually apply my highlight that illumise
any added estimable doesn't wear as what
I apply highlight this is really hard to
figure out
I think I'd apply it here then maybe
here as well I'm not going to go in with
the actual highlight and apply this as
my contour oh okay this just looks
terrifying because I would apply like
contour here down the bridge of my nose
and apply it in my temples as well I
think this is a new look you guys I
think this is like the new Instagram
makeup what do you think I'm thinking is
this worth blending out now or should I
leave it until the very end just so you
can see the full-on effect of this
reverse makeup we're going to leave a
unblended and now moving on to the eyes
so I'm going to be taking my Urban Decay
Naked ultimate basics palette and I'm
going to do quite a dramatic reverse I
makeup so I'm going to go in with faith
which is this brown shadow and I'm gonna
apply this not in the outer crease but
in the inner crease and then I'm going
to take this black eye shadow and now
black is one of those shadows you just
can't reverse like once it's on there's
no getting rid of it so this is very
brave of me I'm taking the blackest
eyeshadow I own and I'm applying that in
my inner corner to define my inner
crease Const I've ever done this for
reals
so this just feels really wrong like all
makeup rules are broken in this moment
the beauty Bible is being thrown out the
window
the queen of makeup nikkietutorials saw
this she would be crying her eyes out
I'm applying some black eyeshadow into
my inner corner which is making me look
like I have my eyes really close
together so now we have our outer corner
as our in a corner I'm going to go in to
my outer corner which is technically my
inner corner now with this is so
confusing I'm going to be applying this
light shade which is pre-game from the
same palette
this looks so weird honestly
moving right along I'm going to be
applying some liquid liner and guess
what yes you've guessed it I'm going to
be applying the wing in my inner corner
why why not why not hmm I don't know how
this is gonna go I've never done this
before
like I don't think anyone has ever done
this before but you know what in the
world is that like what in the world am
i doing to myself this is honestly the
strangest thing I've ever done to my eye
makeup
you guys are my under if this was like
the new Instagram trend and you did this
with your eyeliner and this was called
eyeliner on fleek from now on it's
really surprising how well my eyeliner
turned up okay I take that back
what what what I don't think I've ever
looked better than this like I think
I've ever honestly gone from like a 5 to
a solid 10 if you guys see like
celebrities doing this with their eye
makeup then just know like it started
right here right now make sure you
credit makeup artist rocks for us cos
I'm so good at makeup I'm just trying to
think how much further can we take this
think I'm gonna go in with some false
lashes on just my bottom lashes and see
how that looks
okay here it guys this looks terrifying
it's just so uncomfortable to blink in
I'm now moving on to the brows so I'm
just gonna brush them through and then
I'm gonna apply a really really dark eye
shadow to my inner corner for those of
you who are brow enthusiasts watching
this video you're probably screaming
right now
oh yeah work that brow work that Brown
what's that bro Cara Delevingne bold
brows gone wrong I don't know about you
guys but I think these brows are just
very vogue like I've always wanted to
rock the HD browsing I think I nailed it
I'm going to take some light colored
brow gel and just brush that through the
ends to make them lighter so we get that
you know that HD
gradient brow going on no that's
something and lastly I'm gonna do my
lips so I'm gonna go for like an ombre
but reverse ombre so I'm gonna apply
this bad boy in the center of my lips
which is like this dark brown liquid
lipstick by Too Faced
so let's do it so now that I'm looking
like a Japanese doll I'm gonna go in
with the lighter shade and apply this to
my outer corners I think this looks
pretty horrendous I'm a little bit proud
of myself for accomplishing this
ridiculous challenge okay I don't think
I'm better on the internet so you're
welcome guys I honestly don't know where
to begin
I think my favorite part is definitely
the inward eyeliner the contour looks
very patchy I think I genuinely look
like something that has just stepped out
of a horror movie
I hope you guys found this video slash
challenge fun or entertaining to watch
please don't take this seriously like
this is just a bit of fun doesn't really
have a purpose but it's fun to watch fun
to do and makeup is just so fun to apply
I feel like there's so many rules when
it comes to makeup and everything has to
be the certain way you can't ever make
mistakes so this was actually really
liberating to do because literally
everything on my face is wrong there's
nothing right about it this experience
was actually quite therapeutic I would
say so if any of you guys would like to
try this make sure you tag me recreate
it right now tag me on instagram twitter
send it to me on snapchat want to see
anything hope you're really awesome to
see you guys recruiting this and seeing
what kind of wacky makeup you can come
up with this video was so fun to film
and I really hope you guys enjoyed it
and if you did make sure you smash that
huge thumbs up I feel like my eyelashes
like poke him in the eye also I think
I'm brand new here make sure you guys

you're new don't think I look like this

trying to explain myself but I'm digging
myself a bigger hole make sure you guys
