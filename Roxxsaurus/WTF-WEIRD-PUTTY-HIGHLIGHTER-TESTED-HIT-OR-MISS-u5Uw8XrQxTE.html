I've got a nail polish in my hair
already well that's just great
hello everyone welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys I had an awesome
day so far
so today I'm super duper excited because
I'm going to be testing out a product
that is like really weird and I've never
seen anything like this before and it's
the stealer
highlighter this highlighter is actually
in putty form like how weird is that I
actually stumbled across this pearlized
when I was trying to find like a weird
product to test up for you guys and
beauty related and this was on one of
the lists on the article that I read and
I was like yes girl this is what I need
before we jump straight into the video
and make sure you guys smash that huge
thumbs upses down below it helps out so
much and also subscribe if you haven't
already because guess what we are so
close to 2 million dinosaurs on this
channel and I could not be more grateful
for every single one of you thank you so
much for supporting me yes just just
subscribe if you haven't already because
we're very close and I am going to be
doing like a huge massive gigantic 2
million subscriber giveaway when we get
there and it's actually going to be like
the biggest thing ever like I'm never
done and giveaway this big so I'm super
excited by the way I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret I also have a daily
vlogging channel so like not a lot of
people know that but I actually do so if
you guys do not get enough dosage of me
on this channel you can always head over
to rocks or is vlogs and we can hang out
every single day I feel like I'm in a
really weird mood so let's just get up
into the video ok so first things first
and this is the highlighter it's from
the brand that stealer I haven't
actually tried out that many products
from Stila I have a mascara from them
which I actually personally really like
so this is going to be my second at
Steeler product which I'm excited to try
and this is called at the heavens a hue
my lighter I got this in shade kitchen
which personally represents my life
because I'm a cat lady so I have to pick
up get it and they also have two other
shades so it's three in total but I
thought if I don't like this there's no
point having two other highlighters that
I'm never going to use so I only picked
up one just
right so basically when I saw this
product online I was like this is
majestic
this is literal magic so I'm kind of
scared as soon as I open this there
might be like a unicorn popping out you
never know let's open it together what
okay so this is the product you've got a
little like safety seal oh it's a little
bit dented anyway so the product is like
this really nice shimmery kind of rose
gold champagne kind of color I'm not
very good at explaining things but this
is a really pretty color
I can't wait just watch it I just can't
wait to shove my finger in this putty
and test out if it actually is squidgy
as it looked in the picture so this is
the product I'm just gonna squish my
finger in oh oh my god that is so cool
oh my god that is insane that's like so
much fun this is like play-doh but adult
version oh it is literally so satisfying
do you feel like this could be kind of
dangerous I like this product now hear
me out I think you know if you're just
rushing for school for work and use this
highlighter you kind of could get
carried away and start playing with it
and yeah you'd be very late for work or
school firm
I don't know buy this at your home
discretion okay so just from playing
with this product I don't worry tell
this is like so much fun but let's
actually put it to the test and swatch
it swatch up my hands swatch on my face
and see it what we think so I'm
literally just going to use my finger
and I'm going to give you guys a little
swatch from my hand that is so pretty oh
my god that is beautiful okay I'm
playing this on my face right now okay
I've got my trusty a highlighter brush
let's zoom you guys in so you can see my
skin
and I can't wait to literally try this
I'm so excited okay to blow that bad way
in and I'm just going to apply this to
my cheekbone I'm dead
oh my god I so pretty
Wow that is a very very blinding barrel
that is so pretty oh oh my god I love it
I love it what do you guys think I
literally feel like a majestic unicorn
slash mermaid slash just everything
that's good so not gonna lie I was quite
skeptical of this highlighter because
when I picked up on the brush I was like
huh there's literally nothing on here
but then I applied as my cheek and it
was like whoa BAM I am very impressed
with this highlighter I think that this
could be my new favorite I'm going to do
the other side of my face as well but
I'm actually going to use my fingers
because on the actual description of the
product it says that you can use a brush
or your fingers because the product is
so easy to blend into the skin that it
should kind of melt into your skin even
if user fingers so let's do it
play with it some more this is so fun
honestly it's kind of like therapeutic a
little bit like a stress toy but in
highlighter form oh that is so pretty
I'm done I'm done why did I not buy this
highlighter sooner because it is slaying
my life right now what do you guys think
cuz I am in love what else can I say
this is just another apply a little bit
onto my collarbone because a lot of the
time when you apply any kind of
highlighter to your like chest area it
doesn't actually show up actually
showing up oh my god yes and the
shoulder got to get that shoulder
highlight going ah boom boom
a highlighter feels so lightweight on
the skin like I can't even tell you and
when it says that it melts into your
skin like I definitely agree that it
does because I don't get that like
patchy kind of powdery chalky highlight
like it's all kind of like nicely
diffused around the edges I don't know
if you can see that camera but in real
life in my mirror I can definitely see
that I forgot to say that this
highlights had 10 grams inside of
products so I feel like that's a pretty
fair price
like it was 28 pounds which for a
high-end kind of product you would pay
that anyways so I definitely think that
this is worth it because it is kind of
like novelty like it's really fun to
play with but it does the job like this
is so much more pigmented than like so
many highlights that I own that are
already like way more expensive than
this so I just need give this a huge
thumbs up and would recommend so that is
the end of the video I had so much fun
trying out this product I'm so glad that
I purchased it because it literally
slays like this highlight I can't stop
looking at it in my little viewfinder
it's so pretty so I definitely would
recommend it I definitely think that
this is a rock source approved so yeah
I'll link it down below if any of you
are interested in buying this by the way
this isn't sponsored or anything I'm
literally just testing this out and I am
just a huge fan so yeah I thought I'd
help you guys out I'll have a link in
the description I again there's the end
of the video I really hope you guys
enjoyed if you would like to see any
more of these like weird products tested
out on this channel and let me know what
products you would like me to test

weird products like in the beauty realm
