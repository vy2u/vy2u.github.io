how to do this quick vampy slash grungy
kind of look that's wearable and you can
wear everyday so they can start so I've
already applied my foundation and I used
a Mac Studio sculpt with SPF 15 and
shade NC 35 and I've also filled in my
eyebrows just to save time
okay so first step is we're gonna work
really eyes and I'm using the sleek
palette install five seven eight and I
always use choose my favorite and movies
in this shade here which is the light
brown matte shade and you can't even see
that because I use it so much and we're
going to be using this as the base shape
so we're just taking that on our big
fluffy brush like so and we're putting
that all over the lid and this is going
to give us a not kind of sleepy and
tired effect that's what we want
next step is taking the brown shadow
this one here and a smaller more precise
brush and putting that on closest to the
lash line really messy
so don't worry if it's messy because
we're just gonna blend out in a minute
anyway so then taking a small fluffy
brush we just want to blend everything
away to create a nice transition of the
two colors next as supposed to eyeliner
I'm going to be using some eye shadow to
actually act as a eyeliner but just to
create a kind of more softer look so for
this I'm going to be using this shadow
right here which you can't really see
either way it's from the gosh eyebrow
kit and it's just a really dark kind of
gray color and I think all very well and
I'm using this angled brush from Mac to
apply it
next time just got to apply some mascara
and I'm using the body collection one
which has collagen in it and I'm just
going to apply a few clips on place so
once we're done with the eyes you can
move on to contouring and I'm using this
fluffy brush once more and a topi kind
of shade a few shades darker than my
skin to use as a contour shadow I'm just
taking that up into the nose bridge kind
of area to depth in the eye sockets and
then I'm also going down my nose bridge
to contour that area also
next I'm using my Avon bronzer in a
radiant glow and I'm just taking a
angled brush loading that up onto it and
just sculpting my face with this giving
the cheekbones and my face a bit more
definition I'm actually not going to be
using a bronzer for this look salt my
face kind of pale and with colorless I
guess because you are trying to look a
bit like a vampire so I figured there
wouldn't be any life to your face so I'm
just going to skip the lipstick and the
lipsticks I'm going to use is this one
from anyway and it's in shade 11 it's
this kind of nudie slash pinky color it
shows up a much darker than it actually
is
it's kind of like the shade of your lips
but just a bit darker and then I'm also
using the Gothic glam from collection
and it's in revenge very which is this
gorgeous really plummy kind of red color
sets perfect for this kind of Gothic
look so were these two lipsticks I'm
going to be creating sort of a gradient
so first I'm applying this one all over
the lip
like so and then I'm going in with dark
red and what I'm going to do is this
lipstick it is I'm going to put it on
the center of my lip only then I just
lose my finger and I'm going to kind of
merge the two close together and this is
the final look guys I hope you enjoyed
this video I hope I helped you love it
and maybe you can draw some inspiration
from this it's a very kind of wearable
look it's more on the dramatic side I
guess you could say but it's definitely
where I go throughout the whole day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
