channel I hope you guys all wow this is
you guys I'm really enjoying my back to
school series I thought I would film
another video for you guys this time
rather than sharing hacks and DIYs with
you guys I thought I would actually test
them out so you can actually see if they
work or not you guys are new and I've
never seen my face before make sure you
are subscribed just down below we have
lots of fun here so come and doing the
dinosaur family and give this video a
huge thumbs up for me it helps me out so
much and let's try get the stick into
thirty thousand life I think you guys
can do it also in case you guys don't
know I'm actually hosting a
back-to-school giveaway currently as
well as the MacBook Pro Google 8 I'll
leave the rules all down below as well
as the video where you can see what you
can win in my back-to-school giveaway
and you wanna win a MacBook Pro that the
main goal is to be subscribed to this
channel as well as my vlog Channel Rock
Sora's blogs but without this review
unless you shall praise the video so the
first DIY I'm going to be testing up for
you guys today is the rainbow
highlighter now I've seen this Oliver
internet special YouTube and people are
going crazy about this DIY so I thought
I would test it out for you guys to see
if it actually works so you want to take
your yellow highlighter and hold a blue
highlight to it to make sure that the
ink it seeps into the yellow one and
this is going to create a green color
and then on the other side you want to
place the red highlighter to the yellow
highlighter and this again will make
sure that the two colors merge together
and this will create an orange color
then I love this DIY super super simple
now let's put it to the test and see if
it actually works
I'm actually pleasantly surprised I
didn't think this would actually work as
well as it does but I really really
liked it I definitely would recommend
for you guys to check out this
back-to-school DIY and it does work but
the question is how long will it last
because I'm pretty sure about this one
at some point so the next day is a
really cool one I saw this on Pinterest
and I thought I had to throw this out
for you guys and it's basically using a
potato to create a watermelon design on
your notebook so what you need is a
simple potato you want to cut it in half
and cut it in half again and this should
give you the shape of the watermelon now
what you want to do is basically coat
the slice of potato with red paint and
this is your watermelon stamp once you
have smelled the potato onto the paper
what you want to do is take some green
paint and just basically draw the shell
of the actual watermelon on leave a
little space in between the red and
green that looks more realistic with the
white in between and then once all of
that is dry you can add some seeds by
just sharpening some dots onto the
watermelon I actually love this DIY even
though it didn't come out completely
perfect I really like how this turned
out and I would give it a big thumbs up
so the next DIY is actually one that I
haven't seen much on the Internet I have
just come up with this by myself I try
to find something like this to use as
reference I couldn't find anything like
this on the internet at all so basically
I was inspired by the whole charging
your phone on an apple I've seen this
being tested out in Alicia Marie this
video and basically the whole secret is
that an apple does not charge your phone
because that's literally impossible but
what if it was possible and what you
want for this DIY is some edge right
clay power bag a charging cable and your
iPhone of course
firstly what you want to do is take your
edge right clay and form this into an
apple shape but make sure the inside is
hollow so that you can put your power
back inside it so once you have formed
the shape of your Apple you're in a
place to power back inside and basically
seal all the edges so that you can't
actually see that the power
like is inside it next what you want to
do is paint the whole thing red or green
whatever color of Apple you want to go
for once all of that is done you can add
a fake leaf if you like I'm going to go
ahead and add a fake branch to my Apple
just to have a little fake stem I'm also
going to add a leaf made out of that
material you can use anything for this
if you like you can even use a real leaf
but the fake leaf is of course going to
last much longer so there's the finished
Apple charger I really like how this
turns out actually and I think it's
pretty cool thing to take to school
because people are going to be like wow
you are charging a phone on an apple let
me know what you guys think of this DIY
down below I really wasn't sure I was
going to turn out I actually quite liked
it so the next back-to-school hack that
I'm going to test out for you guys is
the colorful staple tacs
so I've seen this DIY on Pinterest and I
thought I had to test it out to see if
it actually works so apparently what you
want to do is take some nail polish and
basically coat the whole staple rope
before you actually put it in your
stapler obviously make sure you let it
dry and then well you have colorful
circles this has actually worked so I'm
pretty impressed with it and I give it a
thumbs up so the next back-to-school
head is apparently transforming your
regular coloring pencils into
watercolors so supposedly what you do is
you just basically color whatever you
want with your regular pencil and then
take some baby oil on a cotton earbud
and swipe that over the existing pencil
and it's supposed to make your pencil
kind of like bleed and have like a
watercolor effect I mean it kind of
works but I'm not like a hundred percent
convinced you know I thought it would
work much much better I mean it kind of
does the job but it doesn't really get
rid of all the harsh edges it doesn't
completely look like watercolor so I
think I'm going to give this one a
thumbs down and the last back to school
DIY is do my lipstick rubber at the end
of your pencil how cool is that
so what you want to do is take a regular
pencil and pull out the rubber from the
end of it you don't want to take some
sellotape or masking tape and wrap this
around the end of the metal part of the
pencil the next step you want to take is
melt some lipstick and basically pour
this into the end of your pencil so the
third tip is going to basically make
sure that the lipstick is being poured
into the pencil and also is going to
create that shape off the pencil rubber
so once it's dry it's going to basically
in that shape so this is what it looks
like once I unwrapped the actual
sellotape and I actually don't think
this lugs
at all it's really messy as you can see
from my hand
maybe I just did it wrong but I'm giving
this a thumbs down guys I thought one of
you hacks and you I wanted that I'm
going to test for you guys today I
really hope you guys enjoyed this kind
of video I'm trying to do something a
little bit different to my usual hacks
and DIY videos so I hope you guys are
enjoying it if you guys did enjoy this
video please be sure to leave it a huge
thumbs up and make sure you are
subscribed for a chance to win a MacBook
Pro and also we're back to school
