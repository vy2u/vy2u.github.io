hi everyone today I'm gonna be filming a
10 life hack video and if you guys want
to check out any of the other three
videos that I did
I'll have them listed down below in the
description I've noticed that in most of
these videos the hacks that people use
repeat a lot and it's happened in my
videos too I mean there's not like an
infinite amount of hats out there but
regardless I tried to kind of dwell into
the depths of the internet and find the
most not typical kind of life hacks for
you guys so hopefully at least there
will be a few that you guys haven't seen
yet if you guys like this video and
definitely like it and hit the subscribe
button down below and also if you want
to follow me on my social media or the
links will be down below and at the end
of this video as well so that they're
ready let's just jump right into the
video
don't you find it so annoying when you
want to place two balls in the microwave
but they just don't fit well I've got a
hack for you and that is basically to
use a mug and place that in the oven
next to the first Bowl and then you just
want to take your second Bowl and
balance that on top of the mug just make
sure it's really well balanced because
you don't want this falling over inside
your microwave and voila you've got two
bowls in one microwave
this next hack is great for organizing
your underwear and it's basically to put
the bottoms of your matching set into
the cup of your matching bra and this
just made sure that you don't spend
forever trying to find this matching set
of underwear that you want to wear today
super simple but save so much time in
your busy mornings
if you don't have one of those really
long candle lighters you can actually
use a spaghetti to light a really far
away wick and I know it's so difficult
sometimes to reach in there but
basically all you need is a piece of
spaghetti you just want to like the end
and then put that into the candle and
your candle or light up straight away
hack number four is that you can
actually make your own nail polish shade
and all you need is a loose Pigman or
you can crush some eyeshadow and then
you want to add some clear nail polish
to the pigment and then just mix it all
together and just like that you've got a
new nail polish shade if you are a girl
or have long hair then hair groups will
be the bane of your life they will
literally go missing everywhere to
prevent that from happening you can
actually store them in a tic-tac box all
you want to do is just empty out the Tic
Tacs
and then just place them inside you can
take off the label and make a look as
pretty as you like if you want to
achieve a long ponytail you can actually
cheat this by creating two ponytails one
at the top and one just below the top
portion should be a little bit larger
than the bottom just so that it covers
the bottom portion well
pack number seven will make your life so
much easier you know when you can't find
the end of the sellotape and then you
fold it over you have to cut it off
every single time you want to use it
well you can actually just use a
paperclip to put that on the end it
comes off really easily you won't have
to cut anything off and it won't lose
its stickiness if your hanger does this
and your clothing falls off all the time
you can actually just take some rubber
bands and place that on the outer
portions of the hanger this will just
create a grip between the fabric and the
hanger and your clothing will never fall
off again hack number nine is creating
heatless waves with some stockings so
you want to split your hair into two
sections and then you want to tie the
stocking around at your chin level and
then you just want to kind of loop your
hair over the two parts of the stocking
as you can see I'm doing here then you
just want to tie the end to secure it
whilst you waiting for this to kind of
set you can play around with it you can
pretend you're princess layer or that
you're the elephant from Dumbo but I
recommend you just leave them alone and
go to sleep with them and then when you
wake up in the morning you can unravel
them and as you unravel them in the
morning you'll find some really nice
voluminous waves that you wouldn't get
from just a regular braid
hack number 10 is to contour with a
blush some people don't like using
bronzer so a blush is a good alternative
you're on a place the most darker shade
at the bottom into the hollow of your
cheek and then work your way up to the
lightest shade and there you go you've
got a really nice sculpted cheek with
just a blush which looks much more
natural than a bronzer and of my 10
lifehacks i hope you guys enjoyed this
