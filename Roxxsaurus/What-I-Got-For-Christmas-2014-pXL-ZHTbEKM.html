the what I got for Christmas video I
hope you guys like this and just before
we start I would like to include a
disclaimer I'm not trying to brag in any
way I'm really really grateful for
everything that I've got you know I was
very blessed this Christmas with all the
gifts that I received if you're anything
like me then you are very nosy and love
to know what other people got for
Christmas and this is the only purpose
of this video so I hope you guys can
enjoy it and yeah let's just you're
Brennan so the very first present that I
got from my parents was a ring light and
it's for my videos that I'm using it
right now it was a very early Christmas
present and that's because I just really
needed it I found it very difficult to
film in the winter time because I did
get very dark very early and because I
work and have College it made it really
difficult for me to keep up with YouTube
so I just got it a little bit earlier
and it was very very useful the next
thing that I got was also a little bit
of an early present minute my parents
are sort of bad when it comes to
Christmas because we do give each other
some presents quite early so the thing
that I got quite early was the Chanel
nail polish and this is in shade black
pal 5 1-3
I really like this this is my very first
Chanel nail polish and this is a really
gorgeous color it's like a chameleon
metallicky sort of gray turquoise color
and I just really really like it
although I do have to say that the
lasting properties aren't very good and
so you do need to put a top coat over
the Chanel nail polishes the next thing
that I got from my parents or was a MAC
lipstick and my mum knows that I love
MAC Cosmetics and thus lipstick is they
really really gorgeous one and I used
this in my previous video which was the
New Year's Eve makeup and this is a
really nice red sort of brown undertone
lipstick it's matte so it's perfect and
this is in shade Viva Glam
3 me and my mum are bit perfume obsessed
so she knows that I really really like
perfumes so my parents got me the chanel
Coco Mademoiselle perfume this is the
auto parfum so it's more long-lasting
than the order toilette and it looks
like this it's one of my all-time
favorite perfumes it
really does smell gorgeous it really
reminds me of my mum because she always
wears this perfume and yeah I just
really like and it's a really nice um
scent and like I always say you can
never have enough perfumes so they've
got me another one and this left the
Vera Wang perfume I wanted this perfume
for a long long time
I've had a tester of it and I just
really love it it's so sleek it's not
like a perfume that I've ever smoked
before it's like really fresh but sweet
at the same time and fresh and sweet
perfumes on my favourite type so this is
a gorgeous gorgeous scent the next thing
they got me is this baby and it's a
Michael Kors wallet I was so surprised
by this because they did not expect it
at all and it's a gorgeous white leather
wallet slash purse it's got a little
handle but I'd attached that because I
don't really need it and it's got a lot
of compartments so that's great and it's
just the perfect fit for my bag and yeah
I just really like it it looks really
classy the next thing they got me are
two gold rings and slike this and it's
got sort of like a black / purple tone
to it and it's just really really
gorgeous and gold rings are my favorite
and as you guys can tell I'm just
obsessed with gold rings and it's the
only color of jewelry that I wear said
this was perfect in my life and yeah and
the next one that they've got me is this
one here it's got a black stone again
and it's just like a really chunky ring
it's really nice because I don't have to
take it off and when I wash my hands and
that's what I love about gold rings that
you never have to take them off my main
present this year is something I have
been wanting for so so long and it's the
cross the turntable record player and
I've been building a collection of vinyl
since like January and I didn't even
have a record player so they were so
kind to get me one this year and I love
it so much it's a nice sort of like
turquoise color and it goes really well
with my room and to go with the record
player they've got me a vinyl and this
is the Fleetwood Mac rumours album this
album has one of my favourite songs on
it which is dreams and it's just it's
just gorgeous I love this album so much
I know that from now on I'm just going
to spend all of my way
on vinyls my parents also usually get me
something to wear for Christmas and this
year they got me this lovely white
blazer from atmosphere which is Primark
and I've been wanting a white blazer
like this but so long now and this is
just perfect it will go with anything
and I think that this it looks really
classy but it can also be really toned
down and casual and then they also got
me a pair of PJ's I think this pair of
PJ's is from Asda and it's really really
soft and fleecy and I just love it so
much it's so cozy I've just feel like a
teddy bear wearing this and the top also
came with some nice bottoms which are
really like fleecy as well so very warm
for the winter time and it's just so so
cozy one of my cousins came all the way
from London to spend Christmas with us
this year and he also got me a Christmas
present and he got me the intimately
Beckham perfume and body silk lotion
which was really nice of them and I love
the scent of this it's also very sweet
and as you guys know by now I just love
sweet things and perfumes and all that
so I love it now moving on to gifts from
my boyfriend the first thing that he got
me was this perfumes by Juicy Couture
and I love it so much the bottle kind of
reminds me of the church I don't know is
that just me but yeah the Sun is really
sweet which he obviously must have
remembered that I liked so boyfriend
points to him I recently got my
provisional license to start driving
lessons and he got me the driving test
DVD and book to start learning the
theory which is really nice of him and
it's really really useful because if I
didn't get this from him I probably
wouldn't go out to get it any time soon
because it's something that I'm really
putting off but yeah this is dumb really
helpful and I I'm gonna start learning
now wish me luck guys I got me this cute
little card it's like nice and soft and
velvety it's a really nice card that is
he then got me a cannon a remote
controller which is like a little clicky
thing for than my camera and it means I
can take photos when I'm quite far away
from the camera and I don't have to set
it on timer
which is really really useful for like
fashion photos and videos I suppose so
yeah that's really really useful again
me my boyfriend had this thing that we
always like some candles when he's over
because we don't really like having the
main light on so we always have
difficulty trying to light the candles
because my my lighter is really bad so
he got me this lighter which looks like
a weapon in a way I could probably carry
this in my bag and scare some people but
look at this guy's
that is the lethal that they can burn
someone pretty bad and the main present
for my boyfriend was a Polaroid camera
and I'm so so so excited about this
it's a instant digital camera it's it
looks like this so it's basically shaped
like an old you know an old retro sort
of a Polaroid camera this just straight
web prints a photo so you don't have to
wait for it to develop or anything which
is really helpful and he also got me
some paper to go with that and I've been
printing some lovely photos when we went
to the Isle of Wight over Christmas time
and I just love the fact that you can
have a hard copy of captured moments and
it's just a really nice thing to have
because nowadays we always take photos
on our iPhones and just upload it on
Instagram or we never actually have a
hard copy of these photos in these
moments that we want to remember so it's
never sort of definitely that you always
have these photos but when they're
printed like this you are less likely to
lose them or delete them by mistake I
think I'm going to make a cute little
album of this because it's just a nice
way to keep all of the photos together
and then my boyfriend's one was also
kind to get me something and she got me
this and I was so excited about it
because I love sweets and you know I've
got a really bad sweet tooth so this
will definitely definitely satisfy that
and she also got me some gift vouchers
for this cute little vintage shop but I
don't have them with me at the moment
and I can't be booked to get them but
yeah that was really nice of her
and his dad also got me something which
was also really nice of him
and he got me a vintage sewing machine
which is so so beautiful and they just
all know that I love antiques so that
was really thoughtful of him
and I will put that somewhere in my room
and it's just gonna look amazing so that
is all for my video I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I hope you had a lovely
Christmas and a great start of 2015 and
I am so excited to share my year with
you guys because I'm really nosy I would
like you guys to comment three things
that you got for Christmas and pop them
down in the comments and we can get a
little conversation going maybe and yeah
I'd like to read what you guys got so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you my next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
