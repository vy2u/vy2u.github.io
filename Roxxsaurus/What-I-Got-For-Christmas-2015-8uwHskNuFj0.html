at the what I got for Christmas video I
personally love seeing what people get
for Christmas because I'm not really a
nosy person but if this isn't your type
of video then you can click off and just
watch another video of mine and before I
start I'm going to make one of these
disclaimers that literally everyone does
that makes this video and that is that
basically this video was requested by a
few of you so I thought I would just
film it I really like watching these
videos personally so I thought you guys
might be as nosy as me and want to know
what I got for Christmas so hope you
guys enjoyed this video and don't take
it as like too seriously or bragging or
anything it's just a little bit of fun
and I'm also curious to see what you
guys got for Christmas so just let me
know in the comments below so I think
I'm going to get started now I'm gonna
get started with what I got from my
parents so the first few little bits are
actually things that I actually asked
for and I really wanted to try out and
that's some of the Mac product so the
first thing that they got me is the
Studio Fix fluid Mac Foundation and I'm
so excited to try this out because I've
never actually tried this Mac foundation
out then it also got me the day gleam
pressed pigment and this is like an eye
shadow or it can be as a highlighter as
well I'm pretty sure and it's just this
really gorgeous shimmering gold kind of
color and then the last Mac product I
received is the Mac Studio Fix which I
got a little bit early which is a little
bit naughty I actually this in my
previous video so yeah I got this little
bit early because my mom just couldn't
wait any longer and I really needed a
new powder so she just gave it to me
early the next thing I also wanted was
these the Weaver brushes and this comes
in a little cute like rose gold set and
this has I'm not going to go through all
the names but look how gorgeous these
brushes are they're like rose gold and
really like like baby pink and they are
just my life basically I'm so excited to
start using these for my tutorials so
definitely expect these a lot in my
future tutorials the next thing that my
parents got me is the Apple pencil
and this actually goes with my iPad pro

owned I just love it so much the next
thing that they got me is this wire cell
or each save their own gift set it comes
with the makeup remover eyeliner
concealer and mascara which is really
cool and it also has like this cool
makeup pouch which is really handy
because you never have enough makeup
bags do the next thing that my parents
