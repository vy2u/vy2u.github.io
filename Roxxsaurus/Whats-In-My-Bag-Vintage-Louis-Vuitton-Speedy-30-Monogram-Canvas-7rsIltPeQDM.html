what's in my bag video you guys seem to
really like the idea of me filming this
so let's just jump right in so first
things first my bag is this one for now
and it's the loot on speedy 30 monogram
canvas this one is actually my mum's
it's a vintage like genuine one she got
this on eBay and she kind of like lets
me borrow her bags sometimes because we
share our bags so this is more more her
bag but I steal it sometimes so
basically it's this lovely vintage bag I
really really like it it's very much my
style and let's just jump right in and
I'll show you what I've got in this baby
so this bag is going to be a tip and a
mess because I haven't sort out through
it but yes so the first thing I see is
this empty water bottle because you know
got to stay hydrated uh-huh then next is
a book this is the book that I'm
currently reading on and off if I have a
spare bit of time and this is the moth
Diaries by Rachel Klein I really like
this book I've seen the movie so so many
times and it's just like one of my
favorite books and movies so I really
recommend you guys to watch it or read
it the next thing that I see is a tangle
teezer of course tangle teezer that are
like my life Savior when you have long
hair and very tangle prone hair
especially the tangle teezer is just a
life Savior because it really really
gets rid of the tangles doesn't make
your head hurt and doesn't pull out your
hair doesn't call breakage of the hair
so I really recommend you guys to try
this out if you haven't already and this
is the travel sized one it's quite small
and it's got a little cap so you can um
so the bristles don't break when you've
got in your bag so I really really like
that the next thing that I have in here
is a wallet and this one is like just
the matching one to the bag if you can
see it's the same print and I just keep
my cards and now
normal person and what outstrip happen
here a maintenant card a Tesco Clubcard
some change
and I actually Oh what else what is this
some of the cards um I actually keep
photos in my purse I'm not too sure if
that's a weird thing to do or if
actually people do that but I'm just
going to show you a few exclusive photos
from my childhood which are really
embarrassing that's me and my mum when I
was about nine years old I'm looking
like a right diva in my little space
bikini
it looks like I'm an alien honestly this
was my bus pass photo and it's awful
look at my fringe like that's that's
ridiculous I was about 12 there maybe I
was in year 8 here and I was quite
chubby I think I've changed quite a bit
um for anyone who was asking this is my
natural hair color so it's quite like a
dark brown I hope you're not terrified
that was me as a kid so that's that the
next thing that I see is a scrunchie
this is from boots I just really like
scrunchies because you can so easily put
your hair up just get it out of your
face and then I have a dry shampoo this
is by girls only and this is the one
like from super drive I think you can
also get it in tes Cotes I believe the
next thing I see is a receipt from the
supermarket random then I have my work
badge for those of you who didn't know I
work at TK Maxx as a recent so there's
my little badge then I have some
headphones from Apple these are like the
ones that come with an iPhone and yeah I
don't go anywhere without headphones
because I just cannot stand not
listening to music when I'm like on the
bus or walking somewhere guilty as
charged
Darry fudge gotta satisfy that sweet
tooth you know then I have a sunglass
case from Ted Baker with some sunglasses
inside it this is from like more of
summertime and still haven't taken them
out of my bag bees on Ted Baker but
these are just the ones that I kept in
there because I really like them the
like the cat eye shape then I have
probably the most exciting part of this
video which is my makeup bag and this is
the one that I showed you in my previous
video it's the DKNY one I really really
like this because it's really spacious
and this is all the stuff that I keep in
there so I'll just quickly go through
what I keep in my makeup bag for you
guys the first thing that I see our two
hand creams the first one is from OPI
and this is in winter huckleberry I
really like this one then then I have
one from Marks and Spencers just a
random hand cream there is never too
much hand creams the next thing that I
have is a sleek blush I really like this
one because it's like so tiny and
compact and it's this lovely like red
undertone shade this isn't shade flash
9:35 really love this one
then I have another blush which is Mac
in dainty I really like this one because
it also act as a highlighter so you can
just use it um for multi-purpose and
then the last blush that I have is by
this gallon and this is like in this
really nice peachy shade then I have a
powder by benefit this is the powder
flage and a face brush next is the
benefit Dallas bronzer this is like one
of my favorite bronzers and I love it I
just keep that in my makeup bag at all
times pretty much then I have this
really nice compact palette and it's a
really nice one because it's so tiny so
it literally just fits right in there
and it has a look it has a variety of
like neutral shades so really like that
and this is by NYX in love in Paris and
the actual pilot is called Parisian chic
so I really really like this and I think
it's really cute it's got like a tiny
little bow here I only have a few things
here left I have a little fluffy brush
like
lending brush to blend out any shadows
and then I have two lip glosses the
first one is by Bobbi Brown and the next
one is by Illamasqua and these are like
new shades I really like them too and
the last thing is an ST Lord of lipstick
I really really like the packaging of
this is like so luxurious and gold and
lipstick is really nice because it's
like a really neutral shade it's like
your lips but better so that's all for
my makeup bag the next thing is a
perfume this is Prada candy I really
really like this perfume it's really
sweet and keep that in there at all
times because it's one of those perfumes
that I don't really use often but if I
put it in my bag I know I will use it
then I have some gum bye pulse 5 I think
it's called then I have a little
notebook I really like having a notebook
at all times with me and pens two of
them in case one runs out of course you
have to be prepared for these things you
know so I have this one I think I got
this from like Poundland it's really
really cheap but I like to make a lot of
notes so I keep that in there all times
and then I have like this little pocket
section and I'll just keep like a few
bits and bobs in there first thing that
I see is this mirror by spiral ski I
think that's how say elements looks like
this it's really really pretty it's like
a nice lilac color and I really love the
mirror because it's got like three parts
or one is like a really magnifying one
that one and then like a normal one so I
really really like it and it's really
quite compact and I know it won't break
another hand cream you can never have
enough hand cream so this one is from
OPI again and it's in coconut melon next
thing is a memory stick I really really
love this it's so cute it's like a
Rilakkuma memory stick it used to have a
body as well that you kind of covered
the memory stick bit but I lost the body
unfortunately I got this on eBay for
like 20 pounds and it's a 32 gigabyte
one so that's really really good and two
Burberry body kind of like testers I
really like having tester perfumes in
case I don't have a big perfume with me
and I just think that they are quite
easy and just handy to have and the last
thing that I have is this
and it's in my pocket because I'm
meaning to get it fixed it's supposed to
go on the little zipper here right here
and it broke off so um I'm gonna have to
go to the Louvre town store to get it
fixed Millie I hope they will do that
for me
if not then oh well and that is all for
my what's in my bag video I hope you
guys enjoyed this as always if you have
any suggestions pop them down below if
you enjoyed this video give it a big
thumbs up that will help me out a lot
and yeah hope you guys enjoyed this and
I'll see my next one bye it's as you can
see this lovely kind of tennis style
skirt it's really really pretty and
white but there is a lot of different
colors to choose from I chose white
because I'm really into white Lee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
