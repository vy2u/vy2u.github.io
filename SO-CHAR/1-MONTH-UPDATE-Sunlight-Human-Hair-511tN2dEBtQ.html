today I'm going to be doing my one month
update on this curly hair that I
received from sunlight hair company so I
am wearing a a deep boy's hair but to
meet this hair it's kind of more like Oh
kinky curly to me but it is an 8 8 deep
wave hair and it is Brazilian hair my
bundles that I learned is a 20 the 24
and a 22 and my lace frontal is a 20
inch lace funnel so this is my one month
update so what I'll probably say that
this hair does shed it it has some
shading to it it doesn't but when I prep
it I have a video I'll link it down
below on how life I prep my curly hair
and stuff like that my 20 hair routine I
think we just sprayed now run my fingers
through it and that's kind of what I do
want probably spread a little bit of
conditioner or whatnot in it so that
fits what I do and whatever my fingers
do it'll probably come through my
fingers like comb in order - shedding
but throughout the day I can walk around
with it and emotion crazy or nothing
like that to me the hair is it is a 24
inch to 24th and a 20 and 20 into a
rental so the hair is pretty big to me
it's pretty fluffy is pretty big it's
like it's wrong but it's kind of like a
nice long it's like to my if I stretch
it'll probably come down to my hips but
it is not stress it comes out and
probably like the middle of my back area
so I did reach the knot on the first run
- and I do have a video on how I did
that for the different so I also have
that link down the description box so
far right
all right some hair in my mouth all
right all right so all I did today was I
washed it last night and I ran out of
conditioner so this is based off of like
minimal conditioner and I let it air dry
and this is kind of like natural state
basically I just put a little bit of
water in my fingers and I just kind of
ran through it
no it's loving how it looks right now
with its neck and pearls and all that so
I just ran my fingers through and this
was the look that I got you know my
system may be here though
simple simple but I just definitely say
that this hair I do highly recommend it
it is very pretty very soft when I wear
this wig I've been wearing this wig and
also my 360 lace frontals from Oscar
hair and these two like this with I mean
like literally I can just Pat take this
off lay down on the couch throw it on in
like when you rent some crow soda it'll
be ready to go like I don't prune your
head like a highly maintenance you guys
do as you guys do that no you need to
put some water and run your hands
through and walk out the house like that
all that's really to the pair so I would
definitely recommend this hair and I
really don't have no issues with the
hair the frontal blimp in with the air
perfectly fine like I don't really see
anything about the terrible side effect
that induction when you run your fingers
through it but besides that this hair is
super long and it is my one last update
I probably thrown this way
on over ten times one in the month so I
can always say honestly say I'm going to
be rockledge wait I wanted to sell it I
did I don't know if I'm going to but if
I do I'll probably leave I brought you
guys a wig show with not unusual in it
but I'm loving this hair so much I don't
know if I would let it go just yet so
yeah this is not one but update I'll
probably come back in a few more months
and let you guys know that de terre is
still popping and also you guys were
wondering about my lashes because I do
always get comments on my lashes I wear
became inks it is a main company by a
young lady very beautiful nice and way
she has her own company sets the stage
on age and I also have a promo copy guys
it's called my promo code name is you
love char I am wearing the silent n and
these are what they look like I'm
actually going to upload a video and
paint detail on how to apply these so
that would be in the description box
below but I do have a promo code return
and you love char and the lashes are
about $20 and shipping is about this -
OH
but if you put in my chroma card you
will get a discount and my promo number
is limited of our own name is limited so
it'll probably up to a week or down so
oh you're so so if I were you guys I
would harrogate and pick you guys up a
parent before myself is always first and
yeah so I also make down a detail video

everything so that's all the thing I've
out and I also have her website and
