today I'm gonna be doing a video and
this video is basically going to be like
a beauty on a budget type of video it is
a hair of you and it is on this way that
I do have on and um I just really kind
of got into doing wigs and wearing wigs
so I'm not really sure if I applied it
well but if you're interested in this
video and you want to know more about
this hair keep on watching ok guys so
the way that I'm wearing is actually
from like an online beauty supply store
called glamour Tris so what I'm wearing
right now is a free trous equal
synthetic premium deluxe lace front wig
and it's called Evelyn and the color
I got it in is TS nude I don't know if
you guys have seen umm I actually got
this I got this idea from army Barbie
I'm subscribed to her and I seen that
she posted this video and she kind of
did like a little review on it and I was
loving it on her something like this
week was only thirty dollars so I was
like I'm definitely gonna try it out
like I'm gonna buy this way like it
looks so good on her it was so pretty so
I definitely told myself well you know
what I'm going to try this wig out and
it's only $30 so let's see how this goes
and I'll definitely do review on you
guys cuz one thing for sure about me is
like I'm really really cheap and I'm
like I'm all for affordable hair so I
ordered the hair probably on I think I
ordered it on Thursday I definitely
ordered the hair on Thursday and it came
to me on Tuesday
this is my mom she's gonna hurt the link
I ordered this hair and he came on
Tuesday so this is the box that it came
in and he had it like nicely packaged
I'll open and show you the one the box
and it was like in the hair like this
and all that oh the peace camp they also
come in like some pizza it also comes in
like some really really really pretty
colors like this rose gold I'm thinking
to order one of these next and then
these two ones but I got the Evelyn TS
nude only thing I'm really confused
about on this hair is like what length
it is because like it out said it comes
down to like right underneath my boob so
like like I can't really show you but it
comes like to right underneath my boob
and it's not read at home
um I kind of like put it the frit I put
it on like I don't know if it looks good
or not I think it looks straight to me
like I pulled out something in front of
my hair and it also did come with like
the lace around it I'll show you a
picture I post a picture right here of
how it looked in the box and stuff like
that I didn't get a chance to take a
picture of the lace before I cut the
trim of the lace only thing I do regret
is um I should have pressed it down a
little bit at the top and I should have
did my braids way smaller than what they
are
besides that like as you can see it's
like it's a synthetic wig you know you
can't really ask for too much from a
synthetic wig but the hair doesn't
really it doesn't shed like it doesn't
shed it just feels like kind of thick I
was kind of scared to flatten it so I
didn't but like it's pretty straight I
don't think I'll probably I'll probably
wear this hair a couple times like I'm
not gonna wear it I'll probably wear out
once in a blue moon or so cuz you know
you can't wear this hair every day and
go to sleep with it on like it's going
to give Raggedy cuz it's synthetic it
was only thirty dollars but I think for
thirty dollars this is like a damn good
wig and it looks it looks really pretty
like I'm loving the look that I got with
this look so this is the hair and this
is the ball oh he has some more pictures
of the other wigs that we have on the
back of the box
yes mom
mommy the stock normal no it looks nice
it looks perfectly nice it's close I'll
send you another picture no no no no
it's not that it yes anyway so yeah so

store link and I'll link down the wig
