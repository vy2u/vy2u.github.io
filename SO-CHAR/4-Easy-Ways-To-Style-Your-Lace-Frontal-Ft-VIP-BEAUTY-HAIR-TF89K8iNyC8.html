today I'm going to show you four
different ways that you can style your
lace frontal so if you're interested in
my 4 different ways then keep watching
ok so the first one that I'm gonna show
you is the top knot button so this side
already has like a part and if you see
me being gentle with the hair I just
don't want to mess up the curls on it so
you can just do it like this um if you
want you can use a hair tie I usually
don't use a hair tie but I also tend to
like to grab some hair from the back so
like this grab me some hair from back
here
and I'd like to go like that and
basically told them right here so
without using a scrunchie you can just
twist it like this kind of basically so
this can be one way to where your knees
from well the next hairstyle is very
similar to the top not bun but I would
call me like a half down half up still
from that same part that was
just wanna remind you guys that this is
not glued down so it will move it down
and then I can just spread it apart like
that and that's kind of like my like a
little girl
so the next style will be me doing two
of those at all top not sauce it's gonna
be kind of difficult because I really
haven't since I've gotten this hair I
don't think I'm like ever ever split it
in half so it is gonna be
hmm all right so I know it's crazy but
I'm just like
okay so now the last style is going to
be a simple up two kind of fun before I
do this let me explain to you guys that
this is a lace of frontal wig that I
made so this hat is a frontal and the
back half is just glued on to a dome cap
so with that being said I am able to put
it into the top nut without my tracks
showing so let's get into this okay so I
hope I can do this but this is what I
basically do now this frontal isn't
glued so my flat like my side flaps
might might might might flip up
okay see what I mean when I see my flips
I'll live it up but it ain't nothing to
this you know I just like it's really
tight so I just stick it on so I'm kind
of like I really do recommend
I don't know yeah so this was the last
tutorial and which is my top button and
let me know what you guys think let me
know if you liked the video comment down
below more things you want to see me do
if you want I've been trying to work on
doing my makeup tutorials but I'm
waiting to get more lighting and a
better camera because the other camera I
have it keeps doing this thing where
it's shutters and it's trying to
autofocus and I just can't do it
it does that mystically when I'm doing a
lot of movement so I can't be all over
my face and I should gonna keep blurring
in right now so be patience it's coming
and also I do have hair reviews coming
so I will let you know on that and
that's all for today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
