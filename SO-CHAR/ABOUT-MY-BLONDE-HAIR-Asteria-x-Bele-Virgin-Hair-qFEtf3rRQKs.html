hi guys welcome back to my channel so I
know it's been a while but I was having
some difficulties but I'm now back and
I'm going to be doing equal deals so I
have so much hair to review its install
it's great ways is just really
overwhelming right now but this video is
going to be about this blonde hair I'm
not sure if you guys watched my last
video it's not I called an applause but
it's kind of like a little snippet kind
of law if I could direct about one
minute ago and I was I went helicopter
eyes from us for the first time it was
birthday gifts and so yeah in that video
is this hair that I'm wearing in case
you guys were wondering so this is the
hair I'm actually mixing hair companies
with this hair the frontal that I'm
wearing is from Bell version hair and it
isn't 16 inch frontal and the bundles
that I'm wearing is from Austria hair
this is a boss I did the unboxing for
them I did not do an unboxing for the
Bell hair but I will be coming out with
a weight for that specifically I'm going
to take this one apart even though I
really today it looks so this hair came
in its natural 1b color so did the
frontal and I'm going to be more money
with you guys
bleaching this hair was like hell like
it was so so so hard like to get it to
be this light like to get it to be this
like I had like struggles like I know I
was I knew I watched some YouTube videos
and what I did was I believed it once in
our lessons like an hour in 60 minutes
and it got to like a nice little
brownish color but it wasn't this color
that I wanted so I let it sit longer and
I just can't take
time to take your time like okay well
now I added another 30 minutes I had
another 40 minutes
I used um VW developer and i GW powder
and I used the clara sold 40 developer
and let it fit to the point where i
started fishing my hair like six and a
bike ten twelve ten to twelve yes it was
original work so i was like what the why
is it not getting lighter so i ended up
looking a video and I found a specific
video where she asked me wash the hair
out let it dry in the next day place it
again so that's what I ended up doing
and it really was a headache like I
started bleaching my hair on Monday and
I probably got it to what I wanted it to
look like by Thursday I bleached the
hair everyday on like bundles poblanos
and stuff like that so I would say that
the best thing for you to do is maybe
bleach the hair for a couple hours and
then wash it off and then release it
again because that's the only way it'll
get this line it won't get this light in
one three session and for the front door
like kind of see how I got like the dark
roots type of thing going let me tell
y'all I had to like I parted in a veggie
like I'm part of each part and I put
like a little for you right here so like
bleach will get on the back part and I
just have to do it like one by one and
one by one one by one and then I have to
bleach it again the second time to get
it to get dislike so um the hair I would
say the hair looks it's really soft it's
not it doesn't tangle it doesn't not but
it is really what can I say like it's
really enriches been bleached like it's
been like I bleached it out of this hair
but it doesn't oh and yeah
my frontal oh my god the camera catches
is so well my frontal is like really
light compared I didn't leave it long
enough so compared to some of the hair
my front so really does
dammit don't stand out like in person it
looks good the family I'm holding up the
hair like I could clearly see the
frontal and then so I'm wearing for the
bundle that I'm wearing I'm wearing a 16
or 14 I'm sorry what I think I'm wearing
a 24 and a 22 they did send me three
bundles but the frontal plus the 24 to
20 to fit in perfect for me it's I think
it's pretty good it's a full amount it
don't look thin or nothing like that so
I did have an extra bundle of hair after
the front so it came with other bundles
or whatnot that would be a whole nother
video what I do change I'm going to
change it I'm thinking of doing a bob
because I did get short hair from Belle
version there and so I'm thinking of
probably doing maybe like a cute fall
like a pink one like a pastel pink or
something like that maybe great I'm not
too sure yet but so far I've been
actually this is like the hair this one
got really known world is hair everyday
like I usually like to switch out my
ways like today I'll be gone tomorrow
I'll be black next day I'll be straight
maybe i'll be curly like but I actually
really love this hair and I have been
rocking it two-fifty so so far I'm going
to go ahead and get Austria hair a
thumbs up because this hair went through
it with the bleach and even though it
went through with the bleach is still
nice it doesn't tangle barely shed I
don't think it really air ever shared
likes nothing hair out yeah it doesn't
really shed so definitely definitely
would recommended hair and it is very
affordable so I will be doing more
videos coming up I will be doing more
hair videos today and oh one more today
and more videos coming up and I will
start packing up on the makeup videos I
did get some comments about doing an
eyebrow tutorial I mean if you all like
my brows I got I think my time on my
brows but I mean like they're never the
same and you know eyebrows or suits
they're not tuned into scissors whatever
but you know I feel like this eyebrow go
higher than the other but
just comment down below everything you
guys want to see more things whatever
you want to see me do makeup look
whatever it really is just comment down
below and let me know some ideas for me
