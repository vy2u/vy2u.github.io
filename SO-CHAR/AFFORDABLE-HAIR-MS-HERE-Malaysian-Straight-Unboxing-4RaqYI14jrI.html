my channel so today's video is going to
be kind of like an unboxing type of
video maybe my initial review on this
hand that I received from the VIP Beauty
here um I have done business with VIP
Beauty here a couple times already know
and I would say overall they are pretty
great company so yeah I'm going to go
ahead and get into it if you guys have
any questions about I don't know why I
might not be getting water is that have
any questions about this hair that I'm
wearing
I will definitely leave the link down
below so first thing I'm going to show
you guys is the frontal um so I've
already bleached the frontal I'll just
bring it in hopefully see I had already
greased it in did some plucking on it so
it has that kind of natural look to it
yes this is the frontal I did such a lot
of the hairs at the front part the hair
line of the frontal is pretty natural
it didn't look like I didn't wash or
anything like that but you know you is a
compromise between your lightning so
this is stuff frontal hosting and this
is a 20 inch special boy I have I have
some hair that water review I probably
given week up some xx simple and I'm not
all night it is so much better with your
press if you're wearing long hair if
your front row is longer like for
example this is a 16 inch frontal in
like you can kind of see the difference
with the long weeds but when you put a
20 inch frontal with some long but it
was like I can always show you guys when
I'm 18
perfect so yeah this is going to be a
perfect way cameras increasing so the
hair team now I get to second something
but everybody's hair is coming packaging
like this and it's just I love that they
put it in a pink bag I love pink but yes
they sent me a slave Jake's at 24 or 22
and a 28 runs over um I think what are
the best thing for me to go out and show
you guys the 26 and I'll show you the 20
and kind of compare those two because
you know that's my longest one and minor
one take your time stroll up think about
the wrath need necessarily just a nice
catches my toes nothing about ordinary
you know
excuse me Howard from Paris I like when
it's action-packed individually instead
of out and open and be infringing all
right so this is the balloon and
it's really soft like it really soft it
does have a committed couple life has
been anticipated a strong consensus
I would say that it is number three the
West and all that is pretty nice it is
pretty big for 26 inch Oh little things
that you know once you open it up
returns and something else in or pretty
nice they look like they don't look
chalk straight across like I haven't
people send me here while when I get
hair and like done blood cut the ends of
my 26 is like what you doing so the ends
of phrases and if you can see it's kind
of like a natural one beam it doesn't
look died or anything is actually like a
natural color so that was the 26 now
that's all they show you the 21 days 26
minutes
so here's the funniest bundle and I'm
going to save me malice in this big like
it was like I'm gonna compare them to be
it goes same mm-hm
Aliexpress here it definitely smells
like Ellie critter yes it does it's not
the to think so but that corn chips not
like you know like some Doritos without
no flavor yeah so this ends the ends on
this one does look a little cut it kind
of looks to me more present to us with
more cuts in the cornices but the hair
is really salty to see is built and
flowy
nice and I'm going to compare the
bundles now
so clearly this one is the 26 and this
one is 20 so the plenty is definitely
bigger in bond wise definitely thicker
as you can see but they both have that
nice luster and they both just released
go with the flow so definitely
definitely looking for thinking we gotta
say I actually seen a video I'm going to
take I'm just enough time to talk
surprised with what I can execute is
here I actually seen another youtuber
her name is pretty cool than her cousin
yes she turned some black hair that she
had seen like a burgundy color and she
did it without using anything so to use
the high color L'Oreal thing so I'm
gonna go and purchase that and I'm
definitely going to do that to this
bundle and I'm definitely going to get
it chop it like this I'm so excited to
make this wake because like I know like
I would me like a good handful of
desktop wigs and now that I've already
did my like trial and error type of
thing on them like I know what my
mistakes are I know what to avoid
what not do and how to make a perfect
way so I know for sure I'm going to bomb
this way and the video on this head will
most likely 100% be up by next week so
go ahead and stay tuned for that video
