go on off can understand hi guys welcome
back to my channel so today i'm going to
be doing this install video you guys and
this is hair from austria hair company
okay so this is my second time doing
business with this company and i can
actually say that their hair is open
here the first time i had here from them
a straight here and again i got straight
hair so let me tell you a little bit
about this here now this is a 350 front
tool and I made it into a way myself so
they sent me a 3/5 a frontal in if I'm
not really starts up so they sent me in
a 350 crumpled and inches I'm not sure
if it's 20 or 22
but the 360 frontal is Chrissy proceeded
long I did please the not I did record a
video on the bleaching the nos however I
did start to record the video me making
the way but I didn't really like how it
was coming out and it's my first time
making the 360 link so I stopped filming
it but if you guys want to see me a
bleach they're definitely comment down
below and I'll definitely edit it in
uploaded for you guys so that's without
saying this is a 360 trunzo and if you
don't know a 350 pretzel it's just like
a lace frontals but it goes all around
in the middle part is empty so I'm
wearing at 350 I don't have my earrings
sorry all but I couldn't find my other
hoops so no hearings and it's message of
elementary so with that being said this
is a 20 or 22 inch lace front so I'll
definitely have in common
down below here let me show you guys
like a piece of the frontal this is
frontal right here so you can see how
long it is and even like let me pull up
peeps on the bed and this is it from the
back as well it's pretty long so it
might just be a 22 whatever it is I'll
definitely correct myself have it down
below and what that means that I am
wearing only two bundles and it is a 26
and 24 inch I was able to fit all my two
bundles so this is a 350 frontal with
only two bubbles and here let me split
it is so copy good like it's so full
like I don't think I've ever had this
much hair like on my head like it's so
cool and watch the frontal and I believe
the front if I didn't watch the bundles
so right now the puzzles are just
straight how they are they're not laws
condition or nothing I think it is
absolutely beautiful it's most of my
other videos you could probably hear me
complaining about how the ends don't get
all the way straight and there's lot of
split ends and this leave there is
pittance but is not being compared to
the other hands it up and having so yeah
so far I'm going to give this hair a
thumbs up I'll probably be back within
the next two weeks to let you know how
it's doing and how to take some curls
and things like that
so that is all for today if you guys
want to see a video on how I started
like this comment down below and let me
know I know I was going to do one for
the Bernese but I didn't do it so I'll
definitely probably do it for this one
if you guys want to see it it's comment
down below and I doesn't do it I'll be
back soon to let you know if it's worth
it or not thank you guys for watching
subscribe below and guys
to hit 3000 so if you focus on me okay
I'm thinking 3000 subscribe I was so
happy like John justice movement smells
and smooth fast but I'm just grateful
for it all ah that's all for today guys
