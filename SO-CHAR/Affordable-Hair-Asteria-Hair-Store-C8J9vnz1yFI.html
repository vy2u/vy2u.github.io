today I have a hair review for you guys
and it's on Aliexpress Austria hair this
child was actually sent to me by Austria
hair and I got it in a normal DHL box
nothing spectacular but it did come in a
digital bag and then in within these
lovely box and it also came with some
eyelashes thank you also some a headband
and it says like homemade
hand me your tie and it also came with a
cute little headband opponent now this
bow is super cute but I think I'll be
innovative and then the hair came okay
so the hair comes packaged like this
it's smells normal not too much it has
this little thing that says Austrian
hair and this is bundles i'd say that
the bundles so far the ends to look a
little clip but it is thick all the way
down to the bottom this is my longest
bundle which is a 24 to much to it they
all
this is the 20 oh you know what they
needed a sake they actually were
supposed to send me to 20 tubes I mean a
22 or 24 a 20 or 2224 but they ended up
sending me to 22 and these are the ends
anyways so altogether these are them as
you can see the 24 one is the middle but
they are thick from it's not steady but
it's super thick for three fun
in living yo my elbows are ashy
so these are my three bundles I'm not
too sure when I'm gonna install it but
the shipping was very fast from when he
told me he was gonna ship me out before
she told me she was gonna shoot me up in
here it came in less than three days so
so far it doesn't have a harsh smell but
the bundles are really soft and they're
like super it so can't wait to try this
pair oh I'll probably have it installed
at least a week this is you know I
probably make a wig out of it and see
where it goes from there but that is all
for this 15 and also this is my VIP
I got told you that before the frontier
SuperDrive
my finals like I'm not even gonna try to
comb through this crap my final update
on this hair will be coming up soon
anyways stop well that's office
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
