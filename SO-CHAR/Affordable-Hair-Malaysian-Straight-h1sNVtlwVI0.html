going to be doing my two week update on
this hair which is from miss her hair on
Aliexpress I'm wearing relation straight
which is with a 20 inch frontal and I'm
wearing inches 26:24 in 22 so I'm going
to spot that a little bit but you don't
completely see my little important so
I've been wearing this hair in about it
and I'll forget the past two weeks now
and so far but I thought I was going on
micro interview but now I'm back to the
stringer face so I'm really really for
this look so if you guys are interested

to keep this look will dis the color in
the heads up if you guys want to see how
I style it increases or they comment
down below and I'll set them experience
so first thing I'll say about this hair
and it'll probably and the end to me the
in so get that straight
I feel like the ends have a lot of split
ends in the hair so to me that's like
and press the hair down there's a lotta
little hairs and I'm pretty taking
effect upon so to me I hate that it
don't get straight but besides that
there it super sauce is really tangled
on my always flyer is when I wear it
just because you know I like my hair to
be super super straight I can always
just take it off lit and way around
but already best miners be super crystal
and super straight that is how I met my
hair and actually I was sent from them I
was sent for bundles and was crazy
inside entity ended up only using two
bundles and a pencil so I would say that
the West on here on big in really nice
so so far I already have anything bad to
say about the hair
besides the fact that that is do not
fully straighten or they do different
shapeless it looks a little frizzy
because there are lovely but thought
that I am loving too scared and if you
guys want to see videos August on right
there between coming down below and
doesn't lead to two different style to
you and also I want to edit that I as
right now I do not make Leslie Lake
possibly pursue and is not custom my I
am I feel like I could be anyone else
ability hood I also like I'm really that
good yet so I'm still sensing oh my
so my engine season my old videos my
pencils are currently better but I'm not
ready to do anyone elses or you know
this is sudden money that might be
wasting with it so I'm not ready yet to
be doing for tools and something that
