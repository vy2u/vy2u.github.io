today I have a video for guys and this
is gonna be on my Aliexpress VIP hair
string in my face okay on my I've
expressed VIP hair and it is going to be
a frontal this is my first frontal and
my first frontal video and I ordered the
inches twenty twenty eight twenty inch
frontal a 22 a 24 and a twenty six so
I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys the
hair I haven't even opened it yet it's
still wrapped in a bow okay this string
is like just pull it up okay I haven't
opened the hair so it's basically gonna
be also like an unboxing this is my
first time opening I haven't co wash it
or anything so if you're interested in
the hair keep watching and also if
you're interested in this hair that I do
have on I'll have the video link below
to this hair bye oh continue watching
okay guys so I realized that I made a
mistake
um this is actually an 18 inch frontal
but the inches I did say was right was
22 24 and 26 and this is all from VIP
Beauty here on Aliexpress so in total I
paid one hundred and forty three dollars
for all of this so I ordered the hair
let me see let me double check
I just messaged to find it
um the seller meandher wrote back and
fell back and forth a few times she was
very very nice and she really kept me
updated on everything like when she
shipped out the hair and all that type
of stuff
so I actually ordered the hair on the
8th and I received it I ordered the hair
on Saturday and I actually received it
right on Wednesday so just about I'd say
about 3 or 4 days it's how long the hair
actually took to come and this is the
air right here haven't opened it yet so
this is kind of like a nun
this is actually basically an unboxing
it came in to normal FedEx box it came
early in the morning like these people
woke me up on my sleep but I might put
his hair so I got a so it comes in this
little this little pouch like this and
of course they sent me some free
eyelashes these are the eyelashes they
actually send it's an individual it's
really cool I want to show you guys the
frontal faces I'm really really excited
about it you know like popular right now
I'm just gonna take everything off the
ball no bagging and they also sent just
this little thing from VIP SS thanks
friend for shopping with VIP hair we
really appreciate your support and all
of that stuff nothing major just
probably about the hair and okay so the
pressure came packaged this like this is
the principle the frontal cam package
like this and I also forgot to mention
that the pattern I got it in is in the
water wave so this is a water wave front
tool and they have it in like this oh
they have it in like this net I don't
want to say too much about the same
smells like strong and Express hair so
this is the frontal this frontal is so
pretty look at the waves oh my god look
at the waves on this thing oh my god the
hair is so soft um it does come with
like some baby hairs in the front but my
stylist is definitely it looks like it's
kind of like already plugged and all
that it doesn't look really like a harsh
line it's kind of going with the
hairline but I'm definitely gonna have
my stylist like bleach it and pluck it
and my customized it for me oh my god
what can we talk this hair is so pretty
and it
so soft or do you think it smells like
mmm they smell a lot like Aliexpress
hair like it's real strong like I'm not
gonna say don't have a stamp but it
looks so pretty this is in between and
it is like very wide this is so pretty
like I was kind of skeptical and scared
about getting water wave but oh this
front is pretty and let me shake the
bundles will start from shortest to
longest and the longest
I mean stories next time I do this put
this wig on I need to put it in my comb
need to press it down to period like a
hump I need to braid my braid small this
something this is a synthetic awake by
the way so it kind of does nap up a
little bit but we'll talk more on that
I'll leave the video this is the 22 inch
it smells like the frontal just like
this plastic band right there on the
left sorry
I mean I'm kind of used to it being
wrapped around in a circle so I don't
want to say that it looks thin but know
few hairs the color looks like a natural
color though it's not like jet black it
doesn't look died or anything like that
it's like a natural pretty color
I'm gonna call wash this hair for sure
before I wear it oh my god when you comb
it out look how it yes I'm gonna enjoy
this hair and it's so soft like I don't
it's so soft like its toes off so this
is the 22 it actually is gonna be up
here I'm gonna co-wash it and all that
before I get installed
okay this is going to be that's one c4 I
would say that a 24 is definitely
thinner definitely thinner than a 22
my first year but this is the head
sleeps it like when you run your hands
through the curls just kind of like so
here let me show you the this is the 22
it looks longer like this one looks
longer this is the 22 this is the 24
looks longer okay the 24 that's how I
tested I grabbed it by the longest end
and I let it go and see which one is
longer so the 24 is still longer but
this one does definitely have more hair
that's 26 okay I'm not gonna lie
this is thinness look at that like
I know like it gets thinner by like the
inches and all that the longer the less
hair to give you but honestly this
better be enough flake so I'm just
running my hands through it and that's a
lot of yeah I cannot catch it but
you see dose strength that's a lot of
shitty I know all of you sure this bird
got there the website neva cut yeah so
this is the 26 I'm probably have a back
down here so it'll come down to like
comes down to like my hip that's usually
how the 26 is on me so I will see that
there is really really pretty so this is
the 26 I'm making pair of the 26 24 all
right look at the 24 into 26 all right
I'm just so boom this is the 26 right
here this is the 24 and this is the 22
look how thin it is it just gets smaller
and smaller by the inches but this is
the hair altogether it looks so pretty
like I I'm not gonna lie water wave
might just be like my new thing like I
definitely can't wait to give us it
sorry I definitely can't wait to get
this instant and here's the front so so
so far I can say that
so far I'll say that the hair sheds the
hair sheds like I ran my fingers through
there and I definitely definitely
definitely got some strands and besides
that hair shedding the hair it feels
really really soft it looks so pretty so
so so pretty and it smells like an
express hair so I'm definitely gonna
probably have this hair installed by
like next week so I'll definitely do an
initial view initial an initial review
next week and show you guys the end no
it's not gonna be initially is gonna be
