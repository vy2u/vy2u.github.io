today I have a hair review for you guys
I didn't do an unboxing for this video
well I did but I didn't like how it came
out and I had already taken out the hair
and made it into a wig so I wasn't able
to go back and read do it so there won't
be a there won't be an unboxing for this
video but I definitely wish I would have
redid it before I took it out the
bundles but oh well so this is the hair
this hair was sent to me by Aliexpress
miss her hair so what I'm wearing is an
18 inch frontal 22 or 24 and the 26 of
Malaysian Street and this is actually my
first install so as you can see I'm kind
of getting a little better I did leech
the knots and I did leave some twice
because I didn't like how it came out
the first time um I did bring out some
baby hair over here then a little bit of
right a little bit over here so far it
looks really natural you know coming up
the scalp type of thing I need a fix
this time but it's covered for now so
yeah so far I will say one thing - hair
it's like very very soft and very very
silky um barely like I said earlier like
oh I didn't blow in my other video
closely um one thing I did notice about
the hair is that at first when I when I
first got the bun was I thought they
were that pretty thin but I actually
used a lot of the hair and still have
leftover hair and I think that it is
nice and full and perfect to me
the hair is very silky and shiny
I think but I've been kind of getting
better at making this whole weight thing
this is a lace frontal way if you guys
are interested in seeing how I made this
I kind of have another one on my channel
instead of using straight hair though I
used Indian water weed so so far this is
my install and this is what the hair
looks like it's really a relief soft
really really soft doesn't really tango
everything just really goes with the
flow
I am definitely loving it I think it
looks very pretty and nice just some
long straight hair I am gonna bleach the
hair not too sure when but I definitely
am gonna be severe and it's really long
it actually comes to like um I'm trying
to get all of it it probably comes to
like my waist or my excuse the chubby it
comes to like right up here it's very
long and a little bit at my butt as well
um so yeah so far this is the hair this
is my initial review and interest
