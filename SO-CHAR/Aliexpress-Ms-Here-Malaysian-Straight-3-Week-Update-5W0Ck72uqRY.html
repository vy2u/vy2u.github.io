so today's video is gonna be basically
my 1 month if it's not my 1 month it's
definitely my three week update on this
hair this is Aliexpress miss her
HD party so miss here or miss her hair
mom I'm wearing Malaysian straight and
this is a 22 or 24 and a 26 inch and 18
inch frontal so so far what I'll say is
that I've been wearing a hair in and out
of the weeks in the days and you know I
basically I mean it's not really much to
say the hair hasn't given me any issues
I say it's pretty good my only issue
with this hand would probably be like it
has a lot of split ends oh don't mind
this part this is the frontal but it has
a lot of like split ends and I feel like
the ends they don't really get as
straight as I wanted to be and I'm not
saying that frizzy maybe I need a clip
on but because of the split ends the
ends to me don't get as straight as I
want it to get so the hair is
maintaining well I've washed it and let
it air dry and I'm not really put any
chemicals in it I just have this little
spray oil that I've put it in when I
flower on your hair besides that it's
perfectly good it's some good hair like
out of a one that's a tenth I'll
probably give this hair of a good 9 and
it's not a 10 just because of the split
ends but the hair is very full I did
make this into at least frontal way I
have like at least probably
this much left of my 22 inch bundle but
besides that I managed to fit all the
hair on there and it's nice and it's not
oh my god track
I hope you guys didn't catch this track
but I'm gonna have to reboot this I
guess cuz I do go to here so so yeah
this is the hair and it's very flowy
very pretty it's not stiff it doesn't
look dry has a nice natural luster to it
and the frontal part is ready yeah
and I'm kind of getting the hang of
frontals I probably British front so a
few times because I'm scared to over
bleach the knots so I just ended up
doing it over and over and over again
but so far the hair is managing very
well it looks very nice I'm in love with
it I don't think I'm gonna color it I'm
just gonna leave it this little black or
1bh color and it'll just be like my
throne one week what I'm just trying to
be straight and cool but this is the
hair in let me slip you guys this is
what it looks like when I split it I
actually had it up in the top bun but I
didn't like how it looked so I took it
out I thought I looked weird personally
what the hair stuff I mean I guess it's
something I just need to get used to and
now probably liked it more but that's
all for today and that's all for this
video I do have another hair review
coming for you guys so stay tuned and
get ready bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
