me you love shower and today I'm coming
to you with a new video and this is my
two-week update on this Aliexpress
spring hair brazilian straight 22 24 and
26 inches so as you can see I did
actually finally put some curls in it
this is my second week wearing it so
yesterday night I decided I was gonna
wear it curly so what I did was I went
south to the beautiful art store and I
bought some flexi rods and I got a curly
on I already had at home and I just
basically curled it rolled it up bigger
chunks like not small jokes with my Q's
chunks and I would roll it up let it sit
for like 10 seconds come to like 20 or
something unravel it out and actually
roll up with my flexi rod bending
effects running clothing I did that at
least I probably used about 18 flexi
rods to do this and this is the results
that I got in the morning so I did go
out today and I just went to the mall
and just walking around for a little bit
shocked a little and the hair the curls
did drop some but when I got home before
I made this video I did kind of like
tighten up a little bit so I can look
really good for you guys present to you
but the curls did fall but they didn't
fall too bad and hose curl really nice
and I thought that it wouldn't hold curl
that nice because you know once it's
used to being flying and flying and then
you put a curling iron to it it's not
really the same as if you wash the hair
and then curl it but this actually for
the first time ever me going straight to
curly the hair curled really really nice
like you would swear I think that it was
never straight here so in the ends look
nice as well so think what I would say
about this
that two weeks now it has not given me
any Shetty if I could rate this hair
from between a 10 a 1 to 10 I probably
give this hair about an 8 or 9 this year
doesn't give me issues like it rarely
tangles I really have not it barely
sheds like throughout the day I probably
get like 4 strings like I can run my
hands through it all day like all day
and it really rarely sheds and I'm not
gonna lie to you the last couple of days
last week I'm not even gonna lie I
really just been whatever about this
hair like I don't really sometimes I go
to sleep with it in the ponytail I
started working out now so like after
like if I go out today I work out around
5:00 so I'll put my hair in a ponytail
or wrap it up in a bun when I get home
it gets all sweaty from all this way I
shower go to bed sometimes I don't sleep
with a satin cap on sometimes I do just
depending on how tired I am and that's
my hair my leave out everything be
everywhere in the morning but all I
gotta do is brush this hair and it comes
back to life that's really all I have to
do so I would definitely give this hair
like a 9 8 or 9 because this hair is
just great like I don't have any issues
with this hair and just like if you
didn't watch my previous video I'll link
it down below which was the unboxing but
I actually did bleach the hair and
usually sometimes when you bleach hair
like not good hair it'll be kind of
fried at the ends like in like horrible
but the ends of these look great like
they look great so I'm definitely
definitely definitely in love with his
hair I'm probably gonna keep it in for a
little bit I noticed that you guys like
like more of my hair videos then more of
my makeup videos in another video so I
guess I'm giving you guys what you want
so I'm bringing more hair videos to you
I'm actually gonna upload a video soon
of how I write this up at nighttime and
I'll show you in the morning and if I'll
actually do a nighttime
when I curl it and I put in thing I put
it in the flexi rods and then one
morning when I take it out of my results
I'll show it to you um I like a video on
that for you guys so you guys can see
how I got this look right and if you are
wondering the bone makeup cuz I know I
did a good job today
I use the Anastasio Modern Renaissance
palette and I'm actually wearing Kylie
Jenner it's full oh I like this is
literally anyways but yeah I really
really do love this hair as you can see
it's not stiff it really just goes with
the flows I can sit here run my hands
through it all day a hose curl it looks
great the color looks great
it doesn't look tired or anything like
that and this is two weeks now and
sometimes I don't even write it up at
night I go to sleep with how it is just
everywhere and it's still pretty long
yeah I got rumor my 26 is down here so
it comes to like a right here in my hips
and yep
this is my hair no this is my two week
update and I'm loving it I'm loving it
I'm loving it I'm loving it I was in the
mall today like filling myself somebody
was like Beyonce I was like yes right I
like his hair I love it and I like a
curly or you want to call it curly I
don't know like I don't know with it I'd
say I curled it so it's currently now
but I definitely will be ordering some
new hair and this time I think I'm gonna
get some deep wave hair I'm not sure if
I'm gonna get a frontal or a closure I
know I've never done a closure before
I've never had one before so I was
thinking about trying it but something
about closure is kind of don't rub me
the right way I know I won't be able to
put it on myself so I'll probably have
to get it installed so I'm thinking I'm
probably gonna get some deep wave hair
and probably get like a really nice
to match the people here probably
getting in the middle part because you
know I always keep it in the middle
that's how I like my hair and yeah
