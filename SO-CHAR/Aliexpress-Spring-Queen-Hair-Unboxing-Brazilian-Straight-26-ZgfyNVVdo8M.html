back today with a hair of you all right
so this is Alex's Aliexpress spring hair
I haven't even opened it yet the
packages came this morning
I just came to that normally you know
DHL packaging and on the back so this is
spring hair Aliexpress and I ordered
inches 20 to 24 and 26 okay so this is
26 Nana says virgin unprocessed
Brazilian hair and I think it said 100%
but it's covered anyhow like that what's
that number so this is 6 mm here the
smell what is that go it's the smell
they always have and I know people be
like you smell like corn chips but I've
never smelled corn so maybe it's
the corn chips no and I don't know this
is the hair it's very soft and no
shedding so far I'd say that the bundle
altogether is kind of small but it's not
too small and the ends are nicely
trimmed I guess
okay so this is this one states this is
22
of course the smallest Thunder was like
the thickest this is again why drips it
is rich in here unprocessed for doing
inhuman air and no shedding on the 26:26
is thicker and it is thicker from the
top all the way to the bottom and it has
the same smell as well and 24 oh you
know I went to order
and this is the 24 but these bubbles I
mean the hair is really shiny and thick
there's not really any different color
hairs in it
just some here it seems to be more
shinier than others but she's me I'm
kind of sick all right so this is all
them together and it is pretty cool
makes me wonder if I should have gotten
four
and so I ordered the hair and this
Express Pass does happen here
okay so I ordered the hair on the 18th
and today is the 25th so I already
figure on Monday and it just came
exactly usually Alex right here I have
come a little bit faster but it's fine
um I would say that the customer service
was really good
I wrote the lady and she took like a
couple hours to write me back and I was
asking them up in here because I do plan
on bleaching it and I'm also gonna do a
video on reaching there so I think when
I'm speaking it and customer service as
well shipping wasn't that bad you did
need something like three or four days
everything's different I guess so
this is just a nishal review and this is
the hair and how it looks and it feels
really soft stop shedding and it's not
stiff the ends look pretty good which I
was kind of scared up with in some of
the pictures they look a little chopped
but ends look good and I'm gonna bleach
the hair before I install it so my next
video will probably need bleaching it
I'm going to like an ombre type of tone
like a three-time ombre and oh I'm sorry
they also sent me some I guess the other
supposed to be like Mac lashes but looks
nice I'll try them nice and that's it
for the view until I post the video my
next video we got in here oh I'm sorry
oh I also got so I paid one like 140
something because she had a sale it's a
sale going on I feel like we're inside
or less probably less in that range for
these three brothers and Jensen so going
on they're like three dollars off or
something like that but I will meet down
to the store below and I'll get down
there were fighting also the bundle
deals that I got there exactly okay and
so I'll see you guys in my next video
and thank you guys all for watching so
