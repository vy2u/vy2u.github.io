know it's been forever and I am truly
but I was having some nothing to do
nothing to review nothing I had nothing
I'm being real like I had nothing and
when I finally had something my power
went out
so I'm sorry for the wait
okay hi guys welcome back to my channel
so today is video is gonna be on my hair
which is from you nice hair I'll Express
I live Express you nice hair and I'm
wearing Peruvian straight and this is I
ordered I ordered a 10 in 212 and this
is actually all 12 I'm gonna tell you
what happened first let me show you an
example because I know I didn't do an
unboxing on the video and the reason why
I didn't do it unboxing on the hair is
because I wasn't feeling it like every
time I see other people do you interpret
like I'm other people on YouTube do
videos on you knees hair you know it
comes in that nice you knees box kind of
like wool wigs and all that I guess it's
probably cuz I ordered some short links
and he didn't come in a nice box but it
was lemony just some bundles in a
plastic wrap like this thrown into bag
sorry got an itch throw it into the bag
with some ugly eyelashes and I probably
won't be wearing I'm just joking but
what some lashes like just thrown in
there like that so I was just like
there's nothing big still reviewer face
probably seen an unboxing nothing major
it's some short inches and it's straight
here it's not like it's some deep wave
long bundles I'm a stretch it out
measuring and do all that type of stuff
it wasn't that so I didn't do a video so
I'm I have one of the windows this is a
10 inch
and the reason why you use the 10-inch
because I noticed that it was super
short the 12-inch was short as well but
this was super short and I was going for
a block cut look so I didn't want to get
anything like I don't know if you know
but like if you do a blunt cut in your
hair you wouldn't order you order you
wouldn't go to the buspar store and get
a 8 and 10 inch you'd probably get a 10
in the 12 or like you get kind of like
longer inches than that and you know
beautified 10 inches way longer than
this so I didn't want my hair to come
out bad or messed up I wanted to look
exactly this and I felt like this was
gonna not do the job and it was gonna be
short so I ended up going to the same
place shop trim here where I got my full
lace from and I just bought one bundle
from her for $80 now I paid for this
hair I got a 1012 into 12 which came up
to $63 unfortunately for me and my speak
saving I had to go and buy one bundle
for $80 and I think my hair is just as
nice as the UNIX hair I think there's no
difference like I personally feel like
Aliexpress is like the go-to to buy some
hair like you get it for a good price
like I got freaking one bundle for $80
and I got three bundles for $63 and
there is just a fine like it's just as
good it bleached a really nice it's
really soft like it's like still has
like shine to it and it's like it's not
stiff it goes with the flow you feel me
like I don't think there's no difference
from this hair which I should have to
pay $8 for when I got three bundles
because if you $3 anyways the hair came
I did is boring package like this you
know just normal packaging not a big
deal so I didn't feel like I needed to
do an unboxing for it and it wasn't long
short hair I did bleach this here myself
I was actually going for a more bluish
color but if the camera catches it it's
like a grayish more color so I mean it's
fine I did go and get it done
I can probably do this myself but I
definitely can't cut it myself I can
probably put it on like this myself but
I can't cut it myself so I just went got
the whole thing done um I got my hair
done on Wednesday and today is Saturday
so phony had it in for a couple days
shipping was great really really fast I
actually ordered the hair on Saturday
and it came on Tuesday I expressed in a
shipment like honestly I wasn't ripping
like I won't put that past an expression
like they should be intro to a bomb or
not and sorry guys but I had to hit the
corner of my lash with some glue like I
can't do that whole lash popping up
sticking nothing not for me anyways so
I'll move aside oh yeah the shipping was
really really fast and I can't ship lady
hair comb like this and that's that was
Express so so far so good
I've only had two hair in for a couple
days and I don't have any issues right
now I don't really have any tangling
it's all straight and it doesn't shed
it's been free streets for now so
basically this is just my initial review
and my install on it so I can't have
much to say yet cuz I know you didn't
get nappy or anything like that it's
still been cool with me so I'm cool um
also just wanna let you guys know that I
do have some upcoming videos coming up
