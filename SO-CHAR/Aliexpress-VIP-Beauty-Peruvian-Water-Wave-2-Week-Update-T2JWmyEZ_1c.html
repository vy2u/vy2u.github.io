please unless ID but enough of my
mistake
hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today video is going to be my two-week
update on this my two-week update on
this hair that I got from VIP Beauty
here which is supposed to be a frontal
and a 22 24 and a 26 inch protein water
wave first things first is so far it's
been like two weeks like I said I made
this get to know you far away so you
guys don't know this is a week I made it
into weight on the shipping I don't know
if I talked about of shipping you before
but shipping's like three or four days
I'll Express tribute always
but about two here when I first got it I
was like I made that video
when I first go watch it from the
co-founder kind of
it was pretty but it wasn't really a
spring everywhere
anyways my main issue with the hair is
basically the funnel the frontal seems
to me
dry the ends are dry and it's really
really hard to thread the hair with the
actual other hair so I will post up a
picture
I wore it the other day and I wore it
like okay yes I'll definitely insert a
picture like right here of what the
front looks like you can just try to
like wet it or put like curves and
products
and we're like waterway to me it wasn't
looking good
it wasn't pretty to me so I did my home
and I personally say that the curl
pattern with the bundles and the frontal
is off the frontal is mainly the frontal
but I say that the bundles itself
they're pretty good the curl pattern on
there is pretty even when you wet it
play with it tease it out and put this
night in it gets free it's mainly the
front seat so I would definitely say
that this front row is probably a
frickin seen like it's horrible and like
if you can see here on the hair like
this is the frontal and it looks a
little dry compared to this which is the
bunch of it is a little dry on I use all
three bundles plus the fun so this is
all what it looks like all in one it's
pretty big
pretty I just feel like I can't wear it
in its natural state
I'm I probably are gonna get
commissioned it and let it say and once
I started running my hands through it
the chrono just gets irritated I don't
know
so the panel is not
but the bundle is good and how I have a
car right now like how I have it right
now this is like straight like I can
wear like this but I will not be wearing
in its natural state or wedding and just
like that would be where you like that
hope it gets really bad right
besides that this is once a week update
I've been wearing it in and out this
week I've also got one mother believe
the test being about and seeing how
they're doing and I was personally seen
that
it's something uh pretty fun wearing it
like this is basically the only way or
another girl told me that she got this
hair and she told me it works fine for
when it's strange
so I'm guessing straightening could be
another way out but I think I like it
baby and Karina is so I'm gonna leave
you like this
no big won't do it not but yeah the
front will give of me problem give me
problems and it really gives not enough
but it's really not in a tangle and I
treat my hair really good and being that
it's a wig I don't wear it to sleep and
I don't always have it on so I would
expect it to do way better than what
it's doing but for sure for sure the
budget itself may be really nice really
soft they curl really pretty doesn't
look dry or anything like that it's
really nice so yeah this is my two week
update and I'm just gonna give it
another try you know it is aliexpress
hair and it is like really not that
expensive so you know you can't really
care about something it's not like I
paid $300 for it but I feel like one
right before it so you kind of like get
what you pay for but I'm gonna give it
another try because I just watched it I
just watched it so I'm gonna give it
another try and my final update will
basically be like my final build on this
hair but so far everything is good
but you're doing good in little crumby
so obviously kids all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
