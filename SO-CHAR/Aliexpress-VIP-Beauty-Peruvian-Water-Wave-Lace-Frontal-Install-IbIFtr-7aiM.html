yeah yeah hey guys I'm wetting my
channel so today's video is basically
gonna be on my install on this VIP
Aliexpress look at Express VIP beauty
Peruvian Indian wait offside movie oh my
god
Peruvian waterway no Indian and I have
in a 18 inch frontal 22 24 and 26 and
this is like my actual first dislike man
so I actually made the way today and put
it on today to make a video for you guys
so so far what I'll tell you guys is for
sure this hair sheds a lot when I say a
lot I mean a lot like get some hair for
you guys let me just gather up a
hairball
Oh hold it out really yourself it's just
these strings but see all the net like
yes it does shed its a cheddar and also
I kind of have like issues whoa
I actually just now drenched it down
make it kind of like drenched it down
but the front so is kind of hard to
blend the hair the front school with the
because I'm confused on why I can't even
tell you why but this is Indian water
wave the bundles Indian one away but
it's not the pretzel but the ends on the
front so just kind of start doing their
own thing like if you see like here's
the bundles and this is the front looks
like it's kind of like I don't know what
it's doing any kind of exit like when it
dries up it kind of gets like puffy I
guess I don't know what's the issue I
guess I probably needs a deep
conditioning one more time I did
conditioning before I did shampoo and
conditioning before I put it in my head
and when I did that some brownish stuff
the hair was really brown like it had
been dyed or something but I did bleach
the knots on this frontal and I do also
have a video on how to customize your
frontal and least you're not so I'll
link that down below for you guys to see
I also make down below how I made this
week or if it's down there and I'm gonna
edit it aside because no crappy video so
yeah
just making sure my camera's pretoria
because this should be trying anyways
so anyways I didn't all the hair all I
have left is this I know right one
string the track on string one little
happiness track I just fit all dinner in
here I sneeze ran out and go back on a
little bit of damage so this is the hair
it's really cool it's very pretty I will
say the curl pattern is very pretty it
is super different functions
before I washed it but it's still pretty
and I basically come back in like two
weeks let you know how its put it
through and what's going on I won't be
wearing this to sleep at night I'm
actually gonna take it off and hang it
up and stuff like that so the quality
I'll probably be treating it extra good
mean that I don't sleep with it that
night um yeah besides my main issues
that it sheds that's it it's the shedder
besides the fact that it sheds it's
really pretty and it's really nice and
it's long and it's like my hips and I
really feel like a spanish chick with is
here like I really feel like I always
win again but so far that's maybe all it
just shades and the blending with the
frontal but besides that it looks pretty
I like it it's full and it's three
bundles in the front so so I'll
definitely be probably reusing it again
I'm not too sure
I'm just a different styles on it that
you guys know maybe don't video
difference no no never know yeah but you
know this was all done by me ways yeah
so that's all for today guys um I just
want to say I am almost as if I'm not
already I'm probably almost at 800
subscribers and I'm just like I don't
know if you watched my for those that
are new like hi and welcome but those
who watch my old videos I have no like I
just like like that's what I was like so
like I'm more even like I really kicked
up because I like to
a thousand is right around the corner so
I'll for one of those guys know that
when I do get a thousand not to want to
be doing a giveaway um comment down
below on what you think I should comment
down below comment down below on what
you think I should give in my giveaway
some things that I said doing it and
it's actually gonna be a giveaway to
1000 subscribers so 1000 subscribers
giveaway so it'll be one winner for
right now maybe when I think 5 sounds
like I wouldn't do enough
so it'll be one winner it'll be real
easy to have to probably it's an art
Twitter snapchat and I'll probably like
randomly just take one personally bring
it you don't win like you might just do
that one person and not gonna mention
like I don't really have that many
people following me so you just take the
time you fight just me know when airing
like you really never know like I doubt
you will enter it so you know it's
proper like a 5 and 5 no forgetting you
have a strong chance of winning that's
like I'm not that big like I said um

want to see me do like I'm kind of
running out ideas on things to do I know
that you guys are really into like my
