review I know it's been like two years
it's just every time I would hear I
always got like I always ended up not
making a video but I decided I'm gonna
make a video cuz it's here mom anyways
so this is this is my second this is my
third time wearing this hair and this is
26 24 and 22 of I think Peruvian body
wave or Brazilian but I leave it in
description and I got it from whoa wait
this is what it came in I kept the box
because this box it's like it's so
pretty like no hair has ever came me
that's pretty from Aliexpress anyways so
I'm gonna upload some pictures really
quick and show you guys of when I first
installed it and when I wanted it
as you can see when I first had it I had
an inside part with some long curls and
when I got it done professionally the
lady she used all the bundles all three
and then in the next picture I bleached
it red or like a cherry cola type of
color and I pressed it really really
good and flat ironed it and I used not
all my bundles but at least a lot of it
but like a little bit of the 22 with
left a little bit this time I just
started back black using this L'Oreal
blue-black even though I don't see the
blueblack but L'Oreal blue black hair
dye and you guys wouldn't believe I had
put it came in a little bottle and I had
left it there and I was moisturizing
hair I'm like what the hell why isn't it
changing colors when I read the box
again it said it makes a developer so
after I mix it with developer it finally
turned black like this so all I did
really was turn him back black what the
hair dye and then I put some cream of
nature conditioner washed it I let the
criminate you're soaked overnight and
then the next day I took it out and
washed it out I let it air dry and after
that I just flat ironed it and this is
my third time using this hair and mind
you the first time I mean she is the
whole bundle the second time I did it
myself and I used like a little bit but
had a little bit of 22 left over this
time I had like a whole bunch of 22 left
over and it's like so full and this is
like this is like some good hair like
summer we're all good here and it's
still long comes out to like my hand
over here because really long and it
barely sheds barely sheds this is what I
used I sprayed this on my hair and
then I get like this thicker hard brush
and I just brush it and flatten it down
after the spray and then I get this like
silky look and I'll tell you this like
as long as you wrap it up at night like
you really don't have to flatter it
every day it stays really really nice I
still a called it at least like the
second time I wore it and then I didn't
do that this time I just used the cream
of nature and this hair is just amazing
like I'm gonna order get like I'm
telling you like I ordered I was like
I'm gonna keep doing hair reviews after
I get that first one which was some
trash hair but after that I ordered some
hair again never made time to do a
review order here again never made time
to do it then I order some terrible
curly hair and I didn't want to just
make a review bash in Elmira first
review back so I was just like you know
what I'll do it again but I'm gonna
order some hair again maybe from them
I'm looking for like some really good
curly hair so hopefully I can find a
vendor but overall minimal shedding when
I wash it it doesn't tangle up or nap up
and it dies and bleaches and comes back
to life you know the ends are perfectly
fine they're not dry they're not stiff
the hair has luster and body like I can
sit in it all day like I won't have to
like run my hand through it and get
embarrassed of like you know I get it
caught like it stays good and what else
that's pretty much it I'll show you guys
but the pictures are already listed
below and I'll probably put some more at
the end of this video but I just have
like a middle part this is actually
abondon I usually just I did it myself
actually like earlier today I did it
myself and so this is pretty much it
she looks pretty lucky back here but
nothing to burst campus
it does great so I mean maybe in a
little bit I'll probably use it again
and probably do like an ombre look with
it or something but overall whoa wigs
and their beautiful packaging is like
the way to go
I don't think I've had any issues with
this hair besides when I first installed
it I have like a Remington Wan curler
and I have it all the way up on like 450
and it kind of like dried the hair out
and the hair got a little frizzy ish but
after I washed it I didn't have an issue
with it again I just know to keep my
wand a little bit lower than the usual
but besides that um this piece of hair
right here like like this drives me
freaking crazy
and also um so I'm gonna be back on
YouTube and I know the first time I came
on YouTube I said I would not be doing
any makeup videos or anything like that
but I actually stepped my game up and I
am into makeup now I mean I was two
years ago like I've gained weight I'm
older now like I think when I made that
video I was probably in like the 10th
grade now I'm a freshman in college so
yeah and um I mean I wanted to come back
and like I'm gonna come and do some
makeup videos and things like that but
I'm just waiting cuz what's gonna big
makeup also after I come with my big
makeup off but I'll be back on you to
you guys so you see more of me hopefully
my subscribers will be happy that I'm
back I only have like 65 but in due time
it won't grow so if you guys want have
