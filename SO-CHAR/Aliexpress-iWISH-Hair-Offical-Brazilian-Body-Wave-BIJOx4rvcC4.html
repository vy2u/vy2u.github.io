today's video is basically going to be
an initial review or like an unboxing
know so I can initial review on smear
that got so this hair it was sent to me
by
I wish hair on Aliexpress and they sent
me a 22 a 20 and 24 inch bundle of edges
and the hair that I got is Brazilian
body leave I haven't gotten body wave in
a very long time so this should be a
little interesting this is my second
time over this video I'm gonna be done
broken out one nail was already broken
now I gots to rope nails let's get into
the video so it came normally shipped in
this eh-oh bag you know the same old
same old usual and that's basically it
on the bag he came in it also what's
after I opened up the game
inside of this bag right here which is
one of those little plastic bags that a
lot of companies seem to be using now
it's dust flying
so the first fun note I will show you is
my butt to go they came packaged all
separately in these plastic bags they
did come with Karin that's wrapped over
them but I did take them out so both
these are them the first one right here
is going to be my 24 and of course the
longest bundle the longest bundle is of
course the one that's actually gonna end
up being the thinnest but so far I can
run my hands through it perfectly
without getting any Sh I'm just nicely
without getting any setting in this very
bouncy it doesn't even smell bad it
smells like Aliexpress here but a stand
old hair smell I'm probably gonna end up
co-washing it before install the English
so this is the air this is 24
and I ran through it so much the next
bundle that our God is going to lead to
22 and of course the 22 is thicker and
more thicker than the 24 this is running
the hands through it
nothing just bouncy it smells like
nothing so strong this made you be like
and this of course is the last bundle
which is my 26 inch bundle and as what
is the thickest of course it
there's
also I wanted to say that the hair is
like a natural color doesn't look dyed
black it looks very like a natural
normal brownish tone but not so ground
like a 1b and so here they are all
together so this is all the hair and
three Panos I'll probably have this
installed for you guys by next week so I
will do it install video to show you
guys what I did and how I did it I'm
going for this look hopefully I can
achieve this look you're not Jack myself
up but we'll see anyways if you guys are
interested in the hair that I'm wearing
right now this is a lace frontal and
it's 22 24 and 26 inches and an 18 inch
lace pencil and this hair is from miss
her hair I lied I mean no I didn't lie I
thought it was gonna say I forgot but I
got it anyways so yeah
anyways so I will be doing my two-week
update on this video so stay tuned for
it if you guys are interested in this
makeup alone let me know if you want to
see me do it I did actually use the Mac
Paint Pot to get this color it be so
yellow like I put it over on Jessica
eyelid primer so anyways that's all for
you guys that's that's all for today
