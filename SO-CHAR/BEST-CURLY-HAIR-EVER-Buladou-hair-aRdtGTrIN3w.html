head make that hi guys welcome back to
my channel I said that's so awkward
um so you guys notice anything different
about me
okay alright I got lots of contacts soon
this is like my first time in my whole
life ever putting on contacts and I'm
not sure how we're supposed to feel but
I mean that right now it's a buck a
whole hour to get them in my eyes and
not fun you got a mint they're like
super irritated i flirt ride but I don't
know what would be a dry feeling cuz I
don't wear contacts like this i it's
just been making me so I'm guaranteed to
take some pictures upload this video for
taking shits right now
good it's bothering me but anyways um
today's video it's just gonna be a hair
review
I'm wearing Amazon here it's blue and
it's a tea Julia that's what it's called
on Amazon I have all the links down
below cuz I can't really explain it but
this is my second time trying out hair
from this company the first time I try
to no I tried out a 360 frontal with
some bundles in the hair it was like
beautiful I'm wearing a 22 or 24 to 26
and a 20 inch bundle
I made this into a wig I used a hot glue
gun because I didn't have my needles and
thread on my head um for right now for
right now this way is not oneself
because I'm still reviewing it so I have
like more videos coming up on this hair
before I decide to start the hair so you
guys are gonna ask y'all gotta wait for
this hair but honestly I don't even know
how I got something this hair because
it's so pretty
like it's just so pretty and the curls
are just so pretty so shipping usually
takes about 3 to 4 days what this hair
it doesn't take that long to come the
shedding is actually to a minimal
it's just you notices curly hair so
running your fingers through it you're
gonna get some strength in your fingers
but it's not like chunks and chunks in
chunks of hair standing around I usually
do like a tutorial on me putting it on
and whatnot but I didn't do that this
time but you know I got some Styles that
I'm going to be doing what this hair
I'll definitely get that recording I
already have like two curly routines
I've already so I'm not really sure when
what I feel like they're moving I'm not
really too sure on what else I'll do for
this but I do have some braiding
tutorials that I wanted to with this
hair and showing you guys how to do it
only thing is like I usually do it on my
head I mean all my like wig head so
doing it on my head it's gonna be a bit
different but yeah these I'm wearing
this hair for like three days now about
three days now and I put them on and
I've did my baby hairs and it's stained
like I haven't touched up my baby hairs
in like forever I just left them how
they are and they stay nice like this
and I'm a little water bottle sprayed
like every like maybe every like hours
so like I don't I want to say the hair
gets dry cuz it's not what it is but
like when the curls starts to dry it
gets puffy but it still looks pretty
like I got a lot of compliments on this
hair already and people ask me like Oh
what you put in it to make it curl like
this it is like this hair you don't
really have to do nothing but put like
some water on it and don't handle it put
some water on it and the water would do
the job so here you get you a close-up
view I like it I love it and I stick it
to my little parts I could do it
subscribe but I just don't want to do it
stop writing
y'all let me know how you feel about me
in these contacts y'all let me know if
it's not for me let me know if I should
do it in turn more colors but this hope
in my finger my I think it's hard to do
I can't do it but it's we won't see
little T
anyways y'all that was it
oh if you guys are warning about these
contacts I got a man I candy on
Instagram they sell better content man
so I checked them out there
I was trying to get the tone a darker
tone to dislike cuz you know I'm around
skin girl I don't wanna go home you know
baby blue eyes I don't gray eyes like
I'm gonna look a fool so I try to get
these but these look bright as hell so
let's see how pick them up so I'll be
back maybe like a couple days of Seoul
to do like a ton a few guys on this hair
and let you know what I think some more
about there but for now I like it it's
so pretty and it's it's a good length
it's a 26 that's a good length in its
all down my back so it's pretty good
alright so the best all for today I
think I might end up doing another video
I'm not too sure would so I don't know
look that awful today guys why I feel
like another good cat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
