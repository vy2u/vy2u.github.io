guys welcome back to my channel so today
I just have a quick video for you guys
on some hair I received from Bell virgin
hair so the first thing I want to show
you guys is the lace frontal and this is
it I've already bleached the knots and
it did come a little pre plucked or
whatnot but I did go ahead and go over
it I am going to end up if they did pre
plucky like all here so I'm probably
going to end up separating that in like
trimming that and making that the baby
hairs up here but besides that um I did
already bleach the nose and I did do
some of my own plucking on it and I also
did hit the lace on this frontal so the
first thing I'm going to say about this
frontal is that the hair is very very
soft from right now like from when I
before I bleached it the hair was super
super soft and from after that washing
it I'll even use conditioner there's
still no conditioner on it and it just
has this nice sleek look to it and I
haven't even conditioned that or deep
conditioning I just really shampooed it
I just really shampoo the hair and the
hair is very very soft
period the frontal does not shed that
much when I plugged it a lot of hair did
come out but the frontal itself doesn't
shed to me it seems like a pretty
awesome frontal and this is a 16 inch
Peruvian straight
I know you guys are probably wondering
why I have this on but this is my cow
one piece and I don't know when I got
out the shower and did my makeup I just
decided look at this I just decided why
not just throw my little one piece I'm
not going anywhere
but anyway is this it I guess this is
this sorta hair came in I'm sorry this
is what the hair came in besides the DHL
bag I guess it's like a new thing or
hair to come into this packaging because
I received a lot of hair intersecting
sometimes it's white sometimes I think
it's blue and now now an application so
I got four bundle a three bundles have a
18 of 16 and a 14 I'm not really going
to show you guys each bundle because it
is just straight hair it's not any kinky
curly or anything like that nothing out
the ordinary just some straight hair
this is the hair um it isn't a natural
color like a 1b type of color it doesn't
look diet or jet black to me it looks
like a pretty natural color the ends on
them are very nice as well they don't
look like it was just chopped through
they look pretty natural only thing I
say is that I do notice that the hair
has a lot of like split ends I'm not
sure if you can catch it now you can't
catch it but it has a lot of split ends
and to me I feel like split ends make
the hair not since the hair doesn't all
late comes it doesn't look like sleek
and straight it kind of looks a bit
frizzy so that's the first issue I have
but that's so far is the only issue the
bundle itself is pretty thick the weft
look clean and nicely on there so yeah
the hair smells normal it's smells
perfectly fine it doesn't smell usually
like Alex buzzes harsh smell
I personally this smells so regular that
I would probably put it in without
washing it but I'm definitely going to
wash it before I put it in but this is
the hair and it's very very soft it just
goes with the flow and very silky so
definitely filling it and these are the
recipes on those regular bundles
packaged like this with the numbers at
the top so nothing special about these
little bundles so that's all for today
um I don't know when I'll be installing
this hair but I am gonna make a wig out
of it I'll definitely let you guys know
when I installed it and give you guys an
update on how the hair is doing but
that's going to be a little while from
now because I got a lot of hair that I'm
dealing with and trying to put together
so but I will be using the frontal
separate from the bundles I feel a bit
I'm not too sure yet if I'm going to I
think I am but most definitely I'm going
to be using a frontal now I'm going to
actually bleaching the frontal so I'll
let you guys know how it is when I
bleach the actual hairs on the frontal
and what it turns into as well so yeah
and also I didn't want to say that I am
still going to do my giveaway um just
give me some time I'm trying to gather
up all my things and make sure
everything comes out perfect
I will also be including hair in the
giveaways I think that's all for today
