Bob I already put it on my head and
decided how short I wanted to be and now
I'm cutting it off of my head in on the
mannequin welcome back to my channel so
you guys have already watched the second
part I mean the first part or I mean we
showed you how to cut the ball now I'm
basically going to be showing guys baby
hairs for I'm probably gonna do a little
bit more plucking on this side this guy
needs to be kicked way more do this side
and then I'm also going press it out and
curly basically I'm gonna basically do
the regular where I customized
everything else I'm going to be taking
my tweezers and I'm just gonna be one
into the hair like up front over here
and it's really tough like it's full
hair so I'm just gonna take my tweezers
and slide off some hair with my fingers
and then to us about the reason why I'm
sweating my fingers down on some of
these hairs is sometimes I keep talking
uncontrollably you might cook the front
part and that might call it patches and
for you to have gaps and your baby ears
you can see my tutors back in the hair
oh my gosh I feel like I have no room
and I'm so so sorry I just had a lot
going on but I'm back for good
this week is so much harder cutting this
week mannequin head versus cutting it on
somebody's actual head like I know you
guys know that there's like a huge
difference but cutting cutting a wig on
amending hey and actually it was
difficult it's him and I do have my two
parts it's not perfect this one when I
go to the shop I'm just gonna have too
much
basically retouch it up for me but it's
definitely way way more easier when you
have somebody's head to do it on Venus
for my liking so click the background on
his hair I'm going here from the our
something like the our best hair I have
it written down right here so you guys

just speed up the process and do the
next side so I'm now officially finished

good stuff I'm gonna be taking some
Socony oil and I'm just going to run

frontal is actually pretty good quality
frontal the first time I've reached I
actually bleached the knocks twice the
first time I believed it nothing
happened it didn't really lift and I was
like oh hell no this isn't a virgin hair
frontal but at the same time I did use a
different
I used a different powder and this power
is more thicker than the one that I
usually use so with that being said I
didn't really press it through the hair
so it didn't really do anything to there
I'm going to be pressing out the Barrett
