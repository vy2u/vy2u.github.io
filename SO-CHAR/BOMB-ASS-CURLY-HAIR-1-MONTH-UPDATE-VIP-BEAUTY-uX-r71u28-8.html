don't think I can't play in it what can
I say it's complicated
hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be showing my one
month update audit addi Express the VIP
beauty here and I am wearing protein
curly I'm wearing a 22 24 and 26 inch
and also I'm wearing a 18 inch lace
frontal so I didn't move to week update
on this year but this is my wonderful
date so far I have been wearing this
hair and in our lemon sometimes I throw
it on an adult with who are they figure
now but playing with a single into has
no on it what should be purchasing this
heroine so first thing I want to say is
that this hair is absolute wasn't refute
a of crazy it's just a nice curl pattern
on the frontal itself in the air blends
in seamlessly like is absolutely
beautiful for shedding I would say it is
curly hair so when I do my routine where
I like what it up
kommen l I will get strands of hair that
probably fill up my fingers and go
through my hands I stand these tensions
on each side I split it into a student
and I go through the leg back besides
that I mean it doesn't shed out that
girl laying down together what we said
it everywhere what you run your hands do
it song you have killed understudy but
nothing major
I would say about the channel when I
wear it I like right nothing right now I
haven't like wet a little bit with it so
afraid that being my neighbor my hands
away I always call it out that's one
thing about this currently air like it
really does it not of it so shocking but
it really not up so I always get to
enthrall the identity I'll come come
down then help us break down or
something like that but you are able to
come to this here so I drop things all
time prepping I just wet it down my
dress now because I mean you can wear it
when I want you don't have to do this
but it's just I like to wait because I
just like to bring it down some if I
don't let it'll be like super huge and
super puffy and that is not my look so I
definitely went in as you can see the
frontal is pretty natural I just least
in Austin and I just kind of giving
myself that lotion just you don't have
to lay some more give myself at lunch
then one strand of dignity
so yeah I definitely do recommend here
it is absolutely beautiful I didn't have
my friend first this year and so I
borrowed
could be person and it different expects
that here that they sentence so this is
fiddly so good here
I would definitely present here this
hair is it's almost like mind you I've
had it for three months not late
it's almost with anybody including their
soul yet this pudding outlet update and
also when you guys wash the hair I mean
we wash it you let it air dry keep this
beautiful chrome patterns like it looks
like this for the programs are getting
bigger in students in terraces beautiful
is perfect pretty
it doesn't tangled up in the tangle at
all and if it does angle is very tenuous
it sheds a little with your way to get
it comes through in it but besides that
good parent is as amazing yes I do
recommend the pair and all you really
need is three bundles they're from I use
all my photos I use my place in my 24 in
my 22 and I was ready just shoved it all
in there because I was its way to be
like super super full so yes definitely
hit up VIP you hair and give you some
all right well that office hey guys
thank you for watching by me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
