today's video is basically going to be
an easy tutorial it's like a makeup
tutorial but I'm just showing you guys
how I contour and highlight my face
basically like this is my highlight and
Couture video for brown skin girls and
also baking and all that so if you guys
are interested in how I got this look
keep watching hi guys so the first thing
I'm gonna start doing is highlighting my
face with la girl Pro concealer fawn I'm
also gonna make fawn and medium beige
together but if you want you can just
use fawn I just do it to give me a
brighter look so right now I'm just
going in and face it in I'm also gonna
do my chin in the bridge of my nose so
now I'm just gonna lightly go ahead and
put medium beige over it just to give it
a brighter look and just to bring out
the highlight I'm a little bit more
brighter and now with my damp Beauty
Blender I'm just going ahead and
blending it all my Beauty Blender is not
soaking with it's just damp so I'm going
ahead and I'm going to blend
and now while I bake I'm going to go
ahead and set my foundation with this
Laura Mercier I'm sorry with the Ruby
kids foundation in the color chestnut so
I'm just going around and setting my
foundation and now with the BH Cosmetics
contour brush I don't even know if
that's what it's called
I'm gonna use my black radiance contour
palette and I'm just going to contour my
area
now I'm just going back in with that
same powder that I used to set my face
and I'm just going ahead and blend
around and making sure everything harsh
and I'm also brushing off now I'm gonna
brush off the baking powder was the same
Ruby kids and the face powder in the
color Testament that I used earlier
I'm not sure what this brush is called
but it is a real techniques brush and
I'm using that and I'm also using the
color I'm sorry it's the number throat
it's number 12 in the same ruby kiss
face powder and I'm using that to brush
off the powder and basically blend my
face is this when you do this you
basically don't get the ashy look and
now I'm gonna use I'm going fast now I'm
going to use my next face but I'm gonna
spray it down with some fake plus just
to get it to come out more I love this
blush like this is like my ultimate
favorite blush I swear it's not too much
it just gives me like a light light pink
peachy not pink but peachy look so after
I do my blush I feel like my concert
always washed it off a little bit so I'm
just gonna go back in with the same
palette and we put in some of that
darker means just to define my face more
so now I'm going to take this little
Gladish top kind of bird I got it on
eBay I'm gonna take the same palette
that I contoured my face with and I'm
just gonna go up the bridge of my nose
my nose and just slimmer down my nose
this is just everybody's favorite price
so I'm mixing my gut Mac go deposit in
my naked and luminaire in the color lit
and I'm gonna mix those together and
that's gonna be the highlight color that
I use and now with a smaller brush I'm
just gonna take that and go up the
bridge in my nose with some of the matte
gold deposit just to give my nose a bit
of a highlight and I'm also gonna do the
