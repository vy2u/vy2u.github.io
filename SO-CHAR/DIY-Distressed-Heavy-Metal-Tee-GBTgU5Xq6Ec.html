today I'm basically going to be showing
you how to make this DIY heavy metal tea
all you need is some fleet scissors and
some newspapers and any shirt that you
would like to bleach or distress fit so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to start just cutting up some
homes and putting them in the desired
spots that I want and basically how I
want it to look you can cut it and you
waited to like wherever you want to put
your whole house running however many
holes you want to do it's up to you
I'm just showing you how to do mine
right now I'm basically well I just
basically gave it that shredded look I'm
actually going to go back and put some
more in it throat I'll show you and I'm
also going to do the back and have a
little shredded look in the back flow so
basically I'm just continuing putting
holes after I cut I cut a little hole
and then I'll pull it with the scissors
and pull it with my nails so it doesn't
have that blunt cut it'll have like more
of a rip and distressed look instead of
that little scissor cuts look so now I'm
at the bag you know Mike's going to cut
along the trim of the shirt because I
want that piece to hang just a little
bit in the bag I think that look is so
cute I've seen a lot of these shirts
done that way and I definitely love so
right now I'm going to actually be
shredding the back like I said I was
earlier and basically all you guys do is
really put a cut in it and start pulling
the string little by little and added
goals to shirt we'll just start ripping
and giving you this shredded distressed
look I'm going to actually bring it
closer so you guys can see and this is
how I do it they're just pulling my mail
to things already cooking ok 30 so
basically just pulling your string
pulling it over and over and that's the
most out of the get-ups
okay thank you keep it in here so I can
get time off and I like it so now I'm
going to put the shirt back over to well
now think I'm gonna end up going that
side more and getting news that straight
it looks before my shirt
right now I'm working on my phone cuz
I'm going based off of it yourself
luckily I can't wait to wear this shirt
I think I'm gonna do like a DUI maple
hello i'm edu and we'll do it I may get
to tell you what this book and a shirt
and co-op it but get ready with me when
I find something to do
so now I'm just taking this over just
cutting up the shoulders you cut a
little hole and the trim of the arms
just give it you know Babs heavy metal
the hinge distress cool-looking look it
puts my hold you can put as many holding
you want to put no hold if you know how
thick you want it is Holly to do it
I shall I feel it is so hot outside like
Mabel is fine
okay anyways that's the trick so now I'm
taking it up stretching it out and then
we actually do some more cuts here just
a little bit more so it's really the
strength with a little bullet hole at
the bottom foot love it
all right and now I'm actually going to
start to sleep
but first I would actually put a little
bit more holes in it I'm actually going
to end up bleaching some of it and
deciding I want more
see I just got a spray bottle get
started spraying down bottom area but
I'm gonna put some more holes of beer
first before I do that now I saw that
ladies ditches watching baby they don't
want your edges using you
so now I got the bleach again and I'm
just spraying different sections with
every sections I really wanted to be
bleached at I'm just bringing it as I go
you can bleach however when you want you
don't even have to use bleach if you
don't want to use bleach but this is how
I do it
putting in a spray bottle I think that
helped me better like get it to spread
around in a certain style that I wanted
to beat in like that splatters look so I
did go really ham on the bottom and did
spray a lot of the bottom I sprayed up
at the top in the next area as well and
of course I decided this needs to be
more holy
like I said this is basically how you
want so I wanted more holes of me this
is when I decided to put more homes for
Soviets you guys don't have to put some
more holes orleans whatever you like
whatever floats your boat so I did start
springs more and now I'm just going to
basically take it up and flip the back
and spray the back some more some of you
actually went through but not that much
went through as you can see at the
bottom if I spray the back a little bit
not too much I just didn't want it to be
overly bleached in the back I really
wanted to mainly focus on the front I
kind of think I used too much bleach on
the first the top half of the shirt but
I mean if it was my first time making
tea so this
yeah
so now I'm thinking I would show you
guys what it looks hi and at first it
does give you that already effect but
basically you just have to let it sit
for a little bit and if you might
eventually start to turn white I'm
actually going to post a picture right
here and that's the end of the video
guys thank you guys for watching five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
