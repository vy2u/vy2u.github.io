here with a unboxing slash so this is oh
this is like one of those $1 everything
videos from I got this all from shop
Missy and I let you guys find this in a
lot of youtubers and a lot of other
people do this haul so everything's of
dollars so I wanted to go that in try
this out and see what the hype is all
about so I did order like a couple
things from here and go to open it and
show you guys everything that I got but
some reason it feels like there's like
clothes in here and I don't really
remember getting close but I don't know
we'll see I'm gonna start it open it up
okay so oh they have everything wrapped
up in one that's why it looks like
clothes I guess I didn't order no stuff
that's why didn't come in a box comes
with this paper that says just have fun
and hi Missy thank you so much for your
order we hope you enjoyed all the fun
goodies in the bag please read us and
show us show us lots of cool pics
xoxo the miss 18 thank you guys hope
everything is all that I was trying to
mainly get eyelashes in subject that I
wanted to read up on a bunch of masters
but all the really cute I like that I
like we're all sold out so I don't even
think I've got a pair of lashes but I
might have
so I'm just gonna like and it's like my
order sheet of everything that I've got
which is 19 items so I'm just gonna go
ahead and pick out everything wrong show
you guys why did get some lashes so the
first thing in here that our god are
these two pairs of karwa eyelashes okay
boom and these are them they're just
some lashes and they're in for they're
in for 15 and these ones top these work
for your bottom lashes
I guess these will be some lashes I wear
to like act like their meets or
something like that and those are in 83
the next thing I got is this old
headband I don't really wear headbands
but I got this cuz it was really cute
just wait maybe not do this hairstyle
that's pretty sure know what this hair
stuff but my head is so big but you you
get it I'll probably wear this when I
have like my real hair out and ponies if
I just push it back and have this little
accessory next thing let's see just have
fun
oh I got a new brush for me to bleach my
hair with this is the first purchase
this is it
this sighs - you know brush to leave I
mean like when you bleach in the hair
instant as far as the comb it out I was
having some struggles using a comb and
all that so this should help me out next
thing I got is a three piece
set of eyebrow razors and these are them
come in pink green and I believe some of
these wax my eyebrows oh no wax but I'm
not gonna lie I haven't got my
everyone's done ever what's it like to
nail shop and got him done in like
forever like I got this his business is
right here I've been using this Sally
incent thing and other wax to my own
eyebrows but she needs to be very very
careful because one time I took too much
wax they come it comes with a little
here it comes with this little stick
thing who needs to be very careful
because if you melt too much and you put
it on there that shows slide straight to
your eyelash in a chuckle wax
fell on the end of my damn eyelash and I
had to cut off my damn eyelashes
at with some scissors the next
time it happened in fell right in the
middle of all my eyelashes like right
there and they're all clump together and
I was like you know what I'm not gonna
walk around this big-ass patch on my
eyelash I'm gonna wait give it some days
and pray to God it wears off and it did
the next thing I got was just makeup
brush right here it reminds me of like
the ones I already have like this one
that I got off eBay and it's really soft
really use this as a blending brush it's
really fluffy not that bad I'm sorry I
have an issue with smelling things I
have haters and stuff like that big
issues next finger my god is old I told
my mom I got me one of these rats
Oklahoman's before it's the ones with
the metal tip and I told my mom do not
touch it and she doesn't listen she got
all her hair glue clumped in it so I got
me a brand new one and I'm definitely
gonna hide it from her this is your
brush from when you're flattening in
here this is your brush below you need
to get in there and just just like this
right here oh my god if you were sewing
I don't know if you can do this with
your wings might but I'm holding your
wigs but I put holes in my cap this is a
cap that I haven't right now oh my god
this right here oh that feeling getting
in there getting in those hard-to-reach
spots it's you really can't get in
no I'm not doing this
wait just sorry about that but you guys
you guys do not understand the filling
you need to get gentlemen if ya don't
have one oh the next thing I ordered was
this lip scrub and and I got it in the
flavor vanilla bean the other flavor
they had wasn't really feelin me oh I
wasn't really feeling down and that's
some redness and I'm gonna put it on my
lips now that she's stuck on my lips
I've never actually used the lip scrub
before so I thought why not
here's a question about lip scrubs like
after you use them are you supposed to
lick it off or you supposed to wipe it
off or do you just leave it on one
comment down below let me know and oh
excuse me
apparently ordered me some more lashes
this is one of the pairs are from Cara
lashes and the I guess it's that's the
wispy yeah you look a little flaky oh no
you're looking a little froggy like
little nappy in the next pairs oh yeah I
remember me or in these these is some
bottom lashes up and want to try out
bottom lashes for a long time and why
not start off with some dollar ones was
this stud like I'm like really a studs
girl like I go wearing the same studs
for like forever I said I wasn't there
so I'll probably end up wearing all of
these except for the black legs
someone's and whoever wants you can get
them because I'm not gonna wear no black
earrings but yep this does even all
these for a dollar you walking over to a
new watch
you like for 60 no for eighty or eighty
and oh it's like glitter liner I've been
wanting to do like us makeup look we're
sorry can't see no I wanted to do like a
makeup look word like I have on my black
eyeliner in and they're like the glitter
line right over it
I was seeing that and I needed to
get one of these to do it I mean like my
haul video speed um long and stuff like
that so I'm trying to like same time
okay just trying to do like a couple
coats but boom y'all see that
y'all see that glue yeah and then the
next thing I thought was this jumbo eye
pencil this is kind of like hold on cuz
it just fell - should've been picked up
I knew I was gonna show ya how do I keep
my makeup on the floor oh no it rolled
away over there I'm sorry I have another
New Year's okay the jumbo pencil the
next double fit so our kind of guy of
replicas but this is an le color le girl
no other course jumbo pencil in deck
better have got anyway seashells which
is oh my makeup on my hand so say why
the hell is it coming off tan and makeup
on that side you know I dip and dab that
is to jump - so far that this is the
last thing in the day so I got me some
new belly range yes I do have a belly
ring that is like the only thing I chose
besides this thing right here that's
going straight to my ear oh I know edge
down my
either but I got this one it's just
white way like a little diamond in the
middle I've been eating so many bedding
rings and all this is little this
one looks small as hell but then I got
this one it's like gold with the pink
diamond on it can you see it yes and
then I thought this D should look little
with hell then I got this one which is a
sunflower I think I'm gonna put this one
down sit still like summertime in my
last one and this is um
Jesus a saber wheel a boat will anchor
no an anchor is the that drops down cake
this is like a standard boat wheel with
bedazzle on it bro cute and the next
thing I got was this little bedazzled
hair clip
I've been eating something so I can flip
up my hair while I flower in chunks of
it so I picked up one of these in its
bedazzled queue another line of work
it's kind of hard to pull but rope you
oh this is the the brush cleaner egg
thing oh and the directions are on the
back I got this just I've been wanting
something cool I guess you're supposed
to put your fingers in there get some
soap and jumper jumper Jojo and I guess
that's just gonna make the movement and
all that just like scrub your crush just
