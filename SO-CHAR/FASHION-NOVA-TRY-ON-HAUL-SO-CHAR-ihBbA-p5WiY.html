hi guys hi guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm gonna be doing a
fashion doll for child
oh it's been like forever since I've
done one DS so I'm going to be I ordered
like a bunch of sessionable this isn't
even like all the things I have is kind
of like what I really found I had a
swimsuit but I cannot find the top -
it's over and somewhat up its I'm
already warned all right the first thing
that I'm going to be showing you guys is
this two-piece camo and I have been
hanging like this but basically it's
like it's just a crop top and it has the
matching bottoms so I'll probably have
it like right here what it kind of looks
like and how me I also have this two
piece set in olive green but I can't
find the crop top so yeah that's the
first piece the next thing I got
professional is similar so the first
thing I just showed you guys but it is a
black version of it in the pants aren't
long they're not capris and I'm going to
say I got the other outfit is large I
had got the on the camera off but I got
in too large the other outfit I had got
in the medium and in this outfit I got
it in a large so this is what it looks
like on and the material is very good
she and it's comfortable this material
doesn't really look like it's the type
after you wash it and it begins to fade
I don't think this material has that
effect so wrinkly with acute in love
this boat caching a little two-piece as
you guys can tell families I love
two-piece outfits and it's kind of like
a little obsession at hand but here's
another to piece off of that I brought
this is just long leggings and imagine
the sports bra and I also got this any
size large the other tag is going this I
don't know why but this is the Z and
this is what it looks like on the
material is very very thick throw in the
broad it fits really really snug the
next outfit I got is another two-piece
Alfie and this is what it looks like
it's just a halter top and I have the
matching pair of shorts and I don't need
to finger you guys will see right here
how it looks
this outfit is just really really cute
and super flowy for me to wear aa casual
days but I'm not gonna be wearing this
anytime soon because you go is still
Cuddy and also another thing that I
don't know
but nothing that I got was this little
schlong Lafayette stuff
mamacita crop-top little something i had
got some magic jean shorts to wear with
this but I actually left them upstairs
because they can't even button on me
fashion of a large is not for me
like the large and fashion over jeans is
not for me I needed like a 2x large or
an extra-large but yeah so I'm going to
be pairing it up probably with some
other parents not the ones that I end up
getting the last two things that I got
is this jumpsuit I love love love this
jumpsuit it kind of has these little
stripes on the sides it's small it comes
all the way down like a whole body suit
this jumpsuit is super super cute so I
mean I've already worn it and I need to
hurry up and get my wear on and I got
this in a size medium just because I
hate when it completely large and it be
loose in certain areas already tight all
around and be fine the last thing on go
on is another bodysuit and I actually
got this one in black and I know it kind
of looks like a regular old body suits
but it is not it has mesh on these sides
so I'm going to be wearing this I'm
actually probably gonna put this on with
this shirt that I have on and wear it
this shirt that like a cover top because
this shirt shows too much of
my bra underneath and if you guys are
interested in this this is a two-piece
with a matching skirt I got it from a
boutique on Instagram shop L boutiques
