today I'm going to be doing this fashion
over so today I'm going to be doing it
is fashionable to try and offer you guys
um I got this thing by over a month or
two ago and I was just taking forever to
release them on the pants that I got
were like extremely too small so
hopefully I was able to fit until now
so I mean video feedback so I got a
couple things not so big it's not too
small and I'm just going to go ahead
about one by one and I'm going to side
or the side so you can see what it looks
like on and just let you know I did
first are taking my money and I am my
first size are a date I'm a thirty sixty
and my bottoms are usually large so my
shirts I wear mediums and my buns I
probably wear a large and in jeans I'm
like an eleven just such a guy so it's
like the fit girl national trial huh
so first thing I'm gonna show you guys
is this a bodysuit and fix it for you I
did not make a video I did not try this
on on camera because I mean this is what
it looks like
and it's super pretty you have nice tone
and it has a little clip left and bottom
but I didn't try this on because the
zipper came messed up on it so it
doesn't fit all the way up I mean it
doesn't sit down it literally doesn't go
anywhere it's like I was jacking with it
for the longest now and I've tried to
pull it apart and pull it down and it
oh now for nobody and plus I even though
have no push my big-ass head through
this part and when I did that it kind of
made it looser so I don't really know
what I'm going to do with this maybe I
will just cook the next arrow and just
wear the body food I'm not too sure yet
but I didn't try to stop you
so that's the first thing I thought and
this is called the audition bodysuit in
the color ever and $22 and I got it in a
size medium
it fits nice it's just the whole neck
part is really my main issue the next
thing I got is these the famous
two-piece which is about the same
obsession a little gray sweat suit this
is what the top looks like and the top
and the bottom are sold separately the
top retail for 1297 and I got it in a
medium is no longer bucks tops it's a
crop top pudding and the material on
here is like really really stretchy and
comfortable ok so the next thing I'm
going to be showing you guys is the
bottom to match them and here are the
bottom is they come down like some
leggings they are super stretchy only
think though I could get the top of the
medium and I should have gotten the
bottom in a large because the waistband
is a little too tight for me it kind of
pushes my tummy it makes me look better
than what I already am so hopefully I
lose some more weight in images you know
I was waiting with me like smaller or
bigger for me but yes these are follows
in these bodies go for $19.99 so shirt
is like 1297 in bombs are like $19.99 so
that's not too bad at all I think but
nope has not
things that things I have loved working
the next thing I got is just this little
crochet top I got this for like the
summer time it's right now so this is
what it looks like and I think I
personally should have gotten it I got
this in the side oh I got the tag
I'm pretty sure that this is a medium
level
oh it's large I got in the size large
and I remember that they didn't have no
medium and I know I was going to do it
to a small side get a large
unfortunately like my top is way smaller
than my bottom so it's really loose in
the back and in the front part so I
guess I'm gonna thought we have to just
tie this because I come to the tie right
here so I'm probably not but I did tire
going to actually go so we can fit my
back better in yes so this is the fog
super super cute and I'll have
everything with the dump ability doesn't
see prices because I wrote the ten
dollar level and to wear that I got that
with beads matching shorts and these are
them they have some personal yo I got
these in a size large and I definitely
should look for extra large because my
size are busting out of the hope and
these hands like they are but now and
this is the back of home looks like I
mean they're super stretchy though but
the next of our probably didn't be just
fine anyway though you always just kinda
just loosen them into Sonora and these
came to $34.99 and they are called an
angel and Lucas con shorts so ya got
these connects with principal stretches
really really nice and they are as well
high waisted the next thing I got was a
Dean at hand beings are so rational
machines of corner
I just felt like a chameleon for you I
just felt like I needed some new jeans
in my corner like I don't really have a
lot of jeans so I got me just my spare
some high-waisted blue jeans and they
are skinny at the bottom so these as
well got them in Lilith and I maybe I
should've gotten 13 but I want to buy
all my clothes way too big for me and
when I lose my weight that's big
so face it it could have formed in like
a couple inches bigger but yeah so these
are my little bit of jeans and these
retail for about $34.99 and they are
called the classic highways this game
denim jeans and stuff and I got this as
you wear with that chestnut bodysuit
that showed you in the beginning of the
video but don't seem like it's going to
be working out for me
and then the final thing I thought was a
little cute dress so this is the last
thing of god it's just this little it's
also comes down to your shoulders and
it's kind of like long-sleeve but it
cuts off with right here and it's super
short so this was the last thing I got
and I also got this in a size medium as
well and this dress was is retailed for
$29.99 but I believe I got it on sell
for about 15 something so I really do at
Mastro's it's really nice and it is
super comfy idea so the arms on them
does net part seems to roll up so I'm
probably going to end up song them down
so they don't move because it is super
annoying having to do this every 40
minutes so yeah so guys that is the end
of my session over Tryon home I hope you
