brought me up won't you let me down

could you hold it
Gero all right hi guys welcome back to
my channel so today oh my god listen if
y'all see my wrong y'all gonna let me be
because this little v-neck thing I
bought this from this girl boutique
supportin but that that don't
fit like it's showing my biddies so um I
didn't do it install video I'm sorry
y'all I've been throwing out way too
much install videos and I literally just
gave you guys a three-part tutorial to
put in the laces I decided that to hell
with it my breasts show my breasts show
oh no not the nipple stone I'm gonna do
a little curl tutorial depending on
where you're from depends on what you
call this style but where I'm from from
Miami and down here we call this like
the Roller set soft look so um I'm right
here from lucky look I like lucky lucky
hair and I have all the information on
them list down below and I'm wearing
Brazilian body wave my friend so is an
18 inch and the bundles are a 20 22 and
24 inch I'm gonna I haven't worn like
short hair like this in a extremely long
time so I'm gonna begin by just
reporting my hair I've already installed
the hair and put it down with lace cool
I'm gonna go ahead and answer this
question in the beginning of this video
for those who don't make it towards the
end a lot of people are constantly
asking me when I put my hair down with
lace crew you guys constantly eyes how
long does it last and I have oily skin
but I do not sweat a lot I don't be in
the Sun the glue guy uses the ultra
halloo and that's the one I used right
on this install and the ultra halloo is
not it's waterproof but it's not really
sweat proof so depending on how much you
sweat basically will depend on how long
you're in
or less and also maintenance you know
turn it down every night not getting it
wet in the shower also is a big role
plays a big role in how long you make
your install less so I've just got my
hot comb and pressing out my hair I laid
it down with the Caracara wax leak all
the products that I list on him but the
description box will be our products
that I use will be listed down in the
description box a lot of you guys tent
asked me what kind of hot comb this is
and I don't know the brand it's like
rough it says maxi but you can get this
hot comb for like thirteen dollars at
your local like Sally's and stuff like
that they're very affordable and most of
the things that I'm using you can get
out of my store and there are space
valleys I didn't mean to say said I'm
gonna say like Beauty exchange cuz that
means they're gonna wax you put them the
white people know why people would want
to talk about this all right let me just
forget what else on the stage all right
so I guess um I just done this hair
styled like a while ago when I was
younger but I never really mastered it
but I'm gonna go ahead and give it a try
now I'm gonna be taking the back and
just putting it into bigger curls
because this is the bag I don't really
care about it too much and I'm not gonna
really OD myself on the back it's all
about the curls in the front and how
they fall I purchased this jumbo curling
rod our questions this jumbo sized
curling rod from Marshalls and I think
this is only like 30 something dollars
but anyways I'm gonna be using this
curling rod I'm not really gonna just go
into detail too much by talking because
I'm really not worth this I really don't
use this like this is my first time ever
using it and I don't do these curls that
often but being a hair stylist like I
want to be able to master a lot of types
of different types of hairstyles so you
could always say classes or it can be
like me and try and learn it yourself
so I always had right now I think I
probably took too much hair up let me
stop right now I have all the way on the
heat 450 and I'm just going to be taking
this big old piece and I'm gonna pull it
and I'm going to curl it so I like to
take my nail and pick it up and I don't
really have known why do have pins but
I'm not about to get it I'm just gonna
hold the curl in my hand and let it kind
of cool down and just drop it so this is
what
what does curl this just won't curl this
walk row this communion is no joke
anyways y'all I'm feelin this hairstyle
like it's not even done but I feel like
I'm giving out like real life lawyer
tees you know I'm saying like some Mary
being Mary Jane T's so now um this is
like basically the main event and I'm
gonna be taking this curling iron I mean
I'm gonna take my comb and basically
running my hands through the hair in my
country by the way this hair is real
solid like I haven't put nothing in it
like no Bibles or nothing and it has
like its own natural shine alright so
now we're gonna be taking this little
section just decide that you know you
want to make sure everything goes right
cuz it's the front piece I am gonna be
also cutting the hair but I'm not gonna
cut this side I'm gonna cut me I'm gonna
cut this piece over here in a little bit
of this side so I got the curl out oh

I have somebody with this fight I'm just
gonna take my hand pull it back up and
just
do a little loose curl with that and now
I'm gonna take that's this part and I'm
gonna get this is another thing that you
guys will definitely need um I picked up
mine from what do I get this from
oh whoa I think you got take it from
Courtney's you're watching it Courtney
I'm sorry but it's a razor comb you can
find a set like oh ho buddy it up a
lot of hair just came out Oh short piece
of hair right here good enough like I
said I just bought first time Charlie
narrow but you want to raise it your
hair so the curl can hold more because
with long curls
you really have to cut the curve cut the
hair so it holds because if you don't
cut the hair it's something about like
gravity along here it'll fall it
won't like hold I'm just gonna chop all
right and now I'm gonna go ahead and
turn this side I really do not know what
I'm doing but your girl is trying to
would be more chance with this time when
it comes to racing in the hair
not bad kind of from when I was trying
to go for that good yo it could be a
little tighter but this is basically
what I'm looking for I think overall
this might be a little too big
no hmm no this is actually pretty nice
like some just some loose drop curls I'm
actually gonna just fast forward a bit
until I get back to this side because
this side is like basically the main
side in the main event
all right so now that I've finished
throwing in my little curls see that's
why I need to cut this more shorter so
it can on I'm gonna cut this part in
more shorter look and hold more curls I
only think don't forget remember how
this is done but I used to wear this
hairstyle I thought when I was in high
school and stuff I should wash the
father since when you ought to end up
being a stylist
see
it's hot but it's okay once I like
practice this style more I'll definitely
get it so I'm gonna copy do my hair in
layers I'm basically gonna take this
part and I'm just gonna layer it so now
I'm gonna begin to curl my hair
I took the wand curler come on brother
the curling iron and I'm gonna
I want my curls going in this direction
but first scene so I'm gonna take you
like this get it to the tip and I'm just
gonna rolled it up I wish I would have
liked some cans put some pins in my hair
with all those Shanti T's this girl came
out pretty nice but I'm going to take my
razor comb and razor out this piece
this is problem pretty nicely your own
about trial and error
making mistakes and correcting them
good balance on the is because of the
layers layers are like important
important
oh you saw that little no rib side
little wrist action I'm honestly just
hoping like I don't drop this iron on my
head like I'll burn myself with it like
I'm gonna make sure that this side is
very very
so doing fish it dropped ridiculously
i watch the television the easier to use
let's try that again
right then just keep going
but I mean they I cut this also
what in the
I met
chantÃ© chantÃ© yo
I literally see a piece that I really
like cut too short and I'll see you
right there
I'm definitely gonna try this out again
like nothing I just thought this time
like have me discouraged because they
really don't look bad in my mind of what
I actually wanted
no ordinary
I know I think this car is about to be
lit I'm actually gonna let it curl see I
just redid this side and it's giving me
sweet giving me a dream girl I'm not
leaving without you I'm not living
without you you you and you you you're
gonna love me oh I collide I think this
that is good but bought bought bought
this piece sees this whole thing I'm
here too long like three crota's piece
right here not each other
but yo I like it I know it's gonna drop
because I'm not gonna put enough in
