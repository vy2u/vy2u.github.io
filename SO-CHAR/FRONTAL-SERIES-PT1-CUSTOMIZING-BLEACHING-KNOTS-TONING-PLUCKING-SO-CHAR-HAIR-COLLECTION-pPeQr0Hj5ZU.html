is from my hair collection and the first
thing that I'm gonna be doing to it is
all the little baby hair that's flying
in the air I'm gonna be taking my
freeze-tag spray and I'm gonna be
putting it on the hairline and just to
keep the baby is basically down
Russian aggression sorry I'm using this
racket to come home you got hurt but
anyways so now that I've basically
brushed all the nodes is it prevent the
hairs from getting caught in the bleach
in having like little hairs at least on
it and I'm just gonna do another round
right
and now I'm going to be taking the BW to
bleach my feet for one friend to be
probably like one school so probably
like a scoop and a half and I'm going to
be using a thirty developer and with
using thirty developer my friend who is
like a really high quality friends were
sold it all depends on the quality of
the fronts on how long you keep it on
but because mine is like grade it's a
very high grade hair and the quality on
the frontal is very good the hair bleach
is really fast shut up you know I'm
recording
I suggest you probably keep it on for
like ten minutes because it does start
turning superfast
you loud purpose
so now I just keep on doing this and you
want to mix it around so you have like a
nice thick consistence whatever like a
thick page I'm gonna put a little bit
more so that do need me and I'm gonna
probably put extra because I do have
another frontal that I'm gonna bleach
right after I've been fine
all right
need more developer and you gotta be
careful on developer is best if she put
it in and then put little amounts at a
time it's best that you pour it in and
then do little amounts at a time because
this developer can make it watery and if
you make it too watery it's really like
ruined for some more
sit in and now I think I got it too
a perfectly good complicity is not too
thick it's not so watery but it's just
right so now this part is very very
simple you just want to take a nice to
come out I like to start from the middle
and you just hold it and basically just
lightly kind of push it in not really
push it in but lightly smear it and
better wear it slightly smear it against
the frontal get some hair
keep on going get some more keep on
calling
and you guys also want to make sure that
you're not getting too low because you
sometimes people do end up bleaching
these parts which it doesn't show but
bleaching hair kind of weakens the hair
so you're gonna only not overuse the
amount that you have to use only use a
little bit so that you know you know
really have ruined the weekend is here
effective now keep going
mmm you're recording sweetie you all
right guys so now I'm basically done via
this cameraman I really did make a man
but okay trying to get in there quality
quality control quality front so now I'm
gonna lift it over and show you the
front as you can see none of the bleach
is on top of the laser as you can see
like it hasn't even been 10 minutes and
the knots are like already bleaching so
I'm probably gonna leave it on for like
10 minutes 10 or 5 minutes and I'll be
back to show you guys what it's the
ending ragazze look like before I wash
it off and then I'm gonna wash it off
and I'm gonna use shimmer lights to wash
it off so you guys can see that and I'll
come back and show you the finished look
action so this is what the nos look like
not a different bleach as you can see
the roots are more brownish oh and it
focused alrighty
now I'm gonna go ahead and just wash it
off and after I washed it off I'm gonna
wash it with shimmer like shampoo so it
can kind of tone the hair alright action
alright so as you guys can see now the
knots have been bleached and this is
what they look like now it's showing
more of a natural scalp I don't know it
looks yeah exactly so good observation
and those kind of red and it looks kind
of orange is kind of brassy so that's
where the shimmer light shampoo comes in
so I'm gonna take the shimmery light
shampoo and I'm just gonna go see for
the vents alright very good
I'm gonna take the shimmery light
shampoo and I'm gonna rub it into the
knots and I'm gonna let this sit for
about I want to say 5 to 3 3 to 5
minutes and I'm doing this just so that
orange brassy looking go away this is
basically like a shampoo toner so it's
gonna tone the hair and it was magic no
I'm saying make that magic baby
all right so I'm gonna rub it in and I'm
gonna put it down and I'm gonna let it
sit for a few minutes and then I'm gonna
wash it off and then we'll begin the
plucky and all that good stuff alright
we'll be back in 5 minutes
adios alright so now you guys can see
after that it doesn't look red anymore
it looks toned and I'm gonna now leave
it in some conditioner the
concessionaire go smooth because they do
come on I deliver is just your hand was
buying it yeah so the condition that I'm
gonna put it in is am called so the call
mix and I'm gonna let that sit for a
couple more minutes then I'm gonna wash
it off and I'm gonna come back and show
you guys how I plug it and make it look
natural that looks nice
so yeah we got don't forget shimmer
lights shampoo
yeah and you know more products got to
be blue
let it focus there you go blasting free
spray screaming what is it
Reese expert yeah okay then we got some
of this is what we use as some product
and we got it right here
yeah that's tough well we got hot sauce
on the table my bags we got some of this
I don't see this is what it looks like
before
you
so basically that's all I really do
just a bite plugin are you started back
without me yeah it's got a bed without
you you were gonna you see up into your
dress okay alright so no I need a refill
y'all you need a refill what my nails
oh yeah don't things was it alright
oh yeah well I just watch this child's
old man's in anywhere
it's too it's too big for the phone are
you getting me plucking it oh yeah I was
getting it's too big for the phone
onto this side dog I'm not gonna like
these frontals are like the bomb calm
like look how easy the hair is pluck off
usually they'll paw like some quality
frontals it'll be hard to maintain
they'll pop but this the hair is just
come off so quality easy it flows off
quality control and then you kind of get
in there
I cannot wait to do an install on this
like y'all not ready
you ever recorded it install yeah but
not on bomb here like this
y'all watch the technique honestly it's
obvious that you guys won't go as fast
as I do but once you guys get used to it
you will there's a amateurs don't try
this at home
wouldn't wanna mess up a good front to
it no you got to keep practice until you
get it I had to jack up a few fronts as
before I got it oh all right practice
space Percy
so basically like you guys can see the
sculpting of the baby hairs and on that
like that's how simple baby here's my
