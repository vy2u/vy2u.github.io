forgot to hit the camera and hit record
so I didn't get where I centered it but
I basically it's super easy to aim to
basically align the frontal with the
dome cap and make sure that the lace is
at least 2 inches above the dome cap and
then after that you just pin your pins
on the side so I've already started
basically sewing the cap on to the dome
cap I I like to use the men's dome cap I
feel like at the tighter hold when I use
the men's own cap I have that elastic
band in the back so I do not need to add
any clips it has a tight stretchy hold
already I don't have to add a band or
any clips to it so that's basically what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna just keep on
sewing this along until I get to the
other side
all right so now you guys can basically
see I've already sold the whole head and
I basically just sewn the frontal down
and now I'm going to begin to braid
braid I'm gonna begin to sew on the cat
this was on me I'm gonna begin to
sew on my bundles on to my dome cap and
this is here from my hair collection
this is Brazilian straight very
high-quality I like to stick the thread
the needle through the thread and then I
like to start sewing it on I just
personally feel like while doing that
the track basically have a tighter hold
and it's um it's really hard to unclick
it's already or not and then it's a knot
on to the cap so it's it's tight and it
basically will never untangle unless you
cut it off so I'm basically gonna
continue this pattern all the way up
until I get to the top of the head I
just filled in this little part so you
got to make we get an understanding on
how I'm sewing the tracks on to the cap
so now that the wig is finished I'm
basically gonna um untape out the braids
I put the braids they're just basically
keep the hair out of the way while I sew
on the track I'm gonna take off off the
braids and now I have my scissors and
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to cut
off that extra piece of the dome cap
because we don't need that piece anymore
and it's definitely gonna be in the way
of our friends oh by the way make sure
that you guys do not cut off the
threaded part you need to make sure you
cut as close as possible to the lace but
make sure you're watching out for the
lines cuz if you do cut those threaded
lines your trunk your wig will basically
fall apart the front will completely
come on so basically that's how you
construct the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
