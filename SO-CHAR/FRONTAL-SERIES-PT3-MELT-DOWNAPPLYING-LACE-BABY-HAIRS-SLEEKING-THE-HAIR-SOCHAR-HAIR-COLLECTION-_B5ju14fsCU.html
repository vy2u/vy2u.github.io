now we're going to be doing part three
of the lace series and part three is
going to include melting down your cap
doing the melting up during the
meltdown method and also applying the
lace so basically you guys have already
seen how bleach my knots how I took my
friends oh how I make the wig how I
press it out and get it prepped and
ready to get put onto my head now you're
gonna see how I get it to look to make
it look flawless
the first thing that I'm gonna do is
pull my cap I like to pull it above my
ears on both sides and I'm going to be
using a tank cap these one cost only two
dollars or some local newscaster sell it
for a dollar depending on how much what
you want or trying to rip off but they
used to be a dollar but now that they're
popular you're more than a dollar
anyways I hope I don't get my eyebrows
messed up I'm going to be taking my
brush and I'm gonna be putting my
foundation basically the foundation of
my skin tone is the foundation that I
like to use on the lace and I'm just
going to be going in with my color
foundation you can use whichever
foundation that you are this works very
very well I've seen people use the brown
cap a lot of you guys ask me why don't I
just use the brown cap I personally
don't like the brown cap on my skintone
I just rather put makeup on it and get
it closer to my skin tone with the new
chap rather than using a dark brown cat
but for darker girls who are darkening
me I would recommend the dark brown cap
all right so now I've only done a tad
bit you don't want to overpower the cap
with foundation but as you guys see my
hairline is right here so I'm going to
put freeze tax Brady I don't know why I
call it freeze tech because your nice
aunt Freitag bootie
that's what you say in freeze head but
it's just called blessing free spray I
just not realize that but I'm gonna
spray this onto my hair all right so the
nozzle is and sometimes you guys if
y'all use this then y'all know the
nozzle get so I dried up and it starts
squirting everywhere one time is
squirted in my client I was like oh my
god sorry it's fine I know and I had
their shoe by does this so I'm gonna be
placing it right here above my hairline
and as you got to my ear - she's cold
you know I didn't go too far over here
that's because I'm going to be taking my
lace pool and I'm gonna be using a ghost
bar lace glue and I'm just going to this
was actually the original blue that I
started using before so it will using
ultra hold oh my god I love goes on I
found out about ghost mine through the
hairstyles and lastly nearing a
tea-length if y'all know area - then
you're known this man is a beast I know
they say that I care supposed to be
looking up but I watched a video where
he actually you
and also more Jada not that she does
hair but she be doing here she also had
recommended school around this time
saying this little nervously schools now
I'm just gonna let this dry for a few
minutes and then I'm gonna come back and
basically show you good next steps
alright so now that it's dried enough
I'm just gonna go ahead and cut off the
excess lace I like to cut off the side
and then cut a little bit come here I'll
walk hitch dinner alright we did cut it
and now I'm just going to get it close
to the skin as possible
they're not too close and just like that
I'm going to be
move away
power
my hero
um you nothing that I want to add as
well
you know this is like super hard doing
this on yourself first is going on so
money is supported here alright so you
know I've done yeah I'm going to Shh
okay and I think I'm gonna mention that
all these cabs do come in different
sizes but I recommend you get the red
brand this one is just to me is the
ultimate one of the best ones there's
another one that comes but when you pull
it down it kind of has like a stretch so
it's like a two different color tan line
I recommend that you get that with the
red brand so this is what's not like
your hair is on to me anyways this is
going to be here from my hair collection
if you guys didn't know I do have in
your collection
and right after I upload this video I
will be having a wig cell coming up next
so you guys would actually get to see a
bunch of the wigs that I have in the
ways that I've made and that I have four
so I do have useless and I haven't do it
they're all still going on sale and will
be available for purchase so this is my
hair collection this is my straight hair
the hair comes in a natural color all
I've done to it actually so far I didn't
um I washed the front too but I didn't
wash the bundles so it's not KO watched
all I basically did was flat iron it and
I put some cheat on it and it hasn't
even been washed in the hair like I'm
gonna like you know hair always come
with this frickin smell but surprisingly
my bundles didn't come with that smell
so I didn't feel like I really need to
squash it so this is the front this is
what it looks like on the inside I'm
just gonna go ahead and give it a try
own
and then I'm going to fold it forward
it has a pretty good fit this is what
it's looking like
look at this hairline go I cannot wait
too late I can't like you don't stand
how much I cannot wait to like put this
hit like I couldn't wait to try my own
hair out look so I've just tucked my hot
come on so I can go ahead and readjust
the part but here like the main reason
why I wanted to start selling my own
hair is because as if you guys don't
know I've been doing hair so I have a
bunch of clients who do come with me
come to me and they're frontals be so
trash and I have to do like a whole nine
just to get it looking good like I have
to sit there plug the
sometimes I have to bleach their hair
twice because the not to own bleach from
the first time because it don't be 100%
virgin hair and I just
and then there's with clients that I've
come across who have really bald
frontals and their installs come out
looking like milk like it comes out
flawless so like I know the difference
between a good front one a good frontal
and now that I realizes these other hair
companies and I'm not talking about like
trying to base companies I'm talking
about like a real company like someone
like that wants to start your company
they have the option on what kind of
great hair they want to buy and they
choose to get the cheaper route I'm so
proud of like when I say you're lying I
don't mean like literally this hair line
I mean like my company like my brand
like this is one of this is something
like I've kind of wanted to do for a
fair for a long time I just never felt
like I just never had I'm gonna say the
dry - I just I didn't have like the
opportunity you know you gotta put a lot
of money into doing like into um
starting a hair business and stuff like
you don't really come easy think but
I've saved up my own money
just what I wanted to I saved up my
money I said I'm gonna do this I tested
out a few vendors I picked out which one
I flew and by the way my vendor is not
from Aliexpress the thing is pretty good
around my ear it does need to cut a
little bit more maybe like this whole
little section right here
that's all right here
yeah so this part is quite good and
forward
this hair is so pretty like I don't want
to I want to take it off like I'm gonna
keep you away forever like that 30
inches was worth it
if you're not used to study the corners
of your nasal I need to suggest you cut
it the way I just did it if I was you
since you're not really used to it and
stuff like that you should definitely uh
take it off and cut it cuz you don't
want to end up cutting off the hairs
alright so I basically now fit it to my
head and okay so now this is my part and
this is basically where I'm going to lay
the lace so I'm gonna go ahead and take
my white pencil and I'm just gonna dab
in the corners right here right here
goes in right here comes out right here
does it differ here this way things I
basically do it this way so I can kind
of see the curves in and out of my hair
from my lace as you can see it wasn't
that off from my skin tone but I am a
Gaussian girl maybe if you were a
lighter like a red girl or Spanish you
wouldn't be able to you know really do
nothing to your lace but I am a sound
skin girl and the lace does appear a
little bit too light for me so I'm just
gonna take my foundation powder and I'm
gonna put a little bit of the rings like
on the inside of the lace just to make
it more to my skin tone as you can see
like I've now colored the lace I didn't
really do too much sometimes if you
overdo the color of the lace your
hairline in your part might look orange
oh my gosh look at this way instead of
tear right now alright so now I'm gonna
take my girls ball and I'm going to be
using this little wooden stake these are
like those same sticks that people use
like for popsicle sticks is what they're
called you can still use that doctor's
office alright so now I'm gonna start
off by it's okay it's freaking Oh
exceptions button
so this clue is like a really fast drive
so you want to put it on and work it
through as best as you can because it's
gonna mess around
that the first way you tried the glue
does strike clear as you can see some
parts for drying faster than other and
after that I'm gonna put on my second
coat and I'll be back when it's time to
cut off the lace and reapply to wake up
y'all watch or a tornado spin and change
it don't go so much alright so the glue
put two coats I usually put like two or
three but I'm only putting two and now
I'm just going to cut around the lace
remember you gotta cut the lace and nice
big size don't ever cut it just straight
Frost
alright so this is basically how I cut
those please
as y'all can see I cut the lace in like
zigzag forms everything is not going in
one direction it's all like chopped up
so now I'm just going to put with a wig
in my head don't put it like back here
alright so right here and also y'all I
know your hurdle if you guys are into
hearing y'all know a lot about hearing
y'all hear that like the thin laces are
the best high places cuz they lay
flatter and your girl got the pin laces
might you welcome
all right so I've just now laid down
this into part if you can find a lace um
let me know all right let me not get us
myself in this video
I was honestly jamming before come I
came back on this video thing like I was
jamming to it music new stuff so like
I'm gonna go ahead and wipe this off
gonna be taking my wake up wipe to just
whip up these little white dots and
stuff I'm gonna go ahead and go back
with my finger and just push these into
the lace in there I'm gonna take some
more food so I can just stick this part
down
alright I'm gonna go ahead and take the
clip off this honey clip this up and me
down this side
I'm gonna take my makeup like
oh and I also had a lot of inquiries
about this baby air so for the way so
that about this baby here about this
baby or too fresh so for my Witsell all
first five I think I'm gonna be selling
like five weeks so each order is gonna
come with a free tan cap and an edge
brush to brush so yeah this definitely
something to look forward to
all right so that's going to be my first
little baby here and then I'm gonna take
my another snore and basically just go
over there just to give it a more
trainable
and that is the first time
so these are the baby hair that up can
