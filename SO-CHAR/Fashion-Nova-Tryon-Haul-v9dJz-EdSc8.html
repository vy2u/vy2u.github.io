today I'm going to be doing a small haul
and this is for fashion over this is
actually my first time ever ordering
anything for messin over I just really
wanted to see what the hype was all
about and now that I've gotten
experience I mean they are pretty all
that but I'm just going to show you a
few things that I got and then I'm also
gonna insert them in so the first thing
I got was this two-piece outfit
luckily for me I lost the paper with the
things on it but my tag is still on it
so I got this two-piece set and this is
the top right here it's just a little
black top and on the side to see through
I actually show you a picture of me or a
video of me in it so you can get a
better understanding but this is the top
and the top was actually $34.99 and if
I'm not mistaken I think the bottoms
were cheaper but I ripped the tag off
and these are the bottoms it just feels
like ass pants I don't know if you guys
have heard about my like ready popular
and it comes down to the bottom and it
also is a wide leg and it has like this
little detailing that matches the other
part of it to talk to it and the sides
are also like clear see-through so no
underwear boobies alright and then the
next thing I have is just this little
top right here this is also a two-piece
I got two two-piece outfits I love two
pieces um this is like this and it's in
black and I actually got those two in a
size medium and I accidentally got these
in a large which I'm super regret the
tags not on it but I'll just down all
the prices in the links if they're still
there online I mean in the description
box so this is it it'll mean I think
it's best if you wear this you don't
wear this with a bra as you can see I
didn't have on a bra and it just has a
little bit of cleavage in the middle and
this little tie knot in the front and
the bottoms basically mesh of course has
like the same type of textured stripe
not striped but like these line pattern
textures and the bottoms are also the
bell bottoms which I love these pants I
wish I got home in a size smaller but
they still work for my booty
and that's the outfit the next thing I
got was not a two-piece outfit just
these bell-bottom pants up totally love
these like these pants are like made for
giving you a booty um even though me I'm
getting a lot of weight over the past
few weeks and all that but they're also
bell-bottoms - I just paired it with
like a number black shirt but these are
the only I didn't get a matching shirt
first I did just basically bring out my
own crop top that I already had and
those are the pants I also like nice
down below and lastly what I got I kind
of made this an outfit but it's not
really an outfit I just got this really
cute shirt I seen actually I've seen
miracle walks away the shirt and you
know the shirt is kind of trending right
now at first I thought it was so ugly on
but I actually wore it and I swear like
a - brought my boots in little pointy
and it actually looked pretty good so as
you can see when I'm wearing it it looks
really good so I'm definitely going to
wear this out soon and this shirt was
2299 2299 for this shirt and you need to
iron is when it comes in the mail it
comes and melt wrinkly as iron it
please iron it but that's the shirt and
I just paired it with these high-waisted
pants I actually did pop off the tag for
these pants but these pants I got them
in a size 11 everybody's been talking
about the high professional pants and
they're just skinnies you'll see me wear
it when I wear it with the blue top but
on everybody talks about all these pants
are everything in the whole wide world
and I personally feel like there's some
normal high waisted pants I should have
tried out different jeans but seeing how
you guys went to this video let me know
if you want me to do another haul
because I'll definitely go back and get
some more stuff because there's a bunch
of cute stuff that I want to order I
know it's like I hate when this happens
so if you guys want me to do another
video on it please or another fashion
overhaul Tryon home let me know again
and I will be coming to you guys soon
with a new video on me making a lace wig
so get ready for that thumbs up this
video and you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
