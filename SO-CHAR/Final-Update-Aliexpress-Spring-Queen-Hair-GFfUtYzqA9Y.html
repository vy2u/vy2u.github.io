today's video is going to be my final
review on this Aliexpress Queen spring
hair 22 24 and 26 inch so I did I know
I've already did an unboxing video I
didn't still install video and I did
it's a week update and I actually this
hair was originally black and I actually
just dyed it I bleached it when I first
installed it I bleached it and I was
giving like a punish color I actually
insert a picture right here what it was
and then I ended up curling it and
putting some long curls in it which
we're very very pretty and I actually do
have a video on how I got that look and
here's a picture right here of the Wong
curls right and then I also was after
that I think after 2 or 3 weeks
I took the hair out and I bleached it
some more to get it lighter and then I
dyed it and I dyed it using the color
cherry cola I don't know how but I guess
I didn't bleach it light enough but this
is the color I ended up getting I mean I
can't really give you guys like a full
actual color on what this hair is
because sometimes it comes off as a
burnt orange but in certain Lighting's
it'll come off and be a little bit as
like a strawberry shortcake pika just
pink --is-- look as if right now it
looks like a burnt orange to me but this
color just does what it wants different
filters are change it I have like
another filter on my um thumbnail for
the other video and it's actually like
orange looking so this is actually the
hair I can't say this is an actual color
because I'm still confused by this color
it changes all the time so
what I'll say about this hair is what
I'll say about this hair is that I
definitely out of a 1 to 10 I'd give
this hair probably an eight or nine
other L Express hairs that I've had you
know like I've had straight hair before
and they just don't come out this good
like it doesn't
after you bleach hair I like it usually
gets a little bit dry and the ends will
be like you know dry and frowzy and
looking horrible but with this hair it
still looks nice and silky and it's very
silky and I've actually already bleached
and twice which is actually supposed to
really damage the hair but with good
conditioning and treating your hair
really really nice and that's your long
way so I'd say that I've had this hair
for a month now
and I think I mean I haven't ordered a
new hair so I'm gonna continue to wear
it so I changed the style of that first
I had in the middle part snap to the
middle part it was a little part with
straight hair and then after that I just
put some walk girls in it but I actually
took it out this time and um restyled
and pregnant to the side I usually don't
do side parts because I personally feel
like I look really young but I actually
like how this side part came out and
yeah I'm feeling the hair what I would
say about the hair is that rarely get
any shedding it barely sheds on me I
can't say there's anything I don't like
about the hair beside mean I think like
sometimes I put on my satin cap I stuff
like slide in and all that and come go
couple hours and then put on my satin
cap and after that like I'll take it out
and it'll have like waves in it but I
mean I guess that's from me personally
cuz I can go like the whole day without
flooding my hair and it'll stay nice
sometimes I really don't even need a
double flower in it I did doubles like I
just learned it today just so like I can
present it to you and it looks extra
nice but um besides that you barely
really have a fire in it unless you like
your hair bone straight which I do so
that's why I was flaring it I don't put
too much heat to it but I put a lot of
heat to it and it manages pretty well
there's like barely any
some strands in my brush if you can see
them but I can just brush this hair like
all day long and it doesn't shed
nothing nothing gonna stream no no it's
nothing nice and it's nice and floating
you can I can like run my hands through
it all day nice flowy wavy it's just
pretty it's really good here like I know
a girl come it's not one of my videos I
was like oh someone tell me they got in
those bad hair and I mean I don't know
what they did to your set like everybody
everyone orders hair you know whether
you're contacting the you should it's
best to contact the seller and like make
it seem like you have had good hair
before and you know what you're talking
about so they don't give you trash hair
and I mean I always message them and be
like hey I'm used to brand I plan on
doing the review on this video so I mean
a review on this hair so I hope it's
great so I can give you a good review
and usually they send me like good hair
like I usually always get good hair and
when I let them know that I'm gonna do a
review on this hair so I guess that's
what you have to do I mean to get some
good hair sometimes I don't I don't know
but overall I did let the vendor know I
would be youtuber and stuff like that
and I don't know if that's why my hair
came out better than the other girls
hair or is it because I treat mine's
different everyone was different with
her hair and everyone manages them here
different she probably just slept on it
she I deep condition my hair and I deep
condition it with eyes like I do it I do
a whole lots in my hair so maybe
sometimes it's not the vendor it could
be possibly the way that you treat the
hair but for me I give this hair
probably like a 9 or 10 like this I
don't have anything bad to say about
there even though I cut the website
since I reinstalled it I cut the lips
like war I cut the lips the first time I
did it since the second time I cut it
like I cut them again sort of hearts
didn't match so I cut them again and
it's still like barely any shedding this
hair is it's pretty good as great
be great but it's pretty good to me and
it looks good to me it still has luster
and shine and it's bouncy it's not stiff
or anything like that you can run your
hands to it at any time and it your
hands go through like I can lay down in
bed for a little bit you know just you
know like I could just mess it up and
this one it looks like I'm gonna do is
just give it a little more run through
like I'd be having issues where I'd just
be standing in I'll just be going
through my hair when I make my video and
I just beat all up in the camera like
huh and stuff like that somewhere what
happened I'm trying to get out to like
when I make them want to make my videos
I'll be sitting there running my hands
to my hair and stuff but yeah so this is
gonna be my final review on the hair and
to me I've seen the hands about a minor
it's in I bleached it twice died at once
reinstalled it twice had it for over a
month and it still looks great I'll
still be able to use it again it's some
good hair and yeah that's all for this
hair and let me see ah my subscribers
also uh like I'm at 100 in like you know
I'm like at 142 I'm just so happy like
I'm not a lot like I know it's so small
like I said in my last video but like I
really do appreciate all my new
subscribers and all people that are
clicking and watching my video like I
really really do I'm really really happy
about how it's growing it's growing
really slow but I mean you start from
somewhere and you build up so thank you
guys so much for watching and thank you
guys for coming out my video thank you
guys for like subscribing to me and for
those that comment on my videos and let
me know they love this or they love that
your stuff like that I really do
appreciate it and thanks for those that
actually tell me like oh you should do
this next and they're like I like I'll
take all advice like all advices welcome
I mean I mean starting advice is not
always welcome like if you're telling me
how I should do this like oh like if you
telling me only if you should do this
that way or something that unless it's
like to help me well it probably still
you know what I'll just say
I like I appreciate all the positive
comments that I'm getting and for those
that are telling me you know maybe you
should do a smoky eye video and stuff
like that like asking requesting me to
do things like you guys keep it up and
keep requesting and I'll keep bringing
you as much as I can I might do have
something I did try to record this look
but I'm gonna try to look work over my
camera this is my camera I got it on the
tripod right now I've been trying to
record with this camera but I'm kind of
like so damn confused because I could've
sworn I couldn't recording like I
recorded like my half face and then I
stopped it I've got up to go get some
eyelash glue when I came back I started
doing my face and I forgot to click it
so I got up and click and just did
everything over and then when I came
back around in the video nothing was
recording so like okay then I guess I
can't post this video but I will
definitely be trying to do more makeup
videos and I see that you guys are
mostly interested in hair videos and
hauls so I'll definitely bring you guys
more hauls in hair videos so I mean
that's all for today
thumbs up on this hair if you'd actually
really itching some hair and it's all
for a good price shipping is fast
I think shipping was like in four days
for me and the hair came ups like 130 s
or 140 s in that area and once again I
have a 22 24 and 26 other people be
trying to charge like 300 for that and I
mean you can get it for Aliexpress and
get some good quality here for Less so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
