full bouncy warm pros with the long
paper first thing I want to be doing
right now
it's just list written here a little bit
with some lime soup
I know why I focus mainly learning but I
love the way it makes my hair smell and
feel it kind of give it like a nice
shine in the luster to it to use it on
basically a GI independent micro biota
so one of the difference first is a good
little peak unit and to the other pieces
please fine put this parts of the way
and if you thought you're wondering
about that hair this is here from
Austria your company on Aliexpress and I
wear a 360 console and only two bundles
so I'm going to be using this perfectly
long cursor
this is just a regular Locker like our
internet project it was only about from
the like twenty to twenty to thirty
dollars
it's definitely not for you so the first
thing you will do is wrap it in with
this prep event to hold this here now
told that movement if you don't wanna
know the rest of we will apply that you
f it is going to hold this and I wanted
a you can hold it for a few seconds or
so I have to all the weight turns up to
450 also and I want to drop it in there
and hopefully let it cool off a little
and just give it a little stretch I will
set up so that's one walk
I must do a couple more and then I'm
just going to beautiful to a kind of get
now just a couple of other little string
back this year we have old this part of
a bigger jump to go home today

GARP this part and you kind of want to
twist a year or two so a bit like a
spiral and there might be no holes for a
few sometimes to come to call me right
now I'm just going to go ahead and pour
in some part and just stuff it here
magic different part
I'm gonna flip over good part Oh
pull it like that and then basically
that's what your just keep on doing
all right so now that I've drawn this
