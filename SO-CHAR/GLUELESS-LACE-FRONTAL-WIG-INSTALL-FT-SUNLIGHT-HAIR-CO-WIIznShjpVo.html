even when you you're not with me she's
having chili shooter Terry I'll be
damned if y'all get married
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be showing you guys
how I install my lace wig glueless in a
dress
so most of you guys probably already
know I'm sure you know about this book
this yes this has got to be glue I first
started off using the black one but this
one right here the best room so I'm
gonna show you guys how I install my wig
and everybody likes to kind of call this
glueless because it's not used with
really school and this is technically
gel but it is a tight hold like it's a
real tight gel so well alright it's dam
is really slight it's really like nobody
holds down money so this is what we'll
be using alright so this is what you
need and also some gorilla snot don't
forget about showing too much
the first thing I'm gonna be using is
the got to be glue and I'm gonna I use
my finger and also you guys need you one
of these little mesh cap things let me
tell you about this place I'm not gonna
I've seen people use it but the way this
like if your lace is nice Bleeker feet
and you just got some great fall back
this right here it's gonna literally
blend the lace so perfectly like it's
unbelievable so I use only a little bit
to a little bit and
going to go like this you know put it
right before my hairline
I only used one layer and I do it very
very thin leap across so just like this
real thin and if you can see it's kind
of uneven why it's like tannish and it's
tense because of my makeup the
foundation so and it's okay if you get a
little bit on the net this is like
looking at like you can always reuse
this and wash it and it's literally only
$1 so even if you do end up messing it
up some just right there PC aside yeah
honestly all I'm gonna be woman is lace
wigs changed my life for the better I
can't tell you the last time I needed to
permit my hair my leave out like last
time I friend my leave over what they go
just these my hair don't leave braids
and then he goes and braids comes out
grades get wash you gets put right back
in some very sleep thank you for these
wigs
all right so this is what it looks like
and I only some people might put more
layers but the way I work is I put my
lace sleeves on and at the end of the
day I take it off so one layer for me
hold it perfectly fine here's the thing
that a lot of people do not know when
you're blow-drying you can always just
walk around and do other things but a
faster ways to just build right I will
try
a little garlic cold and everything
stays calm this way because when you
look around with cold air it actually
starts drying in when you do it with hot
hair it's really like melting it and
it's just really getting it more sticky
so
and every now and then while you build
right you just touch it and see how it's
getting as you can see it's gotten
clearer and that's the go-to so when
it's just about getting cleaner and less
white then it's ready I'm going to go
over it a little bit more just to make
sure it's fully dry couldn't sometimes
when you do a light and it's still wet
it goes through the lace all right I'm
going to pitch on my way so this is
knowing that I mean it is Elise frontal
weak and this hair is from I'm just
getting some of my hair company on a big
spread and I'm wearing 220 for a 22 and
a 20 inch base facility if I said the
numbers wrong I'll definitely leave
everything linked down below and I also
bent down the video of me bleaching this
run so showing you how it's done
and also my install video on it so this
is what it looks like you might have a
little bit of residue from me using it
before I'm going to do like if I wear it
throughout the whole week at the end of
the week I'll probably washed it and the
back is just this I don't feel my look
every time I make my wigs they come out
pretty tight so I don't feel the need to
do the elastic band thing I haven't
tried it out yet but when I do try it
out I'll definitely let you guys know so
you take it like this drop it on top put
it to the bed and hear me I'm here to
see you make sure it's
it is time to wash it though so I just
go ahead and connect it to this bird
press that thing down it's a little bit
up to the front of my head and you want
to just press it and push it down you
wanna give me simple grab this side and
pull it all right no everything is them
I know right I just went from my zero to
a hundred like it's my Dominican shot
over here now our lake which would mean
to say my hair anyways so alright so now
I'm just going to go in with the blow
dryer again
all right so this is what it looks like
on I'm probably going to where it's at
this side which I usually do target I'm
just gonna like I'm not gonna be like a
strict part with a colon be like just a
little natural part kind of like this
and basically I'm gonna write up a
little bit to get a little juice a juice
okay and this is just a water to leap to
bits
Oh consider surely really nigga
Oh commissioner yeah and a little bit of
a little bit over but it's like oh I
know biosilk it's my kind of frustrating
here but I'm the one that makes my when
you feel like this is Sookie I'm just
going to toss something back like this
now we're going to lay the baby British
Oh JA gorilla schnapps
um this lace frontal does have date oh
my God look it is this I'm going this
one I've never gotten into this pot I
usually hide it like the toothpaste kind
of bottle but this is really like gooey
like so much slime just cool take a tad
bit with a toothbrush Oh with this this
is not a new toothbrush you know I had
to wash my sins brush like I literally
have to let that listen my toothbrush
before my to gosh was going through it I
had to wash it but I think so for a day
so let's see I want to do too much baby
hairs because I like what it's like
kinda like no not too much big ears
I don't know I need I've eaten not
taught school alright it's really hard
to do this and holders here I just hope
that came out right right me I can't see
how her glasses all right so I'm just
gonna leave like this and just put baby
