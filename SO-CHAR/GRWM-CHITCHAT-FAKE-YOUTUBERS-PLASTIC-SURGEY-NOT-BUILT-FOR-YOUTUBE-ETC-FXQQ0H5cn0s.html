kind of looks like I don't have on any
top under this but I definitely have on
a bralette anyways um today I'm just
gonna be doing a chit chat get ready
with me I know I talk a whole lot but
I'm gonna try to talk fast and
everything so basically I'm gonna get
them into hair and makeup but I've
already done my eyes and everything like
that so I'm just going to be doing my
foundation and yeah basically my
foundation key I responded anyways um
you will be making any own appointments
with me then you so cut it out anyways
um yes I'll be doing no chitchat you
ready with me I've already done my eyes
and um I am wearing my lashes these are
in the style Chanel and these are
available on the website the link will
be down in the description box below and
um yeah I didn't want eyeliner super
thick today I don't know why but I
couldn't get it done nicely so I just
did it they can call it a day but I
brother redone and I did a little eye
shadow I do the same look almost like
every day so that's that look I'm gonna
start by getting my foundation this is
the foundation that I use and this is
bare minerals this is the bare minerals
bare Pro performance wear liquid
foundation so I did some parts on my
thing and I'm just going to be getting
my blending bun bloody butter then
Beauty Blender this is a real beauty
blender so none like the other it is
nicely in a damp and I'm just going to
start blending this on my face so I have
like a couple of topics I'm gonna talk
about on my channel so where do I begin
all right that's one conversation I want
to have is about oh and by the way this
foundation is really read on me but I
really like it and it's
built-in as soon as I like highlight
know that it's gonna melt being really
nice I mean nobody telling me this is
not my tone it's too much for me I like
it and that's what really matters
anyways though I wonder for my tone
change looking the last couple of days I
don't know
alright one of the topics I wanted to
talk about was ah youtuber is using
other youtubers names for views and
stuff like that link I'm not gonna
mention no names and stuff like that but
I think it's so corny
and so lame when other youtubers try to
insert another youtubers name just to
get clout and something that like one
person girls not to use is Alli AJ like
everyone has like everyone always
exposing Leah J this about leader J like
I have never seen a Leah J caption not
one of her videos I've been following
their J for the longest time I've never
seen her caption mmm no one of her
videos with another youtubers name like
trying to get clown off that you should
be like I don't see why you guys like or
not even just for like followers books
reviews as well it's like what do you
what do you think you're gaining out of
talking about on another subscriber like
another stream another youtuber like I
think that she is so bad my channel is
now alright for the K and I have never
done one video like disgusting another
youtuber talking down yet another
youtuber spilling tea on another YouTube
like y'all have to leave that for
all tea all shade and trusty TV like
that's who that goes to like those
channels are made to like spill tea
spell gossip and talk about other
youtubers like that's what their
channels made up you can't be a beauty
channel or vlogging channel trying to do
your own thing and at the same time get
caught for somebody else like that
is name you know put in the work that
they put in to get where they at and
maybe you'll be talked about versus
you're talking about them that's like
one of the main things I see a lot on
YouTube right that is so
bitches love talking about leachate like
bitches so single you jay-z's her boats
faker that like what difference does
that make in your life like how much
money do you make off of talking about
Lea J because I ain't gonna lie 13,000
views um
20,000 views where her name in it like
that really don't do much for you it's
not that you have to use somebody else's
need to make money like or to try and
make money like it's weird you girls
just need to work harder and wait and be
patient and maybe your time will come
but talking down on somebody else and
bring you somebody else down that's not
bringing you know it's really not so
well yeah I'm not gonna stay and talk
about this topic so much cuz I don't
really care I mean I care about it but
like it has a happier me and I don't
think I shouldn't happen to me I mind my
business and so should everybody else do
I still look red
I still look super red just dab it oh by
the way I use my like OOP I lose a leg
or apophis Hillier and I use a color tan
I had just might like I like I need to
just omen and I got the MC 45 from Mac
but I don't feel like it gives me a
bread enough highlight as I wanted to I
probably should apply and see 42 for the
Mac girls think they know everything
anyways yeah that's what I'm using right
now to do underneath my eyes another
topic I wanted to talk about was like
plastic surgery and stuff like that
I don't I definitely plan on getting
some let's just call it a hold on video
like I definitely have plans to be doing
that in the soon near future I want to
say maybe in like a couple of months but
I wanted to get your some of your
opinion on it and when I say opinion I
mean not what you think about me doing
what like what you think about what I
should do to my body my opinion is it's
like do you guys want to see me do that
process
that process like do you guys want to go
through it with me basically not should
I do it or should I not because not that
your opinion doesn't matter but it
doesn't matter to what I choose to feel
in my body but if you guys would want to
see that and go to that journey with me
I'm definitely willing to do that and
have that on camera for you guys so yeah
so comment down below if you guys on
just um just don't want to be like you
just be like yes to the PDF journey
right yeah you could just say something
like that and I was like first I was
like nervous about him like Dean do I
want to have this on my channel and it's
like oh I don't think it'll be a big
difference that you guys will be able to
tell like I won't go for my fist to this
cuz I'm already a big girl I just want
to be more curved basically like I'm
gonna have a smaller waist and smaller
tummy and I don't want nobody telling me
like Oh work out just go I want a bigger
bully to like I look my booty is little
like the only reason why my booty looks
the size it does it's cuz I have really
big thighs if I had no ties I'm pretty
sure like if I was skinny look like oh
wow like I think no not even a why I
probably have like a little dick but a
little bit so yeah I'm definitely gonna
be doing it I've already gone over like
a few doctors that I'm gonna go to never
in my life I ever go to talk to my on me
he's not good he's just over height I
don't think mine is good he used to be
alright in the beginning but now he's
just giving everybody walk booties so
that's not for me but I just said doctor
man because I know that I live in Miami
so like you would think that I would go
to that bucket but no um I was thinking
evolution MV MD doctor lipo yeah his net
his real name is Cesar Villa I was
looking into him and his prices are
really okay to is like alright 5500 like
they're in a good range like I could do
we'll look I'm not really too much a fan
of Fisher like I know he's doing the
body all nice and stuff Andrew and
natural-looking which is what I which is
what I want but I personally don't feel
like he's giving enough
like it could be a little bit more ass
given so I have three doctors in mind
dr. Samson dr. lie pole which is Caesar
Villa and I was the third person Oh dr.
Makoto
which is he's on Aventura dr. Cesar
Villa is in Caesars Miramar and Sampson
I think Sampson is in Miami I'm not too
sure but I think he's in Miami so
basically what I did was I've gone
through everybody's real self and I was
like did my little research on them and
whatnot and I'm it's not overall you
know everybody's not gonna be pleased
and there is gonna be some mistakes that
happened only fear I have in this BPL
process it's like there's something that
happens to them where they get burned
and their skin starts to like open like
a a burden wound and I don't know if
that's why I'm not taking care of your
body after you I don't know what it's
from but that's like mainly my biggest
fear of this PPO journey like that's it
and um I mean yeah you have the fear of
what if your body doesn't come out how
you've wanted it to but it's kind of
like on I just personally feel like I
watched these doctors and I know how
they work with certain body types and
body types that are similar to meet mine
so like I kind of see how they sculpt
and make the body and I don't have those
bodies that are like overly bad like
some girls they go get their body and
it's like you know you had no business
getting your body dug down here in Miami
with that body type she had to go to
like you needed to go to Dominican
Republic where because you know D are in
other countries like they don't really
have a limit on how much fat they take
out of your body and like some of these
girls their bodies are night so just
portion so bad I'm not shaming no one's
party but the ones that did go and get
their brights on like it's like it looks
kind of weird and it's just because you
have to look two more rounds like your
body was really from from what you were
going for cuz I look at people's you
know I look at people's was that she
call
real self and I see they put up their
wish pics and stuff in effect with the
body shape that you had and what you
were going for like that's not gonna
happen and just one round like that's
gonna be like you have to go through a
couple a couple round into locust son
enough warming up some I think I have to
get another foundation for the meantime
cuz I think since the world is changing
and it got cool my skin saunders chooses
change stuff for me because oh by the
way i'm using the bare minerals face
powder in the color here's on that
twenty was my foundation in cappuccino
27 oh yeah maybe I should have went
maybe like 226 or so in the foundation
so maybe that's what I'll end up doing
is picking up
picking up a lighter foundation made my
tool but it was yeah so on anyway yeah
so if you guys want to see that video
journey with me I'll be like happy to
share it with you I'm like and I'll used
to over like here another thing like
somebody like sometimes I be snapping
back at some of my subscribers and
sometimes don't even be subscribers so
some of the people that come out my
videos I do on respond to rude people
and stuff like that and some girl one
time I responded to one girl and it was
like oh you can't take criticism get
she's not for you
and it's like no YouTube is for me like
you you don't for one you can't tell
somebody is what is and isn't it for
them if I'm doing something and I'm
doing pretty good at it and it's for me
you're not who are you to basically tell
me like it's not for me so I just might
get that clear there I won't like the
negative comments and stuff like that
that that won't be an issue for me
because I just simply read them in
depending on what mood I'm in if I'm in
uh okay mood mmm I might respond to you
and you know read you and if I'm just
like okay this person has nothing to do
then I'm just simply bit off the channel
and they're not like basically you don't
like me you don't like what I post you
don't like how did this you don't like
whether that's so great you won't ever
see me again
well that's basically Miletich I've seen
posters from people that's been like oh
I went to high school with you I hate
you I'm blocking you and it's like okay
you went to high school with me you were
probably scared of me and it's like go
ahead and block me like you commented to
let me know you blocked me innocent
anonymous page like what do you think
you just did right now
I was really oh and I just conferred
with this oh we really like people be so
bored right people yeah yeah lies you
have to get lies that's just like when
you go on like Instagram and you see
like people come and see under like not
seeing that I'm a celebrity for like you
see people comment like things on the
celebrity pulses and it's just like
would you get out of that like how did
that benefit you just now name what did
you get out of it
that is that is so stupid to
me like you're so dumb I think the
caller started tumbling anymore my chest
looks so light compared to my neck I
shouldn't even have my chest out but it
also looks like makeup because I always
wear shirt sleeves like I don't walk on
my chest oh and something that and
everyone cover up so much chest is
probably lighter than my neck my inner
arms I'm like how you in arms like over
here that's right and in over here I'm
definitely probably gonna end up
hopefully you guys if you guys want it
do not do it if you don't like I really
don't have to share it's not that big of
a deal but you're gonna see these
pictures like I'm doing as a fool all
right after more fashion overalls right
after I'm just gonna be enough like
you're gonna see it regardless for but
it's not I'm just like I'm just saying
cuz it's not a seeker like I don't
really care for who find out about it oh
you know sees it like it's not see
there's something that I've wanted to do
for a while and stuff like that so if
you can afford it and you want it for
yourself I don't why not
yeah that's what I'm gonna be doing it I
want to say like I can't give it a time
date but I know
is it just me or Feliz who never line up
like I don't think it I'm gonna be
taking my it's for BH Cosmetics glamour
brush palette I got this like years ago
when I took a lash number last class
when I took him makeup course for this
lady she gave us two ministers
money just a bunch of cheap that
but it works and I liked it
like cheap stuff is always good as a lot
of people will stop using the B'nai
banana powder but I think I'd automatic
I've had you Lord Merton I'm running out
of My Little Miss here but I've had the
nor Mercier I've had on Sasha Buttercup
and I've also had nor mercy i Sasha
buttercup there's another one
oh that's it Laura Mercier Sasha
Buttercup and so on Bernard but not the
only one when you wipe it off it doesn't
have like oh wait best oh and I also
tried that Walmart one like airbrush
something like that yes airspun that one
I've tried them all but to me the best
one is sown but not the Ben Nye banana
powder this is a naked trio and I really
like this one because I'm it's more
shimmery and glittery like it's more
shimmery glittery you know I just like
to like dab it on right here but it
doesn't like sit on the face says shiny
has the rest of the Cross ones do I
don't know what they do in OT no they
pose a problem now I know what they do
but
they all rub it in like that
like this I don't I don't like that big
too much go look I just like to keep it
cute I love to go to North but I think I
kind of went out of the nose theme using
this big brush and I'll probably just
move right here yeah and I like to give
a little something to musician and a
little something right here just to make
it glitter a little bit yeah so I'm
gonna start on my hair now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
