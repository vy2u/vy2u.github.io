you tie the fraud and I just let the bat
chill because I don't want to come in
and then it it gets I don't want to put
it cold I want to put it in like a
ponytail and it has pointelle dent so I
just let it hang and let it chill I'm
just gonna quickly and just press it off
some right so I don't have my Flatiron
fresh with me but that's fine
this is a little job because it I stayed
it stays bone straight as it is so you
really don't have to do too much to it
take it straight
just pressing it out so pretty I'm gonna
be doing that try pressing it out look
at that amazing sorry and then I'm gonna
take two parts I usually will do one
foot I'm gonna split this up into
and it's like I did dye the hair jet
black so if you went in white so dark
yeah I gotta jet black because I just
wanted it to be jet black car became
like a natural brown color I just wanted
it to be right we'll take the famous how
cool is hot and just press it out anyway

been washed or anything and just
beautiful and now I'm gonna do this side
