wanna be mad at me but I did not record
myself doing this lace down or doing my
baby Harris so the reason why I did not
record it is cuz at first when I do the
lace down when I first um glued it down
I'm sitting like help the lace is
looking like on how I applied it kind of
effect it was scrunch so I was like
there's actually no point of me filming
this because it doesn't look good but as
I continue to do the baby hairs I kind
of ended up liking it but I actually put
too much on this side so I use a little
skin on this side so I said I wasn't
gonna film me putting it on but I
decided I was gonna film me kind of like
laying it down in basically flicking it
out as you can see it's not looking too
good right now it's cute though what is
not compute alright so first things
first is this first things first is this
is hair from amazing hair and I'm
wearing three bundles of 30 inches of
curly hair so yeah it stretches out the
camera it's pretty quickly
pretty patina
it's like I can't wait to get the whole
thing but when I fix it I'll show you
guys but it's some pretty pretty long
I'm really really feeling it so I'm
gonna just adjust the part and
everything how calm it down on the sides
and put my curl in it and basically team
my curls so first thing I also wanted to
mention that this is not no ordinary
front school this is a 13 by 6 front
school which means it's much much longer
like the front who literally goes to the
back over here so it ends like I read
mind that particle ends all the way back
here so yes that's from this run to it's
like off the chain like I can definitely
part it and I just keep parting it like
this is always still all that here is
like all lace even like you're a keeper
it's really yeah easy it's a really
really big like it's huge so I really
have to shove those three bundles and I
was actually supposed to put in four
bundles but I ran out of space so I had
three so first thing I'm gonna be doing
is readjusting my part so I'm just
taking my rat tail comb and I'm just
redoing realigning my part and
everything I I don't know about y'all
but I already have issues with running
my hair straight in the middle
so with this closure actually being
longer it's like way more easier to be
crooked
so no part of too far then I'm gonna
write it just for no you just think
right at this point here maybe I will
just do some talking to make it look
good but this is like these lace
frontals are like four also feel like
people who are people who like their
parts to be like they're really really
far and stuff which I don't actually
mind gonna owe my money
I haven't had curly hair since like you
layer here and I was like three months
ago or maybe even four so this is hair I
think I've already said it when I said
again you amazing hair I have on the
information link down below I love you
amazing hair they actually sent me 30
inches before but the accents inch
straight hair and I was soul and know
what that hair so of course I'm gonna be
in love with this hair as well let me
just come right here right here I need
to make sure that the rice is ready oh
my gosh guys so this is our hair you
ready chitchat cuz I'm gonna be talking
in a like I didn't to tell you guys this
yet but I have like good news
I'm so excited I officially booked my
date for my video so that's what's up
I'm getting a PBL like I was always
procrastinating and saying I'm gonna do
it this day then I'm gonna do with this
this time like in this mod there's a
motto
that months and I just I just said Yolo
and I did it so alright so yeah so I'm
going to be going to magically I
remember oh it's just like I've been
watching like I've been preparing to get
this done for like I've been prepared to
get this done for like the past maybe
I'm gonna say year but so I did like a
whole lot of research on tons and tons
of surgeons and I actually had several
surgeons that I was gonna work with in
the beginning and end up changing them
just you find out things you see things
some little niggas got me down license
suspended but still operating and
you know no names but anyways it just
took me a while to actually feel
comfortable with finding the right
surgeon and just feel comfortable with
who I'm going to choose who I'm gonna
let change my body and mess with my body
so I've decided that I will be pointing
to seduction cosmetic it's in um they're
like three locations once in Aventura
was in Doral and I don't know where the
other one is but I am going to be going
to seduction in subduction cosmetic and
my doctor is going to be jumpy I'm going
with dr. Sun oh I said the wrong
name you know I'm pretty pathetic I'm
going with a doctorate mackadoo
I used to say his name was Makoto but
it's actually McAdoo so yeah I'm going
with dr. Mehta dude and I'm really
really nervous I'm nervous I'm getting
it done I'm just nervous of the outcome
and stuff like that
plus you know I got a big mustache okay
dude
but yeah so I bet and I think that this
is like I'm sorry I was just stuck at
multitasking but I end up talking about
when I do these videos English so I'm
going to be going through McAdoo and
he's a pretty good surgeon I've watched
a lot of his lives he gets on my van
does videos every now and then I watched
like English all of them he also loved
when I catch them because I can't catch
every single that he does and I've seen
I like actually seen some of the girls
that he's done and I put on their
Instagram and they all look really
really good and I've seen actually no
girl who's actually went to him and she
looks amazing as well so I'm like super
excited and I trusted and I've watched
like I'm studied like his real self page
and all that good stuff and I think that
he is gonna he's my one he's the one I
chose and I've heard like I heard
everything overview on his videos ooh I
wanna write stuff like I'm really really
obsessed with him
so I mean you gotta be obsessed with
your surgeon Doug so I got laid down the
top of my head with my house phone and
now I'm just gonna do one side at a time
so you guys can basically see the
difference
all right so the Front's will be so much
shorter than the bundles they need to
make that longer frontal well the long
fronts will only means that the head is
gonna shed like a thousand times more so
now I'm just going to take the ends and
I'm gonna first this is my first time
I'm rushing the hero and I know it's
about to get big
I make blue big hair it's not even funny
I think 30 inches of curly is like the
longest I've ever gone I think the last
year less my god 28 inches I'm gonna be
taking my carrot Kerouac stick and I'm
just going to be wet Oh be front part of
my hair pull up so you can basically see
now I'm just going to be pressing it out
with the heat of my
I know a lot of you guys are gonna stay
like surely your body's fine you don't
need it I just personally want y'all to
keep that to yourselves because my
body's okay it's not like the worst
point in the world and I did that little
blue one on but I don't have any
freaking hips like I have no hits so I
need some hips like I need a flatter
stomach
I'm tired of sucking you for dear life
in the pictures
and over something yet certain or
recipient for dear life in my pitches as
it holds a certain weight I'm gonna pull
it in like any and every position and
look amazing when I get home don't be
telling my mom and so she can't be like
I'm gonna be using the water fine news
or just out with sweet almond oil and
this is by seal and shine polishing this
is like my go-to I'm gonna try more
mooses out cuz I was using this one cuz
I don't give me no issue like I don't
see why wouldn't you know don't fix it
if it ain't broken type of thing but oh
that's you know test out my products I
actually need a commercial today little
secret but probably know about this but
I use Chi in all the brands and I also
and I never buy them at the stores
because it sounds so expensive but you
can get really really great deals at
like Marshalls and I think - yeah TJ
Maxx
- Marshalls and TJ Maxx be happening not
Ross you know Ross that's right
yes so make sure you guys check that
place out you doesn't seems like a whole
almost ten mohs cuz I think the big BIOS
little goals for like $27 the big
milestone and I get it at Marshall's for
about
sixteen another one of my girls who
spreads out all the juices on my curly
hair and this is by on natural in its
premium oil free curling way we curl
defining conditioner in detangler so I'm
just gonna spray that in so keep in mind
that the curl Turner and then I'm
learned is deep waves so it's not gonna
be too curly but more of like a wave
look how about this sprayed like it does
something to the curly and you can see
up like it's already changing the curls
so this is one side so far just bring it
the crows down stop now I'm going to do
I actually don't like when my hair is
like this flat but I like the estimate
the absolute math they're gonna is kind
of kind of like curl the car gonna dry
out more and get bigger so then it means
that we can do this side but anyways
delay he's gonna be calling me back and
giving me like more information and
signing me I think there's like gonna be
like some portal that she's gonna give
me and also basically like test that I
gotta run in all that so I hope you guys
are excited is for my BPL journey I'm
guys are excited as much as I am because
I honestly feel like I just made like a
huge change my life like all the time
like I've been like really really like
fascinating so now I just feel like I
just said I don't say the f-word but I
just said you know budget let's do this
you're not to the step and yeah so I'm
pretty sure like maybe in like the next
when I do like a full in-depth video on
the video I'll probably tell you guys
more information as far as the surgery
or elite surgeon but you know the
pricing of things and dadada right now I
don't really know stuff and I'm gonna be
