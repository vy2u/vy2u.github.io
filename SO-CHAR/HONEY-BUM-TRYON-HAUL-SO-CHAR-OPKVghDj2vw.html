today I'm going to be doing a tutorial
on some tutorial I'm so used to saying
it I'm going to be doing a charm off for
you guys and this is with a big company
honey bum I know you guys heard of this
company a lot this is my first time I'm
working on but they sent me some pieces
well pieces I picked out so I'm gonna
wear them try them on let you guys how I
feel about the clothing you know
basically put y'all on it fits 5/5 it's
not is not and I won't be afraid to say
that so I'm gonna go ahead and start try
them on and let y'all know what I think
I picked out like a bunch of clothes
like look at all this clothes this is a
whole lot of clothes yeah so this is
outfit one and it's just let's keep your
leg it goes all the way down to the
bottom of my leg it's like super
comfortable and I got it in a size large
so I feel like I'm really comfortable in
it it hasn't a whole lot of stretch to
it this is it the next outfit I got is
just this velour jumpsuit and it goes
all the way down to the bottoms
I wish the back would be like a little
bit more Sun in so this is definitely
like an airport type of outfit I'm for
the night Airport you know st. I wanna
get a little bit : this is definitely
like a chill type of outfit it's super
comfortable and it's like a girl we're
gonna work so yeah this is the next
outfit the next up the icon is this
jumpsuit I absolutely love this jumpsuit
and I got this jumpsuit in a size large
as well almost everything I have will be
in a size large play yeah honestly how
is this dumb suit like I'm not gonna
wear this anywhere like other than like
I won't ever wear this to the mall but I
probably will just if I'm going to stop
Beach if I'm home like chilling at home
type of thing I won't ever like wear
this out or you know
anywhere like where we'll be like
writing peopling I'm going to wear this
where I like people are like half dress
in like wearing stuff like this so this
is it new thing the bodysuit Lindsay
everything a large this and also
everything that I have on will be like
listed in the bottom of the video so you
guys can see it'll be in the description
box okay so this next outfit I'm not
really fully too much just because it's
a little too short right here like this
up my crotch and then right here it's
like exposing how the booze and I could
never you know walk around like that but
it is a cute come on here on the
jumpsuit it isn't really cute jumpsuit
and this is what it looks like but I
think I could ever wear this unless this
whole front part it gets like stitched
all the way up cuz it's just really
exposing polities this outfit right here
is actually one of my absolute favorites
I just love this
I still love like you sweat some things
back when I was younger I used to always
give me the vibe of like Sierra which
the screen I love YouTube videos dancing
so this is what the back part looks like
on and I actually love love the space
thing I love it I love it so also this
is in a size large I love this actively
attending I love
if you were to actually look words of
the elderly when we treat you and the
bottles come all the way down to the
ankles as well and this is also through
the wards so yeah and it's also any size
large you guys did nearly the next
outfit is like a little bit similar to
the first outfit I have on except the
bottoms on the arms kind of match the
arms on this it has some scrunch of
thing going on to it to the side or the
back and it is also full or so what
looks like and
to inform i'ma Kalaivani bones quality
of their clothes it's actually really
really good
material and it's made really really
solid so this is the next outfit and
honestly I really really love this
outfit but the bottoms are like
extremely too tight
I'm not gonna spin around and show you
guys the back part because my top of my
butt it's like falling out but this is
the next outfit Tom I also got this in
the large I really should have not just
an extra large because I'd really love
this outfit but it's just that oh how
paulien I'm giving it to with my friends
or something
because I really can't smooth it into it
but it's super to the material on - this
is like a good material but it doesn't
stretch that much so me squeezing into
this is like crazy but yeah this is I
just got this little trance um this
dress is a little bit short but it's
like okay smell it okay if you do wear
the dress you cannot wear it with a bra
or it'll show up in the back of your
dress but yeah I know this is it's
actually a bit comfortable take off my
bra to wear it so you guys could
actually see it but yeah super
comfortable in a size large were cute
and lastly I just got this Jean Jackie
it's like really distressed on the arms
and nice I love it in the pet is a
little bit distressed to show you guys
but we need to stress going out in the
more science but I love this jacket when
I wear I'm gonna wear like something
like off the shoulder maybe like put in
this and happy like showing off my
shoulder and like a grungy look like
something like this like in a way even a
little bit like more different right
this way like something like this skin
type of thing this is how I think I've
been up wearing it I don't know like I'm
gonna wear in a function style like
that's my more so yeah alright guys so
this is the end of the Vittorio I hope
that this was helpful for you and
