brush my hair every morning before I put
any water or anything like that I just
feel like that keeps the hair detangled
and you get a better look with your
curls alright guys so
this is what my curly hair is looking
like right now as you got to see last
night I didn't brush it I just want to
sleep with it how it was

like look at it now I'm just going to
run my fingers through I'm just going to
get a spray bottle I just put a little
bit of conditioner in this red bottle
and a whole lot of water and I'm just
going to spray it out doesn't really
spray out too much it sprays out just
enough but not too much I'm going to
just keep on praying and it's right
inside
I think it the inside I want it to be
too wet or to be too flat so let me just
bit it
like this and then I'm just going to rub
my hands do it and just turn the cross
on you did you guys can see the curls
are starting to form all right so I'm
now drenched out this side and just let
the curls fall a bit more love it like
so many people I forgive my since I've
had this hair and I've gotten like so
many compliments and so many people have
asked me what kind of hair this is and
I'm like oh it's deep curly but then you
know you got to add in like SD clothes
for me like not everybody's speaker like
this so yeah so what's up somebody's
feet curly and they get some curly
hair and it's not like this and that's
not even a person that's really really
for like the curls but I just like I
like I like deeply more than I like deep
curly but wanted Carly's the - force

get me through this though and this is
all just based off of water in

this that's on my hand and I got some
hairs you guys will see it I got some
hands on this hand it's just this kind
of Hiromi though like my hair is trying
to dried up something I've gotten bigger
I kind of liked it when it was like you

just think they're kind of lucky like
