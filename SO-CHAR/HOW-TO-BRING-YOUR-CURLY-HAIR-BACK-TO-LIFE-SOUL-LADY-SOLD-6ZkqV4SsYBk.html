stomach
yeah I just started like I literally
never put it for 20-30 seconds to make
it yeah
don't talk about my Nations like I'm
Haitian Wow this nigga set of pair of
jeans I'm dead to of month corner you
don't know there was Haitian and I he
just said chou-heung go I'm dead
this is stupid alright so oh sorry
myself sort of Jean alright so today I'm
going to be basically a hair right on
the lip and I'm um I have a Mac lip
gloss so you know Mac lip gloss is like
so it looks right no I look good if
anything I just want it down alright so
basically today I'm going to be showing
you guys how I basically revamp my crazy
hair so right now the front of my hair
is looking super fried I don't have it
blended in I didn't cut
my cat so you can probably see my cap do
lace I'm like looking a hundred percent
a mess but we're definitely got to
change that so quick little details on
this hair this hair is from soul lady
hair and this was a Brazilian deep way I
did bleach it and color it I have a
tutorial on that so I'll have that link
down below and I'm wearing at wage
frontal and the bundles are 22 of 20 22
24 26 mm actually I think it's a 20 inch
front or 24 or 26 in a 28 whatever it is
I'll definitely have a link down below
and I'm gonna basically guys bring that
miss Wickfield and also this wig is
going on sale as of today it's going on
sale for 150 I'm gonna be taking it off
and washing it and whoever wants it I
will ship it out to you for 150 so feel
free to email me
yeah Charlie and although I'm not
shaving forever at gmail.com and you
must have cash F because I don't do
PayPal if I'll be trying to hold my
money to like 14 days and I cannot so
anyways I was gonna record this video
for y'all yesterday but my makeup came
out so bad yesterday so I couldn't post
this so I remade it today which I'm kind
of feeling this I did definitely forget
to have like my brows you win some
anyways the front of my lace is lifted
up so it's ready to come off I'm not
gonna be renewing it cuz I'm gonna put
too much bone in it not to clean it off
so I haven't open this little bugger
right now I just ain't even a 360 you
feel me it might be put my hair up like
is some type of for lace what is really
a French little bundles but if you
watched my way to Torres you could get
my news and I have already know if you
guys are wondering hopefully or not
maybe I order but I'm wearing a
fashionable one piece right now and
I'm gonna be doing a fashionable chop
off you guys I bought a bunch of stuff
from fashion over within a couple of
days so yeah so right now this is what
the hair looks like I didn't know
something y'all when I first make this
video that I wasn't really feeling the
hair but now that is here and I've
gotten used to it for couple days down I
don't want to be loved the color like
it's it's pretty it's pretty but no just
some gold here I'm gonna um just brush
it out right now
it's like tingly and stuff I just
literally came up when I got off for a
kiss today I was so tired I didn't brush
it out and do nothing
Wow all right so I'm gonna start to
brush eat
you
I don't know what to do I'm gonna take
this you can't in class I'm right here
on one side
you
I kind of wanted to do like a tutorial
stuff for you guys but I can't really
think that nothing to do with this curly
hair and the stuff that I want to do I'm
definitely about to do that with some
straight hair after I get my lazy ass
okay finished making that wig I love
this here this here is I have we heard
like a love and hate relationship
because when I first did it our first
idea the curl pattern
I lost cuz this is like a deep lake but
the curls I guess all of that processing
it really dropped the curls so when I
neither sneeze okay I always back on
bless me I know I sneeze weird but my
mom's even worse but my mom she'd be
like yes sneeze
alright so like I was saying I was
struggling with finding something to
really bring the curls out so I would
seem to be stressed or I mean we said
coming to Walmart and I was just
spraying it down with water because
that's what deep courier that's usually
what she has no water conditioner but
for me everything it really wasn't
working and I even bought this little
thing right here which is like curly
kids it's like a hair detangler I
brought that but it really wasn't doing
nothing but detangling the hair so I
went ahead and went back to the store
and I was just spraying a little things
on the ends of my hair and this one
ended up working really really good for
me and this is the Garnier Fructis style
curl renew which is a reactivating milk
spray what all right so this is will
regulate the hair finally give me some
curls so I'm gonna go ahead and be
taking
and spraying it down I wanted to use
water but I don't want it to get too
damp because when this head is wet it
gets like really really flat and I'm
gonna be bad water but not yeah I'm
gonna be out of water but it's like as
you can see on a spring it's like
literally already starting to like curl
up and get really pretty so I just
opened the hair and sprayed it through
missing this looks great is this cuz I
don't curse no more my channel
well I'm trying not to curse anymore my
channel I got a lot of kids that
probably watched me and adults and stuff
like that so I'm going to try to be more
mindful of my language here the kids
that watch this is just some water just
to get her going here going so as you
can see you know like I'm able to just
run my fingers like straight through the
hair because it's been cleaned out and
brushed out and all the curls and knots
and then you know touched and also don't
forget about the ears because I feel
like ends are so important I hate seeing
girls I was gonna say be be ITC ages or
bi TCH s whatever I hate seeing no beep
I see th in that order I hate seeing
them girls what they is like all
frightened stuff like baby ends be
looking like the back of the neck area
and I can't even tell just about the
back of my neck area is 106 right look
at that like you see that difference
right there
alright so now I'm about to take this
side I reckon I'm gonna be some curly
hair I feel like it brings out my inner
Amy could you realize how many
have this year but it just don't be like
this nothing about the courier you know
I've been trying to put on this front
with curly Harrison played my middle
school days with weight
like most people didn't what they went
and wavy
cuz I mean some you will do something
you go I went that way way they make
that tough to get I like that creepy
look you know what I was just watching
this gonna do it my hair
oh boy should be look it's on my baby so
long I talk so much I'm gonna go ahead
and now touch up my baby hairs cuz you
know they look in buzz I'm taking my
gossipy clue I don't usually use got to
be blue on my head but since I moved
into the shop I had to kind of started
to read up on my to of everything so my
gorillas smart it's over there
but I got two of these that's why I'm
able to have some of that cuz that's a
shot too and I have to squeeze out this
one if you guys are wondering I'm using
the little one
a lot of you guys were asking me about
that wax sticks that I've been using on
my head and I know I said it what it was
in the video but okay I'm wearing I'm
using the Carol I know yeah I know I
told job because I told you about the
price on it in how much on whatever it's
made me so I started with it so for
those who don't really watch my videos
but we want to know the T if you just
watch my videos you'll know what it is
instead of trying to skim through it
anyways it's some the karekare wax stick
like I'm not and I get I get a lot of
questions on it and I'm not even it's
not like I'm trying to hold back on T
here T and stuff like that it's just the
fact that I said it and I sold like a
whole little mini story - it's too late
I don't feel like I should repeat myself
for those people really don't watch me
but if you don't watch him like that and
you did X I mean you're watching this
part it's the care hair care wax stick
I've definitely gotten way lighter on my
baby hairs I don't know why it's just I
don't know like when you first start
doing something you just start improving
yourself in it I saw joy in okay I know
I saw joy because it's not I'm not I
know I showed it but this is the wax
stick I use this wax P everyday because
this is the whole girl this dummy no
push back get back

and I definitely wanted to come up with
a remover and be like more bigger and
more perfect so I'm just gonna write
some with my blow dryer and I'm going to
dry it on cool I don't know why cuz I
had a blue bottle of glue over here but
