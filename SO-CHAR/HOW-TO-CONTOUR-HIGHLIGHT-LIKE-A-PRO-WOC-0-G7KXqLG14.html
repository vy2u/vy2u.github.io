the first thing I'm gonna be starting
off with is my foundation so I have
bought this foundation yesterday I
purchased this foundation from Mac um I
got it was called NW 50 I used to use NW
v ah this is any of you 47
I used to use NC 50 but I kind of like
the warmer foundations on my skin I
don't know I just kind of like that
hammer look I think it's gonna be a
little too light for me my skin tone is
like really changing right now because
down in Miami it's really really cold or
it's not really really cool but it's
cold and the Sun go out that much but as
you can see like on the top of my brows
I use the NC 50 a 47 so I know offer it
that it's gonna be too light so I'm
going to be mixing my bare minerals bare
Pro Foundation and this is in the shade
cappuccino 27 and I think that this
foundation is overall too dark for me
but with this mixed in with got it over
here mixed in with the Mac I'm pretty
sure that I'll get the color that I was
actually going for I'm just gonna be
taking it and just swiping it through my
face this one is super reddish and it
shows up like beyond red until I finally
yeah this one is darker but hopefully
both of them combined I just like the
reddish undertone
all right
and also I usually sometimes moisturize
my face but I have super super oily skin
and I'm not trying to do that today I'm
going to be spraying my face with the
Mario Badescu skincare it's called the
facial spray with aloe herbs and
rosewater
I'm pretty sure you guys heard about
this so I'll be spraying my face with
this if you guys also are wondering
about my what the heck if you guys are
also wondering about my eye lashes I am
wearing the lashes in the style Chanel
so make sure you check out my website
and get you up here so now I'm taking my
damp Beauty Blender and I'm just dabbing
it into my no don't forget to get your
lower leg also this hair is from March
clean here I'll have the details on this
here and listen down below I've already
done an install video on that so if you
guys didn't see it be sure to check it
out
check it out and I'm not gonna be
wearing too much foundation I want it to
be I don't say light but not too heavy
on my skin but this should do make sure
I didn't miss any spots
all right
I'm gonna use this product just to get
into the inner cutters and in this
corner my brow
alright so now I'm going to be taking my
concealer and I like to use cool tan in
the Pro Longwear concealer that's always
been like it's been my concern for the
longest I did try Mac concealer I can't
find Deacon still there but nothing and
you know what these used to be like
$1.99 any of the prices now since
they're so popular
some places sell for dollar some places
settle for two and it's just like cut it
out like these were only $1.99 so I'm
going to be taking cool tan and I like
this do it like this I'll make my eyes
I think I used too much on the side
how can he rise in everything
you know I love it and I'm going to do
right here and I'm going to be doing
right here so I do not um I do not color
I don't cream contour but I do cream
highlight all right so now I'm just
going to be taking my spray and I'm
going to spread my piece so I can get a
little luster st. Mario Badescu spray I
know I'm gonna be taking my Beauty
Blender and I'm just going to be tapping
it in I'm getting out my chin
imagine I take some product from our
eyes I've already mentioned
you
all right so I think I highlighted air
all the areas that I want to be
highlighted right now this is what's
underneath my eyes look like and I'm
going to now sit underneath my eyes and
I'm going to be setting the underneath
my eyes with the benaiah banana powder
I've been using this powder for like
years
I used the night I was gonna fresh him
off he knows the first daughter Ashley
the first baking powder cause I read
baking powder but that was a fresh face
powder head and then I had the next
thing I know with social butter cups
then I had one and then I heard I always
wanted to try the Kat Von D's one so I'm
gonna basically try it and then after
that I had the camera member over the
laura mercier and home the little
Mercier is actually pretty good
minimum flashbangs if you take your time
in like dust it off so this is what it
look like
like a white pound cake and the meantime
of this baking I'm going to go ahead and
put on my foundation powder and set my
foundation I will be setting my
foundation with the bare minerals
foundation I'm making powder and this is
the color hazelnut as you can see like
this is my this is on the face powder I
use on my face as of right now so that
 is like it's not even hand pan like
it's past hitting pan but I'm gonna be
using this to basically set
my furnish
the older I get the more I'm starting to
be like way more photogenic Mike look
how good this picture came out all right
so now the next thing that I'm going to
be doing sorry I'm feeling myself I love
baking like I feel like I look so good
I'm making but this how could work my
makeup I would okay so now the next
thing that I'm going to be doing is
contouring we're going to be using my
air out my black radiance true
complexioned contour planet planet
contour palette in the color medium to
dark and I just take my little angled
makeup brush and I'm just going to work
it right here and I do let the powder
sit on my face
I also had to bring it into right here
when I do this I don't double dab it I
just use the residue that on here
all better and then I'm going to be
doing the total forehead I also just
used the residue I don't want it to be
too heavy and then I kind of bring it in
my forehead just to get smaller illusion
and now I want to take some more powder
all right so now the sides of my face
because I don't contour my nose with the
same
I don't cost much I do not color my face
with the same contour palette that I
used to contour my nose I'm going to be
using the semi-sweet chocolate bar by
Too Faced and I'm gonna be using the
color truffled to line up my nose this
is just the preference of my and this
part is very very very very scary
people be doing a knows way too skinny
and I just want to mine I'm just gonna
be dusting this off
you
now I'm gonna show you my blush in my
lighter and that's it
what I'm gonna be using is the Barrett
BH Cosmetics palette and this is the
glamour brush it comes with ten
different shades one of them fill out
what I'm going to be using all of these
they're like another I'm gonna use this
but they often fall out is to like red
I'm going to be using these peachy
colors
I'm wrecking like I'm in love with plush
like I don't really like to highlight my
face so I'm gonna be just doing my nose
and right here and I'm gonna be using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills located and
I like to put snow which is the widest
one on my nose and I put a little tap
and then I just follow that no no it's
like some white dots but I also take a
little bit of Sun rain which is like a
gold or color you know just place it oh
my nose just to give it that extra glow
and then I'm just gonna do my final
touches I think my ears I'll be back in
a minute just show you guys the final
look all right so now I'm just going to
be spraying my face and then um done I'm
