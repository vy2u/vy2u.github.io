hello so today I'm gonna be basically
showing you guys how I fix my friends
who when the beginning starts to bald
and I'm doing this just to show you
because this happens with all friend
tools you know the hair that you plug
the baby air and start to fall off and
then all you have now is just like extra
mates so for those girls who do by my
news wigs sometimes I'll cut off that
extra base for you guys and sometimes
depending on my schedule I don't really
have time to cut off the extra base for
you guys so today I decided I'm gonna
show you guys not only if you buy laces
from me but from forever it when it
happens to you I made something to show
you guys what you do to fix that like
you can get a lot of wear out of these
laces
especially when the front part is only
balding but when you start getting ball
spots in the middle and stuff like that
that's what you gotta let that thing go
but for right now if your friends who
looks like this you can fix it no need
to throw it away no needs to get a new
front so you can 100% fix it so
basically it's super super easy right
now you can probably see this tan cap
but don't worry I'm gonna have that glue
down that's and that's on a whole nother
video that I'm gonna be making for you
guys which is gonna be my step by step
weight on how I install and glue down my
wigs so please don't ask me in the
comments cuz the video is coming so
first thing I'm gonna do right now like
right now I already have the cap blew
down so there's no point in me telling
I'm not gonna make I'm just gonna take
my scissors and I'm going to start to
cut all this extra least
now if you don't really know how to work
with laces and lace wigs lace frontals
then I wouldn't really recommend you
doing this on your own but since I do
this on a regular you know you just cut
off that extra lace where there's like
no hair only like over here I can
actually work with this by the way when
it's followed like this I can still
apply it and make it look good because I
do my baby here and all that but for
those who don't and now I got some
pieces so guys I've been wearing this
here for a bottom look now and basically
I just cut off all the extra pieces so
now you can see my tan check this is a
reinstall so now you're not cut off all
the little excess pieces of hair I'll be
right back in just a second
all right y'all so I have now cut off
the lace and as you can see it's looking
like what's up and I just want head and
I'm glued it down off the camera and as
you can see this side still looks light
I think I used a little too much cool on
this side but have no fear it is going
to dry clear and obviously this side is
definitely more like balding then this
side is but I'm gonna end up pulling on
my baby hair it's doing some plucking
and I'm gonna show you guys how I kind
of cover up this little balding spot
right here
right now so you can take your makeup
brush if you'd like I kind of don't want
to mess it because the gloves go dry
but I know this part regardless it's
gonna stay light like this but this part
right here is going to dry clear once
it's finished drying so probably by the
end of this video you'll come see a
whole difference in it so I'm just gonna
take some of my powder that I use on my
face and I'm just gonna dab it in there
and I'm gonna do it on this part is well
that seems to be lighter because that's
definitely wet I don't want to change
the grill color you know I'm also gonna
make a different foundation which is a
bit crazy but give me a second so now um
this part is already Christian I think
my side my middle part is a little off I
lined it up for how about I here was
already parted and now I'm going to just
take some tweezers take my tweezers and
just pluck through right here because it
looks so like not natural so here I'm
grabbing some baby hairs from right here
this is helping my baby earth but this
part needs to be plucked
these little baby hairs take your
tweezers
I know sometimes it'll probably feel
like nothing's plucking but I promise
you
hairs coming off and let me tell you
guys how you know because when you do
this here's the hair that ends up coming
out so now that I fixed this sides and I
like you I'm just going to take my
little column make sure that when you
guys separate your baby hairs that you
guys also put the baby hairs own that's
how you end up having super fake and
crazy baby ears and with my little tulip
I'm just gonna do that is this definite
like I broke thing put a cycle razor I'm
gonna take it y'all know the routine
like if you're watching me y'all know
how to do baby here it's like I'm not
even going to tell with this because I
always do my baby hairs for you guys
okay so now now I'm just going to be
taking my toothbrush we taking Michael
realist not and I'm just gonna take a
tad bit in ages
so no baby here and a little bit of
heroes that's right here it well taking
like a couple brushes to get the baby
years to your personal likings it takes
me like a couple swoops nice I'm not
gonna lie to y'all I love my baby years
and I hate but some people comment on my
stuff and be like you were gonna rock
nothing any big ears
and it's like girl these are my baby
ears mine not yours like do your baby
here's how you want your baby hairs done
and I'm gonna do mine I like mine done
y'all see me come sit on people stop
something awesome your baby hairs could
have been less or I need to hold this I
got a whole decided you so you
don't worry go see now I'm gonna show
you guys what is
feel free looks like this disabilities
and a wife like this think I'll be
enough but the way I'm trying to do my
business is I'm trying to swoop it but
have it going in the flow of the hair
instead of a B just being the hairline
and then baby here all on my forehead
how I used to do it back in my old
videos this is the new Charlene show me
in 2.0 it's reading 2.0 2.0 video
so when you're gonna do these two
schools for this suddenly here
eventually starts to fall out okay seems
like this plants been drying off more
but here I'm gonna show you guys
something you see how it got these balls
fall right over here
I'm gonna take my baby hairs
the camera yo I'm finishing my hair
first yeah yeah yeah no we're recording
right now come say yo damn you're fine
in there bitch oh yeah oh if she's
pregnant she don't even look fat I'm big
at the shirt but she's pregnant she's
airline it's all four words she can't
hear you I'm watching her video come get
on the camera say hi no anyways
hello it's Russia from my home in now oh
I got my hair now I'm going to be just
taking this part and I'm gonna swoop it
in right here so it kind of covers the
little balls of bone but they now looks
like I have major swings which is see
that's why I need to take off this part
this and now I kind of fixed the ball
spot right in now we're gonna do some
more baby here so I'm gonna take these
over here
take this all right doing that as you
can see um with the foundation
everything that glue is starting to dry
it worn so the colors are changing I am
gonna end up scooping distance it right
here so I'm just going to go ahead and
plug over this part some because when
you swoop hair in two parts it needs to
be plucked or it's gonna be like them
the hair you plug like your baby here
gonna be swollen it's gonna look super
super thick so I'm gonna go ahead and
get my thingy and now I'm just going to
take this little piece of hair and going
to swoop it with this wig I didn't
really do sideburns with it so this is
really what it's looking like
alright so now this is so pretty this is
marina it's too late but this is what it
looks like
and I'm just running my fingers through
it grabbing any pieces of hair that I
plugged out and you know a little hairs
that are shedding because I mean they
are does says no need to lie all hair
sheds whoa no effect
straight back something here but I need
to be gentle because I didn't soldier
sweep down I'm so glad they're like okay
I need Thomas head yeah Papa tags up in
here mission over so no I'm just running
my fingers through here and brushing it
into position because I'm gonna try to
wet it and you know make it so it is ooh
baby this is what I like to use on my
curly hair it is the Garnier Fructis
style car Renu reacting milk spray
hydrates and defiance curls for
naturally curly hair with coconut oil
yeah also you know how I am with my
natural curly hair just raise it and I
also you need some money to not forget
about the cleanser in the middle of
these big old pumps you gotta open your
hair and get in there don't be afraid to
kick I know it still looks big right
just wait this hair is so pretty like
I'm gonna like curly hair it's like the
prettiest hair me it's super pretty but
straight hair is nice hair
but curly hair the way don't worry good
and it's just cancel free the water I
mean I need a little money but courier
to me is like I'll be putting the curly
thing in in the clothes and then spring
it and I also like to get my ends I hate
beans right over here but this curly
hair don't really get dry like when you
stuff in it like absorbs it but it
doesn't make it dry all right so now
that I've got the air all revved up and
it's all nice and pretty it's pretty
and I also by the way I washed this hair
in conditioning last night and let air
dry it the next day but I conditioned it
with the bios soup shampoo and I use the
conditioner which is called um it's like
soup it was calling this silky inferno
something like that but once you see it
stopping by still don't really have
multiple conditioners so you probably
it's only one but I use the Bison it's
in a great bottle what about tea cap so
yes these is what the chrome on this
side it's like a Mike I really wish I
had my own cuz I like to keep my cool
and like press the back so it stays kind
of like slicked back some this side like
honestly I personally feel like this
hair don't do nothing but give me
straight Dominican auntie's who don't
got curly hair like I'm looking like
darnell frog legs Miami like I wish
somebody would say this not my real hair
like weird
no Christine alright so now I just
sprayed some of my going here curl
rejuvenator and I think I can see though
at the natural state of the hair like I
didn't have a brand like my fingers ran
through you can actually see it I don't
really need nothing and just hair but
water to it I'm going out so I just want
to keep it light like I don't want the
curls to get too big so this routine
keeps the curls down a bit
