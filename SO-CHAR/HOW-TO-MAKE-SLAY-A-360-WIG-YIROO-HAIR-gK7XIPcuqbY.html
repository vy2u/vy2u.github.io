I'm just gonna show you guys basically
how I bleach and creates my 360 wig what
I like to do first I like to go ahead
and go with the free spray buy got to be
glue and I'm just gonna be covering the
front of the hair with that just in case
bleach seeps through or bleach gets on
it I don't want the hair to be brown or
blonde patchy mark so that's why I put
that little freeze tag free it's kind of
like a shield to me
so I didn't wash the hair out with some
shimmer lights and conditioned it so
right now I'm just using this cap this
is dome cap I use either the women's cap
or I use the men cap but I don't like
the net one I usually like them to be
close and solid so now you're gonna just
see me putting the 360 front tool on to
the net and I'm gonna be positioning it
your hairline should be at least two
inches above I mean wait
- yeah two inches above the dome cap and
yeah
I'm just sewing now I'm just sewing the
front so down to the dome cap and now
I'm taking my scissors and I'm just
cutting off that extra cap space that we
don't need and won't be using at all and
now I'm going to be taking my scissors
and I'm just going to be cutting the
extra lace that's on there and I'm gonna
be going in and starting to sew on my
tracks to the hair I'm not gonna go too
much into details on this how to sew de
tracks you'll see a good view of how I
do it but I'm just gonna keep doing that
and keep going across and as I get
higher it's gonna be kind of going into
like a upside down and position is what
I'll be doing
now I'm part of my hair so I can begin
flattening y'all know I love me some
cheese
so confusion so I'm gonna be running my
fingers through and putting that in the
hair and then I'm gonna be piece by
piece flat ironing my hair with my flat
iron brush and if you guys are
interested in this brush I'm not sure
what the name is but I found mine on
Amazon so I'm pretty sure you type in
Amazon Flatiron brush you might just
find it it was only about $11 so yeah
y'all I am looking raggedy in the corner
with my Haitian flag I hadn't cut myself
like oh alright y'all
hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm wearing hair from euro hair is
a online base website it's not an
express your own on Facebook and I'm
wearing at 360 frontal in the linked 20
and I'm wearing only two bundles of 20
and 26 in a previous video I showed you
guys how I made the week so now I have
it on my head
I haven't even fixed my part but I'm
basically gonna show you guys how I
customize it and how I'm about to slay
this weighing in honestly I would feel
like it's time that I switched over to a
side part because I haven't been wearing
side part in like I swear to you I'm the
middle part feeling like I love my
middle parts
I throw it to the side for a little bit
and see how it looks if I'm like here
I'll just put it in the middle all right
so I'm gonna just be flipping it to this
side since I'm gonna be wearing it to
the side I'm just gonna flick to the
side and fix my part so I can decide on
the position that my bait here is we'll
go up here I'm gonna going to take my
hot iron it just press right here oh so
I get started to lady that would be yo
month I don't need to excuse my nose in
this video I know I know I know
all right it's just I'm going to hurt
Cameron oh my god military paper I don't
have to like bear with me because I'm
going through a hurricane right now and
most of the no shops are closed and I
broke my nose during the frickin
hurricane so right now they look like
this I'm going to get them fixed today
so please don't do me nobody better cool
me down
oh my video talked about you need to get
chilled out cuz I will fry your ass
excuse me anyways though so let's see oh
oh with the baby here oh my fingers look
so dusty
I'm gonna formally do too much baby here
it's because I'm going for it that's
natural as I can't be with a be late
this is I wanna like cuz I'm gonna get
on Instagram and talk about how it got
me a fresh poem and I want to do
anything salty I want to make this as
much as I can and I shall know I love to
use my gorilla slopped allow you all
connects me what I leave here with and I
just used my that's mine
sometimes I use edge control anger with
a smile I'm actually in the middle of
testing home and edge control because I
want it I want to like create my own
edge control line so right now I'm
mainly testing it out on like your
natural hair don't think that I'm not
really doing it on the front nothing yet
but I have been on the front tooth and I
see how it works for the photos it works
good for the freshness goal for now I'm
trying it on natural hair but I don't
know my hair and whatnot yeah we see I
wish I will come up with her and
actually my Lisa Salters back right here
I'm gonna split blue down so here's a
little tip like when this happens just
pull out a piece from the front like
from the word lace starts there and just
pull it forward and probably gonna do
like a smooth forward you know just cool
cause it doesn't look like it's that
much hair there
those bulbs but it's not solid it's just
the lace is way back there so look
and in your hair gonna cover any missile
you just push down to other hairs that
comes with it that's what it'll look
like
yes hmm
so yeah that's what this size look like
and I'm probably gonna press it up some
more
you do look a little thin here but I'm
making my 360s
a little too small I made a 360 frontal
before but this time right here I always
put this wanna curl to my head and I
always pull it back so basically I can
just have the air is going back in the
next direction so I can see more where
I'll put us to be done so that's kinda
why I'm always taking that one swimmer
in plucking it like that just in case
y'all was wondering why doing it right
here
I loved for my slopes to be right here I
just I've always wanted like you know
those girls that had those really pretty
hair lines in my hairline come right
here and right here so they'd be here
school I love that hair line and I'll
got it so I create it all the time and
with right here I'm just probably gonna
leave a piece all right we'll leave that
piece goes it all show I'm gonna just do
one little small baby here right here
just just to do it
just a small piece I don't feel like I
need to be sweet here right there with
ya I know and I feel understand it's 360
frontals I think that the quality of 360
frontals are so so so much different
than the quality on like a break-in
reference where I think the quality or
360s are just amazing like my first 360
friends who I had from Austria here is
my first 360 frontal anus the last map
ever had was from Austria and the
quality of that frontal was amazing it
was beautiful it was so pretty
I mean I didn't even take that hair I
can't figure out if I can have your PIN
for like a good month I came to the
front of our site it just Baldy you know
I want to keep it longer but I can tell
from how this front is starting to look
it's the same make it seem like it's
good quality period
I like to have my little sniper thing so
imma just take this thing it must have
been like just like that
right here and I didn't have to put too
much here but I'm not going on you I'm
not fill in the sidebar it's only like I
don't like sad parts on G no more I used
to yeah y'all I'm putting it to the
middle I'm putting it in the middle like
I can't I don't over here that I don't
pressed to the side like this but I have
to put it in the middle like this I
don't like so for this exactly don't
myself but it's pretty for everybody
else I just
oh and I've already pressed this here
and showed you guys how I pressed it
something definitely won't be pressing
it again I'm just taking my wand no and
then pressing it down so we can evilly
it's led me press down to the middle and
basically I just keep doing such a mess
with you I won't do it first thing I try
Joey you've seen I tried I try that try
that try and also when I'm using my wand
to press it down I kind of pull it back
son
so it can fall back doesn't like right
from my hair antis little
could be parked in the middle maybe put
it in the Schmidt and also guides here
let me make this clear as well like I
definitely am NOT professional at this I
honestly do this why should people but I
do my hair and I I make my mistakes like
I'm not perfect like as you can see from
right here this part is really over
bleached so I'm going to show you guys
how to face your over bleach not grab
you some mascara I'm actually looking
for my brother so but here's some
mascara and just do this with you I've
been getting a whole lot subscribers me
I get a lot of comments and I know I'm
nice following is like still really
small but I'll be missing a lot comments
so I don't want no one to ever feel like
I completely ignore them answer their
question because y'all be coming through
with the questions and I get in I like
and I favorite as many as I can like I
already honestly do like sometimes a
comment like slipped through and I don't
even see it but a lot of time if I'm on
the computer I have my Google set up so
like while I'm on the computer on my
Treacher
comment and I also need instantly quick
there and respond or answer your
question if I list it I can probably go
through my notifications but there's
like a lot of comments I'll come across
and I don't ever even remember seeing
them so even if you call me a couple
months from now your comment still might
get like like but I'm never nice
something about the negative comments
got me like what you're going you need
to go on it and don't eat this moment my
god always tell me here's my negative
comments but almost sweet ones I got me
missing y'all and you know I'm saying
this nothing personal just really be a
lot of y'all so you know what I'm about
to do right now I'm just taking my wax
stick I'm going to be brushing my hair
back some cuz ya'll know I like to have
bad sort of a little push back and then
this little stick shed doesn't like my
first type of footing really using it
but I'm not too much I work in a salon
if y'all didn't know about to start
working in a salon like tomorrow
okay so stick thing you know just up to
my game you up in a season boy like my
titties
so this stick is a definite this is Cara
it's like air of care and you can get it
from between $12 to $20 depending on how
stricken you know it's best if you abuse
my stories Amazon it's 12 so in that
prime then they start I'm sure ain't no
joke so already this is the finishing of
my hair this is what I've come up with
you know I'm saying this is super pretty
I'm gonna mm-hmm I'm gonna try to keep
this hair I have like a whole bunch
people here hold it
I have like a ton that's what a ton a
ton a ton of hair all right not that
much but a whole bunch of hair videos
coming up for you guys so I just want
y'all to be prepared this way where
these hair is all about Campbell a
stupid hair like you can clearly see is
sitting here like at least rock it for
that long but it's Mitch I'm normally if
you shouldn't fight him out but I know
this hair for sure this is my first time
wearing it and Aiko washed it it's big
hole washed and it's been that's it it's
been washed it's been coached in this is
the first day of me wearing it and as
you can see look at that Lee yo I'm
about to get my snapchat listen my
snapchat is Charlene forever and
listening I'm another thing I talk so
much another thing like I'm moving out
me feeling like I'm Express stops new me
he's ready plastic fucking lashes I got
home right now I have a woman right now
like I literally ran out of that shit so
I said you know what I'm gonna take my
chi silk infusion and I'm just gonna try
to spray my whole top of my head in the
side of my head and here is what this is
don't embarrass me don't embarrass me up
today all right so this is all the hair
three bundles two bundles and if you're
60 pencil this is what it looks like you
know I'm like 5'4 so it comes down to
like my age you only ready know what 26
looking likely
anyways oh yeah
anyways we don't smoke no steam um I
also wanted to add in another thing i am
i posted a previous video stating that
i'll express the vendor's send everybody
in the same year and stop asking me
whether this year since me or not it
doesn't matter and I did get some
comments back on it and I just want to
say that I didn't mean its offense like
I know in the video I came up a super
harsh but I was I get this question
thanks so much so as you guys know I'm a
youtuber not to care for you so yes all
this hair is since me if I could
purchase some hair I'll let you know
whether I purchased it or I did well I'm
not commissioner my dating cuz it don't
matter so if I purchased it I'll say I
purchase it but if you don't see me
pressure to say I purchased this here
then it will sense me so hey and right
now s4l Express sending companies better
hair my subscriber count is only at 10 I
have 12 K down like I'm not passable
like they probably sit in Malibu some
top-of-the-line shit but as for hair
companies like I am Express I get the
same hair that they would probably send
you because a lot of times they sent me
some shit hair and I did not review that
hair sometimes their smokes I don't
review that hair so if I'm reviewing it
the hair came to me and it was good like
miss hair all those companies its own
one here there's any I'm not Malibu so
I'm not the makeups on like those people
they probably get the best of the best
or whatnot
if that's how y'all feel but I feel like
everybody probably gets the same hair if
you feel like I like a youtubers get
better hair then when you order your
hair tell them because you'll be doing
super tell me we're in Silverlight
telling I'm youtuber I will bless your
company if you give me something here
like if that's how y'all fizzle then
make a difference when y'all order here
anyway so another thing I want to
discuss is the last parent that I had
was a book cut Bob I will have a picture
inserted right here so you guys can see
what the big wig looks like just in case
you forgot
everybody's been
asking me about this wig and is it for
sale in yes it's for sale
I'm gonna be selling at four hundred and
fifty dollars I'm selling a way cheaper
than the other ones I've sold because it
is a short cut hair but I mean it's
short but I cut it short was already
short but I could have shorter and plus
I saw that when you made that wig so
it's going for a good price 150 is a
price for my blood come please and I
will also end it as use so it's like one
day P I will also be having three more
custom a bit of cufflinks in stock so
one night in stock
rafer ready for a pre-order so I have
three that will be available and each
are going for 250 but the one that I'm
selling right now it's going for 150 so
be mindful when you do try to purchase
it that the 150 is they used one and the
brand new that I have there are three
will be 250
so anyways but that being said this is
your o'hare and I hope you guys enjoy
this looks I love showing y'all Heisley

moustache my hedges don't get me started
don't get me started
