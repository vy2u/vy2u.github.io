she's nothing like you
she did her and she's nothing like you
she met a violent Ellison she loved me
better and better she loved me better
and she made me happy she made me laugh
she brought me when you let me down
could you hold a time look on with Allah
cuz you hold a title you know
could you hold
better oh hey guys welcome back to my
channel
alright so today I've gotten this
everyone's always actually behind on can
you draw the toriel on how you remove
and reinstall your lace like everyone's
always asking me this so I'm gonna show
you guys how I remove my lace I don't
have our movie clean off the glue and
also how I reinstall the legs so the
first thing that I'm gonna be doing is
taking my spray bottle okay
so generally me because I'm a youtuber
and I make a lot of hair tutorial videos
I don't usually keep my laces in as long
as usual so I usually change my hair
every week or every 7 days but because
I've had so much lost in my edges from
constantly taking my hair out every
putting it back in I decided that I used
less coats of blue and I basically allow
my hair to sit for maybe like eight days
or more
and what that being done I also just I
don't start to take off my legs until
it's completely started listening so I'm
gonna zoom in for you guys okay so now
that I'm doing that for you guys I'm
basically going to show you guys what
the top looks like as you can see right
here it's starting to live and basically
all the sides are starting to live and
what I'm gonna do is take my sock
this is a clean sock I would use a dirty
sock he's me but this is a clean black
sock and I'm going to spray the sock
with some alcohol and this is basically
gonna help lift up the hair you can use
a spray bottle or you can put the
alcohol directly on your head I used to
spray the hair with I see like spray it
directly with the spray bottle but
now I don't want to get alcohol
everywhere it and have it dropping down
my face it really does end up burning
the eye so I'm just gonna do it like
this in as you can see the hair is
already like starting to look more than
what it's already lifted up back I also
like to take this like spray and just
press it in you don't want to do too
much rubbing because if you do too much
rubbing it will definitely just like
pull the hairs off of the lease as you
can see it's starting to lift up um
right here is definitely starting to
lift up and the top part is to it and
you can rub it on the flipside so that's
also helping like clean the glue off of
the leaf when you flip it but don't have
it laid down and wrote that because then
you're gonna be rubbing off the hair
okay so boom this side just came off
really good starting to lift up I'm just
gonna go ahead and saturate it some more
because if you ever feel like a pain
when you're doing this that means you're
probably pulling some of your hair so
you just want to take your time and be
really really gentle I'm gonna basically
go ahead and continue on this routine
all right so Oh the cap is still like
the booth Isles my head and I'm gonna go
ahead and just um I'm sprayed now I know
I look old as hell but it's my wave cap
y'all I'm just gonna go ahead and spread
his directly to the head because I don't
really care about this getting wet I'm
gonna actually put on a new one so this
definitely is also still tie and glued
onto my head so I gotta wait for that to
loosen up as well in the meantime I'm
gonna show you guys hot clean off the
mace and let me take the hair I've had
in the ponytail so what I like to do is
very very simple as you can see the rim
it's like a gluey line it's not too
crazy it's just right I'm gonna take I'm
gonna spray eat the sauce remember what
I told you guys I'm not trying to get my
whole wig way so I just like to spray
this stock and just like do this and
once I do this you guys will see the
difference I'm not I got to put it down
into it
all right so now you guys basically can
see the difference in this part in this
part so I got you taking a shot of a
liquor that was terrible I don't know if
didn't you all right so I'm just gonna
continue to clean off this whole thing
in the pattern that I told you guys so
this is what it looks like now all that
basically did was basically it's done
now all that basically there was do this
and the glues rolled off as you can see
super easy on the glue that I did use
was all funky
all right so boom the whole lace is
cleaned and this is what it looks like I
still have baby hairs but nothing is
like all bald or nothing like that in
the front I'm definitely gonna be able
to just reuse it again as I did all
right so now on to the second part and
that's basically going to be removing
the cap
if there's any pool mean I just stopped
like right there everything will then
come off but once I got to this little
corner it was a whole cooling so I'm
just gonna just take this and just rub
it out as you guys can see my baby hair
is like I'm not bald in the baby air
there yeah I still got me some baby hair
as you feel me but I definitely was bald
like that's why I took a like month
break off of um I that's around the time
when I took up almost two month break
off of um put the cameras off of youtube
around that time I was basically just
getting a break and breathing in letting
my hair grow back and take a break from
all the weave and all the chemicals he
minor is still like growing back there
like thinking baby ears they're like
barely there but they're if you guys
would have seen them before they were
like all gone so yeah
all right
this part is still damn glued but as you
can see I probably lost some inches
right here but I still got some in the
front
still got some on this side people a lot
of people not just me but a lot of
people I think that they're like bald
with the edges part is because when you
wear laces a lot you kind of get a 10
halo over your forehead and then I have
it it's like right here like this part
it's like way lighter than my actual
skin and that's because I was really
where laces a lot so that part doesn't
really get any Sun so now before I um
put my lid on I just like to give my
scalp a few minutes to moisturize and I
put some to make it back oil on my
hairline and um I'm just gonna go ahead
and just let that sit for a little bit
and just get some air and moisturize
itself some if you guys are wondering
about my lashes I know you're probably
thinking like shego minks but these are
minks but these are mixed strips I just
love them so much Kathy Kathy I just
love them so much they're so natural
these are my Newton these are like these
are from my new these are my new lashes
like I have my old lashes and I have
like some new lashes I got two new lash
styles and these ones are in the style
pixie I love them they supposed to give
off like a more natural mink look I was
gonna call them wicks
whispies cuz they are like really wispy
but I might pixie better all right so
now I'm gonna just let it sit for a few
minutes all right so now I'm gonna go
ahead and just put my cap over my here
oh I always do this talking method like
I've actually been doing it for since I
started doing Lisa's so I'm going to
take it and the stocking cap is too much
for my tone someone asked me why don't I
just use the brown ones I feel like the
brown ones are too dark and it doesn't
really give you that scalp effect so I
like to use this one that I have I'm
just gonna take my makeup brush yeah
I'm mixing a tool of these face powders
cuz once to lighten one's just right I'm
into dark and thereby ruby kiss and ones
in chestnut another one is a caramel so
I like to take those two inches pass
them up on my hairline
alright so now I'm going to be taking my
vase cool just this ghost Bongo
everybody must note right now nothing
too major but the little spot and I'm
just going to take it and put it number
right here and then I will turn my ear
and then I'm just going to press my
finger and smooth it out I'm going to do
the same as you guys can see my hairline
is like way back here and now I'm going
to take my freeze tag space and just
spray the hair and you guys can probably
still see where my actual hairline is so
for those who don't know I just put the
least food like right here in my hair
that is behind that so now I'm gonna let
this dry for a few minutes and then I'll
be back when it's dry and ready to go
alright guys I'm so so sorry but I
forgot to hit record and I already cut
the lease off so I'm sorry
so now this is what it's looking like
width on the ends like the cut off
is what it's looking like and now I'm
just gonna go ahead and try on my wig
there have some difficulties with this
side like caps that are rolling back I
guess it wasn't that sort of free tax
rate didn't really drawing it but I just
put dogs in glue and said it I'm right
so as you can see my middle part is
still here I think I'm gonna end up
switching it suicide though but yeah so
here everything is starting to line up
exactly the same
all right appreciate I'm gonna start
this bit because I need to cut this flap
some more like right in this area so let
me just go ahead and uh oh by the way
I'm cutting it would have raised there
which is on I've never done it before
but it is pretty hard all right whatever
I'm gonna put this down so this is what
it looks like
yes ma'am mmm you ma'am oh um by the way
I know you're never gonna ask I do not
take my lace I used to tinted when I was
first doing started doing laces and
stuff like that but I don't tinted I
just don't lay down lay down I just put
on my foundation tone on it and I'm sort
of matching foundation tone of my cap as
well you know I'm basically gonna just
line the parts where glue is gonna go
and we're like cuts in you know like
where is that I just do this so that
when I apply the lace everything is like
all ready to rock and nothing's like I
just it's just like lining it just like
when you teach your kids how to do what
people have kids just a lot of yeah I
probably don't want kids but when you
teach your kids they BC they got a trace
to it like I just like to trace money so
the glue goes on at a nice ratio not
even a ratio but at a nice form like I
don't just put it straight across
because the hairline as you can see is
cut in and out and Songhai straight
across so now I'm gonna take my ghost
bond and I'm just going to align the
hairline with this
and you might see those stroke of my
finger I like to basically pull it that
way so that basically just leaves the
cap down flatter and I'll have it
looking word I'm not gonna put more than
two coats on because I don't plan on
leaving it in for that move so now
you're in position dang it yeah you
gotta just pull it forward and
start bringing down
and I'm gonna take my alcohol and you're
basically gonna clean off any of these
black dots you know stutters knees
finished the glue hasn't fully dried yet
but that's fine
all right guys as you can see I got my
here in a start part but I'm thinking
about switching it to I mean having in
the middle part I just ruin your
surprises I'm thinking about switching
it smooth at the side so that's what I'm
gonna do it I'm sad to you middle school
and even in this matter I just take this
home and
pick II guess I'm gonna make this side
the side that is coming on so I'm gonna
take this code and I'm just gonna start
putting it suicide even know I took my
middle parts do I'm gonna to the side
don't get me wrong the next I press are
you really good on me too all right I'm
gonna do it to this the middle I went to
the side because you guys asked me all
this time to do more side part so what
that man said I'm taking my route plan
and I'm just going to uh I'm just gonna
come in like look at me either I wants
to get rid of my middle part I miss
where to this that is
I need this pup to cover the trash
you
all right Joe so basically I just did
this up before baby hairs I guess I
didn't have to cut it over in here it's
because of my previous install I still
had the leftover baby hair so I did some
on this time just something light and
then I did some on this side so I'm
still not really used to the whole side
