back to my channel so in the previous
video I showed you guys how I basically
touch up my frontal so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to put it into a part 1 and
part 2 I did tell part 1 that I was
gonna record this makeup look but I
pretty much feel like my channel is kind
of already invested into hair invested
into hair and I mean I really think you
guys care for my makeup but if you guys
do want me to do more makeup tutorials
I'll basically do it by how much people
comment down below and tell me they want
more makeup tutorial if you do want more
makeup tutorials so comment down below
if you guys know it's makeup stores
anyways hi guys welcome back to my
channel
so I have changed my channel name to
siya so sharp it used to be you love
sharp but now it's so sharp so alright
okay but I do like the new name so right
now I've already done I've already glued
my frontal down in the previous video so
be sure to check that out link will be
down in the description box so I've
already laid it back down glue this back
down with Robles glue and as well as Jo
down my baby ears so I put this little
rap thing on cuz I was also mentioning
how I tied my hair down at night with
this little wrap thing so more details
in part one so now I'm just gonna go
ahead and this side is like slid back so
it looks way more like plugged in stuff
versus this side which is alright the
first thing that I'm going to be taking
doing is basically oh I'm so dumb
by the way from the title already read
this is basically like my silk press
updated routine on how to press my hair
and laying my hair down so um this is my
own in one baby like she like this right
here when it comes to doing my makeup
and everything like that she is my best
friend so I'm let me take a little bit
and I'm just gonna be running into the
top of my head and I'm gonna be running
it through my hair quick details on this
hair I am wearing hair from madula hair
company and I'm wearing a 20 inch
frontal 22 24 and 26 inch in the bundles
and this hair was Brazilian
this was Brazilian body wave but I
flattened it and I didn't use all my
bundles I had like I want to say like
about this much left over in the 26 no
22 in the 22 so now this is what it's
looking like you know I'm saying it's
alright like you don't really have to do
much to this hair like the one time I
still pressed it is stayed pretty nice
but I'm just gonna go ahead and show you
guys how I maintain the flow
damnit I was supposed to change my shirt
okay right so you're gonna be taking my
hot coals and I don't have to want that
you put in a stove I actually have the
ones that you plug into the wall don't
you mean the ones that be in the stove
though she's just too hot so I mean like
I don't start mine
so first thing I'm gonna do is be taking
my hot comb and I'm just slowly gonna be
running off the top of the hair this is
just basically going to be laying down
the hair and basically it's gonna be
pressing it'll be here allow me to give
you a more natural look so if you guys
do order like if he's every order and
moves away from me that is straight hair
make sure you guys go ahead of all this
routine because when I do shake the wig
I only shift it washed enjoy so you do
have the right key for me I actually put
this heat side on my face so my face has
like you see how it's kind of up close
out to pull my spring my lace down our
planet but I was like four black dots
well now it's probably scared away so
they're not like zero
like brownish they're starting to do but
angle gosh it's hot Kunz it's my baby
like I don't really use it I mean I
don't ever do anybody's hair or my hair
without it like the best friend and you
know you I know I can't be the only one
I'd be like oh yeah like you just speak
like you only want to know about this
the only one that knows out that if you
do your hair this way like that and if
somebody else I probably up the whole
stage routine from you it's kind of like
I met that I'm going to be using this
flower and someone already asked me what
kind of flowers in my previous video but
this is just a regular degler flower and
I bought this Holly Marshalls and it was
about $24.99 and it's called the cortex
international Flatiron and it's like
inch and a half or whatever it is but
it's the new flower that got my eye on
it's about 70 dollars I've been saying I
was gonna get it but I haven't going to
get it but yeah that is I just know the
donor so I'm gonna be just taking my
mirror in middle parts and you know as
you guys not seen I had that little comb
with me but I do carry it at the shop so
you don't really need it from flawless
install especially if your hair's
already fun like mine but if you were to
have like a fresh new install I would
recommend
use using that so I'm just going to be
pressing it out I'm not going to go in
small sections because I can see this
week this is by far one of the best
straight heads I've ever had from
knocked over here or from anywhere not
just doing here but this is this oneís
main issue is how good it is that it
definitely does and I know I always
tell you guys is that like all your
put this no it's bad bad but you
know like if you're in the bathroom and
you're finding your hair when you finish
it's gonna be like here good money but
it is when like you can run your hands
through it like two strings over here
the hair comes in also the hair comes in
like a natural brown hair so
for those girls there's some girls you
know that don't wear natural grounds
they like there's gonna be jet black
like I do jet black doesn't like the
hair comes natural look I'm not going
away to die just like usually thanks the
girls at the shop they won't apply to
here without his beard just like their
first flat iron did I put like the body
weights when it is in a very the street
this should be like basically how to sew
press you're here ten minutes after
after that I'm going to go ahead it
takes a happens
to just beat but she hears back some
just so want me to turn it okay we get
hot as hell but it I'll get cold fast me
I'm gonna be just taking this I like it
to live over here I don't know I just
feel like it looks like it's coming
roots in that nest I'm gonna go back
with a chi a little more Chi in a little
bit she like it's expensive but you can
get it for cheap surprises at Marshall's
but um that's why I queued like most of
my hair products
oh that's on my corner like my chi in my
bio silk I get them all and marshes
because they sell them for a discounted
price so we all spend yacht tour know
you started all these things you give
like 16 and she's commercial alright so
this is the final look
oho so that is the end of this tutorial
