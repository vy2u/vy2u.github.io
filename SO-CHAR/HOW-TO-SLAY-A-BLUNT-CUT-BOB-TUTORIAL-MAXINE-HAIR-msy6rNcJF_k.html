Marcel I'm feeling a bit let myself I'm
feeling myself but your mother lamar
below myself I'm still on my cell
I'm feeling a bit let myself I'm feeling
myself some hood cause looking back at
it and a good excuse me my stocking cap
I did not know I was in the camera like
that so I'm gonna be cutting and I'm
also gonna be going over it with my
clippers just to make sure I have a
sleek straight line I know it looks a
little off right now but that's just
because the hair hasn't been pressed out
and flattened but keep watching and
you'll see it comes out perfect I'm not
gonna lie to you guys at this point I
cut it super short but don't worry about
it I went back over and I went with my
razors and I fixed it
and while of the outcome is gonna be
this I pressed it out in this is what it
looks like
alright hi guys welcome back to my
channel so now that I showed you guys I
didn't show you guys how to make a wish
but I showed you guys how I cut it into
a book cut like this let me give you
guys some details on this hair kisses
hair from Maxine hair on Aliexpress and
I'm wearing two bundles of Brazilian
straight I'm wearing up to 14 inches in
my frontal was a 14 inch and not cut it
solo right now my hair is looking like a
tape line so I'm going to be going in
with my tweezers and I'm gonna do some
plucking and pull out my baby head
now we'll make this wait look like
something every time you do it it's
taking my walk it looks literally bucket
Kaitlyn right now but have no fear
you girls let's leave this week home I'm
just gonna be taking like pulling on
those sections and you know looking it
some more you know often when we turn in
we're taking my curling iron and like
lean the ears back so I guess see don't
know why but I feel like I barely plug
this hole but I really sat down and put
the issue here before I washed it and
everything
as you can see is get your room
thinner oh by the way this way lighting
right here the word looks super light on
my face just because I guess that was
residue boom some of my glue and the
foundation made at that color
I'm gonna start filling in the part in
picking out my baby hairs but first I'm
gonna pluck out this some more you want
also gonna be easy up to the hang out
the hair that I pulled out just to give
it a thinner didn't look
look
you know what we're just gonna do like
no more baby here right here
that's what this sighs look I'm gonna
stop this guy
all right you guys so I'm almost done I
just need to you press out my little
person anytime I really just needed to
press out my middle part this was
looking like y'all I don't know why but
this is just me but I always end up
liking one side better the other bit
better than the other and I want to say
that this side is like taking a because
how Fisher I'm not done with the
plucking on this I'm gonna end up
probably plucking so much more here just
to get it to my likings but this frontal
is overall very nice very thick it's a
whole out of here you know I'm saying it
don't really shed so I did kind of want
my BOB to be cut a little bit shorter
than what it actually came out to be but
I think I'm gonna end up flipping it too
the side part so this is what I look at
my bring this back looks like I hope you
