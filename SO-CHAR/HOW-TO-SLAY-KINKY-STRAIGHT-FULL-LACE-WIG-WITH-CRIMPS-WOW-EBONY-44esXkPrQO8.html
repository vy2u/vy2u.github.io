guava knee and I just added some creep
since we don't say I'll put it up the
half-up half-down you no no no no you
know little girl teenies nonsense of
y'all feeling this tutorial in this look
like it's a look is this play like this
so is everything be sure to keep on
watching I'm sorry I'm gonna be taking
my razor I'm just going to be cutting
off the rim it's really hard to show you
guys and do it so I'm just gonna go
ahead and just do it so now I'm cutting
like as close to the hairline as
possible alright
oh and another thing I forgot to mention
to you guys is that the lace comes in
this really natural transparent color so
as you guys can see
oh um
you guys don't really need to call it
lace like Steve look
this is a nice nice color all right so
I'm gonna start by pinning BEC this die
I don't have another pin to do this side
so that's fine I'm just gonna let me
just put this in right here again see
basically coming all the way out to
right here alright so I'm going to be
using the ghost on blue this is my go-to
loo I always tell you guys about this
glue I don't think it'll focus for you
guys but whatever you see how this cap
is sliding back I'm not gonna put any
glue on my hairline but I'm gonna show
you guys the actual trick that you guys
can do from when this does start
happening so I'm gonna take my fingers
and just keep rubbing the glue along
side my ears
please
and I'm just gonna get behind the ear oh
all right sorry I'm gonna get behind the
ears right now I just get that out the
way for later taking this and just
rubbing it in don't forget to rub it in
y'all cuz I've got almost did that just
now and then I'm taking this and I'm
continuing along my hairline you
remember what I said we're getting a
little bit behind the ears for right now
I'm rubbing it in
all right so you see this part I like to
just pull it in late along the glue not
your mouth right in
no more as you see though I'm going to
be taking the league and pulling it
forward
you know if I pull it forward
I just like to drop it directly on the
globe
see and then I'm doing get those for you
we're gonna head into me the sides first
and
working it in and and I'm not gonna end
up cutting some of this sideburn foot
all right now you're going to just be
cutting this off this is too much I'm
gonna cut this off Handan
right
the extra piece of it it's like Ryu
funny way of putting it cut that off and
I'm just going to put it right here take
this smudge it in and I'm also gonna
take the residue that's on here and put
it in right here that's right here needs
some more glue and it was this part
right here needs some more glue
alright so in the midst of letting this
part boy I'm going to go ahead and start
this side
it's all very pretty tacky all right so
I'm gonna just read dust and I'm gonna
read us rate adjust my mental part cuz
that's not going to be wearing the hair
in the middle
yeah this is pretty alright for me all
the hairs in my face
alright so now I'm gonna go ahead and
I'll come in sitting up so I'm just
gonna go ahead and do the baby hair I'm
gonna start off with this section right
here
and I'm just going to be shaving all
right well I've bought in a new gel that
I'm gonna be trying out it's called um
whatnot in extreme gel I'm gonna try it
out and see what it does for the baby
hairs but I'm going to be using that
with the interest refresh if you guys
don't know I do have these available on
my website so make sure you check these
out
they're only like a dollar or two
dollars on my website but you gotta pay
for shipping oh yeah
it's a lot of people actually for these
whoever can't find it at their local pet
store so what available to you guys
so I've done my first whoop and I like
it
I like it I'm gonna just pull this hair
apart out from the here and I'll just
need to some at this very limit
and also right here
what do you guys think about the jail I
think it's like laying them down pretty
good so I'm just gonna let it be and
then you must stay the far which is my
side brains I'm just gonna take
I'm going to take I'm going to take my I
usually use freeze tag spray but I don't
have any at the moment so I'm going to
take my helmet head bye cheese
you know just Portage's spray that so
it'll hold it in place so that's this I
did something like maybe here is on
fleek of course and now I'm gonna put
that side up the way I'm going to go
ahead and turn into the other side which
is it
this side this one is like a little bit
waist smaller compared to this one but
we care
alright guys so this is the final look
of how the baby hairs came out I'm going
to my hot comb just happen it like don't
and I'm just going to be pressing it
down I want to go ahead and just keep
pressing it down I'm gonna go ahead and
um part each space and press it down so
I can have my office letter look alright
so I've already done a couple crimps
look how pretty they look so I'm just
gonna go ahead in show you how they
sweated so what I realized is because
this is my first time ever doing the
trim so like basically we were learning
together so the first thing I did was I
took it and I just slid it through the
first time and when I did that it kind
of made the hair like phlearn weighed
more than what it really is so after I
take that I just go like this and I hold
it for a little bit and then I go back
and I hold it some more and then I keep
on going and I kind of like to scrunch
it up a bit as I go and I'm also taking
like thin pieces and basically this is
the current I'm
coming out so so pretty like I'm like
really really obsessed huh this might be
my go-to hairstyle I really wanted to do
crepes with a different color here but
I'm gonna just keep doing them all the
time and do different side of things but
look at this y'all oh is that for I'm
loving the crisps and you gotta let it
kind of sit for a little bit any when
you crimp down you kind of want to go in
between crimps so like you want to go
with the flow
alright guys so I've had like a whole
lot of technical difficulties first of
all my camera died so I couldn't just
stop doing my hair so I did one side for
you guys and then a little bit of the
other side
nothing I've kind of got the hang of it
I kind of get what I'm doing so I'm
gonna go ahead and do this chunk for you
guys and show you guys basically how to
crimp your hair I've had like just way
too much technical difficulties for it
today alright so I'm just gonna be
taking my hair and pinning it to this
side this is the dumbest pin in the
world it can't even hold it don't hold
nothing all right so I'm just going to
take this and split it in half you take
more on this side all right so what I
like to do is I'll take the crimper and
I'll just quickly run my crimper to it
and that kind of presses it out some so
when I do that after that I just like to
hold it for a little bit and I'm just
going to continue the process holding it
and then see that crouppen and I like to
go back in right there you don't want to
continue to hold some more and then you
just kind of just go in between each
crimp and you kind of just go with the
flow as you can see it looks like a
perfect piece to baking you know I'm
safe so I'll be doing making bacon so
yeah this is basically how it goes I
think that it came out so so so or you
can't see cuz is here I think that
they're coming out so pretty I'm like
honestly obsessed you guys are gonna see
me crapping my hair a whole lot and I'm
probably gonna end up doing more
people's cribs
discomfort is life
damn I feel like I've literally starts
on my hair probably like two and now
it's like one I mean and now it's like
628 like you know got dark outside and
everything
continue to same thing first through
what he likes the slide so make sure
that you're just holding it every move
so it just stays put but y'all sit baby
here is like y'all see it was good so
once again if I didn't already say this
is hair from hair evany and I'm wearing
24 inches ethnicity to 22 or 24 inches
of their kinky straight hair and it's a
full lace wig honestly if the hair is a
real real nice I think this kinky air
gets more and more straight then the
last kinky hair head but I don't know
Oh basically I just did one rule for you
guys and after that I just like to take
they home ahead cheese spray and a
little square they exactly love my face
whatever I'm know it when we come back
after this
I Rachel I'm finally on my last one
oh this was the longest hairstyle I've
ever done I don't know if it's the cribs
I don't know what but I feel like I've
been doing my hair for hours like I'm
I'm exhausted at this point like I
really am like tired alright so this is
the finale of it all so I was thinking
of maybe like I like it in the middle
part but I was thinking of doing like a
tap up type of thing starting me like
from right here to it right here
you know just do the crimps that gets
messed up like I'll just do those cards
over wish I think come here let me do it
see
it's pretty flat and look you I don't
know if you remember but I was saying
that I was looking for my hair that I
could find it kind of fun I've been on
my breasts this whole time so now I'm
just going to take it in I'm doing it
into this tight ponytail you know just
gonna pull it
tighten it up pull it and then I'm gonna
scrunch it with my fingy
oh I kind of don't even have to redo the
crimps but I think I'm gonna take a
piece of this party and just
wrap it over and deploy
all right I'm feeling really taking my
time and doing it so do you want it I'm
gonna go ahead and just carve out some
more for us to give it sleeker look
this is low-key like a more Jada
inspired because I seen her here I think
she has Crump's but it might I think she
do got cramps because her cutting looks
exactly like this yes the girl I stole
Joe Harris down you know I'm saying I
always like take her hair stealthily I
always I have like the screenshots a ton
of hair stuff that she actually has that
I'm gonna try so don't ever be surprised
if you see something that will merge
into how still a lot of people's
hairstyles honestly but I never really
do him but just keep like an inspiration
like I have this 613 air and I'm
thinking about doing that unicorn color
with it but I'm not sure but I still
have it just - I still have the picture
of her you can color just to figure if
I'm gonna do it enough alright you guys
so this is like this I can still see my
little part and I hate and we can still
see a little bit apart
it's like girl I could still see a
middle part
you can see it that bad but it's still
there so this is what the hair came out
looking like no I'm saying like yeah
wouldn't went through my mom's mother
comes there they ruin the party alright
alright guys so this is the final look
for this hairstyle hope you guys are
feeling it as much as I am like I said
again this is a full lace wig from royal
evany and this is kinky straight with
some one stomach once with my crimper I
like I said I brought this crimper from
Sally's it was like 40 it was like $49
but I gotta feel like 47 cuz I'm up
remember whatnot I kept checking it's a
lot of time and the best thing to do is
take off a couple dollars I'm gonna need
y'all to take off like 10% 20 I don't
know
anyways so cuz I'm trying at the back of
my hair dry anyways umm yeah so so far
I'm feeling this hair I did least and
asked myself y'all seen you do a little
big here it's like why ever need I'm
gonna give you guys a thumbs up yeah I
came through with a natural cap that
matched my Scout perfectly so be sure to
know when you do purchase away from them
you will get a cap that matches your
Scout perfectly my baby hairs on fleek
you know I'm saying I don't ever really
put my laces up in a ponytail because I
feel a they have that Whiggish look but
I happen to the points out and it's just
looking on points your hair crimped
perfectly I can tell that it crimps I
mean it straightens good as well cuz
when I ran my carpet do it mom I'm
recording wanna don't open my door
please
when I own love you but um when I ran my
crimper through it is straight and
really straight and then it crimps so
I'm no it straightens I know the curls I
probably straighten it later yo I'm like
