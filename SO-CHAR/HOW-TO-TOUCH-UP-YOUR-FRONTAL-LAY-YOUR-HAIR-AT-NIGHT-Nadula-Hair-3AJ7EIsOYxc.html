who you've I got me one the table hey
guys welcome back to my channel
alright so first things first is I want
to say that I did change my channel name
so it's no longer you love to start its
social yeah so that's my new channel and
be sure to be able to look up at old
videos or announced it socially our
birthday you love sure I know my
eyebrows look crazy right now everything
look pretty but I'm gonna be showing you
guys today how to basically touch-up
your lace frontals and basically if you
pay 200 or 150 or 300 to get your
friends'll installed why not just keep
one you know like pay for the initial
customization and all that and then
touch it up yourself but um don't try to
touch it up yourself and yourself
up cynical exercises to fix it that's
not what I'm saying I'm just saying I'm
just trying to teach y'all a way to save
some money so on it's gonna be hard for
me because I don't have my big mirror in
front of me as I usually do so I'm gonna
be working out of my palettes mirror but
basically if you can look into my hair
you'll see that the front so is somewhat
sliding back like I have baby hands
right here but the lace is actually back
here and as well for this side so I'm
gonna try my best to keep it minimal and
keep that frontal touch-up versus me
having to reinstall the whole thing and
if you guys are interested in how I
reinstall my hair I also have I also do
a video on that Souls I feel like it's
been forever since I was feeling like I
miss recording I'm actually gonna film a
makeup tutorial which I don't even do
ever really done but some of y'all asked
for it so I'm gonna do so first thing we
want to do is just like um I have a
socket man it's a clean sock but I ports
of alcohol on it and I'm just taking it
and I'm basically moving the baby here
and trying to clean off the glue all
that black stuff over there it's glue
and I'm just basically cleaning it with
my little sock
I'm gonna probably end up this is for
like this is basically just to get me
through this week but by the end of this
week I'll probably definitely show you
guys how I remove it and how I clean it
and how I reinstall it
so for those who are wondering this is
hair from not doula here or company and
I'm pretty sure they were Ellen first at
Express base but I think they have their
own website now but anyways this is here
from the doula care I've gotten I've
seen tons and tons of length of reviews
from not doula here and I guess they
steam the kids so they want to work with
the kids so thank you know do that for
choosing I was gonna say you love char
but lay spice shop alright I need to go
ahead and speed up this process in just
quickness up because actually I've been
cleaning forever even though my laces
slid back on this side in order for me
to fix that I would definitely have to
take off the whole unit so I'm not gonna
be replaying that back forward but I am
gonna be touching up some parts of lace
with my hair glue and just basically
getting it back to what it used to be I
love your baby ears right this part
right here this part very very important
it's very very it can't hit him for like
a foot jacked up maybe the size but
definitely not the front
alright y'all should see this was the
first time like did not act so now that
I've got that out the way
sorry now that I've got this off the way
I'm going through basically you can
clearly see like my hair still glues
down but as history possibly still needs
to be lifted it's so much harder not
having America's usually I probably have
my mirror standing up and then I would
be the one to just be looking into the
mirror being that I have to do stuff
with my hands and hold the mirror it is
pretty difficult so I'm gonna probably
post a separate video on the reviews for
this hair put on honestly it's like
picking up the baby he only has his
friends alone for like I'm gonna say
it's a weekend some days maybe a weekend
a weekend and that's why my playthrough
doesn't look as crazy as it would look
when it is time for a touch-up but one
thing I do recommend is on touching up
in front so as much as you can
I mean who wants to walk around with
their lace lifting up and looking crazy
like I prefer to think that you should
touch up your front school once a week
and if you don't do that then every two
weeks you just need to get the whole
thing ticking off everything on is so
crazy so um I'm gonna be laying my hair
down with my backup glue and this is
just a basic rule you should find this
on Amazon or Ebay um you can find that
some of your local Best Buy stores not
all of them I'm so sad because
but it should do so this glue is very
very very sticky all right so when
you're using this you need to be super
careful I'm gonna be applying it with a
little the little Hospital popsicle
sticks I'm still sad all right so a
little goes a lot like at school I
usually do two layers but this I already
have two layers on it I'm only gonna do
one layer let it dry and then reapply it
okay so I see it's right here like I
said it's really hard for me to do this
and hold the camera but so be it
I'm just applying the food right here
where the lace is lifted up and I'm
going to apply thin layers because okay
this sides now lift it up at all it's
just slip back but I'm gonna pull hot
videos forward so you can't tell and
it's another little section right here
that needs to be fixed as well
this is the house that you like for
those who uses it going into those who
don't eat people
carefully confuse so I'm gonna get these
to dry and then we'll come back in and
on basically on lay down my baby arity
shows all the easy part
so distance like super easy to such a
pure well priced at the reinstall is
what makes it a little difficult because
your stylist already had this set on
your forehead or certainly so you have
to pull it down like putting little
based vaccines and fix it alright so I'm
going to win a few more minutes to for
the hair to dry a Rachel so now I'm bad
and I have let the glue dry up is much
it's possible probably been about 15
minutes and press it down
it's a little bit tacky but it does take
a lot longer to dry pulling apart my
baby here's I already have the
preferences why don't I think I could
eat this for cold and film okay
so a lot of me taking my edges to brush
and I'm basically gonna just be combing
it and putting my edges back in order
and I'm going to be taking a beaker of
snot
I usually don't use this but I think I
use the purple one with the red top or
red with the purple top and to come out
at the color is lime cream but I bought
a different one today or yesterday I
Walmart because I was honey had so I'm
gonna be trying this one out this
semester it's not like toothpaste but
I'm pretty sure I've used this one
before
I really like this news but it's me -
you see my next
all right guys
so another thing now now that I have
touched up my hair and prepped it for
you guys no Stan you got it look at
almost brain oil basically it looks
brand-new
no I'm saying baby hands over here ask
you know I'm probably at the end of this
week I'll probably end up taking it out
you know I'm washing it and then I'll
finish it just how to do all of that
another part I want to include in this
video is that a lot of you guys come in
like what do I do to put my hair sleep
don't take off my way to I sleeping my
way on and that's been why I used to use
them got to be glue method I used to
always snatch my week off at the end
night and go to sleep
bold well not both the breakdown and I
go cowboy but now that I work and you
know who knows when I'll be able to do
my hair I don't really have time to get
up every single morning and glue it down
or got to be it down I use Raghu now
lately so I was using I was using
different scarfs and things of that sort
to to lay my hair down but now I'm not
really for that I also sometimes I
forget to tie my hair down and I go to
sleep with my hair or basically
everywhere but I wouldn't do that
anymore as well and so I was tying my
hair down with the banya and you know
wake up at midnight in your bonnet list
and your hair is everywhere
so I basically feel like I don't like to
wear my hair in ponytails when I go to
sleep because then that did out the
straightness of the hair so what I like
to use is this right here it is
basically a satin mesh
Rep and the reason why I recommend this
is basically it's all it's just going to
protect the front your hair and they
also come in two they come in a mesh one
and they come in a second one not a lead
on my baby hairs and whatnot your
tickets so I basically take this and
like the is basically like a scarf let's
get this Mir boom it's basically like a
scarf it's not too tight but it's not
too loose and you can adjust it to the
tightness that you want and I'll go to
sleep just I just
and I usually I'm gonna back out if it's
straight here I'll get it back on if
this come here I played it down but
that's how you made there down a night
time alright yo so that's it for today
now I'm gonna do my makeup tutorial I'm
gonna try my best to do this video
because it is gonna be difficult alright
y'all so that's all for today on this
video be sure to check out my upcoming
videos so I'm probably going to do a
flower routine and yeah that's all for
today bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
