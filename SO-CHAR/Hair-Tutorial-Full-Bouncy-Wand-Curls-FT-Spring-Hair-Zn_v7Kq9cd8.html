as promised I did say that I was going
to do a hair tutorial on how I achieved
this look and if you want to see how I
achieve this look and how I sort of laid
down my hair I got it wrong and Joe down
up here or nothing like that but how I
pressed down my hair to get it flat and
blending in with the hair then keep
watch so the first thing you're going to
want to do is just go ahead and part
your hair and split it in half that's
how I personally do it and I'm going to
get a brush and go ahead and dis hangul
my hair and just make sure there's no
knots or anything like that right now
the hair is like basically I just
natural state I haven't wanted it in a
while so these are just some old logs I
had previously now I'm going to take my
Garnier Fructis oil this is like the
best oil for me I use like pretty much
all of it but I just gonna put that
stuff on top of my hair I'm just going
to spread it all over my hair just to
give it so I don't know luster so it
doesn't dry out a burnout kind of using
it as a what do you call that tangles
that before you fly like a pretty heat
oil whatever so that's in a week or so
I'm gonna go ahead and roll that into a
ponytail or into like a little bun
just keep it out away while I do the
first set of my hair
and I'm gonna go back again and just
brush up the hair and just make sure
everything's perfect and ready to get
next thing I wanna do now is just part
my hair and just gonna go ahead and pick
them out by chunk I don't curl my hair I
don't curl my hair in smaller pieces
because I personally don't like how a
little depressing I wanted to be like a
bigger and fuller look so I actually
part something like biggest chunk so
that one hour probably partying at least
3 I'd say so what she's gonna do it I
mean I'm gonna be using the remington
wan curler and it actually goes from
bars to small at the top I actually got
this at Target for only like $25 or less
I don't remember but just around that
price so I haven't always set up to
400° yes I do have it that high and
that's just because I rarely do curl my
hair so when I do curl it it's either
you go how are you going home if you
don't want to fry out your hair I
suggest that you just go to like 350 s I
would say if you're gonna call your hair
everyday because after a while your hair
does start to burn out so what I do now
is I just go and I wrap it around you
want to make sure that you kind of have
a I want to say like you twist it as you
wrap it around over it being wrapped
around flat because when you do have it
flat straight across the wall curls will
come out more of like a curly sue type
of curl which I hate so I definitely do
it this way and then I hold it and after
that I just pull it and let it go
sometimes I'll probably like shake it
off some and be really really hot so I
just let it air awesome but that's
basically how I do it
so I'm going to be going again wrapping
it and twisting it around only all the
way to the tip and I actually bring the
tip like I wrap it around to that
closest to the edge like so there's like
a little string of hair that cannot be
cold then you're going to cut out for
like 20 seconds or so
that's that let it go pull it drop it
pair it out sometimes depending on what
my mood is if I remember it out so I'm
gonna be doing it on my side this time I
guess I decided to brush it I don't know
but wrap them in a row twist me keeping
it going to there and then I want to
hold it kind of counted out 1 2 3 4 5 6
8 9 10 7 whichever and keep going to
look like it's gotten enough heat
sometimes I'd touch the hairs might be
dangerous because I do burn my fingers a
lot so I touch the hair sometimes to
make sure that it's even hard then let's
go
pull it out
and that is basically just how a long
curl my hair just to see making it
bounce awesome
you
you
you
hey so I did go ahead and film the other
side of my hair off camera so now what
I'm doing now is I'm just basically
running my fingers through it and just
opening up the curls so and making it
come out bigger and more a little
fluffier and puffier and just teasing it
out some just to my likings and
basically that's just it and that's how
I get that look guys thank you guys for
watching if you like the video thumbs up

recordings but here it is thanks for
