help hey guys welcome back to my channel
so this is basically gonna be like my
two week update on this hair I purchased
this hair why I purchased it this hair
was sent to me everybody be asking me
did I buy the hair did you pay for this
hair or was it sent to you
does it matter does it matter phone
system you're not mind your business
mind your business anyways and I know
that's got the whole lot of rumor talk
about how hair companies be sending
youtubers better hair
stop damn true it's not true because I
ordered to hear from VIP before and I
told him I didn't tell them I was
a youtuber and they said with the same
type of hair they sent me previously for
free so what are you talking about
anyways this hair is from Kai I don't
even need it I'm coming off the book
rested and my face is be like alright
I'm coming off it and honestly that's
really not my character and I'm gonna
happen right now like I'm feeling this
beat and let's just get into this hair
so this is gonna be my two week update
on this hair and I'm wearing here from
Cartier
it is a website it's not Alex price
it's a website based company and I this
hair was sent to me and it came I think
from when I gave them my address is kind
of like the same as when they ship it
you know Aliexpress hair companies they
send their hair super fast and that goes
as well for other hair companies I don't
know if I could speak for more Jana's
hair company and small black companies
but most companies get their hair cheap
refunds
so this hair cans me in three to four
days after I reached it with my address
and I'm not sure if they super ship them
because they wanted me in her can make a
video but it don't really matter cuz I
make the video on my own time but this
hair was sent to me super fast and
something I gave him a dress they sent
me the shipping number the next fall in
morning in his hair was done here
two or three days after that it's great
and they do package their hair nice so
you can do like look on box review you
tuber so this hair is Brazilian curly
I'm wearing a frontal and three bundles
I was able to fit all three bundles to
the hair I'm wearing a 20-inch frontal
let me double check 22 24 and 26 and I
know I have a video on how I kind of
tamed my hair and get my curls to lay
flatter I know in my previous in stock
video I'll link that down below below
which is called watch me slay this
cutting hair dl was super big you know
super puffy and i wanna say i washed it
and after I washed it I didn't notice
that it got flat like this like I was
telling you guys that like one thing's
for sure this hair sheds a lot I don't
know if this because I cut the West I'm
still plucking the frontal but it's not
mainly the frontal that's really
shedding its many the bundles that are
like shedding when I wash the hair it
came soft the curl pattern is so pretty
everything was so pretty but as I was
running my hand through the wig like
literally I can just pull strands of
hair out so because of that the hair got
super thinner then what it was like here
I'll insert a picture right here and how
big it was and now it's basically to
this size I'm gonna go ahead and see if
I can pull some hair out like literally
I run my hands - and here comes out I
don't know if you guys can see this but
it's some here but that's that would be
the main thing about this hair the hair
doesn't tangle I can brush it off
lift my arm up the whole thing holding
up the hair the hair says that's the
only thing when I washed it no black
guys no brown dyes or not
like that read through it the hair is
soft it was pretty like right now I
don't have nothing in it but because I
just watched it this is just its natural
state with some water I put two braids
in it and this is what it's looking like
I honestly love this wig and good news
