26-inch I got it from shop drinking hair
connection it's in the 26 inch right now
it's boosted up as you can see but um in
a minute it'll hook up they get really
big and pretty ok so I already have my
edges spritz down and I'm gonna ready
now to put my cap on my head
all you need is a 10 ish or a no nude
cat to put over your head just to
protect your hair not really from
anything because I'm not putting any
glue directly on my hair besides my
hairline so even though I'm putting I'm
applying lace glue to some of my edges
none of it'll be ripped out because I've
already spritz it down all the way and
when I remove my cap I do take my time
for my lace I do take my time and I use
our call so my edges will be protected
I really do hope that you guys cannot
hear this lawnmower outside they are
really loud like I'm trying to make a
video so now I'm just gonna let it dry
and now we're applying the second coat
I'm gonna go ahead and apply the second
coat all around I'm not really gonna do
it on the back on camera it was very
very difficult for me to do the back so
I did as much as I could for you guys on
camera but it is best if you do have
some help like someone just to put the
glue align the back of your hairline so
it let it try now I had the lace ready
this is a full lace and I'm gonna start
putting it on from the back and and work
my way up now I'm pulling you forward
and I'm going to lay it on top of where
I glued there with my forehead skin
whichever oh you just want to line it
and make sure everything's right
now I'm laying my hair along the line
the glue line that I've created
now I'm touching everything just to make
sure everything's pressed down and all
the way down there are gonna be some
parts why I do have to read push it down
and make sure just hold it down for a
little bit just to make sure it fully
dries and that the lace catches the glue
and it decides to stick to your forehead
or your hand line whichever you want to
call me
alright so now I'm just gonna keep
adjusting it touching around and
pressing down everything just to make
sure it's fully glued on and inside
could I read align it so this is a
middle part and dudes look a little off
some parts you have to go ahead and
repress down because it lifts it up lace
glue is very very sticky but it does
take a little while to dry off
still making sure everything is just
perfectly and stuck down to my head now
after we fix this readjust that and
realign it now I'm pulling on my baby
hairs and I'm gonna do some plucking and
do some trimming as well this is just to
give it a more natural looking less like
thick thick hairs and from you and Plus
right now they are a little long but I
am gonna trim them down with an eyebrow
razor yeah I'm gonna be using an eyebrow
razor and also you can go ahead and plug
the hair that you haven't pulled out as
your baby hairs just to blend it and
give it more of a natural look like it's
coming out of your scalp type of look
I'm just gonna continue to pluck and
keep going to my likings
preferably I like my hair like this if
you don't you do not have to do baby
hairs I know that baby as it's like a
new thing right now with the laces but
you can do whichever one you like
however you like it baby hairs no baby
hairs however you like if you want your
baby or shorter you can do I'm shorter
if you want thicker you can pull out
more hair whichever one makes you more
comfortable now I'm trimming them with
the trimming them and tweezing them
fixing them call me please look how I
like it this time to do this side pull
out some hair sometimes if your hair
looks a little baby eyes they look a
little thin you can always pull them out
from the hair that you have push back
now I'm just trimming in German in
German
facing onto my legs
was all over my face 15 and it's better
also to use a razor razor comb or
anything like that because when using
scissors the cuts do come out more
hearts and unnaturally gonna be straight
across and no one's baby hairs I believe
straight across doing some more plucking
you can never mean you can't always over
plug the plug never hurts anyone unless
you plucking your eyebrows which it
hurts me every pluck I do kills me and
I'll never get used to plucking my
eyebrows ever so now I've plucked and
fixed it and now I'm gonna pull it out
show you guys how it looks see the top
and now I'm gonna take my comb and I'm
gonna go ahead and align the middle of
my part
and now I'm putting my hair and I'm
going to do two braids
I wouldn't call these braids out of no
Scout Brady it's just two cornrows or
somewhat whatever I call them braids on
the scalp braiding on his cab whichever
one I'm gonna go ahead and do two of
those this is the first that I'm doing
and then I'm gonna do my second side now
it is a little difficult to do this
because there is a lot of hair
everywhere but what you really just have
to keep in mind is that it's very thick
and it's not a thick hair so just take
your time part your fingers do as best
as you can and breathe best as you can
these aren't even my nicest braid
sometimes I'm afraid to be worse than
this or it be better than this every day
is different cuz I do have to fix it
every day cuz it does get a little
frizzy Jessie if I don't tie my hair at
night so now I braid them down just half
way not all the way and I'm gonna put my
hair up so now I can just come and braid
it into one braid to the back but I'm
gonna leave the insult I usually just
leave the ends out so they can blend in
at the bunch of my ears I usually just
leave off my think well I usually just
leave my ends out so they can just go
ahead and blend in with the hair that's
already out now I'm just braiding
so now I'm gonna be using my smooth
shine polishing curl activator mousse
and I'm just gonna be spreading it
around my hair and I'm also mixing that
with my Garnier fruit
I'm sleek and shine inside first serum
I'm gonna put that all over my hair just
to bring it like a little curl pattern
cuz right now it's just brushed out you
know buddy my fingers doing it making
sure the most gets in there I'm gonna
start scrunching it up just to make it
curl some more bringing the curl pattern
teasing it out it's what I'm just gonna
and now that was the end of my video
this is the finished look after if you
guys liked it comment below
anything else you want me to do just let
me know thank you guys for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
