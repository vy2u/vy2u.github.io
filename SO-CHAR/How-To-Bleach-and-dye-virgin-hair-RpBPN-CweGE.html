me you love sharp so today's video is
basically will be on how I keep this
color I said before that I was gonna
make a video bleaching my hair and show
you guys but I didn't so this time I
reached the hair and I did add some
color to it if you can notice it's kind
of like a reddish virtus orange look I
don't know like in the sunlight you can
see it looks like that as if it's like a
little bit of a pinkish tone but this is
the color that I got and I'm gonna leak
now everyone but um if you want to see
how I got this look if you let the color
and you want to see how cheap this hair
color then go ahead and continue
watching okay fine so these are the
things that you're basically gonna need
to achieve this look and these are what
I use this is here before I've even put
anything the first thing I'm gonna do
now is just keep my little container you
can get this entity to supply store and
as well as a bleaching brush I'm gonna
go ahead and go ahead and you want to
mix it around until it has like a sea of
like maybe like pudding but a little bit
more liquidy but not too liquidy but you
don't want it to be too thick but you
don't want it to be too
flattery please bear with me it is
really hard to mix the finger out with
this damn cup moving around and I'm
using only one hand because my other
hand is holding my camera so I'm just
gonna keep mixing it out and see I'll
just drop it and see how it's like show
you how I suppose job now stick okay so
that's the hair before I've done
anything to win this ready
so I've already brushed out there and
just laid it down flat though into like
at least three checks on top of each
other I haven't really thin so that I
don't have to flip it around and bleach
the other side I'll put enough that
it'll go straight through and the whole
side of the hair will be bleached I'm
sorry I thought that I was recording but
I guess you guys are watching mine or
with me I'm just gonna start working my
way from the bottom because I was when I
pleats my hair I always wanted to be and
also you guys are gonna see me like it's
like kind of Jaggi right now and that's
basically so that it's not a harsh
straight line it'll be like a blimp and
I'm gonna go ahead and go in my second
layer I just want to let you guys know
that between each layer I do wait about
five minutes and then give it a break
and then come back and continue
so
I'm wanna let you guys know the hair
does look load on that beast because I
mean when I start doing the jagged edges
and stuff the hair is kind of moving
because I don't have a really set on
anything so I kinda have to fix it when
I get off the camera and kind of do that
whole chalking thing right now and I
can't move the hair back so as you can
see the body is already getting lighter
and I think if I'm not mistaken I bleach
this about I probably did about three or
four layers of it so each layer I just
waited at least five minutes or so
alright so I'm back at it again just
jacking it see if you can see here this
is how it looks when I fixed it off
camera so I can I see hold the hair down
so that's how it looks and then I just
keep your hair from having that
straight-up bleach across and it just
look more natural like it's just dying
into it so that's how much of the air
I've gotten down so far I am actually
gonna go and wash it out now so I just
washed it out with some warm water and
just washed down make sure I got
everything out conditioned about
anything I don't comb it out or anything
like that I'm actually gonna wait till
our condition attacks to sit down but I
just feel like it's fun even
now I'm taking it and I'm going to put
it in the bag and the reason why my
doing this is because I just got my
nails done and I got them done in white
and when you dye your hair it does
bleach I mean that your fingers so I'm
gonna be using the color cherry cola
I had to mix two different brands but
that's the jazzing brand and the other
one is gonna be like kiss but they're
both called cherry cola so it kind of
gave me the look
I'm going to just squeeze them in the
bag I'm trying to keep it as clean as
possible cuz I really don't want to mess
up my nose they stain in my nose would
be like an ugly pink oh it will be ugly
but it won't be what I want and my
fingers as well my skin will be pink
which I don't like so I'm just quizzing
it into the bag and I'm trying to close
up the bag and then I'm gonna mm put in
another bag and I'm just gonna mix it
around just to make sure that the hair
the dye gets everywhere in there and
just mix it around doing it this way to
keep my nose clean and stuff like that
so that's basically how I do it I'm just
shaking up the bag I think it's
everywhere so now I left it for about 30
minutes and I'm now rinsing it out as
you can see the hair didn't really take
as bright as I wanted to and I think
that's kind of because I mix two
different colors but I still think it
came out with a great outcome so this is
what I washed the hair out of it and
like I told you guys before I do use
silicone to condition my hair so I
already have them I already have it in a
bag and I have some ice in there and I
use this to work on me
so after that are you deaf in our
business and now I'm gonna go
now you can see the time in this life
you can see a lot of the flow around
definitely where it dries up it's
definitely a third planet for active is
I just basically rinse it out air dried
it and hung it up and this was my
outcome and if you guys liked it go
ahead and give it a thumbs up thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
