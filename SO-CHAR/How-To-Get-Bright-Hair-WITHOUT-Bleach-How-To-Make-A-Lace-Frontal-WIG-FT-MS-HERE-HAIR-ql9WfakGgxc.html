welcome back to my channel so today I'm
going to be showing you guys how I
created this lace frontal wig and also
how I got it to be this bright color I
actually got this color without having
to put Bush on it or anything so if
you're interested in how I got this look
then keep on watching alright guys so
the first thing going to use your cream
developer yellow Yohai color highlight
and I got the color magenta your bundles
and also you'll be needing your lace
front so now I'm just going to be taking
the l'oreal high color highlights and
i'm going to be the squeezing it all out
into the container and i'm going to mix
it with a load of 40 developer i'm just
going to kind of go in and out and forth
much till i get it to my likings into
what i guess it's really supposed to be
I will say this when I usually bleach my
hair I usually take it apart out the
bundle and I spread it apart but I kind
of wanted the roots to be black on it so
this time I just left it in a ponytail
and I just separated the hairs and I
just went back and forth and that's
basically what I'll be doing throughout
this whole video is just splitting it
apart and going in and out through the
small hairs pressing it together and
just making sure that the L'Oreal hi
color gets everywhere on the hair
so basically I basically continue to do
this throughout all three of the bundles
alright guys so I'm so sorry I couldn't
even realize that you guys couldn't even
really see what I was doing but
basically I'm just part of the hair and
I just went side by side and I was just
going in and detail cutting it apart
splitting it apart just like that and
basically brushing it Josiah I had no
idea that I wasn't recording so I am
super sorry
so you can kind of see now on how I
bleached it if you kind of cool able see
but yeah on that side the left side you
can kind of see the finished side and I
just kept parting it apart it was sucky
because I really ran out so I did have
to re go to the store and buy another
one and read I because I did run out and
the color did not come out as bright as
I needed to be
you
ha
those lines are going down that's how I
fix the weak heart I don't know what
happened to the footage of me going down
the frontal but I'm going to show you
the frontal so down so you can kind of
get an understanding of what is the
pulse on the back I already go to my
first track on and I'm just going to go
by to show a little clip so it's pretty
simple when it comes to the track it's
kind of like
this one is looks like also the head you
know there is some food that still on
the cap but don't worry that definitely
turn it off now you're going to want to
go ahead and cut off that excess of the
dome cap you don't even need that part
anymore until so now that I have it back
on the wig you can basically see what
the wig looks like and that's what it
looks like all in one super easy so yeah
that's all for today guys so thank you
guys for watching ok guys so that is
definitely how I created this look
without any bleach and that is how I
make majority of my lace frontal wigs so
also this is hair from Miss her hair on
Aliexpress I am wearing right now I'm
only wearing two bundles a 26 and a 24
and a lace frontal and this is their
Brazilian straight hair so after I get
it
to wear it a little bit and kind of fill
it in I'll basically be back with a two
week update on this hair so for now you
guys just be patient with me and I'll
let you guys know how this hair is
rocking right so that's all for today
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
