life means I'm gonna go ahead and take
out work somebody here and I'm gonna
start successful here another okay so
this is all the year that ended up
getting out which is using less than
what I'm usually plug so I'm probably
going to end up love it for both

pretty much wrote down and stuff I'll
probably end up cooking in or when I
have it on and noticing it to my liking

handset and the baby will do come on up
