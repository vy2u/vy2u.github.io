I'm basically doing a video on how I
created this way so if you're interested
in this wing and how I made it then keep
on watching okay see you later hey guys
so to me this place with the frontal wig
I'm gonna be using a dome cap and right
now I'm just putting it on top putting
the lace frontal on top of the dome cap
and kind of positioning its in a way
that I'm gonna how I want it so I can
sew it down so now I'm going to go ahead
and just pin it down with some pins just
to have it all in place so I don't get
confused on where I'm sewing it I mean
yeah or where I'm pulling it down
I'm gonna go ahead and start slowing it
down by the end so I'm gonna slow down
from the very end corner and I'm just
gonna keep spoiling it and I'm gonna sew
one side and then this sew the other
side and then sew down the middle so
basically look like once you sew down
both sides and then sew down the center
so now I'm basically gonna just be
gluing the tracks literally one by one
I'm sorry that the camera does lose
focus but basically I'm gonna just keep
going it gluing it gluing it down until
I get to a certain spot when I get to a
certain spot I'm gonna actually change
the way I'm going it down
so now that I'm bout to the middle top
of the head I'm gonna now start
positioning the tracks and lengthen down
different and this you need to make sure
you do for the simple fact that if you
do not lay it down that way and you keep
going straight across when you put the
wig on it's gonna be very funky and it's
gonna be like you're gonna have like so
basically a huge hump in the back of
your head so laying it down this way
it's starting to lay down upwards it's
gonna basically have it laying down flap
and you'll have you a nice way without
no help
so now I'm basically at the plop and I
probably have one or two more taxes to
feel down and basically I'm gonna grow
it down and really hold it down because
I want this part to be very very flat so
if you so that's just something that you
should do whether you're slowing it down
or blowing it down you want to make sure
that that part right there is very you
can flat and seamless so basically this
is what your lace frontal should look
like once you've finished it and glued
all the hair together and yeah that's
how it should look so I'm gonna go ahead
and take it apart out of the ponytail
I'm pretty closer so you guys nice to
get a few so now I'm just gonna take the
hair and call me back and bling it out
so now we're back so now we're back now
we're at night the second-to-last part
you're just gonna want to go ahead and
cut the band of a where your look
lace frontal is laying right there do
not cut the opposite side of where I'm
cutting keep cutting this part just so
that band won't be on your forehead
which are they
so once use and that's a fun idea what
your lace frontal wake should basically
look like and this is it on my
mannequins is how and that's basically
how I created my lace front wig
okay guys so that is the end of that
video I hope you enjoyed it and I hope
it was very helpful to you because I
watched a lot of videos on how I make
well how to make lace wait so why not
make one the first one I made came out
really good so why not make one and kind
of show you guys learn how I learned so
this is the hair and stay tuned for my
install video I'll probably have a link
down below by the time it's posted okay
