Cousineau down tree you know it
hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to make your big-haired
as of right now my baby here is or not
please at all so I'm going to show you
guys what I do to make some baby here of
course you will need a toothbrush that's
like the main key and also some also
some gorila snapped just start brushing
the air you ever know without having a
super long piece is kind of like equip
it and break it down so like right now
I'm going to push this besides login
just show you what I do
alright I'm going to start in this
section right here it's gonna be why I'm
gonna say by three just about resuit so
here get in and from seeing like I'm
Sarah my snob and hair everything
alright
I'm Emily like to my little paper so
chunk so will difficulty could you
rather for something this is little good
if it also helps you to kind of hide
your waist if you see it changing colors
because of my foundation and my turn
will panel would not as good as any
great so that's the first one done a
little lightish lining that crap already
be playing our next thing to do is part
the next section I've got this new way
of doing my thing here's what I got had
like some big hair coming up right here
I've always kind of wanted that hair
line we're more here come out here I
don't know that hair lines me is iooks
over pretty good
I want it last with it so you know what
I did I'm eight and you can make it too
yeah cuz I got pretty basic
so start them right here kind of God is
it your fingers see that something you
want to make sure you kind of curve it
up some so it doesn't get in the way
with uh new to this foundation so it
doesn't get away with the first piece
that you did and then try to throw in if
it's really long just like beautifully
physical theory don't worry let me show
you guys how to fix this
three so and the first be very promising
given executive get napkin and just turn
it over and just go down with it to
conquer me though the thing about it is
like either way when we do before you do
your foundation or after I like to do it
after because I feel like right clean it
up
I let's do it after because I feel like
when I do it before I do my foundation
it'll have like a residue show me
so that basically how I made this sign
and see you I mean like this long piece
like I really don't want to cut it so
I'm just going to try to write Joe it
down with the baby here I'm saying right
if you for those who don't have no edges
you really got to get your friends away
all right and this is sometimes I find
myself not being able to hide the line
this is like the grooming time the glue
dries white so quick tip for when that
glue dries white
let me just get you from their
foundations Paris I'm just gonna take a
kitchen step another see this cabinet
enlightening it kind of goes away it's
kind of like how to blend your basis oil
so this is the last part is that's for
these little extra hairs right here this
is like my face apart and this is
possible didn't thing that I do so click
on a miss any channels that you can kind
of see it this is the techniques that
are you I've seen other people use as
well but this covers the line in your
leaf sometimes you know we can't cover
it we did the best we can we put that
considered I don't know compare thing
with you know other rightful that the
issue here
just type it give you that little food
when you when you cook it in - right
here will repress it and get my napkin
and go over it cuz their foundation do
not put them oh look as you can see the
donation jar up nicely you can see you
after I wipe down now I'm gonna go over
if you make sure to put this into Martin
and kind of adjust okay with this way to
if you put so
clean it up so boom that's how I do my
baby here all right so this is basically
how I'm going to lay my frontal I'm
gonna take a little bit of just got to
be glue and this is like hard laying it
this is how I like my hair look
especially when I got my middle parts in
I just wanted to look natural into this
life - should I be pushed back a little
bit so I take a little bit of got to be
glue and I couldn't like gel it back and
if you don't put in the boys are gonna
fill that back you don't need to put
that much gel
see that
so now I am gonna take you can use a
scarf
whatever I got this damn piece of fabric
back when I thought I was comfiest so
much that I love making clothes we have
an attorney feel kind of like when you
things through here to push it back home
and you know take your scarf like a
little piece of fabric just going to tie
it
so now after a few minutes or just let
it drag just enough BAM
yeah so as you can see it's pushed back
a little but not too much in my edges
are crisp like now what I do is like
thick bio spoken of it take a little bit
and just do this and I cannot waste
another thing on this ever you guys like
where are you
and below I'm just gonna press it down
my career and just sprinkle over the
hair a little bit um I think that I have
a bit of a lot of baby hairs on some
people like to look more natural and
some people about that baby hair effect
I personally love the big hair fake this
is what is it sometimes this is exactly
what am I do to lay my lace frontal is
playing a lady here alright guys I hope
