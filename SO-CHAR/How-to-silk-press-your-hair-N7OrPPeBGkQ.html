today I'm just doing a little simple
video and this is going to be how I get
my hair done bone straight how I get my
hair done how I get my hair bone
straight so if you're interested in how
I got this look and you want to see how
I did it go ahead and just keep watching
okay bye well not buy but continue
watching right now the hair is in its
natural state I washed it and just let
it air dry haven't really done much to
it besides that no oil or anything is in
the hair I just washed it and glued it
on so I don't have a hair tie so why do
have hair ties it's just when I need
them they're like no way to be found so
what I'm going to do is just part my
hair into tubes
I'm just gonna go ahead and pull it down
the middle of my finger and put it into
tubes and I'm just going to hold the
hair with my mouth I don't know my hair
clips are so what you do is take a chunk
we're not even chunk but a small piece
edges look fried I'm gonna go literally
I just go like small pieces small piece
so I just take it twist this around and
having difficulties so I have my flat
iron on the headlight it kind of busted
up but I have a regular absolutely
clutter and I actually have it turned up
all the way to 400 everything just fall
and ruined my video all right
but ho now so first thing that you want
to do is click your comb or a big of
here I don't have to use this but I use
this just to get that sleek shine look
this is what I'm going to use just go
my work involved
oh great
just grab another chunk of your choice
you
I'm going to get a hair ties
see I so penis
I can't wait to drill down these edges
why do they look like that cut up
another piece it up
so now that you guys kind of have like
an understanding of how it's basically
done I'm just going to go ahead and
speak
so the last final thing that I'm going
to do is I'm going to go ahead and jail
down these nappy edges and I'm using of
course a toothbrush and gorila snot I'm
not too sure if anyone has been put on
to this but this is kind of like edge
control but a gel version but so much
better than actual edge control it works
for me so I just scoop a bit on here you
know this is a brand new toothbrush had
to get into one the other one after a
while for those who do do this after a
while you do notice that the tooth brush
starts to get too clumped with all that
stuff so basically I'm just pulling it
out some freaking it out turn that baby
in there and that's how I just slick
mine in there nothing off the ordinary
just a little swoop in and I'll take
some more and get the PD top up here
this patches
I just might pull a little bit out this
thing is messing with my makeup
don't y'all hate that that's why what oh
my god oh my god
I'm supposed to do it first
just not to my hair like I'm gonna bald
or something so that's basically it and
that that you know you don't want to use
too much but I use just the right amount
and I just basically go over everything
have that slick shine look and this is
how I get my hair bone straight and I
press my hair hope you guys enjoyed this
video to all my new subscribers welcome
into those that are subscribed what's up
I'm gonna be posting up some new videos
this week as well and also I have
something to say why did I forget it
give me a sec yeah okay I remember but
um oh come on
forget it just forget it by the way this
is actually that same hair that I was
using that spring hair I actually dyed
it back but I can put it back in um the
other hair is you nice that you nice
hair with the bob just not fill in the
color right now so I'm actually going to
just dyed a different color in it and
then put it back in
oh that's what I remembered so if you
guys like my t-shirt let me get up a
little bit show you this is a it's kind
of got some spring bead right here I
don't wanna get it all the way too much
because I don't have one pants um if you
guys like this shirt I do have a
tutorial on how I made this shirt and it
is on my youtube channel so I'll link it
