to be doing an instant video on this
hair and this is hair from sunlight hair
company on Aliexpress this hair was said
to me and as well this is deep wave and
the vendor she did tell me that this
hair was eight eight deep wave hair but
she did not mention what type it is so I
definitely by the time this video is up
I'll have down below the links to the
hair and what hair I got in the kind of
hair that this is so I made this into a
lace frontal way and the frontal is a 22
I'm sorry a 20 inch deep curly frontal
and the bundles are 224 and a 26 I so
far I have deep condition my hair I did
show you guys a video on how I bleached
my friends'll so I also open each this
frontal in particular so I also have
that link down below and so far I'm
really really loving my hair like this I
got enough of these braids as you can
see it looks super natural the front so
police very very nice I have it up in
these two gradients super human other
plays a little girl so yeah that's how
I'm rocking it right now this is my
first day wearing it and um earlier
today I this print that I just ran my
fingers through it wet it up some and
got it wet and ready and I didn't have
it government then just straight up so
this is what it looks like dried with
all the stuff on it it's not heavy
alright it's not dry it doesn't feel
rough or anything like that this hair is
just super pretty what I did cry didn't
cost before
and I would say that what I Co watched
it it did get some knots in the bundles
but besides that after I washed it I
didn't get any more knots so so far this
hair is like super pretty it's like
super big and doesn't really I don't
have like much product in it and it
looks very very nice it's dried up it's
big and I love it it is super like long
for a 24 inch like it comes down to my I
would say like around my hip area so
it's pretty good
um shipping was really fast I'm not I'm
pretty sure like when the company's
reached out to me to order here for them
I think the shipping on based off
whether they're sending me the hair or
someone else is biting to hear from them
are pretty sane they tell you the day
they ship it are all those how you will
hang we just shipped out your package
friend and all that and then in a couple
days your packages here in Seoul like
all Express vendors they're fast
shipping and the hair is a long time and
on clean the hair did not have a bad
order when I watch seeds you didn't run
anything brown so there wasn't dyed this
is the natural color I am depending on
if I'm going to turn this hair to like a
reddish color I'm not too sure on if I'm
going to do so yet but I do have that in
mind so if you guys like a video on it
comment down below on it you know if you
guys want to see how I style this
frontal and other styles just let me
know in comments down below and I'll
definitely do that for you so I'll be
back probably in two weeks with a two
week update on how this hair is doing
and if there's anything I don't like
about it and doing anything like that
but so far it's pretty good it's fairly
shedding it's not nodding it's my first
day of course but it will see you in two
weeks
so that's all for today guys thank you

new subscribers and I hope
Strawbridge thank you guys for
