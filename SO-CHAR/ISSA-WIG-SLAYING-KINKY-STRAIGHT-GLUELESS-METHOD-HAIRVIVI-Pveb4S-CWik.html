today I'm going to be doing a tutorial
basically on this hair install so I got
this hair from hair Vivi this is a lace
front wig and it is in the inches 22
inches and it is kinky straight as you
guys can see I applied completely
pressed it out so it's not like beyond
straight but it just looks like some row
natural hair so if you guys are
interested in this video and interested
in how I got this look then be sure to
keep on watching bye bye guys well shut
up Robert alright Shaw so the first
thing that I'm gonna start doing is
basically plucking out the frontal the
front will already came with a natural
hair line but I just want to pluck it
some more and just get it to my liking
it's a little bit more make up here the
hairline part just too full I'm just
gonna take my tweezers in then that out
and as you can see like I'm placing my
tweezers throughout the hair and just
plucking that way
and I'm just going to separate this
chump
all right so I'm gonna go ahead and now
just cut off the ear time so once again
this is hair by hair Vivi and the hair
did come already pre plucked so I mean
yeah I'm pretty close but that's not I'm
gonna say the hair came already when
it's not bleached as you guys can see so
that was like a plus for me um out
should you stab my eye so I usually
don't ever wear full lace wigs or lace
front wigs that are already come aid I
always usually just make my own custom
wigs with frontal and bundles but this
was sent to me already made so this is
the lace part it's a lace front and um
the party faces on to right about here
so it might just be about 5 inches let
me take the sides
yeah the side part is a little shorter
so that's another thing about these lace
fronts um you don't really have that
much parting space when it comes to the
side but it does tend to go a little
more back but today I'm not really going
to be focusing on that I'm gonna just
try to press it out and see how straight
this kinky hair can get I'm just gonna
go ahead and do some more plucking up
here this is how it'll look if I decided
to wear it in the side part and I'm
gonna also mention to you guys that this
wig is did come with adjustable straps
so I can't wear this glue this which I'm
going to be doing today so it comes with
some straps and it comes with the band
so I can pull it off and put it on and
off at night alright so I'm just gonna
go ahead and um part the hair
I don't usually part my hair with this
comb is actual better comb so hopefully
I think it is kinky are supposed to give
off a look it is stammering kinky is
supposed to give off a actual black
girl's hair basically like that you have
been blow-dried and all that good stuff
this is which I guess it really really
looks like but a straighter version yo
I'm trippin with this party I'm telling
I can't do it without my good thing
honestly I'm like really stuck on nice
how easy this wake is like no bleaching
minimal tuck in so this is what the wig
looks like off and as you can see I've
already put like my foundation inside
not my foundation but my foundation
powder you can use any powder to your
skintone and I'm just putting a little
bit just to make it more of my tone all
I do is take my powder in a powder brush
and I just jab it in there just like
this and I just blend it in there the
lace comes already a nice color so you
probably won't have to do that but this
is a step that I'd love to take and this
right here is the band that's gonna be
holding on your hair so it holds it down
so you don't need any glue or anything
like that I'm gonna go ahead and just
put the band on
put it on with the band so now you just
adjusted and I've already caught off the
ears and you guys saw I'm gonna go ahead
and just cut off the lease and begin
this so late you always just want to cut
in like the zig zag didn't go all in one
new like area you don't want it to be
cut straight across now that I've cut
the lace off I'm basically just going to
be taking I'm going to be doing this
glue this method so you're gonna be
taking some of my fries tax braid and
I'm just going to spray over my cap in
areas of that such just ours right here
right here
places where the wig is going to go on
and as well as right here right here
right here right here alright so and
then I'm just going to this free time
spray this dries pretty fast and I
wanted to have really like a tight hold
I just wanted to have a hold so that's
why I'm doing this step
pressing it some more so basically you
can't even see it and this is without
any boon just a little bit I've got to
be free tax breaks snow yeah that's what
I just did and now I'm gonna just take
my headscarf oh I'm gonna do my baby
house first
so I guess what I'll do right now is I'm
gonna just go ahead and start pressing
it out and I'll just start with this
side all right yes in the meantime I'm
on my side and he's set up I'll just do
a couple of baby hairs I'm not gonna be
too much and they're really funny a
little baby rightly so we're just gonna
draw a few
I'm going to be taking my belly flop and
we are side effect using my brother snob
and I'm just using the green one I think
the name is Gavin over and I'm going to
shirt it's the green one though green
and purple all right just some basic
baby hairs right here I'm gonna zoom in
for you guys just a little baby here
right here I like to do just about three
about three
and sometimes I take my throw spot
intersects give it a spray with the
ghost ghost pond they got to be glue for
you stack spray that just gives it a
like extra hold
you
all right so this is what it's basically
starting to look like right here and
right here I'm gonna go ahead and just
go in my Freitag straight just like that
I'm gonna go through the hairline and
I'm just dabbing my fingers into it
pushing the lace in I'm gonna go ahead
and take my slips court and I'm going to
tie it down and let it dry for like five
minutes
all right so while they do that I'm just
gonna go ahead and begin to press out
the here I'm gonna do this side first
all right so I'm just gonna take this
piece it's so big like the youth like
fluffy I'm gonna take my comb to trace
and I'm just going to pick it up and
Christo and I have my Flatiron turned on
to 450 here I'm just gonna take my hair
off the way and just pin it up on this
side and then we'll basically see how
straight tikis trinkets
hmm it gets pretty shrimp all right so
this is basically when I'm kidding
it gets pretty pretty straight I'm gonna
throughout this I'm gonna just
constantly run my hot comb through the
hair because it's kinky straight from
the roots so if I don't do that
I'm gonna prove my neck it won't lay
flat right dang a paramedic bad I guess
for this do all right so I'm just gonna
go ahead and speed up this process and
keep on going
and it's basically helped the front out
a whole lot and made the hair basically
lay down really relief that nice like it
looks really good
so now I'm just going on continue on
pressing it out the hair is getting
pretty straight it all really really
resembles like my real action where like
it has like a whole lot of texture to it
basically
alright guys so I've now fully flutter
on one side of the hair and as you can
see it is full this here must have been
previously died or something connected
as you can see like it's like super dark
and I'm not complaining like I
personally would have ended up dying
this hair jet-black to be honest like
just something about dark hair really
really brings out the face simek's
I don't know what it does to it I like
it so this is what it looks like and um
it probably stops below my breast I'm
not really used to wearing hair this
link I'm used to wearing like 26 and up
but it is nice it looks super natural as
if it could be like my real hair like I
really really am a feminist so far so
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other side
and then I'll come back and finish and
show you guys the final results of this
case right here so yeah alright you guys
so this is what it looks like fully
pressed out I feel like this is
literally just my role here and I have
like a washing set going on type of
theme I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna
do like uh maybe put it up like half-up
half-down antipathy because I'm always
wearing my hair just in a regular middle
part so I'm gonna just do it like that
and do what 1/2 a tester
just to a little girl with this sound
like this but I like you I could either
have it look like this I can also have
it up in a ponytail like a fun let me
see how it looks with a bun I never
really did this one look hmm
so I just keep it up like this well you
got that shirt for one more anyways mmm
