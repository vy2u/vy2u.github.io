never not wanted but yes from dad I knew
of Dallas I got into making YouTube
videos by um doing hair views I did my
first hair dolls in like tenth grade and
after that I stopped for a little bit
and then I decided like I'm gonna taking
my channel more serious and like I'm
gonna say almost two years ago I kept
going so that's why I'm at now no I
don't ever want to stop doing YouTube

can make two ways off that this is my
first time ever using it today on this

perfect for this so I'm gonna have two
different sizes the wigs going on
right now I live in Miami Florida I got
to go buy bitty how often should a
person restock on here I think you

need the whole thing how was March Queen
here March Queen here was my screen here
was whatever to me like I personally
feel like I had washed I didn't co wash
the hair so maybe that would have been
while I was like that but it had a type
of feeling to it like it was something
in it like it wasn't fully washed out or
something and it got kind of like tingly
every like every couple minutes you have
to comb through it with a brush run your
fingers do it it's like that the best
food place in Miami I'm not gonna say
finger lickin finger licking it's
overrated like freshening all that it
should have full of grease crime man 305

bet to me restaurant Benihana and I'm
pretty sure Benihana everywhere but I'm
not gonna give it a finger licking like

uncomfortable have you ever been to New
York yes I've been to New York I was
actually I went to New Jersey in October
this year that was a fee that's the
place I was actually thinking about
going Aveda I've seen a lot of people go

giveaway like next week I'm waiting for
my hair to come in welcome I need to do
that midnight blue again because when I
did it on my weave it was a whole story
but like the front the bundles like the
way came out straight the color came out
straight but like right here like my
roots
I had ended up bleaching the whole
frontal to like a number four so after
that then I decided I was just gonna do
a blue but it's hard to like color the
color to the root without getting it on
the lace so I was real scared about that
so I came up freaking weird I came not
too weird you think I go to vehicles of
America
they look okay to me don't look shiny
the girls like be called dick I don't
know I don't know do y'all girls like to
be called thicker no

was bullshitting that day so I was just
trying to be rude well I actually did
put some spritz in some fries tax break
but I was still trying to be gents we're
not getting on the routes but what I'm
gonna do is the next time I do it I'm
gonna put a lot of freeze tax break and
just harden it so even if it does touch
it it'll wash right off so what's the
best advice you would give to someone
who would like to start doing YouTube
videos um my best advice no I'll just go
for like if you if you like YouTube as
much as I do like I don't just get on
here make videos and post videos like I
watch other people too like I said on
YouTube a lot just do it like if you
think you're doing you comfortable to do
it do it it's fine you'd be nice to ride
me okay explicit material thank you
by Billy I'm saying would you pick
Charmander or squirtle I don't know what
that is I'm glad y'all love watching my
videos thank you
hi thank you
this life is going on long like I don't
even know like I'm always gonna get
online not to get on my phone and I just
upgraded to the new iPhone so my camera
nice let me show you on my old phone
this is my old phone they can screen
Roberts go Robert did this alright go
Robert
did this to my phone this is my old
phone but I'm actually gonna turn this
into like my business phone no it's not
I can get the iPhone X I got the eight
plus do you have any celebrity crushes
yes I'm on currently dating Drake and
also I have been chatting up with um
quavo from the Beatles
I'm a come on live more than I you know
I used to save my laces pique mill oh my
god I love it I've actually did someone
who hair who had alopecia early on girl
she actually I complained to me about
itching or anything like that so I'm not
too sure on the itching part but
alopecia is like made for it's like
perfect like I'm it's not perfect to
have with my same but like with lace
frontals enclosures and wigs like
doesn't even matter like for all some
people know I
have alopecia I'm always wearing wigs
like with his life but I don't know
anything about the itchiness I don't
know hey I missed y'all - I said - I
said mess it up only I'm dead what'd I
miss
what did you do where do you buy I don't
buy my hair and this hair is from the
earth we are best hair on Amazon yeah we
could be friends
yes you're such a beauty oh my god all
the way from the UK Wow um the hardest
part about being a hair stylist I mean I
guess not being able to please everybody
I've come across maybe one or two people
who wasn't really pleased by my work and
it don't really bother me cuz you know
you can't please everybody but it's kind
of like you might rethink like oh maybe
I don't know what I'm doing maybe it's
not for me but did I be like a business
turban or maybe I'm just not a cup of
tea yeah I love quavo and Drake that's
one BA hey oh hey do you smoke deep
detectors no I don't know do you like
smoke detectors okay I'm a block Pokemon
um I'll go ahead and block Pokemon
nobody never fits right you make it a
little small when you before you saw
your wig down and easy like if the cap
say this is a wig hair in the cap stops
right here the frontal needs not the
face but the actual hair starting on the
frontal should be like two inches above
it above the dome cap or whatever cap
you use hey Brianna oh my god was
somebody purpose I don't
I don't know who called them who call
them yeah definitely we'll all I do is
break my hair and put wigs on and my
hands grown so much I've cut off all my
perms in all my perm ends my hair is
growing very very nice like I was
debating when I took off my weave and I
took a little break from leaving stuff I
was debating on me if I should get a
permanent cuz I noticed how long my hair
was but I said no I'm gonna keep on
braiding
when are you stuck in your hair
collection don't ever leave you to begin
please I leave for a couple days go
ahead it's nice that wig and I'm
restocking this week I'm just waiting on
my shipment to come where are they
coming from I don't know like fresh my
mother nice I love you China girl thank
you I love you so I can clear my Florida
love you too
um I just think the most advice I could
say is if you don't have a quality hair
I don't know what advice I would say cuz
I'm just starting but quality hair is
key like that song say like quality hair
is key why should they be to the front
so should be 2 inches above the dumb cap
because if it's not in the frontal when
you cut off the extra cap it's gonna be
too small for your head so it's not
gonna fit your head so it should be
about 2 inches above the cap I am gonna
do vlogs I started a vlog channel but I
just post blogs on my regular channel
love you too princess B love you too
Kiana RKO Nia Casey oh my god here go
another perv let me

thing cuz I might have been wearing this
thing that's the only thing I've ever
used how do you stop me from turning
white we made not a friends who you're
supposed to apply a clear thin clear
you're supposed to apply one thin coat
and let it dry clear and then you apply
another coat and let it dry clear and
depending on how many coats you put and
you just always put a thin layer because
if you put chunky pieces it's gonna
summer be clear and then some of the
white yeah it turns white when it gets
old and that's just time to do a touch
of mime in that's the same thing with
ultra hold your own turns black and I
rather die rather turn white then black

gang you've been when you use clothes
for my installs last for eight to ten
days with proper maintenance and without

Edge's acting from the game or
discarnation every skin uh yeah it's not
the discoloration from your skin it's a
ten all right it's not discoloration
it's a ten when you sit in the Sun all
day with being sue your skin starts to
get dark on the outside but where your
skin is covered that starts to stay
light to the original color so that's
what happens
and basically it's like though it
happens on a basin so when you're when
this part of your head is covered all
the time
of course your face is gonna get dug
through all this part stays lighter and
your edges do thin out that's why you
gotta some people just gotta give it a
break like if they about that life

changed my hair a whole lot so that's
the only thing about it but people who
do get that lace done every now and then
