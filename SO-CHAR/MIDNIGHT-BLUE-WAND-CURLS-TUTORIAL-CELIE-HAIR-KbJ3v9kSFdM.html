villain and lately you say you lucky pin
me flat but can keep me from looking so
crazy come in at 6:00 in the morning
hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing a tutorial
and this is gonna be a long credit Oriya
tutorial what so this hair that I'm
wearing right um I need more stuff but
this hair that I'm wearing is from City
hair um they do have their own website
and they are also an expressed based
website so I'm gonna be doing a tutorial
on this hair I'm also gonna be showing
you the beginning of how I got this
color so I'm gonna let that part play
right now
okay so now that you like to basically
see Tom I got the colors a stop to that
I brought makes all three guys together
I plan ahead and let it sit for about I
want to say I'm at the die state for an
hour so I did beat him to trying to get
it to the widest point and then I took
that color over it so just add to that
no and now I'm basically taught to be
wrong from a sister I'm gonna split it
in two
this is to tell you guys the links so
I'm wearing a 20-inch frontal in the
bundles are 22 are 26 26 and 228 its
what I'm wearing it is like so difficult
to Wan curl long hair like this but I'm
gonna give me a gold damn here another
blue so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna just run some Moroccan argan oil
soak you stir them on it just give it
some luster guys I don't know if I told
you guys but last week I had water
damage on my laptop I spilled freaking
anyways I split that on my laptop so I
went you got it big they charged me a
whole bunch of money I paid it and even
that top I got takes and now I was on it
yesterday and sprinkle and I don't know
why but after that I just shut it off
and I could have back on and then the
folder where the question mark kept
popping up and I went online and I told
me the steps I take to fix it
I didn't said I can't work I call the
people that fix my computer they told me
to bring it in because I am still on a
three-month warranty with them break the
retard but yeah so I did everything that
I needed to do and I know but it started
back working again and all of a sudden
to stop again and now it's tripping are
you actually able to upload a video log
that I visited but I didn't have the
cord to do it so now I do so I'm just
praying some black vanilla it's by
Carol's Daughter it's the leave-in
conditioner and it's for FRA it's perf
right it's for dry dull and brittle hair
it says it replenishes moisturize and
proves manageability ends at sunshine it
has aloe vitamin B and wheat protein I
just like said you know the best key to
keeping your hair looking good is - I
really like you cuz it's lovely but this
is my first time actually using it so I
took the tester all and I'm gonna be
putting heat towards the ears so I just
want to give it something but yeah I
don't know I've been trying to get my
laptop to cut back on it shut off the
kids name
lit it I hate having it in a split the
two pieces in I just see this one
would you guys feel about this makeup
like honestly I know it's what you guys
like you guys want me to do more
tutorials I will but I just posted up a
nice tutorial it everyone can ov you so
like I don't think you don't want to see
my repositories but anyways I wanted to
do look since my hair is loose on my
lids are blue and I am wearing a shot so
sharp means these are inner can you
guess the salaries no these are in the
style shower so be sure to follow my
Instagram it's Charlene forever and be
sure to follow my snapchat and shiny
forever and also Photoshop stone so sure
lashes online shop so sure lashes on
Instagram as well because I do update
like potato split my lashes and how they
look and you might be able to start
seeing other people with them on campus
I sold out of the other stuff but I have
like two probably just like three more
in stock of the stop shop so sorry I'm
actually gonna be restocking every
something with new pairs but I don't
think I'm gonna restock in the style
Lyra because I only saw one stuff those
so I tried to get you guys something
natural and it's like you're not feeling
the natural so if y'all want to be all
glam didn't we can be all glam but I
will keep the mirrors that I have left
online and available for purchase and if
I get requests to bring it back then
I'll bring your bag putting this new one
it's the ones that go from skinny to big
and this is the Hot Toys one and I have
it all out for 50 all right
you I'm only gonna do one side of my
head on camera bounty this is pretty
sure that I'm just gonna do this whole
roll for you guys and then I'm gonna
speed up the process like you kinda have
an ending
I knew this wasn't catchy have a seat
over here
I used to love no one make something
from my hair am i blue
my screen just turned off on my computer
and a whole day just with the street
so which you suppose is a dump in your
head and hold it with it gonna go bad I
just fell asleep
you're supposed to just drop it in your
hand for a little bit and hold it in
I bet you mean I'm gonna do the math
make sure you're like twisting with hair
as your reprimand because if you don't
it's gonna kind of come off like candy
clay oh my word I feel like disappear I
probably shouldn't have a fuckton
lighter and I should probably change
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and speed up
the process so y'all get it
all right so I'm back and up now
completed both sides oh my god thanks to
Google my hands like from the blue
I'm uh I'm going to be taking small mice
observe and I'm just going to run into
my head is here I did go undergo some
tea so now I'm going to tease out what I
like to do is I just like I just pulled
them from the ends
I'm having a comeback here forever and
you know I always wear my hair straight
it's don't fit for this tutorial hope
