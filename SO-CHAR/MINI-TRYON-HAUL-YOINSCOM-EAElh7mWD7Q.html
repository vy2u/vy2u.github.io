today I'm going to be doing a little
clothing Tryon hauled with a company
named joins so this is a China based
company so you know their sizes do go a
little up and down but if you guys were
interested in purchasing from this
company
I've already showing off some of our
items so you guys will basically see how
the items fit on me and decide whether
you need a bigger size or a smaller size
yeah so I got a few things from them
first thing I'm going to be showing you
guys is this jacket so this is just like
a fur coat jacket and believe it or not
I really cuz you know if you like a hit
or miss purchasing from these websites
but this Jackie was actually really
really soft like it's it looks real real
cute but it's real nice I've never ever
had a car coat before and I've always
wanted one so this is what it looks like
right here and that's basically how it
looks in one I think it's super super
cute and I remember excited like right
now I'm in Miami so it's like hot as
hell so I don't think I'm wearing
anytime soon but definitely wanna get
colder if I travel I definitely have
that one okay so the next item I got is
just this two-piece set and it's kind of
like an off to shoulder type of thing as
you can see I asked for this in a medium
but for some reason they sent me a large
so the top part is really really big
which I only I think I'll just take it
in with like some needle and thread no
biggie
and then the bottoms are these and I
think honestly the bottoms is well are a
little too big at the top their largest
is really to run large
so this is all three said I asked for
medium but they sent me a large so
whatever if you guys are my size or even
smaller if you're smaller than me if she
got a small if you're on my side you
definitely need a medium okay so the
next thing I got is like this open I
didn't fix it all the way it's just this
latex dress the top is mesh and the
bottoms the top is mentioned the bottom
is like latex and it's black honestly I
love this dress like I didn't think that
I would end up liking it
but I really do like it it is a bit
short and the zipper does all the way to
the neck but as you can see on me I
didn't have it zipped all the way to my
neck because I didn't have no one here
to zip me up and I couldn't do it myself
this fits pretty well like at first
you're gonna see it and be like oh my
god like I can't squeeze it into this I
got some stuff on it I really don't even
know what I got on it you're gonna see
it and be like oh my god I cannot
squeeze into this but surprisingly you
really can like guy I got into it and
not go space in it and as you guys know
only the outer part is leather and then
the inside is this satin material which
is pretty nice and it's super stretchy
it has this nice silhouette going in the
shape of the Formica no Coca Cola Cola
bottom shape I really like this dress on
I won't wear this dress out maybe a war
where I don't know I'll just take some
nice pictures in it after the BPO of
course because what is good I can't go
anywhere or I can't go put it good
I'm not gonna wear stuff like this and
then the next outfit is this dress that
I have on it's really like a regular
short dress I don't like the arms
because the arms are like kind of like a
bit short and I don't personally feel
like the arms are tight enough to my
liking but it's so cute little throw on
dress I could film in this recording
this in just do what I do in this so
yeah this is
and that basically concludes at all it
was a little mini trial home or not so
hopefully I come back with more
tutorials
I mean tutorials what's wrong with you
hopefully I come back with more trial on
clothing hauls and I'm try different
companies I have a fashion overhaul
coming up I have pretty little things
stuff coming up with pretty little
things refused to send in my order and
I'm thinking I should make my next video
on the rant about that but anyways I'm
gonna do it like a boyfriend rates my
outfit type of thing so hope you guys
stay tuned for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
