description all the information on this
and my description box and I'm wearing
mink lashes from my lash line called
socialist anyways you can check that out
at WWII and these are the Styles era
that I'm wearing alright guys so I asked
you guys you guys wanted me to do a
little you know on the Q&amp;amp;A is something
my first Q&amp;amp;A and y'all said yeah yeah so
don't ask me some questions so I
actually got both on YouTube and I asked
you guys on snapchat so I'm gonna ask
snatch I would first and then I'm going
into the YouTube ones right
oh and if you guys are interested in
this tutorial um I will have in the
description box I was trying to do like
a soft loose curls look and this was the
outcome like it's a little sorry it's
alright now I'm gonna start with the
first question and this is from Queen
Coulee she said she asked me will I ever
prank Robert yes I have tried to prank
Robert actually but he'll ever believe
me like a phrase don't ever fall through
because he he don't ever believe mean it
won't ever go right until I have a real
good nice successful prank I can't
upload those ones that I'm doing cuz he
don't be believing me anyways what made
you start YouTube I started YouTube
because I don't know like I I used to
watch hair views on YouTube and that's
basically how I got to doing hair and
hair views and I was probably in like
the ninth grade when I was ordering
virgin hair for my first time not
letting up Aliexpress so I was looking
at a bunch of hair companies and stuff
like that so I actually went and ordered
some hair for my hair company and then I
tried to do like a little review this
was like in 2013 but I just always
wanted to be like I always wanted to be
like I feel like that's like the best
job ever like I'm sorry just go fucking
with me I feel like it's personally the
best job ever like you don't have to go
to work you can make money from home you
reach out to so many different people
and meet so much different people it's
just I like it's a great environment
like I like to make videos like I like
to record tutorials like I do like it
only part I don't like it's editing but
besides that speaking to you guys and
saying you got these questions and all
that good stuff like I really do enjoy
it so I like you too so I started
YouTube the reason why I started YouTube
was because it's something I've always
wanted to do I used to watch a hairstyle
called fabulous it's me like I said oh
my gosh she do here so pretty like all
these tutorials on my shit departments
and all that and I just I fell in love
with YouTube and how it is like I'm
telling you I can be on YouTube all day
long watching other I watch other people
I find ideas I just I'm really into
YouTube like I really am into you would
you ever start pranks and challenges oh
that kind of goes into the first
question will I have a prank Robert I
would do pranks and challenges it's just
Robert don't want to sit in front of the
camera like he wants it's like to like
continue on our channel and do really
good on our channel but he never wants
to sit in front of the camera like he
just wants to do false identity and I
can tell him like you need to sit in
front of the camera they need to see you
talk to you or not talk to you but you
talk to them and you know like that but
we will be doing pranks and challenges
starting soon be sure to subscribe to
our channel which is Rob and char Rob
with the 8i me Rob and with the thing
yeah then I hunt I love that Brazilian
straight wave wave from March 28th do
you know this is not a question this is
by the way I've been sold okay
all right
all right that's all the questions with
me one first everybody doesn't asking
about my hair and other things all right
so now I'm gonna go to my YouTube where
I actually got a question on the YouTube
post the first question is from Nalani
Roy yo and she said what is some advice
you'd give to someone wanting to start
their own YouTube honestly my advice is
like it's pretty much basic like if you
really want to do it and it's not just
for the money but you want to like reach
out to other people and help other
people then I think you should do it
like if you really feel like you can get
in front of a camera and talk to a
camera and people think it's weird on
the outside and it doesn't bother you
and you should do it even if you don't
have but hold on looking over there even
if you don't have an expensive camera
you can start off by using your laptop
your phone your iPad like all that stuff
like my first video is on my HP laptop
but that video is not private it's
embarrassing but I think one day I'll
probably publish it so you guys can see
where I started from to where I'm at now
so yeah I would just say if you really
want to do it and you feel like you can
do it and your personality is good and
you have a nice personality I'd go for
it how long have you been doing here and
do you travel so how long have you been
doing here so you travel to do classes
I'm she was me asking do I travel I've
been doing here for not even a year yet
on actual people though I started doing
my hair since I was in like tenth grade
I just have a girl who went to school
used to always do my hair and one day I
was going to a dinner party and that
girl was not answering my calls and she
knew damn well we had a 4:30 appointment
I said I'm going out tonight so I just
redid my hair I did it myself and I used
some new bundles did it myself and it
came up ever since then I've been doing
my own hair like I have for certain
events bonnet got my hair done but now
I'm at the point where I can do my own
hair really good so I do not get my hair
done by anybody else unless I eat my
back of my bob cut more or anything like
that yeah I've only been doing here for
less than a year I'll make a year in
August do you travel to do classes I
don't travel to do class
this and I haven't really gotten I've
gotten requested on doing classes but
not necessarily traveling but if I do
get a certain amount of requesters to do
travel classes I'll do like a little
hair tour but I already think I'm in
that category yet I'm gonna probably
wait until maybe like by next year I'll
probably be able to start doing things
like that it'd be like my skills would
be really up there to be telling people
what they not doing right and so cuz I
still make mistakes myself can you do a
video segment showing the difference
between a good lace front of the
family's front to show how the thin okay
this is not really a question and like I
can if I can do a video showing between
a good and a bad lace front I will but
that's what I have to come across a bad
lace front so because most companies I
used to work with would send me like
crap lace frontals and stuff and I'd be
like yeah I'm not reviewing this hair
like your hair is bad but lately I can't
go front tools like this front kind of
reminds me of my hairline frontal but
I'm not gonna lie I wanted to borrow
more but my hair not front so better but
yeah so I will see if I get a bad friend
so I had no issue with comparing a good
front saw what a bad front what is your
favorite abuse posture the lip gloss
it's not really a beauty supply store
lip gloss but NYX NYX I only sing NYX
that's it right next and why it's um
they always have abuse right so they
always have that big section with all
the lip glosses um my favorite one is
like strawberry parfait I like
strawberry parfait I like Eclair those
two are my lip glosses so yeah oh and um
peach cream pie something like that
those are my favorite when you use your
West they come along does the front to
stay down and also use the wax sticks
same brand as you but my fronts will
stay down for three to four days are
these I used tape and
um I don't know really understand what
she's asking me but when you slick your
hair down with the hair wax it's so I
will just as long as you tie your hair
down every night like it basically stays
down like you don't have to keep waxing
it every morning or nothing like that
like I waxed it earlier and I've already
went to the post office and back I'm
gonna tell my hair down tonight and
still be good so yeah where are you from
and how old are you I am from Miami a
lot of you guys know that everybody like
I have an accident but listen I do not
have no accent like you guys are hearing
stuff but I'm from Miami I was born in
Miami and I want to say when I was about
two years old me and my mom and my
brother we moved up to Pembroke Pines so
I was living in perma Pines but now I'm
back in Miami but yeah so I'm from Miami
Bass Florida basically Broward County
you know San Dakota even no Broward
County and Dade County is basically both
where I'm from and I am only 21 like
people one girl for my 21st birthday
somebody commented on my post it was
like oh I thought she was like 37 I'm
like bitch what like I'm sure the curse
but like I do not look 37 like when I
don't have my makeup on like I really
look like a kid but 37 like even with my
makeup done like I began Aidid on the
regular well I don't gotta eat no more
but that's because when I went Robert he
has such a full beard and all that they
obviously assume that I'm grown too
which I am but hey I'm 21
that's it what's your favorite glue to
use when it comes to front of there why
I like to use all right I like to use
ghost fun that's the first fool I
started off with and I like ghosts all
night
it's I can't really explain it but it
really makes the lace like it really
makes the legs disappear basically like
it really melts the glue and the
touching your scalp and your lace like
those three it like melted now you guys
can see from the
that I just did but I also like ultra
hold ultra hold those are two different
type of glues ghost bond is for people
with hair that's like sensitive skin if
you have sensitive skin and you break
out easily
ghost bone is for you because it's a
lighter product it's not as strong as
ultra hold also hold are for my girls
that dance my strippers if you work out
if you sweat a lot and you work out a
lot I recommend you getting ultra hold
because that glue is that's somewhere
right now it's just a tighter hold like
three layers of this and you're gonna
struggle to take this off like even in
like a month it's gonna like struggle
that's why I use ultra hold I use both
lose but I started using oh sure hold on
my clients and when they come to me for
their touch-ups I really be having to
sit there take my time to lift up that
glue because sometimes that glue does
not budge how did you start your website
oh that was so easy only part the only
hard part about the website is the
domain part but as you guys know there's
a bunch of places where you can start a
website on like wigs Big Cartel Spotify
all those places but I went I'm gonna
Wix it's not wait I'm sorry I have my
accounts with Big Cartel and you
basically I just designed it myself like
I do everything myself I create my own
logos I do all my things myself I am
gonna probably get an official logo made
but for now like I'm working with
everything that I've created myself so I
made it myself I put a little logo on
there you can use type poram type or oh
for a local making all that good stuff
it's super easy and then you go and buy
a domain so it doesn't say Big Cartel
and then the name of your shop it'll say
your shop calm basically do you have a
favorite drugstore foundation yes my
favorite drugstore foundation is the
Maybelline fit me foundation I'm in the
color
stop using it I don't remember its color
I mean I think I'm a cappuccino but
don't quote me but I'm in that color and
I like to get the matte one because my
skin is very oily and if I wear the
doing one this whole face would like
look like shiny like shine like I don't
baby oiled my whole face so yeah yeah I
have to get the matte one do you have
siblings a lot of people don't know that
I have siblings but I do have a brother
actually folks in today so we could yes
I have an older brother in Milton High
School in middle school and mixed ice
always like ah I'm gonna keep my brother
to come beat you I used to always use
that meanwhile he's like a thousand
miles away everybody can't come alright
Dean this is a lot of questions for one
person sheet this girl said how long do
you wear your wigs for um being that I
do hair reviews and I also do my own
hair I can really afford to like take
out my hair tomorrow and put something
else in but I try not to change my hair
that often but I am I probably change my
hair every week depending on what my
schedule is like cuz I have to put in
these reviews and stuff like that but I
usually like to keep it in for like a
week just to test out the hair make sure
nothing happens cuz bad hair doesn't
take a week like it doesn't take that
long to show that it's bad hair like
you'll know offer it if you had bad
period so yeah I don't know I'll keep my
hair for that long I probably keeping it
for a week sometimes a week and a
weekend the most I'll keep my hair and
in I'm sorry the most I keep my hair for
is not two weeks but sometimes I'd be
falling in love with these hairstyles
and I want to keep on but it's like I
have to move on because this is my job
so I have to change my hair but if I'm
doing if I'm real busy with hair and
doing people's hair I can't I can't like
do my hair as frequently so kind of
depending on my schedule and what I got
going on but usually every week or so I
change my hair what's my favorite fun my
favorite flower is the corner everybody
oh that's me but it's fine it's the corn
err nano silver fern it's at Sally's and
it's like seventy four dollars I know
it's a lot money but that's like you
won't replace a fire after that unless
you
breakdown like that's one of the best
friends I've ever had and it can press
out anything like if I ever decide to
press off some deep way impaired it's
gonna get bone straight like I cannot
wait to do that but I haven't done that
yet that's the final use where's your
family from what see rightness the slash
erase I'm Haitian non say like
but yeah I'm patient I'm Haitian girl
both my parents are Haitian I was born
here but I'm Haitian like my blood I'm
Haitian so yeah what tips do you have
for someone who wants to start that one
friend and doing here my tip for you is
before you start jacking anybody up
practice on yourself like get yourself
together before you start taking other
people money like make sure your product
is legit and make sure you know how to
do here and you know what you're doing
before you mess up anybody else so
practice on yourself practice on your
family and practice on your mom before
you take somebody else's money what
camera to use to film and we be having
other hair textures I use the canon ms e
OS and ten camera that's the camera i'm
using right now but i'm acting on up
during my camera and I'm gonna get one
of those t3i ones those things like
those big ones I'm gonna end up getting
one of those because it's time and I'm
just gonna keep this camera as my
vlogging camera and yes I'm gonna be
adding textures to my hair line I'm
gonna be adding 6:13 hair I'm gonna be
adding loose wave body waves and deep
curly but I'm not too sure on the body
wave yet because you know body wave once
that crabs milk wet in like the wave
pattern is basically gone and I know
girls trying to be like wedding and then
scrunch it and be like see the wave
pattern still here but to be honest that
would happen with straight hair as well
like the pattern is gone so yeah how did
you start your hair company and are you
hands on it with everything
I guess fancy I'm hands on what
everything I basically pay for
everything did everything myself set up
everything I ship I'm not all my orders
like I'm hands on with my business yeah
and how'd you started I just I've always
liked one in two so hair it's just I
feel like I didn't really have like a
following of people that would buy it
and stuff like that but when I started
doing here I started coming across all
these week as front tools and all these
shitty front tools I just have to go to
extra hole nine just to get you in front
of they look good so I said I'm gonna
sell my own hair
so people came back for me so your
install would look good and you won't be
worried about like oh I heard here look
good and yours came out like this
because that person might have had a
quality front so while yours are the
like really cheap in bad so yeah what
made you start doing here I wanted to
start doing it I told you guys already
this question and I'm gonna repeat it
how long have you been in a relationship
me and Robert are going on three years
we've been dating since I think I met
him tonight after grab a store April 26
