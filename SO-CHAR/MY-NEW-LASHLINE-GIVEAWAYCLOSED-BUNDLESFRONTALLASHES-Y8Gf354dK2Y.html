all right hi guys welcome back to my
alright so if you guys are interested in
my hair I will have the video link down
below on the tutorial for it alright so
today's video is going to be a giveaway
I'm doing a giveaway this is my first
giveaway ever I'm so excited
um I just see my channel growing and I'm
just so appreciated for it I'm almost at
40,000 so I just want to do a giveaway
to kind of give back and I'm also going
to be launching my new lash line this
giveaway as well so I came out with well
I came out I picked out three different
lashes that I want to sell to you guys
you guys always ask me what kind of
lashes are my wearing what sunglasses
anymore you always ask me what kind of
yours comment down below what kind of
lashes are you wearing but let's just of
those so I've decided you know what I'm
gonna come up with my own lash line you
guys always want to know and like yes
sure like my taste in lashes because I'm
not the type that likes to loop in
natural lashes I got this big eyes I got
these big-ass eyes so I personally like
my lashes to pop I feel like lashes are
my eyebrows and lashes are one of the
most important things in your makeup so
hey lashes on my favorite so I'm gonna
be showing you guys the styles I have
three different styles I'm gonna show
you each one one by one and I'm gonna
let you guys know my favorite my
favorite is the ones that I'm wearing of
course but they're gonna come in this
little plastic container just to keep
them safe through shipping but they're
gonna come like this I just picked the
the ones those ones these ones are gonna
be called
Lyra I picked the call these Lyra
because I'm kind of basing it off a
lyrical or and she's the type that likes
to wear more of a natural type of lash
with her makeup look she doesn't really
like eyeliner so I think these ones
would look really good with or without
liner eyeliner but mainly without
eyeliner so I'm gonna name these ones to
Lyra
and they're long in there with speed but
they're traumatic but they're natural
like they're not too much and these ones
are lira you guys know like my new
header and all that and my intro has
like this pretty little fur background
going but I ordered these and they were
supposed to fit on the box but I wasn't
too big so they're just a sticker so I'm
just gonna pack this with the packaging
and just have it as a sticker so these
ones are the Lyra ones these are the
ones that I'm wearing right now and
these ones I'm going to name char I'm my
name after me because they're so me and
these are like my favorite ones and
these are sharp
these ones are sure super pretty
I know off they look weird but one they
look like this like these ones I was
explaining it so in my previous video
but these I don't want to have those
gaps in them but in the gaps
it's like shorter hairs like they just
look so light I love them like these
ones char is the ones I have on right
now and they're so long in their store
for and it's so freaking and then these
ones I'm gonna knit I'm gonna need these
ones Chanel
well I'm naming these ones - no these
ones are cautioned I'll get a better
view these ones they're like full all
around and at the brita as you can see
at the beginning where your inner corner
goes they're shorter and then it gets
longer and then towards the inner corner
of your eye it gets the end of your eye
and gets shorter again and I'm gonna be
naming these Chanel because these are
just like uh these ones these ones I
feel like they're so like dramatic and
they're so pretty like they're so pretty
and dramatic I'm gonna name this no I
don't know why but they look expensive
like when you see this on your eyes
they're gonna look like full real mink
lashes on your eyes so these ones are
gonna be named Chanelle so these are the
three that I have the first one is the
ones called
Lyra and they're the most
natural-looking ones and then the second
ones are chard which are the ones I'm
going right now and then the third one
is going to be called
shanell which would be the dramatic ones
their dramatic so it's kind of like
they're determined it goes right here
it's kind of like is going from like
calm to dramatic but all glamour is
basically that's what I was actually
going for so I'm gonna give you I'm
gonna for my giveaway I'm gonna be
giving away one pair of these for free
so that would be included in my
giveaways so just to put some details
into this these lashes are reusable you
can wear I'm over and over again this is
actually my second time wearing these
ones and I'm probably gonna get a whole
bunch of wear out of them as long as you
treat them fine and um don't overdo the
hair glue on them make sure you clean
them up they'll be balm and you'll be
able to wear them over and over again
these aren't going to retail for ten
dollars ten US dollars and shipping will
be $5 for us and I know I have a lot of
supporters that are out in the UK and in
cannabic Canada Canada is and in Canada
so I will be shipping out worldwide and
for what is the con domestic yai
standard and it just I don't know but
out the countries worldwide so out the
country shipping will be $10 and us
because I live in the US will be five
dollars for shipping and shipping I'm
gonna make sure I'm on top of my
shipping so shipping will probably take
three to five days I'm gonna make sure
everything goes out as fast cuz I hate
when I order stuff and have to wait
forever or things but it might take a
little bit longer for people who live
out in out the country it's not as a
word but I can't think of the word
anyways out of the country I think it's
called domestic shipping but I cannot
remember but yeah so that's what it'll
be and they'll all come with a sticker
that says social ashes I'm so sad that
they couldn't fix the box but I'm gonna
get custom boxes made which will look
better so they won't come in this
wrapping and I don't know if I'll keep
the gold litter I'll probably try to
find a pink glitter cuz I'm going to
teen I'm just thinking like this is all
class in like the for a
background
then the glittery black and then the
gold but hey as long as it shimmers why
does it matter
so now as for the giveaway I know it's
fun but you clicked on the video it was
waiting for I'm going to be giving away
hair from not do love hair so I'm gonna
be giving out here from medulla hair
company I'm almost 100% sure you guys
have sure I'm damn I can't ever talk I
want to just ensure that you guys know
about this hair company this is not
doing the hair company and I'm going to
be giving away three bundles and the
frontal four three four three so I'm
gonna open it everything it's still in
the packaging this is Brazilian loose
waves so let me just see I'm taking it
off the packaging everything is still
packaged listen no doula hair it's lit
like it's just their frontal is from one
their frontals already come like pre
plugs so you don't have to do a lot of
plucking to them but they have actual
quality front so I always since I do
hair on a regular I come across a lot of
frontals so I'm now more familiar with
well good friends who looks like and
what a bad front to looks like and I'll
do this hair company has the front tools
that delays itself it's thin and it's
not really a harsh color this is easy to
blend into anybody Scout also look at
the hair like look at the hairline look
at that it's already pre plucked all you
really got to do is bleach the knots and
go over it again like and another way to
realize if you're friends with is good
the holes the little dots they're so
small they're so let me try to zoom in
because it's so okay there goes the dots
on there they're so small so it's gonna
blend with your like it's gonna plant
it's gonna melt into your scalp like now
the little got some good friends who is
like I'm not getting paid to say none of
this in fact they
send me this hair as extra hair and I
really could have made a wig with it or
sold it or you know did a bundle deal
but it's good hair so I'm gonna do a
giveaway I want to give back to you guys
like y'all really let y'all really
support me so I'm gonna give back your
hair and this is actually a good frontal
this sort of good front look like if
y'all want to know what about friends
who looks like I don't really like to
bash other companies but I don't as you
can as you can see like a hella
companies hit me up on a regular and
since I've previously bought here with
my own money from them I try not to I
know the experience that they've given
me and I present a lot even when they
send in here for free even words I'm
here I paid for it's still the same kind
of quality and to me it's not good like
and I don't do reviews on these
companies because I don't like to bash
other companies and mess up other
people's business so I'd rather not talk
about it on my channel at all so
probably have like one video on their
hair and as you can see that's it
anyways the bundles are 26 of 24 in a 22
I'm gonna only open up one bundle I
don't even open it up I'm gonna keep it
all fresh package there's still for you
guys but this is the hair and this is it
in its natural state as you can see it's
still tied if the 26 is pretty long
this is Brazilian hair I promise you
guys my doula hair is I see why they
have all these review these reviews with
other youtubers sites they really never
really do something like they really
have a good hair so I'm just gonna
package everything bag I only took out
the front tool out the packaging so I'm
gonna go ahead and close everything back
and yes so I will be giving out this box
of hair for free three bundles and a
frontal 22 26 and no 22 24 and 26 28
fronts whole you know I'm sayin I only
like my friends to be like long unless
I'm doing a bob I need a 20 inch that's
it if they had a 30 I need to get that
30 foot all you guys 20 so 20 inch front
so you know I'm saying
bundles all this for the free and a pair
of my lashes so basically I was going to
give away the snow shower lashes for
free cuz those are my favorites and the
ones I have on but I'll have my website
up by the time this video is up so I
guess I allowed you guys to pick which
pair you guys want so now I'm gonna tell
you guys how to enter the giveaway
that's to be a supporter whoever
supports me I support them like I'm
definitely giving back this is my first
giveaway and it definitely won't be my
last
like I'm not able to start giving away
wigs already made like you know I'm
saying brand new weights already made
give our lashes I give up I'll give away
I have a lot of things I could buy and
give away like I'm really a given person
so I've just decided like now's the time
like my channel is growing so much and
it's gone so fast and I have so much new
supporters and so many people who write
me and somebody love this they love that
like you guys really just basically gave
me the battery to keep going to keep
pushing and to just give out more and
give back so you guys get to pick out a
pair lashes and you guys will get a free
