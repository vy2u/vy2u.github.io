today I'm going to be basically
revamping my ball that uh this is hair
from what kiss hair and I'm wearing 6:13
hair it was one b613 I'm wearing two
bundles I had two got three bundles but
only ended up using two I'm wearing
twelve to twelve inches and a 12 inch
frontal and once again this hair was one
piece that 613 and I turned it to this
raging red color like I don't remember
okay I don't remember which colors I
used but I did use three different boxes
of a door and I kind of mix them all
together that's how I got this bright
baking bread I will show you I will have
them insert a video right here of me
coloring the front tool and I bleach
just to be clear the frontal was 1b so
those black roots and then 6:13 blonde I
did leash the roots to a lighter color I
don't have that on camera I'm sorry but
I just used some developer and on bw2
bleaching powder and I left it on for
Mike it started bleaching fast so I'm
gonna say I left it on for like 20
minutes or so and I got it to a lightish
brown color and then I put the red on
top of it so you basically see what the
color looked like excuse me
you'll see what the color looked like
before I started to put the red over it
umm how y'all feelin my makeup I have
some big announcements coming up I'm
going to be starting my own fashion line
you guys always ask me where do I get my
lashes from what kind of lashes are
these so I'm like you know what it's
time to get your shop and asked me for
so I will be coming out with a lash line
this is a pair of the lashes right now I
know y'all gonna ask me about them so
I'm gonna be naming these char
which is my name and I'm gonna name
these my char because these good are
like my favorite ones I love them
and I mean I guess I named it after me
because it's my favorite ones and these
are the type of blushes I go for they're
like wispy and then they have like the
little cut I can't explain it not like
little cuts but you know it kind of go
short long short long so that's just my
those are my type of lash I don't really
like thin lashes let's just are so
important and they bring your eyes out
and those thin ones they make me look
cross-eyed like these are my old videos
I had the Walmart ones on and I'm like I
love them but they're too thin for these
big eyes so yeah I have them on my
website link down below and everything
and I'm also going to be doing a
giveaway so stay tuned for that I'll
probably have a link in the video down
below or in the video down below I have
it in the description box to go I also
have all the details on this hair in the
description box below so we're gonna go
ahead and just get started all right
this is my comb I just burnt it
yesterday so I broke it off instead of
throwing the whole cone away I need to
comb this out I have it I didn't like I
tried to wrap it when I'm gonna sweep
but that crap now I'm working me because
I'm a rough sleepers so when I woke up
the Bonnie was definitely off I didn't
do any baby hairs on this because I
don't like color hair to have baby hairs
and plus the hair is coming a lot to the
front so I don't think a baby hairs
would really look cute with this I
didn't really poke it that much either I
plucked it a little bit but I didn't do
too much because I want the hair to fall
down in my face like this anywho so
nothing to be showing alright so first
thing I'm gonna do is a lot of people
ask me what kind of platter and I use
and I use this one and I got it at
Marshall's this one only goes up to oh
it goes up to 450 but yeah it's really
small so you can get into small places
so I usually take my hair parted in
little sections but
when you want to go and stuff like that
you already got time to be doing all
that but I'm gonna take this part in
chunks the parts that I really need to
cut off in sections is the back because
the back is like forgetting so I'm gonna
flower on this a little bit and then I'm
gonna go ahead and put some oil in it so
fly under more because it's a little dry
right now
6:13 here is very very like nice plant
like I don't want to say it's dry but
6:13 here to me is personally it was
black hair and they just put a lot of
chemicals in it and did a lot of stuff
to get us a beach that whitish blonde
color so it definitely is processed here
just think about how to got it to be
this light color but yeah it's not that
hard it's not that much to do oh my god
guys I'm gonna be rocking some three in
here soon I cannot wait to do this
review on that 30 inch here so meanwhile
what I'm doing this I might as well just
answer some questions that I get asked
on a daily I get asked on the daily
what's the name of the wax stick that I
use on a regular is the carrot hair care
I use the Cara care wax stick and you
can purchase it on Amazon or you can
purchase it at your local beauty supply
store depending on how your business or
run still not all the few specialists
have it but I know I got mine at the
beach my store
I don't know no new I love my Qi Susan
so I'm gonna go ahead and put some I
cheat on my hair I love love love my
cheese chee-chee-chee
I'm gonna run through here I frequently
get a lot of questions asking me like I
get a lot of emails asking like
do you have any more weights on hand
tell me more weights for sale like
things like that I don't have any wigs
on hand for sale and when I do have them
I put them on my page so basically when
I receive hair from a company I review
the hair I make a wig I color it i style
it I do what I do to it I make a wig I
make the video I make the tutorial or
whatever it is
after that I take the weight off I take
the wig off and I put it off yourself
and once I put it up for sale
it's first-come first-serve I can't do
no holes who ever pay the first gets it
first
it's how I basically put it so I don't
have any waves
hanging around the house why the ways I
do have hanging around the house I'm
guaranteed that you guys don't I'm sure
that you don't want those waves because
those are wigs I was making when I first
started making wigs and that's before I
even knew how to really make wigs so
those wigs I would never sell to anybody
because they're basically like practice
wigs
anyways so therefore know for all those
emails that I get asking me if I have
wigs to sell I don't when I post up a
wig so and I'm selling away sometimes I
sell two at a time sometimes I saw one
at a time I honestly suggest that you
just hop on it cuz that's the only way I
have available so I think I'm flying it
now - my desire of how I like it
and now I'm gonna be taking I like this
oh when I put this right hand I've never
had like ready hair this right like this
so at first I was like definitely like
if you about it but not it is gone and
stuff but it's more Bob so I really
really like it like at first I was like
oh I look like under he recognized me
put this little jumpsuit and I have on a
fashion of a jumpsuit I have a try on
haul on it so this jumpsuit is from
fashion / tell you before your ex
you got the hot come on deck getting

doing cuz I feel like I was doing so
much farther but it just kept one my
most viewed video was a video I posted
