let's go below myself I'm spilling on
myself I'm finna MA filling myself I'm
feeling myself but no marvel amar below
myself I'm spilling on myself
hopefully MA but let myself I'm still on
my cell hi guys welcome back to my
channel so today I'm gonna be doing the
so called silly sponge so first off let
me give you guys a quick it's some quick
info
this is the real I purchased this from
Molly cosmetics online it was about nine
dollars or whatnot I want to let you
guys know that I probably ordered this
in this summer and I didn't get it to
February like late February 20th so this
actually came from China from the
original surcingles starting off but I'm
not gonna lie shipping it to bitch you
might want to think twice and maybe get
one from the store but this is it and
yeah
Bungie or whatever and this is an areal
beauty blender as well
this retails for about twenty dollars
and you can get it at Sephora that's
where I got mine I don't think they sell
my Ulta so this is a real beauty blender
and this is the brill silicone spent $19
$20 so I'm kind of gonna do it on like a
separate side of the face I have like my
eye shadow my brows and all that done
already so I'm gonna go ahead and do my
foundation last thing that I'm gonna
come back
the camera in blend it out with each
side okay so I'm back so I just have dr.
foundation on my face right now and if
you guys were wondering one foundation
I'm using I'm using the Maybelline
mass Parvez fit me foundation this one
and I mixed the colors
3:55 which is coconut and 340 which is
cappuccino
I got a miss those two get to get my
tongue in there freaking hair it's
always a string that eternally all these
straight in here alright more I start
blending I'm gonna spray my face down
with this this is the Mario Badescu Oh
skincare facial spray with a blurbs in
rose water I'm sure a lot guys have
heard about it it is only about six
dollars at your local oh all right
so I'm gonna spray down and just even
whit alright so I'm gonna start off with
look foundation is really in my hair
like really okay why did I do that okay
so I'm gonna start off with the sponge
I'm not sure I didn't really watch
videos on how it's done but I'm just
gonna delete towel I think you should be
done which is just
honestly hair is gonna dress me oh sorry
y'all with this part of all this won't
lay down so I'm gonna hold it in the
meantime I feel like you can just blow
it I know I didn't cut off my bro I'm
going to do great should you bring that
thing down babe this is what it looks
like that's what it looks like right now
you really wondering about this little
circle right here I got these two white
dots that are lying on my face so I
named miss a spot
all right so that's what it looks like
with this much I mean with the silver
sponge now I'm gonna go ahead and do
this side with my damp Beauty Blender
this is usually what I use on my face so
that's why I'm just gonna wave faster
and it's just come I did have my nose
hello and just go up here with the baby
but I can't reach it with this
this is what this side looks like it's
hard to reach on certain spots so I have
to slide it in this is what my suppose
this is what the Beautyblender side
looks like from the looks of it to me I
personally feel like I like this side
that much I feel like the foundation is
just sitting on the face like on this
side it's more blended in and more into
the skin then on this side I feel like
it's literally just sitting on here and
it looks so very cakey to me so yeah I'm
going to go in with my la girls
concealer in the color cool tan no
I don't know about shale but it's like
impossible for me to do like one
straight line first thing I'm gonna use
this to respond I'm gonna go ahead and
get my chi minh on this question you
guys comment down below but do you guys
ever put concealer are there needs your
eyes and it starts to get like a little
tingling burning buildings this happens
to me all the time but not care for my
other girl so that's the side
I think I need a little bit more
concealer on this one I'm gonna put one
side so now for the tip of the nose just
come on - hurry and the thing about it
is the issue is like it'll put it's good
to it for blind you don't know that but
they don't sink in the skin so just to
be on the safe side I'm just gonna go
with my baby butter in kind of try to
tap that edge you need a blink down
split down here look at my cards fuzzy
one of it so I'm just gonna go with some
foundation and clean that up because I
can't just put my foundation
so this is what the concealer on these
Silla sponge and this is with the V
blender
I'll take road like a mad that people
really been hyping this thing up like
this like come oh it's a use programs
like dishes soaks when I bake I like to
mix my banana powder I like to mix that
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
I'm sure like a lot of you guys about
powder so I mix those two together so
clearly I'm not gonna use this button
you just pick it up but this is probably
gonna I thought it was gonna make slide
right off I'll get that
throwing your Beautyblender wait for
what
not this definitely I'm gonna go ahead
and dust off the powder with my bare
minerals face foundation powder in the
color hazelnut 25 good really quick I'm
just going to do a little contouring
with the true complexions contour
palette with some Laura Mercier I'm just
going to clean that up I'm going to go
ahead just use my Beauty Blender on both
sides
yeah so this is the this is the this is
the
look at the coins war on this side so
yeah that is my experience this is what
it looks like after I done this is what
it looks like after I don't you think
only good thing about this so I guess
it's like so pretty easy to just wipe
off you can use wipe it off with a
makeup wipe or some waters what the
couplet you computed by there you just
got to do a lot but right now it looks
brand-new again because I just like to
know what a piece of masking with
nothing on it so this is what its back
to look in and of course you know the
Beauty Blender is that I wash it with
some soap and and squeeze it squeeze it
it's a lot more work for sure I'm going
to say that this is a no-go for me I
don't think I'll ever be using this
again matter of fact if you want
incumbent down below and I'll email this
to you because this was a waste of my
nine dollars and I waited like three
months for nothing
this is crap sucks the Beauty Blender is
not going nowhere that's when you know
this ever and this is why it needs to
invest your money and I already spent
$20.00 I'm sucking that I'm gonna do
good for me and that's me a while didn't
spend nine dollars on something that's
not even gonna work I've seen a lot of
people when talking about how good this
is
and I think no not for me
all right there my Beauty Blender over
anything so results don't lie and I
definitely say this time looks with at
the next side so hey this is my personal
opinion some other people might think
this works best for them I mean it's my
video anyway so yeah comment down below
