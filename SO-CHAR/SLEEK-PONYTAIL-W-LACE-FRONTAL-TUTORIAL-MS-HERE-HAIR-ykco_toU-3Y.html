my channel so today I'm going to be
showing you guys how to put your hair in
a ponytail with a lace part oh oh
so with me love is part my ear because
reported cuz I wanted to be like a
lotus-eyed part like I wanted to come
down with this get me so now that I have
it pointed to my liking
I'm going to put some of this on which
is just some biosilk leave a message
so I'm just going to cook this part and
just leave a little bit of hair out
pinched LP similes you probably get this
much out
great I kind of want it going and you
see my track so I feel like I can see
them they might have the realistic I
kind of want it going over right here or
should I put it which way you guys feel
good I kind of let the faces all right
you see this part right here so you know
you just take this coin can tune with
pieces into the back
this hairstyle is pretty pretty simple
but I know the first time I tried to do
it it cannot come on bravely oops
take some we're at 50 near to get it
also I have not planned my hair so the
way like I've already point out on the
context some pieces of the hotel
press it with my country flowers
so if you guys are wondering this is
hair from their hair company and I'm
wearing related industry honestly that
vital so stuff Oh like I do recommend
them familiar like it's really really
nice when you need a little not here
near but this is not a Kincaid only but
I think it is pretty pretty nice
something I would say is that though the
frontal part like my middle part of the
frontal is kind of balding like losing
hair and I wanted something maybe eyes
in it because I know this has been
another trend with mine but I will be
held could have happen because like like
I said I'll be wearing this here in an
hour and plus I don't need like my nose
itchy I want to pitch I probably pads or
something but I like it the actual
Frenchman Confucius an actual frontal
the hair on that's on the West we like
 off and we'll get followed so I'm
not really sure why I'm not sure why but
that is them is happening to
destructible so now next step is going
to be to lay these layers so with my
girl it's not I'm just gonna create some
edges baby
long nice about this piece right here or
focus piece into this endless comparing
to do that for
all right obviously think I need to go
back and like reflect this one because
it's when you got love yeah it's a lot
of years and for me to like this just
too much can't go to this one here and
then after this I I'm going to just kind
of let it hang
I wish I just love looking for
keep like that this lonely that one once
I got fiber in the neck so initially
this is poking out your fingers like
this is not to be taken out this girl is
not as crispy enhance boom this is like
the most easiest way you can get style a
tomorrow night if you're in a rush to go
school if you're going to organize you
just do a little sequence of this it
back up
classy books and yeah so guys I hope you
guys enjoyed the dictatorial on how I
keep my sleek ponytail little is trouble

want
