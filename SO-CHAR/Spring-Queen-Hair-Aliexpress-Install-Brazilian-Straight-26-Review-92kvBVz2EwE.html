this is actually an installed slash I
don't know first impressions on this
here and I did tell you guys that I was
gonna also upload a video of me trying
to bleach the hair but it didn't really
come out to the color that I wanted it
to so and a big chunk of the video got
cut off so I didn't finish the video or
created so I'm not sure like I'm still
iffy about it I'll probably create it
and see how it looks and if it looks
good I posted but this is Aliexpress
Spring Queen hair and this is Brazilian
Street and it's in a 28 or 20 22 24 and
26 and so far what can I say I would say
that it it's really really soft and
lightweight like I did it myself
like I just you know perched on my hair
down I thought might be foul and put on
the cap and then glued it onto the cap
just like that
I used all of my 2624 and this is like
all of the 22 that I have left like yeah
so what I would say is that like this
hair is really good like it doesn't shed
that much like it barely even shows like
I can run my hands through it and I can
always run dirt free bu like you know
you never know what straight hair like
sometimes somebody to come through and
try to run their hands to your hair and
then I get caught just a little tangled
but like it always goes through
perfectly fine and I did kind of like
bleach it a bit and I know inside
doesn't really catch the lighting but
I'll kind of like insert a picture of
how it look outside like that but um
beyond that I would say that this hair
is pretty good I found it so far I've
only found it twice
I actually was today today Sunday I
installed it Friday so I'm gonna had it
in for like at least two days or three
days though today and I didn't do
nothing to it yesterday I actually left
it wrapped up and I didn't flatter
nothing so this is my second side
flattering it yeah it comes down to like
a right here
and I think I'm like 5/5 I'd say so
that's like how long the 26 times down
it's really nice I flat ironed it and
burned it with this just to give you
like that pretty chic shine even though
it is naturally shiny on its own and I
thought I earned it and pressed it down
with this brush like basically I do this
but like in little chunks and I just
when I believe it didn't get frizzy or
crunchy I did leave it in like I have
this thing where like when I bleach my
hair and I want it to like come back saw
of course I used silicone I'm up
anybody's ever heard of it but you can
get it at like your local food supply
store so I used silicone
and I kind of get like a trade
time I don't know trade Bucky but like a
like a little like a disposable food
thingy that can make macaroni lasagna
and I'll fill it up with water and ice
and then up boys the hair with a
conditioner and then I just put it in
there and I just let it so um actually
insert a picture and show you what it
looks like in depth
okay so now that you've seen the picture
you kind of have like a better idea of
what it looks like and I just leave it
in there for like 30 minutes or so then
I washed out and the ends won't be like
you know when you bleach your hair the
ends be all fried and sometimes but
besides that I think basically if you
get good hair or normal decent hair the
best way to maintain it and have it look
good is to actually treat it like it's
your own hair and actually use good
products on it and wrap it up at night
you know everybody sometimes be like not
everybody but a lot of you look like oh
their hair company was horrible I left
here and a hair net not take it out and
it's all frizzy and kinked up they look
at the knots and it's like what I mean
you need to brush your hair like I'm
sure when you have your hair out like
and you're laying down and you get back
up it gets all you know kind of like
matiush is just like some freaking
headphones when you put your headphones
in your pocket taking yourself they like
knotted so like you have to comb this
hair brush it just treat it like it's
your real hair and you won't have any
issues I would say that I give this hair
like out of a tin I'd probably give this
hair a 9 or an 8 because it has I have
like no issues with it and I even cut my
lips and it barely sheds the color came
out it did come on as light as I wanted
to but it came up still nice
I guess maybe I'll try to like curl it
next week or something because like just
like a long curl look but besides that
so far within this three days of course
the hair is oh and I love it and like I
literally can't stop like running my
hands through it this is like some
like when you see it you just want to
touch it because it looks so silky
nicely I was in a model of the day like
walking
I paid by 500 for this but I really did
but it looks like it so yeah but um so
maybe I'll do like a to meet update make
maybe father and show you guys take a
look father because this is just like
kind of like a first time I'm like not
even that long only like three days of
course it'll probably get damn I'm not
but tougher maybe and this is what all
the hair looks like on my really me
yeah so I'm definitely filling his hair
and I love me substrate here like I've
always got your hearing maybe I think my
next care of you I'll probably get some
think wait there's what I'm gonna do but
for right now I'm gonna rock this curly
hair for a little bit give it a couple
weeks to see how it holds up and let you
guys know I'll probably even like try to
bleach it some more and then turn in
like a different color that maybe
burgundy or Purple's I've been wanting
to try purple I've done burqini before
but yeah okay guys so oh and also I
wanted to let you guys know I do have
some upcoming videos coming up I have an
eBay final video coming up and I've seen
