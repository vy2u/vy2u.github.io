jungle show me to a monster that jungle
made me go hard that structure hi guys
welcome back to my channel so today I'm
going to be doing a n star review on
this hair that I'm wearing and this is a
lace front tool which is in an 18 inch
and this is Malaysian straight so it's
Malaysian straight and it's 18 inch
front so a 22 or 24 and 26 yes 20 to 24
in the t6 um for right now I think I was
able to fit 22 22 26 to 24 in a little
bit of the 22 inch bundle and this hair
this hair is from a VIP Beauty um this
is one of the I've done work of this
company before multiple
okay this hair is from VIP beauty hair
this is a Malaysian straight that I'm
wearing and so far I've won this wig in
and out last week I started wearing to
snow Conway but so far I can honestly
say that the hair is nice I did not go
wash it I just ended up many into it
wait I didn't call wash it I just
basically bleached my not shut the
frontal and that was really it I didn't
and I wore the only thing I basically
washed instant frontal that's all so far
I would say that the hair does not shed
I don't really have any issues with it
it it's pretty good it doesn't shed I
don't have any issues with this besides
nothing it's strong and it's really
slowly I really I think I probably flour
into twice just to give it like a
straight look you know with like
sometimes if you leave it down or like
leave it sitting around stuff like that
I might do a wave pattern or something
so I just pressed out basically to get
it this way I don't want to use any oils
on it it actually has its own luster and
shine to it in that's really regular
light but here the ends are pretty
pretty nice they are they don't press or
anything like that I like that they're
not too big an end so it looks like a
long natural Indian lace wig basically
black silicon Rocky
with the shipping on the air the company
reached out to me probably on like a
Sunday and we probably finished business
all in one by Monday and I probably
received the hair I want to say like
Thursday their shipping is very
fastening our very long point with their
shipping so I would definitely recommend
this hair it's really really soft it's
not going to be injections no tangles or
anything like that I can literally make
down you get out of my bed and just run
my fingers through it in to start my day
so I won't be wearing this way for the
next couple of days just to get a better
feel for it so I was saying about two
weeks I'll be back with an update to cut
let you guys know how the hair is
holding up I'm not going to put any
curls into it because it is very long
and it is very hard to curl long hair
and I won't be coloring it I think I'm
just going to leave it as my everyday
have black wig I don't plan on doing
anything to it but leaving it how it is
maybe washing it within a ten weeks or
so and that's it I'm gonna be bleaching
it or anything
dyeing it's nothing I'm just going to
keep it the way it is so also if you
guys are interested in this makeup look
that I'm wearing right now I do have a
video I will list it down below so you
guys can see it and let me know what you
think okay and so that's all for today
thank you guys for watching to all my
new subscribers thank you guys for
subscribing into my own subscribers
thank you guys for holdin it down and
that's all for today bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
