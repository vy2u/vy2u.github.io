hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm doing a video on some care
that I received and this is from VIP
beauty hair on Aliexpress so I'm gonna
show you the hair this is kind of like
my unboxing or initial people ok so I
received a 2624 and and 22 and the
Front's who is actually in the front so
is an 80-inch so the front came in a
little plastic baggie and it's also
wrapped in this hair man so this isn't
my first time ordering here from VIP
here I do have that water wave hair I
think it's like proving water wave and I
also place the ends like you know I've
been wrong curling it I actually have
that one in that's from VI V so this is
the frontal
see what it looks
so as you can see the lace is tinted and
I wouldn't say the hairline is very cat
it does have some baby hairs I wouldn't
say that the hairline is ready to pick
it kind of looks a little freak luck but
I'm still gonna go over it and pluck it
and I've actually watched some new
videos on how to recover eyes in front
of them so this whole thing I watched I
think my issues be I don't leave my
bleach on long enough to actually bleach
all of the knots so I'm gonna actually
leave it on way longer and I'm gonna try
and tint the laces and see how that goes
so this is the bottom and this is also
deep wave hair I'm not sure which if
it's Brazilian but I'll definitely have
a link down below on for this Brazilian
but it is deep curly hair in it so here
let me try to I haven't run my hair for
anything so I'm just gonna try to so I'm
running my hands through it and it's
kind of nodding but nothing too major
this is it kind of ran through
barely even fully brand throughput
again are you just separating and
partying
oh go there with the moon football in
right now so this is my 18 inch front
side
Dean so I'm gonna start from my bundles
from 26 and up 26 is my longest run this
right here is a b-26 inch so I'm gonna
just run my fingers through it three
times and break it apart and I see this
is like some deep curly hair like super
pretty and it smells like it smells like
out of hair but like nothing too major
like nothing to like stink or nothing so
I know when you first receive the
bundles you'll probably be thinking like
damn I should have ordered four bundles
or something like that but once you get
your fingers through the curls and you
open up the tracks like the hair really
does start to open up it is like
knotting up but this I think is just the
thickness of the hair but I'm shedding
as for shedding
this is most of the hair that you know
it's not that much hair so this is my 20
tickets like some kinky ask oh yeah this
is my 26 I'm gonna put my to me or next
to the 26 so you can kind of understand
what I mean when I say like you'll think
some fun to run enough but after a while
it open so basically this is what I mean
like this is the 26 and this is the 26
close and this is the 24 and I mean oh
this is the 26 but this is a 26 comb
through and teased out this is the 24 as
you can see it appears really small but
once you run your fingers through it it
smells the same once you run your
fingers through it and just start
playing with it teasing it out it rolls
I'm pretty sure it'll probably even get
bigger than the actual 20
I am gonna be conditioning and receive
where it goes
like I do everything I can to keep my
hair like bomb and nice so basically
there shouldn't really be no excuse to
why your hair can't maintain because I'd
like to do the utmost to my hair like I
might treat my hair like that really
like is my real hair so if your weave is
bugging it's not me
so yeah we'll see with this hair gonna
deep condition it because it is curly
hair and curly hair is something that is
hard to maintain so this is my 24 inch
curls plucked out and pulled out
it's really pretty the girlfriend is
pretty great so this is the last bundle
which is my 22 confirm that I'm just
gonna do the same thing just from your
pants do it
get up in there curls
right because
stubborn oh this is the most shitty that
I come
look how big it is
thank curly hair come through
like this thing can cover my whole head
and I got like a big head so I haven't
had no pretty hair like just like I've
only got curly hair like this one time
and it was hell it was from the modern
hair show and I wanted to kill myself
okay I almost broke my wrist
call me that out so
yeah hopefully this is bomb and it does
not do that to me but I will be deep
conditioning it I'm gonna deep condition
it with silicone mix and I'm going to
shampoo it I'm going to deep
conditioning with silicone mix and I
like to get those little packets of
cream of nature those things like cream
of the cream of nature conditioners boy
are you guys smell good and it's having
a super soft so I'm going to put it in a
little tray and I'll put the conditioner
and leave it in I'm gonna wash it then
I'm gonna condition and leave it
conditioned and put some ice in it and
let it put it in freezer and let it cool
and I'm going to overnight it and when I
wash it off in the morning there would
not be one not no not not but like if
it'll go through like butter
I don't think I'll make it we got it so
we'll see and that's all for today guys
