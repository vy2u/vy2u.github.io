today I'm gonna basically be show you
guys kind of similar to last video I
uploaded but another video on how I put
install my lease
well lace wigs but my lace front wigs so
basically I'm going to show you guys
step-by-step on how to get your hair to
look natural and beautiful like this so
if you guys are interested in this video
keep on watching
no please guys I need you guys to bear
with me because I broke my ring light
last night trying to film for you guys
so my coloring looks off so far I just
had one like my eye shadow in my
eyelashes I did into my foundation in
that protein yet because I cannot have
that on my hairline before I glue down
my lace so I kind of still don't have my
mirror I left it at home so I'm going to
be using the same method I did last time
but I have it stacked up on a box so
this time when I apply the lace you guys
will be able to watch the whole
application this is some curly hair from
Ali Julia it's a 360 wig you might see
some white things in it and that's
because of the little stone of the cap
that I used when I sewed through but
this is the wig um this is three bundles
I was able to fit all three but knows
this is three bundles of 26 and a 20
inch front tool so you can kind of see
the different lengths but I'm pretty
sure once it's on and I fix it you won't
be able to see that and the lace hasn't
been cut yet I haven't really even much
plugged it that much and I'm going to go
ahead and try the wig on cut him on my
ears and do some plucking
he's like I made this week a bit smaller
than I usually do
but if it's this one so yeah this is
what it all looks like a damn miss so I
have to even out the way I feel my ear
tabs right now I know I'm not gonna have
to do too much cutting so I'm gonna just
cut around the tab a little bit because
they are actually on my ears pretty nice
I'm gonna have to cut this side at all
but this is to get cut a little bit okay
so first thing I'm gonna do is my my
middle part so I have the way even here
this is what the hair looks like it's
parted in the middle oh my god it looks
like a complete wig like this looks like
oh wait you know I don't think my part
is going straight I think it's going to
cement it but either way I just want to
have a better understanding so when I
placed my hair down so now that it looks
like this I'm gonna take my hot dog and
it's already hot and I'm going to just
lay down the part I'm going to do now is
I'm gonna just take my tweezers and I'm
just gonna slightly look be nice so it
is hard to do this on camera but I'm
gonna try to do it as best as I can
cuz lighting in here is terrible
basically you just want to plug it to
your likings and don't
it's not good to like not look enough
and it's not good to overclock so I kind
of just go with the flow and everybody
makes mistakes so sometimes I may over
talk my frontals but sometimes I always
get it right I usually get it right so
that's what I'm doing right now the
hairline was already like pre plucked so
it's not really a harsh hairline which
is
frickin amazing but okay my hairline is
pretty decent just for the hairline it
still needs to be plucked more but yeah
this is what it looks like okay okay so
I decided to get it up close and
personal for you guys and basically just
show you guys the plucky routine that I
do as you can see the hairline right
here is very fine so I just go behind it
because if you over plug the top
hairline you'll basically be pulling out
the hairline so it'll just be bald right
at this point so it's already fine here
but as you can see it's like getting
thicker so I just go inside that part
and pluck that out and maybe sometimes
I'll pass by and take some out in the
front just to thin it out some more but
this is basically the routine that I do
when I'm plucking and I'm gonna keep
going around and basically getting into
the hair it's like I always switch
around when I'm plucking and now I'm
going to sometimes you'll find a knot at
the end bleach sometimes it's a couple
of them but sometimes there's some that
you can just like pluck out and be okay
and now we're getting to the corner of
the hair and I'm just going to take it
and continue on waiting as you can see
is not really that heavy here so I
really always go lightly on the corners
because when some companies make these
frontals they go very light go to the
corners and now I'm going to turn it
over to the last corner and this side is
like very very lightly um light hairline
so I'm not gonna over pluck that side
and basically that's how you get it this
is the side that I did off camera
sometimes you guys don't have to do this
but I always tend to do it I just like
to take like a little lipstick or that
the liner and I'm gonna dot off the
parts that have like go in if I can make
sure that I'd like to come out to match
the hairline like right here it goes
again it comes out right here a little
bit it goes in right there again so kind
of like make sure that I'll do a dip
around there right here is fine it's
just right here and it's a dip right
here and it'll cause that call right
here noticing right there all right so
I'm gonna take it off you see how this
part is just sticking straight up I'm
gonna lay it all down with my Hong Kong
once the hair is glued at once I can do
a little bit now yes
no one let me cut up on my lace some
more no when you keep putting a wig I
have a hole in my cap when I look down
I'm still in that camera screen so now
yo I look like I think I think I could
pull off a bald link be room I'm stupid
alright so now I'm going to be taking my
lace glue I mentioned in my previous
video that this lace glue is in a clear
bottle but I use Walker lace tape ultra
hold that is the lace tool that I'm
using and that's the one that I use
please don't people get upset and they
say it's so fine maybe this is your
first time seeing me so I will tell you
this is the Walker lace tape glue that
I'm using I said it in my previous video
you probably didn't see it so I'm gonna
say it again but I just don't want to be
a habit of repeating the same thing over
and over again in every video so what I
say now is um if you guys are interested
in certain things that I've used you can
go to my previous videos cuz that's
where I fully went in detail about the
product okay so now I'm going to be
taking my leave booth and I got me a
fresh one so I don't have to shake or
break my arm to get it out and I'm gonna
just do one round right here and when I
do that I'm going to just lay down my
hair and lay down the cap alright and
I'm just gonna just do that hold on
I'm doing that one layer across my
forehead no now I'm doing my side Oh
remember how I said I put that glue
there cuz it goes in right here but
there's a dip right here so I got the
dip
all right and then got the tip she did
know I went back in and now I'm coming
back out and then I just take my bottle
and I get to the corner because it's
kind of hard to reach with this stick
and I basically just put the glue down
made the glue down and put it down it
also time to take my steak and do that
to it and then I'm gonna do the same
routine for this side so as you can see
right here it's not a it's a dip right
here ah so I'll just put some glue right
here let me smudge it and then it comes
out right here come out and then I go
back in
and then I put the last layer right here
it comes up right there and then I'm
just gonna squeeze think and get my side
oh okay so that was basically the first
round and after that I'm gonna do my
second round and then I'm going to clean
off mothers are so dry I'm going to
clean off the red dots so I'll be back
when it's been tried my camera is not
focusing okay so I'll be back when it's
tried and then I'll do my well I'm gonna
do my second coat off-camera it's the
same thing just second coat and then
I'll come back when both coats right dry
okay
the glue is now dry and one way to find
out that the glue is dry probably let it
both sit cold to sit on for about 10 to
15 minutes time you know when it's fully
dry is when you go like this
and it doesn't really pull back in this
state so I got a clip and I'm just gonna
clip this part back and I'm gonna clip
this part back so I can't glue down the
front part first I mean the left the
right side first
whatever freakin side is superior on
your side is what I'm gonna go down
first so I'm gonna pull the lace forward
pulling it forward and I'm going to can
you guys see I'm gonna lay the glue
right here on the lace and yo this thing
melted in like perfectly you literally
cannot see anything so now I'm gonna
take it and I'm gonna do this side and
then I'm gonna pull it forward and I'm
just gonna keep pressing it with my
finger so I've done this side now I'm
doing the little dip that we had not
dead put the outcoming side
and then I'm going oh man Oh something
like wrong hold on okay
all right so now that I've did this part
um I'm gonna go ahead and cut off my ear
tab from right here because when it is
glued on it is definitely now I'm going
to be taking this side okay I'm gonna
just follow the same steps I took the
other side and just be pressing it down
with my fingers following that same
routine up until I get to the corner
which is right here and then I just like
to take my fingers in and rub them in
I'm gonna do I'm gonna start to create
my baby hairs and pluck my hair some
more and make it look as pretty and
realistic as it can be okay so I'm just
gonna start trying to find my baby hairs
and where I want them and I like the
line like you right here so here right
here but first I'm going to plug it I'm
gonna pluck the section out some
and then I'm going to cook out here just
you suck click and then I'm going to
pluck out some of the baby hairs you
just don't want your baby gets too full
don't look really natural I think this
is kind of enough here and I'm gonna
take my razor and shred it
and then I'm going to be sick and my
guru snot I like to use the yellow one
with the orange lid
he was like majority all of them like I
like that purple one with the red lid I
think was it whatever it is it makes a
huge mess
all right so boom
that was my first be here and now I'm
going to be putting in another one
probably like right here
come on it's not okay so this needs to
be glued down so I'm gonna put some more
glue right because clear clearly is
okay it's not my first soup and I'm
gonna do what's here
my other swoop is gonna go right here
and I'll actually get a start on this
side as well
I'm gonna let this side come down before
I do it baby here so I'm just gonna go
ahead and start plucking out some new
parts so that could be plucked some blue
couldn't go right here oh it's a baby
here going right in this direction I
already see it don't cut it too much to
get it sometimes if you have you here
forming in a certain way your baby here
to like be like easy so I like to go
like this I might do that on the base
down and kind of source easier for me
other than forcing baby hairs and
forcing those out here to swoop no I'm
gonna take my sugar shred that piece off
here so sticky because of the hair glue
then I'm gonna take my little spot right
there
Jeff's nice right there
there's a nice little baby here
we can like you sir hi I'm safe
what's the price so that's a little
piece right there I don't like how it's
all clumped together though so I really
like to take the cone yes yeah do it
like that and I'm probably gonna take a
piece from them right here
no not right here not this piece just
pieces gonna go line to here take a
peaceful mic right here that's one chair
so just a little bit great here that's
good and I'm gonna do my little sideburn
action and then I'm gonna take my brush
because this is curly hair so I'm gonna
take my brush and I'm just gonna like
swoop the rest of the hairs back so
they're not all up in the way
I kind of kind of like to cut it going
this week so it cuts the McAleer from
like that cut slam to them this is my
routine it's what I do
so I've always done I don't like it's
have a straight line cuz they're not
feel like I'm a whack like integral in
this whack and it looks like you cut
your baby ears like it just looked like
you're pushing it
that's the next baby here but I'm just
gonna take a little to brush in jog it
back the part that I gelled earlier is
kind of like not laid down no back is
back laid down and then I'm going to
baby here's on swim this is what my baby
hairs look like you're going to take I'm
gonna take my frontal and separate it
from the bundles and then I'm going to
take my hot comb and just take little
pieces and I'm just going to lay it down
with my just so that it can lay flat
with my bundles I'm actually gonna show
you guys an example of high-low I'm
gonna show you I'm gonna do one side and
then show you how it looks without the
other side so this is it
flattening it flattening it flattening
it and I'm basically not really taking
out the curls except for for the roots
and that's just because I want the hair
to lay down flat and I'm also going to
take this part and I'm gonna actually
start splitting them in half when I get
closer to the top so they lay down nice
and flat
take this part and do the same listen
y'all when I say you don't need to get
you up a hot comb so basically now you
guys can see like other huge different
okay so now I'm down to the last part I
put on the makeup and I've actually
changed into a little whatever I'm gonna
be wearing to work then let me make sure
my clip is out of my head so now I'm
going to just flip my hair in half just
like this I didn't watch the bundles
this is in its natural state I have not
put nothing in the hair at the frontal
was washed because you know bleach and
Diet or bleaching that's it
so this is what it looks like I'm not
gonna make it get to cry because I want
it to look just like this like but just
with more curl to it so I'm just gonna
take my water basically just get
everything going basically okay same
