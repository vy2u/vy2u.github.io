and $40 3w whatever and in the 44
developer I'm sorry that this video is
going pretty fast but you know it's
basically bleaching the hair is kind of
basic everyone really knows how to do
this so I just skim through this I don't
want this video to be too long because I
do a lot in this video so that's why she
just move it best but y'all know how to
bleach air already
come on and I have videos where I'm more
sterile on the bleaching it I'm going to
leave this hair complete for a couple
hours like maybe four hours or so just
to get it to the lightest lightest of it
can be in one bleach I'm not going to
double bleach it I just plan on going
blonde website is not - right now I'm
just going to be putting the frontal in
the center of my zone cap I use a
regular dome cap I don't use the women's
one I use the one with the man on it and
I'm just going to be making sure that my
frontal is one or two inches above the
caps below Li yeah
above the cap the dome cap and then I'm
going to be measuring it making sure
everything fits so I can go ahead and
start slowing it down
and by the way this video isn't really a
detailed video on how I make my lace
frontal wigs I already have a tutorial
on that so I'll probably have that link
down below for you to see a more
thorough and slow or version of me doing
it so when I will plug I like to pull
out my baby hairs first so you are going
to see me pulling out my baby hair skirt
and then I'm going to start to plug buck
line at the baby
basically I'm going to be blood sucking
for a little while until I kind of get
my desired look if I see certain spots
that I noticed looks too full of hair
I'm just going to plug the out of
there so it is - my life
you
so I already went ahead and flattering
the track as I went in so that's why the
hair is so silky and straight I already
fired it and I pressed it with my bio
soup I'm gonna show you exactly how fat
is hair I'm just going to be doing it on
the frontal instead of showing you guys
on here so I'm going to be using my bio
silk as my type of oils soaking me spray
whatever oils that I'm going to be
putting on my hair it's just a flower in
my hair and as you can see I'm going to
be using a paintbrush this is something
I purchased off Amazon it's kind of like
when people run their cold through their
flower and except this would have brush
so really make sure everything gets
combed out so if you guys are interested
in purchasing one I think they do have
them in certain elegant beauty supply
stores but I got mine off Amazon like
four dollars I think hey guys throughout
this video you are going to be seeing my
black ass elbows in my arms my arse are
sunburnt okay I don't have asthma I
don't have anything disease right now I
wore efficient it two weeks ago I don't
really be in the Sun like that so I
sunburned
and I've been house all day so it's
taking my skin forever to even back out
so that's why I got those polka dots on
my skin I know I look crazy
all right so this is a final look of how
I did one side I'm not going to report
the other side you'll look at my arms I
look like a freaking reptile this is
like ridiculous I cannot
alright jaw with the walk back to my
channel
so it's like been forever since I've
been and of course I am NOT for one you
don't be talking about people all that
kind of recording and I'm not deleting
nothing don't ever watch anyway yeah I
about to show you this way that I
mustn't show you how I play this wig um
I've seen the bleaching process and
everything that I did will be included
in the video I was actually going for a
lighter color but sounds like now I'm
not only to over again like it just too
much is just so much but I'm
surprisingly the hair is like really
still soften as much person even after
I've lipstick so I'm going to be showing
you guys how actually it's like I've
already shown you that I created this
way I've been doing a lot of questions
about swimming with your people and if
you are local and live in Florida like
Miami Miramar for Lauderdale compliance
areas like that then you can follow my
hair page which is at least by chard on
Instagram and DME for enquiry about that
but I told you the whole Sydney hair and
I'll make you a good event like
that was too much and like maybe when I
start selling hair I can make something
and them out but for now if you are
local and you live in South Florida I
can definitely make you will you guys
drop off your weave girl if I can make
your way so a base five sharp Instagram
is where you can do it anyways I'll go
ahead and put the sling on first thing I
want to do farther that is the lace is
I did this and I'm listed place I did it
twice even though I didn't swipe this to
see white how bright and also being I'm
not gonna lie they got really bright so
I'm really doing it but I'm going to get
some makeup and I'm going to use my bare
minimum bare minerals pro and I'm going
to be using it in the color so much
she's fixing my wig so you hear the
excuse so I want to be taking my
foundation powder and I'm just going to
be definite onto the lid of the lace I
just hit the lace in the body hasn't
asked me how I set my laces and I don't
want to really tell you yet because I'm
like literally testing out a bunch of
things like I've tested out te options
out here guys like I haven't really
found out what softly I would say set
for me so what I do is basically figure
out what set for me I'll definitely be
sure to let you guys know you can see
balloon alright yeah I'll definitely
have to guys a little when I fight
something that's actually sturdy and
working good but right now I don't
really have a solid thing I've been
testing other stuff I just figure out
which one is acting a bit but for me so
far using black tea has been like one of
the best ones for me only thing that I
see the black key might make it like
more reddish then stop this car but
we'll figure it out I'll let y'all know
how's my makeup look you y'all coming
down below it's only because I was up on
makeup and over like two weeks now and I
went 15 last week and my face covered
sober

yeah no I think the are there but I'll
guess on my kids dog so I'm kind of
feeling when I act like it is so if it's
like I don't not give advice and I know
when they go for a while I feel like my
intent to be like how I did is like I
don't know the one I smell makeup like
it don't sit well but I like traded down
with big plus and I'll see you mind
