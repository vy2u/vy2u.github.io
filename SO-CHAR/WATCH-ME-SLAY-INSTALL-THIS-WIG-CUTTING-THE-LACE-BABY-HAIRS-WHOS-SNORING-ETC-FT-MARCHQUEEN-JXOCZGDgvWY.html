majority of the hair and also now I'm
going to be doing the frontal of the
here
hi guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm going to be doing another hair
install I'm really think I'm gonna be
telling this video like how I install my
lace front wigs my lace front toe weeks
how I install my lace wigs basically so
this is here from March Queen hair and I
did make it into a wig people ask me do
they come in waves or am I making them I
do make them this is what it looks like
and I use the dome cap and it's just the
front two and bundles I'm wearing
Brazilian straight hair I've been on
like a straight hair streak so next
install is definitely has to be curly
hair well besides that blue here I did I
did want curly but I want some curly
hair I haven't had curly hair and Wow
like I'm gonna get into my Dominican
Society for me so curly hair the next
hairstyle that I'm doing period anyway
so this hair is from March Queen hair
and I'm wearing a 22 inch frontal I know
nobody on here got a 22 inch front so
hold on real quick oh okay so just
working heavily okay Malibu Malibu had a
little 22 inch front - alright so but
sigh I'm not gonna go through its
probably other people too but this is my
first time ever having a 22 inch front
school and not a lot of companies do
have it or offer it but March Queen hair
does have 22 inch rentals and I honestly
like my frontals to be long because my
bundles are long and it goes in with the
hair rather you having like if you have
say you're wearing 20 22 and 24 and your
bundles in your frontal is a 16 or 14
like it's probably the stomach right
here and it's gonna look matte dumb and
it's gonna look thin over here like you
wanted to look all that she's influenced
out there so this is the way the bane of
the hair the hair line came pre-cut it
was very nice the next video also that I
upload I will also show you guys how at
least nods and
have it customized to my skin tone and
I'll just do like a full adapt video on
that so this is what it looks like right
now the lace is very stretchy and it is
then it's not too thick and the lace
came into like a like a natural medium
color so I blended in with my skin very
well I haven't cut off the ear tabs of
the wig so I'm going to do that and
another thing I get a lot of emails over
and over asking me do I make way
commented it for me to make them awake
I am local and I want to kind of keep my
youtube channel and my hairpiece channel
separate so if you live in Florida and
are willing to take a drive to Miramar
Florida for our county I'd be willing to
do your hair you can follow me on
instagram at least by Charlotte which is
my hair page and you can set a deposit
and we can go from there but emails
taking WIC appointments and taking like
wig wig inquiries basically I do not do
so for all the emails no I don't have
ways on hand read already if I do have
them they get posted on my list by sharp
page and that story if you guys know and
I only sell my used wigs on YouTube to
you guys like that's really what it is
if right in the near future do decide to
make tons of links and sell them then I
will but for now I'm only focused on my
youtube channel laced by char and I'm
going to be starting my hairline wig
making is not included in that unless
you are local you can come to me and
drop your hair off and pick it back up
depending on how my schedule is and what
my schedule is but that's how it goes I
don't make way to me the hair I
make it away then ship it back like I do
not do not do not do that okay so now
that's out the way um I'm gonna go ahead
and try on the wig by the way the bundle
is 22 the the wig is a 22 inch
frontal and the bundles are 24 no 26 28
inch me and I think I made this slit too
small not too small but it fits like
right there and also a lot of people
complain about when they do the stocking
cap method that you can see the rim of
the
cap if you do it and you do it to your
color and you do it the right way and
you lay it down flat you cannot see the
cat even if it was bald you would not be
able to Oh hmm sometimes oh my god end
guys I'm going to be doing this I report
I've been doing middle parts too much
like look there's no cat like find the
cap anyway so oh I like you already and
it's not even done so I'm gonna be first
things first I'm gonna adjust it on my
head and make sure I like it sitting on
my head the right way
so that's good I can't believe I'm doing
this I work and now I'm going to take my
comb in I'm basically gonna be centering
out the middle of my head this place
this company oh and I by the way um the
hair is that its natural state I've
already washed the hair with some
shampoo and conditioner and I let it sit
in conditioner for a little bit so right
now I'm basically going to be parting it
in the center and the reason why I'm
doing it this way is because I just
personally like it to be parted in the
center so when I apply it it's applied
kinda evenly I'd like to do a little
marking so I can pretty much see
basically where the lace goes and where
it stops with the glue and pinpoint
certain areas it always comes out a
little bit more right by the brow and
then I'll do this so
the wig is on the head I'm gonna go
ahead now and cut off the lace
don't worry I'm over here and cut off
the lace so this part gotta go and when
you're fighting the ladies I like to cut
as close to the hairline as possible no
no don't cut the hero
all right like on the air and then also
on oh I got to get this on camera this
is gorgeous
I want to be clamping up the sides so
they don't get in the glue and I'm going
to clamp up this side and then I'm going
to just slide it back so no I can just
put the glue on and then slide it
forward with no problems okay so I do
not have what I regularly used I usually
use a little stick so I'm gonna use this
end of this makeup brush in huh I don't
like to repeat myself it's one note that
I don't have to repeat myself but I'm
gonna go ahead and tell it again for
those who are new to my channel alright
so the glue that I'm going to be using
is Walker lace tape ultra hold glue and
I haven't in this clear bottle because
it's easier to use that way so you guys
can find this to online at your local
peace fast or just google it and it'll
take you there or go in sepia twice or I
don't know which piece bastards have it
and which ones don't
so I can really be specific if you can't
find out if you stress or check online
so now let me get close to see if I can
see everybody want to see you I have the
mirror now so no more struggling with
the makeup palette anastasi barely
doesn't wanna run a song palette you
made me some money I just want to say
thank you
alright so now I'm just gliding it on
remember you saw the hairline you came
out a little bit more by the brows and
for the part that look a little you just
blend it in like just like if you were
packing awesome lip gloss on your lips
I said look welcome doesn't like lip
gloss
just put it on like you'll put it on
some gloss
you want to be careful close this
of stinky gets all my makeup everyone so
I make up a lot so the sideburn makes me
got it rolling it in and and you're even
and now I'm going to do the other side
I'm gonna let this boot dry I'm gonna do
the first coat in the second coat I did
the first coat already I'm gonna do a
second coat off-camera and when it's
fully dry out come back and we will lay
this way down together so I'll be back
in like 20 minutes but yes for you guys
okay so now the glue is dry I'm going to
be laying it down I'm gonna lay down
this side then I'll lay down that side
so I'm gonna take off the noclip and I'm
going to pull it forward
and then keep pulling forward as you put
it on you want to rub it around so you
don't have like a harsh line up or
anything like that won't put it forward
right here I'm going to have it right
here alright so the first side is now
been cooled down and now it's time to do
the second side oh I hate when it tries
to leave on his own anyway I tell you to
do that and then lay right here right
here looks really bright and white I'm
gonna need that to do something I'm
gonna just let it dry somewheres
probably still really wet in this side I
mean of course always gonna end up
having to recut around delete your tab
so for this side it's my glue right here
on the face
okay and Fred this is what it's looking
like I get to zoom back out some this
side is like rope glue right here but it
needs to dry off in the meantime I'm
going to be pressing my fingers into the
lace or into the parts that are like
tacky of stuff any parts that are too
sticky I will not touch and I'm going to
here already in my face in my fingers
I'll be pressing down this time and
because I'm like a time schedule I don't
want to have this video too long I'm
gonna be and plush I'll be complaining
my videos too long yeah I'm going to
start parting the hair you want to start
parting the hair yes sir
hopefully hopefully and then I have like
you know my baby fans rushed me Russia
died my videos like going hoping this
out it's like excess glue over here you
know not I'm gonna wipe off my makeup
good this is the alcohol but you
definitely need to clean that you don't
have no thick sheets and coat of glue on
your hairline like it does not look good
press it out so I'm gonna split my hair
into two and I'm going to just go over
with my flat iron and press it out and
then I'll come back to lay down the
front of the hair like alright you guys
so I've learned majority of the hair and
also now I'm going to be doing the front
a little bit here the guy behind is
Norman or in my bad for the snore last
