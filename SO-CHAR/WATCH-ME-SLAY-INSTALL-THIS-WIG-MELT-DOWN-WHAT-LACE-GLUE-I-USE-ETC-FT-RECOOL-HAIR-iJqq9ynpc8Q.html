today I'm basically going to be showing
you guys how I install my laces so
basically this is the one is looking
like so if you guys are interested in
seeing how I got this look and how I
installed my hair from scratch keep on
watching so I have my makeup right I
don't want to show you guys this because
it's like a doubt but this is the face
powder that kind of works for me and I
started to use it on my lace and this is
actually an extension powder this is the
bareMinerals pearl bear Pro performance
wear foundation powders I suggest that
you guys use or to arraign but I had
this one and it worked for me so good so
gotta use it and you're just gonna like
nightly just dab and cover the cat
it's kind of pretty fast I'm gonna press
this part a little bit lightly because
this is the part that always ends up
coming out and looking orange so just go
over your center part or the side part
that you're going to wear your hair on
lightly and on the pattern that I like
to braid my hair in it's basically a
basic pattern I just split it going down
the middle and I just make the braids
follow down middle I just figure out
that way like kind of like basically
that's how you'd leave your hair if you
were doing with soldiers always but I do
that so my hair just because I feel like
if it's flatter and it looks better in
the braids last longer first isn't going
straight back just my opinion
I don't know like you don't know how
much I wish I could like record more
videos as much as I used to
it's like not at my channel like picking
up I'd be like so busy but
before I was like spending all my time
making video they're uploading and was
it like you don't play like that but now
it's picking up and like I can't even do
your put on a record as much as I want
soon this is so annoying
but I don't work on Sundays I refuse to
work on Sunday so I'm gonna give you
guys Sundays and Mondays and Tuesdays
and being in a week so now that I'll
cover it all the way to the color of my
closest to my tone and not dark to my
I'm just I'm just gonna be picking my
gut to be gotta be and I'm not gonna go
all the way to the corners right here
I'm just doing this part and I'm gonna
tell you why and that going all the way
down
I'm gonna give it about eight minutes to
dry and then I'll come back and I'll
stick it and show you guys how I stick
it check it in the meantime I'm just
gonna let this air dry okay so now I'm
gonna stripe I just basically pushed it
down especially align my ear and as well
for this side
all right guys so as you can see I've
cut the corners off and now I look like
an alien now I'm going to be taking my
way this is the wig that I made and I
got this hair from reek old hair on Andy
yes it's not oily express I think they
have their own hair company either way
I'm gonna have the links down below to
what it is so this is hair for Mariko
hair would you believe this is loose
wave hair like look at how straight and
sleek it got I was gonna film me getting
it to this color but I kind of have a
video similar to this this is the same
color I did magenta the l'oreal high
color magenta and it's just basically
this one has more darkness to it first
is the first one I did so I'm gonna be
taking I'm just put it on and of course
when I parted it and put it in the
middle I was falling the middle of my
what you called it the middle that I had
it on the wig so of course my middle
part is uneven it's enough when I do my
installs I like to Center the middle
part so I know that I put the frontal on
correctly
all right now you can probably see my
colored cap like crazy but once this
baby is on there won't even be a cap so
how I like to cut the ears is I put the
cap band over my actual hair and I'll
part it to where I don't have any hair
so right here is the cut apart so now
I'm gonna be redoing my part
yeah basically say that this right here
is the surgery
yeah
that's basically the center for me right
there looks crazy
and of course I didn't turn it on but
yeah I know
I'm gonna go ahead and comb it down and
then I'm gonna reboot it on yeah I'm
going to try it on again and see how it
fits and I have cut off the ears
now I've tried it on and it is fitted to
both my ear tabs I like the feel of it
I'm gonna actually talk all this behind
my inner thighs it as well to this side
with my ears as well I think I'm gonna
cut it a little bit higher on this side
but for size bed it fits perfect
now I'm gonna go ahead and put it in a
ponytail because I'm gonna be cutting
off the lace and I'm gonna be moving it
down and I don't want the hairs to be
all up in my face all right so I'm gonna
be taking this little wooden popsicle
stick and I'm going to be pressing it
well getting the glue and I'm gonna put
it on my forehead and I'm just gonna go
lie down my whole hairline but I do put
on my hair piece by piece so you will
see me doing section by section when I
am gluing it down but I put the whole
glue down is one all right so first I
put my first bench which is right here
at the center and I'm gonna just take it
in I'm gonna glide it across my forehead
too
I see house freakin strange that crap is
it's so basically I'm gonna do my second
collate wait ten minutes to my second
coat wait another ten minutes and then
I'll be back to show you can I still
read something like the next step which
is cutting off the lace and then gluing
down there okay so now that my lace is
dried I'm gonna be cutting up the lace
and then putting the link on my head and
when you cut the lace you need to cut as
close to the hairline so then you won't
have just lace gluing on your head I'm
going to be taking the wig and starting
to place it on my head
alright so now I'm just going to be
taking be lacing in here and I'm gonna
be laying the topic I'm gonna just go
ahead and pin this side back so I can do
the first side first right here let me
zoom in for you guys I'm just gonna take
it and place it right there push it in
along the hairline and - I reach - all
right
until I reach to the very end corner did
what my finger any hairs they get
trapped in that glue I can just pull
them out with my finger oh yeah this
part is trick me isn't that going down
in front of my hair like that all right
you're probably gonna have to recut my
ear because I already feel a part where
I'm comfortable I'm gonna brush the
hairs back and my fingers I'm just gonna
keep I'm actually gonna take care of my
hair comb in just basically brush it in
make sure everything's glued in
everything I'm gonna go ahead and start
styling it and basically customizing it
and plucking it some more and stuff like
that and I'm gonna go ahead and pull it
back down
you
okay guys so I think I've completed
about ohan into my bomb piece right here
this session look fuzzy - like I feel
like do not hit I'm gonna record at the
bed versus when I don't record
you
now's the time for me to adjust my heart
definitely needs to be you see how I
keep pressing my hot comb and it's just
not getting us flat that's where the wax
stick comes in and I've already told you
guys multiple times about this wax stick
but here it is this is the Cara every I
told people the name of it you people
that freaking pay attention well this is
the Cara wax stick and I'm going ahead
and putting this align the front of my
thumb on the front of my baby here and
baby hairs
nothing take it go like this the hair
mine my hair the Front's of my hair just
to give it a smoother cleaner natural
look and I'll do the same with this time
and it comes off as a wax but once he
touches it it kind of like melts it so
you're definitely supposed to use heat
and then this stick so now I'm already
like full-blown pressed it so now I'm
just gonna be now that I've fixed my
hair to my like hands I'm going to be
taking my cheese silk infusion not too
much and I'm gonna basically rub it
through my hair get it through ends of
my hair oh I hope my laptop doesn't my
camera doesn't die cuz we're almost
finally finished I feel like I've been
making this tutorial forever I'm
probably gonna end up splitting into two
so once again I'm wearing here from Rico
hair rakul hair I'll have the links down
below and I'm wearing Brazilian loose
waves but it is pressed out to the tee
and it's just so full and nice I'm
wearing a 22 24 26 in weight 22 22 24 26
and a 20 inch front so I'm just going to
be taking my flat iron and basically
going over it cuz I had it in a bag so I
know that some of the curls
some of the straight parts are not as
straight as they were before I put it in
the bag so any part that doesn't look
really sleek in straight I'm basically
pressing it to get to that point then
I'm gonna go ahead and do this side it
got really really straight for a deep
wave like the hair was like that deep
wave for loose wave like the curls were
like mad serious like they were even
like the curls were so strong like even
after I did the L'Oreal hot color thing
the curls were still there so being that
they were there after the memorial high
color just proof to show you how serious
and technique scrubs word I will
probably end up washing them and wearing
them and the curly state but for right
now I am on a straight streak on a
straight strike which I just called
myself I meet up with me and said I'm
going on a straight strike and I just
want to wear straight here for oh wow
okay so that is like basically you know
what I'm gonna be doing it and that's
why this beautiful hair got straightened
but basically I don't know what I'm
gonna talk through this probably one of
my highlights nice alright guys so this
is the final look and this is what the
frontal is looking like so I like it I
think it's really really cute I'm
looking kinda enable to have a party to
the side but at the same time I'm not so
I'm gonna leave it in the middle and
just have it like that I'm gonna pull
some of the hair sooo front so you guys
can see how good it looks
it's so silky and like so flowy it's
like the best friends forever alright
