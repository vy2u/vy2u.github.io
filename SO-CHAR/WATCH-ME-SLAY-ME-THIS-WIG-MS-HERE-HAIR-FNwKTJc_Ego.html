who you by got me want to take a bubble
baby right next to my channel so today
I'm going to be showing you guys how I
achieved this straight moments look with
my hair remover respect in some big ears
if you guys are interested and just
hearing tutorials and keep on and I mean
world life when your face being for
delivering it but I'm like so happy
alright so so the first thing I'm going
to be doing is taking my gusty blue
obviously I was the other one way more
than the black one like the young one
dries faster and it is less sticky so
right now I'm on top only my face is
done I'm into my foundations because
that is for a whole nother video but
that is why I just have over action on
that so stay tuned for my foundation
routine so also access foundation on the
rim oh right here so that's why it looks
like that if you see that little line
right there yet little bit of foundation
on there and it's definitely going to be
discussing my second color squeezes its
whatever that we do so hey
y'all I miss y'all I miss record I know
this been a while but I'm back y'all so
and that is this madness it I'm going to
just take my blow dryers home and try it
make sure you drive with cool air and
not hot air because hot air does not dry
and it melted all right y'all
so I don't know if y'all remember this
girl but um this is my little burgundy
beauty from his hair care company and
I'm not alive just has been rocking with
me but as long as salad I see neglected
is strong morning for a little bit but
asking pulled this little baby out and
came through with it if you guys
interest are interested in how I got my
hair in this color and how I made this
week I'll have it all linked down below
cuz I did do a video on it so let me
pull back in so is baby hello now if
they had my subscribers hello oh I'm
Cameron you got the wig off oh yeah hey
mommy
alright I'm gonna throw it all Nick
alright alright so Oh see here's an
issue that I'd be happy to
and I will tell you how big this issue
and this is which sometimes you could
kind of see the line of your hair cap so
you got to like adjust it you know say
like right now containment suit Elan
when I first threw it on you definitely
seen your line make sure put in the
middle
another Schmidt Navi are required in the
Schmidt all the time school now I go
hang a lot my hair be parted in this
middle and now you just want to type it
down um I know this little creep but I
did spray some water on it to loosen the
baby hairs from previously I know the
world of smell on it double reducing it
maybe a darker edge they just drive away
so they just look krysta can feel pretty
I mean maybe it is Christmas we don't
fix we're going to be taking
now that Island histo budget I've
already previously cut this frontal and
everything I do have a video on lifting
your knots and everything like that I
have a video on how I got it covered in
this whole pack is still waiting room
she won't wash even at home many interns
video part is my favorite part
thirsty all right now so as you may know
already next things first is you to
brush you got to see it to do brush and
do this work that I got me a little for
the baby girl already and I sleep like
this place in pairs go behind my ear so
before I do it I'm going to tuck it
behind on here no can do to me I'm going
to show you how my gurus not but it is
so junkie and footed here right now so
this is the Grossmont that I'm going to
be using um I look I'm really on the
hunt for a different type of Joe Delaney
lay my baby hairs you know first it's so
sticky I hate it I hate it but
I need the stickiness of it in like the
mess that it create it's like super
super annoying but this club is sticky
is it you seen it all this like this
total comfort and I think it just gives
me like more trouble and I'm trying to
do my baby here because of the
stickiness on it but I Nev another
chance with these matches and that other
job that I switch off Motorhead not deal
as control girl wrong I'm not gonna tell

rim of my hairline and a little bit on
like the tops of my ears like my baby

try to hide the folks who might hide the
lid like so to blend more so when I do
my makeup cause I found that since this
is like burgundy in some of the roots
are kind of burgundy and I do my
foundation and a place on in the night
