channel so today I'm going to be doing a
tutorial um hair tutorial of course
basically it's gonna be a watch me slay
this hair so if you guys are interested
in how I got this hair laid and
hopefully then keep on watching so as
you guys can see I've already might glue
down the lace to my head so what I'm
gonna be doing now is just doing some
more plucking flat ironing and doing my
little baby here basically just
customize them more to my Vikings so
this is a custom unit that I whip out
that I made and I'm wearing right now
and this hair is from beauty forever
hair I'm wearing a 20 inch frontal and
my bundles are actually three thirty
inch bundles
I am three bundles of 30 inches I
actually had four bundles but I couldn't
fit it believe it or not was hit being
30 inches they do give you a lot of hair
so I was able to just squeeze in 23
bundles so of course you know I got in a
simple middle part how I like it if you
notice the hair is super dark and that's
because I dyed it jet-black so yeah the
first thing that I'm going to be doing
is taking about edges to brush and I'm
gonna do some plucking and basically
figure out my baby hair is also just and
asking me a lot about these two brushes
a lot of people don't have them in their
looks local Beauty Supply stores but the
beautify so that I do purchase these for
my
repeat hold tell me son what he said he
would so are we adding these to my site
for you guys I'm gonna go ahead and just
begin with my baby area and that can
basically just customizing it

and say it's really quick but I love
when I'm doing my clients here and maybe
like can I get that loose right yes

like some people don't like it because
some people begs me to like no smooth no
little front sweep right the kingdom at
that it's always like what they like but
when they do that's what I'll be like me

finished my baby hairs oh I didn't do
anything too crazy just a couple of
swoops but I got started Mike going in
with the hair so it don't really look
too much as it's baby hairs huh now I'm
going to be taking my frontal and I'm
going to just hot comb it I just like to
do this just it's just my routine
okay so now that I've pressed it out
basically to my likings I'm just gonna
go in with max iron because this is the
hair in its natural state
I haven't yet floured it or anything so
I'm gonna just split it up into and so
iron it that way I'm gonna go ahead and
if I get too into the hair I need to put
some cheap on it so I'm gonna just go
ahead and run some Chi in it

did have to do plucking it wasn't that
free plug but it was plucked enough but
it wasn't like no Batman hair line so
yeah um the hair took to color well I
used um I used the Garnier and
nutritious ultra color and I use jet
black and blue black I don't know but I
always like to mix that together because
