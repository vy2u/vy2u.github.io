she's nothing like you
she did her and she's nothing like you
she met a violent Ellison she loved me
better and better she loved me better
and she made me happy she made me laugh
she brought me when you let me down
could you hold a time look on with Allah
cuz you hold a title you know
could you hold
this is just to keep it clean and keep
any dye from getting on it I like to
keep my dome that's clean so I'm gonna
be using two bottles of huckleberry blue
in one bottle ocean blue polka bear boo
I ended up mixing it with conditioner
just to get it to a lot of consistency
so it wouldn't be so strong on the hair
unfortunately the second half of the
video where I showed you guys the ends
was cut off but basically I used ocean
blue on the top part and I also use
huckleberry mixed with conditioner on
the top and then I use huckleberry by
itself on the bottom I'm sorry that it
got cut out I don't even know what
happened to the video so now I'm just
going to be taking my makeup as you guys
can see the lace is really yellow but I
took my makeup and I kind of just
pressed it into the lace and pressed it
in on the hair so I can have more of an
illusion of my real hair
y'all know I love my own so I'm just
gonna be out coming the hair down and
I'm gonna begin to start cutting off my
ear tabs accord my ear type cutting them
off off-camera it's kind of hard to do
on camera for you guys to see but I just
kind of cut out that pull out that piece
and then I just basically cut exactly
out of that so that's what it looks like
let's cut off all the way
so for those who are gonna ask I am
using the clear white glue and it's
called ghost bond glue once again it's
called ghost bond food
you
so I've been using this new brand for my
baby hairs it's btz beyond the zone and
it's called bata being jail
I really like the jail it smells so good
so that's what I'll be using all my baby
hairs
alright guys so this is basically the
final result of the install from what
I'll say the lace was a really really
yellow color like it was really like not
like no one's skin like duck image no
girl's complexion the lace itself was
really really yellow I don't know why it
was so yellow but it was like crazy
alone so another issue I had was that
the lace didn't want to lay down I had
to tie it down with a scarf in order for
the lay down that's the method I like to
take I just tied down with a scarf but I
usually don't have to take that method
if the least is good
not necessarily the lace is good just
usually I don't have to do that step I
shouldn't really have that many issues
with the lace so that was the issue
it wasn't laying down I ended up having
to tie it down a scarf um as you guys
can see I got it to blend with my skin
so if you look in a veil when I was
coloring this hair the hairline was like
so that many I don't even do what fronts
was with that type of hairline but I
made it work and I mean I can always
make you work I just choose not to
because it's a lot of work but I plucked
the hell out of that friends like I
plucked it in I think it's like so much
more that could be plucked is how much I
didn't plug like as much as I usually do
so yeah um the hair is stuff colored
really good I have them in the
description box the products that I used
to cut this hair I've also had to insert
it into the video of what I used to
color this here but yes y'all I'm not
gonna lie I really won't be keeping this
hair in for long I just don't wear
colors like this and it's really really
not me so I'm not gonna keep it as
hearing folks who long I might just take
it out tonight I really don't know I
really missed filming for y'all I don't
for as much as I
should so it's been a minute since I
posted it almost anyways though um so
this hair is from supernova hair and I'm
wearing a 20 inch frontal and 20 20 24
24 and 24 3 bundles 24 inch here as you
guys can see the way I colored it I kind
of made those ends get darker ask you
guys whether I should do yellow or this
color and y'all chose this color so here
is it's alright like I'm not a huge fan
of it but I like it like I just don't
I'm not comfortable with this color and
being this bright in a way but anyways
I'm probably gonna keep this hair in for
a couple more days and let you guys know
how it holds up but for now I'll be
honest I do have some issues with the
lace and as well as when I put when I
was putting it the hairs were kind of
popping instead of pulling off so it
kind of looked like a shaved area versus
how it usually is but anyways I got it
together I made it work cuz I can do
what I do but yeah that's all for this
video hope you guys like this tutorial
let me slide the camera back
so y'all can kind of see what it looks
like this is it that's cute
like it's cute but you know you can't
walk around bare with this you just have
to have a face your face being stuff it
can't be like just regular plain chain
with this color here anywho just wit
will be doing the selves so y'all stay
tuned for it cuz I know y'all some
people don't want it it might not be
everybody's cup of tea but I've noticed
ourselves so yep hope you guys enjoyed
