the first thing that i'm going i'm
already grouped on my cap i skip that
whole part i know usually my cap looks a
lot better than this but your girl has
some difficulties today so it's all
types of whatever um today i'm going to
be putting on my deep curly wig and this
link was purchased from me and this is
my hair i've never did a review on my
curly hair so I would just like to give
you guys a raw nut cuts of my career so
basically this is what the way it looks
like I already put you know my love
makeup on the rame and whatnot um I dyed
this hair jet-black it usually doesn't
come a dis dark black a but I dyed
jet-black so yeah alright so first thing
I want to do is chart on the way
I'm gonna go ahead and just cut off my
ear tab and get that part out the way
this hair looks so forgive me I don't
even know why that's this big
so here it is
here in your start something right here
right here so ya know it's basically
reminders they slide it back a little
bit more I want to be like at this point
and basically like this alright
compliance we take heed
so I know y'all had a moment apart so
today I'm gonna be doing the middle part
but I'm just doing this part like that's
what y'all I just like a little shoot
this way so I can kind of have a
guideline on what part of the hair is
the center and what part is the side so
yeah so this is just that we part the
hair put it on evenly but the way don't
get many do it you talk like this this
so basically once I blow it down and if
we do it down right here and - right
here just face my ears
really
here
you think mayor's hat on this side might
be a little bit trouble so you want to
be careful to cut your ear to have
because these are your cyber I don't
really like to mess up over there my
favorite part in the lace situation
don't rain so this is looking up right
beer you follow right here
right here continues to follow all right
so I'm just going to slide the wake that
son and now I'm going to get to the step
where I began to put the glue around the
rim of my hair this part I don't know
why but my Chapel is like a hot mess
today it's really not messing with me
continue okay so my camera stopped
recording I'm not too sure all the part
cut off and I don't know why I stopped
recording but hey I've already put on my
first coat of glue and now I'm just
going to go ahead there's this crazy I'm
gonna go ahead and just put on my second
coat of glue as you can see the glue is
already started to dry it up pretty
pretty fast I like to in between
changing fingers I'd like to run walk
the old thing just so I don't have all
this extra beautiful fingers
all right now I'm just gonna get into
blue again so straight here right here
you always need to grab those strings
the years it might be stubble your
forehead just hate happen like it looks
messy to me when you have like your lace
down and it's like random strings pop
nut everywhere that you chose me really
really crazy alright so now I'm going to
go ahead and just lay down the lease
here's what I considered to be my center
part and I'm just going to take my
finger and just press it in right here
right there and I'm going to take off
the clip and put the clip on this side
because I'm going to start to move this
side down first so you just place
forward and press it down first if it
gives this skin look how it just like
moving you know this feeling
alright so I've got this side
I'm going to add some more glue to the
first property
like my hair is too long I've made
weights with this hair before and I got
wash it it doesn't really seem like I'm
actually gonna do like a little side or
action type of thing I never do it's so
big I'm gonna show you guys all the
setting that I'm getting as I rub my
hands to it not to mention that I've
already like oh my god yes
so five asanas videos up these are gonna
be added on my website so I bought a
bunch of these wholesale for you guys
cuz a lot of people ask me like what do
you get in it how can I purchase moon I
can't find them in my Luckies my stores
so I got him and I got more sales so I'm
actually gonna be only selling these for
$2.99 not that expensive but shipping
will probably be like five or six
dollars so that's what it's looking like
with these so these will be actually
available on my website so y'all can get
him
yeah so I do want to start with this
value more since I have like way more
going on on this side I'm gonna just
make this side my sideburns side and
sideburns
I'm actually gonna hot comb the hair
back some so it's not all in my face and
then I'm just kinda guess y'all know me
you my cold someone was like what's the
purpose of hot combing it and then
what's the purpose up straining it would
outcome and then wetting it at Craigs
back up and it's like maybe you watch me
on you or you don't pay attention but I
don't use my hot cool tools that aren't
here
I use it to lay down the hair so it lays
down flat and it's not too big or in my
face falling forward in my face and I'm
also wearing my front to is a 20 and my
bundles are 28 22 26 s so this is the
only three bundles of long hair and then
all right I was thinking I'm going to
start the big hit
I'm gonna do this peppers and I guess
I'll jump into the next side

after their own on
go mixed you know don't get me yeah all
right so now I've applied the lace and I
put down my baby ears
I'm feeling moving here it's a whole lot
now I'm going to be wetting the hair and
making it look really pretty and nice so
the first thing that I'm going to do is
think about wax thick this is the
Caracara wax stick you guys see me use
it almost on the videos you know I'm
just gonna take it and I'm gonna just
backs up certain areas that I want to
stand up this type of weird you need any
and I'm just looking for someone to
decide as well and like here make me hot
