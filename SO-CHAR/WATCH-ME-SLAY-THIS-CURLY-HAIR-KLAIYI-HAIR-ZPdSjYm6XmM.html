it's the pervy yo be they ready let's go
to my channel so I knew I'm looking
crazy but this yo honestly I'm give
y'all quick insight on this hair this is
hair from Kyla he hair it's some of
virgin hair company online I told you
guys already that don't do unboxings but
I'll have it right here on how it came
packaged nicely in everything like that
so all right I do love this head i
catched I'm gonna rocket straight at a
feather passed by a few months so I'll
get like super excited super get quick
detail on this hair this is a jury curly
hair I'm not sure whether it's Brazilian
approving I have to definitely down
below but I know if your shirt is like a
Jerry girl hair and I'm wearing a 20
inch frontal a 22 on the bundles a 22 or
24 and 26 3 bundles I fit all three
bundles and like this hair is huge like
even with like the deep curly hair in a
deep way hair it's never been this big
here I'm gonna go I'm gonna do like a
little spinner on see doesn't see
yo this here is huge
anyways I'm going to be showing you guys
today in this video I'm gonna be doing a
little bit of baby hairs and customizing
some more
and also I'm going to be showing you
guys how I basically tame my curly hair
like you thing I will go out in public
where they look at it like this I look
like a way better version of shove a
corn but anyways yeah that's what this
video is going to go to stoke who didn't
some so I'm gonna move my mirror - right
here sighs ever see absolute let the
lighting be better when it's like I
don't know what is so bright around the
room my forehead I think is just that
light forehead is super ten all right as
you can see there's like no baby hairs I
know it's not listen already
this right here is about to be anything
digital this is about to be my sideburns
right here actually right here are these
evolving just some more tweezers I feel
like this is enough you know what you
might get used to
now I've lined up the toys for you guys
like this numerous times so you got a
basic you already should know right now
the basic steps to this little thing I'm
not really gonna get into much detail on
it so I'm gonna do like a few babies I
love to have me a little stripper baby
here right here like eppley right here
and low spot for you baby hairs
and this fronts will already came like
pre clips and all that so I really
didn't have to do that much fucking to
it r+ it already I'm just doing this I'm
just pluck you from baby hairs right now
but this then this front so the hair is
super pretty in it doesn't rectangle but
it is a shutter I was gonna be fucking I
mean I'm going to be checking back over
this not and like over the spot that I'm
using is the I don't know that the
purple one but this is not like a
blue-green color I'm gonna take my
little ready to brush I'm using a detail
out of this tooth brush cutting the baby
hairs out basically just brushing them
into place
never you'll end up too much baby hairs
but I'm gonna be someone also suggested
to me that I do my baby hairs because
I'm like you see how much foundation is
right now someone suggested that I do my
baby ears before I do my foundation and
I don't really like to do that because I
feel like when I do that then like the
foundation will sit on top of the baby
hairs and then up to me it looks like a
tape line so I watched my I watched
listen like I watched my videos and I
look and I analyze myself and I analyze
what needs to change and what needs to
be better and what needs to be a pro so
I noticed that when I do do that
ends up looking like a tape line or
something like that like so I don't
really do it don't really think that's a
good idea but I mean
I don't mind my thing sludges for a
little bit I think that drives all clear
and it comes back clear so for this shit
this hair is too big for me like my baby
are getting messed up and shit and you
only that story time just move your big
ears because that's what starting a long
time you start to get your home
harder to move with the flowing shit
that's not going already and I guess
we'll do like some another swoop over
here
Oh
I'm gonna take some gel and I'm gonna
kind of like push some of these hairs
back up in my face only thing that don't
like that is the frontal is like a major
share with them so that's what the first
side looking like you know what else I
made about the here is that the frontal
the front of the curls on the frontal
were like to the room you know usually
it'll be like you don't really meet to
meet it don't become system won't it be
like kind of nice not almost a straight
line that straight and then curly but
this week
this one's will look like curvy period
curly not going any support because
these rentals I mean it is the what is a
lace ice pepper me I'm gonna want to
record it so much back at what they are
the sarios back at it again when they
win
anyways I know for sure though that I've
been getting a lot of egos because I
said in one of my hair tutorials
I said clearly I do not sell wigs I do
make waves for people that live in my
local area and the reason why I say in
my local area is because I don't want to
be going to having to wait for you to
shit me the hair and then mean I'm gonna
make the wing and shit the best way I
feel like that's my way way too much you
know I'm saying so because that I told
you guys that I do make weights if you
try to do lifts in Miami on my city but
still I've gotten tons people are still
coming and emailing me the enemy
asking me what I hear you address on my
youtube channel like some I like going
can you make me wait and ship it out to
me I can shake of the hair and I
specifically said that it was like Haiti
weekly or something ways and there was I
also asked me do I so any of my wigs and
I told y'all that's like people just
probably don't even listen to me or my
videos like they just click the video
see the cute thumbnail clicking watching
everybody business because that's really
what it is like I say over and over and
over again the same thing anyways though
a lot of the emails that I didn't get
pertaining to that same person don't get
responded because that hurts me feel
like I'm not vouching for peeing myself
I already wished that answered your
question and I'm not but to keep going
after the same thing over and over and
over and over again I said on my channel
I say what I do I've said what I thought
too so I'm not gonna keep saying it's
the same thing over and over again like
it's a duh
I read show soap isn't all the big ears
are about to do listen to the baby here
I'm not going to do it over here I'm
just gonna let that rise all right now
I'm going to give you some of my cheese
so confusion let me put y'all on to some
game I'm gonna be going ahead and
putting some of this on my hair like
this the front part I just want to turn
that sleek shiny with knot and just know
I like my baby has to be like flowy and
pretty enough crisp look I've been do
some plunging on the frontal so that
might be why there's some shedding but
this hair isn't mom
physical edges some fucking but I've
been losing a lot of hair but and I've
noticed that like some spots are
starting to look a little bit faulty and
mind you this is me this is like my
first day learning it like that's the
only thing but this very so pretty it's
so pretty
alright so now I'm going to be taking
some more of my cheese this shit smells
so good
I'm just moving I'm just rubbing some of
the cheese into my here looks I'm gonna
get some shit if you don't
wait come back just a little update and
I'll let y'all know like about the
shaking this whole time I'll let y'all
know what the shittiest the shitty if
the shedding is me or not
alright this cheese stuffed cheese most
little bit about stuck okay so let me
fix my we're trying to fix it so I don't
create a camera but I need to see
alright so this just has water and a
couple drops of conditioner first thing
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give me an
inner size with my hair at the inner
footprints in my hair just because I
don't know why just because you never
first oh I don't have my earrings on
here I'm gonna basically split it in the
middle
you know this hair is pretty
I've never tried keep coming before I
girl what she was waiting no more only
thing go it's huge and I coulda sworn
that I've got some teeth growing that
coming in and like shorter links so like
I don't know how I'm gonna do with that
because if it's this big and lonely like
I don't even want to see you that
shortly I'm gonna running my hands do it
and getting combing this like comb it
out them you need to make sure I don't
know about y'all but I wish my friends
will be like oh the other side like did
that give that like good way like any
coming throw at this one like it
and I also see you're lucky I'll be like
coming for me based on how I do my
friend tools or how my baby hairs look
like the last time I checked this is
Charlene's channel this is definitely
shot so sure does her baby has two
prayers like if somebody called me rude

coming from me period of awareness
