this you're wrong
so never touch a pathway
what's up y'all so today I'm going to be
doing a hair of you and a wig tutorial
um install video not how to create it I
know that you guys asked me to make a
video with a closure and how to make one
and I don't wear closures but it's I
finally order the closure so I can make
you guys week and um I left my camera at
this I left my camera at home when I
went to the shop so I wasn't able to
film me making the wig sorry my nose is
like really watery
anyway uh anyways I got this little
scarf on because I had my cap on one end
until I might put my wig on yeah I need
to see it's coming back anyways though
this is hair from a large you there
so it's EUL 8ir I haven't listed on the
screen and I'm wearing four bundles of
20 28 inch and a 20 inch closure I did
make this with myself I promise I don't
really do closure too much this is
probably my first closure ever but the
next time I do decide to wear a closure
and I will definitely have a video made
for you it is like oh it's the same
thing as making a frontal unit but it's
a little easier but it is more sewing
but anyways I was able to fit all four
bundles and a closure this is what the
wig looks right now this is it in its
natural state I haven't really put any
water on it or did none of that good
stuff and this is just what it looks
like real quick I just want to add in
that on a lot of you guys asked me if I
tip my lease and I used to be into the
tinting laces when I first started doing
it I used to do the hot team method with
black tea but I just feel like the black
team makes the hair feel really and just
makes the lace feel dry like it kind of
dries out the hair it's not filled but I
don't do not know steps I just like to
use my makeup I use the foundation of my
skin color and I just go on from there
the leaves and it works perfectly fine
for me it looks really natural so yeah
the clothes already came a little pre
plug so I just went ahead and plucked a
little bit of it itself but don't have
that I didn't film that part cuz I think
sucks a lot probably gonna plucking warm
once I see it on my head but I'm gonna
go ahead and just get my foundation
powder and my brush so I can just put it
on the lease so I'm gonna give you guys
a closer look of what the lace color
looks like don't do my nails y'all I
know I need a refill so this is
basically the color of the lace which
doesn't really go with my skin too well
and now I'm gonna take my foundation
powder to my skin tone and I'm just
gonna tap it into the lace just keeps
acting just keep so I'm probably gonna
ask my comments but I'm wearing some of
my lashes right now that's it you know I
do have a lash line it's on my website
WWE em we're in the style Lyra these
ones are like more natural compared to
Chanel or on the social ones so these
ones I like a natural version I'll show
you guys what this looks like now now it
looks more like my skin tone versus how
it looked before so I'm going to take it
on take off my scarf so I'll go ahead
and show you guys what I look like
underneath this this damn thing it's
annoying on this side I don't really
care that it rolled back but I did go
ahead and spray down this side and do my
little routine I only did this little
piece and I cut it off and let the rest
of the cap roll back because I don't
want to end the way showing and at the
same time I just need this little space
for my closure I'm gonna go ahead and
try the wig on and see what I know
oh let me know if y'all peep my thing No
little more action but for those who
don't team is so tight for those who
don't know I use a and then you see how
you can see my then the hair is gonna
fall over that but either way yeah there
is not fall over and I'm just tuck it in
all right so this shit's tight so it's
so tight um I forgot to mention that
this method is gonna be yeah glueless
cuz everybody talking about your gloopy
blue don't do I mean do do not it do do
I know what that means what that depends
on how much you use it how much time to
use it you don't give your hair a break
and as well as just know and also how
you remove the cool okay it's not party
all right
so kind of pluck some of the hairs on
the closure so now I can't comb it out
on my fingers do it
I hope that if I'm getting oh if I get
shedding this is probably from the hairs
that I plucked if it continues after
didn't definitely hear it look oh
that shitty anyways alright so now that
I've got my part I think it's all pretty
censored how I like it
everyone says that poachers tend to look
a Wiggy but honest I don't think so I'm
just gonna go ahead I think is the same
as the front so it depends on who puts
it on these are tweezers I think it
depends on who puts it on alright so
this is what this part looks like I'm
gonna go ahead and pull between that and
I'm just gonna be plucking out here warm
or just give myself more of a natural
look
okay so I think I'm like just about
plusted enough I'm gonna go ahead and
now take um go in between with my hack
home so I can no Ernie not
flowering it's Manny
you
sorry I promise come when I wash it it
was probably like this before I washed
it and then when I washed it once this
but that should burn Moscow just now
yeah make sure the brushes on the
closure this way so it'll all be in my
face so now you can kind of see the
reason why I do the hot comb routine
because this is nice and like flats and
this is like how you don't just we used
to like marking and just put a drop
right here and also put dot right here
right there right there right here the
reason why I did these dots is so I can
kind of follow how the closure goes when
I put it down let loose so now I'm going
to just cutting off the lace and I've
kind of have been debating on whether I
was gonna do this like a luminous method
or was I just gonna use glue and I
decided I do have a foolish method on an
eye I do have to glue this method
and this is like nothing yet not even
like no foot I'll show you guys my
little clueless method that I'm doing it
I'm going to be lifting it up and
putting it back here so I can now I'm
not gonna be using glue I'm gonna be
using a gel but I don't have my soldier
hair so this is gonna take longer I'm
going to be using one layer of got to be
and then the second layer of gonna use
the doctor beat this one and then I'm
going to use the difference expert but
first I'm gonna use this one you want to
put a light layer because you don't
really have this I'm gonna let the first
round dry take it
I think my captors fighting back that's
why I like doing do this yeah but no I
don't think it's fine but I just haven't
mean with those people so I'm gonna wait
a while I'm gonna probably count down to
three minutes and then I'll get back on
the camera in a little bit
all right y'all so I'm gonna let it dry
for a couple minutes now I'm just
calling it up the wing and um put
this thing on before this caps lighter
tomorrow like look at it just wanna
 did you do closures close these
niggas be stupid
so mark wrap this slide a little but
it's all good and I'm gonna probably get
myself some baby hairs cuz I'm not me
without my baby hairs so that's probably
what I've ended up doing the first I
find some pieces to probably have one
right here looking at these piece of the
hairs got a just took brush and a
freshly washed right here and simply
tuck get closer to y'all go see better
all right so that's basically doing baby
hair
yeah we let the little fool break so
that's one shut them up that way
just wait no
I'm gonna do my here no this this
you
hurry I'm not gonna just readjust my
middle part
once again this is the Kara Kara wax
thick it's super easy to cool I'm not
gonna going on where you can find it at
every place fairies with happiness
lipstick well it's not stupid I love it
but it varies
you're very zone where you can actually
own fine this sweat think so this is
what the front of my hair looks like so
far
Parton looks pretty good
and basically just press that out
just like that and then go ahead and
take my other side take my colon plate
ah place it in that direction
do that
at the time I can't push back way same
for this part push back away just like
that so you guys can see the hair more
I'm just gonna have it spooning in the
middle and like I said this is 28 inches
over curly hair right now I'm going to
take my spray bottle I'm not gonna over
touch the hair but the clothes stretch
the curls out and this is Brazilian deep
if you go east night neither my hair is
all done and I look good my lady lady in
red alright so this side looks like it's
good nice hold this is the body body
fine moves with sweet I would owe you 7
extra hold thermal protection and
moisture and shine and this is by smooth
and shine Popish you guys got to see
like um I'm gonna just take a little bit
and I'm gonna show you what does it does
like a little bit turns look this is not
going off right you know it gets like so
this was host that word they'd be saying
a little goes a lot and had enough
footages and get it through the years
and there's one all right so this is
what this side looks like versus this
size and you guys see it's all tamed and
lay down
which I'm more sentimental alright
enough of that so this is um what the
hair is looking like you did have some
curly hair in my life no I'm saying the
Spanish team look Dominican no I don't
know
yeah so Wow well this is why now this is
the final look I'm saying just say no
