I'm gonna be good showing you guys
basically how I die my friend tools
before I do anything to my friends I
like to spray it with some got to be
glue free spray just so I can kind of
make it like a shield I like to do it
this way I feel like it's basically
shielding my friendo from the glue
another glue but the dye sticking
through or if a little bit does get to
it wouldn't stain in it or stay stuck on
my lace so I like to spray it down with
some trace
all over squeezing the bottle and just
making sure it gets everywhere nothing
too major or difficult
okay hey guys so well now that I've
showed you guys how I got it this is
what the final outcome looks like and
the curls definitely lost their what am
I say they're like the crews dropped
like really bad a nice try to wet it and
spray it and I'm just not liking how
it's coming out so I'm just not feeling
how it's coming out so I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna want curl to the air
so when I wanna curl my hair I usually
just like to split it in half I like
honestly you guys I'm feeling this color
it's pretty you know but this is really
not what I was going for how we kind of
going for that orangish color but it
came up in the Sun it shows off the
orange II but here come on I look super
bright it's showing up like a reddish
type of tone I need to readjust my
settings I think so what I'm gonna do
now is I'm just gonna brush out
it's like something is stolen from when
somebody is still with me when I first
tried to wet it up some and see if the
coat come back but that's fine come back
to me but it still won't it was half
white because the one chromed I have
it's long you can do that they're stupid
I thought they call it like what to
drive some like so this is what
this guy's looks like in this side looks
like I'm gonna take my hair pin and I'm
just gonna clip this oh yeah alright so
first thing I'll be doing is taking a
piece which will need this big old chunk
and I'm gonna just you know okay see
this is oh I forgot to mention as well a
20 inch frontal and the bundles are 26
2012 30 28 26 24 and 820 I was only able
to fit three bundles in this here yeah
so as you can see I twist it and I just
wrap it around wrap it wrap it wrap it
wrap it
until you get to the last bit of hair
and you want to leave it on for a few
seconds I'm gonna yell seen a video when
I girls trying to teach bro how to crawl
in here and her freaking hair fried off
yeah yeah I'm recording a video I'm
filming a video
kill me chat later bye I'm gonna go get
the stuff outside but she always gonna
come right here to be wounding it and I
must warn you guys that this is a little
super long inches so like when you wanna
come home here the crew loves to like
drop so I'm probably gonna hold it for a
little bit longer than I usually do
oh my god it's perfect
I threw this hair and my fingers for me
look at my damn shoulders it's a
struggle when your water from your hair
anyways all I do guess women I have a
wig for sale and isolated so we get a
nice but anyway guess like alright whoa
whoa nothing weird yeah I got a wig for
sale now it's gonna be mad 360 hero hair
I honestly was barely trying to keep it
in for as long as I could so I can't do
an updated review but um I wasn't
attracted when he's last night I don't
know what came over me but I snatched
that right off and so I'm gonna lie
I already don't wanna give away that way
 I don't want to give away that
way book that's already really do like
that way and be straight here it is
super weird to find like long straight
hair that don't have split in skin looks
right at the end so on that 360 wig is
red you like that
don't look right at the answer nothing
like that that's why we love the way you
can just do it I went like oh we went a
whole I hope me one like a whole week
without flowering and the hair was just
a stage string and say it's so pretty so
that's some good hair I'm gonna be right
back alright so now that you kind of
have an understanding that you can see
how the loan coats are compared to the
long hair just grow nice now that you
guys have got a concept of what I'm
doing I'm gonna go ahead and speed up
the process I'm gonna have to speed up
the process good once I start talking to
y'all I've been talking talking talking
talking talking in the video and they'll
be a claimants long and then it'd take
like three days to upload so I'm not
gonna overhaul so I'm just best back to
this part
all right so I'm wearing sole lady hair
from Aliexpress and I'm wearing a xx
frontal and my bundle of 22 24 26 and 28
I was not able to fit the 22 from one
more 24 20 22 24 donut right 24 26 and
28 so I like I said earlier that when I
died the hair at least it it did lose a
lot of curls so I went ahead and Wan
crawled it so now I'm just going to be
taking some of my bio silk and I'm just
gonna be giving the hair some luster and
some moisture because I'm gonna open it
up with my fingers and I'm just gonna
basically make the behavior really a
bigger and more you guys this is not the
color I was going for it
I thought paprika what I used a door by
paprika I thought that it would give me
a color that is more of a toughness is
orangish but it came out like this I
don't want my camera to die anyway guys
