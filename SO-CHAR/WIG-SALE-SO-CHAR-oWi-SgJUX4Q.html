the inside looks like it's full lace
there's lace all around the rim it's
kind of going in the shape of an actual
hair line the cut around the ears are

my hair and I like the front tools all
the laces come already pre pluck so as
you can see this is what it's looking
like and it's already been pre plucked

gonna go ahead and insert a picture
right here of what it'll actually look
like on I have that one self right now
and the curly bob is only going for a
brand new curly bob is only going for
350 so this is what it looks like
so yeah I'll get it under Stalin I was
rocking this curly Bob and this one is
not used this is actually brand new one
I actually sold that one that's Ari that
was on my head and next Lee I have
another curly wig and this is a curly
wig which is made out of a 20 inch
closure and for 26 inch bundles no 26
for 28 inch bundles this is the hair
that I actually recently just had on and
I took off and this is verse
and curly that I'm wearing and this hair
was from you they're here so this is
what that one looks like and that curly
wig is also going for 360 it is used but
it is four bundles of 26 inch hair and I
mean I think it'll probably cost you 360
around that price for just the bundles
and the closure so you're getting it
with the bundles of closures and the
whole entire week I also have all the
prices down below for you guys see and
then the next week that I'm going for
set up for sale are these that I'm
wearing right now and I have them in
custom units and the first one that's
for sale is 18 inch frontal and the
bundles are 20 to 20 note 20 22 and 24
and that is going myself for only 380
and these are brand new never worn
custom frontal units I actually put up a
picture of what they look like
I'll have it right here and I also have
another one for it that's a 20 inch and
it's 24 22 24 26 and that one is going
for 400 and then I have another one
which is 20 24 26 28 and that one is
going for 440 and these students are all
brand new never been worn and this is
basically what they look like and this
is what they look like if you watch my
