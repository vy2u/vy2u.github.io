today I have for you guys which is today
which is eBay fines video so I've been
collecting kind of a lot of things I
mean I have way more stuff than this
it's just that all my purchases are kind
of like not there anymore so I'm really
based off like most of my recent ones
which is for like a month or two ago so
I have a couple different things to show
you guys I got some glitters and things
like to show you alright so if you're
interested in watching the things off I
don't eat because I am like a eBay
colleague then he watched show you guys
are 4 pairs of shades that I've gotten
from eBay and I don't remember I can't
remember the price I'm gonna be looking
at my phone to tell you guys the price
these are the first ones they came like
this they came actually they have their
own box I don't know where it is but
these are them and they're in that high
say it's work wife turquoise j-rock
Curtis Turner I think it sturdy but it's
ugly sticker came right off so these are
them
just don't keep shades closed besides
you have to start everything will be
linked down below as well so these ones
I got or 790 and the next ones are these
these are my favorites they're just
really big
they're like tents it barely even are we
like when are we learning this I'll be
feeling myself it's a little too big for
my case but these are them
and the ends have that tortoise type of
pattern style the next ones are these
like pinkish purplish ones and the
trimming on them is gold so these ones
and you can actually see my eyes to
these I'm not too sure all these I don't
know why I kind of ordered them I got
four like I'll probably never end up
wearing them but they sit crooked it's
like been some years without breaking
but
yeah these are these are what they look
like
I like that you can see through them I
just wish the top was not like this I
wish they were set like these ones and
oh I'm sorry I didn't tell you the these
ones or these ones were 1095 and these
ones or seven and 99 and the last ones
are these big friends I had these before
well maybe I had these before and I had
the ones where I was clear at the bottom
but I went jet skiing and they flew off
my face so I got a new pair and I just
thought I'm in black and they're just
like this simply nothing really much to
it and I'm sorry I forgot to mention
that those sunglasses I keep forgetting
to mention things but they're not listed
here let's go so I'll probably go back
and just attack them a little the next
thing I got is this one pink and black
cheese okay here is and this is an
eyelash case
I bought this because I just wanna have
just like being my Percy stuff because I
always take all my eyelashes and leave
them around like my eyelashes are
everywhere in people's cars get balled
up in my bag like they're there all over
my car so like I got these walking like
be able to reuse my lashes without them
being all crumpled and nasty and keep
this in my purse so anytime I'm tired of
my lifestyle just whew and put in there
right and the next thing I got is oh and
that was sorry if I forget one more time
225 the next thing I got is this pack of
12 pearl waterproof professional lip
liner and lip pencils lip liner lip
pencils I guess I haven't even opened
this yet and this was about 298 I think
I seen can't remember her name I know my
name is brie but aside beauty's by brie
like she does like that tons of emails
and I've seen her get some of these oh I
think there were these so I just thought
I'd try them out since I am trying to
build my collection of lip liners
it really gave me 12 these are some
pretty colors I guess because I just
stay here these are just too light but
okay forget you didn't these are just
like to build in my collection I guess I
don't think I'll be using that many of
these colors they all look the same but
you know they're really not in a little
sense away but I'm here I'll swash about
tool for you I'll swatch the color
0:55 and 0:58
so this is 0:55 and
oh this right is right cuz they were all
58 so they do have a lot of pigment to
them they look alike but the bottom line
is more burgundy not just start burgundy
as it looks but yeah so those are the
next thing I got is this black mass deep
cleansing purifying peel-off mask and I
mean I've seen at one point it was just
a lot of people on YouTube and
everywhere doing masks and stuff like
that and I actually wanted I originally
wanted to try out the egg one but I
could not find it so I ended up just
getting the black one and this is it I'm
not sure on how much it was I think it
was about four dollars but it's not in
my recent so I have to get on my
computer and look it up I'll definitely
link it down below but I would say I
used it a couple times and it kind of
hurts pulling it off but you definitely
do see like it definitely does give her
two bites of blackheads it kind of opens
up your pores and stuff not your butter
kids what are those things called inside
your nose
it opens up your pores though and gets
all that crud out of your nose and stuff
like that I've used it a couple times
I've used it fully on my whole face and
I recommend that you don't do that it
didn't break me I would do anything to
my skin it was just like when it finally
dried off it was just really painful to
pull off so I usually just use it here
here and here where I mostly get oily
and I feel like I need to clean that out
the next thing I got was you may don't
click me these back lashes I'm gonna
show you these lashes do not laugh I
mean I don't know I I run through lashes
a lot so I know I just I thought I
brought them for the video but these are
them I only have two pairs left honestly
these lashes are great like I really do
need to order me some more I use them a
lot I actually don't have them on right
now which I knew I said I was gonna wear
some but I end up wearing some Koko
lashes instead but these lashes are very
balm and they're lightweight they kind
of remind me of like the iron lower
lashes and the biggest name ones but the
vegas-themed ones that I would say that
everybody says it's lightweight but to
me it's so heavy on my eyelids like I
can only take it and probably make a
video and take some pictures and take it
off but I can't go out with the pond
there's so puppies but these ones are
really lightweight only thing is that
you do have to be a little gentle
because you know they're from China and
China don't really give you everything
official so let the hair who might come
off if you're too rough with them but
besides that these are like some great
lashes and they came in a pack of
five pairs and there were only 77 cents
only some more right now like I have to
work I'm gonna order me some more right
now cuz that's it right there they're
great great okay the next thing I got is
this eyeshadow palette thing and it also
came with some brushes I don't know
where I put the brushes I'm truly sorry
but it came with a set of brushes just
some normal brushes like but this is the
color I got this palette actually before
I got my morphe palette I was actually
trying to buy the more colorful palettes
that's why I got this one I wanted to
test it out on your kit out birth before
I would even working one these kind of
remind me of like the shape
these kinda remind me of like the BH
Cosmetics palette I would say but in a
way I don't know how the texture
difference is but I would say that these
ones are pretty pigmented like some of
them are very pigmented right
the ones with shimmer seem to be like
way more see that
see that and yeah that's
ooh and let's try definitely
they are going to powdery but they're
very blendable and here from this one
I'll show you
this blue using the different finger
yeah they are very pottery but
they are very very pigmented just a
little pottery so you just have to be
careful with the amount that you pick up
cuz you can ruin your whole face if you
pick up too much product with this one
it happens to me a same when I was doing
my purple look so that's the palette and
this palette was about
999 and it comes with 120 shadows
I was definitely at least on the flow if
you guys are interested
everything will be linked down below so
the next thing I got was this bewitching
streamline liquid liner pencil when I
got this I didn't know that it would be
I thought it would be like the easy
sticks like this is kind of like a
marker and I'll do like a little swatch
on it it comes off like a marker and
this was only 77 cents ebay fine who can
you see so that's it and let's see
what's next the next would be a replica
Kylie look it so like I don't know if
you guys seen my makeup haul video but I
was explain to guys that I probably
wasn't going to show you this the lip
liner broke the packaging looks really
official but it's really not it looks
just like the other one my lip gloss my
rogue lip gloss but this is it and I
have got it in the color okay this is
like exposed what is wrong with you
everything basically sorry hmm
everything basically looks the same as
if it's a real one I would go and
compare them but
like going to memory so this is exposed
I don't think expose really looks like
this
so this is my orange I've got a sore
knee I don't know but this is what it
looks like and it's mad supposed to be
met
it just never shines I was so freaking
pissed my stupid friend came over to my
house yeah and then the lip liner is
broken my friend came to my house and
she was like oh my god let me get in it
she opened and try to swap just watch it
the back piece broke off so you know she
said bootleg but she came to my house
she fixed it but she kind of ruined it
the lip liner just wow there it is me in
the lip liner stick though the lip liner
doesn't even show like you don't even
know doesn't even show
yeah so that's it I just got it just to
get I was gonna actually do a comparison
between the Ronin and the fake one but I
ended up getting a gloss and not a live
case so I couldn't and that's it for
fake party cosmetic dish it looks real
though like rocks will throw the
packaging on throw I think the only
difference is that the sticker at the
bottom of the room one you know the
first brush I got was this big flat top
brush and it's supposed to be like a
replica of the is called its cosmetics
brush and this is it you know what I
haven't used this brush because I don't
I just got it from my makeup collection
to be honest I don't wanna use brushes
this big and stuffy I don't know what to
use it for no much hair did your room
what is wrong with this chair like I
have two words chair in the world like I
definitely need to get a new chair and
stop buying all these eat this stuff
maybe I need it wouldn't be a chair on
eBay so this is it and it's pretty soft
as you can see like how the hair flows
and stuff like that it doesn't really
 out here and go some out but that's
it
I don't remember the full exact price
for this I'll definitely have to just
link it down below but it was nothing it
wasn't even more than I think five
dollars so this is brush the next one is
a brush set I got on I don't remember
how many came in it but I'm gonna guess
and say about I know there's one more of
these I don't know where it is so one
two three four
five six seven eight this is not part of
it one two three four five a second all
right that's another one of these I
don't know it is so I would say about an
eight piece set or maybe it's all of
them I'll definitely make these down
below these were nothing more than eight
or seven dollars less like probably
seven dollars or eight dollars or
probably less I would say to you I'm
gonna be rubbish all these brushes are
everything these are the brushes I used
on my face every day I use this brush
every day I need a wash it's all clumped
up with foundation and stuff but this
rice to put on my foundation I used to
use this to sleep off to my setting
powder but now you realize that this one
works better you know what the other
brushes right here cuz I was using it to
fix my face before I recorded I quit so
it's eight piece set so this is the
brush - this one I use this one too like
if my face I thought my forehead in my
under eyes were a little too light so I
just got my bronze and I was just
buffing it all out and trying to just
lower it down lower down the brightness
I guess
so these are them and
see these are like soft brushes I
probably washed him in these I haven't
had him for that long I'm probably out
of like three months or so and I washed
them like probably three times every
time they get too clustered stuff like
that I'd give them a wash but these are
them and should I wash them before that
the video obvious my thing to do but I
really did forget about them and these
are them so these are the little fringes
I use these I think this one these two
these three I've never used this one is
still clean but these two are freakin
known it's these two the flat tops where
to use water to cool supposed to use
these four because I tried to use it on
my eyeshadow and just to blend it out
and it sucks but if I need to blend out
my eyeshadow these two are my go-to
brushes as you can see there's orange on
it because I was definitely using it for
this makeup look like these brushes are
my babies I love these are part of my
everyday I've like a section of my
brushes that I use every day these are
intense okay
in the next set of brushes are these
those bootleg real take me something
something metal addition I don't know
brushes these brushes right here these
are for decoration I only use these
three and I use this one one time to
sleep off my foundation I don't know
about other
and it sucks it's really this one I'd
say this one is really hard I've never
had the real technique one so I can't
really compare them to you I do have
some real technique brushes not in this
style and they are very good and I
wouldn't compare them and say that
they're like but I'd probably say that
they're similar and so this is a one two
three four five six seven piece set if
I'm wrong I'll definitely have a link
down below something more about it
so I have not used any of these I didn't
use any of these until today I was
trying to find something to help me to
blend out my shadow more that's why that
has some yellow in it yeah and I think
it works pretty great it's kind of hard
but it's not too tough nothing I can't
work with and these one I just keep them
because they're so pretty so I just have
them in my makeup I'll make a brush
collection looking pretty I used to use
this to fill in my eyebrows with the
anastasia brow tip but I found my other
brush so I stopped using this one
there's still residue on it and it's
still thick but it's a great one for me
and this is my baby
I use this every day and every time I
said one make up this is my brush I use
this actually to apply my highlighter
because I don't like those fan ones and
having none you know just sit there it
don't work for me like I just take this
and just be
don't rub it in in their game in there
it
yeah it got some residue on it Thanks
you can't see it foot this is the brush
I use for my highlights and these are
them so altogether I have actually some
other ones but those who are trash I
didn't know they were there like I'm
sure you got the problem came like you
came across the one they're flat and
they coming like a pack of mine 1213
brushes they all suck so I wouldn't even
recommend that for you guys so these are
them versus my baby
these are God where these glitters and
there are these little small litters
they're like loose glitters and I'm
going to show you every color I got they
came in one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve they
came in a little baggie nothing major
but these are them this is the first one
which is I guess this is the gold one
and they're really pretty colors I've
actually tried I'm not that good at
glitter like I've been really really
practicing but I've been practicing like
this one this nice purple one I was
trying to do that leader Jade little bit
then I got this red one and then you
know a little silver one I don't know
why it would empty as hell I got anyone
using that much did I try I did try to
use it my friend jacked her up
I'm not even offer then I have this
pretty ones like a magenta or I like a
pink pink magenta then I have this like
greenish lime-green one the next one is
like this pretty turquoise
then the next one is now this is like a
hot pink I'm a little confused deep boy
if I were to lift it ass up this would
have felt everywhere
these two kind of look alike
focus please
do you mind see alright this one
all right and then here's the ball yeah
I should show it to you guys backwards
so these are them as you can see
and in the last one
and make sure every we don't show it to
you from the bet
weren't you covered orange reddish and
then another one this one is like a lime
green compared to the other green this
one's I cook green oh forget y'all right
and this is like the lime green get see
it in the next one the left or the last
one is actually this one which is like a
copper
okay and the last thing I got for sure
for sure last thing is yes yes
the salsa buttercups Sam powder and let
me see
I guess the color that I got it in is
buttercup this is everyone I'm not sure
if this is the real one or not cuz even
be playing but when I bought this I paid
about I think almost 20 something
dollars or 15 if it's not here I'll link
it down below bingo it is here I paid
$15 for this I think the original price
for this is $20 I think but this is it
when I actually bought this I bought it
off eBay but when he came in the mail it
came through Amazon so I was really
confused because amazon kicked me off
and that's the new business but I use
this powder every day and it is very
very yellow I'll make a message to
everything with the little lid thing
that it comes in in here I'll just dip a
finger in
can you catch the yellow thank you so
that's what it looks like I think it's
pretty good I have no issues with it
this is actually the powder
this is actually the powder that I used
to do my face every day and my recent
YouTube makeup videos I probably was
using that one I tried using that
airspun one but it's too light for me
like it's too white for me for my
complexion so but that one is a cool one
so I just I use it it's so wide I just
use it to set in my eyeshadow primer or
if I'd to consider on my set on my
eyelids I use that she said it because
it gives off that perfect white all
right so that is the last thing that I
will be showing you guys right here the
second thing I'm gonna show you guys is
I'm gonna actually Lincoln's do try to
have it in the box up here and I'll
basically be showing you guys everything
the first thing I'm gonna show you guys
is my ring light yes I did find a ring
light from ebay that's I love so much I
think I got it let me just confirm this
it's just on my screen I got it it's an
18 inch ring light I'm using right now
that's why I can't show you but if I
have it right it should be right above
me right here and this spring life is a
18 inch 75 with florescent dimmable ring
light in the video I definitely will
show you guys it dummy and basically
that is it it came with a bag and I have
bad oh right here you can't put it back
and in the back it has the little cover
for the ring light excuse you
and oh sorry hovering lights tripping on
I got a stupid connection think that I
got it so that is my bring lights and
boom that's it and I'm gonna show you
guys how to dim it and all that in the
video okay okay the next thing I got is
actually an acrylic makeup organizer it
has I can't remember how many drawers it
has Jesus Charlene but I pulled out some
of the drawers it's really easy to pull
out all you have to do is slide your
finger in and pull it out I actually
ended up buying two so it stacks up
really high and nice and it should be up
here and I paid about thirty two dollars
for this 32 for each around that much
and I mean I'm fairly they bring out my
makeup section and they're really nice
they hold a lot of stuff only thing is
you know you can't fit her and stuff
like this right here it's kind of too
big for it so if it was like if this
didn't have a lid and was a bit smaller
it'd be able to fit in it that's the
only thing so this gets left out but I
am gonna purchase some more and maybe
purchase some bigger one so I can fit
things like this in there so my makeup
session won't be sold bunch of stuff in
here and then a bunch of style
everything for this video um before I go
I also wanted to say that I know it
sounds crazy and it's like nothing but I
finally reached 100 subscribers like I'm
very very happy and excited I know it's
like it's only a bunch of subscribers
