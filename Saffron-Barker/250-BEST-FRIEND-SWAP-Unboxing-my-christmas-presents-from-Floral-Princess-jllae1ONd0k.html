exciting so as you guys can see from the
title of the video I'm gonna be unboxing
what my best friend got me for Christmas
we had quite a big budget was doing this
which I know is quite extreme but we
knew that we would have spent this much
meet each other anyways and we feel like
if we spent the same amount as well but
it's kind of like in a bit more fair
enough and plus it is I don't really
have an excuse basically we had 250
pounds to spend on each other so we
really really really won't fill out we
thought would be great to unbox it on
camera for you guys so you can see we
got each other for Christmas so I'm
super super super excited for this and
plus I know you guys love what I got for
Christmas videos so pretty much you get
you get one earlier you get to this year
