a bit blurry on your own
oh yeah it is neat to me I don't do it
myself
like I can't focus the camera myself
because it's so far away and therefore
it's just under an album Buddha itself
basically so it does the cameraman oh
love me she now CHS dude
adios amigo hello everybody welcome back
to my channel right I am so positive for
today's video because I love shopping
and in fact with the clothing or solo
work
I don't know I was going to say then
okay I'm a little bit hyper as you Robin
cow if you haven't noticed already which
I'm sure you probably have but I'm quite
hopeful right now on each other it's
like a chill pill so I'm going to try to
out this video but today I have the
clothing haul no girl like most of
things I'm going to show you is from
Zara the kisara warms my heart it's like
my new home and pretty much everything I
would buy obesity from Zara but there
are a couple of other shops that I've
chucked in now and then so I hope you
enjoyed this mess and it sounds as if
you guys do and also subscribe down
below if you guys haven't already I know
you guys love these videos because every
time I do see a light on my clothing
haul words I literally crazy and the
support is crazy so thank you so much
for that and I'm super excited to get
into this video so I hope you'll enjoy
and let's get into it what is the first
thing I think II haven't even taken the
tag off yet purpose is that that new so
it's a dark green color and it's an
elasticated crop top and then the arms
of that wing which i think it makes it
so much more like special because it
makes it more like a going house
why rather than just working everyday
typical crop sauce that I wear but do
you guys think that wings make it really
really pretty and then he obviously has
the chosen style as well which I
literally love in a sauce and then it's
just like the v-neck as well so I just
thought this was super super gorgeous
and it was 1999 but I know I would get a
lot of youth update on holidays
especially and just going out and stuff
just really as I go that we're dressing
up with fantasy and yes I like it next
up I've got this sweatshirt from River I
know just so many of you guys were
asking me where this is from it is the
confidence thing as I like inside it's
like a soft like fleecy material and
it's so so snuggly and confit inside
it's really cool because it has like
that double like patent frame on the
front it's like split down the middle
which is really like about it and I like
there has a bit of color in it as well
living for the color in my clothes cause
everything's just black and right now
and then like this color of the jumper
it's more like a charcoal kind of gray
black rambling just like jet black it's
a little bit more charcoal a little bit
of when I don't really know what the
color and it's kind of got a little bit
to live in there as well but I would be
again it's got the choke connect which
is you sew it at the moment and I loved
wearing anything with it a good hug
pretty much so yeah I just thought this
is really cool and this foot problem
ever island I love this jacket this is
so cool I love it so much
this jacket is from Zara it's like a
washed out coffee green color season
yeah very washed out and it has like
throughout the pain and I started
writing all over it and then it has just
like little like cool design like on the
pocket mainly mainly white but it has
red yellow and they call my little
designs on it when I saw this I was like
really unsure I was like cuz that was
that not and I tried the odd and I was
like dang that is so just everything
about it and it fell in love with it
it's did some of those things you know
you just have to try it on and then it
gives you like a whole different aspect
on the clothing that was this jacket
makes up another
just from Rara is this beige fitted
jumper if it has a the lace cross going
down the front it actually goes down
quite know that you kind of need to wear
like either a sports bra or like just
you know every pretty brother not really
much to say about it it's just either
mode what is really nice is a bit
different to every other glass and light
clothing that I own in my cupboard I
might be other jumpers I normally wear
this a lot more I can't draw and like
snuggling you know like more relaxed
this was more Fitness that I think it's
the jumper that I was more likely
wearing evening or if I was going up
with friend being next up this was 17
and 99 and I got this from Zara it's
wrong a good shield top it's really just
like a black vest however one side it
has like the other tops that I've been
showing you it has like the cross mace
kind of going down the side and it also
has on the opposite side delays going
down here and then I can tie up zone
which is really cute
there's not really much to say about
this honestly it's just like a bomb top
version of like a burst of it yeah it's
like a less plain based on basically I
know I wear this on holiday it probably
like denim shorts push it's easy to wear
and for something easy just to shuffle
and like round the pool and stuff so I
picked it up also because again I'm
loving somebody next up this makes me so
excited for holiday I'm literally not I
think our clothing line if I go away my
favorite thing to buy is bikini but I
love shopping for beginnings so I picked
up this bikini and this was from of the
Avenue D it colors are absolutely
stunning they just give me all the
summer vibes and then the bottom are
literally the exact same and then it has
like you know like peachy bows on the
side overall I just thought this was so
pretty and lovely pattern on the front
as well also with bikinis as well I love
balloons that I just have like this nice
push up but like push this result but
you know they have nice a little bit of
padding like I'm not really a for Hamill
beginnings a ton completely flat like so
thin whereas this bikini has the wire at
the bottom so it's more comfortable and
also it has like a little bit of padding
in
well we'll tell up in a bikini so I have
to take this one up I'm like living on
this talking about holiday vibe I'm
going to show you the top and where I am
right now so it's a basically a yellow
crop top and it says Manhattan on the
front so it kind of meant a lot to me
because I recently just been to New York
that's the best time if you go till the
logs if you didn't go J for now so I
need to be fed up with this top I just
thought as well is really cool because
you know me you know I love to have like
the splits and carts and talk for just a
military cool and although again it has
a beach oka next slide which I love as
well so yeah this top is from misguided
and it wasn't too pricey I think it
looks like 10 pounds so lightly Brown
well I'm going to make a down by I
actually got two tops alike I have this
in black and white I have to pick up
both because you know when you see
yourself in your life I'm going to wear
that though yeah so I have to get both
colors so if I've got a bit of theme
going on here I didn't even realize but
pretty much every item of clothing I've
been showing you guys it's either late
or it and yes this is another lace
clothing so I got this like white
clothes it it's not really crop top but
it is quite sure so I got this white top
but again has the criss cross place here
the lace on this however is a little bit
different it kind of has like that
corset look I feel like the corset look
is kind of coming in style at the moment
and I thought it was really cool again
and yeah I really like how the top was
like tied to at the bottom so I got this
in white and then I also got it in black
as well and then this is what it looks
like in black next up I got this to top
from this Selfridge if it does actually
have major planets and will just ask you
- is it actually where yesterday but I
wanted to include it in this hole so
it's going to happen YZ writing on the
front and this top is like it actually
is in point out so it's meant to have
that like will shell effect so the top
like I mean yeah if you turn it over you
can actually see the print but stuff
there all around so it's inside out and
it's going to give that
I've washed out the sets which I do
things really cool kind of edging and
then the tops really thin as well and
super comfy to wear so yes basically a
to fit yourself
I have no idea what the right hand sent
by the way so if anybody knows what this
says in English then it please let me
know because to begin to know my new
favorite thing you would have seen us mo
logs multiple times this coach I am
fully obsessed with so it is like a long
washed out coffee green color the jacket
is like really really really sick
cutting it kind of looks like canvassing
and is where these oversized its I'm so
oversized that that's the entire look of
the jacket so it's really big really
yeah over on Fremont and I'm done with
over the back so on the back it has a
big square of like road
pinky gold sequins that I think is so
cool and then on the front it has these
stars that I like pop are stroke rose
gold just like going into Nami ty way
down I guess on the arms and then it has
some on the pockets down here and then
yeah pretty much you just held like
stuff everywhere and I just saw it was
super cool and I love it all and love
level I don't really know what to say
this is one of the kind of we could see
on because it's really hard to show like
this but if you follow my vlogs and you
will see this jacket and yeah I love the
