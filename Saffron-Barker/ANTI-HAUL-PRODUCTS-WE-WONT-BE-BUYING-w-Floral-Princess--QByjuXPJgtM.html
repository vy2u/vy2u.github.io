so so much for buying my father anyways
that is basically why I've got a sore
throat because I've been meeting
thousands and thousands and thousands
true if you guys but anyway is Diana
what we're doing we're doing something
very different actually yeah so highly
requested to do this video and this is
an auntie also basically it's everything
that we wouldn't be buying so basically
these are going to be makeup products to
make up items that we've seen that a lot
of people bought recently a lot of new
popular things that we personally do not
want to buy and we are basically going
to be spending our reasons why we don't
want to buy them so I hope you guys do
enjoy this video it's kind of like a
backwards haul it's pretty great I've
already been enjoying them also we
filmed a part two of this on annotations
channel so if you do enjoy this video
then be sure to go check out part two I
will leave down below yeah without
further ado I hope you guys enjoy
smash the like and subscribe and let's
get in to the video so the first thing I
want to talk about I'm not completely
sure I saw this it's by Jeffrey star an
Aborigine and androgyny and
palate okay the reason I'm not a fan of
this thought of a name aside I don't
really want to speak about him because I
know so many people have different
opinions and it's just like we don't
need the whole YouTube drama strictly
just thoughts on the palate I'm not a
huge fan
mainly because fuzzy I've really don't
like the colors I don't personally I
wouldn't use the colors and aside from
that as well I'm a sucker for pathogen
like I love packaging than hiding weird
just like this packaging just mainly
because I think it looks a little bit
tacky and little bit cheap it feels
cheap like the half the beauty color
palette and it feels and almost like
plasticy oh isn't it really similar to
this one then if my factor was exactly
same okay okay so it feels cheap as well
it's uh Conchita yeah and as I say
colors really aren't might have come up
if you like those colors and they might
be great but for me also they're just
really near andum yeah I felt because
he's going extravagant with his makeup
he's made a palette that's really suited
to him and like makeup artist yeah it's
not really like as for everyday use as I
would buy a palette for and also I feel
like as well even if you are really into
makeup and you like extravagant things
none of these colors go like there's a
random green there's a random purple you
can just take this palette out you'd
have to take up like three different
types of mix yeah you couldn't depend
one look with this yeah completely
so policy I won't use this I would
definitely win you there yeah so that's
my first one Anna let's move on to yours
and by my admission let me know down the
comments as well what you would and
wouldn't use and if you agree with that
or if you disagree about me Anna what's
your third item that you won't be
hauling so my first item is from Becca
it's another collaboration okay I'm not
exactly sure how you say her name I
think it Chrissy Teigen
okay and is basically a whole demeanor
search that except Athena search up it's
basically a highlighter palette now this
is the thing I love the highlighters
like I think the colors look amazing I
love the packaging but the only thing is
when I bought the Becca X Jaclyn hill
quiet and champagne pop it's smashed so
quickly agreed I honestly am I'll eat
Lane barely even dropped it I just kind
of put it on my side just like this much
height and it's matte
into absolute smithereens it was in
pieces and it's not somebody still can
use it but it was just very soft it kind
of put me off behind the highlighters as
incredible as it was it just kind of put
me off it like but I just because I have
so many I thought these are the
highlighters I prefer yeah I do agree I
do love the packaging though for this
yeah I do know however again yeah as you
said smashing wines they're not great
and also I find the actual highlight
inside this palette is very similar to
the other highlights it varies
throughout everything that kind of looks
like champagne pop to a point oh yeah
and that one that's like I don't know
what it's called now they have like a
pink in one yeah it does I kind of agree
what you're saying I feel like I'm
always having fear if I open it like oh
my god it's smashed because I know
that's how I feel what else am i
laughter world yeah but we've done the
house I'm like yeah it's fine but I've
been Becca what I always think to myself
oh no it's probably slash so the next
thing is the milk stick so this is a
brand I'm really intrigued by I hadn't
seen this until I went to America and I
said I love American you should have
talked about it but not I don't think
you can get it in the UK well maybe just
isn't big because I know it's pretty big
in America yeah and I am really
intrigued by it
however this probably the one thing from
the brand I'm really not sure by episode
your primer that's what it is there's a
primer so the reason I don't really use
it it's because I did look at a lot of
like reviews about this on YouTube and
there were so many things saying that it
was very drying and I once I have got
really dry skin but I just have kind of
you know in between skin and I don't
really like things I make my skin dry
out because it's just really hard to put
makeup on top especially if it's a
primer as well like all my makeup is
gonna break out and go kind of a lot
cheap also it's really a very expensive
for a primer how much $35 $35 I don't
let me even go that I don't know how
quickly we go it doesn't look like it
would but I definitely don't know and
also I do like things are like really
unique I like the packaging is really
good I just felt like the way it looks
as well it just doesn't look like a
primer and it really puts me off yeah I
also don't get along very well to stick
no I'm inside my timer just like
literally yeah yeah
like when people do like the stick cream
contour I can't do it very high it's
just hard blend is hard to blend it yeah
yeah my other product that I don't think
I will personally be buying is the Too
Faced white chocolate bar palette Oh
haven't seen this but it's like so
exciting it does say it honestly but no
no guys again so we're putting all the
pictures on the screen right now so
let's have a look what it looks like oh
sure what do you know that's it yeah I'm
not a fan
firstly it looks really plastic I think
is very difference between like really
brassy the plastic I don't know
that was the chocolate chip and there's
the chocolate bar so there's two okay so
this is the chocolate is going to run
about yeah I definitely before you ever
watch it isn't no no that was a no-no so
this is the watch I mean yeah I don't
like the color I don't like the colors
is like one or two like chocolate syrup
love that that's by it it doesn't really
go that name as well like it's not white
chocolate they're very in green is not
much there Vladdy yeah they're really
light toned colors - they're black
they're very light like you couldn't do
like a smokey eye or anything like that
I don't know again these colors would go
together that's all I say also they're
really bad - they have really random
again I understand you have to kind of
put very open to everybody but they are
yeah
like to me that's not a palette that has
a bit of everything it has some neutrals
and then it has some really branded
years that will not go together
so I just think yeah it's funny it also
just never heard of this either they
also seem really shiny they don't have
either glitter or mat they look in the
middle but I just don't get along with
those up I doubt it and they're looking
to like crazy on my eyes but I just feel
like - the green in the purple again I
just had all these colors elsewhere
no white the new they're not made
official they're nothing new and of
course they'll be pigmented but they're
just nothing new personally I don't
think I spend I think it's 45 pounds
yeah
I don't think I pay that aside from that
though I do actually have to face oh
yeah this might have been love to say
that I would be incredible and I really
want their new peach range of you seen
it yes because quality of the makeup is
incredible I think it's just two colors
and that probably is not me yeah and
also I'm not actually a fan of the
packaging when you said that I was like
coming because that sounds so exciting
but the white passage just looks yeah
why do you keep all of the gold inside
but the white just makes it yeah so the
last thing that I'm actually gonna talk
about is the subculture palette by
Anastasia Beverly Hills now this is a
no-no for me and I just say at first I
was like 100% I try this it's not how it
looks
and like the colors you have so
variation it still goes together however
and can I just say actually before this
the anasazi amo termination palette is
one of my favorite palettes of all time
okay well it's my favorite the quality
is unbelievable they're so pigmented
there is like practice to the load fall
back when people ask me I say if
anything is too pigmented because I put
my from yeah it's like so strong yeah
like it is unbelievable
however that's kind of my follow up with
this I thought subculture was gonna be
like this however I saw so many reviews
slating this project I feel like I don't
wanna get it to see what it's actually
like to I've seen it so many reviews
like this is nothing like that it was so
controversial even back it for you to
come one of the questions people were
asking on the panels of what do you
think the service of color palette
yeah it's that strong name like
personally before that I hadn't really
looked at the palette that much okay I
know the I know but they're really
chalky everybody's yeah and like and
everybody says they're not as pigmented
as more terminator
apparently it's a different formula that
they use but apparently Anastasio
actually said that the first batch was a
bad batch that's what I saw I don't know
like I don't know
I want to go bite now to see if it if it
works and it was about like if it was a
bad batch but I'm just I'm just really
confused I just don't know what to buy
yeah yeah the colors even though I would
really use them so you could blend the
yellows and there's some gold and to go
with the yellows it's not too bad right
yeah it's not too random you can use
everything yeah I love the palette I
feel like that color I like the color
and
it's linked with the packaging just like
the red one was linked with the
packaging for the modern mandates on
that's one yeah but it's a really pretty
palette but I don't know it's just like
actually shadow wise I don't know I
don't know I've got to think of the
quality as I said if they did say it's
about that they're just saying well I
actually said that people who bought it
it would be taken back faster because
maybe that is true so maybe we'll go get
it
I know who might hurt from what I heard
was it got leaked that the palette was
coming out so they rushed the production
so there weren't no I agree so when they
sent them out yeah why they were so
chalky so there's a lot of room it's
really not so wait maybe we should go
test it maybe I don't know that's one
one kind of undecisive
so they both went to size for your necks
I really want it but yeah it is so hard
yes and after your opinions down below
