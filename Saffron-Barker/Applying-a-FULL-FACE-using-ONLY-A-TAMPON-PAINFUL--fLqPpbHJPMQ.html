channel now today's video is a weird one
now I've said it so many people will do
different videos applying makeup using
various different items and in fact I
even thought the other day somebody
applied makeup with a condom which I
just saw was so strange
so I've not like me to even wigger and
apply a full face of makeup using only a
tampon
so when you pour this little setup I
only have one you I'm just about to
prove the otherwise and you go I believe
last week I feel confident like I've
been leaving there yeah I feel like this
could work you know so I'm pretty
excited for this video this might
actually work so well that it could be
and everybody's new you know Beauty life
at videos if you forget your brushes
don't worry you've gotta come back I've
complete setting the new trend so today
I'm going to be giving it to go yeah if
you guys enjoy this video then please
smash a like also subscribe down below
if you guys haven't already and finally
approved jump into this video I also
have a daily vlogging channel that you
guys should subscribe to as well which
is also going to be down below yeah I
hope you guys enjoy and let's get into
it work on my headband you're going to
watch this on so no hair gets in my face
this is a such a pretty leather cord
spend it on so attractive love it got my
hair band eyes now it's time it to what
I'm hoping that was like flying from
whatever they just didn't it just come
stay here in slots anyways I got my camp
on let's get into the video okay so go
sort of a foundation my current
foundation that I'm loving is the kanika
beyond perfection a foundation it's
amazing you know it's actually going to
stick so I'm going to apply it with the
stick on my face because just yeah I
kind of asked it again here it goes I
got my camp on today so I guess I don't
know how to do this but if I were to
just I feel like that feels so wrong I'm
just going to hold it on the side and
kind of like mix it around all the kind
of harsh on birthday definitely not the
softest oh gosh it's really hard to hold
as well she obviously can't hold you by
the straight
collision you know what I mean it knees
won't have any control on it from having
to hold it on the top without getting my
hands dirty
it's lending reasonably well I'm already
seeing is that the tampon is starting to
expand because obviously what they're
meant to do is they draw up all the
liquid and already after throwing up the
liquid and I have a lot much coverage on
my face hospice on the tampon and the
tampon is expanding this is so where and
also it's fitting
it feels so rough on my face right now
like it's the hardest piece of tissue
ever had to use in my life but it's
actually kind of like scratching my face
okay so that is the foundation on the
plus side my skin feels very exfoliated
right now so maybe when I actually take
up my makeup tonight in May so a little
bit fresher make a little bit too right
you definitely scored of the dry skin
okay let's move on to concealer so it's
for my concealer I'm actually going to
put it on to the tampons earth now I
think I might be going to put it on the
tip and I'm going to try and use it as a
Beauty Blender by kind of like doing
dabbing kind of motions because that's
how I tend to do my concealer on an
everyday basis I'm hoping if I the only
thing is though it's getting rid of all
my product which is sucking it up so
this is really hard I'm having to use so
much more than normal now I'm just going
to dab it where I was not with my
concealer and where I would normally
blip oh that is good
it's good I'm just popping it on my face
to be honest okay now it's time to blend
it's our boy yeah I thought what we
might be here all day
ah three grand we're not getting
anywhere this is so frustrating every
time I do this it hurts my face I feel
like I'm digging my face out oh we're
just not going anywhere which is really
all it just doesn't want to move it on
my face and it just wants to say is that
see where it is it is just don't want to
move clearly examination isn't working
so I'm just going with the actual
rubbing motion I mean this it prove
I work a lot better but it actually
flipping killed my face like this this
was like the saw of course my face so
much oh my goodness is makeup actively
hurt this much every time I put it on
well I just I wouldn't I wouldn't wear
any government hurt as much honestly
so I'd hand ones a little bit destroyed
at this point but it's all good we're
now going to contour my face so I've got
this booger I've got this top right here
I'm going to use the bronzing shade nice
sharp yeah let's get that shot with your
line yeah see that guys summertime fun
okay
it just is this is really not wanting to
go on it like it hurts by your teeth as
well I don't know let me know down below
you guys have this but you know how do
you explain it when your teeth like
shiver my mom gets it was like a long
stick if anyone gets a lottery ticket
like really affects NT some people get a
chalkboard
I'm getting it right now because this is
like the sound where it's soaked right
actually really hurts my teeth though
this side has gone nice and that your
line you know they're one of our button
that looks good
yeah so actually does okay now we're
going to blend it in now this is my
perfect idea obviously because a contour
brush is kind of a little bit more
thicker I'm thinking if I spread and put
the tampon like this I'm getting the
nice angles when trying to rub it in so
I've got it spread open I'm thinking
this could be the Hat so these are the
hair as much as well which is set up
quite good a lot more thing is they're
gonna pop the product make them I
personally bread as well but it doesn't
matter as much so that's a positive
thing okay I think the key is maybe just
to do it gently but on my hand may a
quite a bit after this video when I
contour my face as well always do
circular motion so I'm gonna try that
with my new flat
- just looking I love what I'm doing
right now
38 rennet I'm being serious while doing
this video and secondly this town
wanders like a platypus or like just
something weird from the sea it just
looks very abnormal so let me know down
below who you think this tampon looks
like for good but it doesn't like a
Kansan anymore it definitely looks
destroyed but let that contour but it's
good
the actually looks good surprisingly
four pins and needles I get every single
video and actually have so much ow
normalize so far we've gone through pain
you know is taking a bit longer there is
hoping but the overall look is is look
at half decent right now it's going
better than I expected to so now I'm
going to move on up with the blusher
right I'm going to get the new camp axe
from there it's open this bad boy up or
as we need one more actually pink are
going to nothing how how how sad you
know what I might he's going to open it
this bad boy up again just looks like
you know the bottom which I'm going to
do this as good as I can and don't like
the bottom goal very well so I'm kind of
gonna smooch this in if that's even a
word with the blush is picked up one to
the camp horn but whether it actually
can go on the face who knows okay out of
this column the face it's gone on the
face I did not expected to come out just
like that
Lily it does come out yeah I'm the local
in the camera now and I'm just thinking
how am I going to blend this in this is
the issue we're having I think we forego
the other side where it has a lot the
blush on in might know this guy's he
ruined it
guys we've got to save this pray for me
down below yeah new champ our new year
boy there was no rules - how many
tampons I could use so all those go on
I'm going to walk open another because
the highlight I normally use quite a
small brush from it so I'm kind of going
to tap it on the top of my cheek I'm
going to draw with this new look glow
say
my lighter that you got better than it
does of my Brock I don't know how I'm
gonna blend again it doesn't really want
to blend it's going on quite nicely but
it's a blend in partners an issue oh I
know it looks so cute like this this is
this time is really expanding I don't
know why but the pigment of it is
amazing right now and normally I view to
have a to the spot and it's really good
but like I never knew it was this good
so anybody that says I used too much
highlighter I proved you wrong because I
could be using this much I'm actually
now going to use the one that I use for
my blush I'm going to break this in half
oh it's like a dead what am i pregnant
after birth for your dead laughter
personnel I'm now going to go in with
eyes I'm going to use the like pinky
color tones I've got this Mac planet
here where I've kind of my brother of
the channel a little fluffy here I think
it would give up a couple to shimmery
bit I'm kind of going to dab it on here
and then dab it on my eyes obviously you
need to be a bit more careful with the
eyes because they're a bit more delicate
and I don't really want to be
exfoliating my eye sockets right now so
I think ah is that Jesus proceed
that has gone on my eye so perfectly I'm
actually just created a new trend that
is got a why I just died so my amazingly
oh my goodness Wow well this is actually
amazing on a third like I should be on
Jack and Sam right now creating the
tampon eyeshadow it's delicate it's easy
its quick it's all you want to brush
look how you know it's in this new hat
is clinical Bibles in it nobody actually
says it was but I've seen it everywhere
and it's kind of like where you to
string to print off your eyeliner so why
not use the tampon string so here's my a
like broken get half seal tampon thing
right I've got the string here I'm going
to paint the string this string scrap
stick okay beat envelope with dinner and
we
here getting a closer active camera I'm
realizing it's not as good as it is from
a distance but it's still pretty good
so I started by applying in the line
under my tampon I'm just going to apply
another one elk it's really hard to do
especially to try and do on the camera
right now I'm kind of struggling and but
where we get in there stick to I did get
something here
so this Oh mmm I'm just going to leave
up there for now
yeah it soaks up the project quite
quickly even on the strings it just
dries out well this is so hard I'm
actually also going to double up as a
mascara so as you can see I've got the
black from my well from my line out on
my tampon string and I'm not going to go
down and fill up with the mascara so
like it could be a good look so aren't
you so nervous for this it's a good
makeup look so I could go wrong what's
going to go down we get it ah yeah yeah
I don't know how it works from scar very
well maybe a little shimmy shimmy down
there right it was quite good there we
go oh my goodness patch is so good it's
kind of hard to get the angle down here
without looking very strange there we go
dab it up dab it up acapella buddy I out
what okay I'm actually so bright eyes
also actually looks like kind of good
weight right
I don't know how I sew up the lashes all
the way I'm missing the corner so I
think my hands going to have to get no
one messed any I'm going to put the
string down a kind of you know dab it in
the corner but you just need to be
capadoccia eyes up like I'm doing right
now it's really not wanting to go in
corner like the dab dab dab
Krissy you know what I really don't like
my liner doublethink haxing what so I'm
going to get my mascara put on at the
tampon the sticky side but again is
taking up a lot of the product so it's
really hard I'm dabbing it on as you can
see right now guys there's some of the
lower lashes oh this way you're going to
be actually careful you don't poke your
eyes out
I don't know that actually got any of my
lashes or I've just made black
underneath my eyes but it's definitely
making my lashes
my eyes fill up some so close to
finishing this look the final thing is
mystic now I picked a variety kind of
hot pink color somewhere and pink so I
can go quite nicely so I don't want to
you know I don't want to use so lowers
and those of those the temple and I'm
just going to go with open on youth
before I'm actually have to go with them
scar one it's the best one I've got
because clean it's on the top and I felt
like you know this one is another one it
needs to be on the top so again I'm
going to be getting it the liquid
lipstick just applying it on the top and
then yeah using it as stick I guess so
as you can see right now I'm applying it
to the top okay I'm gonna find this I'm
realizing it doesn't it releases like 10
bucks right now and I really didn't be
brush it so look like that is this
actually looks disgusting and I've said
that I thought all good apply this to my
lips give this one a shot off good
actually kind of makes me feel a bit
sick so you're my weed is everybody out
at this point as well but as I just tie
this jump onto my lips so oh oh I don't
know why though it's going on so well I
just feel so wrong doing this attached
is why good you know what this I mean I
had like good thoughts and how this
makeup look was going to go but I don't
think it was going to go this well I'm
actually I'm proud
