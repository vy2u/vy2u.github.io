things sitting on that chair is don't
get it away and scared already in as you
can tell I'm completely bare face and
look very pale but I think Jake's gonna
change that for me let's get stranger so

learned a few ways how to do makeup and
makeup look I'm gonna go for is a nice
new year new me love what I start with

liquid stuff or is so much fun these are
most fun icing on your face but not when

did happen you can't even make up so
once we've done our face there we then
move on to contour so we need our
chopstick which yes what is in there CJ
