guys are new hello to all of those who
have stuck around to an old school he
kind of like know the drill by now I
hope you guys are having a good day so
today's video is definitely relatable if
you guys are a Facebook user or a matter
of fact if you just use a lot of social
media now on a facebook they've started
to use a lot of like ads that just come
up right to be on your timeline which to
be honest I kind of like because
majority of them are clothing stores you
guys know how much I just love shopping
clothes however I've never ever ever
actually gone on to these clothes and
science and really seen what they
actually sell so I decided to go into
the first fight of clothing stores I saw
and decided to buy some clothes from
each one most of the clothes I bought
were under $10 I think there was maybe
like two different clip tune from like
items that was like under $15 but like
in pounds I think that's something like
twelve pounds it's still like pretty
affordable so I'm very excited because
honestly like these look so good like
for the value of money but in real life
like is it actually gonna be like that
like the reality of it I'm not entirely
sure hopefully fingers crossed that
would be literally amazing so I really
hope you guys do enjoy the video I'm
gonna get completely my honest review
and opinions with such a big thumbs up
you guys do and subscribe down below if
you guys haven't already and be sure to
subscribe as well because I'm gonna do a
lot more videos like there's kind of
like reviewing online foldable stores
like clothes and makeup and different
things you know so be sure to subscribe
and with that for Rodia let's get into
the video one thing I found from doing
this is that that majority of the stores
are the same things as each other
however the prices do vary so make sure
you guys do look around when you're
buying these items from the stores so
the five shop is wrong way I did
necessarily buy this in order but I'm
gonna show you what I bought the papers
so I got actually just trousers from
Olney I got robbed one day ramaa wrong
way right so the first thing I've got is
definitely arrest these are a pair of
boyfriend jeans I think boyfriend jeans
are hard to get from any store because
you kind of want them to be tight around
the waist but like loose on the leg
these
actually look really nice the back work
is definitely nicer than what I thought
it was gonna be
however they look absolutely flipping
huge
I don't know csoka boyfriend jeans if
they means that me and my boyfriend
could both get inside but they might be
deceiving you know if I tried them on
and they might be them I just fit
perfectly you know so let's give these
things so obviously I thought these were
going to be ugly actually cute but you
know what he definitely is deceiving and
then these are they definitely could be
like tighter and stuff around the waist
like it was pulled in there be like a
lot nicer but I actually do think these
are actually really cute and I tried on
so many different boyfriend jeans from
different stores and to be honest I
don't it needs that any worse than the
others I captured in this kind of
success quite like them I do notice that
I've bought these kind of like smart
joggers I wear all the time
I love getting these from places like
Barcia car I might pull embarr they do
amazing ones so but they still look
little bit different they've got an
elasticated waist mug it's quite quite
an applicative waist actually I would
keep talking I'm not too sure I've got
about these the fabric and not even just
the fabric they kind of just look like
men's pajama bottoms
so think these actually particularly
look like the picture just by the fabric
and stuff but again you never know I
could try them on and they could look
amazing so let's give it a go these are
the most uncomfy I'm just pulling it
like this and they've just split it and
there's so I'm gonna be honestly I don't
think I'm gonna give these a thumbs up I
would not want them out and they do
anything for my pajama bottoms
they look like it well they definitely
do feel like it like were there me
wearing this for two seconds this has
like split around it's also just like a
really uncomfortable and awesome they
just like super itchy as well right so
the very last pair of trousers that I
got from romwe
again I feel like this was like the
biggest risk like trouser I don't know
so these are very like honor trend
trousers they are so cute I love the
stripe going down the side I honestly
think it's so cool and I hope I bought
these thinking I wear it like a night
out or like a party or something that
honestly I don't know if you can tell on
the camera but it's into you like the
sweatshirt kind of like material I
thought would be more shiny but again it
might look great on these are I don't
want to put it down but these are awful
I wouldn't even wear these indoors for
comfort well they're quite comfy I think
this is one size and I think that's why
I bought them and you know this is not
good for one size because I'm very sure
and these are just kind of like neither
here or they're like they're like ankle
swingers but they're not long enough and
they're not short enough to be through
Portland
so what really are they you don't have
them made and you definitely got 3/4
length moving on and so the next site I
bought from a horse which I got to do I
got one top it like two different colors
because I love the top so much so I'm
gonna in gray and like a baby balloon so
this is the top first thoughts I think
it is super super super cute I'm gonna
look so cute in the summer there's also
only $3 and like I don't think I would
ever guess I like this is $3 however
looking at the embrace it kind of looks
like it's lifting up and it's like it's
just had like four stitches on air but
you do kind of get what you pay for so
obviously I completely understand that
plus like if your mom or you know
somebody that's like good luck with a
need you're good at stitching then they
can just stitches on Thea you know and
then it Joseph really quickly this is
the top in the blue style and all what
my goodness
I love it so much it's so cute it's like
so summery so I'm very excited to wear
this and I definitely think I will wear
their cycle when I'm away like in a hot
country this is what the blue top it's
like on I actually think is so cute
honestly like I would definitely wear
this out I think I would work like maybe
over a bikini or something just like
throw it on on holiday I think is that
you need yeah I really
likely I think it's definitely worth the
purchase three eight dollars I mean come
on
obviously the stitching isn't the best
but like it's super cute and I were to
go and buy it again we literally never
heard or seen this one before I think
it's a chic or sick chic how you
pronounce it I don't know let me know
down below because I think I'm
pronouncing this completely wrong but
this one I'm most excited for because I
would genuinely buy this from like a
cock like if I still is like in the
shops like from my store online
I would definitely want to go and fire
so pretty much is this okay not so cute
in real life but it was so cute online
so is this right I screamed rumpa right
honestly
obviously I'm leaving up the pictures of
what they look like online look at this
and look at this that is that is not the
same thing I'm sorry I did not pay for
that sure I know you'd give up you get
what you pay for but that that is really
bad like this bit looks so cheap here
and the fabric does feel absolutely
disgusting honestly you can get such a
chance for like affordable cheap prices
this fabric and I don't read till I put
it down up but like I can't I don't know
what it's called but you know that
backward when you're young going like
you cut it up as a kid that's what this
feels like like it actually is
disgusting not only does it look nothing
like the picture actually feels so gross
now this is just or Thor not gonna lie
I've just realized that it's actually
that fout material and you would have
wears out you know like what there's
like cheap father Christmas outfits a
minute off this is what this says okay
so it feels disgusting it also does not
sit very nicely and it's just not very
cute like it's one of those things you
walk past if you like what the hell is
that I'm a good believer of you get me
paid for but this isn't
sniffs out is from the shop called
either sheen shrine again I don't know
how to pronounce it so I've got this
kind of light and distressed jump
parents like a cropped jumper there's
actually if first thoughts and look at
the next I think this is actually so
nice honestly if this was in Topshop for
like 30 pounds or something I would
probably buy it like I actually love
this I love all the cuts on the sleeve I
think it's super cute it's very me it
looks really cozy the fabric actually
looks really good
this is what it kind of ready looks like
from the back it's I'm distressed at the
bottom yeah I think this is so nice
I'm so excited to try this on and I
think this might just be my favorite
thing yeah and to be honest is the only
one that looks like actually like the
picture like identical you know I love
this jumper I think it's so nice it's a
really really really good quality
actually I would work out which is
always a bonus the only thing is I
probably would size up just because I
like my thing as being a bit more
oversized but overall I do really like
the jumper this is what the back looks
like obviously it's like this dress at
the back I've already talked about full
of it okay so that's all I obviously I
think everybody's heard of that for the
online clothing store I own it a bunch
of stuff from their side and I've only
got one thing okay and this is one thing
that for me wasn't in this show but now
we're showing it because I have nothing
else to show you guys it's a pajama set
but it's not perfection shorts but this
is actually so pretty to be fair but
like where the heck is my other stuff I
have an idea cuz I think it's been over
20 days but this is what it looks like
and then this is what the shorts are
like are they almost super super super
cute and I don't think it's very
expensive I could do actually really
like this and I'm just kind of concerned
to amytal suffice I don't know if you
guys ever ordered from Zach or is it
going to turn up I have no idea so every
one of this is the lounge that I
completely forgot inside the Campania
heads what no makeup on right now clip
going this is a night time but this is
the lounge that is actually really
pretty but it's so flippin small now
this is a size
medium and I definitely wouldn't
consider myself a size large like in
pajamas and stuff but I would have to
have like an extra large in this and
it's so tight especially around my boobs
I have so close up you're gonna get this
but other than that is really nice so
I'm just looking at minutes I to machine
and I'm just thinking what the hell am I
ordered about I do remember ordering
this but you look so cute online so this
is like pink tassel like baby pink
hoodie and I like these I love pop our
bows I hope they say on life whatever so
cute because they used to sell one
really similar to this on the website
boo boo which is like really fucking
cute I'm just thinking what the hell is
this because it doesn't really look like
you I don't know it's just it looks a
bit too basic I don't know online it
just looks so much more it kind of like
is like what it looks like to be fair
but it just I don't I just expected it
to be cuter in real life it's just um
yeah just companies what it is actually
I completely take this back because I
have no this is like really cute long so
you can kind of might see the parts at
the quite obvious and yeah I think it
actually sits quite nicely it's actually
compared to like the other jumpers I've
tried on so far but yeah but hearts are
actually like really cute and and then
would last quite abundant actually how
many washes and it takes but definitely
I don't know it's like good value for
money
really yeah I do quite like this jumper
again I think before she would wearing
we also just found this at the bottom of
the Romney bag actually I didn't realize
that this is in there so this is like a
cropped yellow jumper that I got and I
do actually love this so much so it's
good like checkered sleeves and they
have this in so many different colors
and like this is kind of like my style I
love things like this I just love
checkered clothing so I think this is
actually super cute and I definitely
will wear it the fabric is really thin
and it does kind of look like somebody's
cut it themselves up with a pair of
scissors however I do actually still
think this is really cute and I would
wear it but I think I would have to wear
maybe like I don't know like a yellow
crop top or something underneath because
it is really really see-through and thin
everybody please excuse my hair because
honestly it's driving me insane every
single time that I get change it it
falls out
stealing was it's at the moment but this
jumper is pretty much why step like it
is really cute I do really like it
however as I said it is very sick
throughout the thing but again it is
kind of way to get what you pay for so I
would definitely wear something better I
believe I have a bright pink bar on
right now I maybe should keep out but I
do what everybody that is the end of the
video now I feel like I get a nice
comeback 5050 some of the suppers good I
don't know if that was by luck or not
however some of it didn't really look
like I expected it to it like I don't
know it's kind of like a 50-50 overall
I'm still obviously waiting for my is
Apple order and I did order this like
probably over 20 days ago now so I don't
know where the heck that is especially
because one of the items has turned up
and I didn't order quite a bit from
there like summer clothes and stuff so
I'm kind of gutted about that I
definitely will be contacting them and
obviously updating you guys over on my
vlog in channel if you don't subscribe
you should uh-huh
but yeah like the other stores came in
like decent amount of talent wrong we
actually came over really surprisingly
quick so I was very happy about that and
but yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed
the video I hope it was helpful and
useful to you I will leave the clothes
down below if you guys to go and check
out thank you so so much for watching I
hope you'll get to see you guys very
