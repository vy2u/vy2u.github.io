now for today's video I'm gonna be doing
a huge Highmark call and I wanna say
huge I literally mean I have to a
gigantic bags and love to say that I
felt so embarrassed when I had to walk
out with two huge bags and also when I
was like paying at the chores okay this
is so embarrassing
I have so much but it's gonna be broke
for you guys and I'm so happy with my
purchases so it's all good but I do have
so much as I said so I'm gonna try and
talk through everything as quick as I
can I do just want to say that is a huge
mix of absolutely everything from my
home words of pajamas to clothes - what
there's just so many given things so
have you guys do enjoy and I thought I
could definitely do enjoyed this video
so I love filming them and I just don't
even though you drew them enough so if
you guys do enjoy some of these smash a
big thumbs up and subscribe down below
to let me know oh good girl that right
that was really pretty that doodriver so
anyways I hope you guys do enjoy the
video and let's get into it
right okay where to start guys so this
is actually one of the last things I
bought because I saw these hang it up
and I was like yes I need those I can
tell straight away by the packaging
because honestly I'm one of those people
what if the package ends and eyes I'm
like yeah I'm gonna get it anyway so I
love the packaging I love the marble
love the pink also the headphones are so
nice these were eight pounds and they
kind of like that dusky and you know
kind of it's like rose gold but then
it's more of like a pinky rose gold and
they're also green silver they're really
nice headphones because they have a lot
of padding as well which I just thought
were really nice because they're going
to be really comfortable I do actually
own like a really nice pair of like
expensive headphones however the ones
that I have a wireless so you have to
charge them and I have the worst memory
ever and I always forget to charge them
so I thought this would be a great
cheaper option for when I forget my
headphones and also this solid green
nice so that was the first thing that I
did pick up next up is something
completely different but I couldn't
resist because I just feel like you can
never really have enough pajamas and it
is getting into winter time now so I
picked up these pajamas which are so
cute if you love sloths you're gonna be
like dying inside right now so these are
these sloths pajamas it came as a
so these are the bottoms my favorite
thing about them is actually the
waistband at the top of the waistband at
the bottom I just think these are like
the comp es type of pajamas so I love
these and it was 10 pounds for the set
and then this is what the top looks like
and it says so sleepy I could sleep all
day and I just thought they were so cute
and they look really cozy and soft as
well so that's why I picked up those and
then I picked up these cozy socks just
because otherwise these are the best
cozy socks if you're looking for some
snuggly socks definitely go to Primark
because they're only 1.80 as well I got
this jumper which I thought was really
cute and it is gray is quite thick
it looks quite snugly again I thought
again it'll be great like now autumn is
coming up in the winter so it's just a
great jump it looks kind of thing but I
just feel like it's gonna be one of
those when you actually put it on it's
always gonna look good and it's gonna
look nicer on it also has this cross
detailing at the back as well which it
just thought was really pretty but not
too much so it's just kind of one of
those ones which I can just throw em
whatever and it will always look and
feel really nice this is something I
probably do not need but I did want to
get and I just thought even am i doing
really use it I can just put it on my
desk and it would just look really nice
so it's this marble journal I just
thought it looked so pretty it's really
thick as well and it was very affordable
but it was only four pounds and as you
guys can tell by my bedding I literally
am obsessed with anything marble so I
had to pick this up and inside is pretty
cool as box it has like to do lists and
notes and lots of other things as well
so yeah I thought this was really cute
really pretty and I got one really
similar to this from Urban Outfitters at
the beginning of the year and it cost me
about 15 pounds so I bought like that's
less than half the price so I'm
definitely gonna get my hands on this is
definitely for coming into autumn so it
says a monochromatic and white checkered
skirt I just brought it it's really cute
is something I would definitely wear I
love wearing skirts because they are so
coffee and also this one's elasticated
as well so you know if it's going to
winter and you're eating a bit too much
then this one's gonna be great for you
guys but it was eight pounds I just
looked is really pretty kind of
nice anything like that feel like you
could really make a layer this art way
like I said jumper over top or you could
wear pretty much anything like trainers
whatever ready so yeah I just thought
this was really cute and it's something
I would definitely wear and I can
imagine myself wearing this a lot to be
honest so if you do these diffusers
which was so flippin cheap they were a
pound like a pound and they smell really
really good I spot them in the store you
can't really smell them and they put the
packaging on but I did spend it in the
store this fall so nice this one is
vanilla and this one is sea salt and
lavender I thought my mom is actually
going to love this I kind of thought
like if they don't really do that much
and they don't smell that strong then I
just thought why I don't really miss out
on anything because it's only a pound
each anyways and yeah they were that's
it really
they were they were just really nice so
they were appalling so I had to pick
them up I'm sure you guys watch my blog
said you will see if I like them or ever
because I'm gonna put them in my room
today and just just back so again if you
follow in my vlogs and you will actually
know that I'm obsessed with Brian
underwear from primer after having to
buy a new bra from Victoria's Secret
every single week and my bankers are
really liking it I thought okay we're
gonna move to Primark and you know what
that under way is so nice and so comfy
whether this bra is a really like a
padded comfortable bra it's not very
supportive it's more on the decorative
side but it's so pretty and I also
thought it'd be really nice as well if
you have something sheer on as well and
if you don't want padding in your bra
then this one's gonna be perfect I do
also have it of white as well
I just thought it was so nice I love the
kind of like a flower lace detailing at
the front I've also okay to say it's
really really really comfy as well so
that's what the back looks like and this
was eight pounds and then I did get the
unica's to match but I don't know where
they are now but pretty much the same
thing no I've every think I'm gonna ever
wear this on like actually done off
however I bought this checkered shirt
would look really cool either Tober of
my ways or if I had it on like done up
top underneath I thought this would also
look really nice so it's a buttoned
checkered shirt and you guys know I'm
really in love with red as well
so since there were so much red I
thought maybe even were just wore
somewhat like a white best slob I could
really jazz it up with this just higher
on my waist
even have an honor but just done open I
thought it would be really cool this was
9 pounds and I used to have one but I do
have one really similar to this and I've
had it for about five years now
so I thought I would you know go and
actually buy myself a new one because
because it's game quite old now and I
just thought it was really cool so yeah
got this checkered shirt and then
something similar to this I did I don't
actually know what this is gonna look
like on it's one of those I think would
look really nice and really cool or
could just told me no so this is one
thing I haven't tried on its a checkered
shirt dress and I just thought with like
black longji hypos it could look really
cool or just high boots in general so
this is what it looks like it's a hockey
green and it's that black or navy it's
kind of like in the middle of the tube
I'm not sure about the fabric though
because it is quite thin so I'm not sure
what its gonna feel like I mean it does
so can't be but don't know what its
gonna look like on so again I will
update you guys on this I thought you
could look really cool and I think this
was about 910 pounds as well so yeah
that I think this dress as well it's one
of those like if it's too long it's not
gonna look good
however I did hold it up myself and it
did seem like quite a good length so
fingers crossed guys I'm really hoping
that does look good because I'm going on
tour soon absolute buzzing and I think
this could be one of my outfit so very
excited and then I also this is the
second time I buy this now I don't
really know why because mine is a key
skill lasting I go in fact my whole
family goes through iPhone charges like
no other and I'm genuinely not joking we
like steal each other's and we lose each
other's and we break each other's and
nobody ever has a charger and I'm just
so sick buying really expensive Apple
chargers from Apple when the other
charges work and last meet just as long
so I bought this not too long ago from
Primark is this a rose of gold charger
again look how pretty the packaging is
it was only four pounds okay and it's
love
me just as long as a Apple charger has
and I just thought like may as well get
it again
it also can charge as well as an iPhone
it can charge like my camera at the same
time as well which is a really flippin
call so even though other one hasn't
broken yet I'm just gonna have this one
as a backup for what it does or for when
somebody in my house decides to Nick my
charger well I'm gonna have a backup one
so that's actually why I grabbed this
because I hate not having a phone
charger it is so frustrating this jumper
I really love and I think it looks a
little more expensive than it is so this
was 10 pounds and it's gray it's really
comfy it's kind of like a thin at cotta
material and it has cutout shoulders as
well so I thought like if I have a ton
of something this would look really nice
behind I see I mean it's a jumper so who
really don't over time that's still
gonna look good but yeah there's not
really much to say about it again it's
just really thin and cotton but I
thought it looks a little bit more
expensive than it is and it's so
comfortable on so that's why I picked up
this I really don't want to rush some
out of the way however now autumns kind
of coming I really want to get in the
mood you know the Knights are drawing in
so I really couldn't resist so I picked
out this hour water bottle it is so
flippin cute or even a massive found
hours to be honest however this I just
thought was like different different
breed of our guys is so cute I can also
not the but that you can hang this my
goodness you can also hang it up as well
it's also it's so cozy so I cannot wait
to actually have an excuse so I can
actually use this and it was only six
pounds as well
and when I say soft it is like so so
soft
I could literally like kind of up to
this at nighttime again you can only say
you can't really have enough water
bottles
just like pajamas I could buy so so many
and still not have enough I also got
these pajamas they are so cute they are
very different to the last job as I
bought again this is a pajama set so
these are the shorts this is when it's a
little bit hotter and they are grayed
suede and they have so soft and really
cozy I love them so much and this is
what the shorts in life
that also it comes under set and this is
the camee desktop that it comes up again
it's some cozy and I just thought this
was really really really pretty this set
was 10 pounds as well when I show my
money she was like okay I won those
right now literally they are so nice and
it'll do a little bit more grown-up the
other ones I feel like you know cozy hot
chocolate when you're kind of like home
alone you know if you just want to look
you impress your friends or impress them
but I just bought these of really nice
and when I say this off they have
literally like cuz straight these all
day I then also there's a ton of at the
boring part I picked up some pops off
but I think I picked up the little pop
songs because they all my favorite
things ever and again so everyone there
was everything from my primer cool today
I thought like I bought so much more at
the time maybe I didn't I don't know but
