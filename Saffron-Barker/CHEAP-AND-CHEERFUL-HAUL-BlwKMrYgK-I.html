everyone and I never like to admit that
I was wrong and I've been so caught up
in my job okay so the fashion I went to
was a new look now I'm already a family
lokai nobody go in there I was looking
for Christmas jumpers so I went
everywhere searching for them and I
didn't fall on the ice so I definitely
will be going back something to try and
find mr. Ciampa but while I was in new
look I saw this punk pillow that I
absolutely love now I love this because
I love unicorns and I love past I always
he just thought it was the cutest thing
and it says at the top of that I wish I
was in uniform which is the neck to me I
wish I was a year on so so badly so I've
been a number there it's quite a small
pillow it's not too big and it was only
$7.99 so really I thought as a bargain
and this was a in love also they have
knows more like Unicom pub things like
they have wrapping paper and a mark I
believe and those are different things
that are also really really cute so that
would also be like a few Christmas idea
then that from new look I went and got
this unicorn black board now this is
definitely not needed and I've never
used a black board in my life probably
because I've never owned one but I have
to get this because it's the hugest
thing ever but you could just hang up I
think I'm gonna hang this up on this
wall so you'll probably see this really
really soon I just love these sparkle it
has on the top and I just think it's the
cutest thing and because I'm obsessed
with unicorns and I love the unicorn
emoji I just think
thank you I took oulous I probably will
be using it quite a lot because there
and I thought was ever I have to use it
now that I bought it and this is the
same price as a pillow this was seven
months also on my last shopping trip
I've got this cute beanie that I'm
wearing right now I thought oh boy it
rather than just show you guys it as it
seems you have to see what kind of like
15 years and this is only three of
pounds from Primark this is probably the
cheapest beating I've ever brought in my
whole life
and it's really really good fit as well
and I just love the ball so much to say
this is a bargain and loads of you have
been asking at my previous blog which is
when I was wearing a gray bubble beanie
with like a white woman at the top and
that was from Topshop and that was about
15 pounds and this was three pounds so
really I thought this is a bargain and I
just love it
I will be wearing it so much especially
as beanies a really really good one I'm
chilly as I know they only do it in this
color but they may do some other colors
as well and if they do I'm definitely
going to go and purchase another because
the fitting is amazing it's so cheap and
it's really really crazy then from
Primark actually working to Primark
looking for Christmas PJs because
they're always - really cute ones and
they're never too expensive as well and
I bought these red ones that have ranges
on little love hearts of smooth basic
all different just likes patterns in
white and I just love to but it has its
the top as well and it has lace all at
the top and even has lace at the bottom
and these were only six pounds for these
people expenses as well and I just love
them so so much and they're like a tight
fit in it's kind of like a legging feel
like it's a really really tight pajamas
he just wears like a vest top probably
pretty really comfy as well before this
day ends I really pumped in and everyone
I know absolutely loves leggings I mean
who doesn't think Lincoln
come on they are so comfy so these I
absolutely love and I probably will just
be aware of my public my stuff okay and
then from primark I have to get these
tweezers just because they are so cute
there are emoji tweezers and if you know
me you'll know that I can't tweet or
text or do anything without putting
emoji at the end so I had to get these
four because these are so kind
I also industries as well and these are
what these look like so this is like a
mint green color and a pink color and
and also i got these gift tags that were
only a pound so I thought why not as I
love emojis and I love movies and I love
emojis so much I just bought these for
no reason I just thought they were
really really cute then I went to Tiger
pacifically looking for these mason jars
and when I found them I was so happy I
had to go the whole way around the shop
and it was a very last place I went to
and I was so happy to find these these
are really cute because they're just
really Christmassy I just got the red oh
man I just think that bread love hearts
pretty clear and these are only two
pounds and these are in love and it's
definitely going to permit Instagram on
the weekend I was so so lucky because
lush has sent me a whole range of fire
forms and bubble bars and it wasn't
literally the best day and absolutely
love everything in life so it was like
heaven when I got this box at my house
and my two favorites which I'm going to
show you today is this bubble bar from
lush right now this is a cover
elliptical secret Sandra
hopefully next me well it's that yeah
this is a this is piece of Santa and I
just think this is so adorable it smells
amazing and this whole group and folio
right now smells incredible it smells
like I'm actually in the last shop so I
probably won't be using this because
it's so cute that I can't actually allow
myself to use this when January comes
and I think it is time to use it as
Christmas will be over I'm really really
sad me but all the time that is
Christmas and I'm in the Christmas
spirit
I would not be using this I'll just be
happy almost like it smells amazing then
the second bubble bar from lush is this
star line now this is one of my favorite
things in lush this is just so so pretty
I love the gold glitter on it and the
bow and the bow basically everything if
I could design that last bubble bar or
bath bomb I think it would look exactly
like this I think this is just amazing
and it's called that like Owlman doing
cinnamons now I absolutely love at the
Christmas time so this is amazing and
it's reusable as well so I can just like
dip it and squish it around my bar but I
feel like it I'd yeah I don't think it's
amazing what surprise I absolutely love
this is where everything our fly ball
okay so it's lights on the cheapy
cheerful stuff that I do love this is
going a bit more upmarket and this is
the Gwen Stefani palette from Urban
Decay and oh my goodness I was just
about to fell in love but I'm not gonna
say that I'm trying to deliver word oh
I'm in love I love this so so much and I
was all over the moon to get is because
it
come out yet it doesn't come out - I
think December time the kind is in here
are beautiful and they have 15 different
colors and they have those different
variety of colors so like at the bottom
they're like really extreme bright
colors and at the top it has more of a
simple everyday colors and today I'm
actually wearing I think four of these
colors so the colors that I've been
wearing today is this one here the
blonde zone and pop I haven't actually
been able to use this too much yet
because I've only had it two days but it
is one my favorite things and I think
I'll be using basically every color in
this palette maybe not the blue one just
because well I've never really tried
beautiful I definitely will try it out
and see look up and create but I'm not
too sure of it receive me that yeah and
also I just in love the packaging of
this I just think the gold is so nice
it's kind of like a mirror effect
because you can see yourself in it as
well and I just think it's so so
beautiful and then since I got the
palette from Urban Decay I thought I
really really need it this is the one I
really really needed a eyeshadow primer
now I haven't actually used potion a
primer before any brand never ever ever
used it below as my friends have really
recommended them to me and I thought
what about that Urban Decay's one I've
just put the new palette from Urban
Decay so I will show you what this looks
like if I can open it can how much Jesus
yeah I definitely will use it next I've
got my eye shadow it's quite a nice size
I can't actually remember how much it
was I'm going to sorry about that but I
won't link it in the description below
and I will also let you know if it's
good as well and then the last but not
least also from Urban Decay I got this
matte lipstick and now basically every
lipstick a day is mad because I just
really really prefer it on my lips and
this is like a dark red color I think
this color is so each all the Reds that
I have at home I'm really really bright
around
in the middle that's not she's right I
just thought this was so beautiful and
it's the perfect color so I really hope
