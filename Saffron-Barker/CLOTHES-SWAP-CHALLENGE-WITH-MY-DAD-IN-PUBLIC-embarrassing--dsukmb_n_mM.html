but not looking at you
[Laughter]
as we can which is yo I feel like it's
really not a very diverse City I mean
when we went into that coffee shop
though that people did give us dirty
looks but you know walking here I feel
kind of furry ready
[Laughter]
okay now we're getting closer to town I
thought American couple are you walking
with it was that type nice is so dumb
yes even she's not gonna talk to it's so
that night it is kind of a song you do
not hide yourself wearing it I think
that kind of skin type
so that our self-control
from there right and then get to a big
booth
for hours the end of the video I can't
believe how it wasn't even that it was
like embarrassing I just felt really
uncomfortable because I got it where we
did it we did it yeah I feel proud that
we did it but I drew it in a funny way
not good why yeah I've quite enjoyed it
because it was just different quite
enjoyed it we're not dressing up video
clothes on this thing but just not
caring what other people think that's
what you need to have that mindset like
I don't even normally cow other people
thing I think it's just cuz I felt
really uncomfortable and what I was
wearing what do you think who wore it
the best yeah yeah but in the polls and
let us know down below who wore it the
best and who also done the best job
