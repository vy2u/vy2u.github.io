know you lifting on look how dad's doing
this come here to just get this on
professional person is they so how you
doing it just placing it and pushing it
down try to mold it on after how are you
actually gonna get the pig shaped nose
this is why I don't understand don't
worry about it you can even build in but

I literally like a wit like it was out
he was like this big point thing I'm
sorry say to my dad I meant to be a pig
no wait we are they didn't look a rhino
and now I don't even know what it's like
and I'm very breathe
to be fair I can't breathe I just say
like ah show me that nothing like a pig
I don't and he's been doing this for
like an hour now because IG depressing
what do I do for you guys I swear what
you're doing now
scopa turn yet wanna kiss you because
they have massive nostrils I told you
call this I would call this integrity oh
hey girl so you guys want to do this
tutorial you know it today mom suggested
a knife once you get nice and cut me
with a right now not be good suggestion
I'm gonna use annoys the growth is
definitely better right side this is the
current situation is a little better
it's the iPad
yeah it's all right now but like the
side view I'm gonna throw I'm gonna see
what can stick that there do using
liquid latex right not just sticking
with oh hi sickness berry gum no I'll
chew this on Shuman isn't it liquid yeah
we're doing it anyway oh oh so cool
pretty much just stick on your own that
was good positioning and by the way my
dad use all of that one you just wanted
to use all right so we're just like
sticking this on this doesn't really
cool with the pecos mover are you taking
them an hour I'm kidding oh you guys are
lucky though I'm gonna edit a silly
sound good in mind because I'm actually
do you sure this is what you use to
stick it on my skin is so bad
so breathing that feels like that
stopped up it stuck pretty well I don't
know how it's not working the glue it's
not stick now is stuck now is it it's
completely stuck on okay alright well it
now it's sticking just takes a lot
longer than I imagined it to work I
think what I don't it before I did you
put it on with him it used on the neck
fallen yeah stage so complete getting
zippy now we have liquid latex
hopefully that's thick that is it round
our face a little bit more liquid latex
is actually so good you haven't use it
it's so easy as well never use this
before oh did you buy this liquid like
that no dad that's like out of date
no oh are you sure there's none that I
have like a year ago that just cost me
five quit hold on wait don't go why I
can't even get it to stick to my home
sure that's one you just bought just
brew it
I would imagine so give these who like
because later he's all comfy I don't
know what's happened my dad is not happy
and somehow it's my fault right so now
I've got a little bit he's liquid latex
not much just a little bit well probably
not gonna get much on this so anyway he
stormed out the room as it was my fault
that he's he's liquidating is that he
decided to buy money hey no why the one
I got was definitely no good I like to
go dancing after this pigs in about 40
minutes the liquid latex is going caught
on why don't you hit them I don't if you
do this is so long is like so sad what
I'm gonna try and do now it's been quite
hard cuz I've never done it before so I
am trying so we're gonna put like a
lighter foundation this is Seth ones
saying that it's a foundation a layer on
the outside and keep this bit so this is
a different color from this and we're
gonna make this a bit gory and it
supposed to put on your eyebrows or not
no ever see me this genuinely feels so
gross on my face like I can't even tell
you this why did you put it here in here
oh don't worry kinda hurts so much that
was a lot move we have to move now
no right so that's the last of that and
then we're gonna I should have her going
for the eyeshadow yes so we've got
Gwen Stefani college is because dad
wanted a black eyeshadow and this is
like the blackest I should have I owe
this called black out
so this is gourmet palette but this is
the black we've got to be using I
actually can't believe it myself in the
internet looking like this okay
yeah actually like tiny brush is the
eyeliner on your eyes because the
project isn't big enough you to use an
eyeshadow brush which is over here
thinking that it's looking quite good
now lately change so she looks like
she's a spray even more is it gonna be
like spray on cradled alright lost my
blood that say that okay he's got many
that's supposed to be moving gonna be is
like this could be so good fit it isn't
like the nose and the zip is really good
it just wishes the black eyes just look
at my can your mouth shut right guys
it's time to actually look in the mirror
now and then I'd add to that honestly
honestly there's enough there's enough
right okay his Almighty it's well you
know the nose and stuff actually looks
so good I just don't know about the
black eye and I think maybe that's
ruined air
everything went to the side looks inside
you looking good on the front now we've
just put your hair in bunches yeah even
on the internet like they're talking too
much this is taken two and a half hours
so it must be half decent I don't call
wait to wash it all off so everyone at
the end of the video I really hope you

things I've ever done in my entire life
