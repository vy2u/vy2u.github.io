prom out there for $25 what I could say
is good luck like nothing we're the ones
that should be now yeah I do know who's
gonna win I am NOT nervous whatsoever I
have to know like I won the other
challenge of one bet if I were the magic
in when the other challenge if I change
it half because even if mumbles and I so
like yours could look worse in real life

gonna win half a wine bottle nicer or
nearby and in real life well we don't
