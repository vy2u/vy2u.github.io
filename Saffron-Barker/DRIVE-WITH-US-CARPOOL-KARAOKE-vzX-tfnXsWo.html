gotta go to London

simply cannot have some by Murray but
they just haven't got back to me so I
don't honestly see such a long time very
amazed oldest work because allow me to
pick you up now yeah that's fine we're
coming
yeah oh my lady I'm just always running
right to be fat you are always fun at
night
welcome to my channel so I thought today
will be fun to have these guys join me
introduce yourself
I'll go first and we thought we'd do it
drive with me because this is like so
highly requested on my channel and we
just have gossip in and we love carpool
karaoke obviously the beginning of this
video is a bit of a joke but we thought
it'd be fun to play around and we we
basically tweeted saying that we are so
for questions and topics and stuff and
you guys have been you guys have
basically asked us to answer them and so
we're going to do that was to in Anna's
very favorite McDonald's but also before
we do our get into the drive with me you
can go and check out all of these guys I
lose but let's go let's get those
pickles I really used to work on my
dolls for literally and the two people
in like one in the first the person in
the first pill from the person is second
boob have got headsets on no only can
they talk to the people outside and take
people's orders but they can talk to
each other so me and my friends would
open ourselves quite bad would life's
like the customer off or we threw a ruby
black on my garbage
I feel like someone definitely done that
to us every time I went to McDonald's
for the past god knows how long
they never ever had your order on time
and every time you have to park up and
me and parking don't do well you know
who's talking earlier about who causes
the most drama in the group but it's so
funny because I bet the comments would
be so different what we are those phone
you everyone else know down below so
actually say it was really a bad week
right though yes your name and like with
you as well we literally do nothing but
and we get like people I don't know
people just bring our names yeah they've
got really nothing to back it up with
yeah I'm not involved in drama like I
try to stay out of it so I know will
come up to me oh did you hear what did I
just said or have you heard this rumor
and I might no no I don't wanna know
that information when you see a roof
light you hear a rumor about yourself
you're like I know what would you say
the biggest like all the most like fake
a rumor that you've ever had on the
internet why you but it's a rumor it's
not true about me unless your minds I
use my ex-boyfriends well that's also
not true
hey mom is it Morgan oh my god I know on
a bike pulled up a lot oh my god are you
Morgan's ex-girlfriend no sir
yeah
yeah I feel like if you could to be a
youtuber like in an instant every day
right you can go first
me yeah cause you thought about it oh
okay
me personally I'm gonna say willingly
because his personality is quite
incredible he's really funny and I
choose prints on it
[Laughter]
okay about somebody from a band oh my
god I already know much hair myself
where hey listen to him right now yeah
okay
nice choice the hand yeah are we all
just going to share the bounced out on
ya I love all of those voices so nice I
can see you with when you do that laughs
yeah you're gonna say no first I could
at first
yeah I'll say who though yeah yeah is
that funny cuz everyone like would have
with like a group of guys I wouldn't
just in some things were dating them and
they start shipping us together on
Twitter a lot oh my god yeah that's a
person does that ever make it awkward
between you in the person not really
like anything so no I don't think sorry
part of me I don't think it can unless
it they don't handle it as well as we
can yeah like to us we just kind of
scraped past it I think it's funny yeah
sure parts and I actually I am quite
pointed out I look at that and if
they're like yeah I think all because
they have a girlfriend or like down low
or something then it's all good I saw
quite a bit or bad yeah me too yeah
heard about the cost of a con it's
really good actor told you which is the
what tell me what's wrong tell me what
needs a little better better is the
perfect recipe
I feel like none of us personally like
actually ever like I know we spoke about
causing it earlier but I do feel like I
mean it like that though yeah we don't
mean that I don't like none I haven't
ever any of you just ran a me snug
someone off like any of you did I think
I would just say I don't wanna hear it I
just yeah and also I think you've got to
be whooping sad that my mom treated the
other day look so good you have to
listen to how some people speak popovers
because they might talk about you in
YouTube I feel like everyone just thinks
I know obviously people only hear in our
side to the story but like I've never
heard any of us just rad to me start
talking because we just don't want to
waste our time on the toilet or other
things
yeah then we just spend our time just
making movies jokes likeable weird
noises yeah where everyone on that note
