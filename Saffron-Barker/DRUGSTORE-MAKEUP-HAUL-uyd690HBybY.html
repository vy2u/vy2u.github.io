welcome back to my channel so today I'm
going to be doing a drugstore makeup
haul this is very unintentional as I
hadn't planned on buying this much
makeup I was literally in town for like
an hour and I managed to buy so much
everything that I bought was either
recommended by friends or like just a
title on other people's youtubes and I
just think looks so good and I can't
wait to try them although I have tried a
lot on my face today and so I have got a
few products that I'm wearing today and
I will let you know which ones I am
wearing already and also every product
that I'm showing you today I'm gonna do
a makeup look for you guys that's it
like in a couple of weeks time just
because you guys keep asking me for
makeup loads and I just think and it's
all like very cheap from be smooth price
why don't do a makeup look on it and
also as well I'm gonna go in order
because I bought the whole face like you
could do a whole makeup look with the
bonus I bought today I'm gonna try and
do it in order of how I would apply it
to my face anyway let's get straight
into the video the first thing I went
and bought and I would apply to my face
is this concealer and it's the instant
anti age the eye
Arisa by maybelline and it is amazing no
i have been recommended this by so many
friends and different youtubers I've
Watsa said it's amazing and I completely
agree with them and to be honest I never
normally wear concealer it's just a
thing I just thought like what's the
point I could just cover up with
foundation but it's amazing at covering
up redness on my spot and I would
definitely be adding this to my everyday
makeup routine now I can't believe I
haven't gone and bought it before if I'm
honest and also what's amazing about it
as well is the sponge that it has so
good because you can just dab it on your
face anywhere and it just covers up all
redness and all spots and it's so worth
the money and this was $7.99 so the next
product I bought was by Kiko and this is
the 3d lifting
Foundation and can I just say it's
amazing at coverage I use this once
yesterday to try it out because when I
get new makeup I have to instantly try
it because I can't just having it
sitting there and I can't just not
easier so I tried this and it's really
really good it is quite low E it's a
very very natural looking foundation
although it is high coverage and it
feels really really nice on your skin
and one thing that I think is really
great about this as well is it so easy
to put on and a reason I don't normally
use liquid foundation is because I do
find them hard to put on I just put this
on with my fingers and it goes on so so
easy the next product is from Superdrug
and this is the revolution bronzer and
OMG this is so so so so good it gives so
much warmth to your skin and whenever
I'm wearing it whatever makeup look I
have I will always put this on my face
no matter where I'm going what I'm doing
what makeup and wearing I will always
use this and I think it's like six or
seven pounds I can't remember is that
plate I'm gonna like I didn't actually
buy this yesterday but this is the one
product I did want to include because
everything that I'm buying is drugstore
and I thought was a bit happy to be
included because it's so so good and it
literally lasts forever
so the next product also from Kiko again
and this is the lip scrub no recently
I've been getting really dry lips and so
I've been using a lot of fastening but I
do know myself that lipstick rabbits
better and I did have one a long time
ago from lush that was amazing and
tastes amazing
'icarly remember how much this was but I
know it wasn't a lot I'll put the link
in the description below if you want to
go check it out but this is what it
looks like in this I can average
lipstick it's really really pretty I
think and it's it smells amazing
massagers and it's really good that it's
like an exfoliator full on it basically
when you put this on your lips it
basically just exfoliates and just gets
my all the dry skin I made your lips
feel so much moving just put on there
together and you're sorted yeah I can't
wait to try this also plus line it
smells amazing
I bought two new palettes I brought one
from Superdrug I think this is
collection and this one is key
and there are very very similar colors
but I'm going to talk you through them
both individually this palette has six
different colors and they're all very
neutral colors and they're very matte as
well I brought this palette a couple of
days ago and all the colors are very
very nice on your eyes but they're not
very pigmented and they don't last very
long
which is one thing that I do disliked by
this palette although a form like I
think it was like 12 pounds I think it
still is worth the money although when I
stood the next palette I do definitely
prefer that planet and that planet was
$2.99 so so here it is the barking of
the day this also has six colors also
very neutral colors and these colors are
very pigmented and it has more of a
range of colors although it's still very
neutral colors you've still got more
maroon to there so if I just rub the
colors on my fingers then you'll realize
how well they are pigmented and they're
really really nice colors and they do
come up is that Pete how they show on
the palette and sometimes when I buy
cheap palettes especially because this
is $2.99 you think he doesn't come out
the color that actually is but it comes
out so strong and it's really
long-lasting and it's just amazing I is
so good that if I'm comparing this light
to a naked palette I personally think
it's just as good and it's $2.99 and
when you put this on in the morning
because it's so thick it will last you
all day and all night like it will not
come off at all and yes the colors are
really thick and I was going to say it's
really worth the money but it's so cheap
that it's obviously worth the money and
so yeah I definitely recommend this
palette you're going into super drug and
you're looking for a new palette
definitely go pick this one also the
rest of this range as well is supposed
to be really good my friend has the
contour palette which I regret not
getting now after I've use this because
it is so good and but when she uses it
it looks amazing on her skin
I do really regret not buying it and I
think I will have to pick it up soon so
then I picked up this Rimmel eyeliner
and this is also supposed to be so good
I think it was like four pounds but
what's the most be so good about it is
obviously it looks like a foul tip pen
it hasn't got the point that a normal
foul tip eyeliners have it has like a
square edge on it and so it's easier to
use and so this would define the shape
as you could have it like the pointy end
like you would any other eyeliner but if
you don't want to twist it round so you
have the sharp beside it's so easy to
use and to give you that shape that you
want I need two new mascara and I tend
to use a lot of different mascaras like
there's not one that I just particularly
love and so my brother's girlfriend
Nicole she said this is her favorite one
ever and she always seems to get amazing
products so this is the one by Bourjois
and it's nice packaging it's just very
simple but the brush itself looks really
really nice I haven't actually opened it
yet but when I saw it in this drop it
did look really nice and it is meant to
give you really really thick eyelashes
which is what I tend to love so
hopefully it will be as good as its
supposed to be then to finish up the
eyes to realize I don't normally wear
false eyelashes that much and maybe now
and then if I'm going out or if I'm
filming as very special video and who I
might be wearing them now just because I
don't particularly wear than that much
these are the Kimberley Walsh ones I've
got this from super drug I think there
were five pound fifty roughly a 559 or
something like that
and what I liked about these these were
very natural-looking although what I do
tend to like about eyelashes are the
ones that come thicker and longer on the
outside as I just think it gives you
such a nicer effect then to have it all
the same length and if they're longer at
the side of your eyes and this is what
these doo-doo-doo-doo each of these do
do although they are very natural
looking at the same time okay so finally
I'm going to finish off the lips and I
think I got five different products for
these and it the first products I'm
going to show you I have wanted for a
very long time I can't remember who's
YouTube video watch where they had these
and I tried to live so long and I still
can't remember now but I'm so glad to
have them especially because I looked
online and they were sold out everywhere
the only place they said they wasn't
sold out with food so that I tried to
order them from online and they weren't
sold out but then I went but I didn't
want to throw it out so it's been cool
so these are all from L'Oreal and as you
can tell I've got three shades the fur
trade I got with JLo nude and this is
the one
I want to bother any and I've tried this
one out before and it is really really
nice Naomi's the final show I got was
Julian's here red and this is the color
that I'm wearing right now and it's a
very bright red although it has got like
a pinky shade in it which is what I love
about it because normally I wear lady
danger by Mac which is so bright red and
which I absolutely love but this one's
got more of a pinky tone in it and it's
so nice this is what the JLo nude looks
like wife respond it reminded me of
velvet teddy which is where I loved it
so much
although when it's on your lips it's a
lot lighter than Bauer today it's more
like myth or honey laughs but once again
it is still really really nice and then
this one I didn't actually choose as one
because my mom and Nicole went and got
this for me because I asked them to
because I was too busy in another shop
and they picked this one up and this was
the Naomi's one and this color is
absolutely beautiful it's like a pinky
orange color these lipsticks very very
matte and I love this color a lot it's
in the nude collection with JLo also and
yeah I do love it a lot although
personally I don't think you can be a
matte lipstick like these are all so
good especially when these look graceful
too so I think it came to 14 pounds as a
$6.99 each so if you don't want you to
spend as much money then these are
really nice lipsticks although I think
for the extra money definitely go and
pick yourself up a matte lipstick as
they are amazing then I got two more
products from Kiko and this was a lip
liner and
lip gloss and lip liner and the lip
gloss I haven't tried yet this lip liner
is a very nudie color again and I
probably put this all over my lips and
because I've got this after I bought the
lipsticks and I got this just because I
wanted to put either Jayla or Naomi's
over the top us I did them ago really
really nice together and I think this is
like a couple of pounds so not marked at
all to finish off this lip gloss by Kiko
now because I always wear matte lipstick
I always thought like some days I just
want to be a bit more natural or not
when Matt and so I thought this was a
really really nice color it kind of
reminds me of the Naomi's mood and just
like the orange color it has a net yeah
it's so pretty and I just think it's
really good and it's really natural lips
and then to finish off the whole look
this is the Loreal fixing this and I
have been recommended this by so that
many people I've been told that the
matte one isn't actually too good and I
think this one was $7.99 and I tried it
yesterday and it was good and so I do
really really like this I'll just spray
this all over my makeup when it's done
and hopefully or last longer
so that's the end of this hall that's
all the makeup that I bought recently or
the drugstore makeup I've tried most of
the product as I have said before and I
definitely think they're worth the money
and they're good quality as well so if
you're looking for some new makeup
that's not too expensive then go check
it out because it is really reasonably
priced also look up because I am going
to do a makeup look on all of the makeup
so today in the next couple of weeks I'm
not too sure when and but make sure you
look up for that and I will see you soon
