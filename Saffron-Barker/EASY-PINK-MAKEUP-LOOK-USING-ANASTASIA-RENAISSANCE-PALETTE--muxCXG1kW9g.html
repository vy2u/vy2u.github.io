throughout this let other people know
and while my daily volume channel is the
new palette of mine that I actually own
I have been getting so many comments
doing the tutorial on it so this look
will also be showing you guys the toriel

I don't know then it will be assigned to
me that I need to start doing some more
makeup related videos so if you want to
see that on my channel please
masterpiece thumbs up and also you guys
enjoy and quickly melting before we get
into this video make sure you go
subscribe down below and or make an
almost post notifications as I'm going
crazy so let's get into the video so as
you guys can tell this is my birthday
now I'm going to start by applying Mac
prep and prime spray this is going to be
amazing because it just makes my skin
feel like fresh and healthy and I always
apply this before foundation now
foundation I'm actually used in me up it
became all nighter waterproof long wet
foundation is amazing
because it's so full coverage so it's
great on a night out and also I love how
yellow tone dis foundation is yellow
tones go really really wild my skin and
I really before them so hence I love the
shade and I love the foundation and I
used to shade for so I kind of just like
dab this around my finger on my face and
I'm just going as a beauty bender I'm
just blending it around my face and by
the way guys as you can tell I know the
color looks kind of weird right now kind
of look like Shrek but don't you guys
worry once it's all blended in it looks
absolutely fine and don't you normal now
next up I'm using the collection lasting
perfection concealer this is amazing
because it's so affordable and really
does the job it's really great at
highlighting my skin so I start off by
applying this underneath my eyes and
like a triangle shape and then I do my
chin it just above my Cupid's bow my
nose R then my inner of my forehead and
this is all the areas of my face which I
kind of want to highlight and you know
look a bit more like glowy and stand out
so I kind of just like wait for this to
soak into my skin and then actually go
back in with a Beauty Blender and again
it just blending it around my face
once that is all blended I then going
with my next contour kit now there's
various different shades on this contour
kit and I must admit I love every single
one but I've kind of mix two different
shades today so these are the two shades
that I've mixed for this look and I'm
just blending this just under my
cheekbones to make my cheekbones look
more defined and I kind of feel like
circular motions as well because I find
when you do sets emotions when
contouring it's a lot easier to blend
into the skin so that's kind of why I do
like surfer motions next up I'm going to
contour my forehead so I'm just applying
an even darker shade on my forehead and
just blending in that round again don't
you worry
again it will look fine once it is
blended it's all about the blending so
yeah it's just blending in my forehead
and then finally you guys know the drill
I'm going to be contouring my jawline to
make my jawline look sharp
so again just applying the bronzer on
there once or blended and then go in
with my Laura Mercier setting powder
this is absolutely fab and really makes
my makeup last longer so I kind of just
put this everywhere that I highlighted
my skin so again underneath my eyes but
then yeah I've got some in my eye and it
nearly killed me but don't worry guys I
am Alive yeah and basically just
applying this everywhere that I put my
concealer so again underneath my eyes my
chin that my Cupid's bow my nose and
then my in out of my forehead again and
I will let this set for about five to
ten minutes kind of just let it bake on
my skin and then I'm just getting a big
fluffy brush and just blending it in
obviously because this is translucent
powder it tells them to absolutely
nothing and you can't see it
next up to give more of a peachy look I
am applying my Too Faced blusher this is
in candy glow and then as finally you
guys know the drill the last step on my
skin is highlight this is my favorite
drugstore highlight of all time in fact
favorite highlight of all time and this
is the mary lou highlight art by the
balm it's such a nice glow as you guys
can tell and again
just apply this everywhere I put my
concealer so the top of my cheekbones my
chin up my Cupid's bow nose and in out
of my forehead again
for brows I use this brow powder that I
actually got from well the place that
I'd get my eyebrows done so if I can
find it I'll link it down below but I'm
not even sure she sells it online but
this is like a basic brow powder that I
used to fill in my brows and I think it
is really fairly easy how I do my brows
I kind of just like do the outside on my
brows at the shape that I wanted them to
fill it in like after so don't know if
you guys want to see like an actual brow
tutorial if that's something you would
want to see then let me know down below
as I know here I'm not really showing
you that well what I'm actually doing to
fill in my brows but it's pretty simple
now moving on to eyes which is the best
part I'm going to start with base by
using my Urban Decay primer and now
let's get on with these shadows support
shadows I'm starting off by applying two
different shades kind of like mixing
them together with the big fluffy brush
this is one from morphe I'm gonna link
all my brushes down below as well so I'm
going to start by applying golden ochre
and bird orange just mix in the shadows
together but remember to like not apply
too much because the shadows of so
pigmented seeing it make shadows with em
again blending into my crease is a mix
of realgar and red ochre I think you
guys are you pronounce it like this
blending those together and again just
blending it through my crease with this
shade though I'm starting in the outer
corner and then kind of by blending it
into the crease so the most pigment part
is clearly on the outer of my eye and
then just yet kind of like blending it
through next thing I'm going to go in
with the shade Venetian red which is
like a really lovely light cranberry
shimmery kind of color and again I'm
just placing it on the outer of the I
encourage of blending it through the
crease but again leaving as much pigment
as I can on the outer of my eye so I
kind of just like dabbed it on the
outside or then just blending out
but the next step I actually use two
different shades again Vermeer and
Primavera again it needs a starts like
shimmery glittery colors so these look
really really pretty on the lid of my
eye so those actually the final notes on
my eye and now actually go my winged
eyeliner and I use deep Kat Von D
eyeliner honestly this eyeliner will do
you and miracles like it is insane it is
so easy to use and honestly I think one
of the best makeup products I've ever
invested in so I mean it's moving that
expensive either like it's ought to be
amazing so if you guys really struggle
with eyeliner and get this and it will
it would do you miracle finally the last
shade of the pallet I use with love
letter and I just applied this with a
little pencil brush underneath my eye
and this basically just filled the look
I made the look so much more dramatic
and really stand out bold
so yeah this totally makes all the
difference in the world and give
something special to the look
some mascara I'm using one of my
favorites which is the Maybelline cat
eye mascara and just applying this to my
top eyelashes and my lower eyelashes and
then of course tomatoes look look more
completely I'm applying these false
eyelashes these are the House of lashes
and cronic lashes and honestly I've been
getting so many compliments about the
dashes they are honestly incredible and
even though they are very thick
eyelashes they are so wispy as well so
they still look like kind of but not
natural because they are very like you
know then yeah they're quite heavy
eyelashes but they're so comfy to wear
and they are very wispy as well which I
think make a great pair of false
eyelashes finally to complete this lip
I'm going to be applying lipliner and
lipstick so follow its loner a tiny
remember what shade this was but it's
one by Chinese connection so I'm going
to link you down below if you guys this
is such like a dark hot pink color and
not only do that outline my lips at this
but I also applied it on the inner
corner of my lip just to give it that
more darker full effect and then on top
of Maxia apply in the anastacio liquid
lipstick in the shade darker all color
and goes really really nicely with this
liner I think so yeah that's basically
it to complete this look now here is my
look I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial as I said I'm not a
professional but this is how I've been
doing this makeup that Greece Italy yeah
this is my look I hope you all enjoyed
and let me know your thoughts down below
yes there was good I hope you all
enjoyed this look by acting crazy today
I would be I love it so so much and it's
sexual coverage which is absolutely
great because honestly my skin at the
moment is having a breakout I've never
seen my skin be like this before it's
dry I've got a spot and yeah most users
have a break outside needed something
that's a bit more full coverage and a
bit more intense so this look is
absolutely perfect and obviously I make
it such as easy looks to restrain as
