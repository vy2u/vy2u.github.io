crack my back of autumn out like I can
crack my back a lot and I can I can make
my stomach growlin on command the only
thing I can do that is not a hidden
talent and I've told this in a video
before but it is about the only thing I
could think of is this I guarantee can
do as well is about bending my finger

straight now you're gonna use the other
hand I'm just trying to like train it

five minutes so we really have to go up
there and he was like okay and then he
gave her a pass like - like a Janee was
like a couple of hours ago right and I
got like so hyper like we do a
ridiculously high pass and I was walking
into Jai's room and I was like jumping
around having the time of my life and
Jason why are you so high fat like was
like it just to be there like what are

where he would just kept asking me why
like if you got like a surprise to
something have you found out something

you when I'm on word that he was so
excited I was like oh my god you're

chilled like you realize you and I think
that Mikey and I are chills sometimes
like at VidCon girlfriend but like other
times I'm like we need to clean the
apartment no crazy but like yeah I think
for the most part were pretty chill yeah
I think like if I saw you guys and you
didn't know each other like I think
you're so suited oh thank you what
tattoos or piercings do you want or do
you have I have four on this year and
three on this year and I you just have a
cartilage one on this year but it closed
up and I used to have another lobe one

Latia I did have my Brooke done yeah
yeah and then I did have my tragus I'm
both been out because I lost the back

want like a double like tragus that way
sure was happen my worst habit is my key
what's my worst habit JQ so no wait no I
have it
he's like our third stage of doing it
for like two days and I don't know no
one got with me right and it was so
weird is only when I was with Jake and
it was so good but I'm not I feel like
mine is I have a habit of asking people
to do things for me when I can do this
listen my habit is losing you lost all
of them yeah I lose everything
and I forget everyone and I'm so clumsy
and I bite my nails
oh don't throw your acrylics yeah if you
could swap places with somebody for a
week who would it be and why no no
really yeah cuz I feel like her life was
so fun and like she goes on all these
fun adventures or I would switch lives
with my brother frui just because he's
in like
right now and he's there for two months
and I think it'd be fun to like go to
Asia and explore yeah I think I would
probably saw places with I love Jessie
J's voice like I think she's insane I
don't know like yeah if you're very bout
to be a Disney character what would you
be and why
I'll be Cinderella Noble no don't want
to be like a maid buddy because she was
my favor every yo-yo with you yeah your
favorite Disney Princess anyone yeah she
was a mermaid
do you rather live without makeup or
live without half the job it's a hair
product because I can just that's what I
think cause I'd hate not one makeup like
so much of my time is on my part mm-hmm
but my natural hair like if it's not
strange and or if it's not powered it's
gross
it's so fluffy and it were me I'd have
to have it up like all the time like I'm
now having no you didn't like train your
hair done I think so maybe I do that
then yeah well I definitely would give
up half because makeup me into heaven
