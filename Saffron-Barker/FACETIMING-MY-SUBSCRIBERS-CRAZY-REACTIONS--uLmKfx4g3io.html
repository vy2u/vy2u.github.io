channel or now I hope you guys are
having a good day so far now for this
video

part of a video now little do you guys
know that you're actually going to be
facetiming me for this video today I'm
going to be facetiming my viewers and
honestly I couldn't be more excited I
know this might sound like a little bit
cranky or whatever but you guys
genuinely mean so much to me and
interacting with you guys is like the
best feeling ever because I would be
doing what I'm doing without all of you
guys that are watching this video that
would be my phone without you guys
watching my videos every single day so
this video to me actually means so much
and that's why I'm so excited so yeah if
you want to be a part of this video next
time and they make sure you guys follow
my Twitter so that you guys can
hopefully be a part of another video

so it's kind of going to be similar to
that however I'm going to FaceTime
