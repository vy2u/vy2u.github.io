because the top just isn't big enough
for jets arms so let's do take two of
this now you already did
I'm ready okay okay I don't know when
you do this right it's going to take
your hand further through I think you
need to get closer that's the issue
right one second okay so everyone
welcome back to the channel today we're
going to be doing and also make up the
toilet this give you a little bit
different and so let's do it
so ready me very nice so my fault so
they don't start with foundation for
this makeup routine so we're just gonna
grab this one if you could yeah there
you go it's a fancy beauty I'm just
gonna point it out so you guys can see
it nice and clear points it out for you
guys point it forward
you guys make it right there you go
you're nice and clear Center Beauty
foundation it's what we're going to do
is we're gonna squeeze the we're gonna
squeeze the foundation onto the lid as
you can see I've done this in the past
or you can squeeze a block on my hand
I think we'll do that and said actually
throw into the baby yeah yeah so we're
gonna squeeze it onto my yeah there you
go so I'm just going to show you
whereabouts I put it on my hand right
now there we go brilliant stuff then we
put the foundation back grab a blush or
I could have got my Beauty Blender I'm
gonna go for a bra so now we're nicely
going to put this onto my face am I good
to see you breathing oh he's a charger
so we're gonna dab it first
I cook sometimes evil endings for losers
just dab as you can see I'm doing right
now there you go and I'm gonna blend
down my neck now you know because it's a
little bit patchy anyways we need to
sort that out I've been meaning to say
that I'm sure this looks so great not
that one no we're not gonna go with it
blush yet yes there it is that's the one
we've been waiting for the concealer so
know me I put em like triangles
underneath my eyes sorry sometimes you
just you just miss the perfect triangle
that it's quite even missed hopefully
lighten my foundation and that's it for
the concealer everyone so I hope you
enjoyed that we're not gonna blend it in
[Laughter]
here's my Beauty Blender as you guys can
see loud and clear
sometimes I like to use the backend of
the Beauty Blender to use mine to do my
nose I'm not sure apparently I do today
anyways right I think it's all blended I
think it's all blended now which is
great isn't it thumbs up everyone make
sure you guys are liking and subscribing
down below woo now it's time to do
bronzer so we're gonna get this brush
that's next to me on the right and we'll
just apply this over C on my just below
my cheekbone and kind of like on my
cheek by to get that nice no not my
jawline sorry guys
my cheekbone just like Jed like no Jay
like this is meant to give me a good
cheap burn like here no yeah I'm not
perfect
yeah no not on my eyebrow right not on
my brow on my voice and the other side
sorry sometimes my hands get over
twisted no my eyelash I just know if
either ah yeah I never fire up
and that is bronzer done thora I love
this blush it's by benefit really really
digging my blush right now okay yes but
making sure we get a lot on here if you
do circular motions like this you get an
amazing look at the end of there and
we're still going with the same side as
you can clearly see and I think maybe
it's time to swap sides now so we're get
it to exactly that um and I guess we are
mixing the valar again and decided not
to be gentle this tutorial I thought
just whack it all on you know we're
gonna go for what one what doing so like
pecan no not the one so we're gonna cut
out the bronze are yeah I think maybe
not that ones I know too dark
maybe we gonna go for that the one
obviously we've chosen the color we're
gonna go for and so we're gonna whack
quite a lot of this one because I really
feel like highlight makes a look you
know and so we're just gonna keep on
going over one area and because I feel
like such a highlight isn't very me I
thought I don't lovely like wow you know
the glowing goddess look yama eyelid on
my eyelid on my eyelids on my eyelid
sorry guys
oh no my I didn't eat your coming
everywhere my face but my island let's
see my yeah right very good
oh I'm being so gentle
it's so nice oh this has been more of a
festival look you know because it's a
bit more in-your-face colorful more like
every single day look I wanna party
right now / know it yeah give me some
music on getting prey David brilliant
Freddie off so I'm gonna give you our
festival right now it was swaying like I
know I know right
we're now on our last and final product
so lipstick and oh okay we'll go over
this lovely red one here I feel like
they look already pop so I thought this
was just going to make you know the
finishing touch yeah mm-hmm slow and
steady would take two times going steady
are you actually trying pretty pictures
right when doing this I focus so long it
is really bad I felt like hitting you
though yeah you did you get poking my
eye and everything else I'm glad I had
my Lexus senses on so you didn't need to
do mascara yeah I'm gonna but I actually
think the worst part is this situation I
feel like I either need to tan or you
should have used my lighter foundation
which was this one here now look how
much darker this is to this like
genuinely this is so light this matches
my skin and this is like way too dark
even when the fake tan this is too dark
for me so maybe we should use my lighter
foundation but it wasn't directly in
front of jet to go for the dark one yeah
anyways I really hope you guys did enjoy
you can follow Jed on his social media

to subscribe and like I see you guys
very soon I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
