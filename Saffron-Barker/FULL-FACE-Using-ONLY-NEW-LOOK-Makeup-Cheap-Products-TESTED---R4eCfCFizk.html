back to my channel now for today's video
I'm actually going to be testing new
look makeup I'm so excited for this ok
wait look not my size of new that makeup
I am really excited I've never actually
had the chance to try new lip makeup
before so this like video is miscues to
buy it so I'm so excited
I'm going to give you guys my completely
honest opinions on this makeup I have
actually done like a couple of videos
similar to this with other brands before
and you guys seem to like freaking love
them so I'm going to leave those down
below so you guys to check out if you
want to after this video but yet it's
been so highly requested so if you all
enjoy then please smash a big thumbs up
and also subscribe it down below if you
guys haven't already also go subscribe
to my daily buggin channel as well
because I'm going to leave that down
below and a vlog every single day
because that's what a day blogger is all
right I'll have you ever had it when
like sometimes like I go just make my
hair as a joke and I can have my hair in
a bun it's like it's so annoying but I
have a have a pony so I can actually
split my hair now but yeah anyways I'm
so just like rivaling off-topic I hope
you guys enjoy and let's get in to the
video okay so I'm going to start off
with primer this is a illuminating
primer so I think this is going to be
like perfect for my skin because I love
primers okay I just dropped it I love
primers that I like very moisturizing
I've said this so many times I don't
really have like particularly dry dry
skin but I just I like my skin filling
moisturize you know so it comes in like
this squeezy little tube which is really
nice because it's easy to get it out so
I feel like the white cream on my hand
and oh it is very moisturizing actually
it's like am serum is what it feels like
on my skin so so far so good as far as
the primer goes I mean you can't really
judge it just like wiping this all over
my face I can't really judge it much and
chill you know all of my makeup on my
face but it's definitely very
moisturizing alright so moving on it to
foundation so this is the no shine and
mattifying foundation overall with the
pad
I really like it it's very standard it's
very simple there isn't really much to
it but I definitely prefer like you know
more like simple packaging rather than
just too over-the-top and just like
tacky overall so yeah I picked up this
foundation I'm loving the package in so
I actually have always like a sneaky
look at this
now I actually the one thing I love
about this which a lot of people will
definitely dislike it's it's actually a
stick foundation so there's not like a
pump to apply it but I don't know why I
really have a thing about stick
foundations I actually love them because
it's so much easier to apply the product
to your skin you just literally wipe it
on it it's just so easy so oh god it's
like spilling everywhere so the first
thing you have to say about this is I'm
definitely loving the fact that it's a
stick foundation I have no idea if this
is my shade or not because the different
get chance inside new learn to actually
try it out so this is in the shade
natural beige I'm really hoping it works
I've actually got like a ton of my body
so I'm really hoping it matches to my
neck color rather than my actual face
color so that is what I'm hopefully
hopefully that's how it's going to match
so I'm just going to wipe this on now as
you can see it's just so easy to apply
on your face like the product just comes
out so much better with a stick I just
love it I love applying foundation like
this okay right it's all on my face now
I've seen the color once is bended it
will actually look really good so I'm
nobody applying this with my damp Beauty
Blender and just you know dubbing around
so far its oh my goodness it's blended
really nicely actually I'm really liking
this
I'm also this is also down to the primer
because the primal is very moisturizing
so I think that definitely has something
partly to do with this but it's blending
so nicely and I think I think I said too
light lighter shade now is only because
my neck is very dark but we will we will
make do what we've got also do you know
what that I wanna think I think I've
made is I think I've actually applied
too much to my face because I think with
this foundation and little definitely
goes a long way
and it's blending look how well it
blends that's actually amazing I'm just
I'm so annoyed at myself and I'll get in
a darker shade it looks so dark inside
the packaging so if I was you guys
definitely go for a darker shade than
what it looks in the packaging or if you
have time just try it out in the shop
again same is the foundation that
honestly blended on my skin so quickly
and I don't really want to like keep
comparing brands but if I compare this
to the H&amp;amp;M foundation that I tried last
week I definitely prefer the new look
one I'm a singer around the same price
it's about like mid drugstore kind of
price I would say I think it was $7.99 I
might be wrong I'm going to leave like
the prices somewhere on the screen but
yeah I definitely prefer foundation
because it blended on my skin so nicely
it was so easy to apply it was so quick
my skin it will so moisturize like a
little goes a long way and it definitely
doesn't feel cakey as well like I would
definitely use that foundation again and
I said about the hmm one last week so
this one is pretty good okay so moving
on it's you can see now I'm going to be
using this cover and protect concealer
crayon now I miss playing for me
personally
crayons having never worked for me
because I just went it so hard to blend
so I mean this could like shock me I
really don't think I want to have like I
don't know I have my good positive
thoughts on this but just crayons have
never really worked out for me but just
going to kind of like you know just not
even just you know just keep straight
away in my honest opinion as if I've
never I've never used it before firstly
I wish I got a lighter shade but they
were completely out of soap this is the
only one left and they did actually also
have liquid concealers so they are
actually they're actually out of stock
as well so this was literally the only
concealer I could find in the store it
isn't going to have to do I think it's
definitely easy to apply those so we're
going to give it a go I'm going to apply
some underneath my eye oh actually it's
quite a good shade I guess it is a
little bit lighter than my foundation so
that's good
really lies in the shade of it so far
and it definitely is very easy to apply
however the only thing is that I'm
worried about is if it's actually easy
to blend however I kind of really
doubted myself because this is a lot
easier to apply than I was expecting it
to be normally they're really hard but
that's gone on my face really really
nicely so I'm going to put a little bit
on my chin it's really hard to see how
much I'm putting on those I think I felt
like way too much under my eye but hey
ho so I'm going to put a little bit
going up my nose and then I'm going to
put a little bit on my forehead as well
when I say a little bit I basically mean
quite a lot I've got quite a lot on my
face but it's all good okay so I'm going
to go with my Beauty Blender and try and
blend oh my god hey this is actually
blending a lot better than I was
expecting it to I really doubted myself
on this this obviously this I genuinely
think is one of the best concealer
crayons I've used because normally every
time I use a concealer crayon or every
time I try to use a concealer crayon it
is so hard to blend I don't know what it
is I think it's because isn't there
quite thick and heavy so that's why
they're really hard to blend and I mean
it definitely is making my makeup look a
little bit more cakey but it's blending
a lot nicer than I thought it was so I'm
disappointed in myself
saffron come on I'm so doubted myself
with this concealer but actually it's
blending a lot better than I was
expecting it to right so this is the
concealer blended on my skin honesty is
definitely brightened my skin art is
definitely a brightening like concealer
it's really done a job and I'm actually
really I'm really surprised honestly I'm
actually really liking that I believe it
was 399 I'm actually glad that the
liquid concealers will run out because
now is actually giving me hope with
crayon concealers I actually genuinely
really like that now I'm not going to go
on with a contour palette and this is
the contour powder shading kit and I
believe it has a contour a bronze and a
highlight
shake I really like the fact that it has
a mirror as well it's so much nicer the
fact that it has a mirror I literally
hate pallets and don't because if you're
like whatever running late for anything
it on the train you just want to sit
yourself out and don't have a mirror
it's like so forced raging I think I'm
going to mix the darkest Brown and then
the more of the light light East Bay she
kind of brown together get that like
perfect kind of bronze on my face okay
I'm going to go with a contour brush I
didn't actually really want to get new
look makeup brushes I might do that as a
separate video but I wanted to use
brushes that I knew kind of like what
does that mean says so then I'll just
basically be focusing on the makeup so
that's why but I'm going to be mixing
these colors together and I'm just going
to be applying it where I would normally
contour my face which would be my
cheekbones the only thing with powders
if it's so hard to get in the right
place so that literally just looks like
a big blob before I brown on my cheek
but when it's lended like it'll be fine
but it's pretty much impossible to get a
dead straight line when it's a powder so
I'm trying my hardest guys I'm also
applying some on my jaw line and then
I'm going to apply a little bit on my
forehead as well but again I will blend
in after this is a lot darker than I was
expecting it to be this is going to take
a lot Thank You ver to be blending
really quickly on my skin but I think I
definitely should have just used a
lighter shade because murk I'll slip in
a dark that is I've always kind of had a
color issue this video why the times
blender guys is going to be all good
this is the console blended into my skin
and much as I really could blend it into
my skin if you injured so easily I feel
like so far I literally have nothing bad
to say about new lip makeup apart from
the fiber in the brighten store where I
actually went to buy the makeup pretty
much all of it was sold out so maybe
like you know your shapes and stuff
maybe like grab on line or whatever so I
know I did actually just contour my face
but honestly I'm Noah joking I went east
to do Newark and I was looking at the
highlighter I always was a little
highlighted first because it's like my
favorite thing ever and I saw like all
the blushes and the bra
others and the shimmers and oh wow so I
never ever ever used like a bronzing
shimmer but honestly because I fell in
love with the packaging in just the ways
this note I honestly just like couldn't
resist so I'm going to be applying some
of this like bronze shimmer on my face
as well just because it's so flippin
pretty the bronzers the blushes and the
highlighters are literally insane like
I'm obsessed and I haven't even tried
them yet I just I really hope they're
going to be as pigmented as they look
okay it comes out really flip and dark
and it's so shimmery part of me wishes
that I didn't apply to what I really try
to not apply that much but I got way too
much on okay I feel like this is going
to take a lot of blending though so the
blusher is actually so so pretty it's so
similar I'm really hoping it's as
pigmented as it looked I actually got
the one in the shade pale blush I was so
in the cider for such a long time
because all the blushes and literally so
so stunning and we want to make a love a
little bit of shimmer so my first
impressions is really really nice
however it's not really given much blush
it's really just giving a shimmer like
on a day just looks like a pinky tone
highlighter so this isn't as amazing as
I thought it would be because I thought
maybe I should have got like a darker
shade pink but really this could be
highlighter
I feel like now when I put highlighter
on my face I'm literally just going to
like a hot shimmery mess right so this
is the highlighter that I picked up this
is in the shade pink pose so I guess it
has I don't know and there's more like
whitish in your life but I guess is
going to have some sort of my pinky
toned to it so take a look this
highlighter so pigmented so pretty I see
novice guys look at that that is what
you call a good highlighter
my cheek is like glowing now why don't
you both stand out so much when I have
highlighter on it by literally I cannot
go a day without because I feel so bad
when I don't my highlighter so with
everything
I've used my space so far I'm actually
really pleasantly surprised with how
well it turned out and how easily
everything's blended the only thing I'm
a little bit disappointed in is the
blusher because I was so excited about
and honestly it just looked like a
highlighter it was literally just pure
shimmer there was no like pinky toned
really in it I'm now going to go in with
eyes I don't actually fill in my
eyebrows really because I actually I
mentioned this in last week's video but
I've actually got my eyebrows micro
bladed like semi cat food so I don't
really have I need to brush them into
place but I don't actually really need
to fill them in right now I'm going to
move on to eyeshadow now there were at
the Middle's like six different options
with the eyeshadow palette so there was
like a quite big range for like I shadow
colors and like the options which is
very very good this palette oh my
goodness I can't open it but I am
totally obsessed now the only issue with
this palette is it doesn't actually have
a name for the shadows so I'm just going
to go in with this one here whatever the
hell it's called it's kind of like a
brownie Pinkie Hashanah guess I'm just
going to apply this all over my lid I'm
really not like an eyeshadow Marcel so
I'm really not going to go like above
and beyond with this eye look I'm no
just going to blend this in all over my
eyelid just sounds like a really simple
look you know
this color is actually so pretty it's so
so natural and just I don't know I love
it okay I'm just going to honesty this
is like the most basic look ever but I'm
like you're just going to go in with
like this pink kind of like shimmer here
which is really really pretty and I'm
just gonna play some on the lower of my
eyelids and also in the corner of my
eyes as well the only thing I would say
is there is a lot and a lot of full bag
with this eyeshadow that literally it's
just like crumbling my face is getting
that good game more emotion on it as the
sneaker routine goes on I want to see
gonna be glowing gooder so by the end of
this antimony for the first time ever I
don't know it's going to be a good thing
now I didn't pick up an eye liner and I
did actually pick up four C's but I did
pick up a mascara and this mascara is
the false lash extreme volume mascara
and there was actually quite a big
variety when it came to mascaras and it
knows about like four or five options
and it was I think it was like four or
five options so it works like a big
variety like considering its mascara so
this is kind of the ones that I really
really liked and I'm just going to plan
the solutions so far I'm really liking
this Escarra because it's definitely
given them a lot of length without
making it a little really comfy and
they're really nice and spread out so
I'm definitely all about this mascara
okay so this is the mascara overall I'm
actually really feeling it especially
because usually I always wear falsies
and there were no or forces that I even
wanted to try out my facebook list on a
beautiful if eyelashes just really they
weren't good my honest opinion I really
didn't like them they would you
they were like smaller than my natural
lashes so it's like now I just like this
pass without them but for little scar
they've definitely given them a lot of
length and they definitely spread my
eyelashes out as well they're not so
clumpy especially because that by Mike I
always have a problem when it comes to
mascara I end up always making over scar
really comfy so they definitely likes
right smell and giving them a lot of
them so I'm refilling them
I'm now going on to our last step which
is actually in lipstick now I put two
different options because I was so
undecided on what lipstick to go for
because there was two different styles
now there is the super matte liquid
lipsticks and then there is also the
this is the matte velvet lipstick crayon
and I actually love a lipstick crayons
as well and I literally am obsessed with
this color so I'm going to give you two
different looks so this for the crown
looks like pretty much just like a
crayon but let's actually give this a go
so this is the lipstick crayon that I've
actually got on my lips right now it's a
lot of poverty than I was expecting it
to be but it was very easy to apply it
because it's like really really creamy I
think I'm actually just going to apply
the pink over the top as acting kind of
like ombre this and I think it could
look really cool so I'm now going to go
in with the super matte liquid lipstick
okay I'm going to give this lipstick ah
it's the packaging of this is like so
exciting it looks so much more expensive
than it actually is which is like always
a good thing you know so I'm going to
like put this in the middle of my lips
and kind of Umbria I've lost them on my
tune this is a lot more pink than I was
expecting but it's so nice I just don't
know how I'm going to break this I'm
actually living for this color now now
with the lipstick it actually dried
matte really really quickly now I'm
going to give the good old kiss testers
either actually worse okay the only
thing is look is suppose that I mean
I've left it for about 40 seconds maybe
and it feels kind of dry but obviously I
don't know maybe I should wait a little
bit longer but it's still like but it's
still s and lip ring on my hand so it is
like the best matte liquid lipstick I've
ever tried because I know if you guys
have actually tried the Kylie liquid
matte lipsticks they are unbelievable
like you
it's your hand after five seconds and no
product would like print onto your hand
so this is like the best market lipstick
I've ever tried but the formula is
really really nice and again easy to
apply and is actually a really pretty
shade overall and I know if you think
they've kind of you know blended quite
nicely as well so this is the end result
once I hope you all enjoyed this video
my overall opinions on new lip makeup I
actually really really wrote it
everything's so easy to apply couple of
the things I tried were raised the
colors that they actually looked in the
packaging so I mean that's the only
downfall of the makeup the fact that
yeah the colors were really what they
look like so definitely if you're going
to try a new lip makeup I would say you
know actually try the colors in the
store before you go home and try it on
because the shades are a little bit
different when you actually try them on
your skin compared to what they look
like
in the packaging overall I really did
like using this makeup if there's any
more brands that you guys want to see me
test out then please let me know down
below because I've always look at the
requirements and going to be replying to
your comments in this video so special
like subscribe down below as well if you
guys haven't already
but yes this is me that's not rambling
on and hopefully I will see you guys
very very soon mwah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
