see my goodness okay if you guys haven't
noticed already today I'm joined with my
brother Casey and today and today we're
gonna be doing a very exciting video one
thing you guys have requested multiple
times now I have done a lot of videos
like this on my channel however I've
never actually done it where I guess the
price of things usually Casey gets to
the price of things it's always switch
things up a bit I'm only gonna be
guessing the price of my brother's boy
things but I have nobody to really buy
for this boy because I don't have
boyfriends cuz I'm going yeah oh good
yeah do boys guys vote in the poll of
your team go or team boy but before we
had you get into this video I do just
want to say also we filmed a video over
on Casey's channel where I did actually
guess the price of baby things can it
went down right through at Highland
server I hope you enjoy this video if
you do smash a like and subscribe down
below if you guys haven't already and
also if we get to 60,000 likes then
Casey and I would definitely film again
and something similar to this we have
some other ideas we don't
okay so smudge your like subscribe down
below and let's get in the video right I
feel like I should be like first stop
but it's actually gonna be useless so
first our products right okay this
product actually is has been in plain
sight no first product I can't see
anything
oh the glossy that's why I was like oh
my glasses I know it's not but they were
in the men's section this actually make
me see better no no no why everybody's
my glasses I know what to do now that
I've got 3d cinema glasses on I all
right so let me just clarify right these
aren't necessarily just for boys these
products these are products that I use
and I know it's a from doesn't use what
you get there are four things oh my god
I don't believe okay 40-pound yeah they
were cheap that's quite good yeah very
cheap I've never do that
because there's also no good so it's a
razor oh my rates are very sign up okay
I'm not you're really gonna hate me for
this I've used this before I was like
but nothing was getting rid of any of my
hand I was really confused that's
absolutely disgusting why don't you say
my name don't use this for my face I
don't know what let me give you a clue
it's expensive because it doesn't shave
anything don't usually doesn't use my
name poof refreshed 147 pounds 50 pence
good my razor point four pounds yeah but
there's no choice like this should last
robot
next up right I think if saffron gets
this wrong by more than 20 pounds there
should be a forfeit having to smell them
up close the range 1 1 of my pairs of
boobs like 280 I could not imagine
myself way like Don shoes that cost 200
pounds no but you can ask yourself I
feel so probably well yeah I probably
could but that's so different that's
actually doing out yeah and this is like
actually like you're doing next up I
wouldn't know this weird thing that's
okay we just gone for them playing
social looks for my xbox one Joe am I
just the controller okay
expensive oh yeah you I think people
smash these up a lot yeah please get
replaced off often I know I reckon it's
still really expensive are you ready
three three see all we were close can be
about 60 depends whether that was good
yeah I swear they going through them so
quickly
two more layer to my over hard way guys
this is the way I you know that weird
like it's really not but it's just so
guys never you I don't want to use my
mom isn't came into the bathroom I'm um
shoved up my nose oh my mom what are you
doing
and she's like see this video do it up
oh my god yeah and no she said that I
have always double this pause so what's
the plan Oh knows how I'm paying that
for that I have no idea how much it is
oh I had to look out that's really T
$8.99 who want to plug your nose just
like my mom does yeah oh my god I saw I
lost

Gucci bail oh wait I think I think you
should know the price yeah I did
gucci belt that she ended up buying for
someone else because she liked my one so
much so you should know the price very
95 okay maybe I'm a 224 maybe because I
didn't buy or not buy was oppressing so
I had a look up know what spending on

the video I really hope you all enjoyed
it was a bit more like a chattier virgin
