hope you guys are all well and I hope
you guys have had an awesome day so far
so if you guys saw last week's video you
would have sinned I actually pranked my
boyfriend with song lyrics and it went
down when it went down brilliantly all
the comments was like you need to do
this again you need to do this again
today I'm back and I'm doing another
summer prank but not to my boyfriend
this time to my friends some are
youtubers and some what to just like my
best friends so the song that I'm going
to be using today is by Little Mix and
the song is hair now the lyrics in it I
think is so perfect this sounds like a
break-up contest so I think is it a
little bit more realistic that other
songs that has been like trending and
stuff and I think either my box of
BuzzFeed start of this trend I'm not
entirely sure because there's so me like
different mixed opinions and who started
this trend so I don't know who started
it but everybody's doing this I know I
just thought after my last prank my
boyfriend it went down so well why not
do it again as it's so much fun so
before I do quickly jump straight into
this video I do just want to say I also
have a daily vlogging channel so as well
as subscribing to this video if you
enjoy it make sure you go head over to
my daily blog internal that's going me
the top line of description down below
you can also go and subscribe to that
channel as well so make sure subscribe
and let's get into this video I am
filming a video what's the first person
that I'm going to test is a good friend
of mine could Anastasia Anastasia is
also a British youtuber she's actually
been on my channel before we've actually
clubbed before and she's literally the
sweetest girl ever so I don't know
she'll fall for this or not I feel like
because she's a youtuber
she might catch on to it quicker than
maybe my other friends that aren't so
much into YouTube but fingers crossed
that she doesn't
I got a brother explained I'm a bit
confused I'm also a bit worried oh no oh
I didn't it feels like I feel so bad for
her because like that's a triple tap
she's triple attacked me there like she
is worried right now like to me that
would also sound like worrying if
somebody sent me that text however I
think this second line might just like
change her mind it should get a bit as
worried after this line cuz this line I
think kind of gives it away that it's
more a song because it just made no
sense at all it's Donna Summer
what laughing face I felt like you may
be pranking me but then also I'm
slightly worried so I don't know what to
do okay after this next line I think she
might just catch on now
yeah she's got it laughing face laughing
face loving face I'm so shy tip music so
I fell for it there you go that's
Anastasia for you so yeah she kind of
fell for it straight away I'm kind of
over with my next friend who isn't a
youtuber doesn't catch on so quick
fingers crossed because Anastasia caught
on it the after like for the second or
third line something like that so the
next person I'm going to be texting or
pranking is my good friend Libby now
Libby does actually watch a lot of my
videos so don't know if she will capture
on however as I said she's not a
youtuber herself so she might not but
I'm I'm kind of hoping that she doesn't
however I find like if Libby believes me
she's gonna be so worried like that's
just the type of person she is
I got a brother what are you okay your
crew is gonna suck what are you talking
about
she got past the second line it's all
cool I think she doesn't think it's a
practice yet
about what South what are you on about
hahahaha
Jake question markets from my wisdom up
wait - wait what why what what's
happened okay she genuinely believes me
leave me if genuinely believes there's
something's wrong
I think she's used to me just likes
talking weird and being weird so she
just like thinks is so realistic tell me
I'm so confused bring me my shoulder
come on Arthur so Q ah nose ring the
exhibition is amazed much that is a lot
of x-rays right sir what's happened I'm
here if you need to talk ah that is a
good friend for you that is so sweet now
now I'm actually starting to feel bad I
genuinely feel so bad oh I'm here if you
need to talk there's no matter has he
done something really bad oh no what has
happened this next time I think is
either gonna make me even more confused
like what does she say back to me or
she's just genuinely not gonna believe
it because she knows I'm just not going
to get over Jake did she just like that
so I don't know this I think this line
could confuse her a lot
how do you broke up no way you should
just say that bring me now yes or no
you're like yeah what if I was in lippy
shoes I'd be like oh I'm gonna bring her
right now that why isn't she telling me
I'm like I'm like yeah like wow what a
tomato goes tomorrow wait okay I think
she might have just caught on right now
hang on a minute this is it Little Mix
song ha ha ha ha ha yeah she got it that
lasted so much longer than Anastasia
though that literally so much longer
that's crazy I actually started to feel
bad so when she was like has he done
something really bad I'm here if you
need to talk made me feel really bad I
was like oh God like I've already
babbled her now but she caught a lot
right so the next person I'm going to be
texting has also been on my channel
before he's a youtuber himself and this
is Elia I don't really like tend to
speak to Elliott a lot like I don't know
he's not like one of my bestest friends
so I don't know if he like genuinely
believed me because I think he's gonna
feel like kind of confused like why is
suffering like telling me this you know
I always have no idea how this is gonna
go
I got a brother yo what's up your crew
is gonna sign a car Christ AMARG
that makes no sense yeah he's definitely
in on earth is she texted me this and
what is she talking about right now
about what
who Jake what's up wait what did he do
huh
he still hasn't caught on to it yet that
like he still hasn't caught on to it I
think he's just like what is saffron
going on about like I don't know I think
he would really expect me to prank him
like Apple people so wait oh oh okay
here it goes
hang about animals can't take you no
longer question mark hey Godzilla race
can't take it no longer it's actually
the neckline of this song I looked them
up after get off my shoulder I was like
nah surely you're not having me on yeah
I don't think he like expected me to
prank him so I think I went down quite
well again you didn't last as long as
Libby but that that wasn't quite well
