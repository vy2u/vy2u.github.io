welcome back to my channel now for
today's video as you can see look at me
I look like a different person this is
so crazy if this is the first time that
I'm filming with short hair a part of
the video where I actually chopped my
hair so if you didn't see that video if
you're new here first time you see me
normally I have a long luxurious hair
and it's all gone I went for the chop
and it was a really good video I filmed
the whole process of it so if you want
to see that it will link that down below
for you guys to go and check out as I do
love it yes it is
oh my god yeah this is my new handle
guys I can't really flick it up March
this it's so strange it's just so weird
you know but yeah so today as I've
taught my hair I thought why not film a
video doing short hairstyles has since
I've taught my hair there's been so many
comments like the saffron oh I got it
takes but saffron you can't beat your
hair up you can't do this you can't do
that but yes I can I can still do so
many things to my hair maybe not as much
as they could do when I had long hair
they could so do some really cool and
fun stuff that's super super super easy
because I'm not very good with half so
these are going to be some really easy
hairstyles hopefully a lot of you guys
out that do you have short hair maybe
get you thinking you know so if you do
career any of these make sure you tweet
me let me know anyways I hope you guys
do enjoy this video it's not to like if
you guys do it if you want to see more
hair videos and subscribe down below if
you guys haven't already and let's get
in to the video this is definitely my
favorite way to wear my hair at the
moment take the section of hair that you
want to put up as you can see I don't
like to put too much of my hair up as I
like it to look as thick as possible put
this piece of hair into a ponytail as
you normally would but then once you
twist the band on the last turn don't
pull your hair at the entire way through
as you can see you're kind of like
laughs with this like a mushroom like
the Kim thing
now to turn this into a cute looking top
not take another hair band and tie
around so it's secure enough to pull the
hair through and spread it out so it's
bigger and more even the second look has
really got that sexy Taylor Swift vibe
it's really simple but transforms your
entire style so you want to start by
creating a side parting and flip your
hair over if it has like quite a flat
you can always backcomb it to give it
more height then take the section
nearest your ear and pull it as tight as
you can and just tuck it behind and then
you want to add a grip to keep it in
place and your hair behind will dress
full forward
space fans again it's so easy and look
great for festivals aka the cutest
hairstyle created create the middle
parting and put both sides into bun
Chee's twist both sides into like little
buttons and then again to make it look
bigger and better pull your hair like
through with your hands this makes such
a difference otherwise it's just gonna
end up looking really nice again pin to
secure your hair next up is Beach curls
I find it easier to separate the hair
into two I'm use I like a thickest color
for these so give it that cool kind of a
gravy 5 instead of like tight curls I'm
going as close to my scalp as I can and
you could just repeat this through the
hole of your hair
if you want to wage bigger you can just
run your fingers through it to space
them out more honestly I love this look
so much I think it's great for either
day or night time then I just kind of
like gave it a spray with some hair
shine and you can even add some hair
sprays go out to hold the curls in so
this one's pretty awesome it's a lover I
hate I am flipping I love this so what
you want to do is comb your hair through
it can either be straight or curly make
sure there is no knot and you want to
wet your hair and pin either side just
behind the ear to keep it flat I then I
sprayed some wet look gel spray to keep
that wet look throughout the day or the
evening be careful though to not go over
the top with it otherwise it's just like
really greasy I hope you guys enjoyed
subscribe make sure you guys much alike
and also gonna say yeah that's it kind
of ramen I hope you enjoyed yeah I'll
see you guys very soon
okay then I'll ending this this is the
way to that track I'll see you guys very
soon run bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
