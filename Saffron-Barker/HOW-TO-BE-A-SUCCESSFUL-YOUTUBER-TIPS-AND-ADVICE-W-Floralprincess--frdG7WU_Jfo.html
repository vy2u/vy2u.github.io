Anna you can notice my visitors are so
sorry
Oh pleasure a little while I would feel
bad for you that we're still going
strong stubborn air piano we are also
missing you start shall we smoke yeah so
this video is something a little bit
different what I usually do on this ship
no it's more like a chassis video right
and I might be super excited for it
because this video is all based on a
question but I know that I get off so
much and I was telling her about it and
she's like yes now I got half the jello
all the time and this is how the become
a successful youtuber now obviously lol
a we don't have 10 million subscribers
or anything like that but I believe we
do in fact wealthy are denarii and we
start liking only right for us to do
this video and then you get asked it a
lot so this is how to become a
successful youtuber so if you guys
enjoyed as much a big thumbs up and also
subscribe down below if you guys haven't
already I hope they don't take out and
Anna channel as well I'm going to leave
you down below because we filmed a video
over on there and I love their with all
of my heart so please go check her out
because she's amazing
and there's so time compared to you
right you're a little fast but I know a
lot of holidays to be fair to check out
the blogs as well
cheeky self promo acai you come with
your teeth eyes open don't do that
anyway right I hope you enjoyed the
video
number one is starting back with the
basics now a basic for me when starting
YouTube I know when I started youtube I
done it because I absolutely nothing oh
is this all of it as well but that's the
reason why yes I give me food nowadays
I've got a lot of people with sign you
choose either for the same or for the
money and personally I believe that's so
wrong yes it's definitely do it for your
own reasons and if you want to do it
don't do it for the same yeah don't do
it for money
why number two and that is filming
equipment so first for me I started by
film another North had little end on my
iPad today I actually started filming on
my iPhone I actually down my blog which
is still up like the video if you ever
lose a lot yeah all of years away
yesterday yeah the one that my iPhone is
still up so I actually started by daily
vlogging which is my favorite thing ever
I'm starting by selfie stick as well I
remember in my office yeah yeah selfie
stick in an iPhone and the news fair the
quality of is still great but honestly
like my size a lot of people as well Jon
result you to preserve life or I don't
have to buy a point more than question
maybe professional or a dozen people get
to know your personality and that how
they become to mark you it's actually I
hope that's why I'm going to say that I
hope it like mine are padded for her
personality I love what you have videos
because I watch them like girl this
cheers personality like I know I would
get along with her you know
I know probably the one thing I would
recommend sending up on would be a
camera obviously like the more you do it
the more you're going to want it camera
as well because obviously you are going
to get higher quality videos which are
so much better so if you right now you
will be able to see the camera I
actually use and this is the camera that
I use and then I have now and then to
swap my lenses but this is my favorite
lens this is Z Sigma 1.4 so there we go
I love it lenses because it actually
blurs out the background it's very soon
being very close but I literally love it
and over the time that I've done YouTube
I bought more and more lenses because I
love my playing around my own stuff so
the thing I mainly consider buying if
you're looking to buy something
definitely buy a camera I do more Zulia
softboxes and rewrites my videos as well
because I
we tend to film in the evening but want
to be naturalized the best Naturalizer
Distaso you can film in the morning if
we're going to be on the camera yeah but
you don't even really need to like send
out on the lights I would recommend
getting the lights before you get a
camera or a camera first and honestly
you're going to be a relative but
they're considering starting youtube to
start where with your iPhone iPad that
hardware solitaire diamo here we are
today with a camera and light eater and
everything else anything software right
now little bit cringe that was anything
software I always get our source
software I actually do search for my
videos I've always actually used the
same software and I did actually slow
down by the software straight away and
into actually Final Cut Pro so I see
Final Cut Pro is pretty much what every
YouTube by users nowadays however Anna
doesn't actually use where are you on my
name on my over on it's so good like as
much as I want to get Final Cut Pro Erin
will eventually get it but at the moment
I'm just settled with that and you just
don't do like stuff on it Carly as much
as Final Cut Pro but you can still do
stuff on it and it's really good to
start out although ever the good thing
with Final Cut Pro is you currently do a
bit more on ik will tell you a lot more
on Final Cut Pro so that's actually why
I use it and you can also by extension
packs and stuff which is all sensor
basically like you know transitions that
I used in salons which is Sloan class
like the odd effect that all comes with
Final Cut Pro and a lot of the youtubers
that I followed I found out that's what
they were using and that's how they've
got the transitions yeah that's where I
work towards Final Cut
whether I'm using is free it is you love
it I can do so much on it but I just
learned how to use it kind of where I
know so we use it for so long so yeah
definitely shout out with our new here
it just works way up one another really
important thing to remember is always to
be yourself I feel like there's going to
be a gorilla
there's a lotta business after on I
thought people want to watch you because
you're something new something different
and you don't want to copy what somebody
else is doing because you want to be
your own person and you want to go onto
YouTube and express what you truly
believe in what I see there already
is that so it out there and as much as
you absolutely amazing you know what you
have to have personality and if you're
trying to be her is there already inter
the already attested people already
watching her they want to watch you for
you and also when you're attending to be
somebody else that is an enjoyable they
finalize them at a couple of times later
I've sinned on this video and I'm I'm
that's why I want to do that and then I
do it I walked you back I'm like that's
not even me what gaining subscribers
it's something that's so important about
gaining subscribers is being consistent
I feel like if you upload every week on
a certain day they're going to want to
come back to your channel and they know
when to expect an up close if you miss
it up where it feels so bad on us as
well I definitely agree the key is
definitely consistency I believe that's
definitely how I gain subscribers
because our subscribers they set timers
themselves and they know when you're
going to upload like a TV show you know
when you're watching a TV show and it's
like all that TV shows on at 7:00 p.m.
on a Tuesday night and you know it's
going to be there I know so if you don't
upload it's like people going to lose
interest again and also promoting
yourself early out the social medias I
know I do that a lot I don't buy dated
Robin Channel I am right now however a
big big big no-no which I'm sure you can
agree is promoting yourself on other
youtubers channels if you're in
something really nice areas that you a
youtuber and I've definitely checked you
out subscribe to you but if you could
just comment in our sub for sub or I'm
going to YouTube our help me get to this
many stars ledges I don't know got my
personal opinion I've never really done
that so that's something so I don't
believe in but I wouldn't necessarily go
check out your channel for that reason
whenever there is gaining stuff is also
promoting yourself on your own channel
now a lot of people don't really know
this especially when starting up with
youtube and we've both hurt each other
on this as well episodes so much you can
do on YouTube that you don't a--from
realize now there's a lot of things
included in tags so if you're type in
your videos say the title of this video
I will then tag all the wives in this
video on my tab box there are 4-1 people
certain like these words that I come up
so it's always when your title and your
tags but if they relate and you're more
likely to gain views for their watch
dealing with hate now personally how I
deal with hate would just be to ignore
it and block it out it's definitely a
given that if you put yourself out there
on YouTube you are going to get hate
they're always different ways you can
deal with it yeah definitely now I know
when I started off youtube I obviously
got hey just like everybody else and
start to YouTube and this can come from
Jenna's it can come from a lot of things
I was they mainly come from like
jealousy and stuff only show me who I
was really got my way to heal something
out but the steps many people that do do
it and when I actually started off
youtube I was lucky enough I was
actually on holiday and I was in America
and it was the start of a six-week
holiday and I was the arrogance caused
by last year's goal but yet we had six
weeks of the holiday and I actually
started blogging out there and I started
gaining subscribers quite quickly which
was amazing and as I'm really proud of
myself I was really enjoying it and then
I go back to school I was like oh my
goodness everybody knows about my
YouTube channel and it was like this
massive thing in school and I get the
ball I was so scared to go to school for
honesty I bought how everybody said
about me I ignored or they hated me and
I just probably enjoyed what I was doing
so much I just don't really care they
sort of me you know it's been one thing
with hate is don't respond to it yes I
mean no point because that's what they
want they want a response and when you
respond to them but you just given them
what they want what so nice that is sort
of the colony that is the end of the
video I hope it helped you guys out it's
a little bit different to how I normally
I wear videos it's more like a chit chat
kind of like sit down one so I hope you
guys enjoyed the style of this video and
I hope you gained a lot out of it as
well as I said I don't I have been
artists questions so many times I'm sure
we've definitely missed some out so if
you still have any other questions that
you want me to answer or Anna we're
definitely going to be working in the
comments so just write your lowdown some
though so to sum this video are my top
tips what our top tips would be
definitely be confident do it because
love it don't fibers our fireback gain

so awesome

yourself and nobody will they definitely
believe in yourselves
