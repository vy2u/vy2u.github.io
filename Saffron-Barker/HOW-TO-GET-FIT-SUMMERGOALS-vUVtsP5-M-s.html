my channel so I really excited for you
guys to see this video today as I spend
a lot more time on it and I'm feeling so
proud of this video I want to thank NCS
for sponsoring this video and giving me
the opportunity to share my summer goals
because I'm so excited for this video
and we don't know what you know NCS is
the make sure you go check them out the
website and all those social media links
will be in the description hello
basically if you're a 16 or 17 year old
and you're looking for new experiences
summer then NCS is an amazing
opportunity to you guys to take it's
great for making new friends and
developing skills you never thought
you'll be able to do and you'll be able
to learn teamwork skills and leadership
skills and if you're like me and you've
only just finished your GCSEs and you
wondering what to do this summer
then NCS go fright is the amazing
opportunity you should definitely go
sign up so my hashtag as summer goals is
to become a lot more active to come
healthier to come thither so that's
something I've been up to recently which
basically what this whole video is about
and it's something I'm definitely going
to be carrying on in the summer as it's
a hashtag summer goals so I hope you
guys like this video make sure you smash
that big thumbs up if you guys do tweet
me or let me know in the comments below
what your hashtag summer goes are so
yeah let's get into the video I hope you
guys enjoy let's go
to be more active outdoors has been one
of my summer goals recently being out in
the fresh air motivates me more and I
find it a lot more fun as it misses
things up a bit as you can tell I am NOT
a good runner and I don't always
particularly enjoy running but going out
with the negative mind you're only going
to see negative results so something
I've started doing is setting myself
goals so I can push myself a little
further each time and trust me when you
do you feel so so good about yourself
well yeah so after doing some cardio I
like to do some different types of
exercise so I like to do some squats and
I love doing lunges as well and then
finally of course after you've done all
the exercises all that hard work you
need to make sure you stretch out the
body because if you don't stretch after
exercise you can end up pulling muscles
in your body and trust me it can kill so
make sure after exercise you're always
always always stretching what make sure
you stay hydrated while exercising
especially when it's a hot day like this
being healthy of course deliver
healthier lifestyle you're going to need
to pop back you're saying you can over
you chocolate bar again the sometimes
you can make a lot healthier choices not
only is it good for your body but it's
also good for my in the summer I make a
lot of smoothies for this one I start
off by cutting up my melon in turn
little chunks and then I put it into my
so just get some hominoids and I squeeze
up the juice out and then of course for
in too much sleeping probably the map
suit your favorite so I always put them
in a smoothie then top five raspberries
and talk about some more berries some
blueberries and then finally I always
like to put spinach on my smoothies
because honestly you can not taste it
yet it is so so happy for you it's
always good to have green eye then go
ahead and put in some fat-free yogurt I
put quite a lot of fat-free yogurt in
there if I'm honest not many people tend
to put that much in but basically what
it does is it thickens up the smoothie
which is why I love it so you can also
go ahead if you like bananas and put
bananas in this movie because it will
make it even thicker than just the
yogurt and here is your finished result
and oh my goodness
it tastes so good so make sure you try
it because it's all of your five a day
so go ahead because it tastes oh yeah -
snack idea that I absolutely love
honestly this is one of my absolute
favorite snacks I eat these all the time
there's people on my blog at channel you
would definitely know that basically
it's these crisping crackers and what
you do is you just put tomato and
cucumber on them and honestly they taste
amazing
there's so much better than they look
and they honestly taste so good and
they're so easy to make they also do so
good with mozzarella as well
unfortunately I didn't have it in the
fridge but you can also add mozzarella
or add some cheese to make that extra
special taste
some ago trying to stall pre-warning I
can operate down in a dosa let me help
oh good
yeah that was in my video for today I
hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to
sign up to NCS to achieve all summer
goals let me know in the comments below
