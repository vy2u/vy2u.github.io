items in this home today and I'm excited
to tell you but that's good into it what
so the very first thing that I picked up
this is actually the first thing I had
in my car I always have things in my
cart and a sauce like it's always just
sitting there so I'm so happy that I
managed to get some it's from that so
the first thing that I got from a sauce
was these adorable hippo pajamas but
this launches hippo pajamas it's hippos
in - - which means it ten times cuter so
they're little short pajamas not how
cute they are look at the two dudes and
then the top is actually cuter than the
bottom I have anything to at the tag off
yeah look how cute that is it's kind of
like do a really really short top it's
kind of like a crop top it feels like
the material of it is gonna be so comfy
and then at the back you can see the
tutu it's oh I'm holding it weird wait
whoa whoa wait
yeah the back you can see the two tear
and it like um are you gonna see me
wearing these in my vlogs these were 20
pounds so these are the first things
that I picked up from a soft and then
obviously I was shopping in the PJ
section and I am desperately desperately
like desperately needed a new dressing
gal for so long I have to at the moment
and both of them have just like they're
just dicks
they're just discolored and dirty and
every okay I was gonna say every
dressing um I bought has been a pink and
white but this one's gonna be pink and
white cheese so must say something about
me I got the most adorable as we all
know I am obsessed with unicorns I got
this light pink unicorn dressing gown
and it's so fluffy so fluffy I'm gonna
die who's seen that if you guys know I'm
what about let me know down below it's
this pink unicorn dressing gown at the
back it has the unicorn wings in the
light blue color I burn
look at the Hat it's all multicolored I
couldn't not how much was this I don't
even know how much this was I'm pretty
sure it was 30 pounds that we take a
little look it was 30 pounds and I love
this especially because if you guys have
been following my daily Volks you would
have seen the two dressing gowns I work
continuously that are kind of like old
and ratty and I just really needed a new
one so this is my excuse to get a
unicorn dressing gown I brought a lot of
things from the gym because I tried to
get things that I actually needed not
just like tops and dresses for the sake
of it so I got which I love these night
leggings so they're gray they've got the
elastic at the top and then yeah it's
like white elastic inside and it has the
knight logo but then it kind of like
fades in it has like this triangle to
basically like we just say fades in it
kind of like well what's the word I'm
looking for
I don't know what the word is that I'm
looking for but they are so nice these
were 18 pounds I just love the elastic
at the top because they're just gonna be
so comfy and I think straight up drive
from this video I'm actually go to the
gym so I'm gonna be wearing these the
second thing that I got for the chin
which I'm not sure if it's gonna look
good on me but I really want to because
I love the colors
and this is this black eyelet gold
Naik top I say it's gold it's kind of my
gir bronzy gold and it hangs down really
really low and I love the back so the
back and the front
I love but what I do love the fact that
it hangs down so low but then it's like
I don't know basically no too good on me
so I really hope that it does this was
30 pounds so I mean it is quite
expensive for what it is but for me like
it's gym top if it does look good and I
do like it and I keep it then I will be
wearing this pretty much every single
day so it's gonna be getting a lot of
use out of it and I think I put it in a
start on I got it in a size small so it
is quite long still because sometimes I
like to get while I like to get gym pops
oversized but this is like a long
Jim top anyway and then it's like longer
at the back and it has like mesh at the
back so yeah I really really like it the
next thing that I got which are adorable
let me tell you this is from Abu Avenue
look at the little bag is so cute
because they always have like pink
tissue paper and I love it
this would be such a cute Christmas
present by the way I think I don't want
my friends to be watching this and find
out why I'm getting it for Christmas so
I'm mocking my name names but I think
this would be adorable Christmas present
if you don't know what to get somebody
there isn't too expensive that is
adorable get these for Christmas look at
these socks they are so cute and they
are so fluffy so thick
these were 14 pounds is so cute because
imagine like were you just looking down
at your feet and you have little bears
on your feet and then also enjoyed
having you I got another adorable thing
which is this cute little pink armor as
well I actually love her murmurs when I
went to school I had towards school
actually in the winter I felt like I was
dying like in the winter when you walk
at this school like really really early
in the morning it's freezing cold my
hands and my nose would be the first
thing to get cold so I would always take
a hammer more with me to school and I
always take a spare foot on the way back
because obviously you just click the
button and then it like it heats up so I
love a hand warmer so I had to get
another cuz I couldn't find mine even
though I don't go to school anymore I
know I will be using this a hell of a
lot if you would come up and your hands
get cold just get yourself a hot mama
because honestly they are a lifesaver
and this one was six pounds from a booth
Avenue
okay so you guys love following the
trend just like I do I think you were
guessed by the address box what type of
shoes these are now I am in love these
are these nmds look oh my goodness
I love them so much I've been wanting
these for such a long time they are
white with the gray and white laces
I think the laces is what actually makes
it for me I don't think there would be
anywhere near as nice if they just have
plain white laces and then I absolutely
love the back and so I decided about
these shoes because I want to use them
for the gym as any new gym shoes and
they're really nice and they are like
gym shoes
but then it's like I want to weigh them
out at the same time but I grabbed these
these actually came up really small I'm
normally a size 6 or like now on then a
six and a half bottom or six than a six
and a half but I actually got these in a
size seven because they come up quite
small but I love these so much you would
see me wearing these a hell of a lot I
also love I don't know if you guys have
seen the base once in these I brought
these and then I went to another Shabab
and I was like okay I love the base
which one do I get which one do I get
and I probably should go the beige
because I get everything so messy that
these are probably gonna get dirty so
quickly fingers crossed I don't
everybody pray for me down below that I
don't get these dirty next thing that I
got another term related thick well this
isn't really just for the gym so this is
this nice gray sweater I love this
because when it's on as you can see the
next really high it's kind of like the
neck kind of bunches I felt like I'm
gonna I'm gonna put it on for you guys
I'm actually gonna go that far and put
it on for you because it looks so much
nicer on then it does off and it's all
fluffy inside as well it's so warm okay
hey do you know what I mean but like it
rolls up on the neck here it keeps you
so warm so this is this night jumper
that I guys really really tight on the
arms which I love as well because it
keeps this just keeps you so warm and it
looks so nice and I'll show you the hood
up yeah this was surprisingly nowhere
near as expensive as I thought it would
be I think it looks so much more
expensive than it would be I thought I'd
be like 65 85 pounds but it was actually
45 pounds so I actually thought this is
really really good for the money and
yeah I like this so much only thing that
like kind of annoys me about it is I
really wish it had pockets I hate
wearing jumpers that I've really thick
and don't have pockets in it but overall
I love the jumper and I think it's so
good for the price as well so now I'm
gonna take it off I also got the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation I've been
wanting this for a very long time but
I've always used the same foundation
because I find foundations really really
hard for myself to buy because not many
assume I skin that well but I tried the
Too Faced one today at you for this
makeup look this is incredible it's
amazing coverage like
is quite thick but it doesn't feel it so
much from your skin the reason I don't
like using that foundation is because
even though it's really high coverage
and it is really good in that sort of
way it's so thick on your skin that it
feels like cakey and it's horrible this
doesn't feel so thick on your skin which
is why I absolutely love this foundation
and I would definitely be using it again
in fact this is probably gonna be my new
foundation for now on like my go-to
foundation it's a bit more expensive
than my normal foundation though it was
29 pounds and I don't know if it's gonna
last that long as I've only had this on
an hour so far so I'll let you guys know
over my vlogging channel if you want to
find out more about this foundation yes
I definitely recommend this I've only
had it an hour but so far I recommend
this foundation and I got the shade like
that so the next thing that I got I'm
actually like I'm kind of scared about I
loved with these online there are a lot
Chinese art in bra life then why I was
expecting them to be and I don't know if
I'm really gonna be able to pull them
off I would love to I haven't tried them
on yet but I really really hope that
I've pulled it off as you can tell it
starts like denim but then it goes into
that shiny color and I just think they
are so cool I love the like rip ends at
the bottom it's so nice how they just
kind of end like that it's kind of hard
to show has like rips on the legs and
stuff and I just think they are really
really cool jeans and I really really
hope that I can rock them I think yeah
it's one of those things I don't know if
I'm gonna pull off fingers crossed that
these that nice as well if you can pull
this off by them because they are so
nice
and then I also got another pair of
jeans I am like in need of jeans at the
moment and I've never ever owned beige
jeans before I love wearing high-waisted
I love stretchy jeans I cannot wear low
waisted jeans I've been wearing highway
15 3 years and years and years now and
they've always been from Topshop but I
decided to switch it up a bit because
these look so much like the Johnny jeans
and they're stretchy again the highway
stared these are from a soft but from
boohoo from any sauce just like that
Phase II color they are so nice just all
the way down I think I might make luck
you say they have like tiny little slits
in it and there's another little slit
this side I think I'm gonna make the
slit submit bigger though so they're a
bit bigger on my knee because
the girl is a little bit stupid just
having like a tiny tiny little red so I
think I might make the rips a little bit
bigger if they suit me but yeah I love
beige jeans I've never seen that beige
jeans and River Island or Topshop before
so when I saw these online and they were
like stretchy and the material that I
liked I was like okay I'm gonna have to
purchase these the next thing that I got
they actually got from cult Beauty as we
don't have morphe here in the UK I got
this morphe palette which i think is the
350 morphe palette I might be wrong I'm
gonna link it down below I'm gonna make
everything I got down below I've got
this morphe palette with the most
beautiful colors this is just I just use
it there's so much like powder around it
it's just very autumnal it has like just
so many breads Burgundy's like orange
toned colors I absolutely love I saw
this palette straightaway and I was like
okay that is so me I need to get like
right now I really just like this
palette because it has so much glitter
in it and I love the burgundy and the
orange colors basically there's no I
could color in here but I would say I
wouldn't work and maybe that orange I
wouldn't work I can't actually remember
how much this was but I'm gonna link it
down below as I said know my favorite
thing in this entire horse oh my god
everybody this is so long I forgot this
is from 3rd Avenue but I got it from a
source again this is adorable now I know
what you got the dressing-gown but this
is kind of different because I would
wear this is just like for this maybe
with leggings on or jeans on I would
just like chuck it over let my clothes
it's not necessary like a dressing gown
where I've just got my PJs on I would
wear this like whenever just whenever
I'm cold kind of like jumper I can't
remember these Accord like a sash
assure oh no that's wrong that is
totally wrong I don't really know what
this is called I'm gonna put this on for
you because I love it thank you
is it this bear I don't know what to
call it I really don't know what to call
it because I don't actually know what
it's called but look how fluffy it is
you just put it over you it's so warm it
literally the flop is to die for it has
pockets in it and it's really long as
well and it's possibly the confÃ­a thing
that i've ever
my entire life and ah if you haven't got
this I don't know how I lived about this
honestly I really don't because I know I
will be wearing this pretty much 24/7
like if I could go out with this like to
town or something I would I know I can
we look a little bit weird but if I
could I for sure would go out in this
it's just so comfy and it's adorable I'm
possibly one of the best things I think
I have ever bought they also have a like
a sparkly light pink on as well and it's
so cute it doesn't have like it's not
like the bear which is probably furred
this one because it goes nicely with my
socks like how well do they go look how
cute and the final thing that I actually
got was this matte lipstick that I have
been looking for for ever and this is
Lady be good I actually saw Emily Canham
have it and the second I saw her I was
like oh my goodness I'm in love with
that color I searched up googled
everywhere trying to get it and it was
honestly sold out everywhere they do be
good it's like a very nudie Coralie
color i'll place it on my hand and
swatch it for you guys it's just like
that really really nudie but like with a
tin of coral on it and it's it's a
really really pretty color and I know
that I will wear it
ahead of a lot and also I love the matte
packaging for these lipsticks as well I
just think they are so pretty wise I
might be in a different position right
now hope because I actually just like
engine of my whole video and for some
reason it just won't really flourish and
I'm reforming it and I got my little
fluffy thing that I don't even still
know what it's called on but yeah I hope
