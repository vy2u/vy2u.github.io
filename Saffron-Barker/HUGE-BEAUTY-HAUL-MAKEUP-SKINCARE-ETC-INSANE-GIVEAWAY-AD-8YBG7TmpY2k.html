channel oh my goodness have I missed
doing horse yes I have I don't think it
was that long ago that I'd done a hole
but it definitely was a long time ago
that I did actually do a beauty haul on
my channel so I am so so so so excited
for today's video
so basically I have collaborated with
one of my favorite sites Beauty Bay
which I'm sure you guys have heard me
talk about like literally a ton of times
on my lawns and stuff basically isn't on
my website that literally sells
everything beauty from like hair
products to like Beauty blenders to
actually everything you could ever think
of beauty basically so I've teamed up
with them and I have bought a ton of
stuff I've kind of got a little bit OTT
but there were just so many products
just reaching out to me on the site that
I just really wanted to get my hands on
like I just you know it's the new gear
and I just felt like I just wanted to
get rid of like my old stuff that's just
like too old and what head bar I just
wanted to get my hands on some new bits
you guys have been recommending stuff to
me so I kind of got a little bit of
everything and majority of his products
I actually have tried before as well and
they'll like my favorite products of all
time so the most exciting thing about
this video I'm only gonna be giving
every single thing away so one of you is
gonna be lucky enough to win everything
so if you are the chance of winning
everything to just stick around to the
end of the video so you can actually
find out on how to enter but I really
hope you guys do enjoy special a big
thumbs up subscribe down below and
without further ado what was that all
about let's get into the video the video
you know me love the camera this little
person here it's part of Maisie vlogs
we've got a club we Club in she's so
happy about collabing so one day I went
a little over the top
I mean heck yeah why don't you order
anything from Gucci Bay they always send
it in these boxes and like I just love
them so much there's way better than
packaging that just gets wasted has to
throw in the bin basically I've got to
literally gigantic boxes and I could not
like to talk in so the first thing that
I got was these new me hair
straighteners so basically new me I've
heard so so so many people talk about
this hair brand and
I've never tried anything from them
before I have friends that have these
and honestly like they swear by their
making they're amazing I'm really really
hoping so but I need new straight this
so bad and they are so nice how amazing
is this design they had a couple of
other prints as well I can't watch the
other ones were but these ones honestly
I just fell in love with them straight
away so not only do they look amazing
hopefully they are amazing I'm so
excited about this like things like the
extra sticks what actually everything
Beauty just excites me so so so much so
that was a very first thing that I got
and hopefully one of you guys or will be
getting it's a lot of tissue paper
because there's just so much stuff next
product is actually my favorite beauty
product at the moment now I have spoken
about this on my vlogs because honestly
I'm using this every single morning this
is by Star skin which is actually a
company I had never heard of before
but basically this is a 7 in one miracle
skin mouse pad these pads are a massage
exfoliator toner moisturizer serum mask
and makeup primer and it doesn't
actually say that it does this policy
like it removes all of my makeup I'm not
even kidding this is the best thing
pretty much as you guys can see now what
you do it should kind of slot your
finger inside the pad and one side is
and it's foliate up so you kind of just
like wipe off everything that you've got
on your face and you don't get
spoliation so sometimes like really
uncomfortable like because they're kind
of like not painful but it's kind of at
the harsh feeling well they're really
really really gentle and then you just
dabbling with the towel and dry your
face and then you flip over the other
side of the pad and then on that side
it's a serum and then this serum can
also be used as a primer which is now
what I'm doing for my makeup and
honestly my makeup actually lasts so so
so much longer and I'm not even kidding
when I say that so this is like the best
product I have bought and then I also
got this one which I've never actually
tried before so this is by star skin and
this is a seven in one miracle skin mop
pad again but it's an overnight mark so
this is obviously gonna be a little bit
different I'm not too sure how this
works but again it does have the two
sides of the pad also
like the packaging how this is like dark
and that one's like bright and
refreshing but yeah I'm so so so excited
to try this so if you guys will follow
my blog then you'll probably see me try
this because hundred-percent gonna use
this tonight but everything I'm pulling
out are linked down below
you all okay right so some of the
youtube front up i've actually already
got this it's by the makeup brand of
Milani you know I've never actually
tried anything else from them before but
when I was just shopping on beautybay
one day I just happened to really like
this blush so I just bought it and it's
so so so good because it has a really
lovely like gold shimmer underneath the
blush and it's not kind of like too in
your face so this is in the shade don't
see pink this is a different color to
what I've tried before so I'm hoping
that I love it and then I did obviously
also get some more makeup in so I'm
gonna try and go through them quite
quickly because I have got a lot to go
through laura geller hi-def below so
this is a illuminator duo and I have
seen as so many people talk about this
on YouTube like a lot of my favorite
youtubers use this brand or goodness
especially a lot of American youtubers
so this is what the palette looks like
honestly I think it's absolutely
stunning this is like the most important
so I'm so excited and I just love the
little compact so much compacts alike my
favorite thing because I just love when
they have like a little mirror because
it's just amazing to take out you know
just like to slam it in your bag the
next two things I got are by Alex tardy
of Beverly Hills so now one of my
favorite things about beachy Bay is the
fact that you can get makeup that you we
can't actually get here in the UK
because obviously like well I mean you
can also get it shipped from other sites
but the customs are so so so expensive
so beauty Bay is the way to go guys so
the very first lipgloss I got by
Anastacio Beverly Hills it's actually
one that I'm wearing right now I'm
pretty much worth every single day so I
do own a lot of these I've always
haven't just stock up because it's just
my favorite thing
so this is in the shade toffee so if you
like the shade that I'm wearing right
now then you're gonna love this
honestly that formula is the best thing
ever when it comes to the glosses
in fact so that maps as well I've never
actually seen this color before but I
just really liked online so this color
here is called Amber is this a gloss
yeah this is the glasses wow this is
pretty similar but it's a little bit
more orangie tone and I think this also
looks so pretty so very very very
excited to give that a go oh my goodness
I'm so excited right now because
honestly I'm just like stocking up on
everything I then it got a Beauty
Blender now I wanted to give the orange
one just because I've never had the
orange one before do you really want to
go face it with the pink Beauty Blender
because I've owned like a thousand of
them so I thought I'd be adventurous and
I'd go for an orange one they have every
single color on the site I've had the
black one the new one and the pink one
so kind of a goin down line another
product that I decided to treat myself
with was by new me again so this is a
hairdryer and I do not you forget to
mention at that new me is actually
exclusive to Beauty Bay which is so cool
there is actually quite a few brands
that's actually exclusive to them so
that's really cool so let's open this up
this is the first time I've seen this I
love this again I love the color so
basically I chose this right Ballu
hairdryer is actually on the turquoise
color but I've genuinely thought it was
so cool and like I I just know this
hairdryer is gonna be amazing because
again I've just heard so many people
talk about they're so I know I'm just
gonna be so excited to blow dry my hair
necks because pretty much like you have
to use what I use pretty much a
hairdryer every single day because I'm
always going to the gym and having to
wash my hair I pretty much do wash my
hair too much so always blow drying it
so I'm pretty excited about a new hair
dryer so that is very very very exciting
and it has to I don't know what these
are called what's this called on the
front of a hair dryer I'm not actually
sure if you guys go let me know down
below
so the next thing I haven't actually
ever tried before never had anybody talk
about this again it's by the brand star
skin now the reason I got this was just
because there were so many products on
this side by star skin and just because
I love those pads so much I thought I
would give something else ago so these
are plumping in hydrating at second skin
and lip mask so I just thought wanted to
see id so be so grateful when I'm on the
plane and stuff because I'm going on
quite a few holidays soon so I thought
on the plane as my skin just dry out
quite a lot and while I'm like flying
and stuff I thought these would be
really really really great plus I love
like you ever had those lip glosses
before like when they pump your lips and
like they feel like whoo I'm like tingly
I'm really hoping this does that to my
lips because I love that feeling so much
so I am excited to try these I want to
see how they look like I wondered that
actually lip shapes or they're just like
a little surf with hat oh I can't oh
yeah is a lip shape oh I should open one
up this is what the packaging looks like
and then apparently is actually a lip
shape so hopefully this is really good
again obviously I'll update you if these
are good but I'm sure they will be just
because a brand so far has honestly
blown me away
I then it got some tweezers which might
seem quite boring to some of you guys
but honestly these excite me so much I
honestly remember when I used to not
actually do YouTube myself
I used to see so many people talk about
tweezers like different youtubers and it
is a thick why until they care so much
about buying tweezers but honestly if
you guys were false eyelashes a lot then
you will know so you need a good pair of
tweezers and this brand is honestly
amazing
oh we're upside down sorry about that
this is by tweezerman then next up guys
we've got some last little bits so this
is oh this I'll say yeah hang on wait
let's open this up so basically I'll see
is another exclusive brands that I've
seen so many different like youtubers
and influences and like celebrities and
stuff talked about I know that Jackson
Hill talks about this brand a lot so I
just really wanted to give it a go
myself look oh my goodness
though this is
hey I shadow Pikmin and honestly I'm
gonna play some of my hand for you like
is that is that not absolutely mental
that is the most beautiful thing I have
ever seen in my life and that's
literally just like a tap I want to see
if I can get the most amazing looks with
this like literally from that little tap
I just like to rub on my hand and
it's like the best thing I've ever seen
in my life and let me know as well if
you guys have like ever bought that
brown before because obviously I've
never actually tried it myself but it
does look insane and let me know as well
if you've ever ordered from beautybay
before because I'm intrigued right so
we're moving on to the second box we
might just be halfway I don't know if
I'm gonna do this it's just packaging
after packaging after packaging right
this is another product that I got from
LC that I just really wanted to try the
packaging is amazing and loving the gold
this is a eyes shadow palette so
obviously if you guys can see the colors
are so nice and I really really really
wanted to get this palette because I
just felt like these were cool colors
I'd actually use like you know sometimes
when you get like a really nice palette
but then there's just like some colors
that you won't use like they're know for
a fact that I'll use every single one of
these colors so I'm super excited to
give that a go again loving the fact
that it's a compact and it does have the
mirror inside right right right so we're
just getting exciting now okay okay okay
I am buzzing for this zoeva I have never
ever ever owned a zoeva palette before
but honesty my best friend Anastasia I
think she has every single one of their
palettes and every single time like I'm
with her I'm always just so borrowing
them and using them and I'm always like
I really want to get one like what
happened I might just go out and
purchase one myself so I thought I'll go
for the whole lot so they actually do a
three in one set now you can't actually
buy these separately on the side but I
decided to go all out because I wanted
them for so long
let's have a look at this I can't
believe I'm actually just done this a
proper splurged so we've got cacao blend
we've got caramel is it milenge malate
I don't know how you pronounce this one
I'm sorry guys and then the third and
final one that we got is blank fusion I
love love love this yellowy gold color
so so much
I did get this a big set from you today
this is by unicorn a cosmetic and look
how cute the boxes I love it is so
pretty I've tried the Unicorn
lashes before and honestly they are so
so so amazing they're like really fluffy
and light on your eyes and they're just
overall look so pretty but they do also
do some really cool other products I'd
never tried before so I've got a bunch
of their brushes that's inside here are
different brushes guys go inside the
boxes world came this little stand and I
just thought oh my goodness yes I need
to get it so I'm really really really
excited because obviously I love the
lashes that I've said and I've never
tried the brushes and yet it came with
this stand and I just thought this was
gonna look so cute on my side so I'm
just so excited to just put this there
and put all the brushes up oh my god
that's so cute
the fact that like mermaid shape it's
just the best thing I've ever seen I
then I've got these a bath salts I'm so
excited for because if you guys again
follow me Allah then you will know that
I am obsessed with having baths at the
moment you guys cause like you know in
New Year's resolutions I've really been
like active like into the gym then when
I get back more just like so exhausted I
just want to cheer like have a nice bath
and like when you have a nice bath with
like really nice things it's just it's
the best thing ever you know it's like
you can't treat yourself more than a
good old bath so I got these baths so
really excited as well because not only
is there literally so much in here
because look how big it is like you're
comparing to my face size it's literally
huge of this bag I think the customer
may need I still never get different
color ah let's have a look you yes it
says it goes pink and shimmery so that's
exciting
and then from because this is oh this is
by the brown pod and then I do also get
another product so then I also got the
mermaid shimmer sorbet and then I got
this body pret scrub which is pink soul
and coconut so excited there's actually
one last thing to finish off the whole I
did get so I've just noticed at the very
bottom of this box so this is my Anasazi
art Beverly
so this is the brow powder duo so for me
I don't actually what I'm not really a
fan on like cream brow products I just
don't really work that well for me
because I just thought like you take
such a long time to get really strong
pigment so I actually think that powder
is so much better and I have tried the
anistar Co dip brow no it is good don't
get me wrong but I actually love this
brow powder so much more I've been
actually tried the one from Anasazi ah
but I just prefer brow powders so I got
this one and I'm really excited to give
