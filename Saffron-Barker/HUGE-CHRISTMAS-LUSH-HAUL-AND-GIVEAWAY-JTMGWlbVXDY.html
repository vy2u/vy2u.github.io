so I hope you guys are just as excited
as I am because today I have a huge
Christmas lush haul so today I actually
went into lush and I spent far too much
I bought all of my favorite Christmas
products in the lush door and I have a
well over time so if you guys want to go
check that out like if you guys wanna go
see me actually like buy and look around
lush then I do actually daily vlog and
my daily vlog will be linked down below
to go check the house in today's video
as I said I have loads and loads and
loads of products that I want to talk
through for me I think lush really come
out during Christmas I think it's
they're like the best time of year
because they have so many amazing
products and so many extra products that
they bring out especially for Christmas
and also I really hope this video helps
you guys out with maybe some gifts ideas
during Christmas for your friends your
family I know I would definitely be
getting some of these for my friends or
my family as I do actually think boss
products are great to give this gift so
without further adieu I feel like I've
already rambled on farty March smash
alike and let's get into this video so
of course I'm going to start off with my
all-time favorite bath balm and this is
peepin Santa this is a 395 and this has
always been my favorite bath um just
because it is so freaking and adorable
and to me it kind of smells like
different berries like raspberries and
strawberries this has to be one of my
favorites have to include this first
because it's just so freaking cute and
you can't not fall in love with this
bath bomb especially if you love
Christmas how much more Christmassy can
you get than this bath bomb yeah can so
there you go oh okay I just realized
actually that the eyes were in the wrong
place so I've now just moved them down
it was actually Santa with eyes on its
head but now it's actually back to keep
in Santa oh this one I'm so excited
about as well okay this one I don't know
if they had this last year this is the
first year that I've actually got this
and it's a dinosaur with a Santa hat on
and it's
would santa Soros I mean how adorable is
this I love this and it's a bubble bath
you can use this more than once it's
reusable so it's great because it's not
literally money just down the drain you
can reuse this again and again and again
also with this the whole bar as well as
having a musky and light scent it also
turns the bathwater like that deep green
color so it's like equal yellow dinosaur
bar which is really adorable and this
was I believe 595 I'm so excited about
this because I actually tried this on in
the shop today and I fell in love
straight away so Snow Fairy snow berry
is actually the most so product in lush
I got told that when I have my talk
around the lush store
it's a really really sweet scent if you
guys love sweet scents you're going to
love this for sure it's a very popular
scent I honestly love it it is amazing
and I've used the shower gel loads I
tend to buy the shower gel all of the
time but I never actually got my hands
round to buy in this body conditioner
until this morning and I've already
fallen in love this body condition is
great because you don't have to
moisturize when you get out of the bath
you just do it in the bar but then you
wash it straight off after and it leaves
your skin feeling smooth and gray and it
smells divine
alfe on the Shelf and now I've never
actually got my hands on this before
this was in their finest section and
this basically is just like play-doh is
how I would describe it it has like all
the alpha colors hence why is Christmas
themed but this I think is definitely
aimed a younger children it's just to
play with in the bath so if you guys
this gets like distracted easily then
this is great and also it is shampoo and
body shampoo as well so you can wash
your body with this as well as having it
for fun and it lasts ages as well this
was by far my favorite body lotion this
one's good sleepy 7 best-selling body
lotion as well it's very strong it
smells like lavender
however it smells completely different
when you actually put it on your skin it
said in the pot which sounds really
weird but it's a lot stronger when you
put it over your body again image
skin feel amazing and it's really
hydrating as well so yeah love this one
as well the smell is amazing really oh
my god Wow Wow
I have pins and needles and they are
freaking killing me because they'll come
back in the ice bath again this bubble
bar is definitely a winner for me one
first thing about it
it looks adorable secondly it's amazing
inmates your skin feels so smooth it was
a 395 I believe and it also creates a
loads of bubbles in the bar which I
absolutely love because they love a good
old bubble bar also after I use this my
entire upstairs smelt of this it's such
a beautiful and scent and it's not too
strong as well it's really refreshing
and it has a little I would say it's
more of a sweet scent as well but yeah
it's gorgeous really cute and this is
definitely a bum bar that I would
recommend Santa's belly now this is
actually a shower jelly which I've never
actually come across before until I went
into lash I've never used a shower jelly
before I don't mean how cute is it
literally in Santa's belly and again
it's reusable because you can just
either take off chunks at a time or you
can use it as one whole and just scrub
around your body and this feels amazing
I would describe it as Cola and apples
it's very a like refreshing smell and
it's so much fun to play with in the
bath it's great at washing your body
again it makes your skin feel really
smooth and also of you guys like your
bath looking amazing as well this also
leaves like lots of sparkles and like
little stars in the bath as well so it's
really nice and yeah your skin looks
really glowing as well because you kind
of get like sparkle was like all over
your body as well Northern Light I love
this far from this bath bomb is the
prettiest thing when it goes in the bath
it literally
functional online it has so many
different colors in it and I just think
it looks so pretty I love how the bar
form is shaped the great thing with this
bath bomb is it's so awesome when you
put it in the bath it like spins around
and it like fizzes and yeah it just
creates this amazing look also a post
set it's got a really original scent
it's scented with flower jasmine and in
yangyang so I love this one I definitely
think this is one to try if you guys
haven't tried a bath but before just
because it's really cool and it creates
so many different and wonderful colors
in the bath so I definitely think it's
one to pick up this is another home
jelly this is the snowman jelly and the
reason I picked this one up as well as
you can tell looks oh God
exactly like a snowman the reason I
picked this one up is because when I
went to lush a couple of weeks back in
London on Oxford Street
I actually made these snowman jellies I
made it with the people who work in lush
and I filmed it over on my daily
vlogging Channel so I can't with a
hundred of these were often made for me
so go me I will link down the vlog where
I actually made them and you can see me
make them but yeah it was so weird
because it's supposed to have that
carrot smell as well we actually like
grated carrot like real Cara it was so
cool how we made them so if you want to
go see that I'm going to link that book
down below oh my god
look it's like everywhere we've been
playing with it oh it smells just
amazing though next up I've got the
classic
Snow Fairy this is actually Russia's
most sold product in the store this
shower gel is very popular and I can
definitely see why because it smells
amazing it's a really really sweet and
strong scent so if you guys love
showering with more sweeter Sens then
you will for sure love this I think
anybody that's already shocked at lash
would have definitely tried this because
it's so popular it is actually only
around during Christmas hence why I
actually got the biggest bottle there is
there was three different sizes
and of course I have to pick up the
biggest one because I'm obsessed with
this and I love love love sweet scents
so this is one that I personally know
again another classic this is candy cane
Mountain this smells a lot like Snow
Fairy even though I would say it's more
intense it's a lot stronger than snow
very it's really creamy when in the bath
again is another bubble bar so it's
reusable so if you love Snow Fairy
you're going to love this one it's
basically the same thing that creates
bubbles so I love this one and again I
think it looks really pretty as well
Stardust this bath bomb I would describe
it as a vanilla scent when you put it in
the bath it also goes like it smells
really strong like vanilla and also the
bath water goes very milky and again if
you kind of like a little bit of sparkle
it has like little stars in the water as
well so I think it's a really beautiful
one and I think this is great for all
ages as well I think like my mom would
personally love this one as it's so
simple and it has such a gorgeous smell
as well that again leaves your entire
house smelling amazing oh my goodness I
adore this bath bomb simply because of
the colors there such vibrant colors
it's called that really bright sky blue
with gold that I think goes really
nicely and gorgeous together and once
you put this in your bath firstly it's
had your bath water to the most amazing
color ever and also is like fizzes up as
well so it's really fun in the bath and
looks really cool again again smells
amazing just like all the others and
yeah this is a really gorgeous one and
it's called it shoots four stars this
one's a little bit of a weird one but I
do also love the sound of this now this
is very Duff dusting powder again smells
are just like Snow Fairy and this you're
supposed to actually like sprinkle on
your bed sheets before you go to bed
it's supposed to help you relax and to
help you sleep also you can put it over
your body and use as shimmer that's what
I go to when I was in the store and just
because it looks really pretty when it's
on your body
them so if you just rub this around you
get like a really nice shimmer and
sparkle I think this is meant for a lot
of different uses and so I need to quite
work out exactly what I would use this
for I know I would definitely sprinkle
this on my bed cheese so yeah it's a
little bit of a weird one but I do love
the sound of it so I'm excited to
actually try this out for myself not
gonna lie I simply got this bath bomb
but just for the packaging because how
adorable is it it's a little sprout it's
cool little sprout and it's amazing it
smells like it smells like apples but it
does also have a Barger Mott and Rose
scent in it as well yes to me smells
like apples but it's a gorgeous scent
also they do a Satsuma one which looks
very similar apart from it has like an
orange scarf and with you scarf you can
use them as a scarf you can use it to
like repackage something or pretty much
use it for whatever you want but I think
this is just a lovely gift as it looks
so cute as well also great stocking
filler bubbly so this shower gel smells
exactly like a buzz fizz it's a bond
service breakfast boost pad full of
sweet orange oil and fresh grape juice
to help the morning go off with a bang
or should that be a pop that's what it
says on the front the lip scrubs in
large to actually the best tip scrubs
that I think I've ever honestly tried
just because firstly they're amazing
because they smell insane Santa baby is
my favorite one that I've ever had so I
had to pick up another one this year
it's a nice ready color and feels
absolutely amazing on your lips also
because it's made oh I've got some ones
hanging off the edge also because it's
made out of like all natural ingredients
it's also editable like you can eat this
but like literally don't do what I done
last year when I had this I literally
was scooping out and eating it it's like
pure sugar this sort of smells amazing
tastes amazing and it's great for your
lips as well so you really can't not and
also it does last ages as well so I got
Santa Baby and then again
sugarplum fairy which smells a lot well
actually it smells like Snow Fairy but
with a tint of like
great this is another reusable bubble
bar this for starters looks so pretty I
think it's so gorgeous and I love little
bow that has on it as well so yeah as I
said it's reusable so it's it's
basically your equivalent to Snow Fairy
and apart from it made sure bar very
bubbly because it's a bubble bar and
also it's reusable so it's great and
it's a really popular one in lush not
really much to say about this one it's
for the Christmas and it smells gorgeous
another really nice bath bomb that I
think is great for a Christmas gift
because as you can tell is very
Christmas related as its father
Christmas and smells really gorgeous I
think it's a great gift also a great one
to have at home if you guys are having
like a Christmas pamper evening you want
to get in the Christmas zone then and
this is a great one to have that this is
perfect for your Christmas night pamper
evening gold in a wonder again this is
another really popular lush bath bomb
this is a golden present which actually
inside is like this bright blue
turquoise kind of color and turns your
bath a bright blue turquoise color yeah
it's really gorgeous inside the bath
also like fizzes up and leaves a lot of
glitter so if you guys are the one who
ends up cleaning the bath after you have
a bath then you might have loved this
one so much because it takes quite a
long time to scrub it all out as there
is so much glitter with this bath bomb
but it doesn't really pretty and
personally I do love this bath bomb so
I've saved the best for last
and this is the snow angel bath mount I
never actually tried a bath mount out
before until I tried this one and it is
gorgeous
Aleut your skin feeling really smooth
it's really moisturizing and it kind of
like to me it has the scent is like a
cross between play-doh and marzipan but
it does smell amazing and the back is
gorgeous as well just because it's
really shimmery and glittery on the back
so this one I would actually say is
definitely in my top 5 favorites and
obviously it's an angel and of course
yes I love angels so yeah love this one
love love love there it was that one
was everything that I actually bought
from Lashley's worth I was good to my
