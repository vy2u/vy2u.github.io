so today I am giving you guys a hoe and
this is a summer haul because I have
been summer shopping because my holiday
is in a week and a half now I'm going to
LA on the 21st for VidCon so I am so
excited for that so I had to get so many
summer clothes okay maybe I didn't have
to but I wanted to get so many summer
clothes for it so that is what I've done
yeah everything here is clothes or shoes
or accessories is one thing that isn't
but I'll show you that pretty obvious
that it isn't but yeah so I'm so excited
to film this video I'm actually so
surprised how requested this video was
because I tweeted it like doing a poll
on my Twitter my Twitter fine stuff I've
got a little promo there and this video
got 1500 more bows than the other video
that I was gonna do so I was like well
I'm going to have to do this right now
I'm so excited to do this video because
honestly haul videos are my favorite
videos to do and to watch like I enjoy
watching them so much so really hope you
guys enjoyed this video basically I went
on a London shopping trip so pretty much
all of its from London I've got a few
bits from a few online shopping sites
apart from that I got most of it London
so I hope you guys enjoy this video
mashup big thumbs up if you guys do and
if you want to see more haul videos and
let's get into this video the first I
juice wasn't the first one too but it
was one or so I'm not really gonna do in
any particular order but oh my goodness
I have been obsessing over these sandals
I've been one to the wear them for so
long I'm gonna wear them tomorrow
because I'm going to summertime balls
I'm so excited and I'm going to wear
these basically I saw these in Brighton
but they didn't have my size I was so
upset and I saw them in London and I was
so happy that they have my size I'm a
size 6 so I grabbed them they are so
pretty there just like a suede greyish
colour they've kind of got that like
light blue color to them they also have
them in black and brown as well but they
are so gorgeous I love them so much I
just love all the straps they got up
your leg but just like the tiniest bit
and yeah these are from River Island and
these are 30 pounds and I just love and
I cannot wait to wear them so I dunno to
get some London
I got this one boo hoo but it is so
gorgeous and this is like this tropical
like skin-tight dress it's kind of like
a bodycon dress it is so beautiful and I
just love it so much as well but it's so
flattering like personally anything and
its really good like I was so scared to
try on books I was like this could be so
flattering this dress because it's like
it's very sure and it's very skin tight
but it's really flattering and I just
love it so much it's definitely got that
summer vibe to it it was 15 pounds which
is not a lot because if you went to
someone like Topshop it will be a lot
more so yeah I love this so much and I'm
so glad that I got it because I would
definitely be wearing it in LA and Vegas
so when I went to London the first shop
I went into Wars Urban Outfitters and if
it does so many things I've tried them
all on expectant looks like good and
they just didn't look good they were
just so unflattering or they just wasn't
nice
this was the only thing that I ended up
getting from there but I love it it's
like a washed out dark grey dress it has
like the cutout shoulders but it still
has like short sleeves you can put about
round it and like double it over which
is what I think I'm going to do but it's
not too long so you definitely can just
wear it like shift dress it was 32
pounds it's quite on the expensive side
you probably could go somewhere else and
find something very similar for a lot
cheaper but I just love this so much and
it's so comfy as well so I got to buy
the only things I left in the bag flashy
car now I actually got one about to pull
out this bag a year ago like in
different colors they're like the
tiniest bit different but they were from
barcia car and they were very similar
but I got them in different colors this
time I got a car key green colour
because I am obsessing over car key
green as you guys can tell because I
think we're wearing it I love a lot but
it's just such a gorgeous crop top
because it has the cops everywhere it
has the cops both sides the cuts in the
middle and then it's got like it's quite
low rides at the front are then clearly
a cop the other side I don't think it
was much at all yeah it was $7.99 so it
really wasn't expensive and then I also
got it in red as well which is just so
pretty
is such like a summary color I love reds
and pinks and greens and summer so that
was me sorted and then another thing
from boohoo I got the most gorgeous
color can I just say this got and it's
like a poppy color it's so beautiful
it's so flattering it's really kicks it
has a pocket there as well j-just think
gives that kind of like extra touch
ticket makes it look more expensive but
that makes sense but yeah this was ten
pounds so it definitely was a bargain
but I know if I went to a shop globe
over island or Topshop it would be a lot
more so yeah I love this so much it's so
summery gives me the summary fab so I
love Primark so the one thing I didn't
get which was clothes but I do have
about 100 of these I got the most
adorable cuts oh my god they are so cute
so this one says no bad vibes and then
this one says a hundred percent thirsty
but I just loved the gold tops it was
like I don't know and have one's really
really similar to these but they don't
have the gold tops so the fact they had
the gold tops I was like okay I'm just
gonna have to get them there were three
pound each so they wasn't really that
expensive uh-oh I forgot I got something
else River Island as well so I got this
top here that I just had to get because
it says LA on it come on I'm wearing
this in LA I got this top from
River Island and it was 14 pounds and I
got it in size 8 another thing I got
from Primark words at this crop top and
it was only 5 pounds I thought why not
bargain is really cute I love stripes at
the moment and I actually saw this on
somebody else's channel by Karan burr
who's somebody I subscribed to done a
Primark call and I saw that I was like
oh my god need to get done I go to
London because the Primark and Brighton
really isn't very good so the second I
thought I was like yeah I'm gonna get
that and I knew it'd look good on
because I saw like the quality knit
really good I can't even remember his
video I was on but yeah grab this oh I'm
not too sure about this I ordered this
and it looks so much better on the model
than on myself it's like a very very low
the cutout bralette and I got it in the
size 8
and then it kind of like I don't know if
it crosses over yeah it crosses over you
kind of like put your belly free there
that makes sense is really hard to show
really weird though they gave me two and
I only ordered one and I double-checked
the receipt to see if I accidentally
ordered two and had only ordered one and
they Val given me two I don't even know
if I like ya very loud shop I went to I
have no idea how to pronounce it and I
am the worst at pronouncing things as
you guys know follow my cooking channel
all the time I'm trying to show you guys
who do things I got and then they just
can't pronounce it I think it's called
ten no teza net I feel safe announcer is
probably wrong but if the larger I went
into I was like very undecided what to
go into it because like I never been in
it before the hut I went in there and
the first thing I saw I picked up and it
was there's a cocky green bikini it has
like I don't know it kind of has like a
netting on the top of it it's just so
pretty I just love cocky and as I said
like a hundred times
and then the bottoms I got to go with it
I'm really really cute as well they have
like the three straps out but yeah I
really really like this I'm really glad
as well because the one thing I said to
myself I'm going to get in London was of
a cleaning and I could find a nice on
this one was $12.99 and it's good as
well because it has like some padding in
it I hate wearing bikinis I don't have
padding they just looked over how to me
and then bottoms were $9.99 hey so
moving on to shoes I actually got three
more pairs of shoes which is very bad
but I got these Nike slip ons from ASOS
actually they were 17 pounds I've got
them yesterday I was so happy I was over
the moon because I was going to get them
in London because they had them in the
night store was very undecided between
the Nike and Adidas ones but I decided
to get 9 I was going to get them once in
London but I had already been there
hours and I just like oh like I need to
go home now it's all them on a sauce so
I got them from their necks a delivery
I'm so happy about this purchase because
they are so comfy I'm gonna be wearing
them just like in dogs or slippers
because they are so comfy and I just see
they look for any really cool I think
I'm gonna order the black as well
because I just really like
them so yeah that's my happen I don't
know how I haven't told you guys already
so a long time ago me my boyfriend we
went to Westfield and we saw these shoes
and Urban Outfitters and I was really
undecided whether to get them like I
loved them so much but they were just
like so expensive like it's just like
another 55 pounds and I was like I need
to sort spending money and the second I
got a job I regretted it so bad because
I'm a vintage and I couldn't find them
anywhere else they didn't have them on
the Urban Outfitters website and I was
thought so but anyway I went into Top
Chef in London actually top man and they
told me it was the last pair left that
they had and they actually had these
shoes I was so happy you guys might
think okay you're overreacting they're
just like paint shoes but I love my
shoes so they are these vintage a DDoS
trainers I think they're called
white-hot vintage yeah court vintage re
des trainers I just they kind of remind
me of like old school they're so cute is
the holes that they haven't course
decided and if you guys can see there
but I just think they just look so cool
and I'm not wearing them until I go away
because I don't want to get them the
tiniest bit dirty I'm so bad with shoes
I get them so dirty so quickly so yeah
I'm hoping my wine which will go away
but I know them so much I've said that
were everything I was
the most beautiful dress ever this like
literally guess how much this was in the
Commons before you say like guess now
how much is dress was this dress here
look how beautiful it is white and gold
just go amazing together I just think it
is such a pretty dress and it's body con
and it's really really short but it's
kind of hard to show you I hope you
right so inc in the comments this dress
was actually 18 pounds and I personally
think it looks it could look like a
hundred pounds so if somebody told me
that 100 pounds I'd be like oh yeah fair
enough like that looks like it eighteen
pounds from through her this is the most
gorgeous dress another thing I got from
River Island are these white shorts now
it was actually my mom who pretty
convinced me to get these because I only
ever wear Topshop gene and Topshop
shorts because I just don't think any
others look factoring on me and then my
mum said to me oh I've saw really really
nice shorts in River Island knows that
no not me she's like no Stefan can you
just try them on please so I tried them
on and I'm so glad that I did because
well I got them but they are really
really flattering actually I really like
them and they were 30 pound forever
island they're just like plain white
ripped shorts but I just think yeah
they're really nice and then also for
them this is going to be so weird like
trying to show you like this so it's
just like a normal plain black crop top
but then this kind of like goes up like
here and then it like goes around your
neck like that I thought they said it's
just like plain black and then it has
that collar was 14 pounds and I actually
got it in size 6
it comes up quite big so if you're going
to get this top I would recommend to get
the size down because it does come up
very big but yeah I just think that's
really trendy and really cool yeah so
that is everything for my all today I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know if you want me to do more horse
because I want to do more so please tell
me that you want me to do more because I
love doing hauls it kind of gives me a
reason to spend money yeah so hope you
