here firstly I'm going to show you which
is so adorable are these Minnie Mouse
slide on pumps that one of these the
second I saw these I was like yes yes
yes yes that is being all over you guys
know that I literally love the painting
and I literally love Mickey and Minnie
Mouse so much so I couldn't resist
finding these these were ten pounds
which I thought was pretty much a
bargain for a pair of shoes it's very
cool I know I went into lockers slide
ons as well they're so easy to wear and
ultimately County as well so everything
about these are like yes these are
absolutely gray also I think I'm going
to get some really cute pictures with
you as well I love like the street or
mini heads on the side I loved it for
solos as well I think I'll make some
look super cool so I picked up these ten
pounds bargain
buzzer next up you guys know that I love
camo so it can resist also I'm guessing
this so this is a camo jacket classic
shirt it's more like this charity
material so this was an absolute bargain
this was 14 pounds now as you have so
many jackets very similar to this but I
paid so much more than 14 pounds like I
say jackets so similar to this from
Topshop and policy is about 65 pounds so
this was an absolute bargain I loved it
also I love how like elasticated it is
on the bottom as well which is really
nice and I love the buttons that go down
as well even though probably or how big
like more for sure like I've done quite
a lot then just maybe have like oh no
they're kind of like a plain top
underneath I think I look pretty cool so
yeah I can visit from getting this
because I thought it was very affordable
and I love come on I love this jacket
shelf is like this through my thighs
also I picked up these and Mason free
shorts that I thought were pretty pretty
they're going to be so pretty in the sky
master - collide springtime also but
there's that really cute with my minimap
shoes as well it's kind of like planning
a whole I had like a vision of a whole
outfit in my head and this was part of
it yeah so I not be sure it's also what
I love about
Israel asked okay kids so they're really
easy and super comfortable to wear and
they're like a parent you know Jen in
short it's going to a lover and get in
short if you're like having a beach day
where you're at the pool or on holiday
and you just want to slide on some
shorts like putting denim shorts that
are just so uncomfortable where are
these not only do they look pretty that
also really comfortable as well so I
picked up these and these were eight
pounds now we're turning into spring my
next item is littering perfect for
spring so first room so is this like
bright like hot pink jumper dress which
is really nice because it's not too sick
it is a really really nice cutting
material and obviously spring is coming
over awkward stage it's like to wear a
jumper and be too long or do you where
you don't want to orchestrate a bit even
though it's like a thin jumper it's also
quite short as well so I thought it was
perfect for spring I love the color
reminds me of my Barbie which I love
so everything about this I love and what
she thought I was I mean I would wear
this with trainers but usually this is
like sand or maybe even a short little
booth I think we also have really cubed
this as well right so much typewriting
guys how cute is that I thought this
hair wrap because I can with it although
actually I have been looking by era like
I know it's kind of a weird thing to
play look around Bob well have I been
missing for one because when I wash my
face I hate to my hair goes sweat and
like you go to bed like it's just space
water like what hair so I saw this
really adorable hair wrap and it was
Rampal 50 if you follow my god she would
definitely see me wearing this when I
wash my face and stuff well but turns
out the bomb no way right way
oh my goodness
/ cute it's even cuter than I actually
first imagined it to be I am NOT to be
bombing to remove my makeup so that I
can learn it now and forever wish
imagine that lasts because my hair is
like all over the place now but hey hey
let's move on the scenic you Michael I
don't hear or some really
and I actually got probably try a secret
pink and I think it was off about 65
pounds and he actually wasn't even as
nice we didn't have a whisker net so I
had to get this one again another
bargain that this was eight pound if you
were to get this somewhere like Topsail
Brother Island you'll be so much more
pricey so this is this a really thin
cropped hoodie now as you can see it's
like absolutely great kind of color and
what I really know about it as well is a
little like slips and rips on the slide
I think you just make them look pretty
cool and obviously I love the hood I
love hosts on my cropped who loves I
love it my style I would also exploit
the slits and stuff in the arms as well
which I think really cool again spring
coming up they already have a son out in
the UK which is absolutely amazing so I
had to pick out these sunglasses which
straightaway I was like oh my goodness
because I actually saw some really
similar a while back I brought us or
wore them to this day but now something
for this line I actually wanted some to
be ones that are about 300 pounds and
they are so similar to this so when I
saw this for a pound and sigmaz up 299
pounds I was like oh yes so yeah I
picked up these sunglasses which are
really nice they're kind of like a faded
pink like light pale pink colors and
outs because white underneath and I also
got this really cute as well because it
can be a little case as well and I
really like the whole packaging of how
it is I know so I love this both really
like it
guys like seriously these are a pound
one pound for verum sunglasses like that
is missionary amazing and they have so
many other styles as well
this was personally my favorite hence
why I picked it after there were so many
different styles and even though I
normally wear like a metal sunglasses
and this was a plastic I've always
wanted like a plastic hair just to wear
on the poor so that I don't ruin them so
yeah be straight away I was like yes yes
yes I mean you can wear a different pair
every single day and this price a pound
of course I'm going to show you guys
what in are everything from yellow now
or the heck you still eyes I know how
big they are even though like my room is
because it's so dark in here it's
right now but yes this is the let's put
them off I am actually dripping sweat
right now this bag looks like a backpack
but it's not because it actually has
weight handles on it and also I can draw
string bag which I literally love as
well I love the colors on this bag it's
currently green I love the mesh across
the front basically just listen for this
bag a lot every single thing about it
I would take you on holiday with me I
wish you to here at home I would take
you on holiday as me because this water
is what I've been water food is like is
that sort materials it's not going to
get ruined by water and obviously I
reduce it here at home as well I love
everything about this size it was my
house I don't know I'm going to get a
lot of use elements are probably going
to be a one of the best nine pounds I've
ever spent
next up I thought a bikini
obviously spring/summer collection I
love the color I love you guys know if
you watch a lot of my holes you'll know
that like by makini is honestly my
favorite thing ever of Appaloosas gets
me so excited I picked up this peachy
orange e bikini boys like a coral kind
of color which is so pretty I literally
love this color so much decided I'm
getting it on my nails next even though
the white at the women it's my next
color you do actually have to buy these
separately but it wasn't very pricey so
it's alright yeah I love it my love the
color I love the shape of it it's really
really comfortable to wear and a lot of
frills as well the throws are really
really pretty and then the bottoms as
well have like the throws at the sides
so the bottoms were full powers and then
their top was 6 pounds so 10 pounds in
total working out you guys it's a ghost
amass how to get out of my fam take so
my got some micellar cleansing water
this was 2 pounds I've never I've used
as the actual brand of this before and I
love it so much
a lot of this one was a lot more
affordable so I thought I might as well
give it a go and it comes in like quite
a big bottle as well like honestly the
broken luggage water
I thought I could never really goes to
absolute great so picked up this for two
pounds there's a trocar which I was
enough it was two pounds with the suede
material and then it has like these like
little silver bubbles on it it's like a
little bit thicker than normal total
data wherever I thought it's pretty cool
and it's two pounds of why not I also
got a Rolling Stones t-shirt which
allows so now I know you guys probably
know that I do have a lot of different
band t-shirts and I have been known in
the past of wearing a couple that I
don't even what I've omitted like I do
anything to know the band is warm
because it's like the t-shirt and that's
how it is hello the Rolling Stones I do
actually know I do actually really like
them I actually had a top like this
really similar when I was six years old
so I've won the Honan stones before and
I do enjoy them I do if you love them
and this was actually a really really
cool t-shirt so it's really cool on the
flyer and then on the back it has like
the tour dates and stuff which I thought
was very cool and I've got this for
eight pounds I mean even if you don't
know who the Rolling Stones are it
doesn't matter because overall I just
think it's a pretty cool t-shirt II a
little bit I've got I've got some types
because I'm going way to freedom to
follow the laws if you guys returns out
so I had to get some nice big tight but
actually was going to come from Primark
because they do the best type for the
cheapest product so I can have a video
these were three calls and said the
final thing that I got was these
necklaces that I thought were really
really firstly because not only I didn't
look so nice together but also I can
wear them all individually as well
I don't need never be really pretty and
these are three pounds and literally I
love wine jewelry as well I just don't
really feel like you can wear enough of
it I feel like I don't buy enough of it
and I thought you don't want you call my
knock over yeah these are these
necklaces where like gold and black it's
very pretty and that is the last thing
before very health by the way that is
everything for my private video ebook
always oxygen Sandra hundred pounds I
want to see things either bargain
because I do literally buy two jumpers
from someone on top shop and it's going
to cost me like a hundred pounds so
overall I thought this whole
always an absolute bargain and hopefully
