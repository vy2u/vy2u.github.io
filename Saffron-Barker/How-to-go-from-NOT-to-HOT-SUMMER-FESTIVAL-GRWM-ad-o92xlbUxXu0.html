the summer with me because in the UK
right now actually 30 degrees like what
the heck it never gets hot here so like
every English person is like freaking
the hell out hence why my body is like
sober right now fat as the English
weather does tend to just go f en SE all
the time it probably will be gone next
week so why not bring the summer with me
for this video and all of you guys been
missing out on the British weather then
oh yeah I brought it with me for this
video so yeah hi everyone and welcome
back to my channel I heard a little good
I hope you are having the best time
where we guys are in the world right now
so for today's video I'm going to be
doing a kind of like OOTD kind of like
get ready with me vibe you know hair
makeup outfit also I kind of want to
show you like my kit and things that I
won't be worth like a festival kind of
like for my recommendations for like say
pieces that will always be there in your
wardrobe that you can take to either
like a principal or a party so I hope
you guys enjoy watching if you do if you
smash a big like and also subscribe down
below if you guys haven't already and
finally let's get in to this video so
I'm going to start off with my kind of
like fashion and must-have things that I
would always have in my wardrobe for a
vegetable or for like a party so I'm
going to start off with quite obvious
one and this is Ingenium it shorts
always always always have a pair of
denim shorts because they are never
going to go outside or they were always
going to look good at either a festival
or a party my once I in love because
these ones are like frayed and I think
frayed are really cool they're kind of
making up with Eddie and rocky so I love
them and I really like the stuff from
them as well so I actually got these
denim shorts from I saw it first
brightly colored top yellow and actually
my favorite color at the moment so I've
got a yellow one if you've got a pair of
playing shop and you want to jazz them
up then I definitely would go for like a
chunky ball kind of like this one
I think it's a really great accessory
arjan shoes kind of like depending on
the weather
if it was a to heart a pair of my study
boots like there would always really
cool I love ankle boots and thoroughly
other stuffs online and recommend up
really edgy and that really cool vibe
again and if it was a little bit hotter
than however we go with more sandals
like this I really think the cross and
laces are really cool and edgy and cute
again and I think Blass was always a
great color of the shoe because you
can't really go wrong and it matches our
pretty much everything the last thing
that you want to do is be carry around
like a massive bag they'll be so
uncomfortable so I stayed above bags
gray I love these two these actually my
favorite at the moment and you can see
they're very different style but I think
they both look pretty cool I think the
best thing to have when going to a
festival to really stand out it's
definitely glitter so I have like tons
different like alyssa ports in my
wardrobe like all different colors and
these are just great because they're
really affordable they're so good at
festival and you can achieve sickness on
with hair gel and it looks so good and
last all day and also as well as glitter
I definitely think gems as well so these
are just some gems that I've recently
picked up you can get me from pretty
much like any high street store at the
moment they are really in fashionable
fact they've been in fashion for years
so again another statement that I would
always recommend as you can see I'm bare
face right now I'm going to start off
with a primer so I'm going to be using
it be a benefit Porefessional primer as
you guys know if you follow my blogs and
stuff you guys will know this is one of
my favorite primers ever it is amazing
and it definitely makes your makeup last
all day and also it feels so nice on
your skin so I'm just going to start by
applying this
honestly I recommend to this primer slow
so much because especially in the summer
when you are like sweating it will make
a makeup last all day and literally you
guys know it's my favorite primer of all
time like it does miracles for
foundation I'm going to be using the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation and mine
is in the shade are 370 now this is
honestly quite a new foundation I
haven't used it that many times oh good
again is quite good at making your
makeup last day so I'm just going to go
in with my Beauty Blender to use this
now the shows that I thought is actually
pinky toned and normally up so using a
yellow tone but actually the shade of
this foundation works really really
nicely wherever it burn I'm also going
to be applying a little bit on my neck
just to also make sure the foundation is
blended and to cover up the Millbrae
with the redness as well now my
foundation is done I'm going to be
moving on cue concealer I'm going to be
using it this concealer by a to fade and
this is the Born This Way concealer it's
so good because it's so like it's thick
but it's so creamy that it's so
plentiful as well so it's really good
and it's really high coverage as well so
I'm just really applying this on my skin
it you guys basically know the routine
by now again back in and with my Beauty
Blender
now my color point base is done I need
to set it so I'm going to be using it
the laura mercier setting powder this is
a may ring again I use this so much and
I'm not going to bake it if I'm honestly
just going to brush it on of my face
just in this highlighted point where I
actually put my concealer just to make
sure it's all set so this is super easy
and I'm not applying much on my face at
all sovereigns are I'm going to go in
and with one of my favs that this
bronzer literally works what everybody
is so so nice and as I want kind of like
a festival like kind of sunkissed look I
think this bronzer would be absolute
perfect for it and I completely forgot
to say I do actually have a discount
code for all these benefit products that
I'll be using throughout this videos I'm
going that on the screen and link it
down below but yeah this bronzer is
amazing and I love the fact it comes the
mirror inside so basically a better
contour is bed I love the shape so much
and how easy it is to blend so I'm just
going to apply this what I normally
would contour my face as I'm just going
to blend it in after honestly this
powder is amazing because it's just so
easy to blend and so beautiful at the
same time and definitely kind of gives
you that that sunkissed look at you
definitely with one out of festival
guys a learn how sun kissed my forehead
looks right now I am loving it I mean
I'm just going to blend in my cheekbones
then I'm going to blend in my jawline
but so far I'm actually loving this look
I think the bronzer has definitely made
it and look something something else can
I just say as well
I am so grateful I am so excited to be
working with benefit on this video
because honestly like especially the
bronzer one the primer and pretty much
everything I love a benefit as a brand
so much so I'm so happy to be working
with them on this video and I'm so happy
they get to give you guys a discount
code as well which is so awesome so yeah
okay this is pretty much the bronzer
done yeah
now our foundation was kind of like
fairly light I didn't want to apply too
much bronzer to my skin but as I said it
is super buildable so if you do want to
look the more bronze then you can
definitely work your way up on this
bronzer but now I'm going to go inward
wait where is that at whereas the earth
is a blush I've been using recently I
think I use it in my last video you
definitely would have seen this in my
vlog again it's actually by a benefit
this is what I've been newest blushes it
is such a pretty kind of like peachy
pink also have like the gold shimmer in
the middle as well which I just love so
kind of gives you that like highlighted
below as well which I also love so I'm
just going to apply this on my
cheekbones I want to understand how
people don't like to use blusher
sometimes because I think the luxury
looks so natural and especially in the
sunshine as well it is definitely major
of cheeks pop so I think blusher is so
so pretty and I love to apply quite a
bit of it this brush is comes out very
pigmented so as you can see I didn't
like literally popping anything on the
brush and my cheeks are pink and pop in
and yeah and now going to apply the
highlight which I'm pretty excited for
highlight now I'm going to be using also
one of my faves
is the mary-lou manizer by the balm now
the reason I haven't really gone too
much of my makeup so far is because I
want to wear a red lip and also as like
a festival and sub I want to wear Jen so
it's like about how like a really heavy
face it would look a bit too much but
for highlight again I'm just applying it
where I normally you guys again know
routine apply my highlighter this is
actually a really new thing for me
better to actually send me this but all
my goodness I am so thankful so this is
the benefit goop approved brow pencil
now this is amazing because you don't
know I've been using kind of like a brow
powder but the problem is it does get
kind of messy and also I have I always
have to like get a spoolie and brush my
brows into place but the great thing
about this is is two-in-one I only have
to look after one thing pretty much so I
don't tend to lose my spoolie which is
amazing so I put these Fuli this size to
basically brush my brows into place
which is pretty much what I'm doing
right now
and then once I bought the shape I can
basically just go in with the brow and
then on this side is the pencil which is
great because it just twists off you
don't have to have like you don't have
to go out and panic click or you don't
have a sharpener and your pencils broken
so it's really easy and as it's like
all-in-one I guess like two and one it's
really good for like an essential again
suppose you can just like take out your
makeup bag and it's so easy so I've been
loving it I'm going to use this petite
filling my brows right now now how I do
my brows is I basically a draw is pretty
simple I draw these shape of the brows
that I want to be so I kind of like
outline or the major parts of my brow to
get that particular shape so as you can
see out on the edge then I'm also going
to outline the front as well just so I
could basically fill it in inside
so as you can see this is literally so
so easy and then once I fill it in in
the front I go back to my spoolie which
I would do once I've got the shape that
I want and pretty much just fade out the
front like so
and in my browser done they were done
and quicker than ever and there was so
easy to do literally I hunger me using
that stuff a lot now I thought I said oh
you know what I'm actually going to go
in with the hoola bronzer just look of
it many won't do much the eye and it's
just a really really nice like warm
toned bronze so I just thought if I just
put this over the base of my eye it
would just be so easy and will create a
really nice look I have actually done
this before and it worked really nicely
so lips here I've just got like a bigger
kind of like outer lip brush and I'm
just buffing this over my eyelid as you
can see it's quite subtle but it's
definitely made a huge difference and
look so lovely you like when you compare
both my eyes right now this one looks
amazing
so I'm going to do the same and just
apply the bronzer on this side as well
and again just buffing it out over my
eyelid so pretty much I've got a two and
one here guys
so I've now grabbed a little brush and
again I'm just using the hoola bronzer
and I'm putting it under my eye is again
is so easy I'm just applying little
strokes try and also broke my eye out
and just making sure it looks filiz
ended with the same and kind of like
small brush I'm just applying it the
highlight in the inner of my eye oh my
goodness I've actually using no
eyeshadow products for this and it looks
pretty good and it's pretty damn easy
so mascara another great one I have the
benefit they're real mascara this is
such a good mascara and I'm going to be
applying this on my top and bottom
lashes I really love this mascara
because it's really great at spreading
out every single lash like I never knew
I had this many lashes honestly
mascara is dumb so if you find all a
thing if I makeup look is for the lips
I'm going to be applying at this the
lost by the Kylie collection this is in
the shade naughty so I'm just going to
put this all over my lips for the
finishing touch
so everyone here it is most finished
makeup look I still gonna get to stick
on my jeans and my great self I'm going
to do that once I've done my hair and
then after that I'm going to show you
the finished look so let's get on to do
my hair so remain on it to hair now I'm
going to take my hair down and today I'm
going to kind of go for like quite big
hair now I'm hoping I don't have any
hair hair but Walmart so I have my hair
up normally if I wanted to be as curly
and as big as I am making it today
normally I would straighten my hair fast
because the knots out but I actually
wash my hair this morning so to be
honest it's pretty straight for me
anyway so this is going to do I have
really a long hair so he does take me
what I mean it isn't any backlog but we
did about 15 minutes
considering my length of hair that was
not very long at all so what I normally
do is I put my hair in it to the part
and I want it to be which is usually a
middle part in so I'm just going to
split off the side and then I probable
and this is kind of stupid and just cut
half of it up it needs like a high pony
or a high bond basically just something
out of the way so I can start off with
my first side of hair so I've got my
hair I actually use a want as I think
there's so much quicker and easier it's
so simple easy to do so I'm going to
show you how I do that
now a full colors of these are ghd's I
don't know exactly what ones they are
I'd see that these platinum ones but
I'll linked up below whatever they are
because on INSEAD completely forgot the
name by by grabbing a piece of hair
towards the back and then I work towards
the front again I'm going to split this
in half so I kind of face my hehd down
because then the cold kind of drop a lot
better when you let go I basically just
color pretty much yet
and there you go oh good you've got
steaming hot right now so I'm going to
turn these off this is my hair color as
you can see it is super super super
super super curly right now now as you
can see that was so easy only took me
about 15 minutes in total what I'm going
to do after I've caught my hair is
because it's so curly and I wait Circle
it with bigger and fuller I tend to just
kind of just brush my fingers through
the curls because what this makes it
look like is a bit more full and also it
looks a little bit fluffier and thicker
it also just kind of you know run up my
fingers kind of like through my hair and
then once I've done that I pretty much
just leave it as we said that wasn't
really anything special because that's
how I wear my hair majority of the time
when I'm going out when I'm going to a
festival now it's time to add the jewels
and stuff and the accessories and let's
go
I can pay pound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
