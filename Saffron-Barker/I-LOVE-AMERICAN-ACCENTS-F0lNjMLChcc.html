Richey and this is where my Nana and
granddad semi live they live half a year
here half a year in England but we're
staying here the week cuz they're not
here at the moment
it's going to be different because
obviously in Orlando there's loads of
parks and things to do weather here it's
more just like malls and it's more like
beaches and stuff so so yeah it could be
more of a chilled week but the weather
is so much nicer here it's 5 p.m. right
now and the way that is so nice so to me
I'm already buffering it but yeah it's
just gonna be a chilled we're going to
go say hello to our neighbors in a bit
that we haven't seen for absolutely
years and then we're going to do some
food shopping as we're all starving and
there's no food in the house and I date
tonight it's going to be an early night
because we're all an athlete as well so
yeah in the car and we've been on the
way to the beach Alan - how long has it
took us to get this far about an hour to
get to the beach and we've just got here
