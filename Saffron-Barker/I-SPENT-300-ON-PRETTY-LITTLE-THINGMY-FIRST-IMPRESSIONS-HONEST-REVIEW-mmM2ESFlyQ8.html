a thirty thousand times not literally
hello everybody welcome back to my
channel
no I feel like I'm a little bit of a
mess today only because I feel like I
phone this intro a thousand times I'm
probably going to take off my glass here
because nightly can you guys see the
reflection but they are so so so dirty I
am the worst I just can't seem to clean
my glasses I don't know what it is
anyways let's actually just get into
this video so basically I feel like a
trend that a lot of you guys have been
loving is when people have been trying
out different clothing stores and you
will know like their different opinions
and stuff and the clothing so that I
love so much
it's called pretty little thing I
haven't actually ordered too much stuff
on the website though so I feel like
this is gonna be a perfect video for me
to do because I just wanted to make a
massive order and this video is
basically an excuse to do so so I bought
so much from pretty little tin like I
mean I have like massive massive massive
bags full so I'm so excited I know
obviously a lot of people have been
doing this like I know I understand a
pretty little thing video so that kind
of also made me just like want to make
my massive order so yes I have spent
only a little bit too much money
but if you like is okay because it makes
my heart so happy so we're just going to
get past how much I actually spend I
hope you guys do enjoy it smash a big
thumbs up if you guys do and subscribe
down below if you guys haven't already
and without further ado let's get into
the video look the first thing is this
blue denim skirt now I flippin love the
color I actually think it's like the
most perfect blue so pretty little thing
at the moment I can't remember what the
range is called but they're doing like a
big summer holiday range where it
includes like a lot of pastel colors
which is really really great because in
the UK a lot of clothing companies
aren't doing and like summer clothes yet
because obviously it's so miserable all
the time this is the skirt I think it's
so nice the color and of its so much
this is what it looks like from the back
or was this quite sure but it is a mini
skirt and I would definitely
I'm gonna give it a big thumbs up I do
just want to clarify I went a little bit
overboard with their mini scars but
their colors were just like on the point
I was like yes to the yes
so just pre-warning okay I did get
another miniskirt I am loving the
stripes on the side
I feel like stripes are really really
really in this year so I thought they
were really cute with the red Federline
of this is the second Scott I love it so
much
I think this stripe off the side is so
nice again this is what it looks like on
the back and this was actually a little
bit longer so if you're feeling that
then you know and so yeah I would give
this a big thumbs up because they're
100% white again
so with the right mini skirt the model
was wearing like a completely red outfit
honestly I just sat there and I was like
okay this is gold and it was like shot
the style so the jumper was also from
the site that she was wearing so I
thought I would purchase it as well I
should do can't really say much about it
it's just a bread plane cropped jumper
but it's really nice like I can fear or
what the fabric is really really really
lovely
it is quite cropped I've got the size
medium and I feel like it is still
really sure but I am gonna roll up the
sleeves like this because the arms are
really not on but I'm hoping this does
look really cute together just feel like
pretty little thing I'm so good at the
moment it's work because I feel like
their clothing is really great for all
shapes and sizes so this is the crop
jumper I think it's so nice that the
material feels really really really nice
and when I was it was so cheap as well
like I know it's only simple but I think
there's out that looks so cute together
and so many people asked me over on
Instagram because I did post a picture
wearing this outfit so yeah it's pretty
little thing so I'm going to kind of
look at things I haven't really seen
before so as I said I'm really fitting
the summer right past all rain
so oh this one on the set that I got
okay this is definitely a hit or a
Mexico my mom I thought this is gonna be
so full of it I was like I can just go
together so this looks amazing on the
word roll I'm not a monster howitzer it
isn't gonna be really super flattering
or really not because it has like an
elasticated waist so I feel like this
could be really flattering and I just
find this different this definitely
isn't the most comfortable outfit that
I'm ever on it the leg I've got a paper
bag on it it was a good song like yeah
this guy's just not very flattering
because it kind of like pop this out and
so part of the knee I don't know where
this however I do that the top is okay
look I do that the top could look really
cool but I definitely will work together
in fact I do not want to keep the skirt
this is looks so cool in the model but
somehow I'm sorry rocking it so much I
also feel like I'm part of orange is the
new black like you know so this is kind
of like a semi semi maybe I'll keep the
top it definitely wasn't keep the bottom
okay this is another hit or miss I
really don't know what this is gonna be
like so I bought this for the photo
shoot that I was doing so I thought it
could look really cool I thought like as
a shift dress
it was quite short like you could rock
it out with Converse or you could even
wear like the chunky heels I think it'll
look really cool
absolutely and love this the only
problem is this dress is already love me
is absolutely huge and it's so annoying
because it only comes in one size I
don't know why but when you're short
like I am and it's not gonna fit you
so unless you're about six but I don't
think there's any way you're going to
get into this I'm not actually sure this
is I think it's a place it is that Oh
some it's a midi dress okay let's give
this one a guy oh this is so cute I love
this oh I'm really excited this is
actually so pretty and the material and
stuff is really nice however when I
haven't got this on I don't see like
it's a bit too low card like it's not
read for me and I'm pretty no man to
want to wear a band dude I don't know I
just I feel like it's okay but honestly
like you
the bad new on honestly my boobs are
just everywhere that it would just
popping out or full display you won't
want to see it it's not a pretty sight
I'm just about to go to the band ooh and
how am i blinking is really pretty but I
just don't think that personally I would
worry so I'm gonna give this a Miss so
the next thing I got was this really
cute Rolla now I haven't actually ever
seen a denim bra that before so I
thought this is really different again I
put over super summery I think it's me
so nice on holiday and I actually
thought would be so nice I'm with this
like right denim skirt like I think it
looks so cute together because I know a
lot of people hate denim on denim but I
flippin love it
so this broiler I actually love it so
much Oh see it's just really simple
really plain I think it'll be really
nice like underneath things as well it's
like just on its own oh okay so be
prepared for a story time now so as I
said I have seen some of the stuff and I
bought I think I don't know if I've ever
order to choose from
pretty little thing or not but I
definitely haven't ordered a lot anyways
so this was kind of like my first
impressions of ordering shoes from
pretty little thing and I think their
quality of clothing is so so so good so
I ordered these hills I thought were
really lovely though quite basic and I
wore them out last night and I thought
yes to the yes but they are so cute like
I love them I think they're gonna be so
nice a black skinny jeans so I wore them
out I think I was wearing them for maybe
5 minute max like I'm not kidding I went
to the translation with my flats on and
when everywhere my flats on and then
just before I was going to a premiere
and put on these hills and I'm not even
kidding
2 minutes after it breaks like I'm not
kidding
look at the clip what's happening
she just broken my hair all the way to
the brim yeah and I'm not going like
there it doesn't thing that could
possibly ever that's how it should be
yeah
and make sure we don't have lot
obviously we will have to get the six
drops they can do it in time I don't
believe this the worse than that could
ever happen I we're gonna hope yes we
are gonna think about we just stay put
them in thank you
they might just do for the 1964 hour why
it's fine okay so basically oh my god
has happened to I just been really
unlucky like all their clothing that
I've tried before is such good quality I
was absolutely gutted because I was
going to a really important premiere
with shoes stay pulled together okay I
thought I'm going to be getting on
everybody's nerves now just keep
whipping out me sir the mono was wearing
this whole outfit again I'm just sure it
together yeah I think she did pick up
another miniskirt this is like a peach
color again I thought it was such a
lovely color and it's a little bit
different to the other miniskirts
because I've got got an itch my nose
because it's distressed on the front and
it has like a zipper going down the back
to go with it I've got this denim jacket
that's also key I'd feel like pretty
little thing you're just sorting out my
whole wardrobe they've given me like the
whole outfit so this car would I love so
much I think the car is so it's so so
pretty and I 100 percent wearing this on
holiday I just love here unlock the
denim on denim this will lift up on the
back and then yeah and the front are you
gonna give it
next thing I got was this shirt here I
kind of love this style like I think
it's so nice it kind of reminds me about
this arch in a way like I just think
it's really quietly and really lovely
this is really cool I'm not too sure how
you wear it though because I'm pretty
sure the model didn't have it on like
this but you can kind of like rock that
any way that you want so I kind of
wrapped it around the front and then
tied it like on the side but I do think
is actually really cute and I would wear
again I love this like little neck bit
here and I would definitely wear it
somewhere like holiday again so I didn't
just get everything for the summer I did
also get a jumper its nature this
quietly just says darling in a light
pink I just listened so nice and even
did things like if you do want to crop
this I do also think it would be really
really really nice I love this it's so
cookie inside I love it this is a
hundred percent ten out of ten
absolutely final thing that I did get
this softly see Quinn played soup so
this literally looked amazing oh my
goodness I want to wear this like a
party of somewhere it does look like it
hangs quite no though this is so so so
nice I just love black so with sigit
spattering - so kind of has like a
batwing arm like it's really really
really lovely how it's like mesh as well
I actually think this is so pretty
I love this so so so so much hello this
isn't my sides I'm going to actually
know how I got in it because I'm not a
size 4 and but it's so pretty and I do
actually want to like reorder this in my
size I do love it what are those over on
the back it has a bat wings arms as well
which is so pretty yeah I think I might
order this back in my size then I 100%
love there so it there is the
of the video I really hope you guys did
enjoy it hello so I'm gonna be leaving
