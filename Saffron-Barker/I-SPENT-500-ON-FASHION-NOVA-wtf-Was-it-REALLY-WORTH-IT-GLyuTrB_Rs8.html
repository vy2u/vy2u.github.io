looking forward to this one because I've
got a lot of spending on the website
called fashion Nova so I spent nearly
$500 don't ask me how everything was so
nice on the side this was how much I
ordered it's like a really big books but
you know but I think it's an American
site it was of nearly five hundred
dollars I spent so I'm assuming so
everything on the site was so nice
however the one thing I would say is it
made me feel insecure even just looking
at the site at like there was one person
who brought him to everything and
basically it was the most tiniest ways
and a really big bum which she honestly
she looked amazing not everyday people
kind of have that figure I definitely
don't have that figure I'm not my size
zero so I thought I would buy these
clothes to test them out to see what
they would look like on a room size body
and so yeah it's very exciting some of
the folks actually so nice so I can't
wait to actually see and the one thing I
wore says well is actually came quite
fast I can't remember exactly how long
ago I ordered them it might have been
around like a week ago maybe just over a
week but this earring that was coming
from another country that's actually
quite fast and I didn't pay any extra
for shipping either
let's get in to the big box of clothes I
hope you guys enjoy this video a big
thumbs up you guys do and subscribe down
below and also obviously don't forget to
go and kick that Bell button on the
screen right now so you get notified
every single time I upload in video but
yeah I hope you guys enjoy and let's get
into it absolutely love this okay
it's so cute however I do kind of like a
more my dressing gown but the color is
so nice I'm gonna show you full length
well this looks like I'm exaggerating a
little bit but it does kind of work and
wear my dressing gown it is pretty big
now I'm going back
a little bit on when I said it one plug
fits all because this is on your side a
and normally I fit into a size si this
is actually really really really big for
me however I did actually try and get
close that would actually set all wood
shapes rather than just one size I do
like though I love the arm but the
sledge arms are so pretty I like the
material it's good material I really
want a size down and see what this would
actually look like on because I
genuinely think if it was smaller and it
fit to the moon I would actually wear
this out so yeah I mean I do like it
it's really good quality right tip but
it's far too thick but first time ever I
might just have to buy aside their own
address oh my goodness this is gonna
take forever to put on I have to get
these just because now the weirdest
things I've ever seen in my whole life
so I just had to see what it was gonna
be like in my life and that then just
wait so this is what it is all the jump
ropes you can actually see they're like
high-waisted and these are the trousers
as you can see what to think
love that matching mix on which you can
see on the side I really want to get
your opinions on these because they're
kind of a bit out there a bit weird do
you like them do you know if I'll leave
a pole up here because I'm actually
intrigued I mean they don't complete a
quite stretchy you know there's you bend
your leg you need those through nyaka
that's really comfy I absolutely loved
this online this was everything to me
like it was straight in the basket
however when I've seen it in real life
the material was really cheap it feels
very thin it's kind of got that
elasticated feeling I'm gonna show you
forward a little side so this is what it
is like on you guys are probably wear
this like really keen top like I've got
on now I came out to this life around
the pole I think
amazing in photos and stuff but now it
looks like on the camera right now but I
can imagine it doesn't set up on the
camera than it does in real life because
it is like really really really thin in
real life but I love the design very
tropical it gives me a good hard in
bills
there's my view it's a fear help I'm not
sure if I wear about maybe the kind of
love in it but yeah I'm fashioned over
are killing it when it comes to the tops
I love this - some people might just set
up a basic fast and obviously it's got
the American flag on it but I think it's
a little bit cooler because it's almost
like a washed out people that follow me
a lot I know me quite well we know how
obsessed I am with America so why not
weather five on me I love it Kasim us
awareness 100% there's the top I
absolutely love it so much it's like
dripping paint it's so cool the gold is
always a 3d it's so nice I've just never
really seen a top like this and a store
before I thought it was like a little
bit cooler I don't know I just haven't
seen anything like it and I love a
business like you know I love a special
color on my t-shirt it's almost like
stretchy like it feels elastic a ship
but it does actually feel really
expensive and look up close like what
this looks like
please excuse because clearly I've got
my bikini top Wallander which actually
goes to show you how see through this
top is no I actually really like it's me
it's actually quite a shame and it's so
see-through I feel like I still would
wear it though I just have to work with
the wiper and I guess you would see the
bra it says a crybaby on it and I just I
don't know why I just kind of thought it
was quite cold just like a basic average
tea again the quality's good I really
like the fact that it's right here and
right here as well just because me and
white t-shirts don't do very well
because like I get makeup on every white
t-shirt that I own within seconds so
it's actually quite nice that it has the
red here so I won't get makeup on it so
yeah again I think I actually would wear
this I do really like it so even though
I see through it I'm still going to give
it a big thumbs up again another top
that I absolutely like in love with I
will
a hundred percent keep this wall I am
keeping this it's so cool yes in the
middle I don't know why I just love the
picture and it is so cool it has at
least I want to use you don't ask that
little action feel to it and then this
leaves and never actually seen sleeves
like this but it's like pots I don't
really know what the white is but
they're like all puffy I'm really cool
and it's a crop top and basically it
just gives me the feels like I can see
myself wearing this on holiday in fact I
hope I would wear anywhere but this
gives me the holiday vibes
I love the sunglasses as well it looks
really cool and so this is what it looks
like
April I have to you love these shorts
and again I would wear them they're like
a washed out grey just dead and
Herreshoff somewhere but they have these
like really really really big stuff on
them which i think makes it so cool and
obviously they have all the rips here as
well which is really nice and then this
is the back of the short throws a bit
longer it's still quite short
yeah overall I would again I would buy
these and they're really good material
as well so yeah I actually got a couple
of these just because I knew that I
really liked it I really like material
and this is like super super super
stretchy this is great for honestly like
anybody type I feel like anybody can get
into this which is really great I love
the tiger as well so what in this cup is
really cute they're also got it in a
yellow hey and this is the other one I
love this color it's so cute yay another
top I actually really like and again I
would wear obviously this is just a
really basic tee with lots of rips in it
and I just put up over this yellow clay
suit just because why not
basically but yeah yeah this is actually
really nice that it's thin I thought
people might find this table is like
quite thin and say it's cheaper whether
I actually really like but that it's
thinks I feel like it would fit my zone
it would hang myself
especially when it's tucked into items
of clothing so I actually really like
cuff dinners top is as well okay yeah
well I mean it's not much you can say
about it really kind of it's a ripped
t-shirt but yeah I like it over this
reminds me of a ripoff version of the
Saatchi
however I kind of love it in fact I
really love it
I mean it's it's really cheap material I
realized I thought this is one thing
that definitely does a better online
again is one of those I think will look
so good in a photo like I do think it
kind of that's caught I think it's like
jackets like this so I know I'm right
I'm not sure if I would wear it I think
it depends on the outfit I put with it I
feel like this could be really cool but
then it could also know quite cheap
because of the style of it because
obviously it's sort of like gold wood
but it's not like really good quality so
if you don't have any hand stitching
it's 90 the material of the jacket at 50
it's just more so the prints so keep an
eye on the graph to see if I wear this
again actually a father this doesn't
really cool I love this place soon it's
really nice it's like a stick it almost
hurts damn it's ugly Shawn gray because
it's so thin so it really really really
can't see this elastication around the
waist which is great and you know what's
really great about it as well is but but
it has sleeves like three kind of
quarter length sleeves is really nice
because when you go around holiday a lot
the time they have aircon on like when
you go into restaurants and stuff and
you're always freezing
Wow anyways so it's perfect for me it
also has pockets in the back somewhere
yeah which is really cool as well yeah a
little extra detail on touch and then
these shoes are also from fashion over
and I have never loved a pair of shoes
so much in my entire life
these have many written all over them
they actually if you can see up close I
don't know if you can they're almost
like snake print which is really really
really nice again I mean obviously I
would wear these they are me in a shoe
if I could design a shoe it would look
like this and inform Instagram again you
would have liked to see me wear these
recently because I just can't resist
this place it again I actually like it
obviously hello everything in this hole
which is great so I mean he's seen a
little bit weird on me just because I
haven't like a bra
any joke one again that'll be why but I
actually really like obviously needs to
be able to ollie and I'll show you the
back it's really nice if you have like
across from the back and these greatest
moments and when it's out of you both of
our probably wearing it to drop I would
wear a band do because I don't like it
that's revealing but if you into that
then obviously you just wear it like
this oh yeah I mean I actually quite
like this it's my favorite thing in the
entire world is quite basic but you can
get this from a lot of other sites but I
think it's really important again it so
that weekend of the video and I really
hope you guys it did enjoy it I did like
the big sidewalk only thing I was a tiny
bit disappointed in was some of the
fabrics because some of it was like I
don't know it's just a fabric I
personally would have wear as a bit
stretchy it has spandex in the fabric
and which basically means it's like a
bit stretchier and thinner and whatever
that's not really a bad thing but it's
just not what I like used to wearing but
I have to give like some of the pieces
some of them were really really really
nice so yeah I hope you guys did enjoy
let me know down in the comments if
you've ever shopped at fashion over
before and your experience because I'm
intrigued but yeah that's it for this
video
I would also have a blogging channel you
should definitely go and subscribe to
that I'll also leave that down below and
yeah hope I get to see you guys very
very soon
