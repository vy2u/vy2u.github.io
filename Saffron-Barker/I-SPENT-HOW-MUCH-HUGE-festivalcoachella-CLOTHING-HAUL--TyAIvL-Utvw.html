welcome back to my channel and now for
today's video I am like so excited
because I'm actually doing a coach had a
whole like I never in a million years
thought this was gonna happen like I
never thought I'll be sitting here
saying I'm doing Coachella Hall cuz I'm
going to Coachella like next week and
I'm very unprepared like if you follow
my blogs if you full of my life you will
know that it's just part of my
personality I'm so unprepared for
everything and I have left this very
last minute so I'm leaving to go to
Coachella on Wednesday by the time
you're watching this is three days away
so I had a little bit panic and I
ordered quite a bit now I don't think
anything goes together yet but I ordered
some pretty cool pieces and I'm very
excited and they've been what extra you
know rather than your typical everyday
to day clothes obviously it's not all
just for Coachella because you know how
to throw some other bits here and there
because when you're browsing you just do
and so some of this stuff like I will
wear what I thought all about I am going
or just like Coachella but it's just you
know here are some bits I thought would
be cool at Coachella I don't know if you
guys are going or if you go to any
festivals but I thought this haul may
just help you out a little bit if you're
going to parties or whatever so I'm here
and whether or not it's sunny where you
guys are I don't know but I am bringing
you I'm giving you the summer vibe so I
hope it makes you happy now for today's
video it's actually sponsored by an app
code 21 buttons which I'm so grateful
for because if you guys do follow my
blogging channel you will know that I
love 21 patterns if you haven't heard we
talked about it in my vlogs and you
would know that I'm quite forget forward
on Instagram I know you can like tag
items of clothing and you can actually
get like a direct link to where and I
know a lot of you struggle to find when
my clothes are from and I know how
annoying it is that noise what is that
noise it's coming from somewhere over
there
I know how annoying it is as well when
you're trying to find something and even
though you found the shop you haven't
actually got the direct link to find it
so basically 21 buttons does exactly
that so this is my profile that you guys
can see right now now these are just
photos that I've been uploading
on all of my social medias but obviously
on this side I'm giving you guys the
direct link basically as an example this
photo here if you wanted to find out why
my top was from you just click on the
button and it says the shop but then
also you can click on visit website and
it would give you a direct link to go
and buy the top or you know have a look
at the top it makes it really really
quick and easy obviously not only that
you guys can have your own profile and
you can upload photos it's really fun to
get like style inspiration I use it a
lot for that I follow I only follow 20
people but I love all of their
counselors like I'm always stalking and
like looking like inspiration and in
fact I've been doing that by coach other
outfits as well be sure to follow me on
it if you guys don't have the app I will
leave their link down below for you guys
to go and download it but yeah without
further ado I hope you guys enjoy it
obviously all of my clothes so I'm going
to be showing here I'll put the direct
links over on my 21 buttons and as I'm
at Coachella obviously I'm going to be
vlogging but you can also see my entire
outfits like when I'm actually there
over on my way to a buttons account as
well because as I said haven't actually
got all outfits yet I've just got random
bits and bobs anyways I hope you guys do
enjoy the video
smash your big thumbs up and subscribe
down below and let's get into the video
oh and just to let you guys know as you
know that I like to be real with you I
do actually earn commission from the
button links but you guys can do the
same as well if he doesn't just have to
be influences like with your account if
somebody buys anything from your button
you can own commission from that as well
even though I said I got a fair bit I
only actually shopped at two different
shops the birds won't be misguided so
let's go through
but first okay there's a lot hi guys if
my first item doesn't shout Coachella I
seriously don't know what does so the
first thing is these are black denim
rainbow sequin shorts they are so so so
cool
they're quite in your face but I feel
like that's what Coach Taylor is you
know and also I've tried them on they're
really really really fat ring as well I
remember like I pulled the mother bag
and I was like okay like I'm totally in
love with these but then I was like oh I
want to get too excited in case they
don't like fit me well fit my body but
they are actually so so so flattering
and fit me really really really nicely
and also I'm really glad that it's not
got rainbow sequins on the back cuz as
much as I loved it I thought that maybe
would be a little bit I don't know for
me personally I like that it's like like
wow in the front and a little bit more
subtle in the back so this was the first
thing that I got and I loved and then
the model did actually have this jacket
on with the shorts I'm going to show you
and I kind of intimating it like I don't
know if I would wear it together or not
but honestly this is my favorite thing
in the entire whole the next stop again
definitely screams Coachella is this
sequin jacket and it has this tiger on
the back it kind of reminds me of like
wannabe Gucci but yet again it's still
like so so so cool and on this looks so
good from the back I feel like it does
hang a little bit weirdly here and the
who cares but that looks so cool that
I'm like so over and these colors kind
of remind me a bit like of a mermaid the
short have a little bit of this color or
anything but these are like my favorite
color sequins so I think it's really
really really pretty and it's really
flippin cool so again look out on my 21
buttons and obviously all my other
social media I'm gonna be vlogging next
up what should go for next okay this is
a little bit more laid-back and wasn't
too sure about this but after I tried it
on I actually really really really like
this it's kind of like similar to what
I'm wearing right now and I don't know
if this is basketball baseball I was
trying to wire this up the other day boy
is this I think it's baseball you know
it kind of looked my basketball but I
don't think you can get basketball
shirts with like
longer sleeves I don't know but it's
kind of at the same look as what I'm
wearing right now and I love these
oversized t-shirts with long knee-high
socks I think they were so so so cool
and like boots and so I'm kind of
planning on maybe wearing that with this
and the thing that I liked about this is
obviously it has the tassel so it kind
of screamed more festival then more like
an everyday basketball baseball shirt as
I'm wearing right now so yeah I really
really really liked it again it's from
excited this is actually an outfit that
the board was wearing together again so
I love when a model has like such a good
Alpha on and you're like yes I love all
of that I'm gonna buy it off that's
basically why this this is a red leather
jacket with like stars all over it and I
just love stars in general and I think
they look really really really corn this
jacket this is kind of more my like edgy
look I don't know when I would wear this
but I would probably wear this like with
a big black hat I may be somewhat cowboy
boots like I don't know I want to have
like one day where I'm like very like
glam and sequin and glitter and then I
want to have another demo a bit more
like edgy and cool well I've got three
days so so yeah I really really really
do like this the only thing I would say
about this jacket is it feels kind of
plasticky because of it obviously it's
not real leather but even like fake
leather jackets I've had before they are
less plasticky than this it feels quite
cheap but I feel like it is gonna look
really really really good at photo so
that's all that counts and then I really
like the bow as well about school but
I'm getting it all twisted and to go
with that obviously I've said that I'm
gonna buy like a big black hat and I
want to buy some suits this again looks
quite cheap but in pictures I feel like
it's gonna look really good and it does
look better on than it does off
personally this is what it looks like
it's like I don't know it's different
eyeliner cuz it's different but again it
does feel quite cheap but it was like
pretty cheap and it does a really really
really cool and photos and then the fact
which is so pretty because it's backless
and like I love backless pieces because
I just think it's so pretty even though
I'm probably going to be wearing that
jacket with it but together
I'm telling you now it looks so good and
then I think this is the very last thing
that I got from misguided and if this is
actually stunning it is I mean this is
actually this was really expensive I
think this is part of their like I don't
know what the range was called but it
was like a very glamorous more expensive
range but it is amazing
so it's this sequin beaded kimono and
it's obviously very long and it's
amazing because I won't even your hands
in the air it's like you look like an
angel
so I was thinking again like if I was to
coach head it'd be really cool like my
hands in here that do have peace signs
and stuff like that so it's it's so so
so pretty this is like much as I can
show you it's like really really really
hard to show because it's so big it's
actually really heavy as well because
the secret and the beads
but yeah it's amazing the only thing is
like I don't want to get it dirty
because if I do I do not think you can
put this in the washing machine because
all the secrets are come off I've
actually noticed already that sequins
have come off but it's okay because
there's so many I really don't think
you're gonna notice at all yeah this is
absolutely gorgeous and I think me and
my mom are gonna share this just for
like ever and this is something I will
have for a very long time so I'm glad by
spend the money on this because I'll
wear this a lot like I'll even just wear
this in the UK I'll give this a sunny
day and we're going up somewhere fancy
or I don't know so exactly is that is
every home every one I ordered one other
thing I ordered another kimono I don't
actually like here I loved on the model
but I don't actually like her on me
personally I do think it's really pretty
but I don't know I just don't like it so
I'll show you guys anyways because it is
really cool but it's another kimono I
don't know I just expect to be sequence
to be a little bit smaller and more
lifelike I think that's why I like the
of the kimono because even though it's
like very in-your-face it's still very
subtle at the same time however this was
just a bit too in-your-face for me but
it really cooks it's like shearing it's
like seat room on the back and then all
of this
like sequins on both sides yeah it's
cool it's just I don't know I personally
did like on me I feel so lost and I got
that was now that was everything that I
did get for this time when this leather
bag is currently empty so let's move on
to the second shot things are we really
need to show you guys these I definitely
won't be able to wear them at Coachella
because I don't think thin little Hills
are very sensible appropriate but these
are so cute and again if you guys do
follow my vlogging channel then you
would have seen these because I did show
you guys them as soon as I bought them
Nicole I don't know if you guys know my
family but my brother's girlfriend
Nicole we was out shopping together and
she saw them Friday and she was like
these are you like these are you in a
shoe and I was like yes they are they're
so mean these are absolutely gorgeous
and I love them they're like cool
they're edgy red and pink is actually my
favorite like color combination I just
think it looks so good together yes I
bought these hills
they were $29.99 which I didn't actually
think was too bad however I've never why
don't you have had thin hills like this
I don't know how I'm gonna do on them
because they are like really really
really thin yeah that's kind of what and
then find that all of this was Coachella
some of this was a little bit off-topic
but it was cute so but anyways so I got
this jacket and I feel like it either
gonna love it or you gonna hate it this
is quite like simple but so you know
when people say neces more I feel like
this is this jacket it's like a
waterproof bomber basically because it's
quite short so this is it here and I
really really really like the yellow
drawstrings I think they're really cool
and obviously it has a hood and stuff
yeah there's pretty much no other way to
describe it rather than a waterproof
bomber but I thought this would be
really cool over a hundred percent ones
to Coachella like in the evenings
because the thing is like as much as
it's sunny in LA like it does actually
brain a fair bit when it's not like
actually the summer and also when it's
windy it's like it's with its
really cold I thought this jacket would
not only look really cute but it would
also be such a sensible choice to take
as well yeah I actually really like this
I don't know why it's kind of boring but
I just think you know less is more and
then I got this top again I don't know
if I will wear this to Coachella but
I'll definitely wear it at home or
whenever I are anyways so this is a
Flashdance top I don't know if you guys
ever seen the movie Flashdance but
that's what the top is and it's really
cool and then this finally I got two
last things I'm not going to wear these
together but I did love them both
and now this is a track suit but I won't
wear it together so I got these bottoms
these like smart joggers and you guys
know that I love smart chokers because I
wore jeans for so many years like I
never wore leggings I was never into
them and I just bought jeans and then I
all of a sudden I was like I'm so bored
of wearing jeans like I just feel like
even though I've done I wear the same
thing every day so I kind of really put
into smart your goods because they were
like cool and also really comfy so they
have like an elasticated waist and they
have the yellow or white stripe down the
side and yellow some of my favorite
colors and then also I really like this
the other bottom this is my favorite bit
like I love bottoms that have this
elasticated bit at the bottom as well
so I thought these were really really
really cool and then I saw the jacket
and I was like hang on and this could
look cool at Coachella but again like
obviously I'll wear this at home because
I don't actually have any like full
outfit yeah this is the jacket it
getting kind of reminds me of like a
bomber it's like really really cool
house like the it has it's obviously
like elastic up here and it's also like
elastic at the bottom
yes just like I said part that jacket
and it's cool and the yellow and white
stripes again I don't know everybody
wear this together I don't think I would
I probably wear this separately
sorry one and that's the end of this
whole now I did spend a lot of money I
know but I actually really really really
liked everything that I bought and I've
tried it all on and I feel like it looks
really good on so I'm very very
excited to post my outfit pics and I'm
at Coachella
so obviously guys if you can't follow my
21 buttons go follow it so you guys can
go and get the direct links to my outfit
and then also I'm gonna sing you guys a
chant we're not really a challenge but
if it really really really cool if
obviously I'm going to Coachella three
days after this video goes live but once
I posted the outfit pictures on my 21
buttons go and bow on which one you guys
think is my best look I'm intrigued and
also actually let me know down in the
comments what your favorite bits and
