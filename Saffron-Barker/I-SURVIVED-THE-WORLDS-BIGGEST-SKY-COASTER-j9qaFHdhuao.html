cheeky one and a lot of basil
so as a lot of you may know absolutely
love a part so right now about talking
on my face for our
embittered happy things
like
so right now I'm in heaven and I have
seen so many brushes that I want to buy
actually that one the yeah I've watched
so many and I'm so excited right now
all this brush that I'm just about to
buy it's like it's a contour parted like
fits the t-phone perfectly so it's so
nice so I'm definitely gained by this so
this is the most amazing rock track of
everything in my whole life
unfortunately I'm not buying it really
really what it is absolutely
but a service benefit with my core and
so nice
but as you know I've just come back from
shopping and I just shoved on my gym
wear as I'm now heading down to the gym
as we're going out to eat tonight so I
want to burn some calories as I have
been to the gym yet so oh my God look
there's a water there's a water fountain
on the lake and it's so Brickley this is
kind of on overhead covering it and it's
really nice there's a lizard everywhere
I walk yes so I'm heading down to the
gym now to burn some calories so let's
go hi guys so the last of my blog was
when I was at the gym last night but
then after the gym I felt really really
ill and I have done all day so we've
kind of just like children the pool
today and but now I'm about to go get my
nails done which I'm excited for because
I actually got I now missing and it
doesn't look great and then I'm probably
gonna go on the scariest ride of my life
which I'm actually really excited for
but I'm really dreading at the same time
it's a 500-foot like swing and then it's
like a catapult there's like two
different ones and they're both like 500
feet so it's gonna be really scary but I
am excited I'm not gonna lie I am
excited so yeah I'm going to show you
because I'm going to wear the GoPro and
I've lost my family I don't know where
they are and yeah I'm going to wear the
GoPro when I go on there so you're
probably gonna be like scream and I'm
probably like crying on it but yeah so
I'll make sure to film that yeah now
we're going to get on now some so it's
gonna be it's gonna be I don't know what
it's gonna be
Oh is he safe pumpkin sovereign if you
want to sit there for half an hour and
it's really boring but where the hell am
i oh there's my car so I just come up
your nails all right gentlemen have some
bread and I have reckoned it was I'm won
t not just a girl
yeah I got and umbrage of just sit in
the chair for about half an hour so I
didn't what color to get I finally got a
go simple
and are over
yeah but now I
I'd like to see Viper about Monroe on
technically the morning
one essential Hyneman
one of them just reassure people
the same
now all made in Old Town
how am I feeling I'm Tina
petrified so bad can't say why but soon
as I get one true it just specifies data
with Philippines
when you
what
from my record
okay so we
I know
to be the best thing I have ever been on
my whole life absolutely crazy
I'd say oversight of things from or
completely when I are and then the
second time we pay more then you get to
go even higher than you did the first
time so it was insane and mumble
but me my job when employees and
gentlemen also
oh my god it's amazing and I want to go
I wish we could go
Colorado we try to get the GoPro on but
they wouldn't let on start obviously
paying for the video
and so yeah I'm going to put that heart
which is probably better anyway but yeah
it's mad
so I'm gonna add my own my go and that's
what I'm not saying okay so it's
