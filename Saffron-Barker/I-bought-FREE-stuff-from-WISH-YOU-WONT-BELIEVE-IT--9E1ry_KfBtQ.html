welcome back to my channel now for
today's video I am so excited because
recently I've done quite a few videos
and ordering things from the store wish
now from which I didn't realize this
until the other day you can actually
order free things so I did exactly that
and I'm so excited because like where on
earth like whose Stowers free things
nobody just doesn't happen in the world
so I was like heck yes I'm gonna get
some free stuff so I'm pretty excited
I've got quite a few bits even though
not all of it is coming yet it took
around a month to arrive as well so is
this like free stuff actually worth the
effort I have no idea I really really
really hope so though and this is like
quite a new thing to me however when I
actually YouTubed it I said that a
couple of people have done this video
before so it might not be new to you
guys but it definitely is to me and I do
think this is so flippin called you
think that I technican bought stuff that
was free I have you guys do enjoy smosh
a big thumbs up and subscribe down below
if you guys haven't already and one last
thing before we do get into the video I
also have a daily vlogging channel that
you should also go and subscribe to I'll
also link you to health alone it's on
screen right now and see I thought I'd
check that out and I hope you guys enjoy
and let's get into the video so I've got
a like a random selection of bits and
bobs now weird maybe some of the stuff
isn't even free anymore so basically
right every hour of so that changes and
I'm not even kidding I've gone on the
site puts up in my basket and they're
like an hour later they were like change
the price so this might not be free now
but it definitely was free at the time
so I don't know how much the shipping
was for this I think it was maybe like 2
pounds so this very first thing you only
need to be really careful as well
because it's like clickbait you so
basically like you think something's
gonna be freaking added to your basket
basically that color isn't so there'd be
like one color and one size that's free
so I was like
gobsmacked when I saw that this is
breaks it's bright pink and I was like
yes so I think it was like a couple of
other colors maybe in like black and
white that was like two pounds of
something so again it's still affordable
but it's not gonna be free so this is
the very first thing so it's this off
the shoulder top it's very out there
it's very summery I actually really like
the color oh why
okay so it has this that like crosses
over and then it's like off-the-shoulder
I mean if I'm being completely honest
this the fabric is so so so cheap that
you can tell that it's free um I
wouldn't personally wear this but I
can't speak to sing because I've
actually tried it on but I wouldn't go
buy this in the shop because it's it's
obviously the cheapest like material
ever but then at the end of the day what
do you expect when it's free and it kind
of makes me think I wonder if the black
and white way is the same or it's
different material because it's not free
I don't know let's try this on here is
the top now if I'm being completely
honest I just don't like it like it's
just not my style
however if you do like the top then
obviously like it's great it's free like
it's just like a basic top is a little
bit uncomfortable like it's not as
elasticated as it looks
it keeps quite tight I think if you
maybe if you didn't have much like boob
then it would it'll be better to sit
nicer for me doesn't really sit well I
don't exactly have massive boobs yeah I
mean it's okay
it's definitely see-through like oh if I
was to wear this I would wear on holiday
or something some see you can see go
through to my shorts and if you like to
talk then it's great it's free but me
personally I just don't really like it
right what's happen s actually a
normative these are actually so cute I
love shorts like it's but I know that
Topshop and that style short like this
and that's so should I say something so
hopefully these are actually so cute no
they definitely aren't really really
really thin and if I'm comparing them to
my Topshop 15 pounds one they definitely
aren't quite same material but I feel
like these will probably still be like
quite cookie like I don't know if I wear
these I don't know might do really like
them like I actually really really
really like the style of them depending
on how thin it is maybe I would wear it
out maybe I wouldn't buy definitely wear
them indoors and I really do like the
elasticated voice and I feel like guys
I've got a whole outfit for free here
how amazing is that these look tiny
though I think they're gonna go right up
my bum and I can do
so all right yes the short please excuse
the camel toe but this is it really from
the back vehicle right it's just swim
run I'm not too sure
so here's the shot that's from the
basketball up they are I said up there
nobody nice from the back well I think
they look like cycling shorts in the
back but from the front there's just so
much camel toe going on these little
things here are called mock slipper
floor polishes okay all right this is
the weirdest thing I've ever eaten in my
entire life
and I don't think I would have ordered
it if it wasn't frayed but you know what
they're really really really soft and
these could what other things do
actually work I'm gonna give these to my
mom because she is going to love them
but she doesn't have to bend down her a
batch you can just swipe I don't really
know what the word is but these at you
so cute so I've got my skipper polishes
I've obviously got a whole outfit ready
for this got my pajama shot I saw with
big jump up but basically I'm not sure
to see how this works
but I feel like they're so comfy I have
a little bit the dance do you got out of
work work no I mean I can get fit into
this thing is they're really comfy but
how do I save my August joy just see if
I've picked any girl yeah I mean I don't
think it's obviously the best thing ever
but it is fun they're really hot I would
actually wear these like two beds quite
a cool jokey present isn't it for
someone yeah it likes your love cleaning
or something yes until you my father
said oh you know they used so the second
person now when I was doing this I
didn't like particularly choose
everything I wanted I just went onto the
categories I just tried to get the first
random free things I found oh my god
this is so cute look at the little
pom-pom so this is the little makeup bag
and it's like really small but this is
like such a cute little size
I love the eyelashes this reminds of my
Primark Grange if you guys have ever
shopped it considering this is free this
is so cute and I would actually use this
and I put my brushes in or maybe like my
go-to extensions that I did he did I put
too much makeup in more bad overall well
this is so nice
it also has that like waterproof for
lining inside and I just love the extra
detail that it has like it doesn't look
as cheap as it well it definitely
doesn't look free it doesn't look as
cheap as it was so like I would give
this a thumbs up and I 100% use it for I
think I remember what they say it's
going on what's this why I got a
long-lasting eyeliner in it I've got two
one I basically just got a free gift
with my free gift what the hell is this
I look like an Anderson right now or
this just is like so dope Glenn that
looks really wrong but and we don't want
to use this as a hood dryer you could
use their slicer fancy dress costume
just get some ears and you're sorted you
can go as an elephant so I think you
pulled the string am I doing this right
hang on so basically what you do you
should pull the strings bit too big for
me and then you put your hair dryer in
it oh my goodness I can't even look at
myself
put the hair dryer in it and then
basically it keeps all the heat in your
hair and it's right your hair if this
works why hasn't this been a thing
already I think it's a work but my mom
thinks it well right so basically my
header is actually fit on the end of
this and I can't run into it so I'm just
gonna try and just like press it on and
just see well I can't imagine this is
gonna work for less give it a go okay
that is the coolest thing ever I did not
expect that to happen
oh my goodness I am telling you right
now that that's my time oh I did yeah
guys white people for that at you so I
think this might actually work
I feel like genuinely like I would give
this a thumbs up I need to try this
properly but this is the this is the
best thing ever stop wait what is this
this is like the shorts it I okay sit
I love this color so nice I just love
like this kind of like tops and shorts
but that's so cute
this it free top is like a little and
violet little crop top and I have to
think it's so so so cute it's like a
halter neck it's actually so so so nice
again obviously it's gonna be like quite
a cheap material when it's quite thin
but I again it's free like you just
can't complain and I feel like this is
actually gonna look so cute I love this
it's not really much else to say about
it to be honest but I think the comments
really pretty really cute again this was
the only color that was free but I won't
you really really really happy with the
color I actually really really really
like this top a lot more than I was
expecting to the quality is actually
really good like I use fighting it to be
quite see-through and just quite thin
but I wouldn't be any different if I
bought it from any high street store I
would go out and buy this I love the
color it's a great fit so you will see
me wearing this so it's a big thumbs up
search so oh my god this is so cute
isn't it's better to have the straps and
stuff I would buy not that I don't know
if it's gonna fit me sits on one size
this size of the slice smaller that's
the only size that was free and not
entirely sure it's gonna fit my boobs
but let's just hope it is quite stretchy
so maybe just maybe but it is really
really cute and this is the lip lines of
like a pair of denim shorts or even on
its own to be completely up what's out
or even underneath things it would be
really really really nice pop it sign
with nothing else oh my god little cutie
some time guys I love this top I mean
we're working the bra underneath there
but how cute is this Odyssey I would go
on by this I can't believe this is free
and I could have expected this video to
be a bit on the left side but you know
what I feel like I've been quite
positive and everything's turned out
pretty decent like I've got my watch so
everyone Illumina will you think overall
I think is it was like 50/50 like I mean
it's just really good at this stuff was
free I'm so there were some other bits
I'm still missing as well I mean
obviously to take quite a long time but
considering it didn't exactly what is
this free I think yeah I think I've
wronged it you can't really go wrong and
I feel like that's what happens if you
order three things from work so
basically to sum it up you can get
obviously some free stuff from which
that's actually like okay however you
are technically paying for it because
obviously you're having to pay for the
shipping so if you're willing to wait
like six maybe like a month to six weeks
for your things to come and just
basically look at it and just think
would I pay two pounds for this because
that's how much you're technically
paying for your free item then great but
for me personally I don't know if I'd
actually buy this stuff but knowing that
it's cost me like twenty four pounds I I
would have probably rather said the
twenty four pounds but I did think it
was really interesting and it's not like
the stuff is really bad you can't expect
it to be like this amazing quality stuff
because it was super affordable or free
whatever you want to call that but yeah
I hope you guys did enjoy the videos
anyway and if such a big thumbs up
