channel now for today's video are you
guys requested it we are doing a Primark
clothing video which excites me so much
and honestly what helps so perfectly
because obviously as I said you guys
asked for this video and I haven't
shopped in Primark for clothes for the
longest time so this was basically a
great excuse for me to go shopping
I bought a week's worth of clothes so
it's 7 full outfits for either just
under 200 pounds or like just around 200
pounds which to be honest I think is
actually amazing considering you've got
like seven different outfits so
hopefully this video does help you guys
out if you're shopping on a budget some
of the times are thinking nice but I'm
not too sure where they're gonna like on
so obviously I'm gonna try everything on
for you let you know exactly how much
everything was my Primark store is quite
hard to shop in space again from
Brighton and the Brighton store I mean
it's big but it's nowhere near as big as
the other prymaat stores I've been in
especially the ones in London and it's
quite messy as well so it's quite hard
to find things so it did take a while to
find outfits but in the end we've got
there a simple outfits I do like them
they definitely wear the best I could
get and I'm really really really hoping
they do look good on so obviously I
didn't pry my stores you can get
different clothes because all of them so
different stuff but some of the same
stuff too so anyways I really hope this
video it does help you guys out if
you're shopping on a budget or if you're
thinking of going to Primark or you need
an outfit for something or even if you
just enjoy watching these videos I
really hope you guys do enjoy smash a
big thumbs up if you guys do and
subscribe down below and finally before
we get into the video I have a vlog
channel that you guys subscribe to
without further ado let's get into the
video
it's that my cute day outfit it's like
very spring-like I really like it it was
very affordable
these shoes are like Chanel Jeeps and I
love them so much they were only six
pounds guys I flippin love them I would
wear them with like pretty much anything
that you guys know how much I love
sliders anyway so I really
really really like these shoes the shoes
were six pounds the top was five pounds
and this was 12 pounds you know it's
really great material I mean it's not
the most bath drinks it's really like
thick but it's really comfy and yeah the
material is really good so overall I
really in like this outfit and it was 23
pounds this is my like a beach outfit I
love it so much obviously you can bathe
in the daytime Weaver at nighttime it's
just a bikini top that I found but I
think it's so pretty
and then I've just got some like
embroidered shorts that are so nice I
love the pom-poms my shoes I love so
much they are they kind of remind me of
like Valentino and Sandra dupes they're
so pretty but obviously way more
expensive and then the promo version the
kimono was six pounds the top was 10
pounds the shorts were 8 pounds and the
shoes there were six pounds no one would
expect to pay less for a bikini top on a
pair of shorts because in terms of their
18 pounds like for Primark but if you
actually look at the detailing on this
like it's so pretty
obviously it's all embroidered I would
expect to pay a little bit more for
something like this because it has more
detail even though there are other
bikinis in prime are cheaper and more
affordable I'm glad I bought this one
because it's so pretty
I don't forgot to mention the glasses so
I'm gonna show you them now they're so
called very like retro kind of vintage
II looking I love them and they add
definitely a bit of pop of color to the
outfit these are only three pounds which
i think is so good this is my third
outfit and I do have to say it's
actually my favorite so far
I love this so much now I know this is
more like summarize kind of more like a
summer video this is very different and
you know it's a bit more covered up
before you know there's more chillier
days now in the UK you don't really know
when it's gonna be hot or not it's just
if it's hot happens to be hot that day
we didn't even have summer anymore it's
just absolutely everywhere so you never
know it's gonna be hot or not so you
need to be prepared this jumper I I love
so much like I would pay I would buy
this is that jumper they had at river
island cuz I loved it so much even if it
cost me 40 quid this was a 5 pounds
inside all it usually was 13 pounds but
it was reduced so
so excited and I didn't even know that I
got to the tail the jeans are so nice I
love the color so much and first I
wasn't too sure look I don't know if I
got them to blue but their jeans are
really really really nice super
flattering super comfy and finally the
shoes oh my goodness
now these don't actually fit me I'm I
like my feet I like so squash together
right now I've got too small of a size
I'm gonna go back in to the store to get
these I love them so much I would wear
this whole outfit any day so it's five
pounds for this the jeans were 13 pounds
other than these absolutely gorgeous
stunning kind of again like you know
Chanel looking and espadrilles worth 6
pounds which i think is crazy that blows
my mind
this is the companyís thing I have ever
worn in my entire life it is obviously a
3/4 length and clop play suit and it's
so like free it's a day to buy outfit as
you can see I'm wearing this wind Hills
right now but in the daytime you can
obviously wear these with trainers or
whatever you feel like
the shoes were 8 pounds and the playsuit
jumpsuit ever you want to call it was 13
pounds so I think it's pretty good and I
paired it with the sunglasses that I
thought were a little bit different and
with this gold rim they are so cool
and they were three pounds can I just
say as well how good are these shoes for
eight pounds sigh quantity Primark
delivering the shoes this season oh yeah
this is my perfect spring outfit
provider we've got nice weather it's
just so easy to throw on their shirt
dress it up to cover the belt as well
but I actually got mine kind of tied to
fit in so we can just sit like a loose
shirt obviously I've got on these
sliders again I have a reuse them for
this outfit and this is the cutest
backpack ever I love it so much the
patches are so so so cute even though I
do own a very nice backpack I would
still get wear of this because it's very
summer vibes and I love it and it looks
very cute this out there and again will
go with pretty much anything this bag it
was 10 pounds we're just so good even
this dressed you could even like if it
wasn't as hot you just put on like thigh
high socks or lonely high socks or you
know
even where of Hills like I would
generally where the shut-eye was going
on evening so yeah overall I really like
this outfit I'm actually so surprised
that this denim jacket is nice and lawns
I own I love it so much everything about
it I love the cut at the bottom I love
the color I love the rips it's so cool
this jacket has me written all over it
and then picks up summer but but I did
I'm Shores as you can see they've got
the lace detailing and then I put back
on these and Valentino looking sandals
which are very cute dr awesome heads oh
yeah this outfit so chilled very like
every typical summer day excuse that
I've got a green bra with the top I
should have probably taken off but you
know this shop was four pounds which is
pretty cheap this jacket was 20 pounds
the shorts who had 12 pounds and then
obviously I've showed you guys yeah
berry and last outfit so this one I've
got a red body see with this denim
jacket again and then the shorts are
really curious about because they have
like these little beaded flowers which
is so pretty
last but not least I have these heels
that I think are so nice then an
actually got the outfit I think cuz I
read I thought there was going to but
they definitely do not want good
together
I do actually really like the shoes
though they are definitely juice for the
Valentino here what I do actually want
the real version solved but there I'm
see a lot more expensive so and at least
they're gonna have to do for now but I
do overwatch EVD like them and they're
really pretty and finally guys that the
shoes were 14 pounds there we go there
is my seven outfits and honestly I was
so surprised like I love Primark anyways
but they have blown me away
I actually think why don't you would say
I pretty much liked all the outfits that
there was a lot better than I was
expecting them to be and I was actually
quite pleasantly surprised I mean to be
honest prymaat never failed me anyways
but yeah I actually really enjoyed the
office that I cook so I wasn't too sure
on them at first
anyways I really hope you guys did enjoy
