know you guys like to stock up last time
so we're back in the office for today's
video I went shopping in supermarkets I
hope we both the clothes from different
supermarkets I bought stuff from Tesco
Sainsbury's littles our D and finally
after it was actually so I was getting
so much but I don't ever see so much fun
I mean I love shopping so I'm gonna find
it fun but it was definitely interesting
some of the shops I was pleasantly
surprised that the points I was
pleasantly surprised some of it I was a
bit disappointed
there wasn't much option but I don't
want to tell you what I think overall
just yet so what you to watch the video
and obviously you guys let me know down
in the comments what you thought did you
like the clothes and would you go and
shop there some of the shots honestly I
just didn't even realize so close so I
was so surprised and I haven't seen
anyone do this for the over yeah so I
really hope you guys do enjoy it let us
go with shopping
there's a shop we are going to go to
littles I don't know you know if they
sell clothes in there though I'm really
hoping they do they might sell sometimes
maybe a huge range whatever they have if
I can get a full outfit I'm gonna buy it
right shop one let's do it
there we go we managed to find the
clothes and can I just say this is the
most untidy area of cause I've ever seen
in my entire life like everything is
everywhere there is no organization
so I'm looking I feel like this is gonna
be a little bit of a struggle there is a
much option so we're just gonna have a
little loser out no or these definitely
too big they will not fit okay I think
we also go to dream child so they know
the only trousers like the feet so maybe
we're gonna have to get these this is
the shoe selection over here
love that the problem is if you like
these shoes but I've only got Huseyin
trousers to go with them so then they go
right I've got my stuff and I'm ready to
go to OD let's do it
I can't actually believe like those
clothes in here I'm actually in looks
back you like the place before like fuck
I've been here before this is cube but
like I'm just not really sure it's me I
don't know I don't really love the
writing so we're gonna give that one a
minute it'll be a bit too fast huh well
you favourite too fuzzy
we are on our way to Tesco's and I'm
praying that Ted Cruz is good to me
please please please because of it I
think this is gonna be one of the better
shops because I know that they actually
sound like proper clothes they have a
closed section so please Tesco's it
would mean so much
it's got the goods I've got two
different bands and they're actually
quite full also well here we go
okay so Sainsbury's is actually looking
quite positive I think this one's gonna
be the most promising so let's give it a
go add stuff
good morning everyone and welcome to day
one I thought I would get the words out
of it out of the way
in fact I do use all my bad it's a
one-piece or a super super super comfy
which is really great because you know
I've got a lot of things to do today
I've got a lot of errands to get done
I'm ready to get the day done I need to
head to town I'm gonna walk the dog
so let's go but the shoes it's gonna be
so embarrassing I've got a one-piece
because there was literally nothing else
to have and/or get from the shop so this
is what we are going for you know what
it's super comfy it kind of feels like
quite thin and cheap but to be honest it
was I think the price being how much
this was however I think this is gonna
be great because I've got so much
planned today and so I thought this
could be nice and comfy the only thing
is the only option we have is well ease
unfortunately for possessive anything
that and store right these bad boys are
so just waiting for mom to get in the
car about to leave to go to town I have
to get a few bits mum has to get a few
bits um so let's go right so tom was a
success I did get a few stairs not as
many as I thought which is good I'm now
gonna walk my dog a fella over here no I
think it's just like eager to walk now
you know what the end the outfit was so
confident wasn't a one-piece I think I
would work like every single day like if
I could get away with it the wedding so
they did feel a bit cheap and honestly
they're a bit too big for me but as I
said there wasn't really many sizes to
choose from it's actually boiling and my
feet are sweating in these boots like
England is never sunny in all of the
sudden the sun's out today and I'm
wearing a one-piece and wellington boots
so my feet are very uncommon it's super
comfy
just when you thought it couldn't get
any worse there's like two groups of
football teams here so I'm going to
disguise I'm I'm sober she just goes to
me it's actually kind of embarrassing
like how dare you good morning everyone
today's outfit is from Sainsbury's I
actually decided to go with a tomb
outfit for this look just because I knew
that one day I needed to go to the gym
and I didn't want to make it unfair and
I didn't want to you know like put my
jumpers on the other day because then I
won't be wearing the whole outfit for a
day so today I actually get to go to the
gym which I'm so excited about because I
love the gym I just love working out
gets me in such a good mood so I imagine
gonna be wearing my gym outfit the whole
day and I'll show you it in the mirror
however I don't really mind because I
feel like what I actually put up on
earlier before I go to the gym it just
makes me motivated it makes me actually
like be bothered to go because in the
morning we're always like oh I want to
go to the gym and by the evening I'm
like yeah I cover bubble it anymore but
I think because I'm gonna be having this
on all day I'll actually end up going so
I'm actually gonna start the day off but
going to get my nails done because they
very much need to be done I'm gonna go
and get this painted at the nail shop
I'm gonna drive there now and then I'm
gonna go to the gym this is my outfit
for today by the way my hair's like this
only because I'm going to the gym I
would normally go out like this and then
yeah so this is my outfit I actually got
like a coordinates are so cute I love
them so much they're so nice they feel
like good material they feel nice and
thick the gym trainers I didn't really
have much option with and there was only
two different pairs to choose from and
also the leggings are slightly big as
well so they're a little bit
unflattering but they feel like really
good material as I said they feel like
stretchy and thick and same with the top
as well
the only thing is it's a bit I don't
know I kind of like you know when gym
tops are a bit looser so they kind of
hang and it's a bit tight but yeah it
feels good so that's what madam I just
got my nails done how cute do they look
I love this color so much very summery
dang
Wow excuse the big sweaty mess that I am
but it's a lot entering the day and it's
actually got so sunny which is so nice
however it made me sweat so much in the
gym however I do feel like it could also
partly be this gym gear because it's
quite thick material honestly the
leggings are so stretchy like they're so
nice to workout in the shoes are really
comfy as well like honestly wouldn't
fault the shoes I would go and buy them
however they're not as comfy as the gym
shoes that I usually use because they're
a bit more expensive and they have a bit
more like and giving them a bit more
kind of like spurring so I find it easy
but yeah again
still the shoes actually really really
really comfy overall I actually really
really really like this outfit and I
wouldn't mind having to workout in it
again good morning everyone
this outfit is all from Tesco and it's
probably one of my favorite ones I've
worn so far I really like the top it
says allo whore on it and it has these
slightly little pom-pom things and
they're very cute their jackets cute I
like the jeans I don't normally wear
expensive jeans anyway so I really like
these and they have like these sequins
here they're really really really pretty
the jeans I've really comfy so far so I
really really really like the jeans
however I don't know what they're going
to be like the whole day I'm hoping they
stay comfy and the shoes I just don't
like at all they like I can't explain it
but they don't come firth enough back it
looks really strange so I don't like the
shoes but I like the rest of the outfit
I've got a busy day ahead of me today
I'm going to London I've got some
meetings so let's go
like actually really comfy however the
only things I don't know if you guys can
see this but they keep twisting yeah
that seems to think it's pretty annoying
and also the shoots are very
uncomfortably I can't refrain testers
that it's just that they're new shoes
you know they're so unhappy yeah they
are weird that I really have to clean
hard so this outfit today is from Asda
and you know I actually really really
really like this outfit I love the top I
think it's really cool it says Malibu
and it's like a pastel pink and then I
just got some like darker kind of like
washed out pink shorts actually proving
to be really config they're not like
really super thick denim which is nice
and then I got some converse look-alikes
and actually they look so much like
converse it's kind of crazy
I actually bring this so nice I love
these and I think there are about 10
pounds so if you were to get these over
converse you're like paying obviously a
lot cheaper I think there's some if if
these were 10 pounds of converse are
about 50 Bryce you save something like
40 pounds so I actually own converse and
I do think well I've got these and
honestly they basically look the same
and they're actually really really
really nice I'm gonna go and see what my
family thinks of it bright guys I just
want to ask what do you think of my
outfit today why am I asking you well
just what do you think of it like do you
think it's a guy would normally wear do
you like it no you asked yep thank you
very much yes see I really like the top
thinking things are the same color it's
quite cool but they're not just like
right if it is the same color when it
looked like I've done I think I'd be a
bit weird but what would you say if I
said that this is from Tesco's this out
there
no reason that's a lies for my stuff
whoa Nicole I don't know I mean just
look like is it George
yeah yeah good morning everyone and
welcome to the last day of me wearing a
supermarket clothes today's outfit is
from littles this is my outfit from
little it's definitely comfy to say the
least
like I felt free class right now I feel
great
also excuse the hair again it's another
day where like running around with tons
of likes on meetings I would like drop
some merch off I've got a lot to do so
yeah this is why I look like this right
now I've just got lots of editing to do
indoors as well
so bonus things will bonus point this is
actually gonna be like great for do my
editing and my meetings and stuff today
because I'm just gonna be so confident
overall and it's great to just lounge in
having said that I'm really really
really hate that outfit it's just not me
it's not something I would normally wear
I feel like a mum of 55 children my
brother won't be in the vlog but I just
asked him what I what he thinks of my
outfit and he just says that I look like
an American what you don't know what
that means I think he means like a an
older American there's like ghosts of
Denny's or something I don't know I
actually love dad he's still gonna like
but that's a party what I look like so
I've always wanted to be an American so
it's great update the sun is shining I
have been sitting here for about three
hours doing some editing on my laptop
with my green tea which has been just
great however the only problem is my
living trousers are so quick like I'm
gonna have to actually REI in them
before I go back out so maybe limbing
trousers aren't the best things to wear
when you're just sitting around the
house
day so it's time to take all of this
whole oh my goodness
Marge there's so many more to come
just out of two very productive meetings
and you know what I was actually really
comfy however I did kind of feel a
little bit like a mum was in the
meetings and I don't know if it's just
me like overthinking things and but I
just felt that those probably they was
looking at me like what is she wearing
I'm it's not like a really ugly outfit
it's just not something I would normally
wear it just it makes it food older than
I am you know yeah it was really comfy
and I did have yeah it's not the v-neck
yeah could look cool with the cool top
right we're gonna go and drop the match
off now it brings it
today is quite a fair bit later now and
today has been very good do you know
what like honestly this outfit is it
very me but I've actually really really
really enjoyed wearing it because it's
just been so so so comfy I mean the legs
do look extremely creeps like honestly
is yeah you can't sit down and then
expect to wear them out it's just not
gonna happen without ironing them and
but overall I've actually really really
really enjoyed wearing this outfit
antonius I think some supermarket
clothes have actually been okay like I
thought you can wear see the market
price of the outfit only thing I would
say is I wouldn't have to recommend
going shopping in little or howdy just
because there isn't much of a variety
unless you want basics and however all
of the stores are actually a lot cheaper
than you know your normal average high
street store maybe like Primark prices
is still one actually that cheap but
yeah overall I'm actually quite
impressed and who do want to get worried
though hey howdy hit the door they have
them but yeah that was the end of the
video so let me know what you guys
thought it down in the comments below
and also vote in the poll up here know
what side it is but go and vote if you
actually think these stores were worth
going to get clothes from and let me go
through the edible clothes from any
supermarkets before know that I actually
occasionally shop and hands up some
people my hands up for that one oh wow
you know it's the same thing if you guys
are in America I think they have Walmart
in Australia too I'm not sure and the
hands up to that anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe and
like
see guys very soon five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
