winner today I am joined with Casey and
today we're actually going to be
exploding this pumpkin right here is why
but this pumpkin is absolutely oh it's
all you I decide to cater to be focused
on up big and then I double up snows
like issue so I've seen the watermelon
challenge before I basically what you do
is use wrap Browns
loads and loads and loads of it acid
bath and it explodes but I've never
rubber bands rather than elastic bands
are the same thing
same thing anyway you run me around and
what it does is it gets so tight and
then it explodes I've never ever seen
anybody do it for pumpkin they may have
done it before but I've never seen
anybody do it for pumpkin I don't think
so I do I do thought that's how they
were India let's just let's just try a
pumpkin it's so much thicker than a
watermelon though I have no idea if it's
gonna work but I really want to prove
Casey wrong so fingers crossed fingers
crossed so we've got one two three four
oh four Monica also we've got I think
five different packets of elastic bands
Roland okay write down for now if you
put it in that sick or grab another
thing I couldn't roll my boys called the
master bath oh yeah oh wait I have I
think yeah I think I have oh how many of
these you need is gonna say to explode I
think one of them I don't even know
really know so without further ado let's
get into this video what we're gonna try
and get a couple of them to go on twice
I think these ones these are you gonna
go wise or anyone's yeah these are good
knit time I guess it's been a very very
long video so did you know what I think
it's gonna work better if one of us hold
the pump while the other person elastic
band on okay I say you better
okay this is why I we need to get them
on top of each other and look you're not
oh yeah my uncle were we looking scrunch
them all down

bands I'm making 200 280 280 we really
lost count
