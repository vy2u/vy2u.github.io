brother's girlfriend Nicole oh who is
from Brazil so you were tower by her
actor which is amazing we are making
today it's time to move yeah trying to
make some gingerbread houses and we're
going to do this well stir like a
Christmas Q&amp;amp;A we got some questions from
Twitter as I tweeted saying all sorts of
questions and that's what those of you
guys did so we're going to do that
whilst trying to make these houses that
I think they fail Wow I hope it's your
work so no let's see we put inside now I
believe is a chocolate to buy houses
I've made a lot don't either
we've got some big big bag of chocolate
doctor's a little tuna to turn off my
goodness yes many collectors says that's
right now I staying home that's like a
pipe oh yeah we've got three candy canes
but straight ones that look pretty cool
all the cute International yeah many
much better Jesus oh yeah oh my god
there's more just like finishing only
for today this is a reduced 1/2 we got
this totally wrong I can get the
chocolate out of the enchanted cottage
care may be there for your own rocky
road veterans rating
no I actually did this Femina didn't
about our yeah I think
no Giza okay and before I believe either
Smarties like great Smarties that would
flow so cute so that's a lot ingredient
then we had this he are witches but I
wonder what to do it I need it right now
stencil right so the first instruction
says remove the biscuit and minnows from
their packets to wire the biscuit into
two and the marshmallows into three
piles so that's going back so remove the
big oh this could get messy
we're going to mush mush bit much merge
into by out into to the minute
difference so we just you know get the
can tape it in half there you go - and
that was a clever way okay I'll send
them all does it out yeah okay
three first down knowing that haha
hi-yah okay seconds up an empty the
first chocolate flavor candy into a
small bar a mile over a pan of warm
water make sure no water gets into the
bowl Santa's here you can approach to
the constant added up or vegetable oil
it's an entry for their engine up at all
yeah actually antique or was it into
that like at the same time it does yeah
some you oh you believe what we just did
okay well we will mentor for the
chocolate in the bowl but we put in the
sauce boom and now is mounted and it
stopped at the source burn I was
supposed to washing sauce when so
luminous without Rio right now you
probably hear the sauce but now we've
emptied the saucepan and put the
chocolate into a bowl and now we put the
water in the saucer okay so exactly I'm
strapped it in did the way for Ginza
quoting one at a time let the excess
drip it off with speed when it's jars
are playing a neat Sam okay so we need
to wait for that turn out so well for
that next answer one of our questions
what's your favorite thing about
Christmas my favorite thing about this
is I always have been like family
together
yeah that's why was a bit like
everyone's so happy on Christmas like if
we allow me to go out everyone like
wearing Christmas jumpers yeah by
yourself is someone else so we don't
want Christmas jumpers well
we're for yeah don't remember everything
about Christmas day is that everyone in
the family is so happy getting on so
well even me my brother's get on so well
and everyone's smiling Edwards has
actually don't definitely my favorite
thing what is your favorite Christmas
song they have so many hours because
I've always listened to Portuguese
Christmas home oh yeah yeah different so
I think oh how definitely both the
traditional merry just because I see a
more time have you heard me sing it oh
yeah I know
so in it goes even without such a moment
you can connect to him around the
husband every day I keep seeing this all
I am just loving too much I'm arrested
though yeah and it's impossible up my
hair although I do love a little mixed
undercover last year and it is amazing
and they're like video for it so passive
I'm so cute when I start with my
favorite laughs I know it's a game you
love and the very next day
that's a good girl I'm going to grow you
know I'm think of a traditional
Christmas song galavan's death because
that is like the most like festive ones
aren't they we get you down for it
that's so good
who's better at rapping yes now I favor
to this one because yesterday Nick
content compliments about - guess I was
like oh oh we would say I got here we go
like no much a boy I go back to the
regional rep own presence and resume
because we just get in Denver in sauce
so yeah like everywhere like in the cold
ocean the same to me they're like
they're just wrap it for you in the soil
yeah yeah we don't have to run yeah so
you owe us that moment at present was
let's hear where I'm two numbers that's
so weird
I like I got me a present they failed
every single time
I seem to do this thing if you see on
Jake's video that will be going up the
same day as this but I think I'll be up
in an hour's time we do a quiz wrapping
paper challenge ain't no crap and
everything I have a Christmas cracker
move that was the easiest way to do
rough around spitting oh I know
okay I'm calm at present so I'm going to
say I still think you'll be better no I
mean it's all good even come you guys
will never believe what we just stared
right but it looks like a jerk we have
learnt it so much because you wanna hang
out hurry up and now the pole it's
really hot if I say I quit I can't even
show you it was like out there it's like
oh god please are going to be there with
trees and one of the Christmas house I
don't always feel like I did it would I
have to do it from a bar I would try oh
my god I'm actually gonna try so I'm not
don't be a penis well this is my idea
but is that gonna cover it oh yeah oh
yeah
are these gonna miss my pins up or this
is gonna watch me Oh No yeah just feel
your fingers but my fingers a fit inside
oh yeah
one of the questions I remember they're
sort of watch your Christmas floating
and lipsticks basically what's your
favorite lipstick Christmas type ones
definitely getting regenerate read and
perhaps their collar in my hair no I'd
say I have laid into my map it's a
really really nice bright red is so so
nice and they got done I really like
Russian rather Maxwell yeah that was
really like really smart and died bread
I loved you I never noticed
I'm wearing it cause it's thick right
now I'm she got this I think two days
ago is like yes an or we had you not
shade is alright I just pictured below
we find it out it's like a orange II
pinky but yeah it's over nice but it's
like for anything later soul yeah yeah
we burn it what I've been wearing this
for Chi videos now like I had to stop in
the last year that I found we got out of
the codes okay so another question what
is your favorite Christmas film like
it's definitely Alf and home oh yeah you
call a good role like they are the best
big men and from Zoo homologs let me
classic yes and so good you can't normal
kind of I love ours I like it yeah sorry
yeah girl I watch it like there are
movies i watch every single year okay
yeah to get it in the movie
definitely definitely although I do want
to find more Christmas sale I want to
know
so only watch that every years and then
let's see if we go any Christmas bulbs
allows overdoses I really really want to
find some more good ones okay so this
next stage yeah I think we have to put
all the chocolate out and if I die or
disease yeah yeah it's good you've got
like a lobby solo
yeah it's like a job now yeah it's a
right here great Oh No what's your
favorite Christmas drink no I am a
really really fancy each other's a lot
of you guys may know so I just love hot
chocolate
it's the best and Starbucks hot
chocolate is my favorite thing when you
get it creamy
Oh making love in this amazing we only
get cold drinks because it's 7l it's
like 30 degrees so unfortunately we
can't have hot chocolate oh I couldn't
have a solid rock weather no we won't
have a cold drink what would you have a
Christmas time just a normal drink dad's
origins you know just enough that's so
good is enough chocolate as well
Oh oh my goodness why just watch whoa
Johnny boy half just one square one
trifle to make a house we're going to
need to train we're going to need four
triangles but Regents save only laughter
we use all of the chakra we make one
house don't use up a perimeter line do
you have any Christmas traditions okay
that's a fun one because it's a good one
for you yeah because in Brazil we
actually celebrate Christmas when forth
so we're way to midnight so we can walk
in and open a present so I know it isn't
it is it's so weird like they have them
as this August 24 yeah we have like a
special did but at 4:00 p.m. so
practically actor in there yeah we have
expected in and in 24 then we all wait
until midnight so we can oh good that's
when Santa comes so it is the 25th oh we
do have special we're going along we
were supposed to go the fierce Caroline
roads in it
that's why we've had leftover chocolate
so as we said at the kidding we're
failing on this but don't you worry we
will we do this only so I think I'm
going to do is just come by this up and
just put it in an hour just one house
this is definitely going to be Betty
mommy Road well what matters is the
places and I guess that's what it's all
about guys it tastes good it is good
look at my hands and check your chicken
now I eat chicken probably every single
day as it's my life I'm gonna take my
rude but how bad a place it is as it's
written healthy and it's just so long
it's not right me it's really good for
you but turkey is my favorite meat as
well as lamb Turkey and now all the best
so I love to say because we never ever
have to have your mommy have a roast on
a Sunday so same token I think don't
because as we still have everything in
succession yeah that's why it is so good
no if I go to cooperate they always have
talking so know how to do the codes and
I have feared as good as over all I'm
able to make oh it can't go anymore mom
yeah no another question was if you can
spend Christmas anywhere in the country
where defendant they were English and I
would spend mine probably in New York
cause I love foie gras is supposed to be
an amazing time for Christmas and so my
definitely New York I am trying to do
like a Christmas tree but it's not
working very well if they wanted to
smartass on top and there is my
Christmas tree I'm a Kirby it thank you
who's the person to wake up in your
heart Christmas now it's kind of change
every single dare I would probably say
my ultimate case is actually the birds
won't wake up because I was set an alarm
for this obviously Christmas dog day as
much as I was ruined
my Christmas present like I need to have
my seats occasionally wake myself up and
then we go wake Jed up and then make our
parents up and like Jenna's definitely
the quickest one to get out of bed like
even though the last ones we poppers jet
chicken sleeps like the whole world is
Lee he's like you gets so excited to
process an every Christmas genitals ill
because then he gets so excited he just
gets up straight away
every Christmas this Christmas will be
ill oh my god like I'm not jinxing
effort here or me or in the exams
etiquette virtuousness
it's because he gets so excited so I
have just got my it out of the fridge
and it's hot and I think it will be okay
although it's a big food big mess right
now click on it New York and think yours
may be a lot better than mine because
mine is not too great for Museum look so
he'll be champions rocky road so it does
look good let's see yours
that's my ah quite cool you're just more
common and chocolate mindful you know I
love you very miss kitty but I think
they're gonna be so good let's go go go
yeah oh yes much line
after that I told you guys who would do
this what oh my god it's not amazing and
it feels on any day and oh my god we've
done it without that what here's a door
I think got two doors now oh my god it's
blazing 1 and we only have hope right so
I needed to take only neither whatever
we need identify protonation is the main
thing we need to go down are you doing
I'm so confused oh is like that that's
correct
shoka this one on the bottom no but we
need the other one over there Twitter
from outside
a table the movie now if we can loads of
those icing I think in my Java and then
to the people folder that like doesn't
look we need you turns out main things
yeah good okay so another question was
have your G plans you all Christmas
outfits oh my god I've been deafening
about that every day I've been acting
sup yeah yeah like don't do not good
over Christmas actually have them always
do it I have no idea that thing is the
reason I have no ideas because normally
like my mum gets me for Christmas I can
outfit for me too well Christmas Day and
so no we hadn't actually planned it
through the day which is weird some
people I would obviously rather wear a
new outfit I've just got and she's
always like pants a whole outfit and top
the bottom so I don't know what I waited
for today normally until Christmas there
when I might have something they end up
in change so I'm thinking about yeah
yeah I mean the beginning of the day you
won't jamÃ¡s yeah it was like I wanted
to get some glittery that I want to wear
to the trip from New Year's buy more -
Sean do you got that stop and on the top
of your journey now some people wait and
so many people mention this to me in my
vlog and when they see my Christmas tree
and we haven't had to start and or what
we never do the pottery is so big but
like we just don't need one like it's so
big and it's cool
so me like has 1600 lights laundry which
is insane so we don't actually but but I
think I prefer to angel just because
it's so cute daddy
youngji favorite into our I usually
again stop this is it so this one
sitting inside on okay so the bit of a
dirty shame thought it is you know if
it's in this position it looks good sure
it's yummy
I mean the side of it down even it is a
bit rubbish but you know we try and I'm
sure it ain't amazing and that got
really now it will really thought much
fun it was so much my views it was so
funny messed up so time as you could
tell yeah it was great fun so hope you
guys enjoyed it's more of a chatty video
I think it's a bit different to most
videos and all we do if you enjoyed and
want to see more tattoos videos like
