channel now for today's video I have got
a huge winter high street clothing haul
would you excites me so much because you
guys know how much I love shopping I
usually do whole videos like every
single month and I can't remember the
last time I acted in haul for you guys
probably wasn't that long ago but for me
it feels like ages ago because I haven't
done this in such a long time so I am so
so so excited there's kind of like a bit
of everything in this video and I mean a
majority of it that is what I'm doing
why in front winter but there's a little
bit of everything so I really hope you
guys do enjoy and majority of it is
affordable as well so perhaps you guys
oh and there's a lot of different like
styles and stuff as well so hopefully
this video should be great for everybody
if you guys do like a good old whore
then smash a like and subscribe down
below if you guys haven't already and
without further ado let's get into the
video but quickly this is the first
thing but I just come possess if I
really wanted to wear it so I'm wearing
this jumper right now so this jump I
mean it's you're obsessed with that
connection my weights from now let me
have a look it might be with island
let's take a look Bashkir birch play it
was Michael that's struggle $24.99 which
I thought was pretty good because I feel
like if jumpers do the job and it's one
of them looking like cute if they are
like thick and comfy and keep you warm
then you're clearly gonna wear them a
lot so I feel like 25 pounds is really
good and you guys know that I'm loving
this kind of like muscle dean yellow
color this this entire year to be honest
so I'm obsessed with this and it's
really really really Posey it's not too
big the size I've got as well so I'm
loving it so so much and I love this
like cross detailing I don't really know
what it is but all the John pers I seem
to be buying at the moment have this
same kind of pattern on it it's just
that kind of like knitted look pattern
I'm not exactly sure what this is called
I would just call it a knitted look jump
upper I think if we like Erin I don't
know what this style is if any of you
guys do it know then please let me know
but you know why what about this kind of
like cross detailing knitted look I
think it's so cute
very autumnal very wintery I literally
love it so barca
thank you so this is the next on part
this is actually my favorite jumper like
ever I
in my recent video if you guys saw that
so again it's just another chunky winter
jumper it's like Willy and knitted it
looks so cute so this is what it looks
like I really like tics it's just a
little bit different I really really
really love the pop of color but then
you still have you know the black white
and gray I own too much but quite grey
so they know but a stash of color I
thought that's better that will fit nice
through my wardrobe this is what it
looks like and then this is kind of just
like a high-neck like this is probably
like the same pie is it it's really
curious so it's so so cozy on and I love
it it's from River Island
think this one was a little bit more
expensive I think this was this was 42
pounds so this one was in a bit more
pricey but again I know I'm gonna get a
lot of wear out of there and it's really
really really warm also as well as I can
keep and then it's some other bits I got
from River Island
this is soaked for okay so many people
so a lot of people saw this saw these
trousers like only the tiniest bit in an
Instagram picture and the amount of
people was like several where are they
from
so now I'm telling you they're from
River Island so these are the trousers
look like let me just do the bow one sec
these are pencil style trousers because
they're very narrow but they're not like
skin type they have this elasticated
waist which i think is so nice because
it's like a lot more flattering and then
it has like a big bow here which it just
looks really pretty you tie up so this
is kind of what it looks like they're
very very very smart but I felt like you
can still rock them out of a pair of
trainers or like I don't know if I was
going to like a red carpet event or
whatever I could definitely wear these
with a pair of hair looks like I feel
like I can wear these with anything so
it's really nice like to dress it up or
dress them down I feel like I just own
too many jeans I'm kind of sick of
wearing jeans now like I'm so over it I
just want to wear different style
trousers plus trousers like this I think
there's so much more comfy than it jeans
as well so these were definitely a must
and these were let's take a little look
35 pounds I mean to me for 35 pounds is
quite expensive for trousers but I paid
that much for my jeans anyway and plus
it's like you can wear them day to night
you can wear them with heels or you can
wear them of trainers whatever so I've
got like a we'll go again a lot of wear
out these
okay so moving on the last thing that I
got from River Island which again Oh
actually obsessed my mom pip I mean to
be fair my mum picked most of my clothes
I know that so bad but my mom has such a
good fashion sense I know she's going to
love you saying that okay so this is the
tapas sorry cute oh my god I just I love
it I've actually upset you guys be like
why are you freaking out over a top well
you wait you wait so this is what it
looks like it's like a basic like slogan
t-shirt but it says 'saturday keeps the
basics away I love the fact the sack is
literally thering like if you feel it
it's the softest thing and it's oh my
god I just love it so much you know how
much I love bread as well and I feel
like mine love smoking tops but
sometimes they're a little bit too basic
no this one this one shows my SATs so
this was for 24 pounds it's a little bit
extra money but I feel like the top is a
little bit extra so I am loving this so
thank you rev Ireland because you guys
will be seeing me wearing this a lot
technically that's not my laughing that
I got from River Island I wasn't going
to show you guys this but I just think
it's so cute that I kind of have to so
the reason I wasn't gonna show you this
jumper is because it's actually a
Christmas jumper it says hohoho with a
little pom-poms little ball boards here
that I think are the cutest things ever
I love it fell in love with it straight
away the reason I did want to show you
guys this it's just because I'm gonna be
doing like a huge Christmas drama home
with like over 30 jumpers or whatever so
I kind of wanted to leave it all to one
video but here's a little sneak peek of
what a jumpers so I've got this one
problem island and I put it in this size
medium I just think it also looks really
cooked tree because inside it's like
really soft as well so this was 28
pounds so again I mean yeah isn't it
with pricey but I just really like it
things I rather pay a little bit more
and get something I love and I know that
I'm gonna wear a lot rather than it's
just kind of average and I probably
won't wear it so that's why I look at it
anyways we are moving on oh wow there
was a job where they're just free from
heaven have a look
that this jumper my mom screw just
thrown it at me because I can't miss
this out because I've taken I sit back
I've worn this jumper to a meet and
greet before I've worn it and Sony like
vlogs and Instagram pics they don't
follow minutes around you definitely
should
so there's amount of people that ask me
this and it genuinely like the jumpers
I've already shown you yet they are soft
but this is another level and by the way
it's kind of dirty so I think I wore it
a couple of days ago and I haven't put
it in the wash jack so it's this cream
knit jumper again it has that same
design on it but it is genuinely I can't
even explain how soft it is like is so
soft so catchy I am obsessed and it's
from Primark Thank You Primark Primark
you guys know it's my favourite straw
you should definitely shop there it ka
get my earth Saffy be better get there
selfie be arranged but no it's it's just
the best thing ever I don't know how
much this was I'm 10 pounds it was 10
pound there you go 10 pounds what a
bargain and I just remembered the wall
that this is made from is called Chanel
it's like a really really really soft
ball so next up from misguided is this
knitted beanie with a little pom-poms on
the top
I am literally in love they're so cute
I love anything like I love accessories
that have my fur on it I just think it's
so cute if I'm buying like any sort of
cry or anything it will always be faux
fur but I don't mean real fur like
literary faux fur I'm obsessed I think
it looks so cute I'm gonna like this
isn't gonna look good now this is my
hair looks awful
oh my god I'm already doing a justice
right now but it is actually cutest
thing ever when my hair is half decent
this is so cute I love it it's from
misguided it wasn't too expensive I
don't think but I can't remember how
much it was so everything I'm gonna try
and leave down below for you guys if you
want to check them out so that's all
misguided misguided misguided then I
also got all the other hats downstairs
I'm just asked my mom she's gonna go
fetch it for me so I got this scarf and
hat that came back as a matching set so
it's called like a pom pom matching set
Sookie so this is the scarf with the
little pom-poms at the end the faux fur
which is so cute and then the Hat
this is
that's like so it's pretty much similar
to the other half that I showed you but
it's got one big pom-pom at the top and
it just goes really really really nicely
with the scarf and again I put this on
my Instagram and so many people asking
where it's from I think it was 15 pounds
and that is really cute that it comes to
the set because I always try and match
my hats my scarf anyway it's get moving
on now we are gonna go with first curve
again okay I've actually spoke about
these trousers quite a lot because I
have them in like a cocky green color
and I also have them in black like
different stripes down the side I as I
said I'm just kind of sick of wearing
jeans now so any chance if I like any
other trousers I'm just gonna get them
like there's there's no hesitating about
it so these are like my favorite things
ever because they're so cozy again you
can wear them in the daytime in the
nighttime you can dress them up with a
pair of heels you can weather the move
you can wear them with trainers I've
done again both I've worn these in the
evening and in the day many many times
not these color though not this clear so
they are burgundy these ones again they
have an elasticated wait can't seem to
get that word out elasticated that's the
word that's the case it oh my goodness
okay right whatever
waist you know I'm trying to say now so
have this way so it's really really
really flattering and cook I'm like just
easy to wear again
and they're also pencil fitted so
they've tied to at the bottom and they
folded up as well they're really cute I
love the stripes that go down the side
they're just very very very me and will
they over me so have the other colors
and I wear them so much either aren't
too expensive either I think these are
are they're 23 pounds which isn't
actually that bad because I do wear them
in the day and at night I love them I go
long where are these so thank you Berta
for those trousers this is more of like
a basic jumper this again is from
Primark so I thought it was really nice
so because you guys know how much I love
the color of red and it's a really cute
because it can just tuck into things I
think it's just like if you're just
really undersized it doen't ought to
wear this is just really like a
lightweight jumper that you can just
kind of wear anything so it's right I
also have it unlike a mustard color as
well and it's shorter at the front and
it's longer in the bag honestly I just
need this one of really cute tucked into
things
this was eight pounds I may go in a size
eight now I know a lot of you guys
definitely would recognize this jacket
because I pretty much wear every single
day on my vlogs because it's the
kookiest jacket my own and also it's
just really warm and I just think it's
so nice and this color again is so this
season so I'm kind of like obsessive
this puffer jacket the whole style I
love it so I can't exactly remember I
think it might have been like 65 pounds
it's from Urban Outfitters this is what
it looks like it's like just a big
puffer jacket kind of like that mustardy
color but it looks really cool with
pretty much anything and I just think
it's really really really catchy and
also it's waterproof it does actually
have a hood but I've only discovered the
other day that you just like untuck from
here and that is a hood as well so it's
raining it's also great for that but
yeah I'm literally like I live and die
in this like this is the best thing ever
they also join so many different colors
I really really want to get it in the
road when I first got it I was so
indecisive I was like the red mustard I
don't know would want to get I was so
close to getting both and I say I can't
do that but now now I realize how much I
wear this one I'm like yeah maybe I'm
gonna have to go and get the road they
also have a baby blue color as well
which is also very cute so new stuff
from Urban Outfitters which is very
pricey but it is gonna be because it is
Tommy Hilfiger so obviously like it's
the designer but Tommy Hilfiger is
actually one of my favorite designer
favorite designers I loved it so much so
this is what the jumper looks like it
just says Tommy jeans on the front I
just thought it's really cute I love
this style of jump up and out the hood
yes like just a sweatshirt basically I
just I just love sweatshirts and also
again it's really cooked you like inside
I mean it's gonna be it's really really
really soft and then on the back is a
kind of basic I guess in the back it's
just like playing great but I just also
love gray and just love gray black white
gray or by way too much of it and then
another thing that I got so this is from
misguided this is one of those things I
was kind of unsure about because I
didn't know I feel like it could look
kind of like chavvy or something like if
you wore of a back and really got
Oakland well as a jogger this I would
look awful
but if you kind of style it out it could
look really cool
I would actually try this on yet so once
I do actually try it on let me know what
you guys think
whether it's like a keeper or a sweeper
so this is one that is definitely a love
or hate I literally love these hats and
I wasn't sure if I was gonna like put it
off but I feel like they actually do I'm
obsessed I don't care what other people
say this is a Baker boy hat these are
used to be really fashionable then we're
really out of fashion in another so in
fashion again so this is what it looks
like I don't really know how to describe
it apart from its it's a baby boy hat I
just think they're so cute actually guys
can see this is been wearing it right
now walking on it there is the end of
the video this hall wasn't actually as
huge as I thought it would be I think so
I spent so much money that I'm forever
gonna be poor and I think maybe I've
bought more than I actually did maybe
the thing is they're a little bit more
pricey than I expected to be but I'm
actually really really really happy with
all of my purchases let me know down
below what was your favorite thing that
