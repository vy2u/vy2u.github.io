launch of Michelle Keegan's new Lipton
range and I'm so excited it's in London
and I'm getting picked up in half an
hour and today I'm wearing this Lipsy
top but they kinda send me which I love
it's an off the shoulder top
I stupidly take my bass drop down but
we're not there yet so I don't need to
it's gonna be a really good day and I'm
really excited and as you know it's a
Wednesday
so my new videos are at 6 p.m. which I'm
so excited for I actually love this
video I don't know my brother and I love
it so much and I'm loving them now as
well so I will show you guys that this
is the thumbnail for my new video which
I love so much
I'm so excited if you ought to see it
obviously hopefully you would have seen
it already if you're subscribed to me
and so yeah I love this one so much and
I love this video so really hope you
guys enjoy it so there's one bad thing
though the I think my wishes when the
weather outside is disgusting so I'm
dreading chasing our taxi or uber or
whatever we're getting them to get there
well I can see you outside now here's
the little pink car once again and the
weather outside is absolutely a horrible
so yeah and also basically I'm not sure
we have to wear this I love this because
I love fur coats and stuff all my
leather jacket what I think I'm gonna do
is put my another jacket underneath so
when I get there I could take it off see
that's my Dixon it's more dressier this
is a bit cash but then I love fur also
my like I have eye kills I'm taking with
me they're like thick kills not tiny
lines as I said before I can't walk with
dying ones and but I'm going in trainers
and I'm just going to change and I'm on
the train because I need to be calm walk
around them they literally ate my feet
so much so that's why I'm going to put
in so I've got to be doing a lot of
changing and swapping around when I get
there waxey not really that much
changing a couple of things anyway and I
just need to find my watch and I should
pretty go because she's outside so I'm
gonna go and I will see at the train

coming off and a half Doritos are off
especially as we're gonna be in London

to find a lipstick and like I love
Revlon's lipsticks so I'm looking for
them I don't actually know where they
are lipstick is yes well why am i
walking that way I do not know where are
my bloomers
okay so I have just spent like 15
minutes trying to choose the lipstick
color because the color I wanted they
didn't actually have some right now I've
gone like five different lipstick colors
but I'm actually like me overall but I
don't want to fly five to the lipstick
so I've just got one at random because
they don't seem to have the one that I
love so yeah I'm not sure that's gonna
work alone I hope it was nice anyway
