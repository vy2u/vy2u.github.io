and also I always wear like not me I
never wear that bad now it's not that
bad it's just you know that it's you
you say my god I think they're like you
on anyway I'm confident I'm gonna be
confident in my outfit that is my own by
100 oh my that is expensive and
obviously I love it that is a lot of
money it's nobody's an author outfit
like this bag gets sweet but it's just I
just wouldn't let you know that I don't
wear this sort of bag it's not me so
that's why it's family just things they
had in there that was it you take your
deck chair and we're gonna move on it to
dad the bees outfit you ready it's not
addressing this is this is proper no no
it's gonna wear that is it that is
barren did you have frozen knickers and
supplement to it you've got 50 pills for
that that is I'll tell you what anyone
can pull that off so you can does that
look like a debt yet no look at that
it's like silk is a horrible fabric is
your silk but it's not it's not a deck
chair that was in it II don't know Brian
deck chair hold ah look at that
beautiful that flows anyway let's move
on oh and look at that
I think realize there was this much
material that's just not something that
I would wear and that you know what it
is
this could go either way it could to
come in ability as in a way to go if you
want audiences these shoes they should
have been in high heels so I got these
they made a halfpipe in within H&amp;amp;M today
these are the spots up and these are
moon boots and they you know if you go
to the best you've ever done now and
prepare if you've got heels or wedges
its can I just quickly have a look at
those if you've got heels or wedges like
Val victors but really cool but I'm like
the shortest person ever and they look
really long and what I like the shoes
but I just don't know with the outfit
dad what would you think in bless your
heart done
so it's not really expensive to show and
it's actually really good no biggest
different shades of pinks is kind of
clashes this is what makes it I called
it the honeycomb bag because when you
first see it you might love
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
the scary on touch rings
but do not the base on it do that the
shoes the skirt is all think if it came
with shorts it would be so much nicer
but I think you could just wear jeans go
in the top
actually they are absolutely beautiful
compared to this Wow
so which pick another think I figured
out I love this this is nothing
carnation
I decide okay if there was other things
up the pebble in the shot okay well
let's find out saving the winner I mean
I love the shoes are the trousers
this is huge oh that's sweet well I
actually think it's already goes down on
the note safety measures oh yeah it's a
baby epic old lady way too big

could be mama to be fair so yeah it's
really hard to tell because you've got
way too a big other side yeah yeah Wow
