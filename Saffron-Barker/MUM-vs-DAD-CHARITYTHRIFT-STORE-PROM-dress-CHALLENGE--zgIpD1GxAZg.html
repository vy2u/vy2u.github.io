channel again I'm joined my parents so
it feels like forever and go they were
done one of these videos and I think it
was anyway so you guys remember posting
more videos like this don't you enjoy
them so I've done more videos like this
where mom versus dad basically go face
to face and they have to choose me the
best outfit they can whether this is on
a budget whether it's in a particular
store today we decided to do a charity
thrift store version we have done this
before
however we're doing it for prom yeah
I've been stitched out yeah but you know
the church shops out I won't even I went
in to little shops I'm normally very
confident on little ways but well I'm a
it might be closest I've got you into
custody now shops in Brighton and some
of them are really good so I think it's
not actually gonna be that hard I've
never seen no really nice clothes in
there but do you have any prompt stuff
in this okay it might be amazing
progress there's my exercise and some
really nice shoes over oh yes look at oh
my god they're like a size three I think
sometimes I it's like I can see now my
shoes so the charity shops they have
like amazing I've been hitched up as
well but it's again the same thing is
that one size anyways I really hope you
guys do enjoy this and if you're going
to prom this year then let me know down
in the comments below because I'm
intrigued and I miss my prom so much
anyways I really hope you guys do enjoy
really quickly last thing before we get
into it YouTube have kind of changed the
thing where you don't actually see
videos in a subscription boxes at all
now unless you kick the bow so subscribe
and without further ado let's get into
the video
what so I want to go fast I mean mom
said you go first okay right let's get
cracking I've actually parked right
outside this charity shop here
and actually without even going in I can
see already that there are progress in
the windows that I'm hoping it's going
to be first shot lucky did not working
towards no as I as planned but there's
another one just on here and I am
begging that this one is better
I really do not want to spend my whole
day go the nacho shop
[Laughter]
oh yes I have found loads of prom
dresses I am in heaven right now and I
think the most expensive white wall it's
30 pounds but you know it's good this is
good okay that definitely was in heaven
basically there's loads of money shots
not 50 no shoes makeup is on relatively
safe
crying
me
I think about is my favorite charity or
arches country house which of them
something that we've always supported a
bike so consider it
completely charity shop town I managed
to get some shoes and another one but
I've just got a back to go and I have
been in a hundred thousand shops I'm so
over it now so as you would have seen I
went too low I was a child he shopped
out and had to say I am gonna go to
charity shops more often from now on cuz
I got some cool but not necessarily well
that's a nice comes up with whatever
this is gonna figure out oh no okay just
fit in high when I'm getting to like
three different shops at the end so
we're gonna start at the back it wasn't
there was a dress but it is really nice
it's a lot money but then yeah so I
thought you know actually runs I love my
prom dress a little bit I know I had a
different color but it's quite similar
or anything like a prom dress well I
don't know but it looks like one that I
was worth anyways anyway like it so
that's quite good that's my promise and
although I do think it'll be waiting on
so I try to find like really really high
heels and but no.9 your thighs but I
have to get oh no we've got a baby
nothing that I would normally wear no
quite a ways I mean they're not really
how I would normally say they are
absolutely so Moody
- so much better
[Laughter]
no they do they're a nice color I like
this bag me well 82 pounds
never send a damn it that 82 pounds at a
time not because five pounds this little
bracelet Scott keep looking i wings in
about nine different shops so while
looking around in Oxfam charity shop at
the way we found eight Western right now
you two colors look at these colors
everywhere like a bloody rainbow but a
little prom dresses
but I'm gonna get one you was gonna
bethe number one I'm gonna get there
found some well no stresses but I don't
know what prom is and what I haven't
look at that that is the nuts look how
colorful days is it from I'm not sure
and 1/8 a bit out that way never get bag
and shoes
right just been a multiband got a dress
just in another charity shop over the
road called shelter gonna give that a go
now
[Laughter]
just came out charity shops got me
outfits and not why expected
but I think on there
now actually winning quite a few shops
as well they're equal Iowa energy went
in there all right so Oxfam oh actually
now it's like quickly dress thank you no
man she like that I wouldn't like
personally Tuesday but at the same time
I don't dislike it I wouldn't wear it
myself not it's not a prom dress is it
but it's what you my kid compare my
bleep up the accessories in the bag of
me when we go down shoes properly but
yours have been sprayed on you but the
thing is you paid that job right here
and they didn't have any other size in
there like a sign we started off with
the better ones and we're working our
way down at least our bikinis now - very
good I like the dress utterly Lucy I'm
bad no I actually quite like the final
window
this is not like you I mean this is all
that got to do it from this bag but
somewhat some nice little going they
wanted it so I love that I'll take this
one so I was left the only home of black
bag in the shop pretty quick frequent
fur and look we get few money another
plastic bag yeah I like the dress a dad
and I think it might fit me as well
which is good so do any ones with me and
you finally what my size right that's
something so right are you ready to try
on do it let's do it let's go yeah what
is better then all I thought they'd do
together but if you go to the races nice
the shoes shoes to make city people
zoom into happy here please and show us
how she's wearing yeah I'm not too close
all right
the shoes are Moody I like me for
everything yeah even even the black
pom-pom bag yeah is our nascent I see
this is what you call a prom outfit not
be a Chinaman was fake though it is a
prom outfit it's a massive audience
appeal I pulled up what there's a
necklace just finishes it off you called
out the doggy on stairs maybe I'm a
bracelet but I yeah what do you think
damn I think the dress is really good
The Milk Tray bag is and all that price
it's not very nice email it so I think
you get given a christening but actually
yours is a prom dress but Mike so
everyone at their worst the prom dresses
honestly I don't know any of them so I'm
factoring though because it was so tight
but you need it these have the tiniest
week but the biggest food yes
like honestly was so big up here that I
feel like it made me look even bigger
everywhere else so that was I don't know
if I dare I think I do prefer yours
overall though yeah when you go to that
when you look at the price of my dress
$7.99 274 pounds but my shoes about five
seventy five years old
