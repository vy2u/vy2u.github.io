backdrops at home but currently mum and
I are in Los Angeles yeah so if you can

it down below but for today's video we
are doing like very exciting aren't we
you wanted to do this the solo I have I
know but obviously we don't have a
Walmart in the UK so I've never been
able to do there so now out here I
thought what a great great great time to
do this video so mum and I decided to do
an outfit challenge as we know that you
all love these type of videos we are
doing a warm up version minutes oh yeah

technically 10 minutes it was like seven
minutes choose the clothes three minutes

our favorite ring on the challenge mum
and I are here at Pumbaa and we're so
excited so we haven't at you been on
Walmart trip yet as well
for a big sci-fi family so each other we
both have a timer we're gonna go in
separately and choose each other an
outfit kind of just like la-5 outs I
believe yeah okay um I have a lot of
options what they normally use I think
they're gonna have a lot of option one
of us way outside and then with swap
over yeah yeah okay right do it
it's do it burn loads of things that I
would like that these that were running
short stuff like these are so cute I
really like these but again like don't
forget my mom they're kind of a bit more
younger no offense to you mum Nakia but
okay this is kind of cool they have a
massive bag selection and they have a
massive shoe selection so the
accessories I thought this is gonna be
easy
they're like moving around I didn't
actually realize the time that I thought
so I've only waited four minutes of
filming and just like oh I completely
forgot about the time okay I actually
have less than six minutes to get a
whole outfit out I'm not doing very well
it's so hard to shop I'm so back same
time and do everything else and every
minute so it turns out I'm done had like
10 seconds expect whites will have my
physical spare time about to go off
so proud I got them so I'm actually
feeling quite good actually I'm really
proud doesn't a minute it was a
last-minute rush
we'll go fun mom just sitting come out
here I don't know where I'll hang on
here's a think I'll actually I think I
hang on
mom go now she's sitting by trash bin
you're right mom okay but I took ten
minutes to give up I all that song fight
cuz I thought it was ten minutes just
looking seven minutes seven minutes

Charlie you've just changed that
only been one minute I've been in hand
all I can find at the moment is pajamas
and night wear so I'm kind of king now
Lisa hung up and get my mover
summer drench that looks like it could
be quite cute I just have to go with
that so we didn't have time that will do
at the watermelon one yep
oh that one what's been the bag that's
it love love love these are coming in my
bag I literally feel like I'm doing
supermarket sweep I've been like four
minutes I reckon rushing to the till and
I've seen this I'm swapping my awful
dress out I'm doing it walking around
just throw everything at my trolley and
then run out but then I run out I
changed everything that I threw it
reminds you hide it anyways it's not
like I'm gonna look for it I got two
bags full I wouldn't normally have
chosen a lot of this job I had more time
schemes I was saying he says you know I
don't know why I got the bag by god I
did anyway I'm gonna solve with oh the
t-shirt okay it's actually quite cute I
actually quite like this t-shirt is it
it's like that oh what's that great hey
boy
so like a man there's nothing and then
it's got this little band ooh that's
kinda my god there well so you know it's
okay right oh jeez so please well it's
better than what I picked up in the
first place doofus Offshore's apparently
nurse my weights you see that sure there
are two quite cute I don't know I always
have this thing about buttons I don't
know mine I created buttons on shorts
but they are kind of cute I like that no
attender buzzer there is six ten dollars
and the wall okay yeah how much of end
okay oh that's pretty good I love these
shoes
go ahead I just saw them running on back
to the tail look at that
I like them they're gonna fit me at
those what are these jelly shoes at yeah
popular bitch anyway no they're
cool yeah they're really cute so no
things are gonna fit I don't know I
don't remember the size difference I
think I'm dying here oh okay okay
I don't know they're gonna come in at
your house at me no I mean I saw they
look so unhealthy don't they these look
like that be like Jenny but they're rock
solid
yeah these feel confident yeah I don't
then Oh be the real the rape and the
collide are really not mija and a
massive floppy half a coil but I do
actually really like this but I'm not
sure that it goes with the outfit yeah
it definitely doesn't go at the top I
might need a floppy hat when I sit
around the pool got my hair in a bun so
when I put this on I'm gonna next stop
it so yeah I did see that in Primark
though for like really cheap yeah how
much was it
it was everyone guess in the comments
how much you think this is gonna be it
was $9 night and be quiet no isn't it's
not a lot I mean it's not because
prymaat do it yeah it seems like nothing
how does not hang on hang on hang on
hold up how does that go with any
wearing that way around you ready it's
Mike I'm gonna go got my stuff now I
have two bags as well and I'll tell you
all and I will clean every okay
yeah excuse me right you ready
so should we stop off with her or she
start with clothes okay I believe we can
go back so I got her a floppy hat and I
thought this one was so pleased by why
it's quite basic you always want a
floppy hat though this was also it
doesn't even say how much it was but
it's so cute look I think my size no
that is actually nicer because it goes
with your outfit anyway exactly right so
no no no mine goes together but the back
look how cute the bag is so nice it goes
with that it's white and brown
you've got the brown out no matter no
it's that became Blacky Brown that's
Bucky Brown but it goes together see
that you always wanna like be back I can
see this was so you it was harder with
mom because she's not very into colors
she likes more kind of cooler chic so I
knew this was for her so that's why
winning and I also got some earrings
these ones here and I thought they are
so cute is something you normally wear
guys so some of you know yes it is from
you always wear that change no you wear
shape like that and I would wear no way
I know
oh these are so nice we have the rose
gold is still by the number yes exactly
and you know what because you just got
black and white so far it's gonna look
great but you wait until the late I
thought I would just keep it simple with
yeah so I decided to check me a chance
no thank you even a jumpsuit would I be
in his love alrighty
she gave me a big floppy jacket has got
a floppy hat I'm not been known in skin
[Laughter]
right so I got you this stuff and see
I'm gonna show excuse me
all right so like it's a snow day
whenever you're medium so it's the size
8 to 10 so look basically it's a red
jumpsuit it's really really really nice
it's like flared at the bottoms it's
such a nice materials and you can adjust
the straps
you've got the fit on the front learn
it's off the shoulder which makes it a
bit more dressy but you can also have it
quite casual in the day I thought this
would be great for the beach and
honestly I look amazing then ya know
he's so nice and it goes this is where
you mother same colors as the earrings
are you seeing this are you witnessing
this amazing is so nice you look amazing
I got you these sandal but I thought for
Q&amp;amp;A don't you wanna know dude I got
these denim because denim goes with
pretty much everything they're brown
soles to go with the black cube wrong
we've got here and the best part is I
got her size so I feel great actually no
I got my size I feel like I got such a
good job are you ready to try this on no
I cannot wait I cannot like I get up I
ain't gonna do it you're anyway yeah
that's good
[Laughter]
look in ene I just looked in the mirror
[Laughter]
this is the outfit but you chose to make
this okay but this is not flattering
wait it's no why do you think is really
nice going to no.12 your bum looks good
day mom and the bag no the bag - the bag
looks really nice the hat looks cute
it'll be ok if it was cut it just needs
to be a bit bigger
is it nice and comfy though it's a high
risk you don't deny it but he's just
because if you had your head I'm a
beachy way with this necklace no no no
it looks so pretty I would wear this
bitch like a new what if your hair was
down
yeah sure looking up to get in the
corner
it's not bad bad I'll tell you what it
is it's the Hat there we go this is what
we are talking about
it's that do you know what it is it's
the Hat it's a little hair and fun
honestly both our hair down it
looks so in bed and that's why I think
I'm winning that how does go to the
outfit
what would you think this just doesn't
go because it went with the pink dress
that I had originally and I didn't have
time to change it Wow can we just to
move the bag and take a moment to look
at the shorts that I think they're so
they're so soft aren't they they're so
soft that ruined their t-shirt it's
actually quite nice shorts a cut-off
flight they're the shoes can we just had
a little money shot makes you better
than I thought the shoes are Q but I
just don't think that my guys together
mine's better I do I do I mean I
wouldn't wear with this together make I
was whether things separately maybe like
the water in a bag well they're a
semantic work separately
my outfits better choice is evening look
someone else mouth it's better than no
someone else who know the Queen Mother
it's just a loan it's just no I think if
you had your hair done I think I was
going you're from Yannick is nicer than
mine you're not worried
