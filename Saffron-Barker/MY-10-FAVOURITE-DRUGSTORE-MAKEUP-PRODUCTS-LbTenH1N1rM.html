channel so I hope you guys are having an
awesome day so far and I hope the rest
of the week you guys have an amazing
week today I'm actually in such a good
mood honestly I'm filming this video so
late at night
it's half past 11 right now and I'm
throwing this just because I felt like
filming I was like you know what I'm
gonna film right now I feel so happy and
all I want to do is film because I am so
close to 500k on this channel
can we just does half a million that is
insane I can't even believe the love and
the support I've been getting on this
channel recently not even just on this
channel or my daily vlogging channel as
well like it's absolutely crazy so today
if you guys have been following my vlog
channel you will know I have been
wanting to film this video for such a
long time and this is my top 10
drugstore favorites recently I've really
been trying to like reach out with my
makeup really trying to very not just
stick to like one brand and I went to
super drug and Boots and those other
different drugstores and I found so many
things I've literally fallen in love
with I'm gonna let you guys know my top
10 favorite drugstore product and by the
way they are in no particular order at
all there's one thing that I would say
is my favorite thing of all time because
it's my favorite makeup product of all
time but nothing's in any a particular
order so yeah let's get into this video
so the first thing that I do want to
talk about which I said was my favorite
makeup product of all time like this I
could never ever ever live about I don't
know what I would do if they didn't sell
this anymore
honestly if they stopped selling it I
think my heart would literally shatter
I'm wearing this right now I think I
kind of go overboard with a highlight
because I love it too much and this is
the Mary Lou the balm highlighter this I
think a lot of people argue is it
drugstore is it not it is actually
drugstore it's definitely the higher end
of drugstore but it's so worth it even
if it wasn't drugstore like I would get
it over any highlighter I have ever
tried before I mean it's absolutely nuts
I've never in my life
found a highlighter like this I never
ever reach out to another highlighter I
don't even want to try another
highlighter because this is amazing it's
just so pigmented it just gives you that
glow at the
personally it makes my cheekbones stand
out more when I wear this my cheekbones
are so much more defined which I
absolutely love it makes you stand out
the only problem with this I'd say is
you get it you fall in love with it and
you wear far too much of it because it's
so addictive and it's just like I'm
glowing home so yeah I'm wearing it
right now I wear it absolutely every
single day and I believe it 17 pound 50
but I'm gonna link it down below I
normally get it from Amazon because I
get Amazon Prime and then it comes next
day and I always make sure I have more
than one so the second it runs out it's
here you know so the second thing I've
got to talk about is the collection
lasting perfection concealer honestly I
haven't had this for long um to be
honest I've only had this for about a
week now because my friend Anastasia on
YouTube she told me about it I tried has
and I was like oh my goodness why not
try this before and I've seen this
everywhere over YouTube I've seen so
many people rave about it so I'm so
happy to have my hands on my own I'm not
sure how much it was I think it was like
5 pounds really affordable really not
too much the reason I love this
concealer is because it's not too thick
on your face I hate concealers that I
like you know clumpy and just thick and
it's like really hard to blend this
blends beautifully and also it lasts
well and I actually get the lightest
shade I get like fair one and it's just
such a gorgeous shade I hate like pinky
tone concealers this is completely the
opposite and also it's amazing not I
just only cover in spots I normally use
this to highlight my skin with as well
and also to like contour with and just
put on the lighter shades of my face so
this is absolutely great I love it and
it's amazing at covering spots as well
and very affordable so that is the
second thing and my third thing here it
goes Maybelline cat eye volume express
mascara this mascara I've actually been
using for four years I mean when I first
started wear eye makeup in high school
this is what I first went to and I have
tried many other mascara sins but this
one I think is just the best because
it's so affordable I love so many
high-end mascaras but this last for ages
and it does the job what can I say the
reason I actually love
it's because of the way the brush is
angled because it's kind of like angled
that cut eye shape it's so easy just to
get to good thing with this as well is
going the under eye smallest I have four
like I'm demonstrating it to you it's so
easy to do the under eyes mascara as
well because I actually hated wear a
mascara on my bottom eyelashes and then
I try to get this mascara and it just
really bought for me because it wasn't
like too clumpy and too much so I
definitely recommend this especially
we're just trying out makeup like the
first time it's definitely one to go to
and again it's not too much I think it's
like 549 and they always have deals on
with these mascaras as well but yeah if
you're going to get this make sure you
get this is that one because there's one
that looks so similar but it's not the
same it doesn't have this angle brush
this angle brush I love again another
thing I've been raving about since I
first started wear a makeup is the
bourgeois Paris one thing powder I
actually stopped wearing this like a
couple of months and then about three
months ago I got it again and I was like
why did I stop using this this is
amazing so I absolutely love this
bronzer the reason I love this bronzer
is just because it gives so much warmth
to my skin it's such like a natural
bronze wiser screen off that's annoying
we just cut that go it's just such a
nice bronze I'm also another positive
thing about this it smells amazing it
smells like chocolate I'm sure you've
heard that before it's the best smell in
the entire world oh and by the way this
doesn't run out I mean this will last
you forever literally forever moving on
so the next thing that I'm going to talk
about I've been wearing this not for
that long uh-huh I have gone through so
many different eyeliners I've never
actually bought like a high-end eyeliner
because I'm not good at doing eyeliner
the one thing the really disappoints in
my makeup I personally think is my
eyeliner I've never been good at it on
it's late and I've tried so hard and
I've gone through so many eyeliners and
this one is actually teaching me to be
able to do eyeliner and personally I
think my eyeliner looks so much better
ever since I bought this and this is the
color precise I lied
by Rimmel London the reason I love this
is because it's literally like a
felt-tip it's absolutely amazing there's
so many different foul tip eyeliners I
know but the good thing with this one is
very very jet lag
it doesn't like fade straight away
doesn't run out like all the other felt
tip liners I've tried before and also
the point is thinner than any other
eyeliner that I've tried before I mean
it's so thin and the end is so thick so
it's just so easy to do that winged
eyeliner and ever since I've got this
honestly I think my eyeliner has
improved so much every day it's
improving whilst using this and I don't
think I'm ever going to be able to use
another eyeliner than this just because
this is great and it's so easy
so again if you're just trying out
makeup if it's your first time where I
makeup again this is another thing that
I definitely recommend because it's just
so easy and so simple and it does the
job so notice I actually want to talk
about a brush this is my favorite brush
and this is I don't actually know who
it's by I think the brand might be just
called B because it has B on it but it
might just be super drugs own I'm not
entirely sure I've only ever bought it
from super drug and they have so many
different brushes of these but they're
quantal brush I think is amazing because
it's amazing just blending anything in
this brush is absolutely great it feels
amazing as well and it's so soft moving
on it to lipsticks so this lipstick is
by sleek and this is lip vips semi matte
lipstick I think this is one of the
newest ones I haven't had this for long
this is such a gorgeous pink color it's
like a light pink but it's not too
bright and not too subtle I love wearing
lipsticks
I love sanding out it just makes me feel
better about myself and I like to look
different so I didn't want a light pink
that was just too subtle and that you
could notice it but I really really have
been trying to find my thing and I came
across this one about two weeks ago and
this one I have absolutely love and I've
been wearing a lot recently if you guys
have been following my blogs and yes you
will know that it doesn't actually say
the color on it I think it I don't want
to say what I think it is because I
think I might be completely wrong but
and get a link it down below but it's
such a gorgeous pink if you're looking
for a nice pink this is one to go to
then of course I cannot miss this out
again this is actually by sleek I
personally think sleek win on the brow
game definitely again I have been
wearing this sleek eyebrow palette for
over two years now I absolutely love it
I wear every single day to fill my
eyebrows in and it is amazing I use the
shade light
8:17 again if you're just starting out
using makeup this is one to go to
because it's so easy it has mine is like
destroyed and the brushes are just in my
bag somewhere I actually use a different
brush because they're like tiny and I
haven't used these brushes in ages in
this eyebrow palette has a powder then
it also has a cream and I've kind of use
a bit of both I use a powder to fill in
my brows and then the cream I put in if
I want to make it thicker I use the
cream and as you can tell I definitely
need to get a new one yeah I've been
using this again for years just because
it's so easy and it matches my eyebrow
color amazingly I also can actually use
the darker shade of this I still think
it was but this is the shade for me this
is the shade I'm wearing right now and
again like 8:17 I think this is like 10
pounds no I don't know if I can talk
about this because it's not high-end and
I mean it's not really dogs so like you
can't get it from super dog or boots so
I was really undecided whether to put
this in the video but I just thought I'm
just gonna go for it anyway but this
actually is by Topshop but it's really
affordable it's eight pounds and it's
amazing and it's actually the lip color
that I'm wearing right now and I love
this lip color so much it's so autumnal
I have been looking for and lipstick for
so long there isn't too purpley but it's
very autumnal and this one I came across
about a month ago and I fell in love
with it yeah this is my Topshop and it's
eight pounds I such a gorgeous color and
I love how the lipstick is how it just
like twists is round I love the
packaging and I love the fact it's a lip
crayon because it's so easy to put on
your lips and the color is why does
nothing saying what it's cool of the
color is a wine gum is called wine gum
so the next thing I want to talk about
which again is by sleek and this is
actually their contour kit this is in
the shade medium I've never actually
using cream on my face before because
it's so thick on my face and I find it
so uncomfortable and I just really don't
like the feeling of it and plus it
doesn't really go nicely with the
foundation that I wear I just think it
goes all patch II and it's never a good
look on me I know sometimes it looks
amazing on other people and I wish you
did on my skin but it just doesn't and
I've never really liked using like cream
on my face that actually came across the
sleek cream contour kit and I fell in
love with it I mainly love it because I
love the lighter shades I use the
lighter shades more than a darker shades
this is a brand new one hence why it
literally looks brand new but I love
using the lighter shades on this to just
contour with and it's really good at
just making your skin glow and stand out
and it's amazing again so easy to blend
and it makes some really really nicely
with the foundation that I use I
definitely don't like the powder contour
kit it really doesn't work for me there
cream one I personally think is amazing
quickly before we do move on to the next
thing I just want to say I'm really
sorry that you keep seeing my ring light
in the background it's really annoying
but I had nowhere else to film and I
wanted to film here so I'm trying to
like cover it with my head but every
time I move like that it's not covered
so I'm really sorry about that the final
thing that I want to talk about is
actually eyelashes and I'm actually
really annoyed because I don't actually
have them in the box to show you because
I'm wearing them right now I'm a
seriously need to get some more but
these are the early and 1:58 eyelashes
by Kimberly these are the textured
eyelashes and they are amazing because
they are so soft and they just look Oh
Taylor look very natural as well I'm
wearing them right now I love them and I
would say do actually get complimented
about my eyelashes a lot so thanks guys
and I'm usually wearing these so to
everybody on my floors or even in these
videos my main channel videos that ask
what eyelashes I'm wearing they are
usually these these are always on
through / - so if you're gonna pick
these up make sure you get through for
two because I know you guys are gonna
absolutely love these so these are just
absolutely
oh good these are
absolutely grade so yeah get the 350 so
I believe that was actually my top 10
drugstore makeup products I haven't
actually counted them all so fingers
crossed this is my top 10 it might be my
top 9 on top 11 and because I didn't
really count them all I just grabbed out
like my my favorites I was like okay
