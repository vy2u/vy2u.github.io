you all or easy hairstyles now these are
like my go-to hairstyles I wear these
all the time they're so quick and easy
and the perfect for likes to score
especially as I up quite late for school
and have like 5 minutes to get ready so
they're really quick and easy I hope you
enjoy and let's get right into them so
as you can see my hair is already quite
wavy I did straighten it but it's kind
of gone like a bit wavy now and
basically I put it over to my side part
and now I've always have my how my side
margin I never have this middle part in
just because I prefer when you're doing
this hairstyle you bought into a hair
and a side part and which I've already
done so I'm just going to make it more
even a brush it's obviously in a side
part so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start off by grabbing all of my
hair brushing it through and grabbing it
really really tightly now the first
thing you need to do is separate your
hair evenly into two sections or as even
as you can and I think that should be
fine anyway to start off and grabbing
the outside of my first section my
transition I'm pulling it over to the
other side and you can see it dangling
here and then I'm going to do the same
thing with this sections on the outside
of this section I basically swap their
eyes you twisting them and pulling them
to each outside or the other sections
that make sense so that's what I'm going
to continue to do so I'm on the outside
here put part over then do the same this
side
basically I'm just going to continue the
pattern and just keep on passing them
over so as you can see you can really
start to see the plaque now and I'm
doing my really tired but you can loosen
it up at the end if you don't want it to
be really really dry and there you go so
that we just tie in my hair and so at
the moment you could tell that it's
really really tight at the moment I
don't personally think it's a good look
on myself so oh not me just loosen it up
especially it's the back here I just
loosen up the plat a little bit and
loosen it especially at the front and
maybe like you can pull some hair on all
these which is what I do I just put a
tiny bit of the fun out there and make
it a lot messier than it is so it's too
tight for myself
so there you go and then you should just
go over it some hairspray so I
personally think this looks like a quiet
cold chill Saturday look or Sunday look
or whatever day you're going before ah
yeah I just think this is a really
really cooler and it's something
different on a person I think it looks
so much nicer then animal back and then
I'll just throw some hairspray all over
it especially like down the plat so it
stays it and there's you look it's so
quick and easy and it's one that I love
the first thing I know to do is just the
brush back all of my hair now from doing
the other hairstyles I already have
hairspray in my hair just works quite
Nativa
if I didn't have hairspray in my hair I
would definitely stray hair spray on my
hair you put hair spray it in your hair
and then brush it through if you have
greasy hair I find a messy buns
definitely easier to do that way so I'm
going to start by grabbing a thick hair
band and just putting up my hair don't
want e to brush the back of it off and
it does have a lot of hair in it
currently and but then just metally put
up the front
it's messily even alone there's no sweat
you get let's make up
now I'm going to make sure it's really
high as well because if you have quite a
low bar and I find your entire
floor especially if it on camera a lot
like myself grab this hand and spin it
round and hopefully to go like a metal
bar and let's see then I'm going to grab
another thick hair band to push all the
matrices in place like that and then you
just need to bring out frogs it's quite
a lot in Nessie and go to grab some
bobby pins and put these in and start
from the back so it's pushing it up and
so the Frog comes out more like so so
this here is basically my messy bun
though because I said before is so easy
as you can tell I'm not a hairstylist as
well this is something that I like to
have a lot and especially at night times
when I'm in bed up as well and so this
is it it's so simple we need to do is
just spray some hairspray again also and
that is the end of the leg next
hairstyle is really really easy and now
this is one that I probably have every
other day I wear my hair like this so
much and you guys are always asking over
my social media and in the comments
below how I do my hair now as you can
tell already the top of my hair is
straight because I straightened it this
morning that's the first step of this
hairstyle you just need to straighten
your hair and they don't matter bit to
webby at the bottom as you will be
curling the bottom of your hair I've got
my curling Tong actually this is the
curling wand as I refer these something
that's so much easier I definitely
recommend these and these are just
amazing what I do is just grab a tiny
bit of my hair and just curl up like so
so you're probably going just under half
way of your hair length and then
should just be the bottom hold it for
say like five seconds or hoping under
the holder for the Kylie I'll pass me
better I think it looks like so so the
bottle I hands really clearly there and
I'm just going to continue to do that to
all of my hair so that's the no not I'm
on my back and use the bumper the combo
beat like jack-ay already know what your
chance not honestly there has to agree
about probably a minute and a half to do
that build my hair so not long at all
now the front center of my hair here
I've always do a less funny car there
this bit here and I've always do the
front section here last because I mean
it's really stupid which is have a
massive car going here so if you just do
it tiny team at that time and just do it
so it's a bit more wavy and a bit lower
down is what I do when I do this so like
so it has like a longer difficult and so
it goes into the coal and at the front I
just
Oh No shallow
Oh No so I think this is sought to
pretty dark and I have this a lot he's
just one of my favorite hair stars is so
easy and yet I just think it looks so
pretty and with the sec is why I always
wear like and pinky lipstick with it
because I just think good as a really
pretty hairstyle pink orange lipstick is
a pretty lips it to go with it so I'm
just gonna put some of that on and show
you guys what the whole like hair with a
lipstick color tonight so this is what
this hairstyle look languid like a pinky
orange lipstick as a lipstick I'm using
today which is one of my favorites is
sweet and sour by Mac which is amazing
and super bright as you can tell and now
the final thing to do this hairstyle
it's to put a lot of hairspray and when
I do this hairstyle I always make sure I
put a load of hairspray on or definitely
really really strong the hairspray as
it's one that I've dropped very easily
as little hairs been straightened so
make sure you whack a load of that on
your hair so you only when you need to
just spray the bottom as the top will
stay straight hopefully anyway oh and
those will look it's so pretty and I
love it and it's definitely one my
favorites
so yeah there you go okay so to follow
on with that dirt I'm just going to
brush my hair back and do hard on and
half down and I'm all going to brush it
out the tree marks because I want the
color to stay in but you can do this
hairstyle with straight hair or so but
personally I
curly hair I just think it looks
prettier I'm going to start off by just
grabbing a tiny bit of my hair like so
and I'm not going to run too much like a
load out I find if you have that much
like that you end up looking bored and I
only ask personally a good look so I'm
just grabbing a tiny bit although my
hair is really lucky because I just hold
it so to do this I'm grabbing a thin
hair band again just because I boys it
look too bulky when it's sitting on top
of your head and I'm going to try this
quite high art and very light as well
and so let's just do that oh no she'll
go you just put it quite tightly it
comes out kind of Engl bit of a
waterfall up go and took your head and
you don't want to look old and then I'm
just pulling out pieces of my hair I
want to tighten it so it's quite obvious
and it's how far down so I personally do
this look is really good if you don't
like having my hair completely off was
like I don't know I used to find I hated
having my hair up because I just got a
little too born it just fine it's
comfortable my hair down so I think this
is a great little cuz it looks so
different it's so easy
yeah once again is I'm rolling
prettier and you might want to like
recall this bit here but personally I
kind of like it wavy I think it's a
really good it's really really different
and yeah I love this lurk a lot so let
me just put my hair forward kind of put
this one up like so and that is the end
of this look I think this look as well
it's really good but if you want to go
from like daytime to nighttime and just
NIC completely different look it's so
easy to do like all you're doing is just
putting a hairband in your hair and from
what people would have saw you in a
daytime to evening looks so different
and once again I think it's so so pretty
and then finally like the other
hairstyles you should seek to spray
apply a little hairspray and I know we
don't three team up for this one and
just because I want it to be quite
wavier rather than really really thick
curls which is why I bought the project
through a lot as well and then you just
need to spray at the top here there you
go that is your complete half-up
half-down
so I really hope you guys enjoyed
looking at my go-to hairstyle as I said
before I wore my hair like this a lot as
you have said nose I think as you may
have said in like videos and over my
shows for me to out my blocks and stuff

all the time and is so easy as your
