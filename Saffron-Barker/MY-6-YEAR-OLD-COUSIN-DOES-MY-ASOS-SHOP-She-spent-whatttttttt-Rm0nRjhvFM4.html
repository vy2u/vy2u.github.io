that the duckies don't you you've got
good taste in fashion and said you know
oh love it which you hold it up there
and show everyone look that's so cute oh
you got such a good job yeah I have a
think so
it's a mini skirt yeah yeah but I
suppose the very
Ivy's actually done like such a good job
honestly I mean I wasn't doubting you
ivy but I thought I'd be a little bit
more colorful not so much killed you I
do have some cement I don't know about
its how I just said my virus the
weather's our way live with more tighter
at the bottom maybe thank you Robin a
little bit more what's the word not so
fitted I prefer the little bit more feet
in but I feel like you've done a really
good job I do still like it it's also
going normally get you've got to fill
out the accessory seven you IV I did a
little bit delicate okay I would they're
definitely not something I would
normally wear but they're cute you know
I feel like this would be so cute maybe
our mums do you think it's a little bit
more older rather than me I think you do
okay it's really similar to my little
gold moon necklace oh I love it but the
only thing is I be you put gold and
silver on the picture it said that was
Silfra okay never mind dude doesn't
matter that much does that is that shoes
you play out you forgot to tell Anya
all right I think there's more soft
oh no it isn't it's just that it all
bits and bobs that come with it I am so
excited to see what shoes you've got me
I'm not even gonna look until you put
them out okay
show the camera before you throw make
some solid sideways okay tell me when oh
nice I like I they are really not that
you've gone with black it's a nice safe
bet you know I like here was that have
my toes peeping I thought that I've got
the nicest times whatsoever I don't know
if I like these little bit side but then
I do really like the buckle the buck was
really nice you know I do think these
are gonna look really cool with the
leather jacket do you I think they look
so is that we use picturing yeah yeah
these with these shoes as they actually
look quite expensive and they look I
don't know how much they were I couldn't
even tell you because Ivy doesn't know
how much they were but they look really
right nothing but you would have had
your now so you should be sOooo much
expense
this is OB an invoice from here right
let's have a look forget so much cheese
then I think I'll get softer you get 34
pounds okay I reckon firework cuz you
can't see my dear I reckon around a
hundred pounds that's a lot of money
isn't it you okay you spent 282 pounds
can you believe that
thank you that may be thank you so much
I'm so excited to try it on yeah okay
let's go
what so this is the learning ok our
Ivy's go eyes is shot over there your
yogi yeah there's a lot going on y'all
ready for this okay you ready
what do you think I think so - that's my
favorite part
now as most I love the beanie I'm
thinking if I didn't have the beanie on
maybe they look a little bit less busy
yeah do you think love the shoes they're
so cool they kind of rise a little bit
older though maybe I know they're really
cool I don't really know if I was where
he's been they're really nice that I've
been oh really cool I just don't know
they other people earn advice for me
yeah you do yeah okay that's good then
you know I'm actually really really
really happy with it as I said I wasn't
too sure of the skirt it's turned out a
bit better than I thought it's a bit
tighter but I kind of wish this is a
little bit more pulled in Juneau I mean
a little bit more fitted yeah I think
that would be better
she's just agreeing with everything I
say but what if it were the earrings as
well yes go you know it no it doesn't
but it's okay so I'm rocking it aren't
we
let me just quickly show you the back
would you think behind I think it's
really nice G every jacket is really
similar to like this like a leather
jacket and I love the rib top as well
like this top half of it 100% wear
however it's going up a little bit of my
bottom IV yeah I know
oh yeah I'd rather shoot I think it
maybe is just a skirt skirting the
earrings in the Hat - sighs we can't
normally wear but I've gone up a comfort
zone and I just felt really proud my
little cousin for buying this for me
anyways so yeah we are back just tried
on the outfit honestly ivy I thought you
did an amazing job
I'm so proud of you are you glad yeah
boy you do a really good job what was
your favorite part the pom-pom hat was
so cute honestly so so you see this it
was your favorite I was thinking maybe
you could keep the pom-pom ha
[Laughter]
why do you want to i'm shuffle let me
see if you suit it first whether you try
on put it on
