welcome to my off to school routine they
should be starts around 3 p.m.
okay so first things first I head
straight to the kitchen for food and
drink I'm always so thirsty and so
hungry when I get back from school so
always have a glass of water
so what do I choose today today I chose
a nature bar and these I love so much a
lot of you know that they're so good
they're really healthy and it's just so
much yummier than picking an apple of
the fruit ball
okay he's so this is the part where I
struggle to open my naked bar oh well
done me so once a challenge is over I
learn well as you can cow my naked bar
and so then I would just watch some
videos from my subscription
now I'm going to head up to my room and
as you can see Bella is my biggest fan
and always want to view my videos
there's nothing better after a long day
of school than kicking off my shoes
chillin on my bed and just being able to
check up at all my social media and see
how all of these guys are doing in
between during that I do some revision
today done about 45 minutes worth of
revision although I do tend to have a
lot of rate as I do get very tired after
I have already been a school day
so at this time usually around five
o'clock I decide I need to get off my
bomb and do something after not be so
lazy and today I went to the gym Here I
am getting out some gym clothes I don't
go everyday I usually try and go every
other day
okay so this is the time why I have to
get myself really motivated and get
myself in the zone
so my bag is already packed so now it's
time for me to go go go oh and there I
am
or do you flexing my muscles get myself
in the zone already aren't I good
so today I met my friend and we already
ate at the gym so now it's time for
myself to run a nice relaxing bar here I
am choosing and getting all my
toiletries my shampoo conditioner and my
favorite body wash which is pumpkin
latte by Bob Body Works
it smells insane and to top it all off I
pick a lush bar for which all smell
amazing and I didn't really know what to
choose then I decided to go this new one
because it just smells so good
and of course I mustn't forget my
Facebook
the best thing about having a bath is
dropping my bath for men and just
watching the color explode it is so
pretty and it just makes a whole
bathroom are so gorgeous
and relax and then mate hello right so I
just have my ball and I'm feeling so
refreshed with I'm Ashley exhausted I
was in there for an hour and a bit I
just get one today and then I decided I
had to do to get all mouths of all gosh
my team and I now in my beautiful
monthly they asked me wrong I love you a
matching of
now is choice for myself to watch other
teaching videos check out all my social
media I do almost forget about ready
here and this was just like phase one so
emotional things also to mention of all
my makeup at my school I'm hot on there
