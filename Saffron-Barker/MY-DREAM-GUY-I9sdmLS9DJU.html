Harvey sup guys now say hello girls like
yourself go for it my tobe fucking a nun
for modern sick
that's literally no guys so means that
fun have been on tour for the last
couple of days yeah always taking loads
of Instagram pictures and snapchat and
they've been online and a lot of the
comment has been like are we shipped
YouTube all that kind of stuff so it
kind of has got this kind of like online
like same thing even though we're not so
we thought we should get some of you
guys some relationship advice and answer
some questions about relationships in
this half-drowned hangout will act buy
more ha I thought we you know the guys
don't specialize because I thought we'd
celebrate but we're not when you've got
all the paper like everyone you know al
we've got loads and loads of those
different questions so we've got we just
like chat about it and like how we feel
and like I don't know just difference
all questions about being in a
relationship and basically stuff like
that
because it's Valentine's Day how many
Valentines everyone that was really
clean doing it I really hope you guys
enjoy this video if you do peace much a
big like and if I don't know you just
basically enjoyed this video also
subscribe so close you guys have it
already and let's get into this video
it's that way shrim what question ever
one put it out go for it okay yes yes
girlfriend okay what's the buzz cada
birthday do you think the girl or boy
should pay or do you think they should
flip on a first day I think because it's
like the first time he's been see done
wrong but I could probably best to split
the bill but yeah being a gentleman I'm
not
saying this because I'm on camera I
would genuinely pay for the milk even if
the date didn't go anywhere after that
or we didn't feel like we connected I
still think that as a boy and as a man I
thought you guys as a girl and I just
think that art should be but also do
think that sometimes the girls will I
completely get that away from me
personally like I think it's more fair
to say split but if I'm being completely
honest I'm not expecting a boy to pay
for it is not like that I saw like if
like pages with few interests lifting or
as our three obviously fine with it but
for me to really think oh yeah really
like that boy yeah then they would know
how would you know idea like we have to
with would you go I would feel like
making really like me I'm sure when you
go out as well but sometimes you don't
just got to wait you guys into cinema
this is sometimes I might pay for the
milk yeah yeah yeah the cinema like you
kind of like share and that's the thing
even though I know so much so even
though I think like the boys should like
technically pain it kind of sounds wrong
you've gotta at least offer you like to
paint him like what to do but we went on
a date right and I just assumed she was
going to pay okay so if I do fail but if
I do thought the date went well and you
kind of just set them as like as expect
I can't like I hope it'll be like I
would spin a little bit like where do
you feel pain I'm still paid yeah yeah
yeah I would never want highly when you
get kind of guy I'm not kind of guy am I
wow I am that kind of guy that writes
that right really for like I'm gay right
here we go
how can you friendzone someone nicely oh
yeah I don't we began I think being on
it is the best thing for this job I
would rather be told to my face and just
either like being like bitch about
behind my back other people nothing and
not like yourself I find that so much
worse and she's getting told straight
out of the face but I think like people
handle it differently or via budget I
just feel like you shouldn't be let on
if you don't have them intentions then
don't like no don't try to take it down
that kind of room and if you've got a
friend zone someone like don't family
so don't be like you know what you're
like my sister friends on yeah that's me
I thought I like I generally think I
would feel so embarrassed
oh not even just heartbroken right
bearish sorry you won't want to tell you
what yeah that's what you like
imagine someone going you to know what
sucks you like my brother brother really
we're gonna go yeah we're good what
would your dream dates me I know mine I
know why were you go back I'd love to go
to New York on a day and go like walk
around at Christmastime in the snow and
have a lot the Christmas lights on I
think that'd be amazing
I've never been to New York Eva so to
take like a go around New York and go
shopping that'd be like a dream one and
then also to do like a day on the beach
in like the Moody have you seen like the
the hut in the beach in the water yeah I
don't that quite famous yeah enough to
spend like a day kind of like on the
beach in the water like go snorkeling
might look all the fishes I know I don't
have like a proper like it and like an
adventure date don't get me wrong I love
going to the cinema and like chillin but
I'm also like an adventurer I want to be
spontaneous want to go out on yeah I
love being spontaneous I like you hard
but I'd like you to my few date I've
generally said that since I've been like
what 10 years old I've stuck by this is
to go stargazing it's always gonna be
stargazing
there are like I found it winner yeah
like I generally think I was married in
school so some we get exhausted if
somebody has really bad breath you say
oh hey things with me is I am actually
quite honest person who wakes me right
now so straight out both denier and yet
he'd admit like just to help a friend
out like oh my goodness thank you so
much to telling me because otherwise the
world walked outside so you can depend
more other people who then would have
told other people and the news minute
everyone they not has got that right
behind my back yeah so for me like I
would love to look like be told and then
either questions the other way around
I would tell somebody depending on like
how well I knew the middle for this
first day and I was too
them I think our black magnetism oh okay
k9 guys first time I'm kissing them okay
they have that right I would be like I
thought I'd want to but I don't think I
could if I wanted to tell someone that
bad breath I kind of like him I do want
to join the oh my god yeah make you want
some yeah I'm gonna have to gun for that
anymore had already bad breath and I was
like oh you know cheering John do you
want one put a foot in my mouth didn't
want to hear gum no right but I might
make one wanna see take one what would
you say your type and honestly genuinely
made it and you think I'm going to be
really pretty saying this I doubt it as
long as you're going to class but I
genuinely mean it I don't have a type
I've never looked I've never looked at a
gala for wow you're my type
I looked a gallon for like I really like
you I've looked at a girl that's
completely different for every like two
so I don't think I found my type just
yet maybe I think if you look at
something out knowing them and seeing oh
my god they're my type
oh no me no no no look at someone to
think wow you're attractive yeah that's
not necessary you're my starting to like
spoke to them because some people can be
like company yeah you definitely got
time I even or greater Nolan so anyone
would like a proper good cure line again
online in fact cannot muscles and like
kind of beach dunes you don't mean like
root and skin like fit dark hair dark
blue eyes I like dark brown eyes or
Justin Bieber am i right did I try to
save that lead right don't get right
well what the hell i no idea right if
you kind of have that at the same time
that there's been people that are
completely opposite to that I still
found attractive well continue can you
give example receptor I don't know who
are giving knowledge of white oppositely
that way
I don't know right right okay have you
ever found your best friend or like one
of your really good friends attractive
you know what
definitely not best friend I found
friends attractive I'm yeah but like
your best friend I can look at the money
yeah I can look at my best to be honest
most my best friends are girls yeah
and how into boys not girls yes the most
of my best friends are boys but I had to
have a couple of really close friends
that girls but it's kind of got to the
stage but we are genuinely like brother
and sister so like we're in that zone
but we know that we've both grown
through like my web HMI that we just we
just know that we're just friends
yeah I've never been don't get me wrong
I've seen them like something a lot wow
you look beautiful today but like I've
never like been a like attracted to them
so the next question is how do you know
if someone likes you oh that's good
I know if a boy likes someone because
they were messing you backwards I'm like
straight away like people like unless
you're super super busy at work or doing
something it someone will find the time
view and live a boy genuinely like you
don't find the time for you like
whatever and then we'll never leave run
around if a boy leaves you want to read
and does I hate the whole like I was
busy
look I don't know if you Jen you have a
valid excuse that you was being your
letter you're filming right now on
YouTube video it's not like you do you
have a valid reason kind of thing but
other than that I know if a boy was in
sea like a girl because I would make yes
but personally and I wish I'll make it
laughs I would always try and make the
effort and I would always snapchat you
and I always want to FaceTime you as
well I think based on some problem
because yeah your face away and
especially but you're like I believe
don't leave I met people are
relationships but they don't like face
yeah I mean okay let's tell where I'm
like for me I like I FaceTime and at
least somebody every single day every
single day like for real that was good
advice thank but now I know where likes
me thank you okay so how do I not forget
likes me a girl I think I go tried to
hide it
Jamie I'm fun I thought I'll try neither
this is what secretly all girls know
like you'll be waiting there Santa
messaging back but you can't reply us in
that first two minutes place oh nothing
could such a thing
wow that's fine now I feel like it was
girl likes you okay and your babies are
over open as well about this for I'm
sorry
oh I finished drinks then next I knew
everyone
oh sure the camera your eyes Happy
Valentines guys oh ha ha ha ha fuck it
this fucking matter no fucking no I get
it
what do you find attractive in so
I could never date anybody who doesn't
or anything with their life like people
against like in the nicest way possible
people that generally like in bed from
like 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. like just
don't do anything with their life I
think is so attractive
like just for somebody to have a passion
in something and then you matter what it
is it literally be anything I do but the
have a compassionate caps of termination
yeah I think it's a attractive yeah I
thought then Martha kind of simmer but
I'm not really attracted to Talent
so I think I'm one can like a tote in
something could be anything like doesn't
have to be something amazing it is just
like a glass ami bacha Dan so or like a
can sing or like anything like that up
I'm really attractive in someone so that
