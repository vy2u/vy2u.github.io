requested video ever I haven't done this
earlier
it's took me quite a long time to build
up the courage to do this video because
I'm not one of the people that don't
wear makeup a lot I when they thought
every single day I don't go out the how
to out where I'm a convict I work
through the public come out wearing
makeup the only things I think I don't
know makeup is the gym but yeah I've had
to put up a little courage because I'm
really insecure about my skin and notice
as well I just love wear eye makeup
which is why I wear makeup a lot bit
hope you guys appreciate this video and
as it has took me a little code to do
this and I really hope you guys into it
so let's get into my face also I just
wanted to say this is no word of a lie
I don't know why I'm video in this video
right now because my skin is actually
one of the worst it has been in a very
very long time I've got those spots at
the moment and to be honest I don't
normally get you in spots but this week
my skin has been awful SoDo I don't even
know why what I do know is on this
because I'm going away next week so I
had to film this video today with my
really really bad but you know everyone
has fought so I'm just going to go over
it and I hope you guys enjoy my bare
face so here is my face so to start off
I get my bare minerals compact
foundation which I have been using for
years and use every single day and I
start by grab the Moreau techniques
powder brush and just by brushing my
foundation all the way around my face
always starting from my lips and then
the bottom of my face
now grab my really small but literally
favorite brush ever by Bare Minerals
once again and get my foundation and do
the same before without the bending I
get my brush once again started from the
bottom of my face and do this the whole
way around my face leaving my eyes and
nose last I use this brush I get more of
a darker color and therefore more
foundation comes out onto my skin what I
love about this foundation is it gives
you so much coverage but isn't too cakey
on the skin PS I get a lot darker skin
shade foundation as I find I'm a little
pale so more fat and look and I just
blend in my foundation and the shade I
use is RT 50 once again I've just got my
Real Techniques big powder brush and I'm
just rubbing around my face as I'm
blending in the foundation I just put on
with my tiny brush as obviously I would
be very orange impact gee if I'd
implement it all in
then I get my benefit for example which
I love so much as it gives so much
warmth to my face and they start by
blending apart on the hollow of my
cheeks and then my jawline area and this
I kind of changed the shape of the way I
hold the brush and I put it on the side
rather than the flat surface then I
literally just repeat exactly what I did
on the other side of the teeth obviously
as I want them to look identical there
we go and then I rub on the top of my
forehead so this is where I would
normally contour if I did contour but
this is what I do on my everyday look
then I've described my smaller
foundation brush and this is by an
auntie the link will be in the
description and I'm just rubbing all
over my face once again blending
blending blending here I've just got my
eyebrow brush and I'm just meeting up my
really pretty wild eyebrows as they
definitely need to tidy up before I suck
my sleek palette now this is my
absolutely favorite I do not know what
I'd do without this lead palette I
actually got my super drug but you can
get this on boots or super drug and this
has two brushes inside it has a square
brush and a round brush as you can tell
from the video I start by using my
square brush and then as they get to the
bottom my eyebrow I then use myself a
brush then I've just got a cheap
drugstore bronzer which i've got some
super drug and i blend this on my neck
and my jaw line so I can balance out the
color now depending on what mood Demming
I have two different colors that I
choose to use as my blush I have one
from Mac which is in the shade just a
wrap and this is a really bright light
pink and it has a little shimmer in it
as well which is so nice and I love to
wear this with like pink kind of
lipsticks and lipglosses so at the
moment I'm not going to wear a pink
lipgloss today so I haven't used this
one I've gone for my darker pink from
Mac and this is the colors desert rose
and this I've had for years as well I
love it so much it's such a dark pink
and and over the top of this I'm using
my shimmer from Topshop which is a
highlighter and it is the best thing
ever
I recommend it so so much it gives you
such a good cheekbone and basically I
just love wearing this it makes such a
difference to my makeup eyeshadow so The
Naked 2 palette now I haven't had this
for long to be honest but I am now using
it every single day I chose Naked 2
because it has such natural colors so
the color that I'm using is a Goldy
color and it's so so lovely and this is
half-baked I love it a lot as
what I'm just about to use in a minute
is a more of a pinky color and this is
in the shade copper to be honest I'm not
great at doing eyeshadow so I don't
really have a technique I kind of just
rub it over everywhere and just kind of
hope for the best
I actually use a Maybelline mascara
which I got from superdrug it's about
six pounds so not too much and I'm just
wiping it off obviously starting from
the bottom I'm actually making my
eyelashes as clumpy as I can at the
moment with this brush as it's a really
thick brush it's so easy to do and then
in a minute you will see that I use a
different mascara to spread my eyelashes
out
now this might sound strange and look
weird to some people but I grabbed my
eyebrow brush and I'm actually pointing
it down or upwards I'm not really sure
how it's been it I kind of go down then
upwards and this is just to make it as
thick as I can by doing this you're
getting as much mascara on your
eyelashes as possible so this is the
second mascara that I use which is also
from Maybelline and this is like a
thinner mascara so it really spreads on
my eyelashes as a at the moment is very
very clumpy and this gives me more of a
natural look now to finish off my
everyday look I get velvet teddy from
map which is such a natural color it's
quite dark sometimes I might use myth
over the top to lighten it a bit but
yeah I love this color it's so natural
and a lot of you guys know that I use
this a lot and it is my favorite and
there we go so that is my everyday
makeup look there's not really much else
today this is what I look like every
single day and now I'm just going to go
to the camera so you guys can see I hope
you guys enjoyed my everyday makeup
nothing why not really be for you you
might just lighten the products I use I
obviously love all the products I use as
I do use them every day I really hope
you guys enjoyed it especially as it is
my most requested video ever thank you
