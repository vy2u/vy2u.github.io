filming this video at the current time
12:00 p.m. that 12:00 a.m. is a
twelve-year always at 12 a.m. it's 12
a.m. it is 12 a.m. partly because the
video that I actually film for today I
lost a fetish ball which is so damn
annoying ah you know I have to go over
there so I'm filming at 12 around but
I'm actually pretty excited to do this
video because it makes me really happy
doing Q days because you guys get to
interact with this video so if you
follow my Instagram or snapchat or
Twitter then you can get involved with
videos like this if you don't follow my
social media the make sure you don't
miss out next slide it always be below
just want to point out before I start
this video my hand that's really
different today because I'm a middle
party and I haven't had a middle parting
in line in year I always have my hair
like over one side now let me know in
the comments below what you think of
this kind of hairstyle having it a bit
different one I don't know you guys
might not like it but I just thought why
don't you make different ones anyway I
think I'm gonna stop rambling on now so
it's getting to the video if you could
be any film character who would you be
and why I've got it I know that we won't
want to be I'd absolutely love to be
spider-man because it's my favorite
movie of all time I love it so so much
we in spider-man would have been
absolutely amazing just like swinging
from buildings and stuff it's
practically like flying so yeah I
definitely think I'd like to be
spider-man now we all know a lot of you
guys have asked what's the most
embarrassing thing you've ever done in
public as you can see just pop it over
the screen now so many of you guys asked
me two things that just popped into my
head straight away if I think I think
I've mentioned in a video before I went
to Center box and I was in this bar one
day there was quite a lot of people and
I was in like the outside jacuzzi pool
thing but there was like this rap okay
and I went to go walk down the ramp to
go into like the poor Jacuzzi thing yeah
next minute I had slid the whole way
down in my towel it was so embarrassing
I wanted to cry inside everybody
accepting
me and you know where you just see
everyone trying to hold in there laughs
yeah that happened I mean I think I'll
rather them of laughed at me because it
was just so embarrassing that was just
me sliding in the pool like you know sad
a new Tod M Zach the second thing I
would say actually happened two weeks
ago if you follow my channel you
already know this I was on the train the
other day and watch quite a while up
because they needed to go to the toilet
and somebody was in the first people
call so then I went in the second one
which is even further out got out the
toilet was on my phone other normally
I'm you know just walking down that on
the phone next minute I walked into the
glass door wow that was the end of it do
not to be with myself everybody laughed
and I mean everybody the train was out
to be packed
I thought maybe walk back no Jake
sitting over there what do i do what do
i do then I kind of stood there for 10
seconds thinking damn it what do I do
what road is this is too embarrassing so
embarrassing I had to walk down the
train with everybody laughing at me
staring at me and making no comments
like oh you have a nice little bump
there and I was like yeah
that's just not funny at all but that
was just you know you just embarrass me
evermore this one really makes me laugh
what's the funniest thing you've ever
experienced oh this time so strange but
I think this was the most I have ever
ever laughed I was in the pool with my
boyfriend Jake the other day and it
sounds really baby it's tickling each
other's feet and see how long we can
last and basically every time I tickle
with Jake's be here we get krump between
his baby toe and then like the toe next
rep does that you have a name is it if
that toe has a name let me know in the
comments below because I swear it
doesn't baby toe and the toe next to it
I Crump and it just notjust so weird
it was the funniest thing and like you
whenever we talked about it together
like I literally crack up in his there
is night it was so funny and I know it
sounds so weird if you guys ever saw
Jake's toe having crumbs is the funniest
thing you were ever experienced
brace up all this be in your video yes
yes it will if you was taking to a
desert island what three things
if I can choose people then the first
thing I think I would take with me will
be my camera because she knows film
videos might be a nice background on the
beach you know it's thinking ahead
always think of you guys but my laptop
for upload so now I'm gonna upload dude
just try and get 4G or something there
my phone so I can still contact people
and then I you know the hotspot for my
laptop or technical devices you know
what I mean that's what you're thinking
though you guys won't miss out on videos
are we having a great time where's
something you want to do by the end of
this year just think okay the most
amazing thing going skydiving I was
gonna go come on I hit a hundred km film
it but unfortunately I couldn't because
I wasn't 16 yet but I'm 16 in July so
hopefully then hopefully on my birthday
which is one - Thor I'm gonna go
skydiving and I think it would be the
most amazing experience absolutely love
this coaster favorite thing about ball
game I always say this I absolutely love
log in because it's the way that you
guys get to know myself better like
obviously I love the main channel videos
overseas so happy filming this right now
even though it's like very early in the
morning thing is with login is you guys
get to know me better and I get to
interact with you guys as well a lot
more agent work with you guys a lot more
than I do on this channel but I just
love vlogging so so much like yeah I
just completely get to be myself for
sure advice for somebody that wants to
start a YouTube channel there's a couple
of things I would say we starting a
YouTube channel one is to definitely
definitely definitely be yourself never
try and be another youtuber never try
and like do the things that they're
doing their videos completely be
yourself it's already a youtuber like
that so people won't want to watch the
same thing everybody's different and I
think it's amazing to show your
differences sighs they definitely be
yourself ii think do it because you want
to do it you know if you really want to
do that you shouldn't care what other
people think if you want to do it go
ahead and do it it doesn't matter what
camera equipment you have it doesn't
matter if you have size it doesn't
matter
everybody has to start somewhere so
don't think oh I don't have an amazing
camera so I can't do YouTube just start
do it because you want to do it be
yourself and yeah just go for it start
now don't wait don't don't wait what is
your favorite song
well I where's my favorite piece of
March so if you didn't know what I do I
do have my own merchandise oh you
haven't seen that then you can go down
but is Sakura ba da please cart out calm
my favorite piece of match would
definitely be the white soup up today I
just mean it's so cool with the gold
stuff and be here and it's like going
this I just think it's so cute and you
can get away with wearing anywhere I
mean I won't mind or the time was the
biggest argument you've ever had the
case in whose fault was there too good
is I don't really know what I'll be is
argument has been but if it ever has
been an argument is definitely cases for
like never lol all this case it trust me
