now for today's video I am doing my most
requested video of all time and today
I'm going to be doing my major
collection of 2017 it's the replaceable
silhouette this video has been rented
from day one since day one when I
started YouTube but I've been asked to
do a makeup collection and the reason I
haven't done one before is just because
I've always kind of been afraid not
afraid but like I am just so if those
three words to describe me it's
Messing's clumsy disorganized and I just
don't really have my life together so
when people came up with I call make a
pretty makeup collection by my main
question isn't like the typical like
YouTube amazing tidy organized thing
because I'm just not like that in
general like if you would require a
little bit in here right now because yes
from we know we know how messy you are
we know how disorganized you are and -
to plan as a person and today I thought
you know what I'm just a ghost Brett I'm
going to show you guys a major question
of 2017 now I do everything I have a
quite a fair bit
however in consideration to off other
youtubers you might not think I have
because I tend to give a lot of my
makeup away to family and friends and to
charity shop I try to give as much
makeup as I can away and I am so
grateful for all the makeup I have got
saying that I have got a lot of makeup
still like I definitely have multiple of
every single makeup item so I do hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you are
looking for some amazing saying it might
not be on this video it might be I don't
know but I hope you guys do enjoy smash
their big thumbs up as it is my most
requested video of all time and
subscribe satellite if you guys haven't
already and let's get to do what we are
going to take this video walks over
right now and I'm going to show you my
makeup story so basically the first set
of drol I'm going to be going from is
the classic
Alex IKEA drawers so this is a set of to
tour six a nine oh that's nine I thought
it's going to be even and it just wasn't
that was really disappointing anyways I
have a nine itself
Alex drawers here so there is a lot of
drawers to go
through this is this is what my main
storage draw like this is this kind of
like round a bit I'm going to go through
and I'm going to show you guys what's
inside so as I said this is the first
drawer so I'm going to go through it now
on top of quickly we do have my makeup
brushes these makeup brushes are so nice
I chickened out they are very clean I
literally love these these are so
beautiful they're from GWA and then
these pink ones here my friends got me
for my birthday I think from my brush it
difficult but they're pretty good as
well but these are like my ultimate fave
and I literally and love this part I
show you guys my room tour so if you
haven't seen ongoing link it down below
then equip me by the way I don't
actually like to UM pay but my friend
got me this
I like the congratulations of me here in
like 1 million so like it's just so
pretty and it is so cute so I always
have this on my cabinet ok they're going
to go on the top drawer now so I open it
this up and this is probably one of my
most random saw so I don't even really
know what to say about it these are just
pieces I have nowhere to put so as you
can see down here there are this is for
benefit yes these are some benefit i
shadow kits of these are actually really
cool I'm not going to open them up but
they already caught I really get a lot
of use out of them this is kind of why
they say in this drawer now these are
actually do use a lot and these are my
iconic highlighters honestly these are
absolutely amazing and I pretty much use
them everyday but again I have nowhere
to put them
so they're just in this random draw
however the second drawer and I'll juice
is actually one of my favorite drawers
and you're probably thinking why though
so basically part is actually one of my
favorite makeup brands over time
actually as you can tell I do love Urban
Decay as well so this is the
heart-shaped tape concealer honestly it
nothing will ever ever ever beat this it
is so worth the money it is very pricey
but so worth it and I can never run out
of this stuff now I'm so happy because
recently it did send me all of those
shades now I'm thinking because I'm not
these colors I might try and use these
other contour I don't know if any of you
guys have ever tried that if you have
let me know down in the comments because
I think it might work and I think it'd
be pretty good but I swear by these so
much they are honestly the most amazing
thing and hopefully I won't run out for
a very long time and then these here are
the Vice open Decay liquid lipstick
now these are really nice I haven't
really had a chance to use all of them
yeah I've used a couple of the Reds and
the Reds are really really really pretty
I think it's the throat that I love yes
this one here and this one is crimson I
think I've spoken about this one in my
blog so a couple of times but that's
such a gorgeous read but honestly I
haven't really tried all of the
lipsticks yet so I've still got a long
and sort of a long time to go through
all of them so that is the second drawer
now okay right so this is another
lipsticks trough now I have way too many
lipsticks these lipsticks are all by
Maybelline I'm going to see I swear by
these lipsticks as well they're very
very very new to me now these are the
vivid hot lipsticks now I literally love
this one here this one is in the shade
70 so hot and I was saying this on one
of my videos recently and I do I have
been wearing this read quite a lot ever
since I got it all the thread is co good
to this one it's more like an orangey
red and this is orange shot so honestly
their colors are just so nice in general
this nude one here is so pretty as well
this one here is called tease and I
think this is probably my favorite one
of the collection it's so so so nice
what I love about these as well is it's
going to sound kind of strange but I
love the brush I love how you apply it
to your lips it just feels so nice and
all oh my god I'm like missing it and
also it smells so good as well so here's
kind of like my Maybelline lipstick so
they're the liquid one I do love these
as well I haven't got more juice out of
these or have these they do you like to
wear crosses more but these are really
really really good as well this is one
color I want to show you there's a
really nice like very rope I just oh my
god I literally cannot seem to find it
yeah these are really good as well and
I'm just going to quickly show you what
they look like as you can see but you
might be thinking stuff when you have a
lot of greens but they aren't the color
inside the packaging that's the only
thing I don't like about these because I
go to pick out a lipstick and inspect it
to be the color of the packaging and
then I realized actually as you can see
it's nothing like of the color of the
packaging as I said this here is a very
random block of just their makeup so the
next drawer you're going to be like what
the hell out this is probably my most
random draw dishes makeup again I just
have nowhere to put now I do have makeup
that is imported Alverez
yeah this is really disorganized so I
have a lot of like brow products and
products I just haven't tried in general
a lot of products from a benefit in fact
I have tried this mascara I love it and
it's in my mascara drawer I will be
showing you that but yet it's actually
such a commence car I just yeah I've got
a spare one now so also this is my
favorite primer all the time and I will
speak about climate stuff once they get
to that drawer as I said this is just as
many products and products I haven't
tried these are actually supposed to be
so good are these the contour sticks
yeah yeah these are the quantities and
these are supposed to be so good so I
will give these a test and I will try
them on my second channel for you guys
as you can see you've got some random
litter as you can tell it's just
packaged up stuff then the next row is
one of my favorite drawers this is I
haven't actually got any organizers so
it's kind of a little bit everywhere so
I kind of apologize for that but it is
my favorites because I love looking
bronze and I love love love looking
glowy so this is the perfect draw for it
because this is my highlight and my
bronzing draw and it is it's like these
are all of my favorite products I love
this drawer so so much so obviously we
have some Too Faced bronzers over here
honestly this bronzer is so gorgeous
it's like so on is actually a new one
then as you can see is so pretty as well
it has a little bit of a blush and a
little bit of a gold shimmer as well I
am loving this one so so much so there's
my cheapest bronzers I love this one by
the bomb at the balm is also one of my
favorite brands
I literally swear by the hoola blonde so
you can never really go wrong and then
I've also got this Tarte bronzer which
is a little bit more subtle it's more
towards similar bronzer
however the hoola bronzer is like very
buildable so I don't know I think maybe
the hoola bronzer I don't know these are
all my favorites I love them all just as
much as each other it's already really
good as well by Rimmel is a little bit
cheaper
this is also really pretty this is kind
of in the middle like this is a
highlight but it's not let us see it's
cheeky bronze so it's a little bit like
a glowing kind of like shimmery bronze
and that's really pretty but my favorite
thing ever is this and this is by
Clinique and this is the chubby stick I
use this to contour my face a lot
because it's a very buildable you can
make it really subtle or you can just
really you know go before extreme guys
but that's so easy to use if you started
out on makeup
really good one that I recommend I'm
sure you guys would have definitely
heard me talk about there and this is
the Marylou highlighter by the balm this
is absolutely incredible the best
highlighter I've ever used and I
literally I swear by this like this is
my go-to actually in the back here I
have another one just so I like to never
allow this stuff because it will be so
sad today I do so always going to have a
backup for that and then I've got some
other highlighters so this is also one
of my favorite highlighters ever and
this is by its heart it is absolutely on
it real this is sparkler and it's more
like a dark highlight but literally it
works for any skin tone and then this
part one here is actually very very very
similar to the marryin again another
random draw so this drawing here is full
of so a mini face mouth full of nail
varnishes and hairspray so that's not
really anything to do makeup so let's
move on these are my lipsticks obviously
as you can tell that all the ones that
sit inside of this container and I don't
really have anywhere to put these so
these are want to see like a couple of
my favorites I have a lot of my favorite
matte liquid lipsticks in here so this
is actually my favorite of all time this
is a Viva Glam in the shade 3 and
honestly wait for it as you can see it's
been used but honestly this is such a
gorgeous like autumnal color I wear this
so much in like autumn time and just in
there like when Christmas comes out I
will be wearing this all the time it's
one of my favorite cards ever then we
have a couple of my other favorites as
well so this is sweet and sour which I
don't actually think they do it Mac
anymore but it's like a beautiful like
orange pink color and that is so nice
and as I said these are just kind of
like my favorite lipsticks all times
then in this drawer here is just some
like hair stuff so these are like if I
want to wear my hair up and I like you
know hair extensions and stuff not
really do a makeup and in the bottom
drawer here it's just full of like
makeup bags I can't even open because
that was so many major bugs inside and
this is the 9 set of Alex drawers now
we're going to go into my main makeup
storage moving on to the first makeup
drawer in here because this one up here
is on it you just like a messy jewelry
drawer but I need to get sorted out ok
so this is my main
lipsticks your honor in sight here we
have all of my favorite lipsticks now
this is really hard to organize because
I like a lot of different and different
brands and they're all like completely
different shapes but over here we have
more of my nudes so these are like my
ultimate favorites and they're both by
bare minerals and this one is in the
shade wink and then this one here is in
the shade cookie and honestly these
matte liquid lipstick oh no forget I
mean that your more creamy than that the
supposed to be map and they're more like
a creamy lip and they're really really
really good as I said from bareMinerals
and I was wearing this one at the start
of the video so if you like that it's
that but yeah this is more of my kind of
like neutral I also are where they're
going everywhere I also love this one by
new look as well and this is in the
shade new pink want to see if you can
grab your hands on this to do it because
absolutely stunning and very pigmented
as well this one by o fries oh my god
I'm such a mess then at this one by
Oprah is actually really nice as well
even though the shade of this but it is
Aries and I actually bought this it is
part of nikkietutorials collection but
it's such a pretty color as I said
there's just many like news and stuff in
here like new maps then in this drawer
here I put a lot of liners and stuff so
my favorite mine is all trying other
ones by Tarte because they're really
creamy and they don't break and also you
can like screw them up and down and it
Maps do some really good ones as well
however I calmly seem to find an e also
so I just say Primark lip liners are so
good so difference by Primark and it is
literally amazing I use this a lot of
the time so this right here is mainly
metallic and just my Kylie collection as
you can see I've got a lot of different
Kylie's inside of this store also inside
here are just some liquid lipsticks out
my all-time favorite so this one by
Laura Mercier is my favorite red I also
have a favorite red by Tarte as well by
which you cannot find it so it's
basically a crying because I can't
include it in this collection but this
one here is in the shade red brick and
honestly it's so nice the formula of
this is absolutely incredible and it
just are so amazing am I going to be
able to put this in a yes I am there's
one of your is actually just called mom
but it's such a gorgeous and autumnal
color and I literally love it it's a
little bit whiny but a little bit less
of a purple book so much
and a purple so it's a little bit more
ready in its eyes just such a beautiful
autumnal color and I can't wait for
winter now just so I can wear this bad
boy now in the back over here we've just
got some random kind of like glosses I
actually love this one by who is this by
again this is bicep and gory this is the
best mother Parker like lipstick I've
tried like if you want to lip plumping
gloss this is the one to go for because
I bought this one from Too Faced and
literally oh my goodness this one cost
me 22 flippin a pound I thought it was
going to be like really plumping like
feel amazing on my lips and honestly it
doesn't really do much so wouldn't
recommend that one even though I do
actually love to say yeah these are just
kind of like philosophies and just
random things then these ones back here
kind of like mini colors so I've got a
lot of like mini NYX lip sticks and just
me lipsticks in general so again a
little bit random but the reason is
destroy just random because they are my
favorites of all time
so everything in here I try and use as
much as I can so now we're really going
to get into it
this is like one of my main drawers here
so this one has a little bit of
everything so over on this side I've got
all of my concealers now I literally
love this concealer here as you can see
I've got these and these are the
collection lasting perfection concealer
already on the top I can see for but I
probably do actually have a lot more
they are three pounds three pounds i
droopy and they haunt honesty absolutely
in it credible they are so creamy the
formula is amazing such good coverage
and I've also got some talked shape tape
here so some more that has promotion I
haven't even opened yet now I got this
new lip concealer for a video and it's a
Crandall seal and I didn't think I'd
like it but this is honestly amazing as
well so I do use this however it's too
dark for me so I need to get a light one
and I definitely will get a lot more use
out of it then also I have some tips and
sub ones I haven't had yet to try then I
have the Maybelline eraser over here now
this is honestly amazing as well however
if I had to I had to choose between the
two I'll probably choose a collection
lasting perfection but this one is so
amazing because it's so easy to use and
like it's just it goes it goes quickly
what it does in there's a lot in there
but I use it so quickly because it feels
so nice on my skin and then I also have
some like la program concealers as well
which I do really like however I just
think they go so so so fast but for the
money they are really good and the
author I've got some cheese Faced Born
This Way concealer as well and I
probably do have some others but they're
all that I can see and there you go
there's more collection lots of
affection just hiding underneath there
oh yeah I have a green one as well which
is really good so it my skin's ever a
little bit red or perhaps you after a
spray tan then I will use this one here
because it's really really really good
and as I said three of power guys so by
the way this is not sponsored I just
love them and then it's like kind of
moving over to the middle so this here
is kind of a little bit of everything so
it has kind of got eyebrows eyeliners
that's not proper in eyebrows and
eyeliners oh and it's gone I pencil as
well so these are things I do actually
use every single day so my favorite
eyeliner of all time is a Kat Von D
eyeliner honestly it's not bad eyeliner
I get this because I'm telling you now
this is what taught me to do eyeliner
because I was awful then ever since I
had this I could do eyeliner I'll
actually swear down to this it's like a
pen but it's the best pen because it
doesn't dry and it's just it's so good
at it's like jet black but I also love
this one by Rimmel which is really good
but you kind of have to know how you
kind of have to be able to do eyeliner
because the brush is very fine but it is
a really really really good eyeliner and
very affordable
oh my god you've had a cop in my throat
is here is the goof proof brow pencil by
benefit and I use this nearly every
single day now because it's so easy it
has a brush on one side and then it has
like a little pen on the other side and
then we've just got some eyebrow powder
and we have a few of stuff that on a
theatre when you use that much and then
as you can see this little bit here is
my mascara drop as you can see I've got
a lot of different mascaras now this one
I've been using a lot recently and this
by Mac I literally love the packaging
but if everything about it is the fact
that it has like a little tiny brush on
the end so you can do your bottom lashes
but then as well as it has like a tiny
brush it has a big brush for the top
eyelashes so
really easy and handy to use and oh my
god is mr. but if you get your mascara
everywhere the nipples gray is quite
pricey though but it probably I would
say it's worth it because really easy to
use and it comes out very jet black my
favorite mascara of all time oh is this
one by Maybelline you would have heard
me talk like this a lot is the cat eye
mascara and it is so good I mean this
one is so run out now like lychee I've
had this one for the longest time so I
do actually have a brand new one over
here but I just like scared to even
start though but it's amazing it's drug
so it's about five pounds and probably
it's just as good as anyone in here
however one of my favorites of all time
is the Too Faced better than sex mascara
this is only a mini one but I do have
like a big one in my makeup bag and it
is so nice literally I use this one
probably more than any one I use in the
drawer and it's weird because I used to
hate this but actually now I literally
square by there I also have some tart
ones as well that are really good and I
really like those and oh I love this one
too and this is by Maybelline as well
overall though I think Mabley into the
best mascaras for money yeah there's my
little mascara section and then we're
moving up here so you could so annoying
I hate the fact you can't open these
drawers enough but in here I have like
blushes and stuff this is like my
favorite blushes and this is by a
benefit and I see California blush is so
so so pretty I also love the fact that
it has a mirror as well honey yeah this
is such a pretty kind of like coral
beachy pink definitely gives me the vibe
of summer I also love the packaging that
I want to have one by the balm it is
really pretty as well I love this is
very shimmery and then I also this is so
and so nice so this is by Tarte this is
more of a subtle pink but it's such a
pretty pink and I do use this a lot this
is the probably the longest blush I've
ever had I've had this since I first
said wear a makeup because my mom gave
it to me and this is so pretty by Mac
and the scene is in the shade Desert
Rose I can't remember it's kind of like
rubbed off but I'm pretty sure it is
quite dark pink but it's so nice I just
took what this point actually I take
that back this one it does actually go
back quite a lot we just can't see this
1x2 face is so good as well I love this
as you can see I've used this one a hell
of a lot the next row is kind of like my
main draw because this is my foundation
draw so this is all the foundations I
own obviously own a lot of these parts
stick foundations that are really really
really good but I did get then every
shade so that's why I have a lot of
these and how about you've given a lot
of way as well I still have so many left
I'm going to go through my foundations
so this one here is my favorite
foundation I've ever tried it honestly I
can't say a bad word about this
foundation honestly it's so good for
your skin as well and literally don't
even talk to me about this very notion
because I can't fault it in any way if
you're looking for any foundation this
is definitely one to reach out to and
all my friends now use this one book
company and they literally love it so
much
the information is really good as well
this is Firebird and this is the
all-nighter foundation and this does
actually last a really long time now
this is quite dark for me so I don't get
too much use out of it unless I have a
spray tan which I do right now and then
we also have this one here I don't
really use that much I do like it for
coverage wise but it doesn't really fit
my well on my skin I do that mixin it of
Londoners this is the older HD stick by
Makeup Forever and obviously everyone
raves about this but I'm not a massive
fan of it probably should move on that's
kind of like my foundations and then
obviously here is like my primers and
illuminators so my favorite primer of
all time is the Porefessional by benefit
I swear by this stuff and I try to use
it every day but it does go quite
quickly but honestly this stuff is
amazing is I mean it's not really
expensive in consideration but like it
does the job so it's so worth it another
thing that I love I've lost the lid for
so I'm very sad by Mac is the strobe
cream because this lidium makes my skin
look so glowy and I use it as a primer
so if I do use this I won't put a primer
underneath like I use this as the primer
and I don't put it on top of my makeup
only underneath so as you can see I've
got another another professional as I
love it so much this one by hourglass
actually really good I got a scent about
two months ago and it's lasted me such a
long time I really like this as well
however it doesn't make my makeup last
that long but it does literally am a dry
skin so so good I love
these primers as well as you can see
these have had a lot of use of them
they're like so annoying then I bought
my present Prime Spray I've got two here
because I kind of get out but these are
my favorite things ever I love these I
also have a really good one bite hot and
I don't know where to put it now but I
love that second spray this is literally
I swear by this again this is so
ridiculously expensive like ridiculously
but it lasts you the longest time
because it's so big and mine's kind of
everywhere right now but this
translucent powder is in literally
everything that I don't really bother to
pry them off this one by its heart is
another powder that I have but I haven't
really used this and I don't think I
like it because like more of a whiter
shade where this one's more neutral and
you can't see it so everyone I thought
through that quite a lot but that is
that dry then we going on to my
favourite drawer of all time and this is
my eyelash drawer I literally I love
wearing false eyelashes so much so this
drawer means everything to me so I'm
going to quickly go through there these
lashes are by GWA so these purple ones
here at the back they're only three
pounds which i think is really good
because you can definitely wear them
more than one and you can get them from
my Primark but you can get one Primark
and then I think you can get it from
that online store but they are so nice
but my favorite out of these ones these
ones are a little bit more expensive
from the same brand ah if this one my
love I can't remember yeah it must be I
love a mythical they are so like pretty
and like softly and just such a
beautiful eyelash and again I use them
multiple times
and then my favorite acid oral timer
nothing will compare to these but they
are so expensive I think that like sixty
and pound of hair but these are by Hyuna
Beauty these are the most incredible
lashes I just love how they sit on me
honestly and these are these Sascha
lashes so I have three different pair of
these I also have a pair of lashes from
backstage here is just a tweezer I
haven't opened yet I do need to it's all
put in here isn't literally a confident
I can get it out now but these are
lashes that like I've reused so I put
them back in here so don't lose them
then we put eyelash glue I swear by duo
there is no eyelash glue that whatever
as ever big duo and I've got like a lot
of I mean I've only got two in here now
but I
I think all the duo's so they're a
little bit different to each other but
they are both amazing and slowed by our
straw the other black I've just got like
space wipe so as you can see I have more
IKEA drawl so these are the drawers that
I just went through over here and then
now we're going onto these ones so this
is kind of a mess this is my sunglasses
drawer and then here are some pallets
inside here so this is a violent box
color oh my goodness the colors are
absolutely stunning I was very very news
they don't a very use but I love all of
these I love the shade teddy bear wine
and dine I love hash tag I just think
like these are all the colors that I use
on my eyes I'm not very adventurous but
I do love more ready toned and orange
tones as well as the kind of like warm
brown toned and obviously it has all the
like nice subtle colors as well so if
you're looking for an eyeshadow palette
that has a bit of everything this is
definitely one to go for and it's just
so so so nice and by the way I got this
from Beauty Bay which is an online
website would they do so many amazing
things and things that you can't really
get hold of in the UK in fact most of my
makeup I get from beauty day I got send
this from naked a couple of weeks back I
think I showed you on my blog but this
is the naked heat palette and this is so
nice I haven't actually had opportunity
to try this yet so this is another thing
this is the emission from inks palette
by Mac and I've been working with them
on this palette and it literally is
incredible as you can see my favorites
are the oranges and as I said like I
love the pinks as well as he kind of
like brownie warm tones so that's kind
of surprised that this palette gives off
so when they asked me to work with them
on this pie I was like yes yes yes yes
and plus how to is the packaging for
this I also loved this one by Mac as
well this is my favorite Mac palette so
we're going to go onto this drawer so
this one again a little bit mercy and
this is the palette drawer but no eye
palette so this is kind of my contour
stuff so I have two kkw
contour stick and I haven't even had
chance to try them yet I'm very excited
one so excited to try that actually this
is a sleek contour palette which
honestly I swore by this for the longest
time I mean I don't even know why don't
use anymore ah it is already such a good
cream contour
and it's such a good jus to the
Anastacio cream contour palette I
actually think it is so much better and
it's so much cheaper what was I thinking
leaving this the last this is my
favorite contour palette ever no quantal
pilot will ever beat this like literally
I'm not even exaggerating when I say in
this like yeah fair enough like all of
those good but this is literally like
something else like you will look like a
different person if you buy this like
this yellow banana shade as well like
that is amazing under your eyes and
these literally give you the best
cheekbones like I got so many
compliments when I was wearing this but
because I got like quite a dark because
I was using quite the dark shades when I
didn't have a like a tan I stopped kind
of using it like as summer kind of ended
so I need to start using this again
because this is the best palette I have
ever used genuinely you need to get your
hands on it is unbelievable and then if
there are these final drawer guys how do
you feel so I have the mo terminator
palette which is actually my favorite
eyeshadow palette am I going to be able
to open it yes your girl is this is my
favorite eyeshadow palette and as you
can tell it's disgustingly messy but
