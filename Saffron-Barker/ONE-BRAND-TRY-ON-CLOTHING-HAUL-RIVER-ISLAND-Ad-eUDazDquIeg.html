hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel now as you guys can tell my
voice I am currently not well as I'm
sewing there which may see fast you want
to say I'm really sorry there wasn't a
Sunday upload recently is the first
Sunday I've missed in 682 days that I've
been doing YouTube today as I'm filming
this I've never listened I upload into
last week and in leech who breaks my
heart I hated it so so much so I haven't
actually been able to make it out of bed
like I haven't even been able to do my
vlogging and you guys know that I try
and vlog every single day and that
didn't work out either because I've just
been so so sick but I'm back and I saw
if I'm gonna if I'm going to come back
and I'm going to do another video why do
I do want that I absolutely slip in
laughs so that's going to be a river
island whole because river island a lot
of you guys know it's like one of my
favorite shops as I had also I just love
shopping in general so why not come back
with a whole service all we had to jump
into the video the top that I'm wearing
right now is of course from River Island
and each was certain pounds it's really
really cute it's like a lace kind of
like frilly at the top and it's off the
shoulder which I love because because
they're a little bit more dressy and
then also it's like a crop tops as well
but it's like elasticated so it's really
comfy but I hope you guys enjoyed the
video and let's get into it
is pretty much all for summer because
everything I kind of got with like some
are related as summer is here so the
first thing oh my god is doing style at
myself and I hate it so the first things
I'm going to talk about are these shoes
which I am so obsessed with they are so
- um I'll it you cannot wait to wear
them so these are these kind of light
beige I don't really know what's called
an esper to be kind of like actual
looking but they're more like deck shoes
however they kind of have that height
which when you're small like me is
absolutely perfect can you need a little
bit of height in your life so everything
I don't know I just I really really like
the height of them and also that's so
easy as well like I love different shoes
because you didn't have to tie up places
and if I don't know if you just get
going to the beach you're just coming
out the water they're just easy to slip
on and off and also as well they're
great the evening because they're kind
of like dressy but you can dress them up
or dress
down so those things are basically a
must and these were 24 pounds
I honestly think you guys are going to
love this one so much especially if you
have like festivals and stuff coming up
this year this is this kind of like
denim bum bag now I love a bum bag at
festival I thought was not better than a
denim on denim is so in at the moment
since like I saw this I was like oh yeah
oh yeah like that is me and I don't
think I've ever seen a denim bump out
before so why don't grab myself watch so
this I am in love with I think it was
around like 14 or 12 pounds so really
essential pricy and it will definitely
get used a lot and it's kind of like
that getting kind of like patchwork so I
love oh and another thing that I love
about it as well is the fact that it has
two pockets because a lot of bone bags
boom bag from bags a lot of bum bags
only have one where I just wanted to
yeah I love the topic of a denim I also
got this really cool like denim sky kit
looks kind of like vintage to me only is
it done in but it also has that kind of
like tied a look which I love you know
kind of small on the site so I've got a
size pen and I kind of wish I got a size
down a little bit too big so that is
what I'm going to do but overall I love
it and I love the fact it has pockets in
the back as well I display it was really
really cool and again it's one of those
things we can dress up or dress down and
this always is always going to look or
it's always going to look good MA shoes
because you guys know my addiction so I
am Pete Ravi shoes and I'm already sure
what to call them or describe them as
well they kind of like they've got this
peep toe they're also backless at the
back and then it has like two different
straps with kind of like the cowboy
buckle which I think three really cool
have like vowels that are similar so I
thought it was yes oh it was cool and I
actually don't own anything like this in
my wardrobe so when I saw them I
literally straightaway fell in love with
these now I just thought again there'd
be great for things like festivals and
stuff and also is one of those things
that you can put on line with a pair of
denim shorts and if you want to look a
little bit more than casual but you know
you don't want to overdo it then
something like these shoes would be
amazing because it kind of make you look
cooler with smarter so cool
yeah I love these as well I felt like
you guys going to be shocked to be like
saffron this is not you and this is not
something I would normally buy but I do
notice a second I'm sorry I was like oh
my kid is like I is so so pretty so
basically it this long skirt now is
closed like it's not really lays it's
kind of like secret like flowers I just
labor so pretty so that's located at the
front and it goes all the way down to my
feet however it's shorter at the front
and then it's longer at the back I
noticed so it was so so pretty and it's
one of those things that again I can
wear with Eva sandals or I can also see
myself wearing it with heels or like a
nice little crop top if I'm going out so
yeah I just thought it could be really
dressy and also really cash I decided so
so pretty I thought I would like to
venture out of the comfort zone and get
something out now more shoes because you
guys have asked me where these are from
oh my goodness I think more than I've
ever been asked where anything is for in
my entire lifetime these are these
absolutely beautiful Hills are so hard
to show when they're not on so here is
me actually wearing the hills but I I
couldn't resist them no wear them
the day I got them because they are so
so beautiful and the second I saw them I
literally fell in love these are
probably one of my favorite heels I have
ever worn in my entire lifetime just
because the gold chain I just think is
so so pretty and again I haven't really
seen on another shoe it kind of looks
like it is I'm attached to the hill and
it's like a separate piece of jewelry
but it is actually attached to the hill
and also just like the different sizes
of the straps as well what are the
straps that have like go Monte's on and
then obviously the chain has the die
Monte's on I just overall thought these
are so pretty I think be for 35-pound
don't get me wrong but I think it looks
so much more expensive than they
actually are so I think there's also
like another bonus to them as well
because they just look so expensive
and really there wasn't that pricey at
all so I can resist not wearing them
do love them a lot I got them in like a
nudey kind of my beige color but they do
also sell them in black as well
obviously can't do a summer haul without
a good pair of sunglasses so I picked up
these lands oh my god
I'll learn and also I don't actually
have any shades like these these first
think I just say you can feel how good
quality they are like they're just so
thick and also so comfy it's kind of
like an unusual shape but I thought it
was pretty cool and also a really own
eye black and gold sunglasses so I
thought why not give it a first them now
my favorite jeans to wear of all time
are actually the Molly jeans from River
Island original wearing that's like the
past year now and I'm pretty much
obsessed and I'm pretty much every color
apart from a habit actually I want to be
Molly chickens before so these are
mid-rise jeggings and these except like
in a deep kind of like bluey color like
a dark kind of denim I also don't own
jeans like this color as well so I
thought why not give these ago there's
not really much to say about it but I'm
hoping and they do look good on so the
final thing I'm going to talk about
because so many of you guys again have
are see where this is Franck so wore
this recently so here you go guys it's
from River Island and it is kind of like
dusky sheer pink crop top which is kind
of like creamy floral print on it and
then also it has like these slowly kind
of cuffs which I literally love and
think makes the whole item look so
pretty I can it really love it I have a
ring but anything like it again it kind
of hangs down low and then it ties up
but I want this to a festival of like a
pair of denim shorts and thought kind of
like rocked out putting look pretty cool
so yeah from River
iron so thanks guys for compliments on
this top because I got so many and I
definitely will be wearing it again
another bonus I am love it actually
there is one of final thing I want to
show you I don't know how the hell I'm
going to carry it on my bed right now
let's give it an attempt okay
it is now I bet you guys didn't know so
everybody this is so hard I bet you
never knew river island cold sea cases
neither today until I saw this one I
came across this one oh I love it so
much
oh god dollars a blogger for the one its
suitcase I think it was a hundred pounds
which to be fair really isn't that bad
for a suitcase especially if it's so big
and I'm going to use it so much I love
it it's kind of like a black leather and
then also has these same prints and then
also it has the gold and snake pray
candles that I love I'm going to be
using this so much of my troubles
because you guys know I travel a lot so
I love this and you guys would
definitely be seeing this on my
channel and also another good thing my
favorite thing about it is it's for
world
I don't know how ever help people you
see cases they're only two wheels no I'm
a I'm a four wheeler yeah so with no
religion yeah I love and thank you so
much so I could not show you guys that
either on guys little cuter handle is
this may print handle I love it so much
and then oh god this is so hard and then
also it even has me like look at the
luggage label like how boy ELISA
okay the luggage label was also so nice
as well I just I love the gold I love
the same print I love everything about
it
if I if I couldn't find a suitcase it
probably wasn't like this so I'm going
