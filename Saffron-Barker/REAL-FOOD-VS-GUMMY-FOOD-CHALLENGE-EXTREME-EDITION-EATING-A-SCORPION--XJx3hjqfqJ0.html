video well I'm going to let my know
what's going on saffron's decided that
she's not gonna do the chili which means
she's going to have the gummies ok SAP
has got to do the last one
whatever is and I have to go be the last
one right guys so literally the reason
we've decided to do this is because I
would rather eat like scorpion or
eyeballs or anything rather than chili
because honestly record touch with my
tongue on that I will be crying until I
go to sleep tonight I like I do not do
well vending spicy so I'm going to go
for the chili garlic agent and then
we're going to swap after no I'm not
touching yours okay look I don't know
how you do that one is there this is hot
know what these gummies a hot glass it's
got me is burning my mouth this is not
the deal we made
thing this is not the other very what
I'm drawing
keep blowing my mouth no that's actually
really burning my mouth he squeezed a
hot one into water oh my god that was
not the deal that we made these also a
way I least we haven't really been
listen to you they're spicy
yes best I can try 100 think oh my
goodness I don't know how you've done
that I can never do that genuinely never
do that well having actually got chili
in it so she tricked me so basically I
have to do the last one now and I do
have cheese please

my tongue it's like on fire right now my
whole body is on fire
