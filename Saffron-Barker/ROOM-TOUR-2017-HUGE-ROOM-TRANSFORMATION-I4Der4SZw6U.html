where I got everything from and yet
basically give you a tour of my new room
which I'm so excited for okay so let's
go over to this area over here that's
actually shut the door because then we
can kill more things right okay so as
you can see on my door I have far too
many coats and jackets I have an
obsession with buying coats it's just
kind of my thing like to kind of have an
obsession with buying pretty much
anything closing wise you just see like
Pope's and jacket this is my Michael
Kors stuff bag backpack that I've had
for like a good two years and I used to
wear every single day until I got
meeting one over there so I'll show you
that in a minute okay so I'm going to
start with this corner over here so okay
here it's just like a little storage
place it's just my ring light this ring
light is from Amazon are you going down
to my feet my toes
I don't got any socks on okay so I got a
coffee doesn't look like it right let's
get away from the toes minis okay so
this here is different this longer
drawer is actually from Ikea and then
this candle is from father Bodyworks oh
my God my favorite candle ever this
mirror can I just say it doesn't look
like anything special but this is like
my best friend I use this every single
day it lights up it's from Amazon it's
really really cheap and occasionally I
could just sit on this desk here which
is basically like this lights my life
sitting desk and then this bit over here
that's my work area but we're going to
go back to this guy here okay so these
drawers are obviously the same but
smaller and these are called the Alexa
drawers from Ikea
then at these desktops obviously I just
bought separately and easily just put
them on yeah again they're from Ikea so
like these ones here I'm just going to
show you a little bit of what's inside
if you wanna come on this is one of my
favorite draws ever this has got all my
Urban Decay vice liquid lipsticks I am
in love with these I just think they're
so beautiful so come in here again with
these ones down here this just really
has makeup in it just loads and loads
and loads of makeup this is my eyelash
one
so messy but yeah that's my makeup no
this year this is actually really new I
only bought it yesterday and I used to
have the IKEA plant ports that everybody
seems to have their so knife I wanted to
like I would it something different so I
saw this one which is so cute it spins
around and I love like thee little like
crystal ball on top this is $9.99 from a
home cents and this has got all my eye
brushes in I'm not quite sure why
here is from eBay and I think if you
just search any like acrylic lipstick
holder that will come up again multiple
who at candle my polaroid this is from
Urban Outfitters these sunglasses I
think these are from player this is from
Urban Outfitters and these little things
if I my key off which I love and always
forget to water okay moving on this
chair here oh yeah I love this chair
going to see what it looks like it's
just like a clear plastic chair but it's
really cool and then piece of rock that
I have over the top is from Dunelm used
to actually be on my bed but it's really
fun feeling that's good like hang in
from the back kind of why I have it I'm
sure
okay we're moving over to my work desk
now okay so this area here this is
actually my work area is wearing it on
my editing data this is where I make my
videos this is my laptop here obviously
from Apple it's a MacBook Pro and my
desk top stickers from so this one that
I bought was actually really expensive
like the poster packaging I think you
can just get it from Amazon or whatever
just a marble sticker so it's not
cracked for everybody that always asks
and then the YouTube stickers are
actually from YouTube space yes like
here which I literally flip in love I
love the color I just think it looks
like kind of like vintage and tumbler II
I'm just I'm all about this light and
this is from red cherry just an online
website that I found and then this here
is kind of which is so cute by the way
is that you on the wrong month and don't
ask me it's all April it's me but it's
really cute because it's all pastel
color so it has like light pink pink
blue purple you kind of get the gist it
has yellow in it of the yellow and that
was one and 99 from the car battery I
was like yeah bargain because I like
pastel colors okay so we're actually
moving on to my actual like walking
things so this is my map this is the
biggest map I don't know what inch it is
but the bigger size is pretty pretty
huge
obviously from Apple my gold wider speed
I actually doing this for Christmas
Christmas on my birthday and but there's
an Apple as well this mic is pretty new
as well I'm loving it
do voiceovers and this is called the
snowball ice Mike it's really good it
was 60 pounds but it's definitely worth
the money because I do sir
did I boys ever since stop on my map
this is so much better that it's famine
them and yeah that's basically that and
then here this is just like another
cupboard that I got from Ikea and there
ain't no joke this is my favorite thing
ever it was when I bought it and it
still weighs now just like the best
thing so I'll just be like chit in here
right editing like doing my thing it's
just like you just just swipe you know
it's just like this is life like when
I'm born I generally just have my chair
oh breaking everything people that
follow my book channel even know that
because the like with y donde Lee I just
spin on my chair and this pillow here I
can't actually remember where this is
from I think it's from Dunelm
that's a little guess probably yeah
chairs from Ikea okay let's move on
right okay so the blind which I love by
the way so this point is from our goods
I've always wanted French shatters but
they're so ridiculously expensive and if
I take it what I wanted to look at them
into like 17 weeks or something so I
bought these ones so this one was a lot
cheaper I kind of got it like temporary
but now I actually love it and it
doesn't really have much difference so
I'm just going to stick with it peasant
of these the curtains I've even had this
for like a couple of years now it just
kind of like creamy silk cotton and we
just kind of tied them up people they
look a little bit cooler than having
them on the hooks as you can see my
plain white radiator behind me I'm
actually getting a new one this is my
wardrobe
I've had this for years as well I had it
in my old room very much like all of
this photo here I had in my old room
so research happy sheet this kind of
like saw the water it will come up I've
got my from some sort of like eBay Shop
therein and these ones here this is a
lot of mirrors inside here I just have
like my clothes and stuff so I mainly
like going out sort of quiet and I've
got so many pairs of shoes I kind of
need to sort my water about and then
and then all these half by the way these
are my new much I actually love them I'm
gonna put one on if you haven't checked
out my March then you uh you probably
should because how does this look okay
it's not on very well but this may work
much I feel like I should keep on now
for this now okay yes they're my hats my
March this wardrobe here this has like
jumpers and stuff like that here I love
when jumpers they're so comfy it's like
my favorite section down here I just
have more clothes in these drawers as
well oh my god this is so exciting this
is my name it new Vuitton backpack if
you follow my blogging channel you would
have seen how excited I was
I feel so lucky to have it I'm like I
love it so much when when Louie bag but
yeah I got this the other day so wanna
see the vlog is gonna link it down below
and then this here I also showed in my
room tour in 2016 in my old room this is
from Madeline and I believe it was 30
town so this is just really nice because
it's just a storage holder and I just
put my scarves and hats and stuff in
there as well so that's basically that
I've had it for years it's just a really
good storage holder hey guys it's me in
the picture but this here are my
pictures these are also part of my
merchandise I just think they're so cool
like yeah I just love everything about
it and these lips are actually my lips
so like I kissed on a piece of paper and
then they're enlarged and the pictures
but they just and they look really
really cool together so that is that and
it's really cool as well kind of like
fills up the space I've been needing to
fill up the space for such a long time
now I do you think I've got a bit of
black and white but also love like
splash color as well but kind of those
what my room is like but these drawers
that was really good Rosia these again
shabby-chic I think they just went from
some shabby sheep shop on eBay and this
just has right I'm going to go through
every door socks underwear bras shorts I
take more shorts
Chim Chim drawer and then this is my
jean draw these sassy letters these are
from England at home and they're about
10 pounds each hence why I got a Safi
not a saffron because and you know I do
want to be able to splurge that much so
describe this a B it was cheaper this
goal I've had for literally ever
this is actually my mum's but I stole it
from her so I don't know where that's
actually from and then this my friends
actually bought me for yeah they bought
it for when I hit 500k on this channel
so it's just like a picture of all of me
and my friends and then they put it like
in a really pretty like die Monty frame
which I just seems so sweet and I love
it so I always have that there and then
again we have the same part that I got
from home sense here that I got the
other day that have some of my brushes
in here our fuel my perfumes this is my
favorite person ever it's empty but this
is Lady million and that's amazing by
the way
oh my goodness I'm obsessed with this I
just remembered I didn't show you the
frame over there which I will show you
to have one really really similar but
this frame is actually from 14 North
Street in Brighton and what should they
have any other stores but I know that's
what it's called in Brighton and then I
have another one over there which I'm
going to quickly show you now and then
guys this picture here this one is from
the same shop 14 at North Street in
Brighton this here this is my Ted Baker
case I love this it's so so pretty I
love everything about it
and love the gold obviously from Ted
Baker the reason I actually need this in
my bedroom it is because if you follow
my fucking channel you will know I
travel a lot
so I always have a case my bedroom
because I'm always off somewhere so one
of the trouble blocks you guys don't
already so this light here okay so the
six are from Ikea and then I actually
just put them I just got some like
string lights you can get from eBay
Amazon pretty much anywhere really
really affordable I just kind of shoved
them just like scatter them around and
then this plant walk here
an old plant pot that we've generally
had forever it obviously was brown but
we just decided to paint it white and
now it's really changed the look of the
whole thing so yeah a little it really
cute in my bedroom with white because
everything is pretty much white in my
bedroom these side tables here again
from the same shabby chic shop however
the handles missing on this runner which
is a great look and then the things on
top this is the picture of me and my
friends up from this my friend actually
bought me I think she got it for
Christmas it's just really really cute
it has me and my friends inside and like
a little snowball really pretty this
kind of again obviously guys know me by
now hopefully you should want a body
wash but now let's go on to be best part
okay let's go over let's go over let's
google them the bed oh my god I can see
their spider got the double chins and
everything at this one my bed I just
like kind of brings everything together
because obviously you have a bit of like
the black white and gray and then you
have like the splash of color in the
middle
so this duvet set is from Urban
Outfitters and I just really like it I
just think it's really really cool and
you know this from urban apertures yes
that idea is from forever 21 this one is
from Urban Outfitters my favorite colors
yellow at the moments and seconds I saw
this I was like yes all about that's a
lie
and then then this pillow here is from
forever 21 as well so that's been
tripping on my bed
these are run out I feel fine any more
batteries but these are just like little
string white lights from I think those
from Amazon and then this part guys wait
can I just say my mom is so sad
okay so sad that there isn't be a
million-plus up there yet is so yes
she's actually drilled a hole she's got
it ready for the day that I hit a
million if I ever a million
she's actually drilled the hole ready so
you know what to do you guys but as you
guys can see I have my other packs up
here so these are both for hitting a
hundred K this is by hitting a hundred K
on my blogging channel and this is
hitting 100 camera main channel the
reason they are different sizes because
this is a new plaque that's come out and
this is the old one so
literally I was so lucky to get like one
of the last of ones left pretty much so
that's why the different sizes so wait
are they moving in which is even bigger
so subscribe ok these flowers oh my god
you would have seen in the blogs
I actually got given these free this man
in Tesco's get me them for free and I
was like why not take them yellows vapor
color this book our meeting at the
moment and it's called the secret and it
really just opens it really makes you
like think about life it just yes if
you're an over-thinker I don't know if
it's cool about because I'm an
over-thinker and it's um is is really
maybe look at things from a different
point of view but it's a really good
book I definitely recommend you and then
obviously we have my vlogging camera
