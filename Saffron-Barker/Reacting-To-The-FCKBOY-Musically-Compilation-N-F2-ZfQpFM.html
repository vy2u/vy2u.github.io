I'm stealing the glasses I thought I
need my own hair you know he's kind of
cute I'm already put in like the chain
but like I would say that his opinion
might use preference that's kind of cool
though like I guess so it's all good at
this point you know like true but your

small oh my gosh
I understand if you have loads of apps
you know but I need the self confidence
oh no he's actually so cute but it's
just so weird like message to a little
brother like honestly he looks about
six-year-old
anybody know how old this boy is let me
know down below
good ones okay I guess what I really
know you folks I got a bad girl oh that
transition no that was cool
it is the same person I feel like it I'm
already putting the body Ripple what's
that one about I don't know yeah it's
too much like body but this makes me
feel so uncomfortable I don't know about
anybody else but oh that's cool the
glasses look pretty cute I don't know
what this whole I having in so like
every week I feel like every boy I've
watched is topless violet there's
literally no need I wouldn't understand
like if you walked out the gym loads and
you're massive muscle but you wanted to
show them off but only it's got a cute
oh that's not cute no I'm all feeling
that it's does any which does anybody
find that a truck I want even bring
myself to do that so we all find that
attractive I don't
oh goodness like whoa oh he's cute okay
he is pretty cute
I like this hat as well with three nice
I don't know the whole like feeling the
body thing is though oh no wait is that
the same guys earlier I hear pretty good
oh no no none and I'm not feeling that
lip thing like that makes me stuff that
makes us all sick inside that the whole
tongue thing good nigh this is weird and
your dis will decay could do better
lighting but it's okay I guess
what was it growth up quite good though
to be fair that like white winner like
oh my goodness is so flippin cute oh wow
here's so cute oh my oh hey it's a lot
away but he is cute but like really ah
that's weird wait it's the guy from
earlier right anybody asking compute

tongue it is weird right this was a
little bit more chill day I guess it's
okay Oh sick I bothered this guy must be
really popular because he's been on here
like quite a bit
oh that was sick my hair sir oh yeah I
thought this is more like a joke you
alright he looks like five no living
speeches old
no no can we just pause it out I have no
words I have like I can't even watch
that back I have no word I'm losing my
voice yeah that was so weird in every
way genuinely that kid looks so young
like if I had his parents seen that like
that was weird that made me feel so
uncomfortable there's like yet again
okay I feel like each other go through
some good transition now oh yeah so
that's pretty cool
like I'm not a fan on the lit by it but
I feel like he kind of rocks it you know
as I know these kids from somewhere
isn't kind of cool
they kind of kiichi oh oh this one's
good
I like this blonde oh why is there it be
but that was good what no I just wonder
like has a parent Cena and he's back
with the tongue or you going on why it's
a tons of ripple like I just know only
see most people so uncomfortable do you
guys have you know down in the comments
like do you find I attractive because to
me that is that is like so unattractive
you know gonna change me I love the song
you don't give me the hold on I gotta
think of my voice ah sorry Thomas
I was respect to make a bigger jumpy
transition than interesting kids
standing there all over so no they're
gonna cue ah I was this kid again wasn't
doing though I don't know that was
coming or twice and oh yeah uh I kind of
live for this kid now like you guys do
quite good at music please oh he's cute
I don't know I just don't like the
ripple though honestly quite get that I
guess like this is like great in times
the music which is really good
this just makes me feel uncomfortable
honestly like I don't find this
attractive like yeah so same kid again I
feel like he must be huge on this ah he
reminds me of like a Jacob satorious bow
that nobody wanted me I guess that like
about all these boilers all these
younger boys are looking after Jacob
throughout this video so I don't know if
Jake himself and hello for new ripple
thing as well which he does and no
that's not me why is it oh I probably
shouldn't stop the whole video here now
I feel like I've definitely seen enough
we've got two six minutes 50 in I feel
like I've definitely seen enough
throughout this video I am honestly
shocked like very shocked I can't
believe how many young kids of 40
reckonings filling themselves like
what's this I can't even bring myself to
do it but was this hotel thing about
like that's genuinely weird like I can't
believe how many young kids I just
wanted to like do those parents so that
brothers that anybody their salaries see
them do that or if I don't know like to
me I've said it before but I think it's
unattractive but like makes me feel
really uncomfortable when watching them
