hope you guys all having an awesome day
so far so for today's video I've got a
phone and I've got a boyfriend the
boyfriend is not here with me right now
but with my phone I'm going to be
pranking my boyfriend now I've been
seeing the trend go around with pranking
my boyfriend with song lyrics pranking
with my friends with song merits and I
thought that is a genius idea and I
didn't really love watching these videos
and as those of you guys have always
said to me all you need to get Jake back
you need to get Jake back because my
boyfriend he is pranked me like I think
three times now and I've never ever had
a chance to get it back so hopefully
this video I can get hit that but you
could end up being a complete fail
however I've kind of chosen a song I
think you might not know as well so
hopefully that it was a song that I'm
using is Canon Scott dancing on my oath
let's do this right here it goes Jake if
you poop with us I'm really sorry and if
you don't you worry on my video so bring
it up varnishing what are you talking
about love heart
laughing BAE a Sheila
what are you talking about why no love
us big black sky over man at this point
I just want to say every time Jake and I
message each other we always put love
hearts to each other and if we don't
there would be implant like it means
we're being blunt okay and like we
hardly ever not put love hearts to each
other so right now he's gonna be so
confused but I think you already is
saffron what is wrong with you I'm
showing on what you're talking about
okay I don't know how many exhumation
marks a question marks he put that I
think there's like 15 oh no I don't know
he's getting upset or he's getting mad
right now but I'm pretty sure he's
getting mad but he still put a lover I'm
norming yeah like I said I'm at home a
bitch oh my god where have you got this
Rob who's she okay now I've already
Ballack's lovey things I'm really hungry
