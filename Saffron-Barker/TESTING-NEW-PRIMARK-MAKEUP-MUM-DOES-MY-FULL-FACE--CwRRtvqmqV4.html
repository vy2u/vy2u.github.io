channel and now for today's video i'm
joined by mom as you guys can see and
today we are going to be testing or i
might make up yes we are a night fight
about pretty excited about actually yeah
no i have actually done this video
before and you guys seem to love it
however it was with the old prime up
makeup and i say i can't remember what
the number was but it was something like
if we get to seventy thousand eyes i'll
do a part two so that's why we're
sitting here right now however i thought
from hopper - why not twist it up a
little bit so fashion it's me yeah we've
got my mom to apply the full face or
private makeup to my face so as you can
tell i'm pretty bad face right now you
really are oh really
yes i look very pale and i need to get
some makeup on me so I'm really hoping
that this prymaat makeup is good so
everyone I really hope you will enjoy
this video if you do that makes you hit
a big thumbs up and subscribe down below
if you guys have it already knows about
let's get into it
we're starting off with this which is
the hydrating prep spray okay
and this is five pound but like who buys
a texture didn't know I'm surprised I
didn't give me that for free then there
to make me anyway anyway it's still
going so yeah don't any matter media oil
and I'm gonna animal and should get that
back but it's an amino acid so I'm going
out now but it doesn't matter my should
protect skin which I sometimes it
tightens pork right so let's just go
straight in with this we're gonna have
some of this hydrating prep spray okay
oh my goodness I defeat you may be able
to me mouth okay yeah I feel like it
doesn't obviously feel like anything it
feels like water but it smells like
roses it's quite 192 Julia yeah get the
full art I think you just dry it off a
bit I know we should that every morning
but you can come in and help me just
perfect so far so good that smells
really good hog breath smells so good
yes it died us yes it does anyway I
would give this a hit even though it
hasn't obviously done that much but it
smells refreshing
yeah and it's a fiber and yeah we say
that the texture its body but in know
you advocate my next stop I'm gonna go
with the foundation okay yeah okay oh
can I can I do the honors
so this is a perfect finish foundation
it's a medium coverage and it's semi
matte finish with vitamin E it's only
250 which i think is obviously an
absolute bargain is actually yeah if it
works pretty affordable the only thing
I'm kind of concerned about with this is
I hate matte finishes just because I
just hate them they just don't sit on my
skin nicely at all but on the plus side
it does have a vitamin E as well how can
you feel to get in first cutting it I
guess can I go looking at this
personally I'm feeling like you've got
the absolute wrong color yeah I was
thinking that I couldn't be bothered to
a key like I don't want to do it in the
store maybe because it's give it guy a
new skin isn't that bad yeah to be fair
oh my goodness yes maybe but to be fair
my face is so much whiter than the rest
of my body
then you do like it down yeah I'd like
you to be a lot darker primer here no
there isn't any primer I can find in it
I don't know they do primer let me know
down below if you've ever bought prime
are from Primark or not do you know what
I love and I think you just grab it
ahead and chips just put me in position
and there I am attending you know even
if he was amazing nobody I want to get
that make a dumper usually I'm not
always there that's a good job and this
is looking very very orangey we're not
rich but just dark for you sorry that's
not even bad I would say I can't say
thing got it all on my eye yeah well
your
in the way so thanks getting found a
tribe of me not have eyes
yeah I do that's quite an honor just be
quiet it's like over your mouth places
that's just heaven heaven heaven which
is quiet right I don't know cause I just
need to so good actually looks all right
oh my goodness oh you're not the
gentleness on you so if I don't do a
good enough job but you can actually
leave on all day if it's really good
yeah but I don't know the real test
isn't it to see how it lasts and stuff
yeah that's true
right next up concealer by the way did
you say all this stuff is from the PS
range of now yes so this is I think
everything again like I think it's one
half if t yeah you've no two pounds ok
so again it's pretty affordable it's a
medium comfort it has a vitamin E and
aloe vera so again it's made to be quite
healthy if your skin look the only thing
is it was like the only thing with
Primark is it's like literally my
favorite stores ever but when it comes
to the makeup section it's quite hard to
find like what well I know it shade to
be fair and brighten it yeah I don't
know why I think it's it just gets like
quite messy it just needs to be a bit
more organized maybe I don't know what
it it's just our store we don't come
yeah maybe selection it's not very good
the bright ones not very good improve
the Bryan stop yeah please yeah was a
great sorry we're gonna do this to go
you've really scare me a little home
Ohio it looks a little bit it's a little
bit like putting lip gloss on why
because it's almost like melting as I
know I got my creamy that's good
it's hard to tell because it's such a
similar similar color yeah it is a tiny
bit lighter but not much really there's
not much in it in there no so
no I really be going frightening but
that's kind of my fault can I just say
as well guys I am the palest I have ever
been in my life
and I hate it I've just got well some
tan that it literally makes me look like
an absolute ghost this actually looks
really nice like yes I said it let's
kind of creamy yes I've seen the Mike on
my right Shay
I've never seen easier to go that much
lighter I think just a shower maybe a
little bit especially the color that I
am what to fix I think it's just any
improvement at the last minute when my
hair like Oh
everything okay we're going out louder
baking powder this is it ideal for
baking
Oh check your mom we're gonna bake no it
has a bake oh my actual goodness is gone
everywhere he goes can I see yeah but it
is that we've just opened a bottle of
talking family is loaded off our just
think this is unnecessary though really
for like a daily routine you don't need
to be baking it does make a difference
well maybe not this one but I don't know
like this one might work as well
obviously but say all before
I just think Germany people every day
you're not there through all this
malarkey people do that just what
profession of you like is very you don't
do this every day that you know probably
just we just brush it out could be nice
today I've been ain't gonna sit for a
few minutes so we're gonna run hey let
me turn out oh this is Brady wanna go
out tonight
but I don't know if I'm a couple that's
good gonna go here to go to real a boy
[Laughter]
okay bye it's baked okay why not like in
this video can you actually fit me yeah
oh you're really gentle powdery okay so
it wasn't you I'm gonna have a bones and
eggs you can actually have a bronzer I
do not shadow annoying I'm gonna get
darker blusher yeah the more brownie one
for this which I don't know what it's
gonna look like and I'm gonna frame I
want to play level more on the brush I
feel like I'm doing it again so gentle
so annoying is gonna thin something it's
not amazing they're zombies
I wouldn't break this to be fair we're
not really using it for the right thing
I mean but it's not very good but how
would this actually being used as a
blusher anyway last bit Dalton anyway I
don't really right there nice that's fun
about dates okay then we're going to use
which is the same thing basically I
which is yes again it's a blusher again
because it is rotating mask of holiday
that's a shaky this is how much quite
brown as well I think yeah oh wow that's
quite um pigmented okay oh it definitely
not this is a really nice color
if you were gonna really got rust to
keep bronzy color but yeah hard I see a
splash of that scratching you know any
not sound right so next I'm gonna go
with the highlighter yeah this is kind
of like the one thing we is really like
worried about just because it does it
looks like none raging I mean it might
not prove us wrong but I I'm detective
like I love highlights so much I don't
like this one I might you know I like to
highlight quick yeah yes I love my life
is a bit old okay actually it's buffing
up you can see it's got more of a
shimmer in actually so let's the hearse
oh no it's so so you know you come down
so it's subtle but it's nice I don't see
any shimmer
really think so that's pretty much face
done yeah so now we're going on to eyes
yeah eyes we've got the cutest palate
with mom nice to do this weird thing
which does mascara fur right do mascara
furs if I get it already waiting on the
eyelids if I couldn't get it off without
ruining the whole eyelid but I do this
mascara really nice and the packaging
was so nice we think the packaging for
all of this stuff is pretty yeah this is
the palette you're the pallets are
actually on it this is six pounds and
each he has like so many good Connors it
has a black and white which not many
pallets have and then it also has like
glows I'm like nice pretty like neutral
it's just so good how much I don't like
what our six pounds they give this is
pigmented and doesn't like it's a
fullback okay a hundred percent i'll be
using this like without a doubt so this
is definitely a good one for beginners
as well it's quite subtle but has a bit
of everything anyways I've got one two
eyes the mum said it in mascara and I'm
really scared
I open a shop look at me yeah but I've
shot already shot I like the brush this
would not be the brush that you like you
don't know I found a on someone
else anyway
like I've never done it before and it's
not the easiest thing yes No oh my god
you can't bring this on the makeup
product it's definitely down to you and
I do not want your spits on me thank you
very much
so Brown wise to really cool things
actually we got this one yeah which was
to pound and it's got the the gel the
brow gel gel spoon only tweezers and the
brow pencil yeah they were shoes that
one that was 2 pounds yeah
I don't owe any money other volunteers
I'm gonna use man yeah it's like mine it
was five pounds okay I you want to do
y'all make up you don't me I am NOT
doing it's not a chance in hell I'm
using it so so this is what I would
normally use the severance assistance
I'm using the pencil I don't know why
this started up this is a really nice
thing this is five pounds I was
definitely definitely bought this one I
just think I uh I've never seen use a
brown pencil it's pretty what's the
profits it would not be this dark
I guarantee let's give it a go and see
how much it's like Wheeling's just do it
quite lightly when the blend I am aware
okay thank you guys thank you advice
though okay oh this doesn't really come
out like me this is literally
everybody's it's so dark way too dark
look I'm not being funny you're just
ruining my god I don't
is this unless you've got black hair do
not buy the brown one there must be a
light brown one on imagine you're just
trying to make me look like I'm
literally completely useless her dad not
amazing but it's okay so then we're
gonna go in the pallet right I'm gonna
go for this kind of golden fellowship
