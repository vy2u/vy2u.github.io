so I hope you've all had an amazing week
so far so for today's video I'm actually
going to be doing a haul now I know you
guys might be thinking Saffron why never
haul but you know I know shopping you
guys love watch knows and every time I
do a whole video I always get asked can
you please show us you'll close on like
actually try on your clothes so I
thought you know what what a great idea
I'm going to do a try on haul
obviously it's been my birthday recently
so I've had some birthday money and the
money I was supposed to be saving up I
spend quite a lot of it on clothes
hence this hole so that's how I got all
of the clothes that I brought from this
haul but don't you guys worry because I
have got you guys and little something
to most of the clothes I bought is
actually from Topshop so I thought why
not give away either a Topshop or top
man pouch and this is going to be a 250
pounds voucher which is so awesome and
as I'm using the app Yarbrough law and I
know those of you guys are as well I
thought why not give this away on your
if you guys don't follow me on board and
go follow it because that's exactly how
you can win this voucher is so easy I'm
going to explain exactly what to do in a
minute but if you guys do follow my
elbow you guys will know that I've been
using it ahead of a lot and it's so
awesome as well because I keep getting
joined all of your group chats and I get
to speak to you guys on there so like
yeah it's really cool so if you guys are
doing like route chats and double the
major to add me to it so I can come say
hi but let's go on to the instructions
so on my elbow I'm going to be posting a
picture of myself in Topshop clothes and
my brother in top man clothes it's so
simple all you have to do is go over
there and vote if you want to win a top
mark better or a top shot voucher and
randomly on Friday the 5th I will be
announcing a winner the winner is chosen
completely at random it's so easy to go
follow me on your ball I'm going to put
the link down below and also I'm going
to put the download link to y'all down
below as well so good that's all of you
and let's get into this video what's the
first thing I got from Topshop is
actually these Topshop ripped Johnny
jeans now these are more elasticity
rather than a luxury because I did have
these for about a year and a half and
these are like my favorite jeans ever
only ever really get to some top
as they are my favorite I love
high-waisted and they're so comfy and I
love them with rips in but unfortunately
I did a DIY video with Jake and let's
just say I got paint all down my jeans
and they were completely ruined and I
was like oh I'm gonna have to get some
more so I quickly rushed out and I got
these Donnie Jean from Topshop and I'm
so glad they have them because I'm gonna
live and die in them again
as you can see they come up very high it
the way they have rips on both of the
knees they are so comfortable they are
very like stretchy which is why I love
them the feeling of them are so good so
these are the Johnny jeans you probably
see me wear these a lot because I live
and die in these and I'm gonna live and
die in them again so their thing I got
from Topshop was this light blue cami is
the most gorgeous color which is why I
absolutely loved it and again if you
guys know me you will know they
absolutely love wearing Cubby's they're
so comfortable and they pretty much grow
anything I love the color of this one so
much it was 16 pound from Topshop and
the back of its really cute as well
because it has like double straps oh
yeah I really like this and it's
definitely a good purchase this is just
another wardrobe must-have it's really
comfy you can dress it up where you can
dress it down it's just really easy to
wear this knows hm absolutely fell in
love straightaway and this is this
cropped white jacket with elastic at the
bottom and the fabric is kind of like a
linen fabric it is such a cool jacket
this was 45 pounds remember island it's
quite expensive it is quite plain but I
don't know I just think it stands out
and it looks quite special the next item
that I got is from River Island again
and it's a really lightweight beige
jacket and I must say it's one of my
favorite things that I've brought out of
this whole entire clothing haul as I
said it's really lightweight so really
it's just a summer jacket
as you can see you can roll the sleeves
up or you can leave them down however
you choose to wear it I'm also
absolutely loving this beige color next
up is this really cool bag and this is
home Topshop and it was 32 pounds I love
this because it's camo and of course I
absolutely love pretty much anything
that's come on I love the shade of this
bag I brought it mainly because I need a
new gym bag but also this is going to be
great for traveling skroeder you can
have the smaller handles too
or you can use their long strap either
over your shoulder or across your body
also because of the shape and the size
you can get a lot in this bag so next up
you might want to pause it now and put
your sunglasses on because I have got
this bright well I say bright yellow
it's more combustible yellow-green it's
a very weird yellow but it's very bright
I would only wear this if I had a suntan
orbit it's like very sunny that day
you've got to kind of use your
imagination now and imagine I'm Brown
because when I'm brown I have a feeling
this place suit is gonna look a lot
nicer than it does now I love this bits
on the shoulders and as you can see it
has like a bout of waste places are
definitely one of my favorite things to
wear and I think this is perfect for a
summer night out or dwell on holiday ah
so good luck trying to get these MedX
item if you want to get them because
I've been waiting like months the minute
they came out I wanted these and holy I
have got them oh my goodness I cannot
believe it they restocked the day I went
into the shop so very honest sliders
with Puma and they are I don't know even
out at the it's bent a little fact
though this is actually her last name so
always good as I open up the box this is
what they look like and then how cute is
the bag and you get this suede bag to
keep them in and then you open up and
just wow I was so I decided with the
colors by the way I was so undecided if
I wanted pink or black so then I thought
pink is gonna get dirty so quickly but
ended up getting black and this is what
they look like these are from office and
there were 55 pounds one thing I do have
to say is I actually got the size
smaller and the woman in the shop
recommended me to get the size smaller
because I just tend to come up quite big
so I got the size down to what I
normally am and if they're absolutely
perfectly there's not much to say about
these shoes apart from they are so cute
they're just slides from female but the
birds may get absolutely adorable I
don't know I'm going to be wearing these
loads and loads and then I'm all gonna
try these on bookid exists socks but
these are socks i got the river island
and there were three four eight pounds I
had these when I was like nine but I
don't know I still find them adorable
and I do think they look cute with like
trainers I go to White pairs and one
palooka they're designed little ankle
socks afro
their ikki last but not least so if you
want to go grab this you're going to
have to grab it quick I've wanted this
was so long and finally it's in the sale
I've got it's in the sales were twenty
pounds and it was originally 35 so I was
like Shaboom and I have these shoes to
match I was going to go like so
perfectly I just love the color so much
is that light blue it's pretty much the
same light Buddha kami that I brought
earlier but this is a kimono that I
would usually wear over a bikini but
it's so pretty that I would also wear it
with either like a shorts and top or
even like with jeans I love the lace
details like the sides and then the
sparkly pattern is just like finishes it
off perfectly that was everything that I
bought it was such a good shopping trip
and I absolutely love everything that I
brought and hopefully with the voucher
whoever wins about sure hopefully you
can go out and have an amazing shopping
trip as well so good luck with that I'm
really really excited to see the winner
