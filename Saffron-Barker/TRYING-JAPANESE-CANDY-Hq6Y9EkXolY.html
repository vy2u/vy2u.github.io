to robot the Casey and his girlfriend
Nicole we are so lucky because I've got
set this box from this company called
mod more calm and I will link everything
of those below their website their
Twitter and Facebook etc in the bio
below as well as Casey's YouTube
channels being linked below as well to
make sure you go check it out
I've got it all of us in the social
media and let's just get through it into
the video right let's see what we've got
inside but this or more quickly that
please meet up yes so good I can
actually reach up there this is called
the crisp chocolate okay Casey contact
to be Japanese but it just generally
says Chris topic I think it has like a
pancake flavor and it has piping on it
so I'm so excited to eat it I'm not
looking forward to this while there's
have a breakfast ball
oh my god smell oh oh my god it's not so
good
this is what it looks like I don't want
it to fall out but it's like a big
circle it's a good donor well it doesn't
look like a to one on the love doesn't
maintain so yeah what I mentioned might
be like a professional just a little bit
because I went in one is it so yummy
just case I like Mahara now it's filling
it melts in your mouth and then you've
just got loads of sugar inside the core
vacate
but copy caramel nearly full of sugar
that's basically what I can just say is
sugar and caramel
on the packet we have no idea what it
says
and it has a picture of noodle was when
I decided it is actually noodle - it's
gonna be sweet but yet again you're
asleep I don't think it must be so much
but look it has a picture of soup has
like water and peas in it I still think
it will be sweet so I stand by sweets
know if you have to cook this right it
says dear why kit where you can make
your very own candy ramen and Ginoza I
do not know how you say well easy to
make and the end result is yummy so it
is please oh yeah oh my god everything's
in the very right goodness three
different powered things here
Julia what's it I think it's like a
sugar thing but it's a bit more foamy
I clearly put some water in here there's
like three different sections that we
have no idea what we're doing little bit
like half the way
it was nice link oh yes it's priceless
really is it let's dip it in I think
we're doing wrong
I think so but yeah you can't even taste
the sauce I think I think it has too
much water in it yeah you're going to
Cole I would have to say I give the
first one a 10 out of 10 like I would go
too short and by that there's I don't
think I would ever go in the shop I'm
fine it so this I wanted to travel it
your way again I have water as well like
who goes in a shop by holding they leave
go home yeah thank you them
yeah awesome yeah I don't like it that's
like a two out of ten because I'm now
one thing that is actually nice but the
other thing just does meal the thing is
you can genuinely taste the sauce it's
not disgusting you can't taste it and
who brings water with over everywhere
like coming after Ward ready to eat it
or hold on I'm going to open a package
right
here yeah so be I would say one okay
yeah how'd you say no in Japanese no no
no no I didn't want to try this one I
know this one in the Box is the fried
chicken no I know my chicken smell it oh
it's like fish food one H they go yeah
you have to drive me please a pioneer
the sucker normal Chris oh no it's not
wait he fell it doesn't taste like it's
the least famous or thing when I fast
all right
I thought obviously it's really fishy
and now it tastes more like it rates the
more just like a really no favor Chris
yeah you think smell puts me off I could
smell it when it was there then you put
up close to my nose
no thank you 200 10 again 100 shut up
Sam
it's just not flavor this is like an ice
cream but it obviously can't the ice
cream we got a set in a post it has a
mouth I'm guessing it's like cake and
mousse inside
yeah maybe it looks mousse like house
like funky thing this is what it looks
like but it is actually focused on it
but it just basically looks like an ice
cream are we gonna share this Munda
