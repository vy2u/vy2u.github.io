channel now as you can see Halloween is
gonna be here before we know it and
Halloween is such a big thing now in the
UK and it's such an exciting time
however the only bummer thing is the
fact that you have to spend so much
money on a costume for one night so in
today's video I'm gonna be testing out
and letting you guys know my costumes
that I think look the best from eBay for
under 10 pounds so I'm really hoping
they do look like the picture you know
what eBay is like you never already know
what you're gonna get so they could be
awful but some of these might be great
so hopefully they might help a lot of
you guys out or hopefully they might
basically tell you to not order anything
from eBay because they might absolutely
suck and you'll be very disappointed on
the day because trust me this happened
to me before and it's the worst and most
stressful thing of your entire life when
you're trying to get a costume on the
day so don't do that okay and let me
know if you have done that as well
because I feel like that's very
relatable but yeah I'm gonna be testing
them out so I hope you guys do enjoy
under 10 pounds as well it was pretty
affordable so I hope it does help you
guys out smash a like and subscribe down
below if you guys haven't already and
without further ado let's get into the
video I was so excited so let's go okay
so first up we're gonna start with this
one here as I said I haven't actually
looked at any of these so this one here
was a pump it D and it's the scary
daughter from The Addams Family which by
the way I haven't actually seen a but I
feel like this outfit can look scary but
still pretty cute now it doesn't look
absolutely like amazing online but it I
think it's gonna be one of those it
looks how it actually is like I feel
like a lot of things that look amazing
online just look nothing like that so
hopefully fingers crossed is just like
the picture this is one I think because
there's no I'm massively costumes you
definitely have to have the makeup and
stuff that goes with it so we could also
it cute as well as scary cuz trust me I
know there's a lot of guys and girls
that just want to look cute rather than
just scary however me yeah I want to go
all out this year oh it feels really
like cheap but to be fair most costumes
do really don't they I'm definitely
gonna have to try this on and see
because the material doesn't really
cheap and to be honest I thought there'd
be a little bit more to it like I
thought every did at least come with the
socks
however is just the dress so it has the
collar and then honestly just like a big
black piece of material what is he
just hasn't really got much going for it
and my guess is a really weird it's like
not that tight with them not that loose
either like it's a little bit strange
and it's just like there could be so
much more to this I mean this just looks
really cheap bad policy I wouldn't wear
this out so I'm gonna have to give this
a thumbs down I really wanted to give it
a thumbs up as well okay this is
definitely a cute one but is packaged so
weird me honestly when this arrived i
just opened the bag like it's open
squash down like it's so strange and
look how this has been packaged up is so
weird
so let's open it give it a go okay it
definitely leaves a little bit of an eye
in and a little bit of shaking out but
actually overall is so cute like if you
wanna go as a pumpkin this is Sookie it
was seven pound 99 and I mean I'm so
excited to put this on like you think I
don't actually know if I to go out with
this hat but oh wait I'm doing that so
wrong right here it goes okay I don't
have to do this properly okay I'm going
to show you in a minute
well actually have the whole question
well but these are so cute and even
comes the bag you can go
trick-or-treating with this outfit as
well $7.99 what a bargain okay so far
this is the thumbs up for me let me know
what you guys are thinking okay so I do
actually not this one I'd like it's
definitely too young for me and it's
very short as well like you couldn't all
wear this on its own I was planning to
but honestly like the back comes on down
very easily and my whole bar was out and
you guys seriously do not want to see
that
so overall like I actually think this is
the most adorable thing I've ever seen
for me personally is way too young but I
do love the Hat and I look at this we're
gonna try out it could look so good
maybe it was a child without their I'm
sure we said a doll like I don't know
how to get this is thumbs up or not
because it is quite good it's just it's
not me I do love it I'm gonna give a
thumbs up but not right at all front of
kid okay next up is
cheerleader I feel like this is such a
classic so many like teen girls vs.
Halloween I actually did wear this maybe
a couple of years ago and I think it
cost me about like 35 pounds
however this one was let me just check
on eBay
Maurice in orders ok it was 7 of pounds
and 99 so maybe I'll be getting my
questions from eBay from now on because
why did I pay 35 pounds for a
cheerleading outfit it's so ridiculous
fancy dress shops are really expensive
online is so much cheaper so oh she
looks good as well again obviously the
material feels kind of thin but
obviously it would like that's what
costumers are meant to be like so this
is what it looks like it's the chair
dress that's quite good so far and the
bottom and then it even comes in Tom I
mean the knots about pom-poms but
they're still pom-poms let these are the
little pom-poms oh they are cute though
yeah free cute who came with some socks
with a bit better but for $7.99 socks
are public and exhaust you like a pound
still gonna be under a tenner so pretty
much overall I think this is good I've
decided I now want to be a cheerleader
because I'm feeling the pom-poms penny
in it this outfit kind of is what it is
like there isn't really much to it I
would say it's ok if I had to wear it
out I definitely would do the only thing
is like it's a little bit basic but
there isn't really much going on I feel
like if you went to another store you
can probably get one for around the same
prize which has a lot more detail a lot
more with it so I think if you've got a
loved have an effort into this outfit I
thought it couldn't really good so have
you added some socks as well like some
register of yourself I mean I would wear
out it's not the best thing I've ever
seen but I'm gonna give it a thumbs up
because they do still like this outfit
so this one was pretty close to 10
pounds it was 986
now this if this looks good this is I
think I will go as a spa on Halloween
because this is a vampire bat girl and
oh my god I'm obsessed with a vampire
diary so if you guys are let me know
down below because I watched it twice
now sorry and I just love it anyway I
want to be a vampire this Halloween so
hopefully it's the course between a
vampire bat oh my god it's really
confusing that is so cool I love this
okay so it's like a
so we know how to spray it's like a
jacket with wings I guess and they'll
all like vampire is or the bat is
whatever you want to call it I'm gonna
call it vampires because but oh my god
oh my god
wait decide your place ooh the only
thing I'm thinking is if it hangs really
no it might look kind of weird look like
you've just gone to the toilet because
like you know if it's like a really
baggy place it could look kind of weird
but if it's a little bit tight then I
feel like this could look really good
and I'm loving the wings as well like
this looks more expensive so fingers
crossed this one looks good because I'm
so eager to give this a go oh my god
this is the coolest thing like YouTube
might ever where they sell something
like hi it's up front
ok guys hello and live so this is the
name outfit which by the way I am
literally loving so much I think it's
the cutest thing ever even cars it would
be shades as well which I didn't realize
at the time but have a look love it so
much and I'm just loving these ears
honestly I think this outfit is so cute
again it's quite tie it's quite sure but
I just want this is so I would
definitely wear this like I think this
is such a good outfit I think again I'd
probably wear like tights or maybe like
socks or something just to please like
ridiculous or but overall I think I'm
definitely gonna give this a thumbs up
another one which is like weirdly
vacuum-packed it looks so strange that
she looks like something's died did you
huh
so I think this is the zombie alright I
think it's a zombie nuts I can't open it
up I'm struggling I should have got
scissors but we haven't say nope it's
stronger oh okay I got it
this one is yes and that's right oh my
god okay this looks the chief cuts out
of all of them because the fabric soaked
in on this it looks like somebody's like
throwing plates of ham at you or Italy
it just looks like absolute poo all over
your dress so to me this isn't really
quite like the picture hi guys this is
the next one that this is the enough
outfit I did let me get see I've got my
bright pink bikini buttons underneath to
be fair they are quite pink
but this is so see-through like I could
never wear this out and as
said it just as a collected ham or just
like absolute like somebody's gone
forward toilet on yourself like this is
not good in my opinion and plus like the
only thing that I think that's kind of
course the hairband and this but then
you can't talk if you have it on so
what's the point
so this is like for me it's the one
which is definitely a thumbs down and
there's so my final outfit is Alice in
Wonderland now it's not the Alice that I
recently played I was highly someone'd
and I was like a photoshoot and it was
so cute but everything we got was like
was actually from eBay but it was like
or eBay I think it's some of it was like
from hey to Nana just normal stores and
that only cost about 15 pounds this one
I think is it $9.99 the outfit that I
have was literally incredible let's hope
this one is this is good but I feel like
when you buy things separately and get
them from normal stores it can't
sometimes up better than just buy it
well them from eBay sometimes do
you are buying it and doing it self is
better because looking at the ex like
actually it does look quite good but not
quite like the one that I had like that
was so good see that okay PAP she looks
really good I like this that's actually
pretty good
just the dress alone I feel like it
could be a lot better I would wear this
but I don't know probably things well
you could just go DIY it for another
fiber but understand pounds of Venus's
that's alright don't no one here is the
Alice in Wonderland costume I'm not even
sure like how I feel about it
I feel like it has so much potential but
if I'm comparing it to my Alice and
wonderland gosh that the Dean calls too
much more I don't feel like it amazing I
feel like also it's so short like I'm 5
foot I'm nearly 5 foot 2 which is pretty
sure in general so unless you have the
tiniest body going like this is not
gonna fit you if it's the perfectly here
but it's just ridiculous eShop so and
then sha what about having your bum out
on Halloween which is not me then it is
just not kind of like good so even
though it does have someone to attend to
it does look kind of cute I think I'm
gonna have to give this a thumbs down so
everywhere I did there was a lot of
these costumes did actually prove me
wrong and I did like a lot of them on
there was something that done the
company obviously and I really disliked
so let me know down in the comments what
once you like once you give a thumbs up
and what won't you give a thumbs down on
or so and if
then just find any of these things again
that i wallet them down below but yeah
search eBay give it a go and let me know
if you ever bought anything from eBay
before and if it has actually look like
the question that you order because some
of these did some of them have better
but some of them looked a lot worse let
me know down in the comments below what
are you going to be dressing up as this
Halloween I'm thinking about buyers so
yeah let me know down below and if you
