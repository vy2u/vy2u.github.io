channel now for this video as summer is
here and you guys seem to be loving my
eBay videos recently I thought why not
combine the two and try it on summer
party dresses from eBay and that's the
Amazon as well
now some art is amazing it for me is
like the best time ever and I just like
love going to festivals or having fun
but the annoying thing is if you always
need something new to wear like
everywhere you go and the problem is I
never seem to have money in the summer
and I thought a lot of you guys can
relate to this if you can limit you let
me know down in the comments but because
of that reason I thought why not try on
some dresses from eBay and Amazon only
under 10 pounds to really all these
dresses all going to be bargains I'm
really really really hoping they don't
disappoint I don't think they will if I
can get one wear out of them then that's
absolutely great and I love it but they
might not look like the pictures wanna
see the pictures they looked amazing so
fingers crossed and open they do and I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you do even please much a like and
also subscribe to down below if you guys
have already
oh and also make sure you switch on that
about next to the subscribe button
because then you get notified every
single time that I do upload well
without further ado I love you going and
right now let's get in to the video so
I'm going to start with whatever dress
is in this bag now I vote daily movement
open it justice check like it's a good
like I order like different types of
dresses so to check it before the party
dress but I haven't actually bring it up
today so I'm pretty excited now I might
even insert for this footage of what it
does it like online and now it's
actually seeing what it doesn't like out
from the bag
terracotta sterile good now this dress
is a little bit different I thought I
would kind of like to venture out my
concert so I thought this is a little
bit cool and also in like wow those
dresses that you can either like dress
up or dress down so if it does look good
then I would get a little wear of it
because I can wear it when it's going on
the evening like right out in a day so
I'm very excited to try this on and give
you my thoughts
okay so first thoughts on this dress
well I'm thinking if it doesn't look
good on me it could look go mine and if
I'm going to shower with my now would
even why this it looks very oh like it
looks like an old granny like yeah
little more Molly that I was expecting
it to be not really the cool
I was going for also going to say the
fabric is quite thin however I just say
two colors I like pretty much like
immaculate to what I saw online so I'm
quite happy about that I'm not sure this
gonna tie on and then it's going to give
it a go I'm really hoping I can pull it
off this is a fail
now this dress here without my comfort
zone and now is the reason for that it
is staying out of my comfort zone
because I am not feeling this
I so I feel like fifty years older for
starters other words it's not me the
fabric actually all right the colors
will write the dress over we just tell
them that like what to do online it was
a lot like tighter online and it just I
don't know if I can just remove it like
this so to really like this one I'm
going to have to give a sale can I just
say as well as on camera and she looks
so much better that it doesn't realize
what can be actually wearing this you
would not think it looks good but
there's like where it's upside from
behind as well and then the front so
this next one is what I think it is I
think you imagine my favorite of all of
them
I obviously again don't worry accidents
like this is definitely more but of
going out dressed as I was really
pressing or I think white life is bad so
far so that also has a new chart so
images again fabric is completely
different if they all kind of like silky
I get some really really thin material
it doesn't look see-through which is
quite good though so obviously this is
more of a dressy dress so that's why it
kind of has like this place on the top
here which I really like I think you
look very pretty and it also it has the
light lace on the bottom as well so I do
think this dress is actually really
pretty I'm just really not sure on the
fabric because it does still super super
super thin how do you actually really
like this but to me looks more like a
night dress like a little most sexy like
lingerie like I would have to probably
wear this to bed because this the fabric
actually feels so nice I like silky I
thought I was going to be very
unflattering so drive super tight but
I'd really like it I just don't know if
it really does like the cocktail dress
that stars look online
I am absolutely loving is so so pretty
definitely my favorite of all of them so
far so I get fits the occasion more than
any of the others is that this does
actually they're like my little cocktail
dress
this next dress having no idea what this
dress is it is don't even remember
ordering this okay so this is some sort
of like denim looking dress all it just
requires one big piece of fabric there's
like no hardly like any sign to the
dress trying to find the top okay so
this is the top of the dress it just
kind of looks like a really like my pfff
t-shirt and then it's got these here
which I'll get supply to the pout that
you can try out and probably make it to
a nice bow or something and think if I
pull this quite tight it could look kind
of cool there's not really much to say
about this but don't even remember
ordering it but I Revere's one of these
things are definitely bought a plot
there once it's on this is one that just
doesn't look very go in camera but like
in real life actually looks really good
now
this right here I actually in love with
you definitely were seen you wearing it
I really think it's very trendy it
moment kind of like how Heidi kind of
this with that corset look really really
like on trend like on tops and white
dresses at the moment so think is really
nice however I must say it's very short
at the back so as a back you go by you
can see ocean yes so it's really short
it's little longer at the front than it
into the back by a variety is a really
pretty dress and it never got just a big
piece of like material like I do have a
number on that's pretty good and I'm
pulling it off or you know like it now
this next dress again I'm gonna pop up
the picture of this one okay this is
more right oh okay so a transport on
this Drive I'm actually really really
liking it now obviously the bath rate
isn't going to be quite what you at
expectancy and like a Topshop or like a
misguided because obviously it's so much
cheaper but only people the money I
actually do this dress will look really
really pretty on and I do think is very
pretty dress I'm all sure what it's
gonna like will shout like waves in
Washington it's got like a lot of holes
in it and again is braced in but it does
look really nice and I can definitely
imagine
self-awareness was like a nice pair of
heels or everything like if you're
already stylish but if you wear like a
nice pair of sandals this dress has
altered it really nice like if you is
going to a barbecue or something like
that so yeah I know I'm excited to try
this one on too so under you see this
dress also so pretty however it is so so
so see-through you definitely need to
wear like a white bikini underneath dead
our chicken be a bridesmaid so that's
more you can see through this dress and
probably should change but I just want
to show you guys healthy through this
dress like actually is I don't think
might enjoy and what best of them start
the schools and if I'm pretty but the
fabrics are actually pretty nice on and
enjoy till you have this dress egg roll
and to be honest like I don't know I
think it's a I don't know because I get
so some perspective that good so I think
it is another success now on a line this
one's definitely my fake one just
because I'm so upset anything like
tropical country and just summer in
general is a different aesthetic if you
like that solid vibe so I'm excited to
see land oh the fabric actually this to
be honest Department on this dress was a
lot nicer than all the other dresses
that I'd like hide in my hands there's a
keynote top decent you know I think this
could look all right I'm not sure how
flattering that will be but I do think
it's very pretty and do think it looks
kind of nice like again I think another
really nice of white sandals and make
sure that nice appeals as well but it's
not really much to it it's just a
palm-tree kind of like slow shift dress
and I don't really think can go wrong so
if it did look like awful in real life
like I don't know how but yeah it pretty
much looks the most similar to the
pictures I've been on it so it seems to
appear on has taken only really faithful
to things about it I actually love it
when she believes it I enjoy a good part
for Kentucky's
kind of it comes a little bit so one
that kind of I've ionising healthy
strength very cute I definitely think
this dress was a success
okay last but not least god knows what
happens because I've done this before
I ordered a small from eBay and again
they've given me a medium so I have no
idea what this feels like
but I have a feeling it's good way
should be okay I'm really glad I just
didn't get a small even though I did
small booklet it doesn't even look like
it's going over my butt chief it's so
short however I don't know it because
they from bin like it hangs really
really low so on sizing wise I have no
idea what things are going to look like
on but the fabric looks like I mean the
fabric some rights a little dress
as you really like the back and we like
the detailing I think it's very pretty
and yet I could give it a go let's go
try this on as I said I get a little bit
too big and I definitely think they're
smaller than better but I've already
read write the dress it also great see
through but the back actually is so so
pretty this is the type of the dress the
lace detailing duction really really
pretty energy it's really nice I mean
would you be it doesn't actually fit me
like it's not very tight here but
overall I do think this is pretty but
the fuzzy is just awful so full 159
active in this dress is really really
good it's actually a quite good quality
as well the only thing is it's a bit
more cream in real life or like online
it's like so sort of white but like
overall yeah this was another success
what everyone if that is the end of the
video I hope you all enjoyed if you did
you know exactly what to do go as such a
big thumbs up also let me know it down
in the comments what you prefer but what
do you think with more of a success

from eBay and Amazon before and I've
