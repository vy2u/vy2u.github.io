okay let's actually get into unboxing
I'm so excited
can I just really say you guys know how
much I'm obsessive packaging as well not
only is everything about this range like
actually beautiful and obviously I
designed it myself so it spray it down
good but the packaging is like amazing
and I'm such a sucker for packaging and
I know you guys are going to love this I
do have a couple of favorites I'll tell
you my favorites this is probably one of
my favorite things packaging why is
because it is so cute so
the first thing guys this is kind of
like what everything looks like with the
heart and the eyelashes you guys know my
obsession with eyelashes how much I love
them I wear a pair of 40s pretty much
every single day you know when I started
this in January I thought okay what is
one thing that relates to you so much
and also first thing that came to mind
this is the first thing these are 12
pounds and these are the pajamas
obviously it has like rose gold
eyelashes on the front and then on this
one it looks like on the back as well so
it's so cute and then you kind of open
it up like a little mini wardrobe they
don't show you the pajamas here so then
you open it up oh my god is just this is
what it looks like so obviously you can
see a sneak kind of like preview of the
pajamas in here now I'm gonna open it up
which is so I can show you guys what it
actually looks like pulling them out
like little mini water now I know some
people from my daily vlogs have seen the
pajama bottoms because you saw me
wearing them I just couldn't resist it's
been so hard to keep this a secret this
is what the top looks like I just
thought this bit was so like relatable
where it says off line because I feel
like I'm on line all the time that when
I'm asleep it's the only time when I am
off line this is what it looks like
overall and then it does actually the
tags are so cute as well so they have
like when it was signature the satin B
little tag and then it says by Safran
Barker on the back which I also thought
was like a little special touch that is
what the top looks like and I will be
wearing every single night I'm just so
glad I could tell you so I can actually
use my own product because I've been
wanting it all on my bed for the longest
time but I just haven't been out next up
guys is the pajama bottoms so obviously
this is in the same set and this is what
they look like I love love love the
style of these I love how they're like
tighter at the bottom I just think they
are the comfiest pajamas and also they
look so good as well because I know some
pajamas like whenever you leave some
baggy they don't always look the best
and they're not that flattering but
these on the other hand they are so good
Oh yerin or so they don't roll up in the
night so let's go up next to know what
to go for on the subject of a bedtime
I've got some really cute like stocking
fillers and some really cute things that
would go with the pajamas here
the hot-water bottle is so cute and when
I say it's like soft it's the smokiest
thing oh my goodness I I just I'm gonna
use this all the time we're just so
excited and obviously it has the love
heart and the offline logo in the middle
as well and then the tags it just so
pretty obviously it has like my
signature on the rose gold as well I
just love everything about it so that's
a hot-water bottle then some other cute
stocking fillers is these eye masks we
had to get to because when we were
deciding I just I didn't know which one
I loved more so we just decided to bring
both of them out I can always apply post
all over social media and white pictures
wearing these and if you grab them be
sure to tweet me your pics as well okay
so I think this is definitely one of my
favorite I mean I have a lot of
favorites but I've got my very own
snuggly like what the Frick like this is
so cool I don't really know how to
describe it if you haven't seen it on me
before but it's like a mini
dressing-gown that's so much more
comfortable so much easier to put on and
you can throw it over anything so just
put it okay I'm gonna put it on over my
jumper right now because I just need to
show you guys this so obviously it's
kind of like poncho style the hood is so
cute I love the eyelashes when it goes
over like how cute is that and it's just
so cuddly I love like these little
bubbles on the end as well and then it
has like a massive like giant pocket
that says offline or so and I just think
you're so cute and this is what it looks
like so yeah oh my god I'm gonna wear I
have been wearing this every night and
people been seeing like by the top of my
blog so like it's a snuggly stuffer
bringing out our own one so to everybody
that guess that yes you were so right
next up is it this travel pillow which
I'm obsessing over because you guys
don't know that I love to travel and I
do travel quite a bit and also it's a
memory foam so it's like the comfiest
thing so this trouble pillow I will be
using a lot especially like with my eye
mask I have one eye mask bed one for
when I'm traveling it's amazing so yeah
I would definitely get a lot of yourself
this as well it's just so so so comfy or
even if like you're not flying somewhere
it's even good like if we're just in the
car or on the train like I know I use
these like quite often in the car so now
I've got my very own at her sacrum vodka
one pretty damn good so next up is that
this little Marga which i think is what
he's not really that little it's
actually quite a big mug
see I want to say is I love the shape
and my auntie came round this morning
and the first thing she said to me as
well as I love the shape of this mark
cuz when wheels first kind of like going
through it all it was like a different
shape mark and I was like no like I'm
really not feeling that and then we came
up with this style mark and I just feel
like it's so nice it's like the perfect
way to hold like I don't know it's just
like you I just really like the shape of
the mug I know it's kind of strange but
that's like a big deal to me and you can
get a lot in this also so it's really
nice it's like white inside as well I
will be using this a lot especially now
we're coming towards Christmas hot
chocolate oh yeah and then kind of
moving on to like a room at deck or so
we bought this which i think is so cute
so this is a white board is that not the
cutest white board you have ever seen in
your entire life obviously you can hang
it up as well like on your wall which is
definitely what I'm gonna do and then
obviously it comes with a little pen as
well this inside missile is Safi be
packaging which i think is so cute but
on the back as well it's so nice because
it has my signature again in rose gold
and then it says by Sarah Barker so also
I think this is actually like the cutest
thing ever
and it's six pounds like that is so good
I really like this I'm definitely gonna
write because I think it says to do then
brackets later I move it I'm gonna write
like a lot of my video ideas and stuff
and I put this on my wall I thought it's
gonna be very very very handy so there's
that and then also one of my favorite
other things in the in the range I asked
for something very similar to this for
Christmas last year and I did get the
one that I wanted but it's just so like
it's just plastic and it falls over a
lot and I think gets really dirty
because the color of it and I know so
many people ask me about it so I thought
why not do my own version of it where I
can actually have it in my room and it
can look pretty rather than one that's
very dirty and cheap and just breaks and
I don't want to put it in my bedroom so
I came up with this stand-up LED light
which is amazing and it's like every
person's dream so this is what the
mirror looks like I'm ready for it so
obviously like reflecting on my camera
and on my life but it's so pretty it's
like a light pink and then it has like
it's kind of a glittery and it's really
really really pretty
obviously it has like the little boo boo
LED lights going around which is like
that's my dream like I love
so much and also the attention to detail
on this whole product is amazing because
how like the stuffy beyond the back and
then also like even where it stands up
it has like this tiny little love heart
and you might not mean a lot to some
people but this for me it's just so cute
and I love this on the product I just
really think it finishes it all off so
again this is so affordable and I just
love it and this is one thing I know for
a fact I will be using this every single
day you can have this we're just really
cute it's like a make is a quarter a
make up pot but you can also post
stationary in it you can put your
brushes in this it's just like a really
handy pot but I think will look really
cute on anybody's desk and I just really
like it I really like the fact that it
says it just wing it
I just really like that quiet so yeah
you can put your brushes inside but then
also you can put is actually stationary
so of course I have my own stationary
out and look on Cuba's little penis it's
one home 50 and it's just the cutest
thing ever
I am loving this ball ball hands up if
you lose your pen so easily because I do
however you will not be losing this I
mean there's probably a way that I
probably still could but you guys will
not be losing this because it's very
obvious and it's like the cutest thing
ever
so I wish like I was out of school just
so I could use his pen and put it in my
pencil case but then also I will note
pad which is so cute and it said spot on
the front which I just thought was
really cool and then it's just quite
simple inside it just like lying paper
where you just write your notes and
stuff and I just think it's very cute
so yeah that's like for stationery oh my
god I love it so much
oh so this is this really cute secret
hot pillow I love the color gold so much
but I also do love the kind of silver so
you can literally go like this brush up
and the eyelashes are still on the
silver and on the gold so you can have
this either way I think I offer be more
like the habit gold on my bed you guys
know how much I just love fairy lights
in general obviously so I've got my own
fairy lights which is so cool so these
are five pounds or which is not as a
little try me button and like you can
see the micro light up which I just
think is so clear and a little la parts
I just throw that you could get any
cuter again I think this will look so
pretty on anybody's bed but also you can
put it like across - or you can hang it
up or you can put it like
Romero you can bet using so many
different paces and I just think it's
gonna look cute wherever you put these
so yeah I love that I also love the
whole packaging on this as well so there
are my lights and then we've got more
we've got so much more you guys know
that I love to take Polaroids so we
thought the idea of having like a little
picture holder you can really clip
anything onto these I will probably clip
my Polaroids on these but you can put
like no pictures or notes I really like
this one over see it's like a little lip
and it's so cute and then we have one
that says squad so everything as you can
see all it goes together and then oh
this one's so cute as well I love this
one so much and then this little one
here it's like a thumbs up I really like
the gold on the bottom though I just
think that's very pretty so that's the
picture holders and then we've got
another cushion as you can see this is
very different to this cushion
they're very different styles this goes
so nicely with the bedding somebody's
knocking at the door I actually really
like the back and the front of this know
I would have though this is the front of
I would also put it on my bed like this
because I just think it's so cute and
they are still gonna go like so nicely
together so yeah this is pretty much
what the cushion that's like I really
like it again I really like the colors
and we had the squad logo garments
pillow I thought it's pretty cool as
well and I really like the piping around
the edge as well I think it just really
adds adds up something to the pillow
okay well I say we're getting close but
we are literally at the end so the very
last thing from my very own at Primark
Grange is the duvet cover so I have
actually got a king-sized duvet like on
my bed because I always have a
king-sized duvet so I'm gonna put this
on my bed and show you guys the whole
look now so with the click of my fingers
let's take a look at everything on my
bed and what my bedroom is actually
gonna look like so everyone here it is
