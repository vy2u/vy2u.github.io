station and I'm making for Jordan I
don't know if there she is
do you better say hey to the ball
this is like amazing team
the fighting on the train had to wait so
like la so no our train got delayed
long train of what time those advances
because it's meant to come attend to and
then it said it was going to come at six
and then we've got an earlier one I like
22
so it was nothing for that I don't know
why I was I would have been letting the
man came to train ticket and also a
train ticket so we got pretty scared
because obviously like I don't know what
we would've done but it doesn't like the
find us or something and like we went to
go ahead and I train to give you their
life whose order is Roy just cause he
stopped making it so we was walking
again finally on the stranger-man to
actually walk with almost a short one

got on the earlier train
turns out our train has no boys it done
what's the double you've had to get off
it my turn it's terminating so we have
to swap and get on in London Victoria
temperatures in like two minutes
so and it's so another thing is we get
walking too powerful for which I've no
see whether in aggravation well then

to walk a little think I'm more drinking
