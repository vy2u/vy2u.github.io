tell us to try them right right I don't
buzzing for this I need your product
outside I never have coffee but I'm
gonna be off the walls after this by the
end of this video we are going to be
like hyper out of hell I think I thought
we already wearing the right clothes in
there I don't know
Starbuck society truth if we're going to
eat the working star bar you cannot be
doing with this camera I think we should
change up a little bit way less well we
already took me feel so much better so
much better I'm ready to try the many to
do this video now I'm ready for this
video I knew this video time you'll
enjoy this video if you give us a big

they don't seem so hot behind the scenes
over on my blog channel to go click up
down now or down below always link down
below I'm an alternative video over an
area channel to go throughout as well
but as well how I do let's get into the
little is the first drink what is this
this is the roses recipe I actually love
roses Australian solids are drawn I'll
make it happen even jog along right this
guy strongly saw some stuff inside so
I'm going to try it
23 straws right today look say I think I
will cream clover side it will clean
this part of my head earlier as well
about I don't know how hang of it is
acti actually I'm going to say just a
video to say to the video that is one of
the best routes i think i'm kim yoomi
ever tried so he's not going to get like
it into the home right in step in out of
10
okay now petals away that was a
strawberry chocolate monkey
like that but it's legit does yeah well
that is soda water rating I'm going for
a a Python I try to eat so good well
thank you
hey Matt for this one is the cookie
dough yeah I'm excited to try this
longer I'm in all cookie dough ready
three two oh that's good
isn't it extremely tasty that's Brady
drop ye can only turn on a single net
see I rate that higher than the road
this one will make higher but it is
really good it's really strong which I
really like about it I think I April
time Matt was coming all the words like
well yeah I'm giving air not wonderful
your precise yes we have got a name for
the big one the big one you will be
buzzing on I will actually be off the
Lord - I think we should finish the
drink even though I'm probably gonna
hate yeah but we did you go
yes I'm kind of not your poisonous do it
anywhere but this is this is liquid
cocaine
it's expressional and white not
considerate with white more conservative
the most had too much sugar in of all
the 0 yeah if you know milk littering
nothing else so I will be optimal here
is these bacon one is exactly the
smallest one of every single cup that
we've got but here is liquid cocaine
no surprise are we're gonna try
understand if I can the truck not Street
come on guys we even tell them what is
ice ready 3 2 1
no I love an active oil document or dick
the bed washer Alex poster on always a
so drawn for I know I select even though
we're not even burning I feel like butt
he's nobody nice that he's so strong I
feel like I'm going to go crazy I really
know again you really like yeah not
really good you like this dress you
might miss yes how lovely them Oh guys
this is not how you were going to be of
those mechana can you cope with coffee
okay everybody someone why'd you give
that look good don't go oh you're giving
so much me I know I completed in yeah
why are you crying I don't know I think
what is it and it's actually got his
design right now remember do you can try
oh this one looks good this is clearly
Oreo to adjust them you let it ring do
you like that
that is so good that is really good now
as you don't like Horace hey done wait
yes wait wait my off the tape I don't
need you guys video okay I don't know if
you taste that the audio crumples in it
but I do like even think it tastes
really similar to the cookie dough one
yeah I think I'm Spartacus you know one
thing what I'll do yeah 7.5 go for an 8
winning at the moment we've got the
roses the cookie dough is definitely
better than the Oreo however they are
recent but by very tasty tribal
I've been effective yeah right the next
thing I do is a little bit different
obviously it's a hot drink so it has to
be in a different container
so this looks like a weak hot chocolate
but apparently it's a nut tumor that's
an adrenal gonorrhea that's what are you
really shouldn't be drinking any more
caffeine in it if it has to this
yes minute really now sits like a viral
what 203 grab me or not fellas oh is it
why is it gonna telling it got no no
terror inside inside probably peed in
hot chocolate and then like Trouble Man
in the Yukon thread on the ring and then
nipped me like lettuce I got hot water
put mud in it yeah pretty much a
suburban algorithm you're not really not
nice if you choose between there and
I've got chocolate death let's go for
chocolate or completed horrible and it
has nothing to do another so why they
don't know better might even standard
also on the Starbucks secret menu
there's also a drink called pink drink
yes blue and I'm like how and why forget
there's a tube going above water so
idiot
we are on our last drink this one I
think was the first when we originally
chose we wanted to do this is more yes I
love more
I don't miniskirt it's not mellow at all
no I mean it looks really when you
compare it to all the other drinking you
try it looks like really strong
chocolate some typing if I were talking
on it I should love this on spot ready
Rebecca I'm sorry teddy I'm not too sure
grin I'm not used to white I do not
enjoy that personally oh I like that you
really yeah it's a true although I
didn't take those laws I thought if it
pumpkin good I be that way lovely I can
try oh yes pumpkin a little bit more the
after day but I think that I don't need
I'm gonna give this big I'm giving that
a great yes three yeah oh you win there
make it I think I like it
like hmm when you compare it to the
other one to insult it's like all cool
but when you compare it to some of the
ones that we tried yeah I mean I really
like the muddy hot chocolate they are
the mighty hot chocolate
