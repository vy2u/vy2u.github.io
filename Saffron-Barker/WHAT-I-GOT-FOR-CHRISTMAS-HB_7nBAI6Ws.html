in other clubs you get in using my name
hi guys so today I'm going to be showing
you all I got for Christmas this year
now this is a highly requested video
everyone's been asking me to do this and
I'm so certain it means I get to look
over all of my things that I got
yesterday again so I'm so so so so so so
excited to do this video I just wanted
to say I'm so grateful about everything
I've got like honestly yesterday I was
overwhelmed I'm still overwhelmed by how
many things I've got I was so spoiled
and honestly I'm so grateful so thank
you to everyone who made my Christmas my
family and my friends it means so much
to me and I've got some pretty amazing
stuff so let's get straight into the
video now in my sack if you saw my blogs
videos how to stock it that's my faith
if you saw my vlogs we don't have
stockings we have sacks in my house and
this is one of the first thing I bought
now this is a cosmetic organizer now
honestly I have wanted one of these for
so long but it's one of the things I
haven't bought myself
it exists more this looks like it has to
like tiny bits in size and too long does
it and this is plastic and I just wanted
one of these for so long actually
original into the lipstick one but this
one's great so I can just not put
lipsticks in erisa that makeup in it but
as well I did actually get our makeup
one as well which is in this box here
which was also from Santa in my sack
this is what this one at t8 has two
sections so here's four loads of
lipsticks and then you leash you can
just put those and other light useful
thing in and honestly I'm so grateful to
have bought this because it's one of
them things I've wanted for so long but
I've never just gone out and bought
myself as you'd have to order online and
twist I'm not a fan of ordering online
this is great and it is so handy to have
okay so I'm going to go straight in with
my main present and
honestly I'm so happy to a party I'm so
so so so grateful and this is a MacBook
Pro now I've never been happier when I
receive this let appears towards its the
best thing I could ever receive I wanted
it for Christmas more than anything I
was not expecting it and I'm so grateful
now as well all of you guys may know I
needed a MacBook Pro so badly because I
was showing my mom's to edit all of my
videos before anyone final cut but her
laptop is so slow as so oh like it took
forever it's a carp an hour to turn on
the laptop and I promise you're
hydrating for everything to load up it
took half an hour and I think it was an
unwed mom just as much as it was
annoying me because I was using her
laptop and she can never get on it so
yeah I'm so lucky to have this and I
think my mum's so glad that I have my
own one now as well and I also got this
case from Christmas as well which I love
although a lot of people did think this
was cracked when I put it on my snapchat
story total my friend what happened your
laptop was a guys that's just like a bar
war vet or you won about my laptop has
not cracked this is the laptop case I
actually love inside my laptop I have to
- now stickers and I actually also these
as well and I got these from Santa so
I'm grateful so thank you so much mom
and I our peaceful open app is open look
I get that Gregor okay I got this from
Santa and it says it's going to be a
rainbow unicorn kind of day and if you
watch my videos a lot you'll know that I
love unicorns and I just love this car I
think it's so cute
and the fact that it has a swirly swirly
straw inside is just
yeah and I love another thing I got from
Santa and I'm also in love with I'm in
love with everything that I got is this
scarf now I have one very very similar
that's like a darker brown and it's
crappy also and I just think these girls
can make any outfit that we could like I
was saying to my mom the other day look
at my outfit mom and then look what I've
got on my fluffy scarf she's like oh my
god just look so much play with it I was
like oh no oh so I'm so happy to have
this it's very light to my other one
just a different color and yeah I love
this Thank You Santa
I also got another scarf Santa just
knows me too well this is also in my
sack this is just really really nice as
well it's not fluffy it's just like a
torch and effect and I really like it I
really just love the colors on their
white I'll I'll put the red I just think
it goes so nice and it's so useful now
we're in the room now this is something
I didn't ask for but if I saw these I
would have asked for these these are
amazing now here at some bands that I
got but these are what these look like
they have a gold tip which I just think
is out including to call my life here I
think these are amazing and you will see
me wearing these probably in all my
photos now they like to set these that I
like 600 pounds and these are probably
about 50 pounds so oh my goodness I love
them so much I love the color of them
and I believe you can get in the black
as well which I think I might have to
purchase these are amazing and I'm so
happy I've got them thank you mom for
choosing these for me you chose e
perfect shoes myself
I literally if I could design a shoe I
think I would design it to look like
this from my best friend Georgia this is
one of the present she got me and this
is a best friend brownie mix and
basically I love brownies so much and in
one of my gift guide videos no it wasn't
a gift guide video what video was there
I think it was like a making Christmas
gift or something I said this is an
amazing thing to do because I just think
it looks so nice and then it's you can
maintain great out of it thank you
George
love this as I have to sit in one of my
videos I guess and that's where you got
it from I'm not sure especially his best
friend on it I just think it's pretty
clear yeah I'm definitely going to be
making brownies guys and then from
Nicole and her family I've got a surplus
key bracelet which is so beautiful and
my mum put in a different color as well
and if I can just get it out and this is
like a light blue just amazing bracelet
basically I think this is incredible and
as soon as I finish this video I'm
definitely going to be putting this on
I'm so grateful for this this is so a
protein and I just love it I love the
fact that it's there as well because I
think it kind of matches my eye color
yes but thank you so much there's
something I've been asking for for ages
from Blue Avenue and I'm so grateful for
this present because it's a present that
I thought my mum would have forgot about
because I told her about it quite a
while back but I want to do so badly as
this is this amazing dressing gown that
I'm just too in love with okay so it's
his pale pink fluffy dressing down
eleven-year and I wanted it so so much
it's because I have a dressing-gown but
it's so dirty now I've had it for like
three years and then they're going to a
Christmas like two years ago and it's a
long dressing gown and I really really
wanted a short one as no one's really
tend to annoy me I just think this is
just so pretty
and not just that as well when I tried
it on in the shop it's the fluffier
thing I've like ever tried in my life
and it's amazing so I'm so grateful for
this especially as I did think my mom
would have forgot about this it's like
one of the things I was not expecting to
go on Christmas Day and I'm so happy
like that today no for my idea everybody
knows I love bath and Bodyworks I have
got the marshmallow pumpkin latte shower
gel and body spray and also this my
favorite thing in Bath and Body Works
and I originally asked her to get me
handle a while back
in America and she got that for me and
then she surprised me with these or
Christmas don't I'm so happy and
grateful for because I ran out of this
rope just so sad and Twitter's I've
never had the shower gel but now I think
I'm going to be setting better than
another thing I've been wandering for a
very long time but still just haven't
gone and got it myself is a plastic
boost cup I don't know I just want it in
my house because I love this so much
I've always wanted it and Casey Nicole

sipping on my strawberries and cream

think I would wear them already but in
the evening don't go out in these as
much as I love them and these are from

stretchy and so I love these a lot and
Otto

his tasks in a smile maybe I should try
some it now I didn't get the transmitter

thought the other day when I was in
London and showed my moms like oh my
goodness how nice assess and Nicole when
I got one and now I've got one and the
next thing I got was from my mum and dad
