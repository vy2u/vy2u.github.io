you guys have already a let's get into
the video
what so sighs so the first thing I woke
up tour that I kind of wish my favorite
president but I'm just gonna hold it up
a little bit so the first thing I got
when I work with my birthday I got a
nice little knock at the door and really
like I woke up why does Zed and I was a
knock on the door and I mean you know
the box is going to expand iam to use
and showing me now but I did get a whole
box of Krispy Kremes no more laughter I
promise you I didn't eat the water
myself but to be fair I think I probably
eaten myself in white since I would
update when back the whole weekend
because I'm healthy when there's Chris
McLean doughnut it just doesn't matter
like you stole out the calories these
are my favorite throwing on a bus and
thank you so much creams for
sending me these because they have run
down a ferry to myself on a whole family
I've been loving life ever since these
have been in the house yes love you
gotta get to the gym but maybe that was
obsessing to wake up to my belch I was
like okay I've been awake for 10 minutes
and already going amazing and what can
get that upset over my friends my
parents
oh my goodness I'm so so so grateful Fat
Joe wall I wasn't no share my favorite
kind of stuff I'm just gonna go for it
so so you're certain things of this
actual park the bus wrapped up because
obviously my mom General Sherman issue
shipping so opens like this there wasn't
a virus or the douche bag which is such
a pretty bad by the way I'm kind of
freaking out because I do choose one of
my favorite designers ever and obviously
and I hope it's quite pricey and stuff
and I wouldn't I just didn't expect to
get angry fine then I remembered there's
something that I've been watching from
Gucci for the longest time but you can't
get in the UK so still I was like are
probably probably might be those
obviously it's going amazing and it was
exactly what I wanted I then opened it
up to see this shoe box which goes so
pretty as a
my flowers and it's asking to it thank
you and then I actually saw my Gucci
sliders now I have been want to need
forever their Gucci and supreme because
it's a collaboration that they've done
my parents actually bought these from as
Baker's their friend was out there at
the time when she brought them back so
my mom was not very sure that she could
get them run off so she did and here
they are in my hands right now and I
wore them all day oh my god day I've
worn them all morning and honestly like
I hated taking them off my feet because
I love them so much and yeah and so like
still I'm so excited about these and so
so grateful it's II did not expect them
at all so that's like one of my life
mein presents from my parents so yeah
couldn't be happier very very very happy
girl and then also actually this is like
smoke set remain present from my parents
simple the other thing that I did
actually really really really want I
think it was little Aziza I think I'm
seeing any thoughts I saw it or it might
have been no yeah it was me wrong when I
went to New York my momma my auntie the
beginning of the year I went to Michael
Kors and I feel is really pretty
bracelet and I was like I bought this
bracelet so much too then I find out by
the way if you don't have Fitbit is then
you'll know what is basically a Fitbit
watch is a watch that basically counsel
steps in the day and like how many steps
you should do and I calories and stuff
like that so those of you know as a
healthy lifestyle kind of like what it's
like to Rotten saw this Michael
collaborator and I was almost in his
mind some another bit to then find out
it does the same the fit they're like
you can enter an app and it counter
steps and calories and stuff like that
so it is beautiful bracelet like black
rubber around here then obviously it has
the yellow gold and then the kind of
like an white diamond see face I just
think so so pretty and I love the yellow
gold as well actually so yellow gold
rose gold nigga so nice so nice you
don't have a turn one I've everyone is
really pretty bracelet at the same time
will be a cantor my steps
feeling fit I know it will make me want
to walk more for that bottle I want to
do it for like yes like two and one so
I'm very very very grateful that I did
get this as well so thank you so much
mama does with that I'm going to go into
work support on my birthday so if you
borrow my golden channel or anywhere
maybe a hobby I've got some pictures
right now this is what I want to move up
in me and I go it's on my mom and dad on
my birthday and they're kind of like
backs it up and like tissue paper on
inside a box every frickin visit
basically so it's this as I crossed it
over bottom shortly wrong so it's kind
of like Beijing will be too it has a
custom a Mingo and then hopefully from
the front it's very good for a topical
body suit but it's a bit more laid-back
not so in-your-face because it's more
about nude and my face colors so this is
really nice prestretching really comfy
make it actually get from Topshop for
anybody went wandering and then also at
that and the same vodka mum got me leave
those shots are really nice that
obviously has the ropes out going up off
the fun I'd be pretty pretty please
class into a boat and the shorts like
tires from the bottom and the reason my
mom got done it is because every single
life larger Christmas my mom also said
my parents my mom goes out and gets the
clothes she always buys me an outfit to
wear for my birthday or for Christmas
Day I hope you got something I look
forward to the most is the fact that
like I get to wake up I know I'm going
to have certain eyes outfit you sorted
for the day it's just brilliant
so I did what I felt on my birthday
evening my mum and I have a very similar
fashion taste okay probably almost a
success for my mom so I'm very very very
happy with that so that might be why I
wore a birthday and I've also got my
parents now let's go get my mom and dad
was this misty or perfume it might
actually favorite perfume of all time if
it's the one could opened it up and mum
I still want sure it's the one that I
had like basically I had a missed your
curfew ages ago to quickly shorten it
and it was amazing everybody loved it I
loved it and I never found it again my
mom thinks it's this one but we're not
certain I'm not gonna open it until I
definitely notice one it's very
thoughtful of them and I can't wait to
actually smell it and see if it is the
one but also with mr. your parking and
then if I don't mean I don't get my
parents was its denim back here that it
has got makeup on it because it's white
and I've been wearing it a lot as well
it has those look like hearts and
eclipse going down the back which is
what I absolutely love about it I think
it's so cool I feel like image any other
look good but I'm always in joking but
obviously I'm just wearing a white
backdrop right now wait look what I do
see you guys
look everything by concept clamp that
and then this is kind of like we looks
like on I can get on anything in at
three corner alum it's all pretty cool
when we do keep sliders you know feeling
good so this is also a jacket got my
parents and didn't get from Topshop as
well so loving Topshop actually saying
that so that was everything to my
parents from a mine and random a nanny
vendors that you more see in my blog so
they've got me which I'm so obsessive
cherries no be eaten cherries but like
anything cherry wise I qualify from
clothing I seem to fall in love with and
then sounds pretty weird by own it's so
many items of clothing that has chose on
it and is obsessed so my name is and
I've got me this cherry off the shoulder
top it's so cute I love what the frills
gonna cross here is quite sure obviously
it's a crop top and it's so pretty and
again they do have to get it from
Topshop yeah this is for my Nana fun dad
I love it so cute
most people put my hat like white and
brave like cherry van I just think to
get up I'm weak stop in here my god oh
my god
oh my goodness okay I just think
together they're gonna look really cute
and I'm very I haven't had to answer
whereas yet so I'm pretty excited now I
do have to get back in money as well and
so I go to the bathroom I need for my a
burning burger and I aren't even uncles
and stuff so I went shopping action on
my birthday and I bought some bits for
myself so I'm just going to show you
them because I going out my birthday
money is the first thing I've got my
birthday money is inside this box here
this is like a lover I hate thing I am
so upset so I just thought just doing it
because the hubbub in my son why not I
got these bands today they're so cute so
I haven't even seen the TV shows because
it's an old TV show but they are these
Snoopy bands they are pale pink
they are so sipping - I mean a very
babyish Osama our wing it was like a
real on them they're very baby but I
help them pull out way yet and I thought
I'm going at them so I did
so they are just the baby pink nipple
and bands a bunch Snoopy on it
that I really like slightly how about
those are different like regular parts
like on the shoe and stuff I just think
you look through to a low road and
Wireless love pink and I just love tip
on band in general because their own G
pairs and I pretty much wear them every
single day so I would get a lot of wear
out of these so that's always for my
birthday money on without knowing my
brother and this whole got me shoe for
my birthday because basically they gave
me my birthday present at the end of the
day and the rest of the family gave you
my presents beginning of the day so I
already went there for clothes before
knowing what they bought me it was a
different type of shoes where is it here
now I've got three new shoes and nowhere
to put them
from Casey you Nicole they've got me
these really lovely gray suede converse
I'm so obsessive converse because
they're always going to be fashionable
cool I feel like they're always
fashionable they're always going to look
cool so there are these grey converse
about the hot iron here that has a go
light pink strip going down the back
this will be a really pretty recall and
again I probably get a lot of wear of
them tricks because they're converse as
well and it's pretty mustard everything
so that's also what I got from tasty a
Nicole now I'm going to go across you
know there's one other thing always show
you wait one sec you see if I think I
got my birthday money so I've got from
River Island now it's good this is going
to offer them camel you need to just
imagine it it's like slag thousands of
Indians I rent is like with this like
white desktop or even just like a white
crop so I'll back up or anything with it
authorities have it really nice
they're like orange titles at the top
and they're going to express there's a
bright bright orange I've got them from
River Island but I think they're not
really class the automatic skills and
stuff I think that looks so nice and I
very dressy in the evening and something
a bit different as well so I don't
really have anything like this in my
wardrobe so I bought this up my birthday
money and it was quite pricey that those
42 pounds Pacific was very expensive so
I hope they do look very good on credit
try them on but it's hard to tell that
obviously if our Hills then the final
thing I got my birthday that I bought
myself was well a MacGuffin money was
this green top again from River Island I
said I think it's the disco about it I
think it's blonde higher and it means
happiness
and French if I'm pronouncing it wrong
but please let me know down in the
comments but that's the final thing that
I got for my first day and I actually
bought that for myself so you guys
probably would have seen like some bits
in my box and stuff
