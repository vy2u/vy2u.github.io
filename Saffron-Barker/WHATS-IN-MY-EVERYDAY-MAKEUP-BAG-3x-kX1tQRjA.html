channel so today I am filming what is
inside my everyday makeup bag last week
if this video goes up the week after
last exactly any expense I don't know
last week I filmed what's in my backpack
so I think this is going out the week
after
if not I filmed it the weekend after and
it's gone up another time but you guys
requested what to my everyday makeup bag
and I'm just so excited to do this video
because let's just say I love love love
talking about my makeup then my friends
and I we always always always over my
makeup and on this channel I don't
really do many makeup related videos I
don't know that's something you guys
want me to start doing like more makeup
videos just in general or just a sick of
what I do and to do whatever you guys
request that way
I guarantee definitely though wanna film
my lipstick collection that's not all of
my lipstick collection that's all of it
but I really really want to film that
and you guys really want to see that so
that definitely will be coming too oh
and there is one more thing I wanted to
say as well why do you feel about this
backdrop background kind of thing I
don't know it's kind of weird because
I'm never ever like up close
most the time I'm like quite far away
when I film so it's kind of weird just
being in a new backdrop not just in my
bed I don't think that would be a
regular thing if you like this that drop
then also let me know in the comments
below so whose are you gonna stop
rambling on now because I've been
talking for god knows how long now so
let's actually get into this video what
it is my everyday makeup bag this is
actually from a source those of you who
follow my vlog channel always ask
someone where's it from
could you see this every single morning
it's from ASOS so I'm gonna link it in
the description but and it was 12 pounds
I love it because it's just so adorable
let's open it up I'm going to kind of
put my random Bible try and do like face
products first and then go with like
brushes after lashes are fake
the first thing I put up my makeup bag
is this two-phase Prime and oh my
goodness I love it so much it's a new
addition to my makeup as to be honest I
never used to wear primer I just don't
really feel it was needed but then when
I tried this one here I was like yes
this is so the money why didn't I think
of getting a primer before so I can't
really say it's the best plan ever
because I haven't really tried many
primers but I do know that this works
and the packaging is adorable
so it just makes me love it so much more
and next in the bag is my foundation
just want to point out before I like
properly properly start even though I've
been like talking for like seven minutes
right now I don't necessarily I can't
say that word I always say Saren I don't
know what I say
I just might think I said I know I
didn't think I do and use mostly
products every single day but this is a
bag that I take out everywhere with me I
do my makeup eyes everywhere doesn't
mean I'll go to top up every single day
it's just in case of emergencies are
always from a makeup bag so there is
quite a lot of things in that for
agencies for my foundation I use a bare
minerals compact foundation in the shade
are 250 I've been using it for years and
I still have it now this is amazing the
reason I love this so much is because
one is so easy to apply to it hardly
ever runs out like there's so much in
here
seriously every time I do it it never
seems to go do never seems to go down so
it lasts a very very long time
third and final thing the reason I
didn't use primer is because this
foundation stays on your face for the
whole day I've tried using liquid
foundation just because I thought or
maybe there be a bit quicker I put them
on my face it's fine for the first hour
after an hour every single nickel
foundation I use it goes back to I don't
know what type of skin I've got is not
necessarily dry or oily I just think
it's kind of normal but I just can't put
liquid on my skin without a just going
patches so this is like the best
foundation ever I'm so glad I started
out using this after I've done my
foundation I go on and use the
Maybelline
an anti aid the IRS are never I had a
concealer like it down Lee recommend you
to go get it is $7.99 so it's not like
that expensive
I love at the wash of it so much it just
feels so nice on your skin and I get the
shade light and I put this all over this
isn't like a concealer to cover up
sports I personally do things regular
that I personally think is really really
good to contour with so use this on
daily the brushes that I have on today
and I take him at everyday makeup bag is
this one by kiko called blending wave
and it's a multicolored flush no I
didn't actually go out and originally
buy this it was my mom who went and
bought this then I ran out of Russia and
I was like no what we're going to do so
I asked for my mom's and she has this
one by Kiko it's a really really nice
blush it's not too strong I've got it on
today as you can tell I think I just
said that yeah I did
I have no idea how much this is I'm
gonna link everything in the description
below so you can find out all I know is
it's a really really good product and I
seem to be loving Kiko products on the
moment Camille chubby stick I absolutely
adore this product so much I don't own
anything else from their brand I only
own the chubby sticks I also own the
chubby stick in the lighter shade
personally I don't rate it but this one
here is amazing this is a long curvy
contour I love it so much I seem to wear
it like every well I do wear every day
and I'm not person to like proper
contour my face when loads of makeup
every day for like when I go to school
you can make this so subtle and you can
also make it so dark at the same time
okay so so good I have the Mac Studio
Fix NW 25 now I don't use this as a
foundation and now it's a foundation I
don't use it as a foundation I use it to
blend the makeup in for my face to my
neck because I love wearing a foundation
color this is actually darker than my
skin shade that bone marrows is darker
than my skin shade so I use this to rub
it in and it is amazing and sometimes I
do bond my neck but this is a really
good powder and I think if I didn't use
bare minerals I would use this
although bare metal is so much better
for your skin than this I know a lot of
people that write this ant upon us I
don't really write many of my products
apart from
it six then it's like so like my
favorite thing ever they are like heaven
how many veni other products are there
apart from this scar I use the
Maybelline New York mascara it's quite a
clumpy mascara as you can tell I always
have like kind of clumpy full eyelashes
I love that look I think I'm just used
to them being like jet-black and full
and thick so this definitely does the
job on the thickness of the round the
six pounds the other day I literally was
in heaven because urban decay so me some
of their products and I tried then you
ought to go highlighter in the shade or
eight hour it was a highlighter that oh
my goodness I'm in love with a Mary Lou
highlighter you would have heard me talk
about this so many times in my vlogs and
in my main channel videos it's so
pigmented it comes out exactly what it
looks like my biggest compliment that I
always get on YouTube is oh my goodness
your highlight or something to do my
highlight or down to this it's amazing I
love the packaging it's just like so 60s
and it's so like Marilyn Monroe and
highlighter itself is amazing as well
did you guys just see my dad because I
did obviously go get this I'm telling
you now it will change your life
eyebrows I use this week I bought
palette I use every single day it's
really really good it comes with judo
brushes one angle brush and one rounded
brush powder and then the liquid after
shade light 8:17 also in my bag I have
this nyx concealer HD what show do I
have it in I think it's just a one I
think it's called I can't really say too
much about this I haven't had it long I
think I got it yesterday but I put it in
my bag because I've been looking for
concealers that Kim he's thin enough to
go over the top of my eyebrows and
underneath to make sure the eyebrows are
more like sharpened because that
Maybelline one there isn't a thin brush
with this is more of like a thinner
brush these are the brushes that I take
out every single day
now these definitely aren't my nicest
brushes mine Isis brushes of ones that I
use when I go out I don't want them to
yes coffee in my makeup bag so honestly
I have way nicer brushes than these but
these do the job they can get sloppy
it doesn't matter they get dirty so I'm
going to talk you through them
yeah they're gonna be ready with dirty
there's foundation brush here from Real
Techniques it's really really good
but for new to put my thumb in the eye
it's too thin to be a foundation brush
in my opinion and I use powder anyway so
I don't really like using foundation
brushes like these so I use this for my
concealer to go up here and there and
tap it all in rather than a Beauty
Blender
Valenza all in I use this big powder
brush here from nan Chi and then I also
use a big powder brush from Real
Techniques it's also really good isn't
it my everyday makeup bag that I took
out though because is far too being like
this such big brush but it is really
really good there's no brush here I've
used for contouring and I also use for
highlight I prefer to use for highlight
it's just so nice it's so soft as well
why am i demonstrating another row
technique is brush I use this buffing
brush as a blusher brush
girls why found it module thought why
not use it works really really well as a
blusher brush I also take this I didn't
know that this is called conceal
Perfector I use it for highlighter as
well and just to go around the edges of
my face I love this brushes so much this
is also from lunching yeah lipsticks my
favorite part of the whole day every day
I take out velvet heady I think most of
you guys will know this it's from Mac
and I think it's like 15 pounds it's bro
use now but if my go-to lipstick it
matches with everything it's just such
an amazing Halle
be doubly from NYX I also use it's very
very similar to velvet Eddy again a nice
dog neutral nude color finally this one
is also kinda similar it's on to online
prime and this is in the shade bleached
it is the most incredible color yes so
that is everything is on my makeup are
my makeup bag is completely empty and I
officially have nothing else to talk
about
