video
we're savvy oh yeah you see
hello everybody welcome back to my
channel so today I'm filming a very
requested video and this is what's on my
iPhone I have no idea why but it's been
very very impressive and when you see my
phone in a minute you're going to
realize how I'll organize my phone is
and I am as a person and if you watch my
vlogs and stuff you'll see how messy my
room is and how it is like an untidy
person I am when you see my phone you're
going to realize that even more I have
like four folders but all the rest just
mumbled on board and just yeah so anyway
let's go straight into the video before
my screen so I was very sexy on it
I would unlock whiskey and normally have
a screen saver but let's just open it
shut this is my screen saver and it's a
picture of Jake and I one is at center
parks then I unlock and I have four
folders as you can see I have game
extras health and photography I actually
only made two of the folders because two
of them actually came with the iPhone
and that's health an extra although I
did add two apps to that put that like
it right so the first folder I have is
the games but I only have one game just
because I never really play games like
if I want my phone and more me on social
media but I found this game out and I am
now addicted and so is the rest of my
family especially my brother and this is
called best fiends I really recommend
you guys get it it's so much fun
I'll show you how you play it now and
I'll spank you okay also okay so as you
can see I'm a level 11 which some people
might not think that great because I'm
really not good at the game with
everybody try I just can't get past
level 11 which is really annoying that I
scrolled up because this game you can
connect with Facebook and stuff you can
see other friends in the world and my
brother is part where I'm trying to go
out right now I think he's all like
level 13 for something like that myself
and my family are just in like
massive competition on this game which
is actually so much fun so my goal of
the game is to defeat six slugs and
thirty flowers so how you do this is you
have to connect all the matching
pictures and then they like explode and
hit the slug and then will calm down and
you have to try and get as many you can
can as possible and as you can see on
this level I only have 23 moves so I
have to defeat six slabs in this time so
if I go across here others 30 and then
as you can tell those more contact and
you can't go diagonal which I think
score as well so I can go down to these
mushrooms and get four there there you
go so as you can tell it the more you
get the harder it hits the slug oh my
goodness is loads of yellow ones oh oh
yeah also as well because I have two
creatures as you can see that it will
Greenleaf one and the yellow flower line
that means they can attack harder on the
slug so it's better for myself to get
the green ones and the flowers because I
have it all characters of them oh yes
much isn't quite good I have to beat it
free and so twelve moves that although
this one's really cool because if you
get this like five arrows in healer then
more calm
see this is why I'm so bad anyway I'm
making itself really complicated
honestly if you download the game is
really not that complicated and it's
brilliant if she's gonna quickly show my
team as well I'm sorry right so this is
the temple
he's one level three and he's just
adorable and it's gotta cost my flower
one and it's in fact even cuter that's a
good thing that's why I don't know
pronounce it there's like thank you
and then making your team becomes like
the easier is on the game because
they're better at meat in the slugs yeah
it's just so much fun I just really like
it so I'll put the link in the
description below and you can also get
Android as well just my dad doesn't have
an iPhone he plays it a lot of hybrid an
Android moving on I'm gonna go to
photography because why not I probably
should do an order right so as you can
see here is my social media my snapchat
my Facebook Instagram this little thing
here you're probably wondering what is
it
link me to my life subscriber count' or
by a blogging channel and i'm neon 39000
which is so exciting and the support I
get my channel is amazing so
thank you so much to everyone describes
do it and if you haven't already I'm
also going to link that below to go
check this out which are YouTube this is
like an app studio it's an app for few
tubers that people that have channels
it's just like to house your statistics
I've cannot say the work for you or what
about and your analytics and stuff my
facebook Messenger my email my music
Ally I'm empty this is like my new
favorite app I just love it so much just
so much fun pin dress hallo chat but I
usual tryna I'll talk about in a minute
my insta track so basically because I
have a K or my Instagram I can't see
exactly how many photos I've got where
they've I go on this app it tells them
that I had exactly or wanted
project ace ages too low 1117 thousand
six hundred six whenever I wear my
Instagram I want to know Mel ready then
I have afterload which is my favorite
editing app and I use it all the time
and unload of you always ask for how I
edit my pictures so I just a little bit
about that so say I went on to
afterlight click on the first pitch and
this in my album that isn't even my
picture and it already has been edited
lows such a brawl is a comedy edit this
picture so much because it already is
very bright but I always brighten my
pictures and put a lot of saturation on
them so what I would normally do is
increase the brightness by like 50%
although this picture has been writing a
lot so I'm only going to take it to like
30 something percent then so saturation
which is a little drop here is my
favorite thing to use ever like I had
even put effects on my Instagram post
but if I do I'll show you what I use for
that also based on actually on Instagram
like as you can tell
no I brightened the picture it makes it
look so much better what I think so
anyway so look here's before and here's
after and there's a big difference when
my Instagram was like this kind of theme
I always uses one effect and this is my
favorite BEC to use so good mmm Aidan
it's just a really nice effect I don't
add too much to it but it kind of gives
it like a perfect of that the other
thing that I've always got artists how
do I put white borders on my pictures
and I always use a square right or guy
this is just this collage app in it you
can see the colorful squares I think it
slipped you just on and a go photo
collage is cool so click on there out of
my photo hoop know how much you want to
it so I'll do panic quite bit about
there then you can move your picture
when it's inside as well it just makes
your theme is so much better when you do
this I think so anyway so it's a really
really good way to add your Instagram
pictures and it's how I always edit mine
interest I love Pinterest I have an
account but I don't really go on it much
like I don't really add things to my
walls I just look on it like if I just
want to see like inspiring stuff really
other people's accounts or like
sometimes I don't know ideas of how to
decorate my room that day or I don't
know something special coming up like
good ideas to great stuff and yeah just
a really really cool app musically so
they're not the best it but I loved it
and I felt so cool the other day because
I only had York one day and I got
featured and I had no idea how it
everyone's like commenting on my
Instagram you got features I'll teach it
I wrote only download the app my
favorite app on social media right now
is Twitter just because it's such an
amazing way to into out of you guys like
I get to DM a lot of you all the time
and I have group chats and staff and I
just love talking to you on there so
March it's just such a good way to be
able to talk to all of you so if you
have twitter make sure you're following
me so we can have a nice little chat on
there a lot of extras that is my you now
and my life subscribe red card again
this is my main channel not really
particularly going or drop this so I'm
just gonna go like throw it up my
favorite apps and stuff and as if he
like you just see currently when I'm
working on my phone
add some core and Swart fit which a lot
of you probably won't recognize and
these are apps I use when I'm at the gym
a lot of you are like what are booties
and stuff I do and this app is such a
great app it's called awesome cool and I
normally go on absolutely awesome and
I'll just click on there and you're
basically you choose your workout you
can add your normal music from your
phone and it looks like 10 minutes of
your ab work and basically it just
twines your ab workout and gives you the
ideas and tell you like routine to do it
it's a supreme bicep also this is a
great exercise
already actually now this one count you
down for 30 seconds and then you can
just change it and it has those
different app exercises and if you don't
like one either you can also change it
and it won't take down with time like
steam engine I never knew that either so
great app also and then the one next to
it is just a light version of it that I
probably shouldn't delete yogi does the
same thing they're both free but it's
just another fitness app I'm using at
the moment and there's just like casual
calories or foods that you eat and self
and lock it all in and then like when
you use something bad's as well if you
just log every single thing that you eat
you like feel bad next day because you
know they can to not put them I leave it
back in it here are its no just about
like counting the calories and news and
weight and self I just want to be like a
healthier person and healthier person in
myself and I just feel as it this app is
really great for thinking about the
choices you make fast Twitter that's
just like another app just like find and
follow which is a way better version the
fast Twitter so I would definitely go
that one
there's just basically tells you that
uses that like do follow you back and
stuff I had at ages ago I don't know I
have it anymore
puppet 365 ago I haven't users in ages I
downloaded this so long ago like a
novelty yeah I haven't used it in ages
like a cool app you can add like fake
hair himself but also if you have like a
massive pimple you can link it and stuff
maybe I should start using it more
probably would be a good idea numbers I
haven't used it in ages so HSBC is just
the bag that I use and it's just way
better having it online right so now
it's emotional button ballsy and this is
an online shopping app and this is great
because it has over 150 high street
brands which is so good we should be
just search it and there's a brand that
you want there's designer or whatever
it's just so much easier than
like our by something or just going
individually and going onto every online
shop actually how it works say I chose
what I don't know I'm just leave their
addresses
Sarab really really wanted something
with the brand idea I will click on
Annie - and it will show me loads
different items from a DDoS and you can
just scroll across or don't you Joe live
and which one should do you like like
this just scroll across and say I really
wanted these shoes click the thumbs up
and it will go up to my saved items but
what's great about it is because Sadie's
went on the sale which a lot of times
they do a more Z it will send you a drop
notification like dinking and there you
go is in the sale on it lets you know as
soon as it's in the sale and you can
just go ahead and buy it
get yourself a bargain and also is so
quick this app like it takes you two
seconds to purchase something like it's
so much quicker than any other shopping
apps are eyes like news before
personally I'm gonna lick every single
thing that I use at all my social media
every app that I have will all be linked
below so make sure you go check them all
out and this more Z will also be linked
we're going to talk about Netflix which
is what everybody has necklace is
amazing although I don't even really
have time to watch TV that much anymore
but when I do watch something on Netflix
is always going to be a series because I
just love getting into serious and it's
area that I love is PLL is so amazing
and prison break as well although I do
really want to get into another series
soon and what's the one that everyone's
talked about in moment he is making a
murderer that seems so good so I think I
want to try that out but if you guys
have any other series that you think is
really cool or interesting whatever or
good to watch then let me know for that
as well star box I have the Starbucks
app I don't know how but like my mom
gets some courage and Starbucks
sometimes so it's just really easy to
have the app books I just show the code
on the app and then it just like scans
it through and get my hot dog
every pose isn't a prize and let's
schedule my tweets if you know I'm out
in the cinema whatever like I'm going to
the cinema later say my video is going
off I couldn't we take that my service
then every post will do that for me
which is gray chromecast this is a
really cool thing
it basically connects my phone to my
teeth even out a lead so like a little
box you buy it's not even expensive
quality well I don't think it is for
what it does it's thirty pounds and it
connects the phone to your TV and you
don't just have to work Netflix as well
you can watch like YouTube videos or
like anything on your phone so it's
really cool where size is another app
where you can just put all doesn't start
but once again I don't think this as
good as photo collage a conejito
I had this because people was tweeting
to me I always will forget do so I just
wanted to guess myself but it was so
cool train line I find it so much easier
to have the app on my phone but they do
get trains quite a lot and it's so much
easier just to see the live times
himself and like I always travel updates
quite a lot on the train so it is a
really good way to have live times etc
and it's really good way to booking as
well really really good way for booking
over this is start to go up I never use
it to like what I'll be to go with my
friends I'm a gigantic girl picked off
you my friends in at the updates really
good it's like Skype I find it so much
better because it's so much quicker and
you can do it on your phone I think you
can just go up in your phone as well but
the connection so bad but it was me when
I had it and I just is just really cool
like you can have up to like five people
on it I think we may have more I'm not
sure it's just really cool as well
because you can add like effects and I
made myself read a friend made us our
pub or my friend made herself green and
like you can add my little cartoons and
it also plays for me and it's like any
random and Issaquah OMG i nearly forgot
about such an important thing to me and
that is my music if i'm honest before
actually start although
you absolutely love this music and
mainly listen to it through YouTube on
my laptop so I don't have too many
albums on here but an album I absolutely
do love to bit is it Justin Bieber's new
album purpose it's amazing my favorite
song when it's love yourself oh this is
amazing if you haven't heard least check
this out this is one toward me I want
you to warmly mashup and this is by
auntie Kate and she's not like a really
famous singer but you may have seen her
be on Facebook it was viral it was her
in the car like singing tardy goodbye
austin mahone it's like a song jake and
i absolutely love it's like our song i
don't know it's just always been awesome
so there's that absolute favorite album
of all time is Destiny's Child

been living they are the best go band

unfortunately they aren't together
