channel I hope you're doing good I hope

are in the world right now today as I'm
filming this is so sunny and beautiful
outside and literally I have like well I
don't really have the best view it's
pretty much of my by Gardens but it's so
sunny and I'm just being like such a
good mood today so it's all good
I hope ever you guys are in the world
it's nice and sunny and hot and you're
catching a tan unless you don't like to
sudden you want it to be cold then yeah
but I love I love the Sun so I even got
like a a palm tree top on with a palm
tree pillow in the background
absolutely brilliant anyways I'm going
to give me today and today I'm going to
be doing a Q&amp;amp;A for you all
I always can be indecisive on this
videos or my I don't know like basically
I go requested to do Q&amp;amp;A so so so much
if we do like these videos then please
rush a like and subscribe down below and
then also let me know down in the
comments if you want to see more Q&amp;amp;A in
the future as well let's give it a go
and let's get in to the video are you
seeing anyone - speaking to anyone at
the moment
no I'm not like sorry to break you guys
I don't know I guess I'm quite picky
like I just I can't seem to find
somebody that I really like and also I
don't want to just do something like if
I don't really like them and I think I
want somebody that's so similar to me
and that's really really hard to find so
I'm glad just like I'm waiting our way
from the perfect person just to just
walk into my life I don't know when the
day's going to be but I hope pretty soon
but if not fine like living single life
okay this question oh my goodness okay
when I saw this I was like does
pineapple belong on pizza yes
pineapple visa is the best pizza I don't
understand
it's like pineapple how can you not like
it on pizza if you don't like pineapple
pizza please leave why did you get your
first boyfriend now
I think my first like boyfriend my
active or that's my house I think I was
14 yeah zhenia nine I got my voice right
beginning or end what is your favorite
moment okay I have to bury song okay
this is the bass one so kinto a sailor's
alma mater afternoon personal way I'm
going to get you to the chorus Daedalus
basically I love pretty girl bye Maggie
Linderman it's such a good song
literally I felt like I heard it before
it went in the chart I started listening
to it as a nature like a week later it's
in the tracks I was like yes they know I
also have one other favorite song and
again you guys really like saffron so
it's pretty Mars that's what I like
favorite girl effect I love this song I
love Bruno Mars so much as well what
sort of music do you listen to
now my favorite type of music to listen
to is like R&amp;amp;B pop so I loved by
Destiny's Child TLC like them though but
they're kind of like my favorite and
they're more like R&amp;amp;B and I also like to
play general and pop music like I love
Gina Gomez and Justin Bieber's so yeah
they're pretty much my favorite do you
miss being at school not necessarily
just the education aspect but the social
aspect tune I see my friends even when
I'm outside of school obviously not as
smart as when I was in school but I
still get to see my friend and when I
was at school I didn't enjoy lunch I
didn't enjoy break time I didn't enjoy
the social aspect like obviously I like
with my friends and stuff but I just
thought like I've ever doing so much
better things right now and if I want to
hang out my friends like I can do that
somewhere else like I don't have to do
in school I didn't like it for the
educational side there and I don't
really like it for the social side
either so to be completely honest no I
don't really miss school by the way if
it looks like I'm sweating I am but as I
said it is so pulsing where do you see
yourself in five to ten years time now
this question actually makes me really
happy because my dream in 5 to 10 years
time would to be to have a boyfriend
maybe engaged yeah over like engaged
yeah maybe really like marry
and our vehicle so maybe like be
prepared like anyone to like our last
kid I want to move to America I want to
be in America basically creating a
family and hopefully I'm hoping that my
youtube would have just got bigger and
bigger and there will have been more and
more of you guys which will be amazing
and then I think also I would love to be
on TV so I don't know that presenting or
acting but that's something I've always
wanted to do like my entire lifetime so
I'm hoping my YouTube kind of gone into
something like that that is I'd love to
see myself in five years time so
basically with a family on TV and happy
pretty much what is your favorite
Netflix series oh my goodness I'm dying
to say this Vampire Diaries if you watch
my channel you will know I'm
fully obsessed I've watched about seven
seasons and I think just over a month
and there's 22 episodes in each season
it is unbelievable and trust me when I
say that because the name I think the
name ruins it that's the thing like it
sounds so babyish it's just so good like
I thought it was going to be kind of
like Twilight and Twilight it's not
really my thing so when I first like
heard about it I was like mm I don't
know and I was really like holding it
off but then eventually I watched it and
it's like the best thing I've ever done
so going on to that question Zac Efron
or Ian oh my goodness okay so Ian
basically is daymond from Vampire
Diaries and then obviously you guys
probably know Zac Efron I've always said
it's a Karen is like my dream crush and
he is like he is so perfect like he is
my definition of perfect however after
watching Vampire Diaries in is like the
most beautiful person it's his little if
you don't watch it you will know his
little like his smirk but at the same
time I know like Ian and Nina are really
happy if we don't watch Vampire Diaries
and so sorry for you with this
I know Ian and Nina are both so happy
like Ian's married he's having a kid but
I would do any
for Ian and me not to be together
because I just feel like they're just
like a match made in heaven so I
probably watching Zach because I want
those two to be together but if not you
if you want a youtuber what job would
you like to do I think about what
they're doing YouTube I will probably be
looking into an eye care hostfest as I
love traveling I really want to travel
the world in the future if not as there
may be an interior designer I do not be
really difficult though and you have to
study I think it's like a seven years
course so I don't really know how I
would go about that but I love like
designing things when I got to recently
redecorate my romo that was so much fun
just like shopping and finally bit so I
don't know that would be pretty cool as
well are you planning on going back into
education in the future and other videos
thank you so much and I can be honest no
like I'm not really planning at the
moment or going back into it because I
don't really feel like I necessarily
need to I'm going to be doing like a
couple of courses to do with what I'm
doing right now so I want to do a course
on photography I want to do a Photoshop
course so there is like still courses I
want to go and do but going like
actually back to college or some things
that isn't really something I want to do
and another question I do get asked as
well is how come you didn't go to
college now I just hated school in
general so the second I knew that I
didn't have to go to college I was like
okay well I'm going to focus on what I
want to do because when I know that I
was failing science and I didn't want to
be there like all I was be thinking was
I could be making a youtube video I
could be doing this I could be doing
that and those other things that I
wanted to do so when I knew I could get
out College and welcome from that I
loved obviously I want hands down that
opportunity and I think as well if my
you if YouTube kid go downhill then I
can always go back into education and
that's always going to be there so I saw
I'm just going to live the moment and
just do what I love right now so that's
pretty much what I have done and so far
is going well how many boyfriends have
you had
I'm pretty sure I've had three
boyfriends okay this question was what
is your favorite eyeshadow pen at the
moment so my favorite I should have had
it all time is the modern renascence
palette and
er it is absolutely unbelievable it's so
pigmented but then one of my favorite
palette actually at the moment is the
Tudor beauty palette because again the
colors are really pigmented the shimmers
everybody raves about but they aren't
really my I don't submit really that
amazing to be on it they look really
pretty but they're not that amazing but
the kind of like basic block colors
they're really pigmented and really nice
so that's probably one of my faves to do
the first vlogs or main channel now
personally if I'm watching a video I
definitely prefer to watch a blog I
think I've just really knows that I like
just like watching people's lives I just
think that's really good fun so I prefer
to watch flaws I used to prefer filming
vlogs now it's kind of like I don't know
I don't know it's hulk's there might be
a month or like I have so many goujian's
my main channels I'm like oh my god like
I sort of get loads of main channel
videos out and then there might be some
other time so I'm going away and I'm a
holiday and I'm having the best time
so I love blogging it so it's kind of
like a mix I don't know but if I had to
choose probably vlogging yeah blogs my
fav dude you like better
Stefan or Daymond Daymond do you want
kids and if so how many by the way love
you loads love you too lofty I actually
want three kids when I'm older I think
maybe I saw like a lot of people on the
same amount as they do sibling okay so
like you for a single child you only
really want one kid like obviously I
notice are always like that but I feel
like majority of the time that is the
case and I have two brothers so I feel
like I don't know I've kind of grown up
being 3 of us but I want three kids and
I think I won two girls and one boy
I want twins I really want to win but I
don't think it's going to happen because
maybe and my family has twins but like I
want to win so bad why does Jen know
like being on camera when you're filming
now Jed is just super camera shy he just
does pretty much it there's no
explanation he's just camera shy my hair
it's driving me insane
the car is so sweaty
have you ever met another youtuber who
was nothing like they are on camera yes
I think I met like five or six youtubers
who are nothing like they are on camera
and honestly it's so frustrating because
I wish you guys could know but at the
same time I just couldn't tell you like
it's just yeah I just couldn't tell you
I wish I could and I wish you would know
so if you want to like I see people
tweeting them and I'm like if only you
knew
but yeah as I say much else would you
ever date a fan now I'm not just going
to straight-up say no obviously not
anybody that watches my videos so yeah
of course I go with definitely date like
a few ideas have because why not like
it's just somebody that enjoys my videos
and if they made videos I'm sure I would
enjoy them as well so I yeah I probably
say hands up yeah as long as it's not
like too obsessive then yet do you want
any tattoos in the future now I
definitely do I kind of want like small
ones I think one on the back of my neck
would be really nice I also think like
on my wrists here will be really nice my
favorite way to get a tattoo would
either be on my ankle or like on the
side of my finger and it will be so nice
think if I'm going to get my first
tattoo it's going to either be on my
ankle or my finger so I do I do want a
couple but like small ones and I have no
idea yet because I want them to actually
be like meaningful and that's something
I won't regret getting in the future
what is your biggest fear and will you
ever face it now I think one day I'm
going to have to face my biggest big my
biggest fear is actually dying now a lot
of people won't really understand this
and I drove me understanding myself but
sometimes when I go to sleep at night I
can't sit for hours on end
because I get scared that I'm going and
I know that sounds so crazy and so weird
but it's just one of my biggest fear I
don't want to die and I don't like the
feeling of not knowing what it's going
to be like I don't know even though I I
don't know like yeah me favorite bars
it's so confusing I confuse myself but
that is my biggest fear I am sweating so
much
so I'm going to end this Q&amp;amp;A here
no.13 the questions quite quickly I
don't know if you guys did but if you
got this far I hope you guys enjoyed the
vid anyway so that is the end of the
video I hope you all enjoyed if you want
