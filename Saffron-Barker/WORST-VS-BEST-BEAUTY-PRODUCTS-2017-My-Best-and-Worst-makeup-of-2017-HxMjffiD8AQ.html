and welcome back to my channel now I
hope you guys are having a fab start to
2018 I know I've said this like a
thousand times but I literally can't
believe how fast 2017 went is so crazy
but you know why I'm having a good Sox
2018 and so far and I hope you guys are
as well I hope you're having such an
amazing start now 2017 it was definitely
full of a lot of priors for me but also
some really big lows as well but we got
past that so the same up with beauty
products and makeup my darts I found
some products that I really flipping
love and don't think I can ever live
without and I also found some products
that I definitely could live without and
never want to use again so in today's
video I'm gonna be letting you guys know
exactly that my favorite and my works
who you put out of 2017 if you guys
enjoy this video as much a big thumbs up
and subscribe down below and without
further ado let's get into it right so I
do want to start off with the worst
products to kind of get the negativity
out the way get the positivity for 2018
so we can end on a high note
so we are gonna start with the worst
product I know everybody hates
disclaimers but if I don't do one
everyone's gonna hate me for not doing
one just to clear things up I have
absolutely nothing against any of these
brands like I love the brands but just
these same products didn't work for me
or I just did like them for whatever
reason it maybe they work for you that's
fine I'm really happy for you but just
personally for me it's bit of a bummer
and I wouldn't use again now the first
product that I want to talk about and
know so many of you are gonna be like
what I just didn't really get the rave
about this product this is the essenti
beauty of highlighter no I lips feel
authentic beauty I've tried their
foundations I've tried the quanto sticks
all of its been amazing it's just this
for me just wasn't that great it's not
that it's like the worst product in the
entire world but I would never choose
this over any other highlighter that I
own this is what it looks like you've
got two different highlighters you've
got more of a metallic one and then
you've put more of like a softer
highlighter
now on your finger it looks really
pigmented but on my skin I just didn't
really find that very well and whole
honestly it's meant to be a highlight
for me it's more like a low light so it
just didn't really sit on my skin very
well I didn't really get much of a glow
and I just feel like it's really
expensive definitely one of my worst
products over 2017 it would be the
iconic a London foundation stick now I
do really like foundation sticks
personally this one didn't work for me
again I love the brand by the way if you
don't want to watch the word she can't
just skip halfway and you know what's
the favorites I just kind of felt like
it was a bit drying and it was really
hard to blend now I don't particularly
have dry skin I would have what you call
normal skin like it's not oily it's not
dry it's just kind of like in the middle
but this foundation stick I just felt
like was a lot of effort like more
effort than needed like honestly it
would take me so so so long to trend in
I try using a Beauty Blender and I also
did try using like a foundation step
like a buffing brush and nothing was
really working and also I felt like it
came off really quickly as well but like
in certain patches like it never really
came off evenly even when it came off
now actually this actually has to be my
very worst product of 2017 these are the
liquid chrome highlights drops by a
Barry M Barrie em what were you thinking
I mean personally I think I should stick
to the nail varnish I love the nail
varnishes I love other products that
they do but these honestly are a no-go
no I got sent these to my PO Box and I
remember on my vlog Channel I was like
thighs and look look at these look like
they're really affordable they're way
cheaper than the iconic I'm liquid
highlight drops so if they work they're
gonna be amazing but they just didn't
work it's really kind of sad you know
what they do like I put them on my skin
and I feel like it's just removing my
makeup like my makeup ends up going so
patchy because when I put this on and I
Debit am like with a Beauty Blender it
will remove the makeup that I have on
underneath so it kind of defeats the
object and your makeup ends up looking
actually worse so for me this is just a
no-go and my iconic they kind of started
the highlight drop trend I think don't
hold a grudge against me on that I'm not
particularly sure I know the iconic
color drops and lips
amazing I feel like bury em try to outdo
them in it it just kind of failed so not
really feeling their notes product I
know again so many people are gonna be
like suffer on what the heck now this
didn't actually launch in I mean in my
oh I don't know this launch in 2017 it
might be end of 2016 I'm not
particularly sure but this is the naked
3 Urban Decay palette now I flippin love
naked palettes well I love naked Winer
naked - and I love Urban Decay but this
palette for me just didn't really work
but I love the packaging I love will it
look like but I just feel like for the
price of it you could get a way better
planet like morphe do palettes very
similar shades to this it has way more
than a lot more pigmented I just feel
like these shades in here aren't bright
pigmented now I know it's a little bit
harder because they're kind of more like
pale colors and rosy pink colors so I
know it is harder to get that pigman but
I just I don't know I just don't really
think it's anything special and I
definitely wouldn't go out and buy it
again for everyone so there was my worst
products of 2017 and we're gonna move on
to my favorites I've got a little bit
more when it comes to favorites
I literally just couldn't choose I feel
like a 20-17 was definitely the year of
makeup they came out to such great
makeup like Fanta Beauty flippin love it
just didn't like that highlight anyways
so the first thing I want to talk about
is the Tarte es Pro palette obviously
this is by Tarte really new product that
I found towards the end of 2017 but
honestly I find myself reaching out to
it more and more he literally is amazing
so I know if you guys follow my blogging
channel then you want to see me use this
practically every single day I love it
so this is what it looks like inside now
I'm not exactly sure how much this is
but it's got 12 different matte shades
it's got four metallic kind of like
glittery shades I just think the shades
are so so so pigmented like I mean crazy
pigment
and also I just love the variety of
change you've got in there like there's
a big variety but they all kind of still
go they're not just really random so
like I use this palette and I won't have
to use another palette like I find with
a lot of palettes I love it they're
amazing it might be really pigmented but
I have to use another palette as well to
get a color that will blend really
nicely with the color I'm using my god
that was a long mouth for one day
okay I love this palette is amazing if
you can get your hands on it definitely
go and pick it up no I know you can't
actually get taught in the UK which
sauron side but you can actually order
off support now they do UK shipping so
if you have a place this is a four order
you know what's ordinal because this
baby is the best thing you will ever try
I am living and I mean living for the
Marc Jacobs foundation this is is this
the remarkable foundation yes it is it's
full coverage I mean a very full
coverage ridiculously full coverage of
anything I mean when I'm wearing this
you don't see a single pimple on my face
no I know you can now and I'm not
wearing this because it's actually
completely run out it's pretty sad I'm
gonna have the place a Sephora lab that
actually you can get this in the UK you
can get it from
I think it's Harrods maybe it's John
Lewis one other two can get this in the
UK so I definitely need to go out and
buy some more the foundation that I'm
wearing right now is it's not very good
I do I've run out of my favs all the
face I'm going to show you but this is
amazing if you love a full coverage
foundation this is the one for you if
you don't definitely do not get this
foundation because honestly as much as
it's amazing it's so full coverage that
like if you put too much on you will lit
unit like you painted your face like you
can't use much of this which I guess is
a good thing like if you like for
coverage it's really great it lasts a
long time anyways I love that and I used
the shade of beige tape
I've got two more foundations I've been
loving so I only recently decided using
this because I feel like I kind of just
went straight to high end I didn't
really use much drugstore stuff because
I saw so many people raving about like
amazing high-end stuff I thought ochres
drugstore stuff is way cheaper it can't
be as good but I was so wrong because
the L'Oreal Paris true match foundation
is literally amazing now this show that
I'm holding up is actually kind of too
light for me so I definitely do need to
get a darker shade hence why I couldn't
use it today but this is really good
it's super blendable as it does say on
the front package it's really easy to
blend it lasts a long time it gives such
a lovely finish like it isn't too matte
or drying it's kind of like a bit it's
kind of a glowy without being oily I
finally just really sits well on my face
and also they do so many different
shades as well so if you're looking for
more of an affordable foundation this is
definitely one to go and pick up and
then at my last foundation I'm sorry I
just cannot talk about this is the NARS
sheer glow foundation now this is kind
of in the middle of those two
now it's full coverage but not full
coverage as Marc Jacobs and a little bit
more full coverage than the in L'Oreal
Paris foundation this is just so great
no I feel like I made me love this
because the shade of it like matches so
perfect to my skin so I've got these
shade stromboli sheer glow so it's
medium free I just find when I wear this
it looks so good again it lasts for so
so long and I find that like a lot of
makeup can sit on top of this product
and it kind of won't be won't move my
favorite lip gloss is hands down or the
Anasazi art Beverly Hale course is I've
got toffee on right now which is my
favorite shade so this one here is
toffee then this is my other favorite
shade called butterscotch
so toffee oversea is the shade that I'm
wearing right now it's kind of like a
toffee caramel color and then a
butterscotch is basically just a little
bit lighter than this firstly I just
love the stick I feel like it's so nice
when you put this on like I could just
apply this
like it just feels so nice makes my lips
just feel so nice and smooth and like
creamy is such a creamy texture it's so
easy to apply they're just the best
thing like they're really pigmented
glosses as well no I used to be such
kind of like a mad girl because I would
only wear lipsticks that actually show
up on my lips and I find a lot of bosses
already that pigmented don't show up
very well on my lips however I found
these and these are the one I hardly
ever wear matte lipsticks anymore
because they're just when they dry out
on my lips so these are the one to go by
they're amazing go get them
yes now my favorite eyeliner ever is the
Han I mean ever is that the Maybelline
New York master ink matte liner now this
is so good because the tip is so easy to
use obviously it's a little bit thicker
and then it points up towards the end of
the stick but the best thing about this
is it lasts all day
like it's so jet-black and honestly you
would not like rub off at all like it's
so good I've tried so many liners that
are great when you first apply them but
then after a while it just kind of fades
and doesn't really look the same like
the worst thing ever it's when your
eyeliner comes off right so this won't
like trust me this one and if it does
like I would be so shocked because
there's lasts all day or night for me
like it's amazing and again it's so
affordable I think it's like three
pantheist do something and honestly I
think I've had this same one for about
yea probably the whole of 2017 no this
is gonna be no shocker to anybody and I
do apologize for talking about tarte
again but i just love their products so
much so i quickly want to talk about top
shape tape smoking about this so many
times so I'm gonna really quickly go
through this it's so creamy its
long-lasting it gives such a glow it
definitely doesn't break up my skin it's
really amazing for like right in your
skin as well I also do have darker
shades at the Tarte shape tape and I do
actually use it as a contour as well
it's really good but this is just
amazing because how creamy it is
and it's like it's thick but it's so
plentiful so this is what's the best
thing ever the next product is also a
concealer this is the collection lasting
perfection now the normal concealer is
absolutely great
it looks practically the same as this
but this one here is the color
correction concealer so this is the same
but it's actually a green concealer if
you guys get any like a redness on your
skin or like you have a spot that's just
really red or maybe you get acne or
something that you want to cover up then
this is amazing obviously we know that
green cancels out the red so it's gonna
be really good anyway is basically it's
this a great concealer you should go and
try it out but this green one is really
good because whenever I get redness and
this is the one that I use and it does
wonders so I think this is the final
product
yes it is I feel kind of bad because I
feel like I should have included a
little bit everything but I really
doubled this video to be too long but
the final product that I want to talk
about is a by tarte again and this is
the lights camera lashes mascara the
best mascara you were ever ever ever use
i mean in my opinion literally not only
is the packaging so pretty but it makes
your lashes look so pretty is such a
long-lasting mascara it really cultural
lashes it gives some amazing volume
amazing length if I could create my own
mascara it will be exactly in this like
hands-down the best thing I've ever
tried so everyone that there are my
favorite I'm averse beauty products of
2017 now I know they're a little bit
random I know I had a lot more positives
than negatives but my that's a good
thing right I feel like more of you
wanted to see my positive rather than
negative anyway because we tried to be
positive as much as we can so yeah I
