be and it gets me so much I don't think
I can even do anymore like honestly
those days this video is possibly even
if you know one of the hardest videos of
ever had film and sometimes it just gets
me so much you know like I just I don't
know what to do anymore just like I just
see these comments and in I know it's
driving to someone people couldn't slow
me everyone I'll come back to my channel
now today I'm going to be reacting to
the nasty mean and hate comments I get
throughout my videos I get so much more
support and love from you guys if I
didn't then I wouldn't be doing what I'm
doing right now so for that I am so so
thankful for and even though I want to
do a different video where I actually
get to read out all the comments which
are actually that's nice you know but I
just wanted to react to be paid comments
because half of them actually crack me
up like people always ask me like just
hate get to you the answer that question
is no it doesn't get to me at all
because I just hover them I just slide
just to bid so today I'm going to be
reading out I'm reacting to make a
comment so hope you guys enjoyed if you
do do smash a big thumbs up and also
subscribe down below if you guys have
already but yeah without further ado
let's get into this video hope either we
go
no joke before we get into this video I
have bacon flops on right now and it
looks so good but it was the only pair
of socks we had in the house my dad got
it as like a joke present ones wait can
you can you see like can you see again
my dad got this is a joke present one
and I'm actually wearing them on my feet
the only character a results I can find
so Neagle anyway right let's actually
get in to what was with that flick-flick
okay let's let me get into the video now
hate comment number one drop squad says
you slapped thank you Joe much
appreciated saccharin is such a freak
she shouts and screams
two-year-old i unsubscribed why do i
challenge if you're such a scaredy-cat
ah-ah-ah weirdo first of all Sierra I
just want to say if you're I'm
subscribing to my channel just leave
like this no need to comment saying your
unsubscribing why are you still here if
you want subscribing leave I don't want
you on my channel if you don't worry
about my channel when you think I'm a
freak
then just get the hell out of my channel
but no your sylia commenting probably
why and I bet you still subscribed come
on Sierra I know I mean the best thing
about the best thing about this comment
Louis II ah-ah-ah
weirdo sighing finally Sierra to answer
your question why do I challenge you to
purchase scaredy cat the reason it's
called a challenge video is because I've
set myself a challenge to do some things
that either I find hard something I've
never done before because it's a
challenge and setting myself a challenge
and if it were a challenge if it was
something that I love to do then it
wouldn't be called a challenge video
it'd be something along the lines of
come watch me doing what I love to do
video therefore it would be so boring so
that's why is that myself is challenge
and yeah I was pretty scared
I'm not glow like Kali Pinkman right
saffron's acting is awful fair enough
but only going to shot with a bone
everybody is obviously like entitled to
their own opinion and stuff but do just
want to point out like I don't think I'm
amazing a drama not like saying that at
all but did actually get a star
distinction in drama so go go professor
Kenya says sacrum Barker is fair
enough from Aaron Riley says that
clickbait for the video though hashtag
no hey hashtag not sup buddy Aaron okay
one thing that does actually bug me in
life like if anybody says this through a
comment or just in life or just in
general
it actually bugs the hell out of me and
this is one people go no offense or not
hating yes you are honestly if I said to
you guys watching right now if I went
you you're ugly no offense
please tell me you'll be offended by
that it's some of your straight-up
working your ugly no offense you're not
going to be like off my fence Jenkins
chill sure what and care like no could
you said no offense is fine no like that
is offensive and I mean every property
didn't try and be offensive but Aaron it
is offensive and just put in the hash
tag not hating you are hating like you
are hating on me you are being offensive
to me but I understand that obviously
you didn't mean for it to come across
like that but it is fun by the way do
you just want to clarify that is my body
on the thumb now I'm not that great at
Photoshop
so I mean I can barely get my thumbnails
so yeah maybe right in there so she's
drunk and she's had Botox firstly well I
wouldn't be drunk and why they'd be
drunk in a video and secondly I'm 16
like I don't have wrinkles yet so I mean
this is my face I don't have wrinkles
yet luckily if I did then I probably of
Botox put it on so they let it go but
the funny thing about this common is it
has 33 likes and then somebody replies
down below so this replies I thought
that then same so you know I thought we
had each other's back girl you know but
clearly not the heater I gave you this
one because the payee coolant is my
favorite hate comment over time now this
kid charlie page I see him calling on
every single video of mine okay every
single video he's a really big Gator of
mine yet he's a first person to comment
on every one of my videos
therefore he has to be subscribed to me
and he has that botros notifications on
so Charlie before you started did for me
just remember you're the one who's
subscribed me to charge justices charlie
comments on this video
cellphone literally looks like the 40
year old stepmom who has spent thousands
on plastic surgery that fake bitch
charlie
all I have to say to that is I've spent
no money on plastic surgery so therefore
you're crazy
complimenting me I mean you get taller
look about plastic surgery when I happen
I would kind of take that as a
compliment
so thank you Charlie and thank you for
commenting on every single one of my
videos it is so rich dated mattias bar
is 4000 would stepmom you must have
spent a long time thinking about what
ever we should write length you must
have some thought into that common and
that Wow Charlie I need a phase does why
does she laugh so much in every video
like a retard
she was always acting high now firstly a
a high secondly I love to laugh and you
drop my phone I love to laugh like
laughing it's like a good thing like I
don't know how you can hate somebody for
laughing and enjoying themself like
girls well I'm just having fun in my
videos so Samantha O'Neil says saffron
you wrote a little bit you told George
yet the darkest balloon yet you hardly
blew yours up now Samantha just zooming
in to your picture here
I mean look fairly young I don't think
your mom would really appreciate you
using that language I'm a bitch because
I told Tommy to blow every more in a
challenge I mean he's been made like
really did that deep like this is a
challenge video it's joking around with
my mate like we're having a challenge
but it's not Mike's proper proper
serious so I mean the course area that
is a little bit far but hey I'm moving
on next comment is from Lydia and she
says I'm sorry but it looks like you
have mud on your forehead Thank You
Lydia that is just how I live kids you
know I'd say every time I do eye makeup
video I know I'm not on a party but I
know that I'm not trying to be a makeup
artist but you guys always ask me if I
can do makeup related videos and then
whenever I do like a makeup look or ever
people just dissed me for it and they're
like oh you should think I've thrown up
to somebody's like oh you kids at it
like maybe tried it instead of doing
that and therefore it won't look so dark
on your forehead or whatever but then
when people just write comments like
that and just like fuzzy that was so not
necessary
secondly that's exactly how I like it
like this is how in my
to my makeup I threw my makeup like this
every single day so well if it looks
like mud then I like having my forehead
so there you go
I'm sorry the suppleness being so
pathetic I'm not even going to lie Lucy
hunt says how reactions are so fake how
do people find this funny I mean fair
enough i commentate like if you want to
come and hate on my videos like both
right like yeah but it doesn't annoy me
when people like it's fake its fake like
I'm exactly the same on camera as what I
am off camera so therefore for people to
just judge me that quickly and say that
I'm fake like it doesn't get to me but
it's like it's annoying because I'm like
I'm exactly the same on camera as I am
off so my actions aren't fake
great yeah okay moving on you need
braces in your teeth apart
I guess this mission made me wait to be
honest like I don't actually my motif
that much honestly if somebody says
something else like something I was
reading secure about maybe I would be
like okay that's like gotta swing before
once out but I don't even my my teeth so
that we can bother me it just is made me
laugh and how many best friends do you
have you could only have one idiot okay
idiot I can have as many best friends I
want to have like Compu Condon you don't
need to just have one best friend all my
best friends have different best friends
if that makes sense like you know what I
mean I don't have one best friend
there's no way you could have one best
friend because there's so many great
great friends of mine that we just call
best friends so therefore I so call me
an idiot because I have more than one
best friend like so stupid I mean come
on
let me example though if you guys have
more than one best friend because they
guarantee pretty much everybody watching
this has more the longer friend and if
you don't then you clearly just have a
really great best friend but it
definitely is possible to have more than
one best friend
okay there was all the hate comments I'm
going to read out throughout today's
video I hope you guys all enjoyed you
just want to say that thank you all so
so much because it was like you so it
could be such a long time to find those
those hate comments because there is so
much
I'm positivity on both my channels and
for that I am so so grateful for so
thank you so much to each and every one
of you that supports me each and every
day honestly I'm so so grateful for each
and every one of you and I know I
couldn't say that enough and I wish I
could tell you all in person but
hopefully one day and I also just want
to say as well that whenever I do get
hate comments you can have my back like
you guys are so so supportive like I
know you have my back and that I'm so
grateful for but again like you don't
even need to do that like I'm really not
bothered about the hate comments at all
so you don't you've got your way to do
that but thank you again so much for all
your support I want to do like a video
on reacting to like just comments in
general so not just hate comments so if
you want to do that soon like me
actually reacting to most comments on
this channel then also let me know it
down below quickly before I end this
video just to let you guys know I am NOT
doing another reacting to hate comments
so don't even bother trying to waste
your time because I ain't doing another
one in slowly and I am really hopeful
right now but gonna love and leave you
