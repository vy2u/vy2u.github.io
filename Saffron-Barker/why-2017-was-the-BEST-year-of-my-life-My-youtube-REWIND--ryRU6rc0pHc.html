huge huge thank you for making 2017 that
the best it could possibly ever be I
have never ever ever had such a greater
year than 2017 you will be missed
anyway so I kind of left 2016 not really
knowing what to expect for 2017 I just
hit 500,000 subscribers that obviously I
was a mind blown by and I had just
technically like graduated or left high
school so it was the first year that I
ever decided to do youtube full-time
about is the only year by decided still
youtube for time I was really nervous
edit every know what to expect so in the
first month of January 2017 prymaat
approached me to ask me to do my very
own ranked with them obviously I like
freaked out I was like yes is what my
favorite stores ever they are the best
the next eight months I went up to
London I put my heart and soul into this
and went back and forth I was working
with the buyers meeting the designers
doing a ton and different stuff of this
range the you guys seem to love and that
saw us right away just saying but yet it
turned out to be a pretty amazing so
this is what happened I am bringing out
my own rage in Primark
in vinny Manchester Piccadilly store and
this is what it looks like it is so cool
literally
I wanna see it makes me the happiest
girl alive and it's just crazy when you
think about it and also for those of you
asking is there gonna be a second range
watch this space in a 2017 I traveled to
so many countries that honestly I never
ever thought I would go to let alone in
a year I went to Sweden with Claire's
tonight this is so insane but whistles
staying in the Eiffel Tower and the
rooms and -8Â° the more I'm gonna be
freezing
watch this guy's only what my feet wha
that is this you up to your knee like
you know the time when you say the snows
up to my knee it actually is oh my god
Oh guys look my brother
I haven't we don't believe in the far do
we we don't believe in it so we're
having this from Roxy I've even got
tables and chairs who knows my I will
need to work on your sis boys oh my god
Gary let's do it and I'm doing I don't
know what I went to Morocco Egypt
different parts of America I went to I
went to Madrid with YouTube I went to
Paris with my best friend I went to so
many places and my most exciting trip of
all I went it to LA with Nickelodeon
they asked me to go out there and be
part of their vlog squad and I also got
to take my mom which was the best thing
ever we had the best time roll clips
that separates out already
is a good cool this is we're walking out
there's the sign are you feeling good oh
well I'm not very good at all this is
like the fourth time I've slept this is
like the fourth time on set now oh my
god I need to just walk down the middle
not on the site like really super shoes
guys we made it at the top we are higher
than the Hollywood sign guys look at the
American flag and then the Hollywood
sign is actually down there that from
the height we've got changes to our
Nickelodeon gear we're about to get
slimed which is going to be scary but
also so much fun at the same time yay
obviously as you guys can see I was
absolutely in my element I could not
believe it I got to walk down the orange
carpet like it was it was a dream come
true and I'm so grateful and it'll be a
memory that I'm always gonna have for a
lifetime not just for 2017 I thought I
went to Paris with my best friend
Anastasia we had the best time ever it
was it's just crazy to think back at it
because I we both got to pay for
ourselves which I never thought that I'd
be able to do and I feel so lucky that I
was able to do that and also anything
goes my family for the first time ever
so I felt like a full grown adult it was
so good let's go right so we've got our
tickets we need to go and pick up our
VIP bands which is so excited so thank
you so much Tiffany if I'm spoiling us
because I cannot wait I think it's like
ah my doing this wrong and uh okay yeah
we can't read French
oh my god wait okay let's do it
you
later that month I got approached by a
Hodor who are a publishing company
I couldn't believe first of all that
they approached me but I did actually
kind of turn it down I was like I'm not
really sure if you don't really think
I'm very interesting and I kind of
thought they wanted me to do an
orthography and I was like no that's not
really me and I didn't want to try and
sell something that I didn't love enough
myself anyways my little heart told me
you know what's up you should go back
and I met the publishers and we actually
came up with a really awesome idea and I
thought you know what this actually
could work so seven months later we all
teamwork created this book saffron Barca
versus real life which by the way it did
actually go to number one seller again I
cannot thank you guys enough the love
and the support that you guys give me
honestly it's a true true true blessing

the most exciting days yet now today I'm

Wales I'm going to Wales today because I

entire day but I loved it so thank you

work on something very exciting so it is
neat approached me for my first TV job

massive deal
bye got to be on a Disney show like just
a one time show and it's a darn show I
was the host and the presenter of it it
was just so cool to see like how it all
went together and how it will work and
that's kind of what I really want to do
in the near future like I'm praying that
I get to do some sort of acting in the
near future because honestly YouTube has
opened so many doors for me already so
that's kind of like what I'm that's what
I'm praying for
but it was so so much fun and the best
part of all I got to go
