video today I'm going to be testing out
a machine that 3d prints your own face
masks so I saw a machine like this in a
video on Facebook basically what it does
is it takes any liquid and turns it into
a face mask it is essentially like
printing out a fruit roll-up in the
shape of your face which to be fair
seems like a great way to customize your
face masks for your specific skin needs
so at the time this specific machine was
unavailable but then I found this
similar machine on Groupon so I ordered
it and now it's here let's take a look
shall we
this is it this is the future this thing
is called the masquerade duet facial
steamer and organic mask maker oh it's
so little she looks like Ian from Wally
doesn't she so basically what happens is
you put the juice into the top and then
you put some of this collagen in there
and then it'll basically like squirt out
the mixture down here and then it'll
solidify in the shape of your face they
basically say that you can put anything
you want in here as long as it's in
liquid form
I feel like generally I have combination
skin I've got like an oily and blackhead
prone nose but I do have like a dry and
wrinkly forehead so I'm not sure exactly
what type of ingredients I should be
using for my skin concerns so let's look
up some recipes and then we're gonna go
out and grab some ingredients and come
back and make some masks so I was
looking online for specific recipes for
our masquerade machine I want to do at
least one like officially sanctioned
recipe just so we can kind of get the
hang of it and also so we know that this
is supposed to work and then afterwards
you know we'll get into some more
freestyle ones this one is called a skin
rejuvenation orange and yogurt mess
oranges are rich in vitamin C potassium
and folic acid some wealthy it's good
for blemished oily and acne prone skin
yogurt naturally helps reduce fine lines
and prevent wrinkles from forming as
excellent source of calcium we will just
absorb it and release better those so
this is my skin before my face mask
making adventures got a nice angry zit
on this side and general eyeliner
residue under the eyes
it's my perpetual state so I've got Eve
hooked up to her little mask making
friend what's going on is like heating
up but I think that when you turn it on
it just does this for a little while
it's just like checking out the world so
next it says please prepare 25
milliliters of any liquid ingredients in
the measuring cup so this recipe calls
for 15 milliliters of the orange juice
ooh there's not that much I thought it
was gonna be like orange juice to the
face but it's kind of just like a little
taste okay so next is the yogurt this
makes me hungry what do you think that's
about 10 milliliters that's about right
so I'm just gonna scoop this out of here
I'm actually kind of nervous because the
Greek yogurt is pretty solid still they
were pretty adamant about the fact that
you weren't supposed to put any solids
in the Machine you'll see I guess so
finally I'm gonna add 70 milliliters of
water
it smells both good and bad like it kind
of smells like you know like when you're
like drink orange juice after you brush
your teeth kind of smells like that
feeling okay so I'm gonna open up the
top pour this liquid into the main
compartment and then I think we're ready
to go and start printing stuff oh wow it
looks like a small toilet so to print it
I have to add one of these tablets of
the bioaktiv collagen and that'll like
make it stick together into the like gel
mask it's kind of reacting in there
oh it's like a bath bomb and then
basically I press the mask mode button I
say let's press the button I want to
press the button Ted and says it takes
six minutes to print out the mask I'm
just I'm nervous I don't know what's
gonna happen I'm just gonna hold it
right here and wait for it to sport it
out mouth oh it does it's a little robot
centipede ish
something's happening oh my god it's
coming out right now
whoa oh it's steam
that kind of cooks the yogurt ooh I
smell pretty good it says that after the
mask has cooled for a few minutes it's
ready for use the mask looks like it's
solidifying it's actually cooling down
pretty quick well if I touch it it kind
of feels like pudding or jello seems
pretty solid all around we just put it
on and see oh my god oh my god it's
heavy oh no I'm gonna put it right on
the feet yeah go right for it oh did I
make it yeah
ghostly a giant noodle oh my god I look
like the screaming emoji I look like the
scream
yeah batter Jason Voorhees it's
definitely solid but as I was picking it
up it was almost stretching in my hands
like raw pasta or something or like raw
dough Oh Megan okay so this is my Greek
yogurt and orange juice face mask I
cannot sit up straight because it's just
flopping down my face I'm gonna leave
this on for like 20 minutes just to get
a good nice steeping session that'll
also give the Machine time to cool down
and then after that we'll make a couple
more masks of my own creation a couple
tricks up my sleeves I'm not wearing any
sleeves but my metaphorical solution so
I would say that overall the face mask
feels nice on my face
but the literal weight of the gel is
like pulling the face mask back so my
ears are like getting wet besides the
gravity factor I'm doing pretty well I
think Krusty's interested he's
definitely interested my spirit under
people wanted the Greek yogurt okay so
it's been about 25 minutes of this thing
on so I think we're ready to take it off
should I snack on it a little bit
oh-oh-oh tastes bad it's got your pores
in there it looks like a giant phlegm
bomb oh I think that was just a little
bit more wet than I was expecting but I
actually do feel kind of refreshed after
words I'm not sure if my pores look any
smaller but I am feeling a little bit of
acidity from the orange juice all right
so that was their recipe and I'd say
that was pretty successful overall now I
want to try something a little more
customized a little off the beaten path
so I was thinking where's the best place
to get stuff that's in liquid form that
could be good for your skin a juice
place so I went and got two juices for
my recipes well I got this one which is
a blue lemonade with blue spirulina and
in which has antioxidants which could be
good for my clogged pores and I also got
this
which has rosewater in it which I know
is supposed to be super hydrating and
refreshing so that could be good for
like the drier areas of my face I'm just
trying to cover different terrain I'm
also hoping that they'll mix together to
make a purple color so I'm gonna do 12
and a half milliliters of the blue and
12 and a half milliliters of the pink
these look like kool-aid I'm surprised
these are healthy for you so I'm gonna
mix them together it's not super vibrant
but it's definitely couple something to
note is that you don't actually have a
lot of the active ingredients in the
mask itself like it's a lot of water
mostly alright so I'm gonna put my lid
back on and then we're going to get
started oh she's alive she has fun to
stroke like this I understand why Wally
is attracted to her all right here we go
oh she just peed it out interesting oh
it's so pale oh oh I touched it oh no no
no I looked I touched it before it was
ready and I ruined it I'm sure it'll
still be fine on the face but I'm sad
that I gooped it I just need to leave it
alone for a second that's just so fun to
touch so gooey oh alright ready yeah
it's so clear oh oh it definitely smells
better than the last one I don't know if
it tastes better than the last one nice
view of the pimp it does feel it like
really nice and cooling and refreshing
besides the fact that I am NOT purple I
think I like it look at my eyebrows I
look like Eeyore I wonder if I'm just
not giving it like quite enough time to
set so it's kind of like still a little
liquidy when it gets on my face and kind
of stretchy I just want to put it on my
face right now alright I think we're
ready to take this off I have shed my
layers there's like stuff of nightmares
heystop okay so this is the result of
the pressed juice mask I think that the
rose water was a pretty active
ingredient like it could definitely
smell the rose
the lemon so I feel pretty soothed or at
least wet this one was quite refreshing
and nice I would do this again so for my
next and final face mask I decided to
continue along the customization route I
also have a tired skin so maybe we
should try something with some caffeine
in it so we've decided to make a face
mask out of Mountain Dew I don't think
this will actually be good for my face
but they did say that you could put any
liquids in there so within reason this
is the liquid it seems to me to be
probably the last thing that you would
want to use in your face mask so we have
to try it oh yeah that stuff smells
radioactive so I'm gonna go for a full
25 milliliters of Mountain Dew it's
funny because we went from like Greek
yogurt and pressed juice to like no
because it's just gonna be like what the
fuck it's just gonna be diluted Mountain
Dew and then we need our collagen kill
I'm surprised it isn't fizzing more it's
okay Eve we're in this together
alright she's alive she's awake she's
worried she's considering the Mountain
Dew
oh she seems to have accepted it ooh
alright Eve whoo this one's super clear
yeah none of the real Mountain Dew color
in it but there's Mountain Dew in there
ooh so squishy do you see this it's
almost like a little like spot where
there's like no mask right there I
wonder if that was some carbonation
alright let's put this thing on this
one's very thin Oh Lord smelling doom
there's definitely a big hole in my
forehead I don't know why or how that
happened off the bat it feels stickier
than the other ones I wonder if like
carbonated soft drink is just not the
ideal thing to make a face mask with it
does however feel and smell refreshing I
don't know I thought it would be weirder
but I'm also glad that it's not that
weird oh my god this hole on my forehead
is just getting bigger now that we're in
the middle of doing it I don't really
know why we did this press the goodies
and get food leave that cat alone he's
80 all right let's take it off
yeah I'm gonna throw this out it's kind
of gross the residue is not sticky per
se but it's like 1% Mountain Dew kind of
sticky for the most part though it
doesn't feel that different it smells a
little different and I feel like I know
that it's not as good for me but I think
the collagen pill is like really like
the most prominent ingredient in this
stuff I don't think the Mountain Dew
facemask was actually that bad but I
don't feel any caffeine rush so I think
I was wrong all in all I would say that
this machine is super fun the slightly
disappointing part is that the masks are
pretty similar from mask to mask the
yogurt one was probably the most
different and in hindsight the most
exciting because it had like some chunks
some texture a little more hold to it
because of that but with the other ones
I'm not sure just how much of the custom
ingredient benefits you're actually
seeing there definitely in there but
it's just a lot of collagen mostly I
feel like I'm just having fun with this
machine I don't know if it's really any
better or worse than other face masks I
think it's probably about the same I
think that I would actually continue to
use this I don't know when the next time
I'm gonna be having a slumber party is
but this seems like a perfect slumber
