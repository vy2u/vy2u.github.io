hold on should be like this well if you
can't have it
hello friends and welcome to another
video this is Candace I am sure you guys
have heard of the Molly Cosmetics illest
Bunge it's like a silicone you one thing
so I thought I was really clever by
saying oh we'll get a silicone fake boob
insert and then put it back to back
against the silicone makeup sponge
because people use these things as do
for this thing what I thought would be
fun to do would be to take these guys
and these guys and do one half of our
face with the fake boob and the other
half of our face for the Phillips buns
and then I was like Sofia what if we
also use our real boobs
what if we blended our makeup out with
each other did this is Stephanie is
online for numbers okay what do you
usually use so I recently got the our
teeth brush and it is so happy and so
soft I do the G blender don't worry guys
it is the nude color so it's not just my
entire foundation covering this but it's
just getting old so we're the tip is
like nip it's a nipple the CIMA stage is
nipple I never used the silicon Redford
that it's amazing these I don't know I
think that when people said that boob
inserts were due for this thing they say
meant like smaller little things yet
slip in the bottom of your bra yeah this
is a hefty I ordered me from Amazon
thinking that these would be way smaller
because they gave me a choice and I
chose a cup this is like a full seat
almost like fitted matinee this is
easily a V plus they also have like
little nipples like somewhat and then
stuffed over you do this like if you try
to fall asleep
how good is that meal that that's
feeling really comforting I do feel a
little bit like a truck over time or ate
an eye test welcome to my boobs chapel
how's the food how's the food you wanna
do the honors and open it there's two of
them in here
oh crap yeah and back okay
what does more packaging cool they're
well smaller than I thought they are
kind of little but I mean I guess I knew
that when they came in this small bag
and we just take a moment
it's okaaaaay favorite beer this big
firm it kind of also like holds the
shape like if I squish it it kind of
takes a second come around I like this
it's satisfying I also like want to bite
it in half mmm
your brother spell your favorite that
sounds good though I'm going to go left
side boom right side Silla plunge
disclaimer neither pandas nor I are
professional makeup artists
we're just mediocre medium at makeup
kind of people trying to show you guys
how like it's like a normal use case
would go
yeah just we're holding it like kinda
like us what's a good taco
wow that's I feel like I just kind of
climate flashing around so you're out
what's your method just hate your face
and then move around
yeah cuz like what the Beautyblender
that I use you basically just beat up
your face right you just like kind of go
like up and down like hitting it just
bang it all really honest until I'm
getting a little on for him it's heavy
go to a shake weight feel like you just
have to hit your face for like hours
yeah I don't really feel like it's
really getting in there it's just on
there trying to get in with the nipple
like in the group I don't think the
nipple is working out for me though if I
doesn't look fully blended nessa
bothering me I'm nervous to smear
because I know you near with a blender
you're actually just taking the product
off
oh no yeah this looks just like beat it
into your face I mean I think that's as
good as it's going to get obviously
these things are not marketed to put on
your makeup so the fact that it isn't
going well doesn't say anything about
how good this product is at being stay
clean here's the problem I have with
actually trying to use me each other's
boobs and makeup brushes is we can't
fold them like this oh that's right you
would literally have to be like this is
or just so with the Scylla funds
it's just marketed to do foundation and
they say that for like if you need to
finish off with your Beauty Blender or
your brush or whatever they offer that
up as an instruction but the idea is if
you do
most of your face with this thing then
you still save product and it's still
easier to clean didn't say anything
about concealer oh well yeah like you
can turn the little corners and do
concealer with it alright let's get into
it already old it's different so it
stays on this is making a noise Oh
someone over here sitting there like ah
stop what you do and then I think it
already does a lot better coverage I
just wonder if there's a level of
blending out my makeup that I have not
reached yet yeah is there like some
finesse that I'm liking I want to use my
brush I think actually the fact that the
food is softer kind of makes it easier
to like slap against your face I mean I
can get my in a little more crevices
with this this first no oh and her a
little bit it's like I haven't wasted
any product right pretty much all the
products on my face I will agree with
that is that sometimes when I do put
this down I'm like how much products
went into here and then when you wash it
your life if I slap for a while the
large surfaces look kind of good mm-hmm
cutlet all the way to soap so I think
it's good for like under-eye crevice but
it did take over and now that I'm
looking at it besides like kind of right
above my brow and over here the soulless
ones actually did do a pretty good job I
think it just takes a while and a lot of
slapping around easy to clean makes a
nice noise it'll wake you up that's for
sure you're tired in the morning mitch
is like I'm kind of addicted to doing it
now oh this feels so much better it just
want to absorb the shock this more just
like oh no I have foundation on my boobs
but of course that was going to happen
soak it up just press into this to wipe
it off I do have some product left on my
hand which I don't usually have and I
didn't have from using the boob and to
then after a while of slapping I think
that large parts of my face do you look
blended out I think honestly I'm not
used to this much product ending up on
my face maybe we just use too much
product I think that even though this is
way
more fun I think that the still fun
desire yeah
imagine being in my makeup like with
some friends and being like hold on let
me do a touch-up between these two and
your normal thing what would you choose
I mean is it because I love cumference
you know I think I choose this and then
kind of buff it out with it I appreciate
the Phyllis punch or what it is I think
it's pretty cool but I think that the
original Beauty Blender subtractor be
funky to them who I bite down
how's that sign is it and just ate some
foundation I'm not sad next video we eat
this stuff smell
