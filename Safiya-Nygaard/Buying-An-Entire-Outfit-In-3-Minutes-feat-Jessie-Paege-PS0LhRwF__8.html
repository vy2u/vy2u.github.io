video I'm here with Jesse Paige who is a
youtuber and resident expert of dyed
hair thank you for being here today
Jesse thank you for the compliment I'll
take it Jesse has thankfully agreed to
join me in what I'm calling the mad dash
clothing pass beautiful name we're
working on it it's a working title so
previously I've done a couple of videos
shopping while blindfolded in which I
wanted to test how using other senses
like fate and deductive reasoning would
suit me while shopping but today is all
about instincts when you are presented
with very little time to make a decision
where does your gut lead you so we're
going to be putting our fashion
instincts to the test and buying a 5
item outfit in three minutes
so I thought it'd be really fun for
Jesse and I to do this together
because we have pretty different styles
and probably pretty different fashion
instincts as you're wearing all black
and you literally went right though
liked it I like color ah that's where we
diverge yeah all right so here are the
rules
five items roughly shakes down to 36
seconds per item but to keep everything
simple we're not gonna include like
travel time in between the stores or
like time in line the clock will only be
going when we're actually like shopping
and choosing additional rules include no
sprinting I feel like we may start a
panic if we just start running but like
power walking is like totally fair and
also we're gonna be going to a different
store for each item so five stores
altogether
one more thing Jesse told me that she's
going on a date later today
turns out I'm also going on a date later
today right Tyler so I thought it'd be a
fun framing for our challenge to try and
find a date outfit that you don't have
to wear on your date tonight but you
could I don't want to that's a story
this conversation there you know exactly
challenge accepted all right a date
night outfit in three minutes or less
let's do it there goes my chances at a
relationship
all right so we're at the mall now magic
we're here so were you guys going on
your date so we're going to a friend's
birthday party not the first day not the
first date okay good so it's not just
like first impressions this is it like
what's the venue sort of its formal she
has a carpet for a party oh so this is
like dressed up where are we going tie
for our date nice yeah because I need to
decide my vibe well put it this way I'll
be wearing gym shorts okay so we're
going to a nice restaurant nice
restaurant yes okay so I'm gonna try and
do something more romantic than I
usually do I'm gonna say romantic so
we're gonna I think go top bottom jacket
shoe and then accessory of some kind
kind of like a a lady's choice at the
end there whatever you want so the first
thing we're gonna go to is forever 21 it
feels like a good place to start there's
a lot of options all right let's go
do you have 36 seconds on the clock okay
go so when we first like ran into
forever 21 I kind of like forgot what we
were doing for a second I literally like
my mind went blank I was like and then
all I could see around me were just like
jackets and sweaters it's all the
sweaters and so I like panicked and like
ran further back into the store being
like where any of the normal shirts I
also experienced the same thing with the
jackets and the sweaters and oh shoot no
it's like it's a party so I need
something a bit more dressed up and I
saw sparkles and I ran I was also
thinking at the same time like I didn't
want to pick something black because I
always go for all black everything so I
guess I was working against my fashion
instincts there but I was like no I need
to find something else I thought it was
funny when there was one point where you
both crossed paths and you gave me this
look of like we got this I didn't even
know that I did it was like you know I
found one top that I liked it was silver
but I just latched on to it like he was
a stuffed animal and it's like it's mine
and then I kept looking for something
else it's a dress that's hot got that
back yeah really I ended up next like a
rack of shirts and just picked up a blue
shirt I guess I'm going with blue
what and then suddenly time was over
this works actually like it
everybody is something I would wear for
ice-skating when I was younger I'm not
disappointed it was weird they both felt
like zero time at all and also like a
lot of time like I was like floating
through space I'm proud of you one of
the colors it's kind of matches your hey
I was gonna say that I'm always down for
some blue and this kind of matches my
single grey hair it's somewhere in there
okay so tops from forever21
chick alright so for the bottoms we're
gonna go to urban finding a size in 36
seconds we'll see how that goes round to
the pants so when we first walked into
Urban Outfitters I saw to my right
immediately a bunch of pants that were
like loose wide-leg pants that seemed to
have like different patterns and colors
and I was like ooh that could be
interesting so I basically beelined
straight for this display on the right
oh yeah these are awesome
this is an early choice for me and then
like walked around a couple of times saw
all the pants that were there oh this
could be cool too
so in my mind it's like okay I want a
blue skirt so I got in there with that
um with that plan and then there were no
blue skirts except for jean skirts which
I felt like wouldn't be dressy enough I
quickly grabbed on to three different
skirts
why was magenta the other one was like
an orange II brow five seconds and I
think the last one was a dark brown
which one's more high-waisted all right
time to make a decision um I decided to
go for the orange II color which is like
I would never have gone for that
typically because I realized the other
skirts weren't high waisted and I was
wearing a crop top these ones are more
high-waisted I'm going with the stripes
so I picked up these black stripy pajama
pants it's almost like a maxi dress but
surprise they're pants I did end up
picking something black but it has
stripes it has stripes okay caught on
top and I felt also like my instincts
were like all right so if we have one
thing that is colorful the rest of it
can be black who cares I thought your
skirt was really cute but it definitely
like was it what you had described
looking for
it was interesting it definitely made
the rest of the outfit a bit of a
challenge because you have warm and cold
tones like the sparkly New Year's
looking top and then this skirt reminds
me a lot of like autumn but it was
exciting alright so we're gonna go for
the jacket to Zara so Jessie has a shot
to sort of dress this thing up item
number three the jacket let's go so when
we walked into Zara I once again kind of
forgot what we were doing with Zara it
was like many mannequins and I was like
oh shiet so I literally kind of forgot
and I was just like oh that's cute does
it wait no I need a jacket damn it
so I sort of veered off to the left just
to sort of like look on the wall cousins
are there was also a lot of stuff on the
walls yes so I saw black leather jackets
in the back when I was like oh that's
cool I was about to go and run to those
and then on the way in I saw this um
kind of like a like a fitted long blazer
I just grabbed it on the way in case I
didn't make it to the leather jackets in
time and I did make it to the leather
jackets and then right at the end is
like you know what I grabbed this first
there must be a reason for that
Oh what's this second I guess I'm going
with this I don't even know what this is
so I grabbed randomly this large
cardigan looking thing with like faux
fur it's the only thing I could find Oh
too late
time's up the thing is the jackets not
like bad like it's not like oh it's a
horrible jacket I just I would never
have thought of it for my outfit at all
it kind of looks like a fuzzy blanket
though it looks like a socially
acceptable Snuggie yes so I have these
two and the thing is this is really cool
but I also own a black leather jacket
already I'm gonna go with my first
choice this is the first thing that I
picked up so I'm gonna assume that
happen for a reason and are you gonna go
with this the Browns matched like the
skirt match with the jacket I felt like
the jacket was really gonna be the thing
that would like save the outfit and make
the two very different pieces work
together I think it's a cool blazer to
be honest I thought it was super cool
yeah okay so those are our jackets from
Zara so shoes are next yeah
so we're gonna head into H&amp;amp;M what size
shoe are you nine and a half ten see
we're both gonna be in the same section
alright so the shoes were pretty far
back in the store so we came back here
you know just so we don't run anyone
over trying to come in yeah they're
right behind us so we're gonna turn
around start the clock and pick a pair
so when we started the thirty seconds I
just immediately started looking for
sizes that would work from what I could
see there were some like plain black
boots or booties that would have
probably works but I like didn't want
just like a plain black boot I wanted
like something a little more interesting
and I saw a corner that was shining
silver and I went for it when I started
looking for shoes I also paid a lot of
attention to size right away there are
really cool black boots that um have
like a three inch heel they were there
were booties like that type of look
however I could not find them in my size
8.5 8.5 and then at the bottom I found
black knee-high boots yeah those are
kind of cute 10 seconds I started
looking through these silver shoes and
none of them were my or our size at all
there are my size and anything and then
underneath the silver shoes was a silver
and black speckled pair of booties with
like a low chunky heel and there was
only one of them and I was like this
isn't gonna be my size well it's a nine
and a half yeah so I was like well it
doesn't even matter if I didn't like
these cuz I have to have these because
these are the only ones in my house I
think I'm going to go with these there
are knee-high boots that are in my size
for once I actually was really happy
with the shoes I think that for the
shoes it was a lot more about like what
was there and what we could find rather
than instinct but I'm pretty happy with
the silver shoes like I was happy to get
something that wasn't just like a plain
black bootie and I was just like alright
we're going with it we're getting
accessories next yes so we're going to
top show the fun part so for our last
item we went for a freestyle accessory
anything that we want it basically
so earlier in the day we were talking
about how we kept seeing these training
conductor hats yeah absolutely it's like
a sort of like mid-2000s Lizzie McGuire
hat yes so I found two hats they also
found a black beret and I found the
train conductor hat in my head I
immediately was like okay so my outfit
is black blue green and silver so I need
something that's got some blue hopefully
some silver that'd be awesome
and as soon as we walked in i saw a
little bag that had like green leaves on
it like embroidered and I was like
that's interesting so I picked that up
and then I sort of turned around doing a
scan of the store and I saw on a little
table with a lot of other bags a small
bag that had like dragonfly shaped
rhinestones on it basically alright so I
was looking for something green to tie
all it all together there both have
green in them but I think this green is
close for my shirt right 10 seconds the
black beret was cool but I had never
worn one of the different styles of hats
we literally actually did a conversation
about these hats while we were in
between stores and how they're really
trendy right now so I'm going to get
this hat I think it'll match with the
shoes and it'll really like fit the
whole outfit together 5 I'm the only one
I've had extra time for this is what
we're going with so what did you do at
that time was over because I'm never
experienced that I just looked at them
it's at least beautiful about that
exactly I said yes to the bag so with
our accessories that completes our three
minutes outfits all right so we're back
now we have our outfits in their bags
downstairs and I think we should go try
them on Jessie's not saying anything
she's just nervous I think that they'll
be good I guess we're about to find out
Oh
Jessie what do you think of yours okay I
would never typically wear this outfit
or pick it out but I really like it I
was going to say a stylish newspaper boy
Yeah right
that is like working for the higher-end
newspaper what do you think is like your
favorite part about it like which item
is your favorite either the jacket or
the hat they both were things that I was
unsure of at the end as to which I
didn't skinny get I'm gonna challenge
myself today who knows if it's gonna
work wish me luck
I mean it's early to say but Jessie you
think it's date worthy I think for this
event it might be a bit odd I think
really just a general date night I feel
like this after you soft you this is a
date outfit was it Tyler I don't care if
you think it's a date night outfit or
not because I'm wearing it on our date I
don't think that the fluffy jacket was
an outfit ruiner but it definitely took
over the outfit like it definitely is
steering it in like a specific direction
oh you look a little bit like I got
glamorous Beverly Hills mom I was gonna
say a rich housewife it's better than a
cracker yes and I have to go on a date
with that see that boys works with this
outfit but I think that overall it's
interesting it's not something I would
usually pick out either it's a little
abstract yes Oh God the things that are
competing in my outfit are like the
pants and the jacket so I feel like I
would literally wear this outfit just
with like tighter jeans or something or
this without the jacket your top does
match Jessie's hair a little bit like it
kind of works it's my bag and my top and
Jessie's head do I go on the date you
now yes screw the other guy dresses your
the other guys
go ahead and go to the Nutcracker so I
say this was part style challenge part
running around a little bit of brisk
power walking but nobody got hurt so I
think that we both wanted a Jesse
exactly and my dignity might still be
