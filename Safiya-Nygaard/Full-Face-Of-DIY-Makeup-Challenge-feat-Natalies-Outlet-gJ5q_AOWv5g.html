video today I have Natalie from
Natalie's outlet here I are going to be
doing a full face of DIY makeup also if
you're wondering where we are we're at
VidCon right now oh my look like her is
our or not now natalie has a channel if
you guys don't know check it out in the
description box below natalie has done a
few different DIY makeup challenge type
I have you put food on your finger
you put both supplies as well yeah yeah
well today I went online and I found a
few different recipes for homemade
makeup so we're going to try a DIY
makeup challenge to see if we can make
these recipes work and combine them all
into a full face of homemade makeup and
once it's on we're going to be looking
fly and we're going to be exploring the
last bits of VidCon including the last
VidCon party let's hope it looks good
we're going to start off with foundation
okay so this recipe is from a place
called wellness mama
hello mama and the recipe calls for shea
butter argan oil and we don't have me we
don't have any emulsifying wax so we're
just going with shea butter and our kick
aloe vera gel witch hazel and then cocoa
powder and clay for the pigment we've
got 2 teaspoons of argan oil or jojoba
oil to begin do you oh my god did you
guys see the smoke coming off it that
was too quick I'm turning us down this
fire alarm I got you
Oh either sprinkler oh there we go good
sport alright just go for it it's on
super low heat so hopefully it all
starts like killing us and then we've
got one teaspoon of shea butter whoo or
cooking makeup it feels like we're about
to make it all water so yeah all we're
supposed to do is just melt it together
there it is this is where the
emulsifying wax would go we couldn't
find any in stores so we had to go
without it but it's supposed to help
with a consistency so I wouldn't
actually recommend leaving it out let's
see if the whole thing just cracked in
my hand smells like a farm by a pig farm
it did
add the aloe and which people oh nice
something's been freaking woo
BAM okay so that's supposed to make a
lotion so nice and mix it announced it
this is my new technique actually I'm
just going to chop it up that looks like
homemade lotion to you it does look does
it in its own way yeah done how does it
feel that's actually really nice whoo I
like that yeah I have really dry skin I
have eczema until I wasn't really like
them like I already feel this being
really nice and moisturizing so maybe if
you know the foundation doesn't work out
we could just lotion it up just grease
ourselves up naturally up muscles oh no
I'm gonna dull out our it looks kind of
like all those dead jellyfish yeah into
each of our little containers because
we're going to get slightly different
shades of foundation yeah starts with
zinc and clays so what I got is
bentonite clay would you like the
coverage gotcha yeah yeah actually all
right I'm going to mix in the clay it
looks like little nice minerals in there
or something so now we're going to open
the cocoa powder she just has to add it
in like pinches and paste like as
desired I feel like I already added too
much and when it go rest
mmm that's better so that actually looks
pretty nice it looks like a nice blow
yes it's quite sheer it's very sheer
yeah I think it's just going to be like
a little grey but you know it'll be a
fun time now we're gonna bring in dig in
I look like a mud bath or like a bird
poop to my face
jo is coming along you just have to mix
it the aloe vera gel makes it feel super
super nice but the chunks of clay are a
questionable addition it looks like
banana pudding it doesn't feel like I
should leave this on my face right yeah
feels like I should wash it off I agree
wow you can quit a few seasons
difference right here I just look like I
have beard going on okay look at this
forgot to ask it's the cocoa I think
that mess it up for me
yeah I think it's a little difficult
seriously oil having a hard time talking
because I feel like my face is slowly
cementing I think it's the clay actually
we look like we're having a fun day at
the spa basically what we look like
foundation check next up we're going to
do brows in
eyeliner frame see so we have a few
things here that we're going to use to
make DIY brow powder mascara and
eyeliner so we're going to start with a
brown so there is no recipe for that
we've got this activated charcoal here
so I was just thinking that we put in
like activated charcoal into one of
these things and like a little bit of
cocoa powder so at first it's promising
but then it's piling by so that it looks
a little bit like just extra hairs which
is exactly what what we need it after oh
no you know what quite fierce and I'm
just curious it stays on just blow on my
eyebrow concealer on no come on no it's
better I actually like this more than
mine
it'll be more defined I feel you know
what also is pretty simple like I feel
like it just kind of spreads naturally
and I made this recipe all myself
next we'll do eyeliner really quick the
recipe that they've got is literally
just two teaspoons of coconut oil four
teaspoons of aloe vera gel there's a lot
of aloe vera so we're just making it a
lot of this and then one two taps tools
of activated charcoal they just say to
combine them together just a lot of aloe
vera I don't know I didn't know that
aloe vera was the place to be looking
promising let's just see what happens
this is our like finished mixture I mean
it was a little bit simple but hopefully
it'll be something at all oh wow well
you didn't went for that I know it
happened it was goofy it's like the more
I apply the more it goes away yeah like
a love that doesn't want to be loved
usually I do a cat eyeliner so let's see
what happens if I try and do that here
yours looks a little better though if I
just keep patting it you can kind of add
coverage it's not probably the worst
eyeliner I've ever done in my life but
it's not really sticking on so up next
is this recipe for DIY mascara which I
found which is literally the exact same
one as a DIY eyeliner but she adds in a
little bit of beeswax so I wonder if we
should just like put some of this on
this guy and try and melt in the beeswax
this is what I bought
there's a giant loaf and I've got a
heavy-duty cheese grater so I was
thinking my husband said braid it in so
she says one teaspoon of beeswax
you're grading skills oh how about this
oh the tail is better get that forearm
strength going could you the shake
weight but instead I am grating beeswax
Ola not so pretty think that's enough
yeah I know I just got carried away
good go girl yeah what do you think oh
yeah that's nothing
okay I'm scooping this in because I
container it actually does look like
mascara something about does beeswax
makes me more hopeful me too
alright so I'm actually applying this on
my bottom lashes because I got eyelash
extensions I don't know if I'd move this
up they're very subtle okay and see past
this eyeliner what do you think the
eyeliner is kind of making it hard for
you to show your beautiful let's see how
it's looking over here can you see
anything
I kind of think that there's a little
bit of color and like a little bit of
separation going on like nothing too
crazy but all right so that's beyond I
just love how you're looking pretty
subtle from the distance and because I
just bought it so before we do lipstick
we are going to be doing a little bit of
cinnamon and cocoa powder for blush and
contour which I actually got the
inspiration for this from one of your
videos full face of soot just a little
bit of the cinnamon right there I'll
determine you know dude chocolate might
be who's already married chocolatey will
you even see the contour is a question
hey hey yes you will I mean it's this
woman here I think you look even
prettier okay I'm going with my cocoa
powder I feel like the cinema is almost
more blendable oh I'll just get one on
the other side then and it works really
good oh look at that strong whoa see one
hello matter cinnamon is where it's at
you guys seriously my favorite Simon the
eyebrows and cinnamon like so yeah I
like it just using powders and much more
problem specific I think that trying to
DIY the entire face you wreck your like
layering misstep over man yes we do have
one thing before I move on to list which
is this RCL Beauty highlighter trick so
I'm just going to take a couple of
sprinkles and then just like put a
little bit of water in my palm and see
if we can't get that pearl off of it oh
look I see it I see it
that's really pretty you can see it a
little bit it's like to light a new
technique
I swear there's some some shimmer there
is shimmer very subtle my problem is as
soon as I put like the water on my face
the foundation started yeah making
itself known again so I guess that's our
face okay so this is our chance to save
the look this DIY lipstick recipe I've
seen people do this before for this
recipe you need one whole crayon half a
teaspoon of coconut oil and 1/4 teaspoon
of all what type of color you need to go
for see yeah how about this one
that's pretty though that's literally
Dijon Wow we're supposed to basically
like chop them into little pieces so
I've been a lot of people do this crayon
recipe yeah
I've also seen Crayola be like we don't
recommend that you put this on your face
so it's non-toxic exactly so it's kind
of like a it's probably fine but do at
your own risk I've of things just you
know I just hold the eye why are you
ready for this jelly I'm writing this is
exciting part very pretty color wow we
looked away for one second and it looks
so pretty oh I have a good feeling about
this Natalie all right there we go whoo
let's put it in any of the little baby
fridge yeah that's perfect I think I'll
be done like commit okay so it is ready
to go so we've got our lip brushes oh oh
that's a nice watch okay we should have
just done DIY crayon lips but then you
wouldn't have gotten to see all of this
the moment we've all been waiting for
it's not incredibly opaque but it is
better than anything else we've done
today yeah I think it's easier with a
finger it's actually really nice and
buttery
you know I'm testing it out it's pretty
good does it like a transparent I really
yeah pretty good oh wow I mean I'm happy
about this lipstick at least one thing
kind of came through I feel like it's
cheap it's effective it's pretty quick
you can make a lot of different colors
so we tried all of these recipes to
figure out that the crayon is pretty
good the best one I love it and you
could maybe also use activated charcoal
in your eyebrows so yeah this is our
full face of DIY makeup I thought that
maybe some more of these might work than
did actually end up working I feel like
it's experimental it's fun like if you
a slumber party like you just gotta get
the recipe down so is this worse or
better than the full face of food a
little more so we are going to go out to
the VidCon party it's like 10:30 10:45
it's great ready we're gonna head out
be there is anyone there honestly
Natalie's looks better right now that's
op session yeah sure you guys ready
viewfinder ready yeah I can't I guess I
listen it's not great okay look it looks
like we're coming out of a party over
here
are there some music happening you can't
really see is a black light
yeah
haha
I love
so that we went to the party and they're
finally staring live especially when it
first and we had people were very nice
yeah and said that it looks great
which I don't know if it did I feel like
people actually went up VIP car because
of that because if we look insane
they're like they must be doing some
things
