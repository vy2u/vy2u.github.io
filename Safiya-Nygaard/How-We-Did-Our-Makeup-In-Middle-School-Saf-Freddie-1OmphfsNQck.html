Lizzie McGuire yeah Elizabeth wire was
relevant to me like essentially even to
this day hello friends and welcome to
another video today I'm with Freddie
singing me me me me me me frederica
we're going to be bringing you a video
that was popular months ago that no
one's really doing anymore but we really
wanted to do it
yeah it's how I did my makeup in not
high school but middle school no school
to me and more fun just because like
it's just super super nostalgic and like
the amount of accessories I used in
middle school was just like ridiculous
and I just like new ly and like me I was
high and Microsoft popping at all times
I went ham Freddie watch me do that is I
went on eBay
I got really excited because I found
some lip gloss that I have used many
years ago and then I went on a bender
and I asked Freddie what she had used in
middle school and I just got like eight
lip glosses with different vendors that
we have a lot of lip products we have a
lot of care clips and we have one single
pressed powder I was in Middle School in
like the early mid 2000 I pretty much
did exactly what a lot of like early mid
2000 girls did but with the added caveat
that my mom was really strict so I would
like Nick this into school and then put
it on a tool ha ha ha into it let's do
it should we start with the lip stuff
yeah Alice that was lip stuff I just
want to show you guys the amount of
things that I bought this one is a
special request by Freddie special place
in my heart
this NYC scroll on glitter lip gloss I
mean you had a lot of different colors
and styles I guess like some work
glitter somewhere just clear but let me
just this NYC brand is so near and dear
to my heart you know going to grocery
stores and drugstores with your mom was
always just like a thing for me and
little cool but like I would always go
and select a little makeup section and
be like boo which what else do I want
today
and this roll-on application is still
early two-thousands might just look at
it I just also want to say that I got
these on eBay and they're supposedly
like pretty authentic to the time so
these might be expired
I'm not recommending that you try these
at home but we will be trying them I
mean you think this does look a little
clumpy like it's been sitting oh my god
oh my god so it's like when smell just
triggers memories II now it's like sweet
oh man yes this is what I had got what's
lost smells like lemon - all I remember
is just like using this lip gloss and
watching a very Jenna oh oh my god is
there any glitter yeah I see some little
tiny bit of glitter no blue tint at all
and super clear I can't really explain
it smells like something that would be
like a body spray bottle but limited to
Bath and Body Works like stores of that
nature is what the smell reminds me of
actually besides the NYP thing the rest
of the lip products are all body though
money's always still lit this thing is
Bobby Bell lip smackers with wick look
at that packaging look I didn't pack it
an ultimate hollow it is not ha which
means I'm slightly around I had this
thing when I was like 9 so this is more
like fourth grade but it still felt
relevant just because I can't believe I
found this on eBay how do you buy it and
I specifically remember that having it
in the fall of fourth grade and someone
being like if you put any more of that
stuff on if your lips are gonna fall off
and you silently pulling it out of my
desk opening it up and you see like
moment I don't know if it doesn't smell
like other lip glosses but it smells
like silica and it doesn't smell my
crayon okay I'm going to put this thing
on oh my god let me go up Hillary oh my
god I think I kind of do a minute stuff
you know that this is one my like love
of crazy lipsticks begin yeah
but I was like this is the color for me
think about like in that like
2001-2002 era me walking around probably
a giant gap kids sweatshirt on and being
like okay first of all wait till in
Wadena you're getting me xenon that they
must have been around then because they
were like girls with 20% remediate blue
the 21st century remember when she had
that holographic disk that was hurt your
head but my hands like the secret to the
ships like interior work any tell she
just did certain I think that we look
great so far
I thought about black doing much -
before this it's because like you know
but then I realized that we were being
true to our middle school selves I
wasn't allowed to the other ones that
Freddie used for these - right
yes tell us a little bit about these
guys so all of these were very just
quick you know another them really had
any actual pin ah God does smell really
old boy it smells a little bit expired
though with that put it on your face huh
it also feels expired on my lips we're
trying to figure out maybe this is just
what things felt like back then things
were different then Bobby Bell flip-flop
I used to have it in my pencil case in
class I would just like flip it and open
it I remember that I remember that right
yeah there's word about this again yeah
I like pop pop it up yeah I don't think
I had a great flavor you guys think this
is a living anything you don't like my
lips it was more about the flip anyway I
think I remember it being like really
poppy and this is like kind of actually
effortful like I'm like can't really
tell there's anything on my lips but you
can tell that my moustache is out and
about today what was the early pieces
like what happened this ends Age of
Empires for me oh he you know I would
employ this is another one that I got
like a little phone tip and like it'll
sort of come off the car the little hole
yeah yeah and the other 2011 this losses
in lipsticks were like less about what
they look like on and more about how
cool does it come attitude look I got it
I look I got so let it bubble out and
then the top part will just come out
completely clear which is you know how
it was supposed to be this one actually
has a weird smell and I always thought
it had a weird
now growing up I continued to use it
that would definitely separate it though
look at the top of it yes it is is way
now look at it so to be here this thing
is like at least more than 10 years old
was baptizing ready you need to put on
your face oh yeah that is so crazy how
reminiscent success is it's all clear
gloss or shimmery yeah all of these
things are simply not attained but like
all of the brands maintain when you see
the tube you're like oh 2004 this is a
going-out gloss well sparkling I'd wear
when I'd be out on the town with my girl
people to like the seven bridges yeah
every middle school being a diamond that
happens between our school and our
brothers cool they always clean out can
pea at my seventh-grade dance they
played one two steps I hear I really
remembered uh I got a bunch of butterfly
clips for Freddie so understand have fun
over here with them you can tell us
about the butterfly clip Freddie and my
mini form of the butterfly clip in the
early 2000 be for the most common I
would have like cornrows or twists going
back all this stuff in the middle of my
head and then at the end of the cornrow
and twist we would put the butter flat
foot
I didn't start wearing like other makeup
besides there's like lip glosses until
eighth grade I got an all made clear
complexion stretch powder and this is
the same thing I remember getting
light/medium I think the color that was
light/medium back in the day so I guess
that would be like 2005-2006 was a
little orange e'er if you take this and
take a little like self pad and just
like push it around my face you know
what there was no rough here it would
just be this and I just like drag it and
like drag it over this - lets drag it
under the eyes I'm trying to give you
guys a good image of my mustache here
just you can get the full effect also
just imagine a little bit of hairs in
here and then a couple years later no
hairs in here and then like a whole
tadpole your little boy they're so cute
I'm like heaven isn't it I lived for a
butterfly butterfly clips and lip gloss
all I needed in that life is in didn't
use hair clips really I used to have a
middle part in the middle of my hair
like this in 6th and 7th grade I had
been
that were straight across the last time
I had bangs you have photos it's so
funny like looking back on the stuff
that I didn't used to do it reminds me
of like all of my fears and trials and
tribulations of like adolescence at
puberty and then coach Hardman like
thankful so hard that's a hard time so
like anything I just meld it like the
littlest smallest things were things
that gonna sue and they think that made
us happy and like there's nothing wrong
with that it's funny to look back on
because I'm like oh I looked ridiculous
but like at the time I was like I feel
great confident yeah it's really hard
and little is feel confident and like if
a gloss with a little glitter and like
crazy sense like make me feel confident
and like it's worth it I also firmly
believed that the weird stuff that we
put on our face as preteens and teens
like make us women we are today you know
like oh you need to go through phases
