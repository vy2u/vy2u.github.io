video today I'm going to be buying and
opening an abandoned storage unit so
lately I've been seeing a lot of people
do videos where they'll buy and open an
eBay mystery box and I figured it would
be fun to open a different type of
mystery box an abandoned storage unit
basically what happens with storage
units is that if someone abandons one
the storage company auctions off the
contents inside which is basically a
glorified way of saying they have other
people pay them to clean it out for them
but you do get to keep whatever's in
there including any hidden gems which
you could hang on to or as some people
do you could resell and it seems like if
you know what you're doing it can be
pretty lucrative I of course however do
not know what I'm doing but after
looking up some local live storage
auction listings and binge watching some
storage wars I've decided to try my hand
at it so we're gonna go to an auction
try and buy a unit and see what's inside
okay let's go so to begin our journey
buying an abandoned storage unit we got
a u-haul van and if we don't need it
well we got a van anyway a van and
headed down to a storage auction that
was about 45 minutes away it seemed
perfect it was in the early afternoon
there were like 22 units available we
were cruising so it seems like pretty
much every single story
we talked to about this doesn't want us
to film so we're gonna come when we can
but if we can't film something we'll
just tell you guys what happened so we
got there and we signed in and then we
like waited around until 2:00 when the
auction was supposed to start and I'm
pretty sure we were the only people
there okay so I'm just gonna start in
like a 15 minutes we're gonna scarf down
our Mickey D's and then we're gonna go
try and buy a storage unit this is
happening so we walked into the main
office like right at 2:00 and the guy
like looked at us almost with a smile on
his face was like it's cancelled okay so
the auction was cancelled my theory as
to why they were cancelled is that when
Tyler signed in they saw his name and
Tyler's been calling around to different
storage units to ask if we could film
and they've all said no yeah so the guy
saw the name it was like wait a second
cancel the auction right there look I
said all for this company of all of the
auctions are canceled using up all of
the auctions are cancelled it's like for
the rest of the week I didn't roll them
specifically and then I called a couple
of other places that online said that
they were having storage auctions the
next morning and they said that they
were gonna have them so we were like
okay we'll just go tomorrow
they're abandoned no they want us to buy
them yeah why is this so hard okay good
morning it is day number two of having
this u-haul and attempt number two at
buying a storage unit for some reason
I'm wearing the same shirt as yesterday
I don't know why I did that
isn't necessarily a lucky shirt I'm
nervous because yesterday I felt like
way more ready for the auction and today
I'm just like and I buy a started unit
please what do you know aesthetic - yes
no right off the bat this one seemed a
little bit more legit there was more of
a main office and there were five or six
people already waiting there by the time
we got there so I was feeling pretty
good because it seemed like this auction
was probably going to happen okay guys
so we just signed in there seemed to be
some serious bidders yes like everyone
had tool belts multiple locks on their
belt we've heard a lot of talk about
$5,000 we've heard a lot of talk about
washing machines like people our people
are here to buy tyler kept practicing
his like bidding call I'm gonna I'm
gonna wolf when I'm at a wheel so when
we got there we thought that there was
supposed to be 14 units because that's
what it said online but then I overheard
one of the people who worked at the
storage place say that there were only
five units up for auction so we're gonna
have to really try here yes this is
actually a this is high stake a little
bit of a competition
so once the auction started everyone who
is there got into a pretty small
elevator and went up to see the first
unit so basically how this worked is
that the auctioneer cut off the lock and
then opened up the storage unit and then
everyone filed through with their
flashlights and stuff so once everyone
gets to take a look at that unit the
auction starts right away 305
so the first one was actually kind of
interesting there was a Kermit puppet
I saw a boogie board in the back a
couple of skateboards and like an army
backpack and it seemed like a few other
people were also interested I was a
little hesitant after a couple of bids
to keep going though because I didn't
want to be like the newbie who bought
the very first unit that we saw and
there was another guy who seemed like he
really wanted it so we let him get it
and he bought up for like 275 bucks and
immediately we were both like oh maybe
we should have gotten that one
so the second storage unit was just an
empty room with a few giant sets of
chests of drawers and as soon as the
auctioneer opened up the unit most
people filed by and looked in and
immediately started walking to the next
unit in fact that seems to be kind of
like the crowd dynamic at these live
storage auctions whenever they would
look inside the storage unit and not
like what was in it they would just walk
away to the next unit yeah they wouldn't
even wait for the auctioneer in the bag
please move on it sucks and if you are
someone who like doesn't mind lugging a
lot of stuff around you might hang back
and get like a less desirable storage
unit for really cheap and in fact on the
next storage unit the auctioneer opened
it and it was just like a giant pile of
clothes and almost no one wanted it and
so one guy hung back and got the whole
thing like ten dollars so after the
second and third boxes were kind of duds
I started getting kind of nervous
because there was only two left so the
auctioneer opened up the fourth storage
unit and immediately I was intrigued in
the unit was basically just like a giant
shopping cart full of comic books there
were some other things kind of like
strewn about like a lot of books some
clothes it seemed maybe a little bit of
dirt here there so I was interested
because I've heard that comic books have
some value especially if they're older
or unique or like well-preserved but
also comic books and books are easier to
carry than something like a giant chest
of drawers especially given that there
was a shopping park right there we could
just load him up and wheel him out it
seemed like some of the other buyers
were interested as well not everyone
some people walked away but a few people
hung back and kind of like got into the
bidding with us but after a couple of
bids I think they kind of just let us
have it because we seemed like we wanted
it so we ended up buying the whole unit
for
25 bucks okay so I'm walking up to our
storage unit I just paid for it it's
happening so after the option we took a
look at our unit and realized there was
a decent amount of trash on the ground
oh my god it's a little crazy in here
but I was really drawn to it because of
all these comic books look at how many
there are back there hopefully those are
collectors additional comic books is
those who want a bottom line with these
abandoned storage units you have 48
hours from when you buy it to clean it
out yeah we have to clear this thing out
so we're gonna go to Home Depot get some
garbage bags and gloves and just go to
town I'm actually really excited to get
all of our treasures out of there I am a
little bit less excited about cleaning
up the trash that's in there as well but
I know that it'll be worth living in so
something interesting about the way our
storage unit was laid out is that once
you open the door
whoever's unit it was positioned a book
called like the treasures of the tomb of
King Tut right on top of the shopping
cart it was kind of a warning like all
ye who enter here leave mine alone which
was interesting but not that terrifying
because you know it wasn't actually a
tomb or I hope it wasn't at least but
that said quickly afterwards we did find
a broken mirror on the ground this is
broken mirror yeah that's not gonna
break itself no I'm the problem and also
a mask hanging from a pipe on the
ceiling what's that
so that's a devil thing isn't it with
what seemed like a woman's bikini top
like hanging off of it I don't like that
thing I'm gonna be honest I don't think
that we should keep that so that was a
little weird but we trudged along so we
started sorting out the things that we
should save there were a decent amount
of male clothing items in there a lot of
it was workout gear but there were a
couple of pool items like an intricate
denim jacket and a Sixers Jersey
Philadelphia that's pie's favorite team
oh that I just put my head next to a
bunch of hangers mr. process I took that
as the first good omen of the
storage unit there were also a lot of
comics as we had seen before a lot of
books and also a decent amount of
mid-2000s porn I mean I can't show you
guys but there's a lot of porn I have a
theory this is like a guy that got
married so what kind of sword you
getting here you put all his porn and
his all his comic books in here just be
like that's where it is if I ever get
the divorce and come back again again oh
that's a green spears I should not take
it out but there was a lot of trash
there were some pretzels and some very
old power aids actually there were a lot
of power AIDS it was just everywhere I
spread my first bogey there something
wet the ground and I just reached into
it's like why is there food in here food
and Powerade
it's like kind of weird actually oh no
he's a string is too much for me so it
took us a couple of hours to clean the
whole unit out these are trash this is
books magazines and comics this is
clothes and that is Tyler and then we
took our bags and our shopping cart down
to the car we did however leave the
devil looking masks we told the people
in the main office that we couldn't get
him down to be fair he was wrapped
around a pipe that was hanging from the
ceiling so we were like yeah we just
can't get him so now we're gonna go home
unload clear out the trash and then
we're gonna get the comic books
appraised I think that there are
actually some serious treasures in there
I have thoroughly enjoyed this very new
experience either way but it would be
cool if we did turn a profit I mean
there's definitely possibility
okay so we just got home and we are
gonna start unpacking everything from
the van into our garage we've got a
couple boxes we're gonna like start
taking out the books and magazines and
comic books and categorizing them into
different things so we've got a lot of
sorting to do so we've got this GoPro
taped up that will hopefully record us
doing all of that yes so we'll just
fast-forward through most of it for you
guys yes so in the end our haul was one
bag of clothes a camera tripod a camera
bag a backpack a cool Jersey an
intricate denim jacket an Air Jordan hat
a box of old magazines two boxes of
books including a couple of la public
library books two boxes of comics a
shopping cart a folding chair and three
bags of garbage
looks like the power raid is leaking oh
that's nasty but from the trash Rises
the treasure I also got all these free
push pins oh my god from the floor you
have a ton in there yeah I can will be a
tap dancer okay
good first day of buying an abandoned
storage unit technically it's our second
day because we didn't have one yesterday
you're right good second day of buying
our abandoned storage units we do have
to get this stuff appraised but so far
I'm pretty pleased I already felt pretty
accomplished from just cleaning out an
old storage unit and throwing a lot of
stuff away and the shopping cart seemed
like a good find but the comic book
seemed like an obvious lead so we wanted
to go get them appraised so we have our
two full boxes of comics
I just wanted to count through them all
just to make sure I knew how many we had
this is gonna take a while okay ty so
how many did yours have about 215 same I
was 219 so we've got over 430 comics all
together so we headed to House of
Secrets which is a comic book store to
get our comics appraised and potentially
to sell them okay so we're with Paul at
a house of secrets in Burbank Paul we've
got a lot of comics I noticed that yeah
we've got gold tubs so we're just
wondering what these are worth and if
you want any of them now Paul who is a
comic book expert took one look at our
pile and immediately said that he wasn't
very hopeful just looking at them
we 90 stuff late many stuff there's a
few bucks from this period that do have
some value
that's very few unfortunately yet you
have one right on top here that's by the
20 L book the mid 90s of a kind of the
comic book explosion and as you can see
everybody put him in a bag on board so
all of them usually in a fairly great
shape so you might have a few in here
from this time period or you know maybe
five to ten dollar book so you're not
gonna find a spider-man lawn or a tent
that no a book or anything like that
a twenty dollar book is pretty good so
we're just gonna have to go through them
all unfortunately that's about the other
way yeah everything you gotta go through
the conditioning of it these are the
ones that Paul likes and then these are
the ones that Paul doesn't like as much
it's not that they're bad it's just they
don't really have much of a value to be
on this video they could still be good
reads we don't know that's what they're
there for
so what effects the value of a comic
book the most condition the big killer
for account books is water damage think
about all that power 'if you open the
storage and there's a shopping cart full
of these things yeah yeah yeah shopping
car shopping
I think a little shopping card shopping
coach probably worth more liquor so from
what Paul said most of our haul he would
put in his like dollar book pile and the
Batman ones he would sell for between
like ten and thirty bucks so if we had a
comic book store we could maybe have me
like 300 bucks off of our haul but given
that we were the middlemen in this
situation we sold our comic books for a
hundred and ten bucks so we can scrounge
up 15 bucks from someone else and we're
breaking even
you can probably keep the two boxes and
get 5 bucks apiece for those what about
the shopping cart oh I've seen the
shopping cart you got your money back oh
yeah
awesome thank you thank you so much I
don't think you want that hand this desk
I think a big variable that we were
learning very quickly is that we didn't
have an easy way to sell any of this
stuff
short of opening our own antique store
we would have to clean prep list sell
and ship every individual item on eBay
or something so we decided to donate the
clothes that we kept the sixers jersey
and the denim jacket because they're
pretty cool and we returned the library
books we've got a few
martial arts Michael Jordan and then
we've gots an atlas of holy places and
sacred sites we also have a this thing
about reefs I just want to find a book
drop and deposit it because I don't want
to get charged for whatever late fees
have incurred it's the last one I
actually feel pretty happy yes
Oh returned them and then we kept the
shopping cart as well as the folding
chair in the tripod so basically if we
say that we paid fifteen bucks for a
shopping cart a Sixers jersey a tripod a
bunch of vintage magazines and a little
bit of pouring from the mid-2000s and a
couple other bags and jackets and this
chair then we broken even but it's not
just about like getting all of our
money's worth it's also about you know
having the experience and we can keep a
couple of mementos from it actually we
looked a little bit into the market
price for shopping carts and they can go
for over a hundred bucks so we could
definitely sell ours but I think this
could come in handy down the road oh and
all I'm very glad that we did this it
doesn't look like buying abandoned
storage units is gonna be that
profitable of a venture for us unless we
really commit and like open up an
antique store or something I will say
though that I got a very good adrenaline
rush from the auction so this does make
me want to go and participate in more
live auctions well I just I want to go
in and bade own stuff just have some
good healthy competition with other
buyers get in there just get in there in
terms of storage units though I'm open
to getting another one maybe not in the
near future but like if the time was
right there's just a lot of cleaning
involved and I think in fact that's why
people abandon them in the first place
cuz they're like I just don't want to
have to clean this storage unit and I
also didn't love encountering unknown
devil masks or broken mirrors or
threatening King Tut books but you know
the porn was okay thank you guys so much
