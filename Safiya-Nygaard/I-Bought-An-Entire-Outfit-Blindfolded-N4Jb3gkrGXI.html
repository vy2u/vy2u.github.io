video today I'm going to be buying an
entire new outfit blindfolded so I was
thinking that whenever I shop I
definitely go for the same type of thing
over and over again with shape and also
definitely with color I may have a
problem so la was curious if I used my
other senses to pick out an outfit would
I end up with something new now I'm
gonna be building the outfit item by
item trying to make a cohesive look
based on what I think I have then after
I've gotten all my stuff I'm gonna wear
it around for an entire day no matter
what it is all right so let's see what
destiny has in store for me today at the
store let's go to the store store ok so
we're here in Coles they graciously let
us film here because we had to ask
someone to film cuz um not that we're
discreet usually but I do have a giant
GoPro on my head and I'm about to be
completely blindfolded so I'm gonna
start off my outfit search looking for a
top gonna feel through a few options see
what I like or what I think I like and
then build off of my inspiration from
what I think the top is so in addition
to the top I'm looking for for other
things a bottom of some kind maybe a
jacket some type of accessory and some
shoes I want a blind pulled up yeah I'm
gonna turn you around oh well I'm really
blindfolded ready yeah I'm not gonna
spin you don't disorient me too much Oh
No is there a wall no not mark oh oh oh
I feel things oh oh
why'd you let me give you hot and cold
as you're getting closer to uh tops I
mean all cold clock display you're
supposed to tell me I'm trying to figure
out what I can say oh these feel like
pants or tell some type of bottom yeah
this is something that's like a skirt or
something oh no no wait this is a top
here's a neck hole and here arm holes it
feels like denim it's it like add
roughly denim sleeveless top this is an
interesting idea I feel like you could
maybe build off like a brick
just in VMI's look from this where you
just go all denim
should I keep options in my in the crook
of my arm and then keep going I think
you should alright
oh my god okay that's that's a broad oh
I feel like I'm going into something new
this is a rack yeah these are pants
these are too long no yeah that's pants
that's pants for sure we're not on the
pants yet all right sighs oh I'm in a
sea of nothing oh oh oh this is the top
this feels like a camisole with like
some lace on the front it's got kind of
a scoop neck is having open back no I
like that I'm gonna keep this as an
option what do you think I can't tell
you good that was a test
oh no uh-oh hi Tyler
is this Tyler yeah oh is that your bicep
yeah hi I'm going this way
I feel like I'm in like a little cave
I'm coming out is this a mannequin am i
holding a mannequins hand that is not my
bicep now tell me if I'm about to knock
something alive great oh this feels like
a top with shoulder pads for some reason
the color emerald green has come to me
emerald green you think that that's the
color yeah is it green are you belonging
Island medium is it green oh I'm gonna
choose between these three options I
think I like the way this denim top
feels maybe it'd be fun to do a denim
top and like a something else on the
bottom so it's like almost like an
upside down outfit like jeans and a top
but it's actually jeans in a bottom you
really explore your creativity right now
I got a lot of time to think back here
this top I like I feel like it's a kind
of a camisole top
I definitely feel some type of lace or
like overlay it almost feels like maybe
like a sheer thing with like a little
bit of a slip material underneath oh I'm
stuck they're stuck together I was doing
so well
and then this one was sort of like I was
just I was lost for a while and then I
was found these two are my top
frontrunners I think I'm gonna go with
the camisole and then we're gonna try
and find the rest the outfit based
around this top let's see what happens
from there stuff right now you're sort
of a hazard in the store so if you're
gonna walk into anything on this a
danger and that just means stop okay
okay
so that's our new eyes or that's our new
safe word oh oh is this the same thing I
was just feeling you're just holding
that thing I feel like I've been
traveling for years but I really moved a
foot you have to
spun in a circle these feel good these
feel like denim to me yes they do let me
see where the crotch is oh yeah this is
like a high-rise Jean and then kind of
like goes down almost like cropped a
little bit like a little ankle action
I'm gonna hold these jeans as an option
because I was thinking of denim but it
was so close to the other thing I want
to see what else is out you got to
really prove your options here look oh
here's something these feel like power
suit bottoms Oh do these snap off are
these snap off pants oh oh I don't know
if these would go with my lacy top but
this is so fun are these blue I can't
tell you I really like these snaps the
denim is the safest choice but I'm torn
this is how I feel you know what we're
probably only ever gonna do this one so
let's go for the snaps Yolo when's the
last time anyone said Yolo huh I think
that's my top and my bottoms right it
might be yeah well did I get the right
ones at least like the right way okay
great so I want like a top like a jacket
I'm gonna let my hearts choose the next
direction so I'm gonna just walk
indiscriminately and just stop listening
to Tyler because I think I've literally
been shopping in like a 4-foot radius so
I'm gonna try and venture into the world
oh yeah that's just where it's right
where you were no wait hello smell is
bringing me nowhere should I try
echolocation oh well I didn't notice
there's a giant thing right here that
was one of your finest moments on the
Internet no now you're wandering out
you're like oh I'm wandering out into
the world oh no that's no good
oh what's this that feels like a sweater
is it open on either side oh if I had
picked the jeans I feel like this would
go really well because you could like
tie it around the waist with my snap
pants it's kind of bringing in like a
completely different element but I'm
gonna keep this as an option just in
case we can't find anything else with
you again alright you can go
Oh Oh were you doing near the entrance
owner you almost walked out oh it's like
bye
oh here's something this is like a
little open cardigan oh there's a hood
though that's fun I prefer this one
already because of the hood I'm gonna
try to get you back to a place that you
can stand oh oh oh
this is sheer it's almost like a wrap
sweater this is an interesting idea
based on what I'm feeling I want to
eliminate the first one I don't like the
cable-knit or maybe it's not cable knit
oh that's my camisole yeah I don't want
this one anymore goodbye sir
so what I have left is like this like
longer cardigan or open-front sweater
with a hood in the back and then this
thing which feels like a sheer overlay
situation with like a wrap in the front
almost like kimono style I think I'm
gonna go for this one because this one
feels interesting this one feels like
maybe it could go with the camisole so
I've got my camisole top my snap-off
bottoms and then this sort of like what
I think is a sheer overlay top so we're
gonna head over to the jewelry section
or rack so I'm gonna kneel help getting
there but once I get there I'm just
gonna feel around and see what we need
somehow you walked right through the
jewelry thing and did not feel any of it
really is it here is it oh this is it
oh all right here we got some jewelry oh
I feel I think a choker already your
first reach this feels like a different
choker set are they playing oh no
there's like a little pendant on the
front I like this
oh but may have I took the cat with me I
have the book right I'm gonna need no oh
no I'm on the edge of disaster area what
do you hear that to me oh yeah I need
help yeah here you go Mayday Mayday I
really like the one with the pendant on
it I think we're gonna go with it I
don't think I can find any other ones
without completely destroying this
display oh no they're dropping no no no
no so I'm gonna go with these chokers
that have it feels like a little pendant
at the front like little leather chokers
I think it'll go well yeah you're
holding up backwards right now I think
it'll go well all right so um shoes take
me to the promised land that's me you
just watching the camera apparently the
shoes are very far away so Tyler's gonna
guide me by hand hopefully this time
hold my hand damn it take me there
let's go I got my stuff this is a little
romantic tie it really isn't but you
just can't see
okay so we're in shoes I've already
started feeling around this feels like a
velvet slide with some type of
embroidery think that is a cat these
feel like some sandals we kind of got
like a big toe cross strap and then like
a middle strap this could work baby no
this is a sneaker I think as a sneaker
oh it feels like another sandal this is
interesting to me because of this like
almost like ankle strap I like that idea
I can't remember if my pants are cropped
or not though oh no they're pretty
full-length so maybe not those ones that
have like an ankle details oh is it a
mule that confuses me I'm gonna go back
around I think the big toe emphasizing
sandal will be the best these ones I
choose these I'm almost feeling like a
loungy vibe like it's kind of like a
loose pant that snaps off kimono top
wrap it's like I'm almost like boho so I
think I have my whole outfit in my hands
right now so I'm gonna head to the
dressing room try and put it on
blindfolded and then we'll all have a
reveal together I'll walk out I'll see
it you'll see it we'll all see it I'm
excited so I'm gonna keep my blindfold
on and put the outfit on and then we'll
see what it looks like that's gonna be
an adventure in its own right I think I
was right I feel very loungy you look
comfortable I feel comfort of wearing
pajamas all right ready yes one two
three oh it's all black that is your
success up it's like I have ESPN or
something yes B it's a Mean Girls
reference duh I don't know if it's like
all great together although it does kind
of give me like flamenco vibes your
enemy like don't I feel like a flamenco
dancer so I think it's for something
about the snaps and this the pants are
really cool I'm glad that they fit I
thought that the snaps might go all the
way up I think I was feeling like
further down when I would thought it was
like up by the thigh I love it I chose
these sandals that are essentially just
like Birkenstocks the jacket I think is
most outside of what I would usually
wear yeah that's I think where I'm
getting the like dance teacher vibes
almost like a ballet teacher I'm totally
shocked I one might even say
flabbergasted
why because I literally chose an
all-black outfit it's where my chokers
oh these are fun look at the mint green
maybe the mint green will provide some
some pop of color this could have gone
much worse I thought that you know
wearing it for a day would be more of a
challenge this is gonna be like a pretty
comfortable day alright let's take it so
we're gonna check out but before we do
I'm just gonna see what I could have
picked also I have no idea where I'm
going even though I've been walking
around here but I do recognize these
metal bars this this is this oh it was
black - oh yeah that's a damn top you
could've chosen this is the white shirt
that you thought was green are you sure
yes this is the church this is the one
you were adamant was green are you sure
it wasn't this one no so these are the
jeans oh oh these jeans are really cool
I have to listen to the fates the fates
have told me not to get these jeans
alright I've got my hull ready to go
ready to wear this outfit that fate has
brought me it's all black which really
says something dressed to depress so
this is my blindfolded outfit so I'm
gonna wear this out today the only issue
is that it's gonna be a little bit hot
because it's a little hot outside but
besides that I think I'm just gonna look
comfortable and everyone's gonna see my
calves which are a little stubbly my
general take on the outfit is that while
walking around no one would have guessed
that I chose it while blindfolded I
don't think anyone can really tell that
I'm doing anything you know I don't look
that weird I feel like people think that
maybe I just like fancy things it may
not be my perfect outfit but I think it
actually works decently well together I
think I like my camisole the best I
think that you know they can work well
with other types of things maybe tucked
in this top I'm not exactly sure when I
shall wear it but it is kind of like a a
wrap for like a date
so Tyler you want to go somewhere a
little chilly but not too cold let me
know the pants I also like I like
wearing them like with the snaps
so you see a little bit of my stubbly
calf as I walk about but maybe they
would entirely snap off but half snaps
are opens I just wish I could just pull
them off with one fell swoop you know
just the shoes looked almost exactly
like I thought they would look when I
felt them and then the chokers are hard
to go wrong with they're just you know
cute jokers I definitely would wear all
of these things separately again and I
do like all of them together I do look a
little bit like I'm wearing like
high-end pajamas but separately I could
see them working into like more everyday
type outfits I don't know if fate
brought me to the perfect outfit but it
brought me to something and it wasn't
that bad
