hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be buying an
entire outfit from Instagram sponsored
posts that appear on my feed so I've
bought stuff from Instagram and other
social media sites before to test their
ad algorithms to see how well they
really know me and if the products shown
in their ads are any good because
oftentimes the ads are for companies
that seem kind of cool but that I've
never heard of before so this time I
decided to focus specifically on
clothing to test whether instagrams
algorithm given what they know about me
can take these new brands and give me
recommendations that I might like so I'm
gonna buy the first clothing items in
each category that I can find on my
Instagram I follow a lot of makeup and
clothing brands already so they do have
some information about what I like style
wise my ads are served pretty sparingly
so it'll probably take me a couple of
weeks to buy the entire outfit I've also
noticed that Instagram ads can be pretty
expensive so I'm gonna cap each item at
a hundred dollars all right let's start
hunting so I haven't found any clothing
and yet sadly my ad today was for lip
gloss but I wanted to show you guys what
Instagram says about like how they serve
ads to people and they basically say
that they use information about what you
do on Instagram and Facebook their
parent company and on third-party sites
and apps so besides the information that
they already have about you based on who
you follow and what you like they also
follow you around the internet a little
bit so they have like what you give them
voluntarily and what they watch you also
do so we'll see how the clothing is and
if they've been watching correctly okay
so I found an Instagram ad for bottom's
this is a revised denim ad it seems like
they are Gene's mostly jeans and shorts
and it looks like their signature look
is an embroidered star on the butt and
not a small one almost like a
large star encompassing the entire booty
area ah see here we go
they have like a 90s edit an 80s edit
Wow and the 70s edit okay I like this
Venus edit thing though because it looks
like it's got kind of like the star but
happening they showed me a star but I
want to star but oh it's not cheap in
fact I would say it's expensive but it's
not as expensive as other clothing items
I've seen on Instagram ads so I think
that we should go for it so let's get
these oh I got a 20% off coupon when I
added it to the cart so now it's $70
which is still expensive but at least we
got a discount yeah I wouldn't
necessarily say that the jeans
advertised by revite stenum are like
definitely my style I don't wear a lot
of like light wash flare jeans but I
feel like there are a few reasons why
they might have chosen me to show this
ad to firstly I've bought a few odd
denim items in the last year so maybe
I've been tagged as a strange denim
buyer and interestingly enough Reve ice
also categorizes a lot of its styles by
decade and I have done a lot of decade
fashion research so maybe they've just
seen me searching for like 1977 JC
Penney's catalogs and they're like ooh
try this company maybe okay so I found
this Instagram ad late last night when I
was like in bed like completely in the
darkness it's just like the light of my
phone luma in my face you know front
camera Inc and I got so nervous that it
was gonna go away by the morning that I
just bought it and then I screenshotted
everything so I got this shirt from life
clothing company there seemed to be a
lot of different shirts they're kind of
like retro graphic tees or like retro
vibe graphic tees so I got this ocean's
mouth elevado teeth because that was the
one that was like first advertised to me
shipping was only five bucks but the
shirt was $45 so even though it meets
our criteria of being under a hundred it
is a pricey tee I would say that this
t-shirt is somewhat my style in terms of
why Instagram might think that I would
like this I probably hit a lot of their
target demographic checkmarks like I'm a
young adult female who lives in
California
so I can wear a t-shirt pretty much like
any time of the year and also we're
currently editing this video and Tyler
just remembered that he was searching
70s band tees or 70s graphic tees a lot
like in early October when we bought
this for the 1977 video lots of Sex
Pistols t-shirts I was looking at I mean
listen if that's where they got it from
they did get that right that isn't
necessarily my style but it is what we
make videos about that is true since
buying this t-shirt I've also seen more
ads for the same company on my Instagram
feed as well as for revise the jeans
company so I guess that's Instagram
taking the safe bet that I'll like stuff
that I already bought all right so after
days of just finding like over $200 per
item ads on Instagram I swear Instagram
thinks I'm just like a big spender cuz
they like keep showing me things where
they're like oh like come see I'm
designer jacket silent clicking it'll be
like $700 I'm like but I did find today
from this ad for Moonstar Planet
earrings which I actually think are
adorable and I checked and they're only
like 24 bucks so good price range cute
earrings it's kind of like up my alley
you know it's like dark nighttime the
moon's out the werewolf's are Howland Oh
seems like the reviews are not great but
this is one of the first like clothing
slash outfit ads I've gotten in a while
that's not wildly expensive so I think
that we have to get it I think that
instagrams ad-serving algorithm really
nailed the kind of like witchy nighttime
lady of the night
vibe which I do think matches a lot of
the clothing brands that I already
follow on Instagram so if they take that
into account they did a pretty good job
matching me with this ad okay so it's
about midnight we are actually about to
go to bed but I did finally find an ad
for shoes that weren't like over $200 so
these are the shoes that we're gonna get
these are from ModCloth they're like um
boots that seem to have like fake
zippers on the side so this is the
casual influenced boot in Cognac looks
like they don't have my size in this
color but let's try black
don't have my size are black let's try
you are they do have my size in war I
don't mind I'm fine with more so let's
get these anymore so shoes a chick I
think that these boots are somewhat my
style I mean they're sort of neutral
colored ankle booties so it's pretty
tough to like be offensive to someone
style unless you're like really against
closed toed shoes ModCloth is a company
that I've heard of before though I don't
usually shop there but if I had to guess
why Instagram preferred this to me I
think it's because of the price it might
have noticed me clicking on a bunch of
ads but not buying any of the really
expensive ones and I think Instagram
whether or not they think this is my
style is probably like hey you might
like this price and we want to make a
sale so look at him all right so it's
1:18 in the morning I was just scrolling
down my Instagram pretty far just trying
to find a jacket just because it's been
probably a week since I ordered anything
else there's been a couple of jackets
that I've seen that once I like go back
to try and buy them they're not there
anymore like I literally like to be like
oh I should go record this and then it's
like Reese or did buy the algorithm and
it's just gone so I'm not taking any
chances this time this is for straight
to hell apparel which is actually a
clothing account that I already follow
but this specific post is sponsored so I
wonder if they bought a sponsored post
like a pair to people who already follow
them or if I'm just like in their
demographic for their ad that they
bought on this ad there are a few
different jackets for men and for women
the first female jacket is this velvet
looking jacket which when I click SHOP
NOW says it is the Jackson jacket for 85
bucks which seems to be up my alley
around the right price point and still
here so let's get it
I think this jacket is definitely in my
style arena because it's from a brand
that I already follow and I feel kind of
bad that they like wasted their ad
dollars on me since I already follow
them it kind of reminds me how on
facebook I'm often prompted to spend
like five or ten dollars to boost a post
from my facebook page and it's always
unclear whether those more people seeing
it
our people who already follow me or just
new people but either way we got the
jacket and completed purchasing our
Instagram ad outfit
I'm excited honestly it's been a long
time coming months in the making it's
been a couple months in the making of
cultivating ads okay so we finally have
the entire Instagram at outfit here I'm
pretty sure we got the jeans first so
let's start with our revised denim jeans
so these jeans were probably the most
troublesome item of the bunch about a
month after I purchased them I tried to
like check in on them and see where they
were just because I felt like that was a
reasonable amount of time for me to
expect them within and USPS told me that
they were lost they couldn't find them
and that my tracking number was just
nonsense and then I tried to contact the
revised denim company and heard nothing
back from them and mysteriously a week
later the jeans appeared so I don't know
what happened or how they even got here
to be honest but by some carrier they
were delivered in about six weeks in
general I would say they have like sort
of that vintage vibe that they were
going for there is in fact a star across
my booty I don't know if it's a super
flattering star but it's definitely
attention-grabbing
in general I do think I like these jeans
but I don't think I would recommend
these just because of the shipping
calamity that I went through and they're
also kind of expensive for how much at
least I would wear these jeans they're
sort of like one-off fun interesting
pants they're not really like your
everyday go-to pair of jeans unless you
want a star on your butt every day which
maybe you do so next up we have this
always the graphic tee from life
clothing company I'd say it got here in
a pretty decent amount of time and it
seems to be what was advertised I do
like that on the tag it says Made in Los
Angeles I feel like I should have gotten
it quicker if it if it's from here it
did take a couple of weeks to get to me
okay so this is it on it kind of reminds
me of the mouth from the whale in
Pinocchio and also that like famous like
Japanese wood art is it wood art like
the wave I know you're talking about but
I do think this shirt is like a little
bit
for what it is it is a nice feeling
shirt feel it it's quite soft
sorry go set your boob oh it's nice yeah
but I think that for like a graphic tee
it's a little expensive next up we have
our straight to hell apparel jacket kind
of looks like a coffin it's velvet on
the outside and satin on the inside or a
horse of some kind or like a that's all
I got
coffin hearse I don't know that's it
alright so this is the jacket on my body
I really like this jacket honestly it's
kind of got like a cool velvet moto 80s
feel and there's a lot of blue diamonds
and triangles and shapes
yeah I'm pointing in many different
directions though I do really enjoy this
jacket and the company that it comes
from I do feel like a little bit bad
that they spent money to show an ad to
someone who already follows them it's
like what's the point of paying to reach
your own followers you know hopefully
you post to reach your followers
hopefully and then up next are these
black boots from ModCloth they seem to
be pretty normal-looking booties I'm
pretty sure these zippers are decorative
I don't know if I could actually zip
them up I would say every other item in
the outfit is pretty styled or like has
a feel or a vibe and I would say these
boots are more like whatever you want to
make up them - the decorative zipper
which you cannot zip so if you wanted
them to be zipped up you're out of luck
so ModCloth is a company that I've known
about for a pretty long time so this
purchase is not really like a trying out
a new and like untested company vibe but
it's more like wow these are the only
shoes under $150 on Instagram that I
could find over the course of like two
months they're like are you tired of
expensive ads buy $60 boots and I'm like
that sounds great and then last but not
least are the planetary earrings as a
finishing touch to the outfit I don't
necessarily think that these earrings
like bring everything together but stars
are heavily featured so I've got stars
on the lobes and stars on the buttocks I
really really like these earrings I feel
like they're kind of asymmetric
interesting celestial I don't know what
this is but I'm feeling it
so I feel like I like the style found a
new company that I like and I didn't
mind the price
a little moon in the nighttime sky of my
sideburns alright so this is my entire
Instagram ad outfit if I had to
characterize how Instagram wants me to
dress I would say it's kind of like a
muted color palette and a faux vintage
II feel I would say I kind of feel like
Donna from that 70s show there's a
little bit of like an urban cowboy vibe
but I think my main vibe is like 70s
semi tomboy individually I don't
strongly dislike any of these items and
I think they're all in a range of
something I might wear which is cool but
I think the only things I would buy of
my own accord without the video would be
the earrings and maybe the jacket it's a
bottle cap opener that's gonna come in
handy in terms of how personalized the
recommendations were I have a suspicion
that they were looking at some of the
things I was searching for on other
platforms and besides that ones I bought
from some companies they did show me
those ads again so all in all there was
probably some level of personalization
but I feel like if they're gonna be
following me around the internet and
also potentially looking at me through a
webcam the ads could probably be a
little bit more specific I mean if
you're gonna spy you know maybe give me
a better ads or don't spy just choose
one or the other probably thank you guys
