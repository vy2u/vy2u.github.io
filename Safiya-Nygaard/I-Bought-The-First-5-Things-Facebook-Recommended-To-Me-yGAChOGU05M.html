video today I'm going to be ordering the
things that Facebook thinks that I want
so I'm going to be getting the first
five things that are referred to me in
my newsfeed I'm talking about the
sponsored posts that appear in your feed
that are suggested to you via the sable
thang book algorithm which in theory
should be things that I want because of
all the information Facebook has about
me from the last ten years I've been on
Facebook since October of 2006 back then
it was a lot of writing on each other's
walls there was a lot of Facebook
stalking which is I think something that
doesn't happen as much these days
Facebook to me currently is like where I
go to check my facebook Messenger I
still use basic messenger a lot a place
that I go to scroll through my newsfeed
sort of to see what people are up to but
also kind of just to scroll and even
though I don't post that regularly
anymore I still have a lot of friends on
Facebook who do and presumably Facebook
knows what my demographic like it's kind
of like we see which pages you visit we
see who your friends are we see what
your general interests are so these are
the products you might like I never
bought anything from a Facebook ad
before I've never really clicked on one
either
I don't actively go to Facebook to want
shopping referral so when it pops up I'm
kind of like no thanks I'd rather get
convinced to click on this slideshow of
what the Catholic Full House looks like
now so my goal today is to see if I
actually want the things that Facebook
wants me to buy I don't want to spend
too much more than 25 bucks per items
maybe 30 if it's like really good but
like 25 bucks is my target price per
item so let's see what they have in
store for me today in store for me today
because I'm shopping all right
ah okay here we go Walt personalized
perfume let's click on this I'm taking a
quiz on wall comm they really they
pulled me in I think I want a unisex
scent fresh sexy elegant bags just let
her go with jasmine citrus and ocean
serve later okay I got to name my
fragrance I'm calling it soft face it's
a hundred bucks oh hell no a hundred
bucks no way um sorry walked all right
I'm keepin scrolling I'm trying to see
now this
interesting this is a sponsored post by
this company called third love it's a
braw company and I've seen this thing
all over my facebook page we're taking a
quick quiz about a bra and then they're
going to recommend me a bra probably
which breast shape is closest to yours a
symmetric bell-shaped relaxed east-west
let's go with slender which cup is more
your style push-up what size is your
favorite bra 30 to be your recommended
style and size is the 24/7 classic
t-shirt bra in 32 B pay $2.99 for
shipping love the bra keep it for 70 70
bucks and you can return it if you don't
like it because the current price is
$2.99 for shipping I think that this
falls into the purview of our rule 70
bucks is kind of cheeky for me but if
it's the best bra ever as this this
thing says it is and maybe it's worth it
so we'll see and Facebook thinks I'm
going to like it so so the next concert
post is this thing called sustain it
says listen up vaginas are the most
absorbent part of your body noted so
what you put in them matters
I agree so I seem that we're going to be
buying some organic condoms alright
alright Facebook up good you know safe
sex safe
organic sex rubber up for Facebook why
not
14 bucks who are a pack of 10 I'm not
going to get a subscription let's get it
one pack of condoms Thank You Facebook
okay let's keep going let's keep going
here is the next sponsored post is from
a company called cute nutrition save 25%
on our bundles today
what are they bundle what are they
talking about twelve guilt-free
chocolate snack bars that could be fun
detox cleanse antioxidant boost Facebook
wheels it I will get cute guilt-free
chocolate bars for $15 an 81 cents all
right completing checkout I just think I
bought twelve chocolate bars for a lot
of money but let's see this next thing
is stitch fix all right stitch fix let's
see what you're up to
okay so it's basically like a curated
like style box they send you a box full
of clothes and accessories and then you
decide what you want to
said to back the rest and then pay for
what you end up keeping all right let's
see how expensive this thing is before I
do an entire quiz like I did for the
waft perfusing did the entire quiz just
to figure out that it was $100 we're
glad to take the whole quiz see they go
size fit cut style price I'm just
filling out all my sizes I'm 200 font I
sometimes I'll flaunt my arms
cleavage I don't have any there's no
option for I don't have any cleavage
what do you think of the styles below I
like this one okay is kind of shiny for
my taste but I'll say I like it okay so
now I'm saying price so I'm saying
everything the cheaper the better they
charge you $20 for a silence video for
setting the box so that's my 20 bucks
right so far I've gotten four things and
two of them are you can get this for not
that much money but if you keep it you
have to buy it so it's kind of like
sending you things by trial basis which
is kind of smart because maybe you're
banking on the fact that people just
don't want to go to the post office in
return it oh my god okay
there's another bra company what is it
about Facebook they think I need bras
everywhere this is true in Ko actually
one of my really good friends likes this
company so maybe this is actually a good
one true and cone lingerie okay so this
is lingerie okay I don't think there's a
single thing here that's going to be in
my rule of under 25 bucks maybe like a
nice panty ooh how about the best waist
song ever okay so it's a one size fit
all sixteen bucks
Wow good thing that I only got one pair
of legs panties because this was an $8
shipping fee so that was a $25 pair of
panties so I got the third love bra the
cute nutrition chocolate bars the
sustain natural organic condoms the
stitch fix style box and the true and co
best song ever those are my five things
of these things the things that I would
click on independently probably the
third love bra and a true and colon
jerae
so far I think that Facebook things that
I love breasts and I want to sign up for
newsletters and take quizzes
only one of those things is true let's
wait until they get here and then we'll
try one so it's been a couple of weeks
and I think I finally have all the
packages here with me so this is the
true in Ko I think this is the song I
ordered so let's start with
oh yeah here it is
I mean it looks quite sexy I like it I
think Facebook really hit the nail on
the head with this one I really like
this style of their other items of
course the challenge of this video was I
wasn't going to buy anything over like
20 bucks so the song is what we went
with but I really do like some of these
more like strappy bras they've got going
on I'm going to go slip this on really
quick alright I'm back so the one size
fits all seems to be working for me it
fits quite nicely I do like how soft it
is but weirdly the like but string is a
little bit wider than my usual songs but
string so I'm definitely like getting
used to it a little bit I think it any
it's a pretty good song I do like it so
the next item is this stuff guilt-free
chocolate snack bars high in vitamins
high in proteins okay so these aren't
just guilt-free chocolate bars these are
actually vitamin note it I don't think I
understood that it kind of tastes like a
tootsie roll it tastes like a tootsie
roll power bar dipped in chocolate all
these things are gamers they do have a
pretty strong twisty roll vibe I can
only assume that the reason that I got
referred these things is that I like
pages that then meet Kardashian and
bachelor content and so this to me
reminds me so much of a product that
would be on one of their instagrams
either a bachelor contestant or a
Kardashian so you're building pleasure
media has caught up to you is that
chocolate bars okay or people like
Jonathan that's just a series oh stop
chocolate series okay so the next thing
is my Skitch fix box oh hello
okay oh this is cute it's like a white
and black stripes off the shoulder top
would one call this like a Brigitte
Bardot you know like a boatneck but I
actually really do like this top I kind
of lost them like high-waisted medium
wash jeans and some ballet flats okay
next is this black tunic top which kind
of like ladder cutouts in the back the
open back is pretty open air I do like
the tunic though well I love
three-quarter sleeve I'm into it I like
it it's a comfy this next thing is a
blue floral dress I like to cut
I am a fan of Gator dresses like the
a-line so this is the dress it
unexpectedly has cold shoulder cutout
it's a cute dress but there is kind of a
lot going on and it's not really my
style but I do like the other two tops I
tried on so far let's see what's next
this pair of burgundy pants they're not
really pissed they're just kind of like
fake leggings that have the fake or
anything the real pockets whoa
I do like them on one issue and probably
the reason that I went along she's mean
is that they're a little bit short and
they're not quite tight enough around
the bottom for me to really get away
with it I do like the color we're coming
on to color to like vampiric there's a
little box in here I think of
accessories abandon that's it ooh okay
so we saved choker said oh I like it I
think it's cute
I like this that like top silver band
it's a little bit loose but I do like it
as is so I'll have five things from this
dish pick box I really do love three of
them that's a pretty good batting
average three out of five
obviously these items were given to me
by stitch fix not my facebook itself but
you know Facebook referred me to this
company
I wonder if Facebook knows that I get
beauty boxes and they're like try style
boxes so this next thing is this bra
from third love Facebook kept referring
me to bra and lingerie companies so I
know this my peers or my friends who are
just liking or buying lingerie from
Facebook all the time or if they're just
like soft you need a new bra usually I
go for a brawl with a little bit of
padding but this classic t-shirt bra is
what they're quiz recommended for me
cool so I'm going to put this bad boy on
first impression is that the cups are
incredibly soft and actually do feel
really nice I don't really understand
why the straps have ruffles here if
you're wearing like a slim fitting
t-shirt and you could see the ruffles of
a shirt it would just be like what are
those I don't think it's smashing my
boobs down but I do like to have a
little bit of push up it's a very
comfortable cup but I don't think that
it's like perfect and I think that for
that price I really want to be getting
like the perfect bra for me all right so
the last thing is this box I think this
must be the natural
condoms it's from this company called
sustain do what's natural
it is pretty discreet you know not to
like condom it's like condom and then
they also sent me a little I think a
sample of blue I'm not going to try
these on or ask anyone else to try these
on but let's see what they look like
inside oh look there's like a little
bamboo print on the front I will say
that I'm down for the cause like I think
it's important to be promoting safe sex
and like you know instruments to assist
that quest but I do think that this was
kind of random to be on my newsfeed
these condoms were a little bit pricey
if I recall correctly but they are
natural which is cool and it does save
you that awkward interaction in store if
you don't like that maybe buying condoms
from Facebook could be for you okay so
that was my haul from Facebook I
actually will say that I was pleasantly
surprised at how much I liked most of
that stuff I did really like the style
box the song that I'm still wearing
quite comfortable I actually don't think
that these things were specifically
personalized towards me at the person I
think these were just more generally
targeted towards a young woman in her
early to mid 20s who has friends who may
like these things but I do think that
some of the stuff I got I genuinely do
like and I will keep so I think that
Facebook does a decent job matching me
to companies that are doing some cool
stuff I do think there are some gimmicks
involved quizzes sending you stuff for
the price of shipping and then if you
like it you can keep it and then buy it
then or return it and that kind of stuff
so I think that they're definitely
trying to stand out on the newsfeed and
then when once they get you they're
trying to keep you I think that your
facebook speeds could be a good place to
find out about a new company that you
might not know about but I actually
think it's more efficient to go on to
the interwebs yourself and do your
online shopping on your own rather than
just hoping that's something that you
watch will be referred to you thank you
