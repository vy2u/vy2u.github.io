video today I'm going to be ordering the
first five things that are recommended
to me on my Instagram feed a little
while ago I did a video about ordering
the first five things that were on my
facebook newsfeed to see if facebook
knew me well enough so that the ads they
recommended to me were four things that
I was like so I thought it was an
interesting experiment and you guys
really wanted to see more so this week
I'm taking on instagrams
now I think I have a slightly different
relationship with Instagram than I do
with Facebook I think with Facebook I'm
mostly just connected to my friends from
high school and college and I have a lot
of like old pictures on there and it is
more of like a personal profile whereas
on Instagram I feel like I follow a lot
more brands like makeup and clothing
brands now of course Instagram has been
previously bought by Facebook so they're
both the same company but I do have like
different interactions on each platform
and just with an eye test
I do get slightly different ads I'm
going to go with the same set of rules
I'm going to be buying the first five
things that are in sponsored posts on my
feed that are in my budget last time I
had a budget of about 25 to 30 dollars
this time I'm going to up it a little
bit to about fifty dollars just because
of the things that I've seen on my
Instagram feed are oftentimes crazy
expensive but I also think just
generally more expensive than the things
that are advertised to me on Facebook
like I've seen some like really out
there like $400 shoes that Instagram
thinks I'm just going to casually buy
when I'm like waiting in line at Subway
the last time I was able to buy
everything at one time
but Instagram sponsored posts appear
more sporadically than Facebook's so I'm
going to be buying these things over the
next few days and then we're going to
come back and see what the haul is like
and if these things are any good okay
ordering the Instagram products let's
see what my internship hasn't
or for me okay so this is a ad for
reckless model pick up our Pogo
activewear Paul at last it looks like
it's like a legging basically like
workout leggings which I'm definitely
interested in so I do get two pairs for
45 bucks that's a good deal
healthy are good because if that's true
this is an awesome deal okay if it
wasn't I pick I picked the overdrive
leggings which are these ones and then
these are the two Swift leggings there
weren't really any like plain black ones
which is what I usually go for when it
comes to leggings but do you seem fun
okay so two pairs of leggings on the way
from ruff less girls and so to show you
guys one other thing that I saw when I
opened my feed I am currently doing a
video on me like theology custom skin
care and so I found a sponsored post for
cure ology after I had just bought
serology like two days ago on Instagram
when they show you an ad they do have a
why am I seeing this option or like an
about Instagram ads option we want to
show you ads from businesses that are
interesting and relevant to you and to
do that we use information about what
you do on Instagram and Facebook our
parent company and on third-party sites
and apps around following me around the
internet this is like probably a couple
hours later I just opened my Facebook
feed and I have wreckless girls as the
first thing on my feet they were like
wait you like this stuff come back ok so
we found another one it's from this
place called shop hush it says the
hottest makeup product 60 to 90% off
department store prices oh it's an app
okay I'll get the app sure tap to open
nothing in your cart okay where should I
get
oops dupes they do carry like brands
that I know like NYX and else I saw
there is this bundle right here it's the
perfect 10 bundle for items for $10 an
eyeshadow palette a contour and glow
palette a blender sponge and a natural
sugar lip scrub for 10 bucks I'm going
to buy this until Apple pay Wow exciting
okay don't look at that even the screen
report says 9 a.m. it is 4 p.m. and this
is my second ad of the day so I think
that they are noticing that I am
I'm clicking and they're giving me more
I don't know that's true but I feel like
you know there's some blood in the water
I'm biting this is this place called
trap Bay the caption says these girls
born in the 90s are dangerous the jacket
that was in the Instagram post is what I
buy this is called the mother-of-pearl
jacket it was 35 bucks but it is on sale
for $20 okay so I got this jacket I
scrolled really far back up and I
actually saw another sponsored post
called Dagny Dover and just from the
looks of it it looks like it's going to
be expensive let's take a look yeah it's
$400 okay so it is 2:30 a.m. we are
stuck in the line of the drive-thru at
Del Taco but I did find another
Instagram at this is of a kind it looks
like a blush a stick blush it's in
between a post that I do follow of Kat
Von D beauty and morphe brushes the
thing that they were showing me was this
baby bidi Bom Bom
while Selena referenced there so it
doesn't seem like everything is from the
same brand so maybe it's like a
compilation site this one looks like the
one that was advertised this bomb thing
I'm gonna go for bronze shimmer oh and
looks like you can put it on your your
lips - all right I'm going to buy this
right now damn 28 bucks for a bomb okay
all right sure okay guys so I have found
what I think is my last Instagram
product this is called slipcase color
your world and get into that Californian
spirit with our latest style
so thing they've got phone cases and
maybe cases or stickers for your laptop
or I'm going to click shop now all right
let's see what they've got for math
books that could be exciting so they've
got some cool floral one some cool
marble looking ones a couple that are
like galaxies Mercury's I kind of want
that okay so I'm going to get this
mercury case for 47 bucks okay and
shipping is $13 so that's a $60 MacBook
case but hopefully it's a really good
MacBook case so I have all five things
heading my way we got the leggings the
pack of makeup the jacket the bronzer /
blush and then we got this matte
bookcase I think I'm most excited about
the jacket and the legging so we'll see
how those turn out and yeah next time
you see me I'll have my haul
okay so I've got my hull here let's get
right into it let's start opening the
thing so I'm going to start with the
last thing that I got which is the
Select case macbook case here we go
I guess I thought it might be like a
little more hollow it's pretty much just
like a still image of an oil slick but
it's still pretty cool oh well you can
go straight through I'm opening it ready
ha currently my laptop is just
free-balling it like I don't have any
case on it at all I'm excited to get
some protection Oh actually when I took
the plastic off it's more matte it looks
like my computer just ran a marathon and
this is its foil wait is clean that's
off really quick there's a lot of cat
hairs on here well I'm not doing a good
job at this I think that the phone and
laptop case ad is like pretty low
hanging fruit for an Instagram or even a
Facebook or pretty much any internet ad
I think that they're assuming that
you're probably using a phone or a
computer to surf the only way that they
couldn't get you is if you're using a
desktop and so it's not like that
personalized but I do like the
aesthetics event and I do like the case
selection that they had there we go got
a whole new wardrobe doesn't add too
much weight you know so a heavy that got
me nervous I started throwing it in the
air this is the most expensive item I
got by a decent amount but you know I'm
excited about it
so great okay so this next thing is from
hush the apps in general I got a lot of
like marketplaces like they would often
direct me to sites or apps that had a
lot of different products and for shop
hush they were like do you want any of
this so I've got a sugar lip scrub a
blending sponge and then I've got it's
an eye shadow palette and another
eyeshadow palette oh it's a contour
contour and glow although the entire
something in this box smells like
strawberries and I don't know it's
definitely the sugar lip scrub wow that
smells very an berry I'm always down for
new lip scrub so I'm excited about it
my hand feels very accelerated it's a
little rough but you know it says the
sugars disappearing so it seems like a
good one next is this blending sponge
I'm always looking for dupes for Beauty
blenders so if this could be a do for
Beauty Blender I am down all right I've
got a little bit of water right here I'm
just going to dance
it oh it didn't get a lot bigger in
water and it's definitely little firm
still I'm going to just take a little
bit a BB cream with this lending sponge
and just do it on my hand
just you guys can see what it does and
so I can also see what it does actually
it doesn't feel too firm on my arm and
it seems blending out decently there you
go so next up is this butterfly
eyeshadow palette I really love the
colors that are in here I'm just going
to swatch them all on my floor I'm
really quick with my finger I'm getting
some decent some I actually I ran out of
space on my arm so this is the first two
rows they're not like incredibly
pigmented but for the price that they
are I'm like pretty impressed they do
feel nice and they definitely do feel
like pretty blendable alright and then
last in this package is this contour and
glow palette so basically it's got like
a couple shades of contour one like
light peachy color and then a few
highlighters and two like blush colors I
think the blush shades are a little bit
fainter but these highlights seem to be
doing something like they're I think
they're glowing I think they're popping
off the arm I think I would have clicked
this ad even if it weren't for the
experiment just because I would want to
see like what the type of makeup is
they're selling I think I'd probably go
back to hush and see like what else they
have maybe buy some more like one-off
stuff but the bundles especially at the
price of the bundles could be a good way
to just like try some stuff out okay so
next up is the restless girls legging
they were doing like a BOGO like a buy
one get one free so I think that I kind
of got away with murder here if if these
are good leggings I'm going to try them
the gray ones first and we'll see how
they look okay this is the first pair of
leggings don't go all the way down to
the calves there's hair there okay they
look kind of cool and then be honest I
think they're a little small I ordered a
medium medium usually a pretty safe size
for me in terms of leggings just because
like they usually stretch the waistband
is not too bad but like I think that
there is a little bit like there's this
band that goes around its kind of tight
I'm going to open this up and try on the
second pants now the side kind of
reminds me of spider-man yeah full of
spidey sense II I'm gonna be honest I
like these ones a lot more oh yeah the
waistband is a lot more comfortable
plentiful they accountant men's
underwear waistband doesn't it I like
the spidey sense thing and add some
interest makes me feel like I've been
bitten by a mutant spider totally
McGuire just kidding who the new one
Andrew garbled who know who the new one
I don't know Stoppard's not the
playwright this is one of the ads where
they showed me specifically workout
pants in the ad and so when I clicked on
it I did see that they had other things
to buy but I went for the workout pant
because that's what they tried to sell
me and I wonder why they tried to
advertise workout gear to me I don't
really follow like any fitness accounts
or anything like that like I pretty much
follow like makeup and fashion accounts
so I actually put this tank top on just
to try on with these leggings but I'm
going to keep this on to try and my next
item which I'm very excited about this
is the kind of like shiny iridescent
jacket it does smell vaguely of plastic
hmm how do I look snazzy I feel kind of
snazzy it is a little itchy but it's so
shiny you could just wear this with the
clear pants and you'd be all set
these pants are useful man we all hated
them at first but I like them now you're
so reflective this ad was really
straightforward it was just like this
jacket do you want it and I was like yes
I'm clicking on all the ads but yes I
also kind of want this jacket I
definitely think they did a good job in
terms of referring me this jacket like a
good fit from company to consumer I just
I I'm into this kind of green on look
once again if you come at me with like a
supernova girl aesthetic like I'm gonna
like it I like this jacket oh it is
issue oh it is you look like a
futuristic Danny Zuko to me I've got you
then all the time
mMmmm Joel Tyler wants everyone to know
that he was in an acapella group in
college alright so this is the last item
it must be the like multi use like
bronzer lip gloss dick thing Oh lots of
tissue paper oh my god I got a little
letter enjoy Sofia we're going to look
at handwritten they're so nice of a kind
is another one of those websites that's
like a marketplace but I wanted to get
the bomb stick because that was what was
advertised to me oh my god it smells so
good what'd it smell like your block
nose yeah it smell of it we only
eliminate lemon cake lemon and slowly
over you kind of use this as both like
bronzer for your cheeks and for your lip
can't see much of anything it feels nice
and it smells amazing alright let's try
over here Oh
what you're supposed to do it's supposed
to like have a little bit of color in it
okay so I can't get any color to show up
on my arm so I'm going to take my
lipstick off and try to put on my lips
I'm going to use my lip scrub from
earlier because I don't really get to
put it on is from the hush box this is a
sugar lip scrub okay that one's pretty
um pretty hydrating wash off or remove
with a washcloth just going to wipe it
off really so weird shape kind of and
all of this shaped like deodorant but it
does feel amazing I don't think you can
see anything though this site of a kind
has a lot of different stuff and they
did decide to show me makeup and I do
follow a decent amount of makeup
accounts on Instagram I am a fan of this
in terms of the way it feels and the way
it smells but I don't think that it is a
color okay so that is my Instagram haul
I think overall my favorite things are
probably this lip scrub I do actually
think it did quite a good job the
spider-man printed leggings and I'm
wearing right now and the Mac bookcase I
definitely think it's interesting that
overall instagram has been sending me to
places where I can like bounce around
and shop instead of like being like this
is the one item you need I don't think
that the ads were super personalized
based on which accounts I follow on
Instagram but I do think that generally
they probably get the gist of my
biographical information that they have
from Facebook and they know that I
follow like makeup and closing accounts
besides to be random wildly expensive
items I think that Instagram did a
little bit of a better job than Facebook
but that could just be the types of
companies that choose to advertise on
Instagram versus the type of companies
that choose to advertise on Facebook
maybe I'm just more of an Instagram
customer I think that I came out with a
pretty good haul my arms do itch a
little bit but my laptop is well
