friends and welcome to another video
today I'm going to be buying the first
five things that I see in snapchat ad so
I've done this before with Facebook
Instagram and YouTube ads basically just
to see how targeted or personalized ads
are on different platforms based on what
they know about me and my interest like
those other companies snapchat does have
some analytics about me personally I've
had a snapchat since probably 2012 or
2013 so I've had mine for a while I
would say my snapchat is set up most
like my facebook where I use it more
personally rather than like on my
Instagram where I literally follow
brands so I'm just curious to see what
they think I like they also say that
they share information with other
companies apparently around your email
address so we'll see what happens with
that nowadays I see ads in a few
different places you definitely see
sponsored lenses and geofilters I'm
trash and then they also have more
traditional ads between personal stories
and discover stories so we're just going
to watch everything you can and try and
find an ad okay let's do it
okay so let's open snapchat right now I
want to see if we have any sponsors
lenses I'd like that's the ad I see most
often because I go through the lenses
all the time alright let's see oh I look
like I'm a little purple koala with a
lip piercing I'm Elvis I am an elephant
usually I'll see a sponsored lens like
right at the beginning of the list of
lenses but I guess today there isn't one
okay so I'm going to take a snap and
then look through the filters just to
see if there aren't any sponsored
geofilters nearby looks like Los Angeles
Los Angeles full battery and never to
that one yeah I don't see any like
sponsored geofilters for businesses I
just don't think we're like close enough
Danny alright so let's take a look at
some of these stories I usually see ads
after my friend snapchat stories both
for watching a few I'm going to click on
my friend Chelsea story looks like
Chelsea's in Nantucket
looks like they're eating lobster
playing some beer games
oh here we go my foot now Mikoto it's an
ad for snapchat for custom geofilters I
guess we'll make a snapchat geofilter
that's our first ad it says geofilters
are perfect for any occasion when filter
started $5.99 why not alright snapchat
why not
what should the occasion be Tyler and I
were talking about this the other day we
don't know when Krusty first day is we
say it's Halloween because that's when
we first likes met him but it could be
today all right we've got some some
templates here so I like this champagne
yeah Krusty could be 21 no he's not he's
turning 16 it looks like when I click
this I just just get to like customize
the text like I don't actually get to
customize like the filter at all let me
see if I go back and I try and start
from scratch
if they let me like put in a picture of
Krusty so it looks like on this page you
just have like sort of the capabilities
that you have with like a normal
snapchat which is like adding emojis
stickers bitmoji stickers like writing
type of stuff honestly I was hoping for
more design potential like I see with a
normal geofilters but I guess this will
do none of these cats really looked like
Krusty but this one looks like Krusty to
attitude why did happy bday Krusty a
bitmoji a sticker in Academy G I'm going
to say yes to this this is my custom
geofilter I have to mark off where I
want the geofilter to go apparently
there's a minimum size I have to make it
big enough that it will cost at least
$5.99 so that is one item down Krusty's
birthday geofilter Krusty birthday is
going to be a raucous event so I hope
they're ready okay so let's get back to
the story
it looks like Christine is making tea
climbing a video with extend watch a
minute hmm tap crotch oh here's another
ad it's for Adidas it says hashtag here
to create it looks like a little mini
video about a football team they're
doing like acrobatic stuff all right so
let's swipe up and see
oh cool gold please are they doing some
back flips
what are they advertising though so when
I swipe up is just this video there's no
like specific product they don't send me
to adidas is a website they just like
made me watch the video I think this is
fair game for me to just buy anything
that I want from adidas so let's just
take a look at the women's tab and see
like what's going on in general
adidas stuff is pretty expensive but I'm
kind of nervous about the amount of ads
that we might get tonight so we're going
to get something we could get to
superstar sneakers they're kind of like
the classic looking one so I say let's
get a pair of those because that seems
like something I would legitimately wear
a lot so this is item number two so
actually as we're making this video
people are like updating their stories
so I'm just going to keep clicking with
the most recent one let's see what
Gabby's doing looks like gabby is
gyrating hello kind sir
that's tremendous oh okay here we go
the next ad is a Victoria's Secret ad
called the new sexy when I swipe up they
send me like straight to the Victoria's
Secret website the first thing they say
is the new sexy so what if I just click
on it I mean if I go push-up Oh alright
yep Scrolls all the way down to the
pushup for me oh these are cool down
here these ones down here are kind of
like bra wet so you could wear them like
underneath the sheer top snapchat can
you see me
I think the ad was specifically for the
body by Victoria bras so let's grab one
of these in a push-up style we'll see ya
it's give me some nice looks in if it
does some nice good pushing up of things
okay so that was three ads from stories
let's check out discover and see what
discover has bruh I don't watch a lot of
discover content but I know there are
ads within the discover stories
themselves
here's one from Daily Mail apparently
Rob Kardashian is out of hiding a baby
elephant got saved by jackals wait no
from jackals oh ok so here's an ad and
it's actually for snapchat spectacle
which I already own they must know that
I definitely posted to my snapchat story
before using spectacles maybe they're
like maybe you'll buy another one I
don't think I need a second pair I think
I need to you
my own pair rule hello Krusty and Tyler
okay so let's keep looking through these
discover stories to find something that
I don't already own
how about Cosmo celebs Wow hobbies
living so this is just an article about
everything apparently oh here's an ad
okay so I'm an ad for Starbucks
refreshers the one they thought in the
ad is called black cherry limeade let's
swipe up and see what they soap oh the
swiping up option is actually just my
setting I thought I would be able to
swipe up to buy it but it's actually
just anything get this part okay cool so
that is ad number four let's see if we
can't find one more add in these
discover stories okay so this is a story
for the Outside Lands Music Festival
so in this they've curated a bunch of
snaps from the festival into a single
story ah classic porta-potties whoo okay
so there was actually an ad in this
outside land story um it's for john
frieda haircare hey everybody we're
really excited to share a story with you
and your hair tops to make a statement
campaign thank you it looks like they're
recording some type of single and
somehow it has to do with John Frieda it
keeps going away so I keep atoms like
click back into it and actually the post
app for that in the story is this girl
who's brushing her hair with a flat hair
brush John Frieda music flask it's all
coming together this ad is definitely
just like an awareness campaign they
literally say like wait till our thing
comes out and then check it out so
they're not selling me anything specific
so I'm just going to go and see like
what seems to match my hair type and
we're going to try it out so that is
item number five and that means we have
all of our five items from snapchat so
we have the custom geofilter the Adidas
shoes the Victoria's Secret bra the
Starbucks refresher and the john frieda
ambiguous product I think I'm most
excited about the adidas shoes and the
Victoria's Secret bra and of course I am
excited to celebrate Krusty's 16th
birthday what better way to celebrate
them with a custom geofilter alright so
it's time for the snapchat haul I've got
all my stuff here and the krusty
geofilter is ready to be deployed so
let's get into it
so the first thing are these Adidas
shoes now I'm not sure exactly what
inspired snapchat to gives me this ad it
was like just like dyes doing tricks
football shop which I'm not against but
I wouldn't say is like in my wheelhouse
it was also a pretty big ad and it
didn't have a link to a specific product
which meant I got to choose so I got
these classic superstar shoes I thought
this is a style that a lot of people
have been wearing recently and I've had
my eye on these for a while I feel like
I'm going to look too sporty and ready
for action there we go it's always an
interesting experiment when I get like
commonly worn cute shoes since my feet
are quite long I feel like sometimes I
look like I wearing slippers but with
these I think it works out okay there's
like a little bit of arch support which
is exactly what my flat feet in general
I feel like I wouldn't usually follow
that adidas ad especially since it
didn't like link out anywhere but you
know for the purposes of this experiment
I was excited to get these shoes and I
really do like them I think they're
super cute so this next product is the
john frieda haircare I'm not sure how
curated the john frieda ad was to me but
it did seem curated to the outside lands
live story because of the people in the
ad who seemed to be musicians I don't
think there's a Dixie Chicks but I don't
know who they are so I picked up a John
Frieda shampoo and conditioners I guess
Joan freed is a company that does this
brilliant net stuff which is kind of fun
so I wash my hair with these earlier
today all right time to shower so it
says it infuses rich dark tones you can
deepen the spectrum of your natural
brunette color I'm not sure what
difference we're going to be able to see
in one wash but John Frieda the raita
thought about you all right let's crack
open our really in brunette visibly
deeper colors deepening shampoo it is
pretty nice is lathering up pretty well
the other guys
yeah feel pretty good though here's the
conditioner I'll just dry out all right
grab the end good night I mean it feel
like commissioner I just want to know of
my brunette hair color is just
incredibly enhanced after this
shampooing experience I don't think that
I'm able to see any type of results in
this one wash but I did like how it
smelled and how it feels
my scalp can be kind of finicky so I
don't think I'm going to just start
using only this I'm down to add it into
the rotation here and there we'll see if
any dandruff ensues so up next is my
body by Victoria sexy push-up bra I feel
like this ad was decently targeted
towards me like they know my demographic
so Victoria's Secret's probably like
anyone want a bra you get this ad I will
say that it feels really nice and soft
I've just been kind of petting it as
I've been talking I hope that it's as
comfortable when I put it off I tried to
pick like the most revealing shirt to
show the pushup I'm selecting my blue
mussels but of course I still don't have
any cleavage so it barely matters I'm
not sure if it's the most flattering bra
on me
I got a 32d but maybe I should go for a
34 a just have like a little bit of a
bigger band size but besides that I
really like the material of the bra I
don't know what it is I don't think it's
cotton
but it's nice and soft and I want to pet
it so the next thing is this black
cherry limeade Starbucks refresher I
don't know if this was super targeted
towards me I do have a Starbucks account
so maybe they like know that but also a
ton of people drink Starbucks alright
let's take a sip not bad I have had
refreshers before and I think the other
flavors are better this one has got a
weird aftertaste tal you want to try it
yeah I feel like a jerk or I do want to
try this thing I like the refreshers a
lot isn't there an opportunity to what
is that it tastes like they mixed
together to Capri Suns at the same time
they're not quite working I really
actually do like the other refreshers
flavors that I've tried I just don't
like this one I like this one yeah
they're keeping it though huh okay so
the last thing is the custom crusty
birthday geofilter it got approved and I
purchase it like an in-app purchase late
last night so let's see how
look in real life I'm gonna take a
selfie oh my fingers look really long so
let's take a look at the geofilters and
see our Krusty birthday geofilter Los
Angeles living my best life and I'll get
that oh there it is happy bday Krusty oh
wow and magnificent
happy birthday Krusty how old are you
today so requesting birthday we made him
a little kitty cake it's mostly like
tuna egg white cheddar cheese and a
little shrimp garnish on the top
Krusty likes cheese I hope rusty likes
this because I don't are you lurking
crush you are you lucky that we chose
today to be your birthday
we got a few hours of fun out of the
custom geofilter and I think Krusty
enjoyed his birthday Krusty is running
away from the hot dog guy
happy birthday Percy happy birthday to
you happy birthday to you happy birthday
dear Krusty happy birthday to you
you like the shrimp so I guess
henceforth August 13th shall be known as
Krusty's birthday happy sweet 16 aka
sweet 80th sweet ages Krusty I don't
think that this was super personalized
to me like I think that they probably
advertised geofilters to anyone who
maybe even just like roll through
geofilters a lot so I think that it was
a pretty general ad but it was still
pretty fun I'm not sure when I will do
it again but it did bring me enough
enjoyment that I will consider doing it
again okay so that was my snapchat haul
my overall impression of snapchat adds
that they are all pretty different from
each other and they kind of come in
different formats some are interactive
some you can like push up to see more or
be linked to a website some loop some
play right through and I kind of wish
there was a little more uniformity I
feel like the type of companies that
advertise on snapchat
are the most similar to the type of
companies that advertise on YouTube in
general it's companies or brands that
I've already
heard of and they're just sort of doing
like awareness campaign about their
brand in general or maybe a new product
that they're coming out with I don't
think that any of the ads were super
personalized to me and not even just
like my personality even to my
demographic but I will say that this has
been one of my favorite halls in terms
of the items that I got I think that my
favorite thing was probably the pair of
Adidas shoes but I did actually really
enjoy the krusty birthday geofilter you
know just love that cat want to just
shower him with love that he doesn't
understand and we'll never know about
you're welcome Krusty thank you guys so
