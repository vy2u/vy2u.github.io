video today I'm going to be buying the
first five things that YouTube
recommends to me so I've done this with
Facebook and Instagram ads before
testing to see how well their algorithm
knew me or knew what I might like and
this time I'm taking on YouTube so what
I mean by that is that I'm going to be
buying the stuff from the ads that play
before the videos from what I can tell
ads can differ from channel to channel
so today I'm going to be focusing on the
ads that I can trigger on my channel
just to keep it focused to what YouTube
thinks about me Facebook and Instagram
have their own little shields of how
they pick ads for you to go in your
newsfeed fubu also has something about
YouTube pre-roll ads it's mostly just
the type of videos that you've watched
what websites you visit and what apps
you use and then it kind of goes into
like demographics like geography and age
and that type of stuff another thing
that makes YouTube ads different is that
sometimes they'll blast them and for
some periods of time you see the same ad
a lot around YouTube hey I'm out here my
garage my hyundai elantra
got good gas mileage and for that reason
I can kind of guess a couple of the ads
what I might see today feel like I'm
going to end up with an easy to setup
web site at the interface okay cool
let's get into it
okay so I'm going to start with my I
wore the ugliest swimsuit in the world
for a day video I wonder if there are
ads on this video than I under I I
understand the crotch was a bit alarming
let's pick something like how about I
got a head-to-toe pastel makeover oh
here we go red bowl there's a lot of
different ones sugar free there's a
purple acai how do I wait do I have to
click on it while it's happening baby
all right let's see Red Bull assign
strength okay
so we're taking a note we're going to
get an acai purple edition dreadful that
is the first item that happened the acai
one piqued my interest it looks kind of
like a four lokos like a virgin for Luca
okay cool how about the Japanese dollar
store makeup challenge that sounds like
one that might have an ad
front of it oh no add more so okay let's
look at other possible videos how about
18 hour lipstick oh we've got a Rimmel
London stay matte liquid lip color this
was like pretty Taylor to the video okay
cool so it has a shop now link let's
click that which one should I get
oh wow there's a black one oh there's a
navy blue one I think the one that she
had on was maybe cloned this show is
that a pun the other ones are just like
mocha blush rose and shine and it's like
come on the show I feel like at this
point we might have to get plum this
show I'm adding it to my bag alright
let's try my boyfriend does my makeup
red gold
okay I can click on the link now oh yeah
it took me to the page that I found
independently red bull you're already
we're already buying your auto you drink
in this video what do you guys think is
on my I bought the first five things
Instagram recommended to me fiver
I feel like fiber is definitely one of
those me mad like I know that 5r
advertised on YouTube okay cool so we
get to ask fiver to do something by the
way
fiber is a website where you can get
people to do services for you starting
at five bucks we're going to be careful
with this one
okay cool so I wanted fiber one of the
options is music and audio maybe we can
get someone to make me a new intro song
now I like my intro song and I don't
necessarily think I'm going to change it
I've just heard it like 20 times today
let's take a look at what the jingles
and drop section says someone says I
will play your radio commercial 4464
time this by bus by bus yeah starting at
5 bucks ah here we go
I can pay this guy I will produce
podcast intro or jingle full band 25
bucks to get a one day delivery of a new
intro song that's what I want I think
let's see what he sounds like
cool alright so I'm going to order a
one-day delivery from this guy for 25
bucks
he says enter your lyrics this is to see
his new intro song that's what I want is
where's the wood so let's go back to the
main videos page and see what we've got
mmm how about mixing my own lip colors
Schick intuition oh I wonder did I talk
about being hairy in this video I mean
maybe they think I haven't shaved my
legs in a while maybe they know oh no I
let it play through again damn it okay
it was the Schick intuition yeah here it
is Shemp simplify simplify your shave
with shave cream right on the razor I
can get an island berry razor a pure
nourishment razor or a sensitive care
razor I'm going to be honest I kind of
think of myself as the queen of ingrown
don't at me so I'm going to go for
sensitive care got three point seven
stars 103 reviews let's see what people
have to say people are liking it liking
it great shape excellent see there's
some there's someone stars
let's see you Oh can't get a close shave
my poor wallet doesn't last long
so let's get it and see if we're on the
five-star side or the one-star side so I
think I've just got one more left to go
let's click on creating a custom
lipstick at the bite lip lab this is the
red bowl again I feel like in just like
you guys are up late watching videos you
must be tired have a Red Bull how about
we go for the krusty video literally
look at what Krusty's doing right now if
you're gonna pour to though stress loss
f is for Fendi crusty gets some like
design or asked shifted man who hello
see I would get like a keychain
but that's 240 bucks usually anything
for crusty but this time crust each is
breaking the bank
alright we've been striking out in the
last year we need a good one how about
wearing clear plastic jeans for a week
and see what if the clear pants have
anything for me kind like a crystal ball
wicks it's wicks this to me is like one
of the ads that I always see so wicks
came through in the clutch at one
for in the morning they were like we
don't care what time it is we want you
to build a custom website so I'm going
to sign up for Wix and when I get my
other stuff I'm going to build my
website at the same time so at this
point I think that we have our whole
we've got the Red Bull acai drink the
Rimmel London liquid lipstick the fiber
new intro song the Schick razor and the
Wix website next time you see me I'll
have my YouTube Hall and then also have
to set up a website ok so it's a couple
of days later and I have my whole I
think I'm going to start with the
lipstick so let's move this stuff over
to the side really quick and let me
quickly transform the space into a
beauty video tada
so these are the Rimmel stay matte
liquid lipsticks I've got three of them
this one is called be my baby this one
is blue iris and this one is plum this
show and I'm going to start with be my
baby all right so I'm going to mix this
guy up kind of feels kind of a mu C
chocolate mousse not like the animals
the mousse so this advertisement was
before my I tried 18 hour lipstick video
and it feels like kind of like a sweet
spot for this ad though this color is a
little bit on the pink side for me one
of the things I do like about it is that
it is the same color as the inside of my
mouth you can't see the butthole or at
least you can't really see it okay
lipstick number two from this show
there's something like very waxy smelly
about these as a kid I used to gnaw on
candle explains a lot I didn't eat paint
chips you did eat paint you okay just
candle plain candles and crayons I would
say for this one maybe a little bit more
layering is needed
it does seem to layer nicely like it
doesn't dry down too fast but with the
new D one it was a little more like one
and done this is a little more like
hello darkness my old friend okay so
this is the last one it is the blue iris
color alright let's try and put this guy
on this one we're definitely not two
layer it's a little tricky to start but
if I can build it up I'll be a happy gal
I think overall this is a pretty good
lipstick for the price point but it is a
little bit on the streaky side
especially with the darker colors I
personally really like this blue color
but if I were going to recommend these
lipsticks I would recommend the nudie
ones or the lighter ones
this one didn't really have any issue
with like being opaque at all or not
being opaque so that is the first thing
from our hull next up is the Schick
razor okay so let's go try this out
opening up my treasure so basically the
premise is that it's a normal razor
surrounded by built-in shaving cream and
it actually is kind of Noble like a
little bit kind of like mobile removals
around alright so I'm going to rinse the
leg and then I'm going to come in or
this guy I feel like it makes sense that
Google knows that I'm a 24 year old
woman who lives in California and it's
the summer so I might need to shave my
legs
I need a seem to be moisturizing and
then shaving and moisturizing it looks
right now like the razors on the perfect
level with the rest of shaving cream
what happens when you wear down the
shaving cream yours less like a razor
and the machine comes down here alright
I'm going to do the other leg now and
then we'll take a look at how it looks
down there my legs look a little bit
strawberry ish the ingrown hairs aren't
more or less irritated I don't I
couldn't see exactly what was happening
because there was just like more surface
area around it that wasn't the razor and
so that reason I still think I've missed
a couple more sauce like this one down
here but like I do think that there is
something fun about this for like after
the fact shaving as long as it's like
immediately after the fact so everything
is still a little moist it does feel
like a fun like on-the-go thing like if
you like how like an overnight bag or
going on vacation really quick you know
like TSA ain't gonna stop you probably
fun you have to believe that okay so
that was the Schick razor side note
though these things just flow on my hand
after the shower okay cool so before we
move on to what fiber has in store for
me we have these red bulbs I'm not a
huge Red Bull fan I'm more of a coffee
person but I'm open to it again
oh all right I'm just going to go for it
okay don't I need to tell you another
case I don't know that that was very
strange I'm going to try again okay the
second fit tastes a bit better if you
feel like one of those Starbucks
refresher like super super sweet I don't
think I like it but I kind of want to
keep drinking it alright I'm going to
open this the line one maybe the line
one will be a little more tart
oh this one smells better this one
tastes kind of like a sweet
sprite and a Jolly Rancher together I'm
going to be honest between the two I
vastly prefer the line man your
phenomena yeah between the two of us
Tyler's got the sweet tooth so maybe
you'll like that one should gargle with
it
yeah interesting attitude yeah it tastes
like aspartame okay I said each one this
is a live edition it was like Mountain
Dew or like surge oh it kind of seems
like Mountain Dew yeah see I thought it
was a jolly rancher in spite of its
right yeah I can already feel it in my
head when I ordered these I said they're
kind of like virgin four lokos and I
think I was right so now we only have
our intangibles I have actually my five
our new intro song delivered so let's
start with that now I like my intro song
and I don't actually think I'm going to
be changing it but I was just listening
to it a lot that day so thought might as
well just see what else is out there I
haven't listened to it yet so whatever
happens is going to be a surprise for
you and me all right ready
well that made me feel like I just drank
another Red Bull Thank You Andrews
guitar that was awesome
that made me happy I'm going to accept
and review order I'm giving it all five
stars
they say sounds great Andros that is
going to be heavily featured on my Wix
website so that was awesome I actually
got that in one day from when I ordered
it so that was cool too
the next thing is the Wix website so Wix
like Fiverr is one of those ads that
I've seen everywhere so I was very
excited when I saw Wix sells like
finally I'm going to get to the bottom
of this so the first question is what
kind of website do you want to create I
kind of want to make a website where we
can showcase our beautiful new intro
song of two options I can either create
my website with Wix Adi or with Wix
editor
maybe Adi will be like more helpful
there's actually it's been no
transaction of money yet so far on Wix
oh I don't know how expensive it is
hello I am Adi now that I've learned who
you are I'll use that information to
design a website that's uniquely yours
reminds me of the paperclip member the
paperclip little Microsoft Word guy now
I'm going to create your home page
alright do it man do it
this is endre I kind of just like
watching him just work okay so you have
to put an image in I'm gonna bring this
imogen that's my winning image of the
day okay so they're suggesting I add a
meet the team I want to I want song so I
want like mp3 possibilities feel like
this is ballooning very quickly I'm just
like dragging things from the sidebar in
like let's just try and connect a domain
buy a domain name and get this thing on
the web and then hopefully after I do
that - let me upload my own stuff right
I want Sophia's new intro song calm it's
available well first try o manage my
music yeah okay maybe we can do that
create playlist yes add tracks here we
go I'm doing it will this work
that was awesome I think that's all that
I want to be a migrant it seems kind of
like Wix isn't like that easy to use
it's not just like a no-brainer but you
know if you like actually we're trying
to make a website it seems like it could
be a helpful tool you just have to be a
little more patient than I want to be
right now okay so that was my YouTube
haul out of all the things I think that
Fiverr was my favorite I don't think
that the fiber ad was personalized to me
or my interest but it was super fun to
try out something I see on YouTube all
the time and I really like my home but
overall I feel like Google and YouTube
just try a lot of different strategies
when putting ads in front of YouTube
videos they have some that are more
awareness marketing some that are more
like buy this now or click this now some
that are more targeted to you and what
you're watching and some that are just
more general all around YouTube because
of that the ads that you get from even
just one channel on YouTube can be all
over the place I mean I feel like you
can tell that just by looking at this
haul a guy got lipstick a razor red bull
a song and a website a little bit me a
little bit all over the place a little
bit of Carl o'clock thank you guys so
