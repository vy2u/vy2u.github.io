video this week I'm gonna be dressing
like Bratz dolls from the early 2000s
now if you were between the ages of 5
and 12 in 2001 you'll probably remember
when Bratz dolls exploded into toy
aisles for the very first time with
their giant heads multi-ethnic squad
lack of feet and emphasis on trendy
funky current looking fashion Barbie who
had been the queen bee of the doll
market for 42 years was undeniably shook
I was nine when Bratz first came out so
I was maybe a little too old for Barbie
but I was definitely interested in
limited too so I found myself loving the
Bratz as clothes and my mom hated the
fact that they were called Bratz since
that's basically what every parent wants
their child not to be don't fear eyes
accessorize unlike a Barbie who has more
of a timeless professional look
Bratz were much more contemporary so I
figured by trying this experiment I
would both be fulfilling a childhood
dream of dressing like a Bratz doll and
also opening a time capsule into
over-the-top early 2000s fashion so I
bought four dolls from the early years
of Bratz and made sure that I had one of
each of the four original girls Yasmin
Cloe Sasha and Jade that leaves some of
the other dolls including my favorite
Megan out of the picture but I think
even just doing these four should give
us a good dose of early 2000s nostalgia
alright let's dive right in so for this
first outfit I picked Yasmin as our
fashion muse so this is my 2001 original
Yasmin outfit this is og this is Gen one
Yasmin
yasmin is one of brats --is
most-produced dolls appearing in almost
every collection that they've made and
she's also named after the president of
mga entertainments daughter Jasmine so
it's safe to say she's a house favorite
Jasmine's nickname is pretty princess
and she's interested in fashion as they
all are but she's also shy quiet
reserved and a good writer where are you
getting this from the brass wikipage
okay gotcha all facts Jasmine's main
outfit here comes with a purple velour
ish velvet tube top a pair of white
jeans with orange embellishments at the
bottom purple platform shoes a woven
backpack and a brown bandana headband
this outfit was pretty difficult to find
in human sizes it was weirdly impossible
to find low-rise white flared jeans my
pants are a little high for 2001 but for
my 2018 booty and abdomens they're just
right we also tried to DIY a more
accurate looking headband bandana but
they kept turning out looking like none
in training habits and that's definitely
not the vibe oh my god there's a Von
Dutch store
I need a trucker hat I think I'll
compete with your bandana too much nuts
on top of it kind of like Eminem style
or was that fitting pretty much
everything about this outfit reminds me
of clothes from the early 2000s that I
really wanted to wear but wasn't allowed
to on the back of Yasmin's box it says
that she's interested in bohemian styles
but I would say her outfit reminds me
more of styles worn by pop and hip-hop
stars over the time I think that if
Instagram existed into
the brats would definitely be
influencers it'd be fashion Nova babes
when your brats boyfriend has a second
plastic phone I feel like the closest
comp to Yasmin's outfit is probably
Jennifer Lopez from the Jenny from the
block music video but shades of this
crop top and low-rise flare jeans style
can be seen on Aaliyah Destiny's Child
Christina Aguilera 3lw
and just generally like MTV from 2001
yeah you could be on next
honestly just on my tab so I'm gonna
have to say next Yasmin's makeup is an
interesting mix of contemporary and
throwback
I don't remember such complex i looks
existing back in the day but the lip
look with a dark lip liner and a lighter
iridescent center is very much that
natis style this is very similar to the
lip licks color that was like my very
first lip gloss in third grade
overall this outfit was really fun but
mildly uncomfortable certain aspects
like the iridescent lip gloss and the
bandanna really reminded me of my own
tween years but the tube top and pants
required a lot of adjusting on the go
and the platform shoes were kind of like
mini stilts don't step on that dog with
those boots on that was
that wiener dog was nearly a goner
I also stuck out a lot in this outfit
partially because of how tall I was but
also because of how long my white pants
work which actually mirrors Yasmin's
proportions as her legs are incredibly
long when compared to her much shorter
torso
they say she's life-size she's how about
over six feet beyond
so for our second doll I picked Chloe
the blond of the Bratz pack
say hello to 2002 express it Chloe
I think the expressive collection is
basically just like a funky fashion
collection with most of the girls just
wearing contemporary clothing in like
warm toned colors don't forget to
express yourself do I spell that with an
e or an X only an X if you fill it with
an e you are expelled
put an X at the end of brats
Chloe's outfit here includes a sparkly
skinny scarf and orange tank top a denim
maxi skirt with a lace inset a bedazzled
red belt cowboy boots and a red and
brown handbag with the word angel on the
front hi my name is Chloe and my nick
name is angel and I like drawing art and
soccer this is a nightmare
you're like Evel woody more like I'm
like limited to jet she's also wearing a
few simple twisty braids in her hair
these braids are almost like the ones
that would be made by one of those
twisty Conair things that you would use
it a sleepover this outfit was
reasonably easy to find except for the
lace inset on the skirt so we sewed this
in besides that the bag the top and the
scarf we got secondhand this outfit to
me reads more like that boho style that
Yasmin's box mentioned earlier around
this time many celebrities donned
peasant tops flowy maxi skirts and
layered tunics in earth tones and in
fact the term boho chic was apparently
coined in 2002 on me I think it looks a
little bit more like a Phoebe Buffay
like you know I could have an acoustic
guitar in my arms and be serenading a
smelly cat denon was also wildly popular
in the early nineties with denim skirts
being a favorite option in pretty much
any length the denim skirts a little bit
big but I feel like they just don't make
denim maxi skirts like they used to it's
more like a curtain yeah it's a bit more
of a folksy look than I remember Bratz
having but I guess as fashionistas they
basically explored every style out there
hey Soph you'll play soccer sure that is
one of my passions besides fashion
now I'm a naturally athletic oh my god
that was this world I don't want to play
anymore
Chloe's makeup kind of contrasts with
her boho s clothes as her lips are
frosted and lined with a hot pink color
oh sorry brats don't have mustaches
ignore that bringing that Bratz glam to
an otherwise more toned down outfit I do
think that lip gloss technology has
advanced slightly in the 16 years since
this doll came out but it still goes
away pretty quickly I don't think the
Bratz are drinking coffee though it's
unclear how old they're supposed to be
they're like kind of in high school but
they're also like rock stars I was never
really a maxi skirt kind of tween so I
didn't ever have anything like this
outfit but I did enjoy wearing it I've
gotten a lot of compliments on the
cowboy boots actually like people have
like actually been like I like your
boots
maybe that's them kind of being like not
the rest of the outfit though you're
trying hard it was also of all of the
outfits one of the more comfortable ones
especially because my cowboy boots
were not platforms she doesn't have feet
either which is my friend how do you
know what feet are I mean she doesn't
have shoes so for a third outfit I chose
Sasha to be our guide so here is 2003
winter wonderland Sasha
we did term one the LED so for this
wintertime wonderland outfit we really
wanted to find snow even if we weren't
able to actually snowboard or sled as it
seems like sasha is doing so we drove
about an hour away to get to Mount Baldy
attention we have snow on the side of
the road snow which was a questionable
health and well-being decision given the
fact that Sasha's outfit seems like it's
mostly suitable for like 50 degree
weather I feel a little bit less like
Shaun White and a little bit more like
if Paris Hilton had like done the simple
life I like a ski lodge but hey at least
we got to take Sasha to the snow
apparently it's 11 degrees up there see
these gloves and parka might not be
Bratz approved but Bratz can't get
hypothermia Sasha's ski outfit includes
a blue faux fur hat and blue sunglasses
a green turtleneck with a sparkly
snowflake applique a white vest a blue
sequined belt a green messenger bag
medium washed jeans blue faux fur leg
warmers and Dwight platform boots this
chair lift is very frozen we were very
much wearing jeans winter Tom what
Roddy
Tasha Sasha's makeup is also very
glittery and festive with the trademark
Bratz cut crease and lip liner being
traded out for just more glitter thank
God we're off at Wow oh it's not that
bad up here that ski lift was Devils
this outfit was pretty difficult to
piece together some things like the
jeans and the vest were pretty easy to
find but a lot of the embellishments had
to be di wide and I couldn't find a
green messenger bag like hers anywhere
besides that I feel like I was able to
stay true to the spirit of her outfit
especially with the matching blue faux
fur hat and leg warmers see this could
weirdly be a good thing to wear Ross
skiing or snowboarding because if you
get lost in the mountain people might be
able to see you from the air the
colorful shearling and fur faux and real
became very popular in the early 2000s
with some of the main proponents of this
trend being rapper Cam'ron Paris Hilton
and pretty much anyone who wore pastel
uggs chocolate even though Sasha has a
snow disk snowboarding and extreme snow
sports in general became very popular in
the late 90s and early 2000s being seen
as more rebellious younger and cooler
than old-school downhill skiing when
you're pretending to snowboard but
you've only ever seen Johnny tsunami it
also had a bigger media platform than
ever before with the winter x-games
being broadcast live for the very first
time in 2002 yelling at her children I
thought she was like stop bath overall I
think I was pretty unprepared for the
snow and cold in this outfit the jeans
were probably the worst part my butt
still what can you tell actually yes I
can it is very clear the Hat was
probably the best part because at least
my ears didn't get cold but on the way
down the mountain my hat flew off and
just barely got rescued by the ski lift
attendants who strapped to the chair
behind us
thank you I'm pretty sure the people
working on the mountain thought I was
insane so for our final outfit I let
Jade take us out on the town so this is
my 2003 Spring Fling Jade outfit this
doll doesn't have a commercial because
she was a Jade exclusive collector's
edition but I think her bold outfit
stands on its own two silver shoe
plugins are those the Bratz boys come to
pick me up for the Spring Fling well
you're too late
I've already arrived and I am going stag
Jade's outfit here includes a yellow
glittery newsboy cap a purple faux fur
jacket a yellow tank top with the word
chick on it a bedazzled yellow belt
dark-wash flare jeans silver platform
shoes and a blue spherical beaded
handbag are you trying to Club me with
your ornament watch out I think it's
kind of heavy is it really oh my god
that they would knock me out there's
some ass to this that's a mace this
outfit was medium hard to find we were
able to buy everything but a lot of the
extra sparkles and bedazzles had to be
di wide on the Hat and on the boobs it's
kind of like those bedazzled baby shirts
oh yeah except instead of Bibbit its
chick it's like you know and icarly it's
not an Apple computer it's a pair of
computer Jade's outfit here is kind of
like a going out clubbing or school
dancing look and it combines many an
early 2000s trend as seen on celebrities
like Paris Hilton Lindsay Lohan Hilary
Duff and Cameron Diaz amongst others
dammit I should have brought a flip
phone damn it
I
like huh for Jade's makeup she has a
dramatic purple and blue cut crease
eyeshadow look and pearlescent pink lip
gloss I don't think my attempt to do a
cut crease today really succeeded but
Jade never closes her eyes so you can't
really tell when my eyes are open
I never owned anything quite like this
but I did have a cap or two and I think
everyone had a bedazzled t-shirt I'm
pretty sure that was just a rite of
passage don't you know I have a passion
for fashion and yes this once was
fashion this look kind of became a
stereotype depicting what people thought
was a stylish but superficial girl like
it reminds me a lot of Elle Woods from
Legally Blonde or like lizzie McGuire's
nemesis Kate or like Regina George like
one of the plastics from Mean Girls and
all of those characters are like at
first perceived to be bitsy in some way
but they have redemptive arcs where you
then like learn that they are smarter or
nicer than you first thought they were
so looking back this outfit almost dares
you to judge it's sparkly newsboy cap by
its cover
I don't know if I could do that again
I'm gonna fall over I'm gonna be honest
I think this ended up being my favorite
outfit mostly because of the giant
purple fuzzy jacket it surprisingly had
some swagger to it yeah I'm pretty sure
this jacket is being worn to intimidate
the other toys this used to be a teddy
bear
don't be JT you're crazy the only thing
I don't think I could wear again is the
shoes my toes are gonna need some time
to recuperate after this my feet are
bleeding so in the 2000s rats were able
to storm onto the scene and snatch 40%
of the fashion doll market share in just
five years mostly because kids including
myself wanted to dress like them
so having gotten to finally dress like
them I can tell you that there are some
pros and some cons the worst part was
definitely the shoes Bratz don't have
feet so they can never truly understand
the pain of a giant platform it was also
a little less satisfying dressing like a
Bratz given that these looks are pretty
out of style so I was flying solo
without my brat pack but the clothes
themselves were just as enjoyably
irreverent fun fluffy and over-the-top
as I had hoped in some ways I'm still
just a little unibrow nine-year-old
inside aren't we all are we
even if the clothes are pretty out of
style I think that Bratz makeup is
actually more contemporary looking now
than it was back then I'm just gonna put
up a side-by-side of Kylie Jenner's
makeup and a Bratz doll face and you
guys can draw your own conclusions even
though the popularity of Bratz dolls has
faded over time I think that the Bratz
will always have a place in our hearts
as the dolls that knocked Barbie off her
pedestal and irritated the heck out of
our parents thank you guys so much for
