video today I'm gonna be dressing like
we did 50 years ago in 1967 1967 was the
year that brought us the summer of love
Disney's The Jungle Book the first
successful human heart transplant and
the births of Vin Diesel Julia Roberts
and Rolling Stone magazine from the
Mamas to the Papas 1967 was a year of
looking for Lucy in the Sky with
Diamonds and getting seduced by mrs.
Robinson
while Jimi Hendrix was setting his
guitar on fire thousands of people
marched on Washington to try and
literally lift the Pentagon building
with their minds yes that actually
happened in regards to what we were
wearing it was a year of short skirts
Nehru jackets clear plastic clothing and
flowers in your hair as for hairstyles
sixties hair was all over the map some
of it was long and unkempt some of it
was super short and some of it was
quaffed into gravity defying modern art
pieces so once again I recruited my
friend Kaylee Melissa a hair stylist and
youtuber to aid me in my quest to become
a far-out 60s chick so with some
assistance and after consulting a few
magazines sewing patterns a little bit
of Mad Men and my dad I think I've
managed to put together three outfits
that represent some of the iconic styles
of the time as always I'm going to be
focusing mostly on American style though
for this video I feel like it's
impossible to ignore the British
influences on 60s fashion so 1967 what
happened and what we wore so for my
first outfit I went for this mod mini
dress ensemble fix new buttons
it's pretty far out that's how high they
are this look was inspired by 1960s
icons like Twiggy Jean Shrimpton Goldie
Hawn and these girls in the background
of the Austin Powers intro sequence
groovy baby oh my god a key piece of the
swinging 60s was the miniskirt a
controversial fashion statement that
spread like wildfire ruffling the
feathers of famed designers like Coco
Chanel who said it was just awful as
well as fans of traditional fashion
everywhere fine what's that I've never
heard of that before yes that's what's
above your knees what Sharon no skirts
and dresses in the 50s were usually full
and hit at the knee and miniskirts were
only really seen in sci-fi movies giving
the mini when it was popularized in the
60s a futuristic appeal it's kind of
weird to think about thighs being
innovative because I feel like I've been
wearing minis my whole life but you know
here we go bye so for this outfit I
chose a green mini dress with buttons
down the front ivory colored stockings
black Mary Jane shoes a black plastic
handbag and this giant green bangle this
is the greenness you've ever been I love
how I like kind of came to this park to
be like oh I'll match but I'm like way
more neon than the grass this mod style
of bright colors short cuts and
geometric shapes had become pretty
widespread the year earlier in 1966 you
keep on trying to have like a shocked
look on your face I don't know I feel
like that's the pose yeah like you're
supposed to be like oh when style icon
and model Twiggy erupted onto the
fashion scene
oh I'm Twiggy
with a lot of a bigger butt I'm sick e
GH I see see why
but before mod was a style it was also a
subculture the mod short for modernist
scene originated in British jazz clubs
in the late 50s post-war England was
seeing good economic times and young
people had extra pocket change which
they spent on high-end clothes new
records and decked out Vespa scooters
mods congregated in 24-hour coffee bars
to listen and danced jazz music coffee
bar let's go in powered by caffeine
amongst other things
where's the jukebox well it's not in the
pretzel section it Kayle a new
instrument from India however whether it
was the Twiggy board games or lunchboxes
by 1967 as many people flocked to the
mod style most of the original mods
tired of the mainstream attention and
moved on so mob turned from a noun to an
adjective from the mods to mod style
once you've made the JCPenney and
Spiegel catalog you're pretty mainstream
for my hair we went with this bangs and
slight pouf style feelin mod was all
about like the shapes and their lines
so we're basically creating shapes and
lines with your hair hair architecture
that's what this is 1967 was a
transition year in many ways and fur
hair I think we were caught between the
hairspray to death flip of the earlier
60s and the free flowing locks of the
seventies I hope I didn't mess up my
banks too much I promised Kayleigh I
wouldn't touch him but I feel like I've
been touching them and for my makeup I
went with pale eyeshadow a black cat eye
winged a Twiggy inspired cut crease line
twice as much flight power and nude
lipstick I think white lipstick was also
in but a pale pale nude was a popular
choice mod style was revived in the
1980s and in the 2000s and though I feel
like muted nude and dark colors are more
in style than bright neons nowadays mod
fashion is so iconic that it tends to
pop up regularly do I look swingin
as long as you don't hit the camera
swimming 60s swinging that's a weapon
so for my next look I rode the fashioned
pendulum all the way down to the ground
with this body skimming maxi dress I
called this outfit
the lengthy lady maxi mama mm for this
outfit I paired this long purple
patterned dress with silver bangles
shoes a silver handbag and these large
blueish pearly earrings you look like
you've been in casing like a rhinestone
for 40 years and I just popped out 50
years while the early and mid 60s
brought with them the miniskirt the end
of the decade brought a completely
opposite silhouette into the picture
long unseen CH dresses in a loose almost
nightgown desk style were all over the
fashion magazines that I found from 1967
gone were the girdles of the 50s in fact
the less you could see of the waist and
the better I'm trying to stand up as
straight as possible because there's no
shape to the dress
so I'm like I must have shoulders like a
hanger this fashion 180 but the trend of
hemlines getting progressively shorter
with time as dresses hadn't been this
long since World War 1 I think it liked
the max enos of the dress is also
applying dear dramatic miss excuse you
in general these looks were inspired by
international designs like the caftan
from the Middle East and North Africa
and the Nehru collar and paisley pattern
from India I feel like it's hard to
really like pinpoint who exactly this
girl is she's kind of just like a
fashion forward on
woman you're going a penguin you could
be at home you could be at a house party
you could be out working you could be
jet-setting vacationing lunching a lot
of different opportunities to wear this
dress
augmented by some highly publicized
celebrity trips to South Asia in the
late 60s international air travel as a
whole was perceived as glam and
luxurious and if you were going
somewhere exotic that also meant
dressing the part
in this an appropriate moment for the
transatlantic accent it might be hello
Fred oh my god come to another video I
just immediately regretted that and even
if you weren't going anywhere maybe you
also wanted to join in on the fun
oh my god so designers like Emilio Pucci
created looks that channeled that
jet-setting fantasy that's total cz this
yeah don't worry this is plastic this
dress in particular was my grandmother's
from India her brother who lived in the
u.s. sent her the fabric and she had it
sewn into this dress so not necessarily
internationally inspired but literally
international also secret pocket hmm
for my hair we went with a structured
updo with this braid detail and we've
opened a lot of time looking through
images last night and we agreed that the
ariana grande silhouette was very
popular it seems like abstract somewhat
impractical styles with strategic
baubles and lots of volume were favored
to compliment these loose maxi dresses
though in the 60s these would have been
achieved with hair clip-ons known as wig
--let's for this look Kaley just used
some hair extensions to give my head
helmet some body you've got like a
second head back here I'm a little bit
like Professor Quirrell yeah it's also
like your second head has like a will
buyers haircut for my makeup I chose a
pale blue eye shadow and black cat
eyeliner and once again a very muted lip
color I think in general for 60s makeup
you needed like some serious eyeliner
and some very very light lipstick gloss
something it's almost like the 2007
concealer lip this dress made me feel
and act a little bit over-the-top I
think I was trying to channel good old
Liz Taylor oh I've married full 45 men
and kept all the jewels it was accurate
who coincidentally gathered quite to the
caftan collection during her life
maxi's mostly replaced the miniskirt
silhouette in the 70s and also had a
stint of popularity in the 90s a la
Phoebe Buffay I personally love maxi
skirts because I don't have to shave my
legs to wear them but I'm not sure how
long I would truly last inside of that
hair helmet it was pretty hard so for my
third outfit I went for a hippie
inspired summer of love and look look at
my Bush the copic it is the hippie
movement was born in Northern California
in the mid-1960s made up of people who
sought alternative ways to perceive the
world and build society I am a blade of
grass swaying in the wind that's like a
nineteen sixties version of firework at
times or most of the time encouraged by
mind-altering and psychedelic substances
do you ever feel like a blade of grass
getting plucked into someone else's
joint diametrically opposed to the
establishment and the escalation of the
Vietnam War the movement laced music
politics drug use and philosophy into a
distinct culture ready to explode by
1967 see I'm trying to do some moves
that I think would be appropriate I
think I just make a little bit like a
mom at Coachella I kind of call it like
massaging coaches though LSD was banned
in the u.s. in October of 1966 hippies
paid that pretty much no mind and
continued to congregate and take
psychedelics pretty brazenly I'm just
hugging the tree nothing to see here
just an active job on the backs of
popular musicians such as Jefferson
Airplane the Grateful Dead and Jimi
Hendrix the growth of psychedelic
culture spread nationwide and reached
the mainstream with the Summer of Love
in San Francisco where hundreds of
thousands gathered to demonstrate their
alignment with the hippie philosophy are
you dog circling right now I'm nesting
I mean I hate to break through that
patch right there might be from like dog
piss but you know let me just nest
slightly to the left there this outfit
includes a Paisley patterned orange mini
dress a plain knitted bag Brown
gladiator sandals lots of beaded
necklaces these circle ends Dwyer rimmed
sunglasses and an orange headband I also
went with pretty natural makeup and very
very long hair I always feel like I
shouldn't even be wearing clothes like I
should just be wearing hair just cover
my boobs with the hair and then just
keep going is that the plot of the
musical hair it might be this look
overall was inspired by a few
celebrities associated with the
counterculture movement like Michelle
Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas
Janis Joplin cher and Pattie Boyd Beatle
George Harrison's wife and to really
finish off the look we did need a little
George Harrison his love his love of a
Beatle
what's that accent Liverpool tyler's
look is inspired directly from George's
outfit here which includes a white shirt
denim jacket pendant necklace Paisley
pants brown shoes heart-shaped
wire-rimmed sunglasses and a nice thick
moustache
have you seen Paul and Ringo I think
they're hiding in your mustache tie
well I'm Heidi from Yoko as pretty much
the biggest band in the world
The Beatles brought a lot of attention
to psychedelic culture I am the Eggman
I am The Walrus Pikachu talking openly
about their experimentation and how it
influenced their music particularly
their 67 album sergeant pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band she's very easy to
entertain she's like he's killing people
I admire like he's not very good though
neither of us are wearing flowers
another name for hippy was flower child
as the flower held a strong significance
for the movement you bought out those
flowers yes all of their names are Susan
oftentimes worn in the hair like the now
snapchat famous flower crown the flowers
fit very nicely on my headband which I
like the items meaning expanded in
October of 67 when after attempts to
levitate the Pentagon failed hippies
filled the barrels of soldiers rifles
with flowers and flower power as a form
of peaceful protest was born of course
the real hippies didn't have this but
hey oh I got the flower crowd now that
looks good okay this looked to me feels
kind of like a meme outfit of what a
hippie would wear I think that things
like paisley patterns and long hair and
headbands were so widespread that
nowadays this almost looks like a hippie
costume but hey you know the meme had to
come from somewhere
in general though the mantra for hippies
was that you should dress like your own
fantasy so a lot of people wore whatever
they wanted from jeans and t-shirts to
absolutely nothing you know it's just
it's more of a
freeform don't let the man tell you what
to wear man look this is where they
stock the wood it's wood stock oh my god
we drove all the way here for that one
line all right let's go so those were my
1967 outfits overall it was really fun
trying to style looks around the 1967
aesthetic
I think the 60s are a very iconic decade
and a lot of the styles have been
revived many times over and almost never
seem to go fully out of fashion if I
were gonna bring anything back from 67
it would be the Maude hair the caftans
and Tyler's mustache so thank you guys
so much for sticking around for an
entire half-century of outfits this year
from the 2000s to the 60s it seems like
a lot of things have come in and out of
style and the fashion pendulum has swung
from one end to the other and back again
