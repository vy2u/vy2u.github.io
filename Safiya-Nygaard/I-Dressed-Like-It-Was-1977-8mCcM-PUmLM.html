video today I'm gonna be dressing like
we did 40 years ago in 1977 1977 was the
year that brought us Annie Hall the
first personal Apple Computer Space
Mountain in the births of Kanye West
Shakira and Chuckie Cheese from Burt
Reynolds mustache to Chewbacca's facial
hair 1977 was a year of lining up to
boogie at Studio 54 as well as to see
Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star
for the first time ever
while Abba was crooning about dancing
Queens and some dude named Fernando an
entire movie was being produced about
Arnold Schwarzenegger biceps in regards
to what we were wearing it was a year of
flared pants matching his and hers
blouses polyester everything and all of
this floofy hair from the Farrah flip to
the fluffy bowl-cut
seventies hair definitely had its
moments so once again Kaylee Melissa a
super talented hairstylist and youtuber
agreed to aid me in my quest to become a
foxy 70s mama so with some assistance
and after consulting a few fashion
magazines these 500-page JCPenney
catalogs and my mom I think I've managed
to put together three outfits that echo
some of the iconic looks of the time as
always I'm going to be focusing mostly
on an American fashion though as we know
Abba was from Sweden so 1977 what
happened and what we wore so for my
first outfit I whipped out the polyester
and a touch of suede for a business
casual pantsuit look my hair is Susan
and the sweetest wishin and
just going together this outfit was
inspired by several looks from the
JCPenney catalog as well as some leading
ladies from TV and film including Mary
Tyler Moore Annie Hall the Charlie's
Angels and the og Wonder Woman herself
Lynda Carter well her alter ego Diana
Prince is not working not literally
Wonder Woman super suit but that thing
is pretty fly
I'm not Wonder Woman I Drive this outfit
includes leather loafers Brown flared
pants this brown belt a striped
button-down shirt a tan suede jacket
this orange Ascot and these giant
glasses these like earthy and orangie
tones kind of make me feel like Velma
from scooby-doo oh yeah yes everything
is some type of brown or earth tone the
seventies color palette was very much a
reaction against the bright psychedelic
colors and rainbows of the 60s I've kind
of got like Velma glasses and orange
shaggy pants and fred ascot there's a
little bit of the whole gang this is
this yet this the shaggy run he goes
how do you do the Velma run probably the
same way yeah animated exactly the same
kind of like are leaning over and like
waiting for word this outfit could work
for an undercover agent or as office
wear but variations on this pants and
blouse outfit seemed to be everywhere as
pants became more mainstream as women's
wear you kind of look like you're
someone from Argo mm like an ambassador
hanging out with Ben Affleck not that
part as little as 10 years earlier women
wearing pants in everyday business or
formal settings was not exactly socially
acceptable but in the late 60s and early
70s many women began wearing more unisex
less typically feminine clothing and by
the late 70s pants were everywhere in
denim polyester and attached to halter
tops in Disco jumpsuits
these are bell-bottoms they're more like
bootcut Flair's but like I am going to
the office I'm not going to the disco
quite yet this entire look was also worn
by guys to flared pants loafers and wide
lapels shirts were popular amongst
everyone and so was this wavy hairstyle
with side swept bangs today I'm gonna
make you look like my mom in high school
she had these long Libby bangs and
basically everything is curled out away
from the face so I'm gonna get your hair
to have as much wealth eNOS as I can and
then we're using another toupee couldn't
go another video that low to panic
neither do paise they're important for
my makeup I went with gold and bronze
eye shadow mascara a bit of blush and a
neutral lip color I'm not too sure about
the eyebrows I think I might have too
much eyebrow for the 70s but um the
glasses mostly conceal those so that's
good
this outfit really does make me feel
like I'm some type of investigative
reporter this is why
you blend right in with the fall foliage
oh you're trying to blend in
that was your detective who are you
investigating right now you Hey yes
that's what I said you damn it I think
maybe it's the glasses or the old camera
that I found can I help you the under
arrest you're under but regardless it
was fun and I would definitely wear this
Ascot again now that I've double nodded
it it's never coming off snip it off
leave my I've got a loan for my second
outfit I threw on a leather jacket and
stuck some safety pins in my ears for
this Punk street fashion look I think
I'm like trying to figure out like how
angry I should be get to be mad there's
any form of government at all in 1977
the punk movement was growing
concurrently in New York and in London
led by major music acts such as The
Ramones blondie The Sex Pistols and the
clash
if you're an American punk you do this
but if you're a British Punk you do this
Brewed I don't know you can do it with
both hands actually don't know which
hand this is in here like bow hand
like this one was lost like you shot an
arrow never though punks on different
sides of the pond had slightly different
styles the underlying ideology was
mostly the same mainstream music sucked
mainstream politics sucked
hippies sucked and maybe we should give
an archaic amps and in this case you're
basically angry at the Greeks yeah
exactly it's like how dare you create
democracy who created currency there
next how would we exchange goods
exchange pins okay I guess that's
currency dammit it's part that fits the
definition of currency for this outfit I
chose these chunky sold combat boots
fishnet stockings a distressed plaid
skirt this Sex Pistols t-shirt this
black leather moto jacket a dog collar
necklace and as I mentioned before a few
strategic safety pins and band pins
maybe it was like how many shows you
would went to or just like how many
bands you wanted to rep those it got a
Boy Scout back yeah punks doubts and for
my makeup I was inspired by Siouxsie
Sioux of Siouxsie Sioux and the Banshees
who was a major style icon of the London
punk scene Punk fashion and music leans
heavily on nostalgia for 1950s rock and
roll bringing back elements like the
greasers leather motorcycle jackets and
straight leg denim jeans but this time
they were distressed and repurposed
almost as if the punks had dragged them
out of their proverbial great yam and
now kiss I feel like I really look the
part but I'm not doing so good at acting
the part
yeah
argh or in general the aesthetic of punk
was all about shock value facial
piercings of many varieties bold makeup
vertical hair ripped pants plaid pants
no pants and an abundance of metal
chains though some commonalities emerged
the general style theme was just DIY or
go naked and you did take one of these
off and make it an earring how much can
you feel your hair in the wind I can
feel it looks feel like a giant cotton
ball it looks like you ain't got
involved this hairstyle in particular is
inspired by images of women attending
punk music shows as well as everyday
street looks yes my goal is to make you
several inches taller today I'm doing a
wig first so I can get the hair slightly
shorter to give me a better chance at
fully defying gravity
how much geology putting this thing
already Kaleigh all the gel I had all
the gel and though many Punk's had
shorter hair it seems like longer hair
could also be styled straight up or in
some kind of orb around your head like
the 80s here is kind of like restoration
England and this one is kind of like
pre-revolution France needs make a very
counterculture twist on Rococo yeah
good I like that attitude switch though
it was new in the 70s the punk aesthetic
is a pretty timeless counterculture look
something that is kind of interesting to
me is how similar that this look is to
my 2007 like emo slash scene work like
it's just I feel like I'm like them all
I'm just like dropping out emo babies
left and right most people avoided me in
this outfit sugar spikes
everything nice but besides that I did
very much enjoy kicking stuff with my
thick-soled combat boots consider
yourself lucky that could have been your
Shinya don't kick me and head-banging in
hot topic I was so nervous to head bang
because I thought that it would like to
get rid of all the height but maybe in
fact that's what it needs oh yeah that's
how you do by yourself yeah exactly you
just put all the gel in it and then you
come was like creating a blender you're
like a place that's no doubt many old
school Punk's would not frequent but
they arguably helped build for my final
outfit I jump suited up for a night on
the town disco look it is a little
before dusk so it is a little early for
disco fever but the Sun shall soon be
setting the 1970s going outlook traded
in the miniskirts of the 60s for
full-length dresses flared pants and
jeans and other easy to groove in garb
I feel like this outfit is very much
made for dancing but not necessarily for
going to the bathroom and not really for
much else for this outfit I'm wearing a
black jumpsuit with a halter top flared
leg and teardrop-shaped cutouts a gold
brooch golden dancing sandals a gold
purse and these golden black accessories
inspired by disco icons like Donna
Summer Diana Ross and a little bit of
the Bee Gees I don't know what I'm doing
I've lost the beat for my makeup I chose
this bright blue eyeshadow blush and lip
gloss I think I've already eaten my lip
gloss off but the eye shadows still
there I haven't eaten that yet no for my
hair we went for the full fare of flip
my hair is faceting the way just like a
fountain that is being released from a
faucet I'm just
workfare foster in there somewhere it's
really not work it's no it's coming
across there you go farrah fawcett a
Charlie's Angel and style icon had a
very specific wide layered look but in
general for disco hair the bigger and
curlier the better for this look Kaley
found a full diagram of how to get the
exact fare a flip from the curls to the
wings to the feathery feathery bangs I'm
not exactly sure what types of moves I
should be doing I feel like the only one
I really know is this one
yeah it's classic this right this one
feels like I'm grooving to the windows
to the wall this went down
although discos were known for their
anything-goes mentality dance by herself
dance naked ride a white horse tonight I
decided to go out with a disco partner
for Tyler's outfit we went full John
Travolta and we watched him from the
hair to the red blouse to the flared
pants all the way down to the super tall
platform dancing shoes and all the way
back up to the exposed chest hair Tyler
what are you eating good we couldn't
find a real disco club nearby but there
was a roller disco that was open on a
Monday night so we went to go try out
some of our moves it's time to boogie
the disco scene was going strong in 1977
with the opening of studio 54 in New
York and the massive success of the
movie Saturday Night Fever I'm ready I'm
very bad
but a few short years earlier it was
more of an underground movement disco
finds its roots in the gay club scene of
New York in the late 1960s originally as
a place where many people from different
marginalized communities would get
together and dance it out but by the
middle of the decade
disco became mainstream
here baby
and growing to be a four billion dollar
industry with over 10,000 discotheques
open across America by 1978
the roller disco in particular was an
emblem of the late 70s it seems like
roller skating in general became popular
and so we all had the idea that bringing
the two together would be a match made
in heaven regardless it was the closest
we could find to a true disco club as
well as a great place to showcase me
almost falling on my ass multiple times
and there was a disco ball so I think it
counts I didn't do that great but I
can't exactly I didn't fall we got a
good dance it in there yeah exactly I
would definitely do this again I would
come back for sure yeah so those were my
1977 outfits an additional bonus outfit
that I've been wearing the entire time
is this jumpsuit that my mom bought and
believed she wore in 1977 she and my
grandma also sent a couple of other
outfits that they believe are late 70s
and maybe early 80s
overall I really enjoyed styling outfits
around the 1977 aesthetic of all the
things in these looks there definitely
is some stuff that's in style today to
be honest the punk outfit is something
that people would and do wear pretty
much from head to toe today and I also
think that a lot of retailers are
referencing the 70s in their fall and
winter clothing lines for me I'd like to
bring back the ascot I was walking so
much purpose my Ascot just blew open and
also the rollerskates I wasn't very good
at it but I feel like I could get better
and again I could always use more chest
hair from Tyler I do like the John
Travolta hair but I mostly like the
Tyler hair and by that I mean chest hair
