video today I'm going to be dressing
like we did a decade ago in 2007 2007
was the year that brought us the iPhone
Rihanna's Umbrella oh don't taze me bro
mean and V beckons to America while
YouTube was celebrating its second
birthday
people were donning tiny vests and
jumping ship from MySpace to Facebook in
regards to what we were wearing it was a
year of high-waisted jeans headbands and
hair dye I was also a human in 2007 it
was 10 years ago so I was 14 going on 15
and I remember the year quite vividly so
I definitely have my own biases about
what I remember it being the iconic
fashions of the day so I'm sorry if I
missed anything and I definitely did
miss some things there's no way I got
everything but after going through some
old Facebook photos and doing some
research I think I managed to put
together three outfits that mirror some
of the iconic Styles at the time also
I'm going to be focusing mainly on
American fashion trends so I'm sure some
of these were kind of international as
well alright
2007 what happened and what we wore so
for my first outfit I was inspired by
what I remember wearing during the
summer of 2007 as well as some of my
favorite TV shows of the time Gossip
Girl and the hills I think that in this
outfit I kind of did like a mash-up of a
lot of the trends from 2007 in one in
2007 there was a resurgence of 1950s
inspired looks including baby doll and
trapeze style dresses bright colors were
also a trend that year so I chose this
teal baby doll tunic style dress this
tunic also has a little bit of a banded
bottom to get that fluffy bubble hem
effect you're catching up to me
and he's our walk back with the tunic
topic hit that that's mid thigh because
you're always going to be wearing
leggings or jeans underneath wearing
leggings under things is how I got away
with wearing a lot of short dresses and
skirts throughout high school but
leggings were also a huge trend of the
mid to late 2000 I love cross legged I
want to just wear more of these just
like under dresses because then you
don't have to shave your whole body
ballet flats were a big trend of the
spring of 2007 again mirroring a 1950s
style I used to walk for miles and
ballet and my fuels completely raw all
my pants oh my god it's wet could you
see though I was not a huge headband
wearer myself there's no question that
2007 was a year of head accessories and
if you guys didn't see I do have like
for me from the bottom of my husband's
yeah I tied that yeah Tyler Tyler
expertly tie bows and finally I also
chose this large bag as an omage - the
giant bag trend big bags were in
partially because celebrities used to
tote around their small dogs in them he
looks so comfortable in there he
actually doesn't look that mad I think
he likes it but I also suspect it was to
carry around all the gadgets you needed
and all their respective Chargers what
is that something even worse that is my
phone from 2008 but I still feel like
account so for my makeup I was inspired
by the covers of the seventeen
magazine's I have here lip gloss was
everywhere in the 2000s everyone's just
wearing lip gloss I went for some gold
eyeshadow inspired by the covergirl
eyeshadow that I used to use every
single day in the spring semester of my
freshman year of high school which was
like light gold and dark gold G and a
and sun's about to go down so I'm
getting the last few rays I can with my
what would you call these just like
giant bug glasses they're very bug like
I think I am standing out a little bit
just because my teal tunic
so bright but I think like in terms of
amongst other people I don't stand out
that much 2007 was only ten years ago
after all but I think that you can see
the stark difference when I stand near
the mannequins of like storefronts at
the mall fit right in I definitely think
that this outfit has probably the most
personal bias in it just because I feel
like this is like probably the closest
to an outfit that I would have worn in
2007 I do remember one episode of the
hills specifically where the characters
were getting Pinkberry and I as a
teenager in Chicago do not have access
to a Pinkberry and definitely want one
so fulfilling dreams right here in
Glendale California
I just drop your strawberry and my giant
back for my second outfit I decided to
go for a look inspired by Ciara Fergie
Jessica Simpson and pretty much anyone
who hopped on the high-waisted wide-leg
jean trend so I call this look Ciara
hosting TRL the public had mixed
reactions to this trend Jessica Simpson
was notoriously criticized for her
attempt at wearing the high-waisted
jeans nevertheless many celebrities
runways and fashion magazines
wholeheartedly embraced the high-waisted
Jean
Trent nose holes and the needs to be
found amici snow an accidental skin
exposure I am covered from bellybutton
to ankle I paired it with this white
button-down top going for the office
wear vibe that was in fashion in 2007 I
apologize for the wrinkles on the blouse
this is straight out of the Amazon bag
this trend included or was at least
adjacent to the oft referenced late mm
cropped vest which I did not include in
this outfit here's a picture of me and a
little vest from 2008 to make it up to
you the belt and the shoes I chose to
add a little bit of color to the outfit
wedges were in fashion that year and any
type of waist cinching belt be it skinny
or wide was pretty prevalent religious
would it when gentleman tell me whatever
just died I was inspired by this cover
of Marie Claire magazine for my makeup
look this is Anne Hathaway post Devil
Wears Prada and pre becoming Jane she's
got like a kind of nude glossy lip going
on and a very subtle smoky eye so I put
on some like a tingling lip gloss like
some pulsing lip gloss and it is making
it a little bit hard to talk if you
understand me I can understand you but
you sound like you just came to the
dentist just a little bit really hello
there's something about both of the in
2007 outfits even though this one's a
little more adult than the last
that's very like bright and cheery kind
of like fresh-faced glassy licked a
couple bright colors you know nailed it
I didn't do much to my hair in this
outfit but if you want just imagine some
like straight across blunt bangs does
this work at all
I can't see me tie it look at the office
or you want to go in and take pictures
of photobooth this is not a look that I
would have rocked in 2007 though I do
remember wearing a lot of button-down
shirts over tank tops but I thought
that'd be high-waisted pants trend
deserved a nod today 2007 interestingly
the high-rise Jean trend was a complete
180 from the early 2000s trend of the
ultra low-rise jeans so how did jeans go
so quickly from this to this part of it
is probably just the fashion cycle but
it's interesting to know to the
celebrity pop culture timeline of that
year 2007 was an unfortunate year for a
lot of celebrities many unflattering
stories and pictures were published of
these celebrities partying getting
arrested and exiting cars without
underwear on a lot of iconic celebrities
went to rehab during this year and Vice
even went so far as to call 2007 the
year of the celebrity car crash
Time magazine stated that ladylike
dressing from grandma's closet was
popular in 2007 and that celebrities
were using it to shore up their image
and fashion blog site 2007 as a year of
modest dressing I can't say for sure but
looking back it does seem like the
sudden rise of these jeans was
associated with a reaction against the
fashions of the early to mid-2000s
okay so this is outfit number three this
last outfit is inspired by the scene and
email fashion from the mid to late 2008
LZ pink hair extensions as a nod to the
guide hair of the scene movement ha ha
ha am i cutting my real hair oh my god
there definitely some of my real hairs
in their shoes I chose this Fall Out Boy
t-shirt 2007 one
here for Fall Out Boy so feels
appropriate I also chose this studded
belt which i think is pretty iconic to
look hot topic actually sells these
things like who you first walk in
they're still like well stop they're
still around I didn't know one of these
belts before this video but I always
kind of wanted one and I think it's a
keeper I'm enjoying it so far the skirt
and fishnets were inspired by Avril
Lavigne's look during her best dancing
era and I also chose these knee-high
skull printed socks to complement the
type these low-rise black and white
converse we're a pretty common footwear
choice my only issue with the converse
is that they're not worn down or written
on enough let me help you out here I
also chose these black and white striped
arm warmers which were inspired by Avril
17 cover right here I got you from eBay
they're kind of tight on my thumbs so my
thumbs we're kind of getting cold you
know like I'm putting on circulation a
little bit I went for playing Foundation
and heavy eye makeup and very little lip
makeup also this backpack is not really
inspired by anything I saw in 2007 this
is actually a backpack that I currently
own and use but it felt right so we're
just go into this I did not bring my
sunglasses because I felt like if I was
ever encountered with the Sun today I
should just like switch emotionally here
are some photos that you guys sent me on
Twitter that capture the aesthetics of
the email and scene kid movement of the
late 2000 from these Styles to the
makeup to the camera angles thank you
guys and let's bask in this myspace
glory we've gotta take a selfie got it I
know that Wikipedia isn't the be-all
end-all of sources as your English
teacher will probably tell you but the
Wikipedia page for the seen fashion
trend heavily credits the internet for
its spread specifically hair and makeup
tutorials on YouTube and MySpace
I think 2007 was like a fully like
internet through and age like a lot of
people could find pictures of other
people on Facebook on my face on
art on Flickr you could have a whole
fashion movement that was completely
outside of like what was sold and like
the new Sam you know here's a super
quick bonus outfit shout out to my mom
who sent me some of my actual clothes
from the late-2000s besides the tunic
top and leggings look from the first
outfit I was very into medium washed
flare jeans and long torso tops like
this one and don't forget the even
longer tank top to layer underneath this
top and these flowery converts are 100%
authentic to my freshman and sophomore
years of high school she also sent me
some bottoms but those do not fit
anymore the one thing that I didn't
quite get right this week are the
eyebrows I didn't want to plug them I
spent so much time trying to grow them
back in I just I couldn't do it so just
know that 2006-2007 were the years when
I first tried to murder my eyebrows it
was really fun to try and style some
looks around the 2007 aesthetic and
looking back I do think that 2007 was a
kind of transition year in terms of
fashion with a lot of the trends being
pretty different from the early to mid
2000s one of the things I wanted to find
out is if there was anything from the
year 2007 that I want to bring back from
the outfits I tried on I would love to
continue wearing three-quarter length
cropped leggings I like those things
they're fun and you only have to shave
half your leg the studded belt though I
don't think it's out of fashion as hot
topic still definitely sells them like a
right as you walk in and these are flare
jeans that I've been wearing since the
Bowness outfit these are not my actual
flared jeans from 2007 as I said I don't
fit into those anymore so I did buy
flare jeans for this video and they're
very comfortable I've been wearing them
for days I think some of the other
styles will probably see come back in
the next few years I think right now
we're really pulling from like the late
90s early 2000s and reviving those
trends so let's say 5 years we might see
some 2007 styles back in action I don't
know I'm just guessing maybe the
headbands will come back once more thank
you guys so much for watching I'd love
