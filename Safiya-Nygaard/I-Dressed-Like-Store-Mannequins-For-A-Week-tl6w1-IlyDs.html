video this week I'm going to be dressing
like seven different store mannequins
now I'm a bit of an adult mall rat I'm a
big fan of food courts and Teavana
samples and I also worked retail in high
school so needless to say I've spent a
lot of time in malls and I've done a lot
of window shopping
now even though I've seen quite a few
mannequins in my time I've never wanted
to buy the entire outfit a mannequin is
wearing or even most of it I find that
mannequin outfits can be pretty
over-the-top they tend to have a lot of
elements and they seem kind of hard to
wear but I've always been interested by
them because beyond showing you the
newest stuff that a store has mannequins
are supposed to display some idea of a
store's brand identity and their
interpretation of the newest fashion
trends so I'm curious to see how
mannequin outfits from different stores
all generally marketed to my demographic
will compare to each other
what are different stores doing to get
me to stop and have me go inside okay
let's bring on the mannequins
it's a classic mannequin challenge so
our first mannequin outfit was from
forever 21 I just have to myself in the
car window I look like this in the wire
like straight up is this not
Wiremu B+ 14 years I picked this
particular mannequin because of the
amount of things she was wearing and
also because of this hat it looks like
your head has a lip piercing my heart
has three lip piercings thank you very
much this outfit was like medium
difficult to find in the store the
jacket and the skirt required some help
I'm not sure if it was like from the
back or just like in some strange corner
but we needed help from some sales
associates to find them and then the
sweater was a little bit disguised
because on the mannequin it looks like a
cropped sweater but in person it's
actually a full-length sweater they just
like rolled it up okay we've been out
here for like five minutes and I'm
already very hot if you're like
forever21
dope straight to fall and it's not quite
fall yet there's very little exposed
skin if the mannequin was wearing it you
have to be wearing it so from forever21
s website
part of their mission statement is to be
always changing and always in style and
the fall trends they say that they're
keeping up with our denim vintage vibes
and jewel tones which are all pretty
well represented here I'm not sure if
it's all cohesive together but it's all
here but I'm just you know walking
straight ahead thinking about put one
the other I don't actually think that
forever21 intends people to wear all the
stuff together and in fact I'm not even
sure that forever21 intends for this all
to be an outfit together I feeling
they're just putting a lot of eye
catching things on one mannequin in the
hopes that you'll see one thing you like
and then walk in the store and try to
find it I skinned Elmo
this how many times have you almost
fallen 75 so this next mannequin outfit
is from Urban Outfitters it's like
you're almost wearing pajamas I
definitely feel very comfortable like
I'm wearing pajamas
kind of like a silk Fiamma I chose this
mannequin because there were no other
mannequins at the store that we went to
this was literally the only mannequin in
the window of the store your flannel is
almost a cape
you're like the hipster Cape Crusader I
used to see people in the store it was
quite easy to find the pants the
necklace and the flannel which were all
like gnarly together but like nearby the
mannequin and then the bra and the shoes
were a little more hidden so maybe
they're assuming that like not everyone
wants to bear their midriff with like an
open bralette but they make the rest of
the outfit pretty readily available I am
a little bit aware of the fact that like
my you know Taylor Swift belly
just an interesting choice would fall
just to be like stop spreading the news
on the Urban Outfitters websites they
described their fall trends as that 70s
look and get cozy I don't see anything
70s about this but I do feel pretty cozy
it's kind of like slightly risque pages
you look so comfortable yes this is like
my desired aesthetic a little bit like
I'm so comfortable that I learned
pyjamas and the world is my bedroom
and you're all just in it to take your
shoes off so the day three mannequin
outfit was from Zara not this outfit
needed anything more but I brought my
own sunglasses that I feel like go with
the look it's kind of like an
psychedelic acid tripping eighties
skiing dream
I picked this mannequin because she was
pretty much front and center in the
window display and also because of these
yellow poof's they're a very bright
color and they're very hard to miss
right cheerful sunny yellow happy
happiness this outfit was very scattered
in the store the top and the bottom were
together in like a back corner but the
jacket and the shoes were not even on
the sales floor like we had to have
someone help us to get them from the
back and the socks were not sold by Zara
apparently there's actually someone who
comes in and styles the mannequins for
Zara and she brought her own personal
socks as an outfit on my body
it is like kind of fun to wear just
because there's so much happening but at
the same time like it's a little
impractical and like a
I just I feel like a Christmas tree
almost like I'm like really decked out
so from their website they describe
their fall aesthetic as retro fiction
this outfit at first glance is kind of
retro but it's very hard to place it is
a little bit like a fever dream from the
60s 70s and 80s in a way it's kind of
like oh so outlandish and crazy it kind
of all goes together it'd be hard to
argue at this for fashion shipment it
was just kind of like well I say it it
like
I don't know I don't know I would maybe
wear it all together again though
because there is something fun about the
effect even though I look like a giant
LSD taking friend of a muppet how you
handle in the going uphill
so my day for mannequin outfit was from
Francesca's you bought this outfit
recently yeah hey look something you
wear usually yes it does
it's kind of like a yuppie Morticia I
picked this mannequin mostly because of
the sleeves on this top and also because
this outfit was one of the more styled
mannequins in the window I did add these
boots though because the mannequin
didn't have any shoes it's kinda like a
date night outfit what a day right now
in the store these items were actually
pretty easy to find they were not close
to each other or all together so I don't
know that they were like actually trying
to sell them as an entire look together
in the store but they were at least in
the store you're joking now but I'm not
jumping into their to get you the outfit
is to normal so now you have to actually
do strap it in did you drop it and drop
my bag in them so Francesca's really
tries to present all their stores like
mini boutiques
even though they are like a pretty big
retailer I feel like the mannequins that
other stores are a little more wild and
then once you walk into the actual store
the clothes are even if they're trendy
like more normal or wearable and I feel
like at Francesca's it's a little more
like what you see is what you get like
the mannequins are pretty normal and
wearable and inside the clothes are
pretty normal and wearable I think
that's like their intent just be like
are you afraid of crazy mannequins come
in here will shelter you for me my
favorite part of the outfit has to be
the tiered bell sleeve but I did
actually like the whole outfit and I
think I would wear this all together
again in a normal situation I felt like
this outfit
instagrammed it not for the video do
people think it's for the video people
are dressing behind with it you know no
one's super suspicious about it so so my
day five mannequin outfit was from H&amp;amp;M
there was like a bow on you yeah like
old prison I picked this mannequin
mostly because this shirt seemed very
interesting and also because I had seen
this mannequin at other hmm stores so
when I saw it again I was like they're
really trying to sell me this outfit
like let's see what it's like my
perception of H&amp;amp;M is that they have more
work appropriate clothing more like
basics a little more subtle stuff than
somewhere like forever 21 but they do
have trendy stuff as well and often
times I feel like they fuse the two
together so you get like this type of
shirt which is like a twist on office
wear the outfit itself was very easy to
find in the store I think it was one of
the only stores were the first thing
when you walk in was this so they do
kind of have this like interesting
strange boost
you might have never seen before but
they do actually want you to buy and
wear except for the shoes which are
displayed only which is interesting
because they were like the most
part of the outfit so they were just
like the shoes you probably already have
but this is what you want so on hmm
swept sight they describe their Fall
collection as power glam sass which
makes sense with this outfit because
it's kind of like working lady office
woman I'm decently comfortable I love
the pants actually to be honest the
shirt is fine
it's a little bit strange around the
boob area and I wonder what someone with
larger boobs would do because I've got
pretty small boobs and it's even a
little tight across it's kind of a cool
effect but I almost wish they were
separate pieces you know oh I didn't see
you that I can let it fly to fly in the
wind
they're almost like bat wings
so my day6 mannequin outfit was from
Hollister we're down at the beach today
because Hollister is supposed to be kind
of like a beachy company like beach wear
so we're here even though I don't
necessarily feel super beachy in this
outfit
now I actually didn't anticipate on
getting anything from Hollister I
actually used to work there from 2010 to
2011 but when I walked by I was so
surprised by the mannequins mostly
because they didn't look like anything I
would think that Hollister would sell
that I had to get something I mean it's
kind of lovingly but it looks like a
pimp costume
I picked this outfit mostly because of
the fuzzy jacket like everyone else
Hollister is going with shearling for
fall 2017 we're all just gonna look like
very colourful sheep I think you would
look very much like Macklemore and
yeah it's truly a transformative jacket
how's it working with the rest of my
outfit not bad from what I'll remember
Hollister's brand was distinctly focused
on California style Beach wear but this
outfit feels like they're going in a
different direction I feel like the
theme of this outfit is unlike they're
kind of pretending that it's not
Hollister there's no like brand name no
graphics no
just like you could be wearing anything
for anywhere they don't say anything
super specific about their fall trends
but they are kind of pushing this
narrative that the co in Hollister Co
stands for comfort which kind of makes
sense because it seems like with this
outfit we're veering away from the beach
and into the bedroom do you think I
might get dirty but it looks like
something that would actually like turn
gray a little bit like it's very
comfortable but I would not recommend
putting this in the sand this is perfect
for like doing grocery shopping and that
type of stuff cause it's like indoor
will shield you from the refrigeration
aspect good point no dirt no sand just
groceries I found my people nailed it
so my final mannequin outfit was from
Topshop are you going
I picked this mannequin mostly because
of the pants the pants really stood out
to me because of their impressive height
and length and width this is where my
bra ends and this is my crotch so you
know it's full abdomen when I saw them I
was like no way
they're like wearable clown pants
do it this outfit was not super easy to
find in the store nothing was really
close together the shoes I had to get
from online but everything else was kind
of scattered throughout the like
multiple floors so I feel like with top
shops mannequins they're not really
trying to show you like a super wearable
or like everyday look but they're trying
to show you some like cohesive stylish
look that they've like put together
they're not just like throwing a bunch
of things at the wall and hoping that
you'll want to buy one thing they're
kind of just like marketing like their
taste so from top shops websites they
say that they try and stay ahead of the
style game and they designate coats
fuzzy stuff denim modern utility and
jeans as fall trends which I actually
see in some of the other outfits that I
wore this week I feel like actually this
is one of the only outfits without
something fuzzy oh I was thinking about
it we're gonna turn around in these long
and like stiletto boot not bad watch
yourself my only complaint with the
outfit is that they put this kind of
like interesting top underneath all of
these other items I think they're kind
of just trying to like throw like maybe
another expensive item into the mix
where like you could have probably just
put like a plain shirt under there and
it would have been a similar effect
you're gonna fall over in those things
you know I'm really testing my limits
here I don't know about that I would say
that my favorite part of the outfit was
the pants I also liked the denim jacket
and the non prescription glasses I've
never worn any before and they actually
make my vision worse but I like the look
so that was my week dressing like a
store mannequin given that it is the
turn of the season it is fun to see what
some of these big retailers think that
the fall trends are but I was definitely
surprised by a couple of things firstly
by how much faux fur and shearling there
was everywhere I feel
oh so fluffy and also how difficult it
was to find all of the individual items
because a lot of them were very
scattered and some of them were not even
available on the store floor I figured
that the outfits weren't that wearable
but I was actually surprised by how
unwearable the stores seemed to also
think they were there are some
exceptions to this like H&amp;amp;M kind of
Francesca's maybe kind of Hollister even
but for the most part it's just an
attention game all in all it was a fun
week dressing like store mannequins but
I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to
other people there were some
uncomfortable moments you know
mannequins don't have to walk on
cobblestones or sit in cars and you also
end up with a lot of accessories that
you don't really know what to do with
but at the end of the day I think it's
usually more fun to have agency and
dress like you want to dress versus
dressing like a beacon for window
