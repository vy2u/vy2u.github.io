video today I'm going to be undergoing a
little bit of a dramatic wardrobe
transformation I'm going to get dressed
head-to-toe in pastel one of the major
trends of the last couple of years has
been the emergence of this color dubbed
millennial pink millennial pink is like
a dusty muted pastel pink and apparently
Millennials wear it because it's called
millennial pink I've also noticed
recently that other pastel colors are
like coming into fashion like I was at
the mall the other day and I just walked
into a store and I was bombarded by just
like very soft bright you did pretty
pastel colors and I was just like as you
guys might know I don't have a lot of
colors in my closet I mostly go for a
few variations on like a very very dark
grey or black color so I don't have a
lot of options for this pastel makeover
in my closet so I asked my friend
Lindsay who is a stylist and youtuber if
she had any pastel clothes that I could
borrow and she said yes she has a few
different pastel outfit options for me
I'm going to go over there try them on
choose one and then wear it around for
the rest of the day okay let's go get
pastels
all right wearing all dark colors as per
usual about to get high and L eyes I
feel like you're going to look like the
character from the candy line box ooh
Queen Frostine know who's the other one
candy land lady that one okay guys here
is my friend Lindsay she's a youtuber
and a stylist and so she has thankfully
agreed to help me out in my quest to
become a pastel color I'm going to dip
you in pink so as a stylist what are
your thoughts on like the Millennial
pink like pastel trend I have a theory
about millennial pink I feel like it's
the gray of pink it's not baby pink it's
not bright pink it's kind of that gray
area that in-between that I think is
universally appealing to everyone it's
weird how to snuck in there it did
wormed its way and all the sudden it's
on my body this is basically what
millennial pages
like to is poor this is the gray of pink
you know it's a little sin code it's a
little darker pastel is this very chic
little blue draft I do kind of like
those easily are you going to the other
side you're healing what dominates I'm
having strange feelings this is nice -
this is kind of in that baby pink that
subdued muted pink shade I kind of think
this is kind of cool let's try them both
going on we're going to try this one
this one you love I think about the
shape of it both to me I really liked it
and then we've got this one way sparkly
pink and sparkly which is like really
the opposite of what I've got going on
right now and then our this is our
millennial pink all right let's do this
let's do it you look done ha ha ha you
look like a Disney Princess right now I
feel like Carrie Bradshaw yeah yeah well
there's a lot of elements going on right
now
Holly why I like the shimmer right now I
love the shoes I will say I do like the
shoes too I think the shoes are super
they're keeper I feel just like very
naughty yeah exactly very sweet and I
feel like I like me with something else
yeah I feel like it's you and I know
we're really putting you in something
that's totally different
but I don't know there's something
that's not connecting can you put the
glasses on the glasses is everything
that's where all the personality lives
yes
well let's switch up the dress let's
here in something else they really want
to tie this everything in together so
we're we've totally won you over and
plus these tops you can't do anything in
them yeah I don't see this bitch's play
I'm ready
alright I'm going to set the blue one on
next and we'll see whoo
so blue why are you watching yeah why
are you walking like that I don't know
I'm just like a little sideways walking
on crab I love this and you know what
I'm going to do is everyone just put I'm
not a bow girl let's tone it down looks
like just do a little pie I like you and
then do it cool I like it too something
about the sleeve that's a little
dramatic but also like a little bit like
a bird yeah it's kind of like a short
bell sleeve and then it's a wrap dress
which is really flattering but it's very
blue
please bury blue yes definitely not
black oh I don't know I have feelings
good one yeah I'm good and we have one
more we have one one more oh nice I kind
of like this one too
it's a simplistic like sundress shape so
it's nothing too crazy I feel like
honestly of the three that you've worn
this feels like you I agree this and
there's something that just sinks
together right now I feel really
comfortable I think that we found a
winner yeah well big beep so happy
remember earlier we talked or I talked
about you swap with the Ukraine yes yeah
I think that you acute it I think it's
your color okay so we have one element
left and that's makeup so Lindsay's
going to join us we're going to get
maybe a little eye shadow something on
the lips just something to really add
that pastel head or face to toe element
okay let's do it I'm moving my stuff
over from my backpack feels like a
passing of the torch somehow okay so
what do you think we're going to be
going for it there let's just see what's
there but I think we're going to do
something that's nothing
okay great to throw it off a little a
little contrast any of these
were you going for this one is that what
you coming yeah the unicorn purple I
mean I'm down oh and how about a mint
green eyeliner yes okay so we got a halt
I am going to put this on we're in the
bathroom at the mall but it gorgeous
really really nice I'm just gonna -
these guys on a little nice shave yeah
it's more muted than it looks like in
the tooth I think that it kind of almost
I look my face looks like an upside down
flower you know it's got like a stem and
then like a little sort of like a little
yeah yeah I like it though I kind of
feel like I would wear this lip color in
different situations okay so let's get
the head out very busy weakness you know
I think usually equipped me as much like
to be eclectic and the rest of the day
okay I lie
J Lindsay overall I'm pretty comfortable
the dress is pretty comfortable the
shoes are pretty comfortable
everything's going well so far in fact I
think I found a place I can call home in
the candy store right here and it seems
to match my aesthetic is like half cell
7
this is a rose a gummy bear which you
can match me like perfectly my caramel
no so as Lindsay said this dress that I
chose it's pretty much the Millennial
pink color now this color also called
tumblr pink which makes sense to me
because I associate the rise of this
color heavily with the internet has been
popular for a few years now
like with rose gold iPhone Rose a
champagne and rosy grapefruits on period
panty ads it's pretty much taken over
and brands have definitely started to
note it and use it in many a marketing
campaigns
one thing about millennial pink is that
because it's so soft and kind of
neutrals it looks great with other
pastel colors not only is this mixed
pastel aesthetic being seen more and
more on the Internet ie unicorn toast
mermaid hair pastel edit on tumblr but
there are also some prominent examples
for mainstream media including Wes
Anderson's grand Budapest hotel Drake's
hotline bling' music videos and both a
pastel pink and a pastel blue were
featured as Pantone color of the year of
2016 they usually only pick one of those
so it does seem like millennial or
tumblr pink is the gateway pastel to
other pastel colors and now their
popularity is being reflected in
mainstream retail stores and Starbucks I
feel like human fashion and Frappuccino
fashion has kind of been just like
slowly converging I'm pretty sure we're
going to just dress ads frappuccinos
soon okay so we're gonna go get some
food I'm gonna try very hard not because
we have to go back to little Sony
because usually I wear darker enough and
I can just kind of rub it in and be very
careful I'm eating over my plate like
this so far that some
winning strategies are the only crafts
own differences wearing lighter or
darker clothing
I think it might be because there a lot
of like kids and teens at the mall today
and feel kind of like school's out for
me like I'm like I'm wearing a really
summery outfit like a really summery
color like a really summery lipstick so
I'm kind of feeling like what kind of
more jovial I'm like summer break here
we go
I think that Lindsay left me with like a
complete look I'm still itching for
something
I wonder if Lindsay would murder me if I
got like a little like baseball hat or a
dad area be head to toe exactly
so in forever 21 right now it's like
half-cells looking like baby please a
little bit of more enjoyment as well
look it's like quiet like sorta sad
quite rightly clearly at least in
forever21
the pastels are coming so I was
interested in learning more about the
history of pastels in general so
historically trendsetters and
fashionistas were members of royal
courts and pastel colors weren't really
in style among that crowd until the
rokoko period which began in France in
the 18th century it was at its height in
the early to mid 1700s and lasted pretty
much until the end of the century
Rococo art was characterized by a lavish
intricate and asymmetric style as well
as a near exclusive use of pastel colors
this movement influenced paintings but
also architecture decor and fashion in
the fashion realm a key trendsetter was
Madame de Pompadour who was the chief
mistress of King Louie the 15th I can't
pronounce anything in French I'm very
sorry she was a big fan of pastel colors
and notably used a combination of a pink
dress and a blue dress to get the Kings
attention to begin with
sound familiar Pantone man of course you
can't draw the line perfectly but you
know she was an influential member of
court loved pastels bada-bing bada-boom
we're all wearing I'm wearing him you're
wearing him the cakes wearing them the
buildings wearing him the paintings
wearing them we're all aware enough that
is a pretty significant 180 from your
usual aesthetic the times are a-changing
I don't know if my wardrobe will be a
change in but learned is black in this
now there's black straps on those bags
over there a couple there's a couple
cops look what do you think you like a
hat let's do it yeah I got some cat
litter
Krusty's pooped it out trendy cat mom's
that's why I call myself you all let's
have like Amy Poehler for Mean Girls 5
right now you've got PBS so that was my
head-to-toe transformation I had a great
time changing up my style exploring
millennial pink and pastels in general
it was a big change for me because my
wardrobe is mostly dark colors as I
probably said about a thousand times in
this video I'm not sure if I'm
completely converted yet I do like the
accessories I like the shoes I like the
Hat so maybe we'll see some accessories
worked in you know just to kind of
accent to the darker wardrobe I feel
like I have a few theories about pastel
colors and pink that I was trying to
piece together hopefully some of it made
sense there's not necessarily a lot of
causation but there's a decent amount of
correlation thank you guys so much for
