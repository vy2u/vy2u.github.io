video this week I'm gonna be getting a
makeover in three different US cities so
I've been curious to see how style
varies in different places and in this
case I want to see how it varies in
different regions of the US so to do
this I chose three different cities that
are all pretty far away from each other
pretty big and pretty different and I've
also never been to any of them before so
we're gonna be traveling to these three
cities and teaming up with a local who
can help show us their hometown stylist
now of course you can't boil down an
entire city style into just one outfit
but we're gonna try and get a sense of
the general vibes and feel of the city
so three cities three looks let's do
this so the first stop on our trip was
Miami Florida in Miami we stayed in
South Beach which is super fun but I
think self-identifies as a touristy area
we saw a lot of swimsuits swimsuit cover
ups pastel buildings and in general
soaked in a lot of Miami Vice vibes and
for our Miami inspired outfit we met up
with Kelly sax a local fashion blogger
who agreed to show us the ropes hi I'm
Kelly sack born and raised here in Miami
I'm a local fashion blogger and wardrobe
stylist and today we are at vocal hunter
which is one of my very favorite stores
in all of Miami and we are in the heart
of Winwood okay Kelly so we're here in
our first store where should we begin
with this outfit you tell me where are
we going for all of the outfits I wanted
an everyday street wear look that drew
on the characteristics of the city but
also something that wasn't just like an
evening gown something that somebody
could wear on a day-to-day basis so boho
Hunter is a really special store it was
started by five girlfriends in there
from all over Latin America and they
basically brought their favorite
designers from their countries here in
one boutique
I love these bags this is a bad right
yeah almost looks like a lantern yeah
they're like art pieces honestly they're
so gorgeous you can Miami style is very
heavily influenced by a lot in America
we are the Gateway to Latin America
so it's spicy it's sexy and it's vibrant
I think I realized pretty quickly I
wasn't gonna be leaving Miami with an
all-black outfit I am obviously a little
out of my element with lots of color
this is something that is so not
uniquely but very Miami the
off-the-shoulder buffle top this is a
staple for Miami girls you have to have
at least one and in my case probably
like 20 shall we try it yeah definitely
maybe some pants or a skirt to go with
it no no no the junii bottom oh bikini
bottom
okay Kelly might have been joking there
but I think there were a lot of things
that were actually meant to be paired
with swimsuits this is a little bit
sheer so to me this would be maybe more
of a cover-up like if you're on the
beach you can wear this to grab lunch
over your bikini oh and they actually
have a matching baby right here we also
picked up a couple of two-piece
patterned sets but it's just like
daytime pajamas all right that sounds up
my alley it sounds a queer with heels
because if not it's just like way too
pajama not Birkenstocks you know I think
we have a good selection let's see oh
yeah I wouldn't we definitely I've full
so we finally headed to the fitting room
this is going very slowly the curtain is
not drawing quickly that's supposed to
be dramatic yes we ended up having a
bunch of different options to choose
from the pajamas this is pretty cool
makes me look a little tan which is
confusing and Kelly also brought over
some eye-catching accessories of which I
really loved this straw crossbody bag
and almost got stuck inside of this gold
bangle wait no I got it of all of the
things we tried on my favorite was the
white and blue 2-piece set it's a little
like Princess Jasmine to me I think it's
because of the roundness of the pant and
it's very Miami the fabric is really
lightweight you can do this with your
flats I won't make you wear heels with
this I can wear Birkenstocks with this
let me get him
we also bopped over to another store
nearby just so Kelly could show us the
full range of miami fashion okay so we
are at style Macchio it is owned by one
of my dear friends Simona and not just
because she's my friend but she has some
pretty cool ship style mafia had less of
the Latin American inspired Beach wear
and was filled with more just
generally interesting edgy pieces but it
was cool to see a homegrown Miami brand
and we quickly collected a giant pile of
things to try on it's happened so fast
good you look like 10 minute Kelly is a
professional some of which had those
bright colors and tropical vibes Kelly
had talked about earlier and some of
which didn't I feel like straight-up
medieval maybe more Renaissance II than
medieval to be fair but you know
something but in the end we decided to
go with our favorite from boho Hunter
the two-piece set your princess jasmine
moments exactly and we also got the like
straw crossbody the must-have piece so I
also asked Kelly how to complete our
head to toe Miami transformation so for
shoes I would do like a pretty sandal
maybe even something metallic like a
gold for your makeup I would keep it
glowy dewy with a little bit of lip
gloss a little mascara highlight awesome
well thank you so much Kelly this is
such an awesome outfit I'm so glad you
came to me and Ally Tyler at home next
time we'll have a girls night so with
our hall from boho Hunter in hand we
found the final pieces of the outfit
shopping around our hotel in South Beach
and then the next day we were ready to
take our outfit out on the town okay so
this is my Miami inspired outfit so part
of the hope was that I might blend in as
a local but unfortunately it happened to
be one of the coldest days in recent
memory so I was pretty much the only one
dumb enough to wear head to toe linen
there's a nice breeze flowing through
it's not necessarily the most welcome
breeze but I feel like on any other day
in Miami it would be the outfit included
the two-piece suit and straw bag that we
got with Kelly as well as gold sandals a
gold bangle these sunglasses and this
minimal but highlighted makeup look I
don't know if you can see the highlight
because I can't see the screen but
there's some on there and I think
besides the fact that it was freezing
the items went pretty well together the
bow also stops the bag from falling off
you shall not pass
is what the bow says to the bag one of
my favorite items was the pants which
were sort of spacious like MC Hammer
pants something about the pants are kind
of like horizontal so I keep traveling
this way I think this outfit does
incorporate a lot of the things that
Kelly said was iconic about Miami street
fashion definitely the fabric and the
pattern has given me some beachy vibes I
almost feel like someone's umbrella I'm
honestly excited to get this outfit back
to LA because I feel like it would also
work well on a West Coast beach and 364
days out of the year it's probably a
perfect outfit for Miami
right now you look how I want the
weather to feel ditto here's your parka
back this is the bomb cyclone I don't
know when this videos coming out but
it's early January and the East Coast is
being buffeted by a cold wind so our
next stop was Dallas Texas in Dallas we
stayed in the Uptown neighborhood which
is sort of young urban professional II
it's got a lot of shops and restaurants
and seemingly a decent amount of happy
hours but for our Dallas inspired outfit
we met up with local fashion blogger
Aimee havens hi I'm Aimee havens and I'm
the fashion lifestyle blogger behind
Dallas wardrobe calm today we're at
market in Highland Park Village which is
a personal favorite store of mine it's
located in the heart of Dallas fun fact
about Highland Park Village where this
store market is it was one of the first
shopping centers in America all right
Amy where should we begin with our
Dallas inspired outfit I say we should
begin right where we are right now with
these women mazing shirts I would say
Dallas style is classic sophisticated
with just a tiny bit of edge these
shirts look great they're very soft as I
stroke the entirety of them with my
whole arm it looks very as you said like
classic but it also looks really put
together and it would go perfect with
some denim because Dallas is all about
that denim so to satisfy the Dallas
demand for denim amy armed us with a
large supply of jeans to go into the
fitting room a dumpster of denim a
tangle of denim like a multiple denims
like a gaggle of geese
she also wanted to make sure we had the
right boots
to complement her jeans both as any
boots are so common I almost wore mine
today so no cowboy boots stuff I mean
but she was very clear on the fact that
even though jeans and boots were very
popular in Dallas Cowboys were not
unless you're talking about the football
team you will not see a horse anywhere
in these parts so with our horse
sighting dreams dashed we moved on to
the accessories we're on the earring
mission
Amy's found some that are almost
identical to hers what are you talking
about these are way different in Dallas
I think accessories are so important to
your outfit because you can take the
simplest outfit and just throw on like a
beautiful earring or a fun bracelet or a
cool necklace and it completes the look
everything's bigger in Texas so you wear
two pairs of sunglasses before heading
into the fitting room Amy also threw a
couple of frocks my way now you need a
party dress oh okay are we partying no
but we can wear a dress and look like we
just went to one so with our jeans and
dresses in hand we started to try them
all on okay when you come out you have
to say howdy
I'll try maybe even throw in a yawl
howdy y'all did I do it right first we
went for all the different separates we
had pulled and I think indeed denim on
denim I did look a little bit like a
cowgirl
like an uptown cowgirl that's the
unwritten Billy Joel song yeah but in
the sweater I looked a little bit more
like Amy hello my name's Amy how are you
but in my opinion the stripey
button-down top captured the classic
look amy was talking about the most I
like this outfit honestly and I think
she approved Dallas boom so after the
separates we tried on a few of the party
dresses that amy picked out tada
whoa baby you look like you're out of a
Western yeah a little like a saloon ish
yeah baby so excited about that but in
the end even though the saloon vibes
were hard to say no to we went for the
classic stripy button-down top and a
pair of Amy's favorite earrings I feel
like the gray ones maybe you'll be able
to see in my hair what do you think I
mean were you born and raised and
sexist how do you know y'all was that a
good how do y'all the best I ever heard
okay so we've got her shirt and our
earrings and I've got my marching orders
for jeans and over-the-knee brown boots
what else should we do to like complete
the look like what do you think for like
makeup or anything like that
I would say maybe like a cold tote you
can kind of do a few different things
with makeup I would say kind of more of
like a nude lip and a soft eye and
bronzer I think we can pull that off
totally Kim okay awesome thank you so
much baby this is great fun shopping
with you and I'm so excited to make you
more Dallas E so after parting ways with
Amy we went to the North Park shopping
center to get the rest of the outfit and
with those items we were ready to
explore the city okay so this is my
Dallas inspired outfit so in the end the
outfit included the earrings and the
shirt from Market and the jeans boots
and tote we bought from the mall and for
my makeup as Amy suggested I went for a
nude lip color a soft eye and a decent
amount of bronzer overall I think that
the stars of this outfit were the boots
which I liked very much but I don't
think they liked me just tying up my
boots again
come on time and of course the earrings
I keep being reminded that they're there
when they sort of fluff up against my
sideburns he's here to take the contour
off my hairy face so first we took our
outfit around the Uptown neighborhood
where we were staying where we found a
canine Cantina which awoke something
inside of me
someone must have two dogs or an extra
dog you want to go this way that's
somebody's dog is a collar on him so
before I stole someone's dog I just I
feel like it would go really well with
the outfit Tyler quickly swept me away
to the bishop arts neighborhood south of
downtown it was described to me as a
hipster II part of town but it looks
super cool a lot of good brick walls
that I want to stand in front of I'm
sorry I do think that this outfit that
we put together fix Amy's classic with
an edge description I think that like
the earrings definitely bring that
little extra something and I think also
the height of the boos it seems the
boots are a little higher and the
earrings a little fluffier in Texas and
besides the style tips Amy did teach me
one other thing that's stuck howdy y'all
oh they're gonna get kicked out of Texas
howdy friends howdy
welcome to another video oh my god so
for our third and final stop we headed
to Portland Oregon we were on the Oregon
Trail so we stayed in the Pearl district
on the west side of Portland near
downtown Portland is divided by a big
river in the middle so you have an east
side and a west side and a lot of
bridges in between and for our Portland
inspired outfit we met up with Tanya
Smith who is the blogger behind the
moptop my name is Tanya Smith and I'm a
fashion blogger here in Portland Oregon
we are at the house of vintage on
Hawthorne Street it's a really popular
place for locals to go and go thrifting
Hawkins Street is on the east side of
the city
next to a dormant volcano Mount Tabor I
know things about Portland Wikipedia
told me those things okay Tanya so thank
you for helping us out today we're here
in this giant vintage store where should
we begin with our Portland outfit 2f9
flannels flannels I feel like this is
more like 80s prom wear
yeah how do you find the flannels here
but somewhere Portland is very
sustainable as a city so I feel like
drifting kind of goes hand in hand with
that a lot of the people that live here
like to go thrifting because they can
find one-of-a-kind pieces that you can't
find you know at any other store so yeah
very Portland II
so as we beelined for flannels I could
already tell it was a popular choice we
have already seen two flannels in the
store already on people and we quickly
found them off of people as well all
right so what's like the quintessential
color in my head it's red red maybe
green all right so with a flannel what
would you put it with denim denim and
some rugged boots because there's so
many like places in Portland that you
can go on hikes or go out in nature I
feel like in the vintage store we kept
falling into the next item we did so
before I knew it we were just in a
mountain of geez I feel like you need
Levi's the cool thing about these ones
is they have that like rustic look on
them there's all a lot of people in
Portland that ride motorcycles mopeds
and that sort of thing so I feel like
that kind of goes with their look also
with these fit me so somebody once told
me that if you wrap around the waist
around your neck and it fits then it
means that the jeans are gonna fit you
straight all right these wrap around my
neck so after finding some flannels and
some jeans we began searching for a
vintage graphic teeth that was really
cool underneath the flannels Tyler is a
big fan of this he keeps asking me to
just bring it out
we also spotted some denim jackets so
that could be kind of cool to like with
the denim this and then this it seems
like denim is also pretty popular in
Portland would you wear that much denim
you think I would but overall it has a
bit of a different feel from the denim
from Dallas so I feel like Portland is
everyday transition to hike than wear
this to the bar there you go there you
go that's all I wanted cool this is
great stuff though should we try these
on
yeah it's too so with our pile of things
we found ourselves in the fitting room
once again and the lumberjack vibes were
plentiful I feel pretty rugged hey Jack
I look like you're gonna let go chop
some wood I think out of all the
flannels the green one was Tonya's and
my favorite and I did manage to get
myself into this button-fly actually I
fought it I don't know if we'll ever be
able to get me out again so I think
we're gonna have to buy these in but it
and she really liked the denim Sherpa
jacket too Safiye big Billy from
stranger
yes so do you think we should get both
like the flannel and the jacket I think
so I feel like you could like layer I'm
together to just layers layer on layer
on there so we went with both of them
but skipped on the Donald Duck graphic
tee to each their own there's so many
out there that will love that so I think
he's right there Who am I kidding
we've definitely bought it but just not
for this video we still needed a graphic
tee for this outfit though so we headed
to another vintage store to continue the
search we are at red light which is just
down the street from where we were
before let's check it out so the first
t-shirt we found was for me bikes and
whiskey ice that is very importantly yes
and the second t-shirt we found was for
tanya is that Backstreet Boy yeah you
know that is a vintage band too but I
think we both thought that a lighter
colored t-shirt would work best under
the green flannel we saw this the who
shirt from across the room and it's
pretty legit we need it and in the end
we went with that one so I think that
we've got most of the outfit here so to
complete the outfit what do you think I
should do for like makeup and or a bag
um I would definitely say overall kind
of like for your face natural look if
you want to go kind of out of the box
maybe like a cat eye I like doing that
and then for the bag I would say
definitely like a tooled leather bag
crossbody that way you know it's just
easy to kind of like walk around with
awesome well thank you Tanya yeah thank
you guys so much
yeah hey I represented Portland well I
think you did a great job I'm excited to
get on the mountain yeah you'll be ready
after picking up the finishing touches
on Northwest 23rd Avenue we were ready
to hit the town and the trails this is
mountain mama mountain trolls
yeah okay so this is our Portland
inspired outfit this outfit includes our
flannel sure Pat jacket boots and
button-fly jeans that I'm never getting
off as well as this graphic tee
crossbody bag and casual but I'll I nerd
make up look there's a lot of denim
going on for sure I do like that there's
like you know some dirt details yes so
yeah I've been on this mountain for
years I think we were capturing that
Portland outdoorsy feel even if I'm not
really equipped for mountain life hi
Sofia if you run into a brown bear what
do you do yell fetal position
oh I'd read you a black bear what do you
do know they get big you see me you yell
so as Tonya suggested we got the sharp
edge a c't and the flannel to sort of
like trade off or in the case of the
mountain you could just wear them all at
the same time
right now we have bundled Safi both
layers are you cold well you're off the
man and I think as Tonya hoped we were
able to transition from mountain to
coffee shop to bookstore pretty easily
yeah they're gonna take the whose shirt
away from you and our exploration of the
city was aided by the fact that it
miraculously for January and Portland
wasn't raining we've heard it's good
weather in Portland this weekend so I
think we're you know getting some nice
dry flannel times yeah but we couldn't
hike around for too long because we had
a flight to catch
true the airport yes all right let's go
running late
all right so those were my three
different city makeovers of the three
cities
I think Miami had the most different
style with its bright colors and
patterns and sort of swimsuit cover-ups
that is a slip all the way up the side
but though Dallas and Portland were a
little more similar in that they both
favored jeans
I think they had pretty different
attitudes towards their denim with
Dallas being more clean-cut and Portland
having more of a biker slash hiker feel
so after traveling 2752 miles we ended
up with three outfits that were pretty
unique and different from each other and
that each told a little bit of
a story of the city they were from but
despite all of those miles traveled
somehow the exact same weather followed
us wherever we went so we went to Miami
and it was cold and now we're in
Portland and it's nice and warm but the
plot twist is that it was exactly the
same temperature in both cities and the
second plot twist is that it was pretty
much the same temperature in Dallas as
well all three cities the same
temperature like 55 and sunny yeah thank
you guys so much for watching and a big
thank you to Kelly Amy and Tonya I've
put their links in the description below
