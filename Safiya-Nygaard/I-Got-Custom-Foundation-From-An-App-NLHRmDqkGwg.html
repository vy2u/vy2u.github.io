video today I'm going to be ordering a
custom foundation from an iPhone app yes
that's right folks this is the future
have you seen passengers kind of like
that I never sought passengers so
basically there's an app called match Co
which claims to be able to scan through
your iPhone camera like your wrist and
your neck and your forehead and from
that information they take that they
make you a custom Foundation and then
they send it to you for 49 bucks which
is expensive for foundation but if it is
like the most perfect foundation it
could be worth it I think that my skin
tone is like medium difficult to find
foundation for it's not too hard but
it's also not super easy I have like a
kind of light tone especially right now
as I am like coming out of the winter
you know that's when we get the peak
aged parchment beige envelope kind of
feel so I'm going to scan my skin order
the foundation today and then when it
gets here I'm going to try it out for
you guys and we'll wear it all day long
to see you know if it stays if it gets
shiny I'm a big shiny at the end of day
kind of gal I'm really really curious to
see if it's possible to get that custom
foundation like disembodied ly like you
don't even know you haven't even seen me
can you make me a custom foundation
shall we try it okay so I my computer
plugged into my phone so I can record
the app and what it does nesco go how to
scan click you'll need to be in a room
free of natural and direct sunlight pull
the hair away from your face in forehead
giorgia make sure your makeup free ok
cool
so we're joined by this friend who has a
very soothing yet insistent voice I
don't have any makeup on besides my
lipstick and my eyebrow thing which is
probably be fine indoor lighting check
five sheets of white paper check my
whole purpose excuse me
cousin of series right now
scan first your phone camera needs to be
calibrated against a stack of flat white
paper gently start to tap or make sure
you're holding the phone level make sure
you're holding the phone level 1 - sure
you're holding the phone level I'm
trying
now let's scan your inner and outer
wrist place your palm up and tap until I
ask you to stop or if dress is touching
your skin it's got a lot to say oh wow
that just went from zero for really
quick outer is next turn your palm over
and gently start to tap lightly until I
ask you to stop
draw your that working gently start to
tap about one chest every second cap
slightly until I ask you to start let's
begin your forehead skin yeah feels a
little alien abduction e-series yellow
red light you just like a laser right
here with my head forehead skin is now
complete let's begin scanning your right
cheek oh well it went without me
touching it okay alright I understand
you don't like being called evil theory
position the back camera against a
middle of your left cheek you're doing
great
thank you I'm sorry I called you evil
Siri
evil series congratulations your scan is
now complete oh wow okay so that was it
so it shows me actually the foundation
that I'm going to get it's called the
match code my perfect complexion custom
tinted hydrating formula exclusively
formulated for Sofia mango Lisbon with
when they're scanning your I was sa
brain when they're scanning your
forehead it does kind of feel like
you're taking memories out for the pen
thief and then insistent slightly evil
theories like gaming your memories and
stuff maybe evil don't judge the theory
by their cover maybe you guys and we're
okay we'll see when I get this
foundation but we're okay alright so I
am going to order this thing and then
when it gets here we're going to try it
on and I'll wear it for the rest of the
day and see how it wears next time you
see me I'll have a custom foundation
okay so the package has arrived
oh wow it is schmancy or federal card
what's your this is okay gimme all
coupons like that it's glass it's a good
weight Oh in the back its Oz has
exclusively formulated for Sofia Nygaard
again and then it has a QR code at the
bottom maybe if you wanted to reorder
this exact shade you'd be able to like
Spanish or something that seems pretty
cool
okay so I just left on some haphazard
brows and then put a little bit of color
correcting fluid under my eyes so I'm
going to try on my foundation now I see
if it matches me and then also see how
it wears throughout the day all right
here's the squirt
oh there it is oh there's your blows oh
just suck my nose in it doesn't smell
like much it's kind of exciting
like evil Syria and I made this
foundation together so now we get to try
it out okay
it's a little light I think first
impression but it feels quite nice
actually as it sits on my face I think
it's turning pretty much exactly my face
color but it does feel like a little bit
lighter than I would usually go for
foundation so maybe it's just telling me
that I'm doing something wrong or you
shouldn't cover my moustache so I'm not
into wax a few days so here is one coat
of my custom foundation I'm adding a
little bit of baking powder on and like
try and set the foundation because it's
very hydrating which is nice right now
but at the end of the day will I be a
bottle olive oil I will say that when I
bring out the double chin there's no
color difference so that's that's
probably a good thing I think it looks
pretty good right now I did powder it
down a bit which I do with all of my
foundation so far this is an expensive
foundation and I think that the color
did match me pretty well I just want to
see if it's worth the luxury foundation
price in terms of the wear and tear the
question is do me trust evil theory and
my answer is like maybe maybe we do
sitting in a hot car I've only been in
the hot car for a few minutes but the
foundation has been on my face for a
couple of hours I'm feeling a little bit
of a
on my upper lip and on my forehead but I
think the foundation still looks pretty
good
so this is my face in natural light I
don't know why like in some places I
feel like I look paler than in other
places
I think what's settle on the fact that
the color was pretty good but it was
just a reality check I usually go for a
foundation that's like a little bit more
tan yeah and this is like the truly the
lightest colors of your face are this
color right so I'm just not used to it
you know okay so four hours in in-person
I think it's a little bit powdery if
that makes sense but like honestly on
camera I'm not mad about it
so maybe evil Siri is fine instead of
evil Siri we should call her more
helpful Siri because real theory cannot
understand me I also never asked her for
anything and then she pops up anyway and
I'm like nobody asks you Siri oh that's
right now what kind of foundation we're
good
at you pretty well it uses Bing it put
it how to pick the right foundation for
your skin how to choose and use the
right foundation oprah.com hey Siri can
you scan my face
now you know the answer might be too
close did she tell me she's like I have
been doing it for years but can you
stand my face recovery what kind of
foundation I should do
to me kikuchi says yeah let me see okay
we're just getting home after a long day
of who even knows what I think it's well
not pretty well it's not super oily at
all I'm not hydrated I don't actually
feel that hydrated I'm pretty impressed
by how long it lasted I'm just trying to
figure out if it's worth it for me I
can't tell it like that it's different
at all really yes I mean like I think
the color match is pretty solid for at
the very least not noticeable by a
knowledgeable boy friends okay so I'll
swatch my foundation so we can see them
side-by-side this is the one that I got
with an app this first one and then this
is my makeup forever one and then this
is my next BB cream obviously this is
maybe a little bit thicker than like how
you would actually put it on your face
but I guess the question here is did the
app not detect any yellow undertones or
am i Pinker than I think I am
interesting the question is who is right
so it is the end of the day it is
actually kind of late at night and it's
time for me to go to bed so I'm bout to
take my foundation off or all of my
makeup but you know the foundation
specifically I did initially bake with
setting powder but I haven't repowered
myself since then so like this is the
damage with my combination skin over
those 10 hours compared to other
foundations I use I think that this one
held up just as well as those ones it
does look lighter than the other
foundations that I use but I think
that's because I haven't gotten a lot of
Sun recently I spend a lot of a lot of
time in my cave man but I think it did
match my current skin color correctly so
if you're someone who has problems
finding a foundation that matches your
skin tone this could be really awesome
and I do think it was a nice foundation
it gave me a nice medium coverage like
it is lasts for a decent amount of time
it is $50 though which is definitely on
the expensive side for foundations I'm a
little undecided I'm just not like yes
but I'm not like it didn't work I think
it worked so now we can we can
officially call our previously dubbed
evil Siri more helpful theory
listen Syria honestly stop trying to
activate yourself on my computer stop it
I know you can hear me
