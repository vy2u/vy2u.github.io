video today I'm going to be getting
perfectly fitted jeans from an app yes
that's right folks an app is about to
measure my booty this is the future that
I signed up for so basically what I have
here is a box with a pair of smart
leggings and a corresponding iPhone app
and basically I'm going to put these
leggings on the leggings are going to
measure my booty and other parts with
some electrodes or some things then
they're going to bluetooth that
information to the app the app is going
to take my measurements and search
through their database and then
recommend me a few pairs of what should
be perfectly fitted jeans I would say I
have a medium difficult time finding
jeans that fit me
I feel like besides fluctuating sizes
between brands I also fluctuate sizes on
my body a decent amount depending on the
time of the month the time of the year
the time spent editing in my cave so I'm
interested to see if this thing can just
tell me what's going on
at any given moment I'd be interested to
see if this thing started catching on
where all this booty measuring info was
being stored and how I could get access
to said info all right this is the like
a glove pair of smart leggings and so
we've got some instructions here and
then we've got our pair of smart loking
okay let's see what's going on over here
what they are that I think that's the
electrode those do we do things lxq but
yes so one yeah don't touch it yet I
mean this thing is is the legging of the
future these little stitches are the
measuring bands I'm pretty sure
and then this are you ready for this
this is the measuring homing device it's
beeping look at that is you looking at
us
maybe recording us right now it does
look kind like the Eye of Sauron if I
hold it like this it just keeps blinking
little heartbeat never trust anything
that can sync for itself if you can't
see where it keeps his brain since
Arthur Weasley quote it's what he told
Ginny before she you know started
communicating with the Dark Lord hello
it's a Horcrux you in there okay I think
we should try this on mmm
didn't it look cool I call it
moving because you've kind of got like a
quilted aspect to it your moles office
so basically you've got the measuring
bands that kind of sit on like your
upper waist upper hips lower hips and
then you know the Luce I've connected my
phone to the computer so we can screen
report it I've got my app like a glove
it says to please share your height so
we may estimate your jeans link i
fluctuate between five nine and five pen
I'm going to go with five ten just
because my legs are a little bit
proportionately longer than the rest of
my body you do a leg pan up yes sensual
they say we want to get to know you even
better please share two of your favorite
denim brands and their sizes so we can
learn your fit preference all right so
let's take a look at this selection I
don't own a lot of jeans from these
brands I own a pair of American Eagle
genes that are size 8 that I really like
so let's go with that
right I wore Levi's before I only
remember I'm just going to say I know
that 29 is a size 8 so I'm just going to
go with it please share your weight and
age let's get 154 pounds and I still
have a few days left of being 24 so I'm
going to do two the last hurrah alright
so we've got a little bit of tutorial
here looks great I measure myself then
they give me a catalog and then I love
it
alright let's try it ahhh leggings
should sit as mid-rise jeans they say so
let's you know make sure that they're
sitting either underneath they're not
covered in my belly button so okay so I
have to turn on my homing device click
measure and then stand very still
my on it's flash all right I'm going to
put the phone down on a quick measure
and then I'm going to be as still as
possible cannot move I was doing
something oh it's guy got an error
message wants right again yeah let's try
it again right stand very still this
time I'm going to click measure Gary
stop
I got the same message I kind of think
it comes it's plugged in why don't we
try without it being plugged in so we've
unplugged it so we can do the screen
recording really quick but we're going
to record on the camera so you'll be
able to see goes on I measure it up it's
doing something
are you working did it work did it work
I think it did oh my god here we are
Here I am there are measurements there's
my bootylicious and now we've got our
recommendation so it looks like we have
a lot of five-star matches which is
supposed to be like really good fit
matches we kind of have more than a lot
I was expecting a few specific five-star
matches but it looks like we have at
least a hundred even here right at the
top of the list they're going high-rise
mid rise straight leg skinny legs flare
like they're all over the place I would
be interested in trying on like a
one-star fit just to see like what the
different qualifications are for what
they think is a perfectly fitted Jean
but I can't even find like a four-star
fit like these are all 5 it feels kind
of like they're going through every
brand they have and every gene that
every brand they have has they're not
really being like this one fits your
body better ok so I'm going to pick a
few of these 5 star matches right at the
top I'm going to go for different price
points and slightly different styles but
still styles that I would like to wear
to try and figure out what this whole
five star thing mean because if they're
all 5 stars
then they should all be very good yes at
the very least perfectly fitted or just
molded to the booty
ok there's been a couple of weeks I've
caught a little bit of a cold but we do
have our three pairs of perfectly fitted
jeans here so I've got my old Navy jeans
my Levi's jeans and my Lucky Brand Jean
all right let's open these up and try
them on I'm ready my booties ready
that's a new fence all right here is
pair numero uno tags and all tag mellow
man I think they feel sturdy and like
serious can you feel the glitter boxing
focus the waistband is I own
little bit tight but like not
uncomfortable when it's definitely like
I'm feeling it like it's not super
stretching they feel it they could be
really comfortable after I wore them for
a while here is pair number two they
look a little tight they're very high
rise so you do get like a little bit of
this small gene effect in the front
these aren't uncomfortable but they are
pretty tight this a little more like
through late into one there are a lot of
spandex in these like I might even call
the jegging and pad number three I think
that there's a little bit of like
awkward edge right at the bottom there
just a tiny bit loop and also a hair
short and I kind of wish they were like
one or the other there's not a lot of
like booty lifting action not that
bootylicious now and it's funny how long
this difference but besides that that is
a gigantic zipper great why is it so
mommy setting overall they all fit like
it will not see me I wouldn't say that
any of them are perfect panels are not
sure with the app mean by five dollars
because they're all I'm pretty different
besides the difference in style like
there's differences in but coverage
there differences in thigh tockman
differences in zipper length so you'd
say that they can cater to your style
but I don't see that they would
recommend a cut that they think that
little good on they know all the stuff
about my booty someone knows out there
but I want to give them another shot and
try and run a couple of tests to see if
they fit me better than my normal jeans
in like common uncomfortable jean
situation
here and the
from roll
is the test and yet there's a good
client or the card class this is our set
Wow three years and I thought it would
be alright let's go for it
oh you ready yes so I hope it is got
doctor rhythm and eczema stretch like I
said earlier looking like jegging i said
earlier this mellitus dirtiest fabric
and filled with dirt it kind of getting
pushed back again upon his bones
Elias Gotham pretty goofy my one issue
is that what I do forward my walking
there I feel to wait in you just a
pieces oh we all just the second test of
the chair
if it fits hi Shelton
oh okay
I'm fully covered in the back nope
little situation yeah that's a very high
rise yeah even though the mid rise does
sighs as I sit down after digging
the back did move down but my track is
safely to the front I can have to adjust
a little bit it is a little bit
uncomfortable okay let's get one a
muffin top what do you think you are
right now they all did pretty well but I
wouldn't say that they were a revelation
I do still think that they are all my
size but they all have their own small
issues there weren't any glaring issues
with any of them like I could wear these
jeans and be pretty comfortable but were
they perfect no
so we're home now and as a final little
test I want to throw on a pair of fun
jeans that I wear a lot to compare with
my app recommended jeans just to be like
if there's any market difference I mean
from my remember I think you fit pretty
well I do like these jeans a lot they do
love stretch out a little bit and I also
have washed them in a couple days
there's encrusting hair on it but
besides that I like them either size
eight long from Target Maki no grand oh
oh I like those jeans they're quite
comfortable I have those things too I
mean I would say that the genes that
we've tried on today do have a little
maybe more booty lifting action but they
are also a little bit tighter and even
higher rise I would say that my normal
ones are perfect but I also would say
that they've got something that I like
better to me I recommend so thing
they're all kind of good fit but I don't
think any of them are okay so those were
the three app recommended jeans I mean
three amongst a very long list of
five-star recommended Jean overall I was
expecting a little more of a
recommending aspect I was kind of
expecting that with all the my new
details they have about my hindquarters
that I would learn something new about
what jeans I should be wearing maybe my
expectations were a bit high because it
didn't not work it does measure you and
then it does give you some sizes in
different brands that they think that
you are and the jeans did fit but I
don't think that any new insight was
given like I thought that the app was
going to receive my bootie information
and then be kind of like Stacy and
Clinton from what not to wear and be
like ah you've got a pear-shaped body
type so you should be wearing this
dark-wash wide leg jeans
the mid-rise from this brand
specifically and they were a little more
like we've got 300 pairs of jeans you
are a size 8 in almost all of them check
it out I do think that the database is
cool like I do like the idea of being
able to see my different size in
different brands but in terms of
recommending perfect jeans I feel like
you'd be better off probably doing it
yourself or going into the store and
like asking someone to measure the booty
or you know just give you an eyeball
