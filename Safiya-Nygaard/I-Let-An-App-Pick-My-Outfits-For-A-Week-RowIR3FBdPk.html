video this week I'm gonna have all of my
outfits chosen for me by an app yes this
is concurrently the future and also 1995
so this product called purple or pure
pole is an online closet organizing app
which from their description on the app
store seems to have a lot of different
use cases but most notably claims to be
able to be a virtual stylist that can
suggest you outfits based on your own
clothes that you upload to the app now
when I heard of this I immediately
thought of shares out some clueless
which I guess wasn't exactly an app it
was more of like a PC program but either
way I had to try it now my closet
doesn't even come close to rival and
share Horowitz's but I'm curious to see
what this app can do I have a lot of
black clothing items so I'm not gonna do
my whole normal wardrobe because I think
they'd be a little too easy to match
instead I'm gonna throw in a few pieces
that I wear all of the time a few more
colorful pieces I learned less of the
time and a few items from past videos
that are a little more unconventional
just to see what purple will do with
them okay let's get it on so first I'm
gonna take pictures of all of my clothes
to upload to the app so I think I've got
everything that I want to put into the
purple app right here I think we have
enough stuff I've got like a few of
every category of clothes yeah work it
we might be here for a while
I feel kinda like a mom like taking
photos of their kids like Kim you're
doing amazing sweetie
how many cleaners gonna take of the same
sweater apparently a lot okay so I
finally took like all of my photos of
all my clothes and now you have to
upload them into the app and like give
them some information about it so I'm
going to enter this long black cardigan
this I will add as a sweater there you
go so you can put in a lot of
information about each item occasion
weather rating size color price I think
we should definitely add in like the
color at least I think that to some
degree they must use the photo but I
think any information you
give them a little help so I'm gonna add
in the color for all the things I just
put in which is five bags eight dresses
seven pairs of earrings seven jackets
five pairs of jeans ten necklaces three
pairs of pants 14 pairs of shoes three
pairs of shorts five skirts five
sunglasses and 17 tops so check back
with me in about an hour okay I think
I'm done I ended up pretty much just
doing the colors but I did input
multiple colors in for each item if
there were multiple colors represented
so I'm going to ask it to suggest me an
outfit I'm gonna ask for a bag dress
earrings jacket necklace shoes and
sunglasses and then let's see what it
says oh it's a little bit of a random
outfit but it's definitely a full outfit
Oh interesting
okay so I'm like moving it around it
looks like I can almost like swipe like
tinder that's interesting to note like
maybe we should just swipe around a
little bit just to give it some sense of
my preferences for what I like to wear
but I feel like when it comes to the
week and like actually wearing the
outfits I think I'm just gonna take
their first suggestion right off the bat
just because I want to see what they
want me to wear so starting tomorrow I'm
just gonna ask it for some items of
clothing and then it's gonna suggest me
an outfit and I'm gonna wear it all
right so it's day one of purple choosing
my outfit so let's see what they want me
to wear today so today I'm gonna need a
bag some earrings a jacket pants
necklace susannah top ah okay so this is
my first outfit that they want me to
wear it's interesting cuz it's kind of a
combination of a lot of different colors
and textures I can see some like
consistencies with the iridescent in my
hallo backpack and in my Tivo shoes but
everything else is kind of a little all
over the place
alright let's put it on so this first
outfit I called the Polo and acid wash
soup look besides the acid wash the rest
of the up it's like a little Kim
Possible it is Kim Possible even the
chokers like a little Kim Possible
because of
so you're like this is her hair this is
her top and this is her bottom overall I
actually like this outfit and I'm glad
that purple seems to be a fan of my
platform Tevas which I feel like no one
else likes besides me and now this app
purple so I like those things you've
roasted me before I have roasted you I
love it when my hammer toes are exposed
get at me we can see I'm still not
exactly sure what about it it like
matched together in its computer mind
but I think that to the human eye this
outfit is kind of cool actually I think
between the Kim Possible vibe and the
Tevas and the acid-wash something about
this outfit is kind of like giving me
nostalgia for like the mid 2000 so even
though I'm outside of my comfort zone
color wise I'm very much in my comfort
zone in like pop-culture references I
saw Katie Heron learn on Vincent Eva's
yeah it's not gonna happen stop trying
to make that happens after someone
support me so for my second outfit
purple chose for me this like mashup of
like a rainbow and a dark look the Evie
shirt is back the e t-shirt is back not
necessarily by popular demand but it is
back I think purple definitely match
things by like rainbows today with the
opal earrings and like all the different
colors in this shirt and the holographic
boots so it's kind of going like all the
colors and then black stuff maybe in
their program they're like ah patterned
or like multicolored things go well with
simple basics so they were trying to
like offset the rainbows with some more
simple stuff but that's just a guess
yeah it's hollow bitch I think that
purple did an okay job with this outfit
it was definitely fun to revive the Evy
shirt and the holographic boots but I
think overall the effect was kind of
like I went to an EDM concert yesterday
you're kind of like a rave casual I did
enjoy wearing the outfit though even
though the Evy shirt is by no means a
fan favorite I did enjoy bringing her
out on the town she's making a comeback
here
btv that's in the Eevee's I though sorry
so for my day three outfit purple went
for this pretty simple jeans and a
t-shirt look I'm wearing this like black
t-shirt with whole pocket with malt cat
that flips you off I love that guy and
I'm wearing these flare jeans from the
2007 video I think it was definitely
matching like the black shirt with the
black bag and then interestingly enough
the pink shoes I think with the pink
from the ears of the cat because I made
sure that when I went through inputting
information about all of these items I
put in like every color that was on
there which maybe was a mistake on my
part but I'm think that's what happened
be like a spunky high school beat you do
have a high school vibe to you right now
day three was also a big filming day
it's when we filmed the buying a full
face of makeup blindfolded video so it
was actually pretty coincidental that
purple chose me like a quite comfortable
outfit for that day and I'm very
thankful for that but overall as an
outfit I think it's pretty bare-bones
something that's interesting about the
purple app is that maybe it'll suggest
something that'll X spark some creative
interest you Nemean where you're like
ooh I never thought of putting those
together but with this I'm just kind of
chilling I would definitely wear this
outfit again probably watching TV or
hanging out like on a weekend so it's
pretty late at night and I'm still
wearing my outfit I feel like at this
point I've usually changed into pajamas
of some kind but
I'm pretty comfortable so or should I
say I have pretty medium feelings about
this outfit but I have pretty great
feelings about this little cap so on day
4 purple pulled out my olive green wish
parachute jumpsuit I did put it in the
roster just to see what would happen and
purple wasn't afraid to pull it out yeah
I think purple was like Oh a jumpsuit
and wish was like sort of there are
definitely some through lines in this
outfit I feel like I'm like straddling
the line between like clown the
parachute pant look and like a little
bit of like a disoriented do a leap oh
look I think that the biggest through
line is the floral stuff and there is
some green in the leaves of this jacket
which maybe make sense with why they
chose the green jumpsuit the holographic
backpack I think the thing is like
because it's kind of rainbow they seem
to be putting the holographic stuff with
pretty much anything they want can't
leave your holo at home kids I would say
that overall this outfit is kind of cool
in its own way but I definitely was just
like a shapeless parachute underneath a
bomber jacket oh that's hot that's what
they want in the club usually people
like to wear less clothes
I'd like to wear more I liked it in the
evening breeze it almost acts like a
sail I feel like if you like fell off
like a rather high ledge and you were
wearing this thing
I'd be like a flying squirrel I think
that something about this outfit made me
think like oh maybe I'll wear this
bomber again oh maybe I should wear
these shoes more often but all together
I'm not really sure I pull it off your
butt is like all out right now this is
the atomic wedgie jumpsuit on day five
purple pulled out the acid wash and
hallow combination once again this is
the least dark outfit I've seen you wear
in like the last two years you know kind
of all of the items besides the earrings
are kind of like a white blue or silver
tone i think that the earrings which are
red and gold are a little random for
this outfit but besides that it is kind
of just like a little bit of like a
light wash look I'm like the white swan'
version of myself but usually I'm new
and today I think the purple did a
decent job with this outfit there's
nothing wrong with it I don't think I
stick out I think I only proposed to
come to me the only thing that I didn't
like about wearing it is that I felt
like I had to be really careful when
eating or drinking because usually I'm
wearing a black shirt that if something
spills into it and I can almost just
like rub it in very high
bringing the saucer with you
so on day six purple chose for me this
flowy autumnal look I feel like in
general ready for fall but like LA fall
yeah you could be going like a pumpkin
patch are gonna take me to my go-to
foamy patch wait yeah actually so most
of this outfit is black but they did
throw in this kind of like butternut
squash colored skirt so they've kind of
built up like a black base and then
accented it with a color I feel like a
kooky middle school art teacher yeah
almost like a hip witch that is my
desired aesthetic this was by far my
favorite outfit of the week that purple
chose have you been able to see any
booty no booty yet and let me go to blur
this video all right well just look out
for my only problems with the outfit
were the accessories and the top choice
the accessories were just a little much
and like just almost two giant your
earrings look like they're trying to
catch a television signal I think purple
may have a problem with identifying the
shape or size of things because I don't
think they knew how large these earrings
would be my other small problem with the
outfit is that I really like this
cold-shoulder top but they kind of hid
it underneath this jacket but overall I
really like this outfit and I haven't
worn this skirt in a while but I really
do like it and I kind of forgot that I
had it in a way so it was like a fun
rediscovery of something that I already
own
it's very flowy it's like a paper bag
fell through the wind okay mister again
I would definitely wear this whole
outfit again in fact I would like to
wear it again very soon within the
months of October and November Tyler you
better didn't take me to a pumpkin patch
in this outfit
day 7 marked the return of the hollow
backpack and the cat middle finger guy
purples hollow sexual Kirk was like a
future AI they're like second literally
sexually attracted to holographic
I'm gonna be honest this was a pretty
random outfit especially for the last
day I was like looking for like a grand
finale but like day seven was just kind
of like well it's a little more laundry
day than I think some of the other
outfits have been this week but I think
purple is you know taking a risk trying
to my favorite part is outfit was that I
got to wear this shirt that a subscriber
sent to me because it reminded them of
the ugliest shirt in the world give me
your arm
try to tie me in I'm staking my claim
good this is what I wanted
I would not wear this outfit all
together again but I did like everything
I was wearing like all these pointers
also I don't usually wear these slippers
outside of the house and I maybe should
because they were fun missiles to launch
at Tyler you gotta give me warning do
one more okay so that was my week
wearing purple recommended outfits it
was definitely fun to see what purple
would suggest and also what its favorite
items seemed to be purple is definitely
a hollow sexual The Hollow backpack the
hollow boots the hollow tote bag like
kept coming out it's also really fun to
just swipe through the suggested outfits
it's kind of like your online shopping
but in your own closet so you're not
spending any money my confusion about
the app is that it doesn't seem very
clear what exactly the technology is
supposed to or what it's trying to do I
feel like sometimes it just stumbles
upon a cool outfit and other times it
kind of just gives you uh something I
would be interested to know what the app
can glean from the photos that you give
it because I feel like there's a
possibility that they're just taking the
information that you give it like when
you categorize it and when you tell it
what color it is and just kind of like
spinning it back out I would hope they
have some type of like photo reading
technology but from my experience this
week I can't say for sure yes or no that
they do even if the technology is
potentially pretty basic and the matches
are kind of random I did enjoy using it
I don't think it's perfect at
recommending full outfits but it's
definitely good for a little inspiration
I also have a soft spot for it because
it likes my platform Tevas in my
Birkenstocks and no one else really does
so I'm team purple because purple is
