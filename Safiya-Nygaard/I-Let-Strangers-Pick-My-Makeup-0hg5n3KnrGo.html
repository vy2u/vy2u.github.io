video today I'm going to be asking
strangers to pick out a full face of new
makeup for me a few weeks ago I did a
video at the mall where I had some
stranger's pick out a new outfit for me
and it left me wondering what would
strangers decide to put on my face so
today like last time I'm going to have
different people choose different items
building on each other's choices to
create a complete new makeup look
I'm also coincidentally at that point
with a lot of my makeup where I've run
out of some stuff so I could either
repurchase or try something new so I'm
excited to see what product people
choose and how they decide to build the
look like are they going to be going for
something more wearable like an everyday
look or a more edgy avant-garde look or
are they just going to troll me anything
is possible
really okay let's go so we are on our
way to the mall right now I'm not going
to put like a set price cap on anything
but we'll try and you know stay
reasonable also as a side note I brought
my own brushes Beauty Blender primer and
setting powder because those aren't like
really exciting things to ask someone
else to pick out for me as part of my
looks they're necessary but they're just
not as exciting I feel like last time I
started off with clothes on yeah this
time my face is bare blank again so I'm
naked there's nothing to inspire anyone
there are these a lot of people here
it's time to make some new friends so I
wanted to start off with foundation and
concealer so this is Jessica just going
to help me pick out my foundation and
concealer is there one that you like in
particular no
so Jessica told me that she doesn't have
a lot of experience with makeup but in
general I thought it would be fun to see
what anyone would pick not just people
who know a lot about makeup so this will
be an exciting event yeah it'll be fun
okay perfect so where do you want to go
week no year I actually bumped into
Jessica right outside of the next door
and although she doesn't wear a ton of
makeup
she knew what foundation and concealer
twerk I'm all pale it's true especially
for the summer
Jessica was very decisive I need this
one that's on yeah and picked up mix
foundation which is the total control
drop foundation in the color light then
Jessica went in for the concealer this
one Oh perfect awesome right what do you
think I know how much she picked the HD
studio photogenic concealer and the
color glow I asked her if you wanted to
swatch and she said yeah it'll work and
if anything you can always warm it up
you know with some bronzer later on in
the the project exactly just because
it's like I'm going to leave that for
someone exercise so I got these two and
put them on my face so let's go try it
on shall we
then we've got some mirrors over here
maybe we'll just hijack their setup I
would say directionally their color
matches I think the concealer is
actually quite a good match that looks
like it's gonna work
that looks grainy this foundation I've
never used before and I thought it was
nice kind of like light and watery not
super super full coverage but actually
kind of a nice feeling
no swatching light I think it's like a
little bit pale but like definitely like
my skin tone you and I mean I think you
did a great job a little bronzer is
coming in at Venus yeah see she knows so
for someone who doesn't wear a lot of
makeup and refused to swatch I think
Jessica did a really good job picking
the products and a pretty good job
picking the colors mostly just be
confirm you just have to work quickly
you're amazing high five I guess living
dangerously is the way to go okay so I
did a quick application drop so it's not
quite
what I'm going to do right now is add
some setting powder and then the next
person I'm going to ask for brows and
eye shadow good okay so I'm here with
Victoria and Derek and they're going to
help me pick out some brows and some eye
shadow any what do you guys think I got
Foundation and concealer on I think it
matches pretty well there we go Jessica
did a good job okay cool so where should
we go
probably Sakura Victoria actually had a
little bit more experience with makeup
so for eyeshadow she chose this Urban
Decay eyeshadow in Woodstock okay
awesome this is great which is something
that she doesn't own but she really
wanted to try so I was just like the
human Squatch so we swatched a couple
but we're going to go with Woodstock
Derek what do you think she knows that
all difficult and then he said eyebrow
yeah okay I mean honest obvious handsome
so great I agree
and then for eyebrows she chose her
favorite product which is the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow pomade in the
color ebony I think that works yeah
anybody maybe a little too dark but I
mean I don't thanks a lot I love it this
is stay on your finger like like has
come off now okay it's a nose work okay
so let's try it on let's do the brows
first how about looking at a nice I know
look how fresh it is you want to watch
me destroy it so I think that in the
store I kind of applied the eyebrow
stuff a little bit too heavily just cuz
I'm used to my eyebrow product which is
a little bit on the lighter side oh this
is some serious stuff man wow I don't
know I mean it's like definitely like an
impactful brow when you come him to go a
little heavy-handed and then why
Sharpie never the same now let's going
with some wood stocks you're living out
my dream by putting this on your eyes
sofa a lot of pressure so we could
freeze on the go I just suddenly
transforms in this tutorial what do you
think and Eric how you feelin thank you
I don't wear a ton of eyeshadow but I
really liked the shape do you want me to
go in more heavy with it or do you think
like a lighter touch is better more ya
lephant more special in cream color -
hello I didn't love where I've been what
every night that sounds awesome
Derek remember I think that Victoria
with the help of Derek of course kind of
like set the stage with this bold look
of pink eyeshadow and a bold brow for
future choosers to kind of hold on to
and like style around Derek likes them
there it goes like it I would say Derek
likes it then we're ready to roll Derek
Yolo circle and I think that they did a
great job because both of these products
are great and I think they look really
good in Derek's words in today's
eyebrows and eye shadow okay so I
think Victoria and Derek did a great job
choosing I really like the 16 color I'm
going to sit down and clean up all the
stuff that's happened so far and then
we're going to find someone to help me
pick out some eyeliner and some mascara
so I'm here with Daniel and America and
they're going to help me pick out some
eyeliner and some mascara so when you
guys think of what I've got going on so
far and I really look that G feeling
edgy alright so let's go with that
so Daniel and America - the staff tunic
and started looking around for some edgy
eyeliner and mascara
that one looks great yeah showing us
watch it oh that's fun so Daniel picked
out this NYX glam liner in glam Lagoon I
think in general he was just going for
edgy so I think he was also trying to
match the kind of like summery energy of
the eye shadow yeah
all right we're into this and then some
mascara anything there was a second when
America wanted to put me in some blue
mascara America's Galaga devious look on
her face she's like yes yes we shall but
after looking at what Daniel had picked
she decided to go for something more
classic bow looks cool so she picked up
the badunkadunk lush lashes mascara but
dumb to them into it yeah all right
that's what we're going for
apparently it is but dunk it dunk and
not badonkadonk like I had previously
thought okay so I've got Daniel flam
Lagoon and America but dunker dunk so
let's put these guys on I've never tried
out either of these products and I think
they're both pretty fun this is kind of
Awesome I look like a watermelon it's a
summer watermelon zalga waterville yeah
that attentional Daniel are you hungry
I'm going to you know do one I Foley so
they can see and then I'm going to sit
down and really try and make communion
so this is a badonkadonk I'm also very
glad that we picked up just something
that's just called badonkadonk whoo look
at this sick brunch you like it you
think yeah does it look badonkadonk E or
donkey badunkadunk e said ah I like it
it was good I like it too he's the
badunkadunk all we could have ever
dreamed of yeah okay we've got mascara
and eyeliner chick so next up I had to
do like cheek and face stuff so contour
blush or bronzer and highlights okay so
I bump into Lynette right after we
walked out of the next door so obviously
my other eye has not yet finished but
Lynette is going to help me pick out
some like bronzer blush cheek stuff in
some contour so what do you think of
what I've got going on right now this
side is finished so I love the bright
teal eyeliner so at first Lynette told
me that she doesn't usually contour or
wear a lot of makeup in general besides
lipstick so whatever your heart says
you know we'll deal with or you can go
wild it's like like totally troll me
black and bright red
okay Solan that's taking me to Macy so
we're gonna have a great time see you
got to warm me up a little bit I'm a
little a little on the pale side right
now you get to bring me back to life
okay how can of paint the next as we
started shopping Lynette revealed that
she actually does watch makeup tutorials
fairly often so although she doesn't
contour herself she actually knew a
decent amount about how to do it
type amber gold solid Wow
a lot of we're going we're going and
we're glowing where's that hello hello
blossom one look at that one yeah
so even though we were in Macy's we
somehow couldn't escape the Knicks and
stay on that song yeah all right so
let's get that one
oh and blush we got it all nothing too
bright because your eyes are incredible
my single eye is incredible right so she
picked out the NYX cheek contour palette
in two to tango and the NYX blush in
pink the town and she also picked out
this uh Nastasia Beverly Hills glow kit
in ultimate globe gonna be awesome I
have a couple of these NYX HD blushes
which I really like I haven't tried the
other two products though and I think in
general they were all like nice wearable
colors okay which one did you like the
amber gold amber gold let's go for amber
gold I have heard from some people that
they think this thing is too glittery
and it is a little bit on the glittery
side but sometimes you just need to
glitter but it's happening it's
appearing slowly but surely when it's
inspiring you to do your first
contouring I mean my mom probably won't
allow me but in secret yes cool I think
I think that looks pretty what do you
think you got with more alive yes
awesome
we've got cheeks and stuff check
great job limit backwards high five that
was actually okay that wasn't that bad
at a high five okay yeah so next I was
finally ready for the finishing touch
lipstick so I am here with Tina and
Steven we bumped into them right outside
of Sephora I know I have not had a
chance to finish my other eye but they
are going to help me out and take the
finishing touch so lipstick ignore this
side of my face what do you guys think
of the look I have
on so far I look like a bird I look like
a bird well yeah bird God crab he go oh
I was like a peacock so I think Tina was
inspired to balance out the tropical
vibe of the eyes with a darker lip color
this is like a relief right after here
and yeah you know things I'm sorry beer
at the party on top business on bottom
yeah I know I messed with your eyebrows
sorts you guys only go liquid lipstick
or like a stick if you're mad maybe mad
yeah that would be great so there's some
like matte lipsticks over here as these
guys and these guys so whatever you guys
think could be fun now a few minutes
into our second time film against the
for us they kicked us out so Tyler took
the camera outside and Steven Tina and I
finished picking the lipstick inside so
we like this color which we called
exorcism oh it's going to be a little
darker like maybe come here so the one
on top is Vampira you had like that one
yeah perfect alright let's go with it so
they picked out this Kat Von D
everlasting liquid lipstick in the
colour Vampira ready regardless of how
this goes with the rest of the look I
definitely feel like this is a color
that is up my alley my application
leaves something to be desired
I'll clean it up what do you guys think
in general the idea it's like really
subtle because then there's like not
everything's art like a shadow and
everything's really like three sweet
spicy yeah it looks like a pepper
great thanks guys great job awesome
lipstick the chick okay so this is my
finished look I feel like I look a
little festive like we've got some green
in some red going like Christmas in July
I also feel a little bit like a Olympic
gymnast or synchronized swimmer like
these are the colors of my country's
flag and I'm reppin them with some like
serious waterproof makeup I do also feel
like Stephen said like a bird like or
something bird like about this like got
some feathers and some prey that I'm
holding in my talons I think of all the
products my favorites were the eyeshadow
and the eyeliner I think they're
actually a really fun combination not
necessarily something that I would
choose out for myself
or like wear on a daily basis but I
think they're actually really pretty
though some bold choices were made and
at times I did feel like a human swatch
I didn't feel like any one with trying
to troll like I felt like everyone was
trying to build on the previous choices
to like make something I can't exactly
say what it is
but I don't not like it I think I do
like it so a big thank you to everyone
