video today I'm going to have my outfit
chosen by strangers so I was thinking a
little bit about how I shop for myself
and how I choose outfits I think that I
always do it in the context of what I
usually like to wear and I also don't
really buy like full new outfits of
clothes very often I feel like I usually
shop like item to item so I thought it
would be fun to go to the mall need some
new people and have them pick out a
whole outfit for me without the
constraints that I usually put on myself
when I shop I'm pretty intrigued to see
what people choose like who knows if
I'll come out with this with any items I
can actually wear so I think I'm going
to do it like item at a time so we can
get like a few different people's
perspective a top a bottom some type of
accessory jacket something like that a
shoe or footwear of some kind and then
maybe like face wear an eyeliner or like
a lip color or something to kind of pull
it all together alright I'm ready
Tyler are you ready yeah let's go to the
mall today okay we're on our way to the
mall right now I don't know who we're
going to talk to you today but I hope
that people want to talk to me so I'm
going to try really hard to not insert
any of my own opinions into the mix I am
going to try and have like some type of
loose price constraint I'm just going to
lawyer outside of the reasonably priced
stores and then
be like hey want to close with me I'm
curious also to see how doing it like
one item at a time will affect their
decision-making will they try and like
build the outfit will they try and
misdirect the last item that was chosen
in like pull it in different directions
I don't know okay so I tried to wear
like a pretty nondescript outfit just so
like people wouldn't be like too scared
by what I'm currently wearing so I'm
going to start off with a shirt and then
we're going to go down from the shirt
the first item will like put the Moonies
for the rest of the outfit so the first
people I met were Moriah and Leo they
are like our subjects they pick me out
any type of
okay
we were standing like nearby two hot
topic Solomon they literally beeline
straight for this easy shirt oh wow
that's a good choice I like that I look
like an AG community prison they were
just like Phoebe shirt yes perfect this
is what we want is this a choice leo you
think you guys are in agreement will are
sure you have a very quick and efficient
making well I like Edie there's nothing
not to like about easy even got a lot of
cool evolutions can go in a lot of
different ways here yeah it actually
fits quite well I think it was pretty
cute number one fabulous number two
fabulous number three fabulous same I
have no words like baby it's just
amazing I love hot topic I feel like I
usually buy like top figurines or
keychain type stuff from there but you
know I'm down for an easy shirt
item number one down good job you guys
Thank You Mariah Thank You leo shirt
chin thank you guys
oh my gosh Samara and me overcast is
like getting to be outfit and they
really knew what they want so now
everyone else have some kind of like
shoes around it so it'll be interesting
how Moriah and Leos toys like sheep
this is Liz Liz agrees healthy find some
model all right
we're going to forever 21 yeah wanna
wear charge
whatever you think with any type of
bottom you like you can go the
embarrassing route you can go the trendy
style statement route we did a decent on
of searching on forever 21 before we
found the pair of pants that she likes
so bad like oh yeah I think Liz saw that
the shirt was pretty gold and kind of
went for something that was more muted
and wearable I really like and I can
never find jeans that for me
so my host Alex Bob there's some sort I
have the olive Arizona Idaho okay
awesome
let me try these on really quick and
awesome animal
the dressing rooms right there perfect
campaign
here they are Liz I'm glad you like them
I like you they're pretty fun what you
think let's go eat maybe put a few more
holes in those is like horrific more
open because it was a split second where
she thought about putting me in like
pale pink athletic shorts no interment
is like a workout okay but mercifully
she did not I think this is a good one
to set up the jacket right carry the
jacket and then maybe issues so we'll
look for a couple more yes I could hear
- all right your hands so while we're at
forever 21 once we've gotten the jeans
we met Rebecca Rebecca is going to pick
out in jacket some type of like layering
tosses it over my face off so Rebecca
honestly whatever you feel oh I think
Rebecca kind of took a look at the shirt
and the pants and was like - why not
just go all out ideas over something
like okay go home okay so we're going to
go find some still bigger poem jackets
over there anything yeah she immediately
was like oh I remember seeing some wild
jackets near the front who we went and
found a like very specific wild jacket
that she had remembered while she had
already walked through the store
part of the fossil forest which was this
purple kind of sheer jacket that says
roll with me on the front and back oh I
like that and then on the back once
again roll with me these are all skating
you wear this type of thing Rebecca I
know that's why I'm letting you try it
on there we go
what do you think hey I'm will color by
this time and you can zip it up and
still see the Eevee
Rebecca's like slowly back I didn't do
that why did I sign up for this this is
the one you want to go with Rebecca
all right she's not on it strange jacket
Rebecca nailed and I think I can
anything people like this even though
these are actual kids beat Rebecca by
you still color for it out feel like now
I take a very sensitive boy yes the
jackets really jumped since I don't
really you know like this outfit in a
different direction
like improv exercises like where
everyone messes tell a story like one
word at a time story sometimes goes
but at the end is still a story so next
were Lisa and Isabel who I tasked with
finding me a pair of shoes
we're ignore the work insomnia whatever
you guys think at first the Lisa said
that she wanted to go with sneakers
thinking them freaking out moncelli
jelly so we spent a little bit of time
kind of searching around for some jelly
sandals we walked into Zara and we
almost bought a pair of like blue kind
of plastic like slides with paroled on
them that maybe said jelly I got along
with us and when you look at those like
a lot of wine things but they did not
have any in my size that are even close
you found a pool here she's out there
Alex Lifeson yeah so we're going to try
again we're going to go to H now my
enemy what's going on we were also
joined by their other two sisters who
helped in the hunt
George's Java now I leave it hanging I'm
having a good time there's a wide array
of shoes they're working so something's
going to get we found silver platform
loafers at H&amp;amp;M maybe wanted to go big
they're uh slightly larger one because
I'm down oh yes there were nine and a
half just like clockwork we found that
Muhammad Ali's with either step up yes
Wow for me that you know what do you
think this is a group decision I think
that we have to go to stuff I take the
village chief all in here oh yeah jelly
shoe Restless shit at that point I had
like a pretty complete outfit which was
made up of a lot of like bold items but
weirdly wanted that was yard altogether
how I feel about this whole thing is I
feel like
individual is a great purchase for later
on and then today is just the cherry on
top look at all which is that I get to
wear them all together one once again
you're in pastel Sofia
how does keep happening but I was
wearing like a dark brown lipstick which
was no longer really working with the
aesthetic that was going on I'm thinking
that like the finishing touch should be
like a different lip color I don't know
if you will be the finisher but I'm
excited all right so I'm here with
Jessica she's going to pick out a lip
color for me and kind of just finish off
his outfit what do you think of my
outfit right now Jessica did one look at
the outfit that I had on and was
immediately like unicorn so she had a
really clear vision of what she wanted
we think maybe a performance maybe a
purple woo I might own this at home
wait ago more purple I feel you kind of
like almost like such a match the jacket
but like I got from like purple pink
tones happening
I think Jessica's choice was both easy
and hard I think she had all of the
elements together already so she could
kind of like see what was going on and
go with it but she also had to kind of
like find the thing that would bring it
all together so there was like a
decently high-stakes choice Sun so we
did a little bit of squatching a little
bit of perusing but finally we found the
perfect metallic purple lipstick yeah
yeah let me see if I can find like a
good fresh spot to swatch it look good
just go like that
alright I think we're going to go with
it somebody get these on my hand
and get this off my face Jessica do you
wear purple metallic lipstick often
oh yeah I'm into it what do you think
whole unicorn yes just because like
dubiously she's like yeah it is just as
had a vision came in killed it thank you
and here now is my outfit it's a lie I
feel like I'm wearing a full outfit that
is pretty during different from what I
walked in wearing today this is the
first full-length here we've encountered
so this is my first look at the outfit
altogether I think Jessica did a great
job tying it together with this little
color
I think everyone did a great job you
think that cracks me up is
I would say in general everything's
pretty like out there except for the
pants which are more like muted but I
honestly think that they all work
together kind of because of the pants
I'm going to be honest it's not I think
it's kind of came together in a way I
think that besides the pants none of
these things are things that I would
have chosen for myself but all together
they were pretty fun and also
individually I really like them too
color wise it's pretty consistent I
think that's some what's controlled by
what's in the stores right now are these
kind of like unicorn Frappuccino like
pastel colors and I also think it kind
of shows like what's on people's minds
at the moment and I think that Jessica
like took one look at what I was wearing
was just like oh I know what that is
unicorn I think overall I was just
surprised by how decisive people were
when choosing an outfit for someone else
I'm not sure if that was just people
trying to sort of like get it over with
if they were just tired of shopping with
me or it could be as I think it is that
we are just like less self-conscious
when shopping for other people's deaths
we're just like oh I like that that's
cool you wear it which was kind of a
relief for me it was very stressed for
you I was like okay and I came away with
a fun outfit well a few plan items
together that make some kind of outfit
