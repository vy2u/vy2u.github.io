because you just wish it was a little
different hello friends and welcome to
another video today I'm going to be
ordering free stuff from wish now a
little bit ago I ordered a week's worth
of $5 clothing from wish which is a
low-cost online store that carries a lot
of different stuff from light up shower
heads to wedding dresses the prices seem
a little too good to be true but aside
from the months-long shipping time I was
generally surprised by how much I liked
what I ordered it was a little hit or
miss but there were some gems since then
I have discovered that wish has started
offering items for free or just for the
cost of shipping which leads me to ask
why what are they and what is wrong with
them
I assume that this must be promotional
to get people to try wish or maybe this
is just like leftover stock they're
trying to get rid of but either way I am
curious so I'm gonna go back to wish and
buy the first 5 3 things that I see
there just to get a good sampling of
what they've got alright let's dive back
in and see what we end up with alright
so I've got my screen recording going
let's get to wish calm oh wow I already
see two free things like in the
beginning of my feed
so the first free thing is this sexy
women padded bra letter printed push-up
padded beach yoga sports bra tank tops
so the item itself is free the shipping
is two dollars which is not that bad
okay so there's four stars on two
thousand and five hundred reviews that's
pretty good I don't think these reviews
are for this product because the first
couple of reviews say came on time
grandson loves that we'll be buying more
the other one says the spinner was great
my grandson loved it it was early I'm
gonna guess that this store also sells
fidget spinners
and they're just reviewing the merchant
or you know like leaving reviews on the
wrong product it's just a guess
okay so this comes in three types types
2 &amp;amp; 3 are very similar to each other and
type 1 is completely different so just
taking a look
it looks like type 3 is kind of sexy so
I'm gonna get black type 300 Oh suddenly
it's no longer free it is now $3.00 the
only one that is free is type 1 but type
2 or 3 was the one that was on the
listing when I clicked it I see you wish
to be fair like three dollars is still
an affordable price but that was
clickbait that was clickbait wish so I
guess I have to get type 1 let's add
that to the bag and move on to the next
item all right so the next thing that's
free is literally like only a few items
later these are called summer shorts
women's sports shorts gym workout
waistband skinny short they literally
put the word shorts in there three
separate times
it's a literally like me with YouTube
tags I'll be like period swimsuit
swimsuit period menstruation period okay
I mean these look like pretty harmless
shorts though they look like the type of
shorts that could come and be like child
sized accidentally so it's got four
stars on 3,000 reviews that's pretty
good people say love these small sizes I
suggest going a size up alright so that
sounds like a pretty good advice so
let's get a large and I'm gonna get them
in gray just to be exciting oh my
goodness
the gray larges are three dollars
suddenly as soon as you specify which
item you want they hike up the price
let's see if any of them are gonna be
actually free I could get an extra large
in black for free let me see if there
are any other colors no okay I guess I'm
getting an extra large black this might
be the marketing campaign they're gonna
hook you with free and then it's gonna
be like oh but it's free 99 so let's
take a look at the next free item here
we go this is a t-shirt it's called the
retro fashion women sexy off shoulder
short sleeve casual top t-shirt blouse
take a little breather after that one it
looks a little bit like they've ripped
these promotional photos from someone's
Instagram or Pinterest like it like just
slightly looks like they just Photoshop
the different colors on I'm gonna be
honest the ratings on these free things
have been pretty good like it says 4
stars out of 5 with 1700 reviews 17
thousand reviews excuse me
Wow maybe I've been miss reading all of
them let's see which one of these is
free so I'm gonna go for a large just to
have like the off-the-shoulder effect I
think I like the white one the best ahh
the large in white is four dollars okay
let me check the other colors nope none
of the largest are gonna be good just I
wish it would just tell me which ones
were actually free so I didn't have to
just click through them all not even the
medium orange who's buying a medium
orange like literally only the white one
and small is free okay I hope this fits
alright let's add that to bag I'm all
nervous that that one is not gonna be
able to fit over my head but let's keep
looking okay so the next free thing is
this like gold watch bracelet collection
oh and wow they have different colors
too
I'm gonna be honest I don't love this
thing but we're gonna get it
there are 77,000 reviews is it possible
that none of these are fake I mean maybe
people really like this so let's pick a
color maybe the white one I like oh that
one is free actually it looks like all
of these things are free okay awesome I
didn't like you to begin with but I
appreciate your honesty okay so we just
have one more free thing to go alright
oh demon pants for anyone out of the
loop I got those pants last time and
they are not sweatpants they are made
out of basically paper all right here is
our next and final free item it has a
blue checkmark next to it is it Twitter
verified I don't understand ah okay so
actually it is verified they say it's
verified by wish the product has been
inspected for the best quality which
means that none of the other things that
I bought have been inspected for the
best quality I mean it's a cute phone
case
Oh oh it looks like it could be hollow
alright so I'm gonna get the silver and
hallelujah it is still free so let's get
it okay so I have five free things that
honestly didn't take me that long to
find them so let's take a look at the
shopping cart and see what the shipping
adds up to interesting somehow I still
have an item total of five dollars even
though all the stuff was supposed to be
free so it looks like some of this stuff
when added to the cart even though it
said it was free when I clicked it is
not free Oh wish wish wish wish so it
looks like our off-the-shoulder t-shirt
is two dollars suddenly the shorts are
two dollars and the bra is one dollar I
don't know if they're hoping that I
wouldn't notice or what but I've noticed
I feel like I've been burned a little
bit I was promised a free thing and I
even for went the style and size that I
liked better to make sure I was getting
the free listing still not free so this
is usually when I would ditch these
items but for the sake of this
experiment let's get them and see what
they are
especially since wish seems to be trying
to get rid of them so badly all of the
estimated arrival dates are well over a
month away so I'll see you in a month
and a half with my haul okay so it's a
few weeks later and I finally have all
of my free things from wish to free
things and three deceitful things but I
think it seems like everything is here
in one piece so let's go through the
stuff that was actually free first and
then we'll go through the offender
second let's start with this little
watch first oh wow it's very long and
serpentine basically what it looked like
when I bought it was like a little
wristwatch with like a few banded cords
around it almost like bracelets and a
watch okay I'm gonna try and wrap this
thing I didn't expect to have to do so
much wrapping because in the photo it
looked just like one nice you know six
strand wash I would say that like this
watch is doing a lot like there's just a
lot of different hardware print rope
braiding it doesn't look quite as neat
or neatly wrapped as the
one in the photo did I may just be bad
at this or maybe they got like a
professional rap artist a rapper a
rapper a professional rapper perhaps I
don't know why the chains are so loose
my chains are hanging low but the second
hand is moving so it seems to be working
I feel like one of the dynamics of wish
is like when you order it like what the
heck is gonna arrive and I think that
this is not not what it said that it was
so the second and final actually free
thing is this iPhone case this was
interesting because it was the only
thing that was wish verified in fact the
only thing I've ever bought from wish
that was wish verified on the back it
says I get a jelly case a screen
protector and a waterproof bag which I
didn't know I was getting so that seems
exciting ooh oh my god do you see that
spot I've got a little rouse there um
I'm a little confused
is this the waterproof bag that they're
speaking of like I'm just supposed to
carry my phone around in this bag and is
this the screen protector like I'm just
supposed to like put this on top of my
screen like protected okay so let's get
my phone naked and uh put some new
clothes on it I've had this phone case
for a while now is there coffee in there
why is there liquid inside my phone case
right now I think my phone was just
sweating no God that doesn't smell good
that smells kind of bad actually I don't
know what that is
just put this on oh it isn't kind of a
soft jelly case Oh fancy I can tell that
the phone case doesn't have like an
extra lift like extend to past your
screen though so if you drop the do it
just like be done for I mean for being
like a free phone case I think this is
actually like pretty cute and like it is
what I thought it would be I wouldn't
buy a free phone case thinking that I
would be like getting the best
protection ever so as long as you're
like aware that you're probably not
getting much besides some nice Sparkle I
think this is okay these are way to like
actually free things from wish so that
brings me to the things that were not
free which are right here let's start
off with this thing because I've opened
it already
um this is the bralette I have bought a
bralette from wish
time which I actually liked and this one
seems okay
like there's no sort of like shaped like
it's very just like a straight bar of
lace across the boobs
I feel like this bra is actually the
worst offender because they lured my
click with a different style then that
style umbrella was not free and this one
was listed as free so I got this one
instead and then this one wasn't even
free alright so I'm gonna put this on
and see how it is cuz I feel like right
now I kind of have like an emotional
vendetta against it but it might be fine
I don't know okay this is it it's not
bad it actually looks pretty cute
underneath this thing the only things
that like the lace on top it's kind of
like folding down under into my armpit
boob but I like the back I think the
back is pretty cool I will say that like
this product being free was its main
appeal to me so I still haven't like
really let that go but the bra overall
is fine it's not the bando that I wanted
but it's the bando that I got okay so
let's open this shirt next so this is a
love shirt
I think as you can see it's almost like
a boatneck cut like kind of off the
shoulder I mean this shirt looks like I
will be able to put it on me like it
looks like it's gonna fit but I don't
think that's gonna fit like the picture
because I had to get a small so let's
put it on Here I am here's my shoulder I
feel terrified that I am not actually
pushing this in this direction it's
actually cut this way it makes me feel
really unsettled to be honest why do you
feel inside I just feel like it's not
resolved like I just want to just like
fix it for yours make weight and then it
can't as a free thing I was okay with
the idea of it because I thought like I
liked kind of like the bigger shirt that
I got from Mitch last night I was kind
of off the shoulder but this is just too
small for it to really get that good
effect and that's why I think it's like
a little bit like unnerving but it's not
a bad shirt I just wish I had one to two
sizes larger in it so the last item is
this pair of shorts I think there was
the same issue with these shorts as
there was with this shirt or like there
was only really like one size and color
combination that was free or so it said
before I put it in the cart of course
they look kind of like 70s men's
basketball shorts or like kind of like
the shorts that like Michael Cera was
wearing in judo and he was like jogging
around and like getting kids pregnant
alright let's put these on here are my
michael cera shorts these ones actually
are pretty comfortable and they seem to
fit me pretty well so I feel like I
could use these shorts you know if I
remind me of like people still wear
soapy shorts you know kind of the old
slow SEC plain cotton shorts I mean they
weren't free which is why I have some
relief with them but in general they're
like actually pretty good shorts like I
think that they actually fit pretty well
so I'm pretty comfortable ok so that was
my haul of free stuff from wish in
general I think that this stuff was
pretty on par quality wise with the
stuff that I've gotten from wish before
so I don't think this stuff is free
because it's worse my biggest issue with
the free stuff on wish is that some of
its not actually free now I know that
the prices on wish do change for each
item pretty quickly so it's possible
that like maybe it was free to start and
then 10 minutes later it was already
changed to a dollar or two dollars but
the other possibility is that they're
just trying to rip people off for a
small amount of money and like not doing
a very good job at it they could have
hid that cost somewhere else like in
shipping or tax and I probably wouldn't
have noticed I just I look at my cart
before I check out and that was my
problem so if they're trying to like
promote their brand and their website
with this whole free thing they're not
doing a great job at it like I kind of
like them a little less because of it
but doesn't mean I won't ever buy
anything from wish again but I feel like
I'm gonna probably leave the free stuff
