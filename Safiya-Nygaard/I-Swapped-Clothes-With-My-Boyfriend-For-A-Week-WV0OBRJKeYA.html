video this week I'm gonna be dressing
out of my boyfriend's closet you may not
recognize him with his facial hair but
this is Tyler this is I am the same
person I like it
yeah I look like a knuckle so I've done
a decent amount of style challenges
before like wearing things for a week
but I've never tested out men's clothing
let alone
Tyler's clothing a lot of a lot of good
clothing in there very stylish
GQ I've read it actually I don't know I
have read it now Tyler and I have pretty
different styles
I feel like Tyler has a pretty sporty
look
you know t-shirts jeans a lot of gym
shorts yeah right there right but I
dunno he also has a lot of quarter zips
and polos in there the vestiges from
crappier days yes so this week I'm gonna
try and wear some outfits that you
normally wear and then also some outfits
that might actually work for me maybe to
you know show you some of the
possibilities of things that you could
wear because Tyler's very economical
with his clothing thank you he wears the
same thing for days on end as it should
be worn and I know that he definitely
has enough clothing to wear a different
outfit every day of the week I like
wearing the same thing you know I like
until it like starts to turn colors a
little bit he doesn't smell as bad as
you would think
alright I guess we're starting now so
I'm gonna go raid my boyfriend's closet
let's do it so for my first outfit I had
to go with some gym shorts most entire
stream shorts are red but you know these
are the ones that are clean so I picked
these now for this outfit I picked his
blue quarter zip long-sleeve top these
navy blue and white gym shorts
and these black running shoes and some
snazzy socks like this is classic Tyler
just wearing gym shorts anywhere at all
times most of the days I went with like
a blue theme did you get that out of my
lodger basket well I hung it up to me
like it was coming out of the closet but
yes I did get this out of the laundry
basket you know a lot of clean clothes
no now right now I don't think I stood
out in any way I feel like I just looked
like I was maybe going to the gym later
never skip leg day or in my case never
even have a leg day I was very
comfortable and that is something that
Tyler often cites that he likes to be
comfortable so I get it
I almost feel like I'm just like wearing
pajamas that's how I feel all the time
these shorts actually fit me pretty well
it turns out that they are 17 years old
Tyler notified me that these shorts are
from his fourth grade little league team
little league basketball little league
basketball excuse me I'm impressed that
they lasted this long and I'm impressed
that Tyler still fits into them now I
know Tyler as a child you've literally
walked a mile in his shorts not quite a
mile a few yards for sure this is
definitely pretty different from my
usual style but I think it represents
Tyler style pretty well and for the
first day of this week it was pretty
easy and breezy I do look a little bit
like Tyler but with shorter leg hair or
I guess I wonder how much leg hair he
had in fourth grade now sorry sproutin
for my day to outfit I went with this
kind of rugged LA lumberjack look it's a
weird because like I'm not used to not
having a bag so I do feel like a little
bit incomplete but you know the pocket
is fun and my hands are very warm so in
this outfit I wore this short-sleeved
plaid shirt this white undershirt with a
little pocket these grey skinny pants
which actually fit me pretty well these
timberland boots and my favorites
Tyler flip up sunglasses I've been
trying to steal these glasses from Tyler
for a while the motives of the video
coming out my favorite Tyler going out
look is a top of his choice skinny jeans
or skinny pants and these timberland
boots I'm a big fan of Tyler in these
timberland boots and he rarely wears
them wink-wink nudge-nudge so I was just
you know trying to bring them back out
to just show him that they're still here
you guys something that Tyler has never
done how long have you had these shoes
Tyler since before I knew you for years
look what's still on it
Tagg no don't take it off leave it on
okay fine fine I'll leave it on it's
cooler that way I layered the tops which
is not something that Tyler usually does
but I feel like Tyler would either wear
a button-down or just like a plain
t-shirt with this is it a little James
Dean yeah it's gonna say James Dean
you're like a beatnik a greaser I tied
the shirt up to kind of give it a little
bit more like shape and I think that
made it feel a little bit more like my
style rather than just something out of
Tyler's closet I'm not sure that I would
wear this again but I would really like
it if Tyler wore this again also Tyler
please take the tag off of these so on
day three I went for this Star Wars
themed sweatshirt look I'm bringing out
Tyler's Darth Vader sweatshirt yeah I
actually bought him for Christmas two
years ago it's a very nice sweater it's
kind of like uh I don't know I wouldn't
call this but it's also got a rug I also
went for these dark wash jeans and these
black lace-up shoes whose laces are
dying I don't know what you did to these
shoe laces I could bare like beyond just
like worn down there like looks like
someone eat their mangled Tyler does
wear this sweatshirt very often during
the wintertime so I feel like this
outfit is actually like a pretty put
together date night outfit for Tyler
like he's taken stuff out in the fall or
winter tall day with you yeah it's not
like a like a first date outfit if you
like it how about when you wear it now
at a first date I ended up choosing
these jeans because Tyler's other jeans
that I wanted to wear were ripped pretty
violently I took these pants out of the
laundry hamper as I've quickly realized
we should have probably done more
laundry before starting this week in
fact I think every item in this outfit
is somehow unwashed because we're kind
of scared of laundering this sweatshirt
Tyler's worn this a fair few times and I
don't believe we've ever washed it
because we've been so nervous about
ruining the design it's got like a
carpet you need a vacuum I would wear
this again I feel like we need to figure
out how to wash this thing though now
that we've been exposed now that we've
exposed ourselves
don't spill and Darth know so on day
four I went for some of Tyler's remnants
from his prep your days so the only D
it's missing though is a popped collar
are you willing to go that far
oh yeah yeah that's distinctly worse so
for this outfit I went with this blue
short sleeves polo shirt
these dark wash jeans this belt and
these brown lacy loafers either you're
wearing more belts in one week than I've
ever worn I put all of your belts in
like one specific part of your closet
and for some reason you've never been
able to find them but I know exactly
where they are they even lost me now I
definitely don't see Tyler wearing this
outfit all the time but it was revealed
to me that Tyler used to wear this
outfit specifically at his old job other
than that I feel like you'd probably
find this outfit digging through Tyler's
old Facebook photos not to be unfair I
did also own a few polos in the mid
2000s and I did wear them but I don't
still have they were in this outfit kind
of gave me like a 50s vibe for some
reason like almost like I could be like
at a soda shop II I think that what
added to that vibe was also these shoes
which were a little big for me so they
kind of made my feet look like votes but
they were the right vibe for that kind
of 50s look as well as the socks coming
out of them I physically gave you a
little cap you could definitely be
delivering paper I don't think I would
wear this outfit again but I did kind of
enjoy the rosie the riveter retro vibes
so I feel like maybe I would consider a
pair of cropped high-waisted pants and a
tucked in shirt you also feel you be a
kid like that goes into Willy Wonka's
chocolate factory and never comes asking
no-name extra so on day five I went for
a Tyler in Vegas look I used to call
this outfit the Tommy Timberlake half
Tom Haverford half Justin Timberlake
ha oh you want good things
so in this outfit I chose a stripy
button-down shirt
this also stripy dark vest a skinny tie
these gray skinny pants from earlier
this week and these brown lace-up shoes
this is like an outfit I would have worn
standing in a line at a club what's your
move time oh this this is my move
no I feel like usually you're like
that's how I dance you're gonna do me
like that you're gonna throw me under
the bus
Tyler doesn't wear this type of style
very often but he does sometimes when
he's prodded I mean I could wear this a
like-new years now right it's like you
don't know last New Year's we just
watched Lord right no so I wore gym
shorts Happy New Year from me and Frodo
and Merry and Pippin the whole crew this
was very different from my usual style
feel a little like Charlie Chaplin
almost like um I should have like a
bowler hat
it lands on my head and I feel like this
represents the peak of Tyler's outfit
planning I will say this is quite like
styled for you this is the most style
that I've ever vet I had a vision for
this outfit because I'm gonna make that
outfit exactly this did bring back some
memories of a 2008 vest that I wore your
best days I had best days we don't talk
about that but if there was a reason to
wear it again I would so for my sixth
outfit I went with Tyler's look from the
1987 video also known as the villain
from The Karate Kid oh you're pulling
off the muscle - you look ready to like
go out and dance and stuff if only I
were like a better hip-hop dancer yeah
if only you were a hip-hop dancer
they're not better if only I knew how to
dance at all so in this outfit I've got
a blue muscle t-shirt these acid-washed
jeans a belt a blue hoodie and these
yellow converse this outfit did in fact
make me feel like a late 80s early 90s
tomboy I call this outfit Mario Lopez
and Saved by the Bell
AC Slater I don't quite have the guns
but I've got the arm here the
interesting thing about this acid-washed
look is that it was meant to be kind of
an trojan as' like there were a lot of
like couples matching in them and so I
felt a lot like I did when I wore my
other counterpart to this outfit in fact
like both of the outfits were wearing
today are pretty unisex
yeah we just swapped in there and I feel
like overall the outfit was fun and kind
of made me feel mischievous and
sprightly I was a hopping around jumping
on things was parkour even around the
eighties I invented it I would
definitely wear this again actually over
it makes me feel kind of like a little
boy those are like construction pants
aren't they no they're dad jeans from
Costco nah I feel like in a slightly
more modern day I would have had like a
skateboard had been like really annoying
you better buy that because we're buying
this half so for my last outfit I went a
bit rogue I pulled together things from
different parts of Tyler's closet to
make an outfit that he definitely has
never worn before but was more my style
I'm getting strong like Monica and
Phoebe catering vibes from you right now
so in this outfit I chose one of Tyler's
white button-downs a blue fish belt
these black flared pants from the 1977
video and these brown pointy loafer
shoes this is the only belt that Tyler
has that didn't have any holes in it so
I could make it as small as I wanted to
so we went with the fish I used to wear
that belt all the time so it's got a few
battle wounds on it how old do you think
it is
eighth grade it's one of my only belts
though so I still I do whip it out
everyone how many belts and they're all
the same spot dammit they're hard to
find
I also like the shape of these pants
because they do kind of like hug my
thighs and then flare out at the bottom
you can keep those pants I don't know
what I'm gonna wear them Merry Christmas
thank you it's hard to say exactly what
vibe this gave me I feel a little bit
like Antonio Banderas like teaching
people how to salsa only the new Dancy
partner this is Catherine zeta-jones oh
yeah I really enjoyed wearing this
outfit nine and a half out of ten would
wear again and I'm glad that the John
Travolta pants got another day out in
the Sun I'm gonna start wearing them so
back off buster
so that was my week of wearing outfits
from Tyler's closet overall I'd say it
was both easier and harder than I
thought it would be the easy part was
that there were no like new items of
clothing that I had no idea what to do
with but it was also kind of hard
because our closets are so different
yeah not just our senses of style but
like our building blocks of outfits are
very different like I have like dresses
and skirts and shirts and sweaters and
crop tops and you mostly have tops and
pants and a few gym shorts so it's kind
of at some points like what can I do
tomorrow that would be different from
today you want to mix it up and you want
to use my closet it's probably not a
match made in heaven
I also learned some new things about
your clothes that I'm not sure I wanted
to know like how long you've had certain
items I thought that we developed some
layer of endearment for you you're like
this guy is sustainable I would say
overall my favorite outfits this week
that I think I would wear again were
outfits 2 6 &amp;amp; 7 I really loved the
timberlands outfit but I feel like I was
mostly wearing them to remind you that
they were in your closet so you could
wear them more yeah I felt I felt like
the the push of encouragement very often
you're like you have white shirts that
have buttons on them too but besides
that I was pretty comfortable this week
everything was about the right size or
like maybe slightly too big yeah and I
did find a couple of things that I want
to snatch so if they're missing they
might be in my closet thank you guys so
