video this month I'm gonna be swapping
my current skincare routine for a
10-step korean one in america over the
last couple of years there's been a lot
of hype around Korean skincare I've
heard a lot about the benefits of it
like hydration anti aging I see the
words brightening and plumping a lot but
for me there's always been a little bit
of an intimidation factor in trying it
out mostly because of the amount of
steps and different types of products
there are so I bought this beginner's
intro to Korean skin care kit from this
website called SoCo glam which includes
ten products and no instructions but
after a little googling I think I at
least know roughly what order of the
steps are supposed to go in it seems
like I'm gonna be doing a lot of
cleansing washing scrubbing toning
essences
whatever essence is moisturizing and
moisturizing again I am Sisyphus the
sink is my rock this is a big step up
for my current skincare routine which
consists of like three steps cleansing
scrubbing and moisturizing but I'm
excited to try out this routine for a
month and see if there are any
noticeable benefits okay let's dive
right in alright let's finally clean
this face right let's get into it
I feed actually in the evening time we
have nine steps and then in the daytime
we have ten steps because one of the
steps is a SPF but we've got nine steps
for the night so let's see how long that
takes I mean this is not one of them
this is Tyler Tara mousse so we're
looking for that actually so basically
at least start with a makeup remover or
oil based cleanser it's called clean at
zero like vanilla co like vanilla but
vanilla so basically I guess you use
your old spatula you've got
about water hands by being my food you
do what your makeup on you don't have to
take your makeup off first
this is it's supposed to take your
makeup off it's like a what are there
any instructions in each one of these
boxes I hope so
use the spatula and take a reasonable
amount of the balm
oh it feels like coconut oil gently
massage the formula and circular motions
on to dry skin to dissolve makeup when I
look at my hands I've got these pellets
I'm like foundation colored something
something I want to wash my face so bad
you know I get I like that it's taking
the makeup off it seems but I don't like
how it feels on the page one step down
eight to go
oh there's gold oil of the eyes but I
think my makeups gone it's completely
going next is our water-based cleansers
you cleanse oil tons of water and you
moisturizer moisturizer this is called
the real fresh foam green tea cleanser
Punk one to two puffs and gently massage
all over what face oh this smells so
nice it smells like whatever tea leaves
are at the bottom
I don't like matcha to drink but on the
face I could accept it alright padding
dry so the next step is exfoliator so
we've got this thing they've given us
this is the strawberry food therapy
scrub mask oh it smells like
strawberries won't want to eat that
crust you want some too Chris do you
want some no no basically I just massage
this into my skin oh it's warm
both for me well that's warming on the
face I don't know if this is what it's
supposed to do it feels like a little
like acidic almost yeah like as if it's
kind of like attacking chemically the
top layers of my skin all right it's
been a couple of minutes let's take this
off oh my skin is so soft there we go
step three down step four is toner there
called the organic cotton treatment
toning pads by drip
they smell like ginger right after
cleansing use one sheet of pad applied
to sweep across t-zone and
on you zone use it must be this right
don't feel any different but you guys
smell a little bit more like Sookie
next is the essence here this there's so
many products there's so many things
here the look is up like everytime this
is the galacto my C's 95 whitening power
essence it's basically like a second
toner I think I think it just like
thumbs like a pre moisturizer I don't
know it does something that for your
skin basically it says on cheeks spread
a generous amount to skin and then tap
the under-eye area as if playing the
piano
boom boom alright I think I played the
piano quite well oh I missed the mask
part what I think I'm supposed to do the
math before the s and the step so I did
it out of order for this one going
forward I'll swap those back to where
they're supposed to be but just for
today I'm just gonna put the mask on now
this is the mana fit - bling bling
hydrogel mask and I think like most
masks you just put it on for like 15 to
20 minutes the interesting thing is this
is one of the steps but they only gave
me one sheet mask so I guess I'm just
supposed to provide my own sheet masks
here's my top half
oh it's sparkly oh it smells like
play-doh
alright so it's on my face I'm going to
leave it on for like 15 minutes and then
we're going to try and finish this
skincare routine sometime tonight this
is one day all right let's take this bad
boy off oh god I feel like I'm just
amazing so much like my skin just gonna
dry out so so far we've done cleansing
cleansing scrubbing toning masking and
essence so now we're gonna do motions
then eye cream eye cream and then night
moisturizer I'm a little overwhelmed but
I think my face is gonna like it
this is called the snail be high-content
Ellucian so that's kinda like corn it
feels really nice though this is like my
third moisturizing step in a row and I
have two moisturizing steps left alright
so that was lotion next up is eye cream
so this is the moisture barrier eye
cream by good old ready mmm that was way
too much for the eyes I'm learning as we
go how much we need oh wow oh it's a
nice rich cream pathetic so that is eye
cream all right so the last step for the
evening is this night Repair Cream is
this not a cream oh that's hardcore I
think that actually maybe it's an
essence so we're supposed to put it on
at the same time as this I guess let's
move to essences I'm gonna put this on
now but when I do this next time I'm
gonna do it at the same time that I put
this essence on alright so I'm gonna
take a little bit and we're just gonna
put it on top of everything that's
happened it smells going like honey ish
it feels really smooth but at this point
I feel like I could just be feeling the
layers of moisturizer that's already on
my skin so with that I think I've used
all my steps
the only other step that is in the
routine is this thing which is a SPF to
put on during the daytime so we'll start
wearing out tomorrow I think that in
general I feel really moisturized I
think I feel like treated like I'm like
I treated my skin I'm just gonna be a
plump peach at the end of this but
besides that the time is lengthy maybe
I'll get a little bit faster in general
just from getting the routine down this
morning I felt moisturized and that I
the moisture off and then put it all
back on so I'm continuing to feel
moisturized the theme of week one was
pretty much just that my skin was
drowning in lotion an interesting side
effect is because I was using my hands
to apply so much of the moisturizer my
hands especially my fingertips are
incredibly soft right now you're welcome
to anyone's hand that I shake during
this month the hydration also turned
basically into fertilizer for my
mustache
it's really been growing in like nice
hydrated smooth long cuz like it's so
moist as a greenhouse for your mustache
it's it's a little bit like a rainforest
it's like you know you just keep it
moist and I'll start growing one early
problem I ran into was the sheep mask
situation as I mentioned before SoCo
Glam only gave me one sheet mask in the
kit so instead of going out and like
buying a ton of sheet masks I figured
why not have Eve my mask printing
machine print me one every night I want
you to be able to take her sweet time
and like do what she needs to do but
there's no way I can do this every night
and it's okay I'm super great yes - but
even without Eve doing a sheet mask
every day would be just too much time in
general so the ten steps turned into
nine steps pretty quickly I think I
generally look like more hydrated and
more dewy I may look a little tired this
morning because I didn't sleep that much
last night but in general I think my
skin is like finally accepting the
moisture by week two I had gotten a lot
faster at doing the routine and I feel
like my skin was looking like pretty
plump and young Tyler noticed this and
decided to try some of the products for
himself oh yeah at least let it sit on
your face for a second it's like it's
like Jam put smokers in my face I do not
recommend putting Smuckers on your face
I do I can't you know oh do you taste
good it's bitter
it's much more bitter than you assumed
it looks delicious
that was gonna be the hardest part about
it was not eating it I don't want
anymore
oh-ha season they're very physical man
it's only one watch but I like that you
actually look great to be honest really
you better know what is a difference
yeah you look better than me besides
Tyler using and also eating some of the
exfoliant week 2 also brought about
another hurdle something that's
happening right now is that we're
heading out of town for the weekend and
I'm trying to figure out how to pack my
Korean skincare routine it's not
necessarily going well it is very
difficult to travel with I was only able
to bring seven of my ten steps with me I
also have checked my suitcase to get
everything here because there was just
too much fluid in every bottle they
weren't quite travel friendly I also got
my period that week so between not
having all my products riding the
Crimson wave traveling and Chicago just
being pretty darn humid I started seeing
some pimples I started breaking out a
little bit just like this like one in
the brow there's like one over here
whatever there I feel like currently I'm
just equipped with like a thousand
moisturizers and I want to be able to
like put on like a little spa treatment
I don't have one because that's not
really part of the regime I'm just gonna
keep moisturizing it and hope that it
eventually goes away once my period goes
away by week three the pimples were
still there so I tried my current go-to
spot treatment which is tea tree oil but
there are just so many other products in
this routine I felt like it was rendered
mostly useless so the pimples ruled the
day I got a good one going here then I
also got a good one going up here and a
smaller one going there and a couple
more going over there I feel like the
philosophy on skincare changed a lot
like in the 2000s it was like oh you
look girly skin you should dry your face
out and wash it and now it's like oh
yeah oily skin you should cleanse with
oil what should I be doing I don't know
- visits by week four I felt like I had
a pretty well-oiled machine literally
and figuratively so this is me doing my
whole routine in order I think I finally
figured it out after a weeks
so we've got oil cleansing cleansing
scrubbing toning essences I creaming
moisturizing an SPF 8 and that's it
pretty simple huh there is also my
nighttime serum slosh essence but I only
use that at night so I guess it's only
like eight steps morning at night eight
steps twice a day sixteen steps a day um
16 times 3 is 48 so 400 like 96 times I
did 496 applications of something to my
face this month I hope that math is
right I think it is overall I enjoyed my
month doing a Korean skincare routine I
don't think that my skin looks like
completely different like I don't think
that my face just looks like baby's
buttocks but I do think that my skin is
probably more hydrated than it's ever
been before I definitely think I'm gonna
use all of these products until they're
finished like I did like them all a
decent amount and I actually think that
after using everything for months I do
have a decent amount of everything left
definitely my favorite steps where the
oil based cleanser and the eye cream the
oil based cleanser is like witchcraft
this thing actually really does take off
all of your makeup the other product I
really liked was this eye cream very
nice
smells good very moisturizing I
shouldn't sneak you something I came up
until the forehead is mom I don't think
it's like magnitudes better than any
other eye cream I've ever tried but the
smell like encouraged me to keep using
it it was good for morale so in some
regards like using this kind of like
starter pack of like 10 steps was a good
way to like get introduced to the Korean
skincare without having to do a lot of
decision-making or ordering myself I
think you could definitely like
substitute other products in for these
products it's more about just like doing
all the steps and like really like
putting the work in and the time the
energy and the rubbing I do think that
I'm gonna incorporate at least more
steps into my normal routine maybe not
10 or 9 or 8 but you know maybe like 5
or 6 I am going to look into a spot
treatment though because the pimples
come and go but they're definitely a
