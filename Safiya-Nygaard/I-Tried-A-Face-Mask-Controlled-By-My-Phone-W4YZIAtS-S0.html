video today I'm gonna be trying out a
face mask controlled by my iPhone yes
that sounds weird and I think it's going
to be weird I'm very excited about this
product mostly because it's a little
contraband this face mask is called play
skin it's made by an Italian company
called the bald on group and it's only
sold in the UK in Italy so I had one of
my lovely uk-based subscribers smuggle
it to me and they ordered it on my
behalf and now it's here this face mask
supposedly sends electric micro currents
from your phone to your face to
revitalise plump and generally shocked I
think so my questions are does it work
does it hurt will I be electrocuted in
any way and also will I be able to play
my skin like a game boy okay let's get
into it so I like my box of masks here
on the front it says there's an average
increase in hydration of a hundred and
fifteen percent in one session tests
carried out on 20 subjects at the
cosmetology center of the University of
Ferrara so at least 20 other people have
tried this before and ostensibly have
survived it so I guess I'll be number 21
let's open this up and see what's inside
okay so it looks like we've got some
directions this looks like a pair like
airplane headphones but I think that
this is the connector from the face mask
to your phone and then it looks like
we've got some electrodes it kind of
looks like you know a little heart
monitors but I guess you're gonna put
that onto the face they look like things
you put on an 11 from stranger things
and then we've got some machetes or
masks I'm sorry about my Italian accent
I feel like my Italian accent goes
straight to Spanish and my French accent
goes straight to Italian and then I also
have this play skin anti-aging renewal
cream so that looks like something I've
seen before are you here selling an
electric conductor let's hope not
alright so the first step is to download
the play skin app from the App Store
which I already have
and then the second step is to tie up
your hair and cleanse your face all
right so I'm gonna go take my makeup off
and I'll be right back for some shocking
good times okay so this is my before
I've got a couple of pimps down here a
couple things I've been picking at and I
also tweezed some mustache hairs for you
guys so you're welcome so we are on step
number three which is open the mask and
take the two mask components out of the
package oh they're very dry usually when
I open up a sheet mask I'm used to it
being like super wet like dripping okay
so step number four is put the two
components on a flat surface film facing
upwards what's that guy from spirited
away moaning yeah looks a little bit
like no named okay so step five is
remove the protections from both strips
something about the word protections
seems high stakes to me so hopefully
this is not the part where I get
electrocuted step six is adhere the
electrodes to the strips after removing
them from their base is that really the
word they're using electrode yeah we're
going with electrode attach this to a
toaster and drop it into a bathtub here
are my electrodes that will spermies
position the electrodes while keeping
the cables up I think that's right
because both the electro I'm stuck to it
because both the electrodes are facing
up up facing up okay so step number
seven is remove and position the
double-sided adhesive discs and adhere
them to the electrodes and then remove
the protective films from the mask all
right I think that we're we're ready
shall we
oh yeah it's a sticky one oh oh it's
pretty cooling it feels cool Tyler
what's that it's sticking on my
sideburns it's in there isn't it yeah
you might be in for an involuntary
waxing oh my god actually that really
hurts I think you just please get it on
there and then we'll just pull the
band-aid off I literally and
figuratively later I didn't realize I
had significantly more sideburns than 20
Italian college students I'm not
surprised
okay let's do the bottom part now my
sideburns are really involved oh they're
in the line of fire okay well that was
unfortunate what's next okay so step 11
is connect
electrodes to the cable supplied and
position the right side and left wires
over your ears tie I think I might need
some of your help no I put on my face
mask so askew it's not the best
placement but it's on you see like I
thought these like little places to plug
me in yeah so plug me in was like
nineties electronics right here that is
blowing it first
oh no please don't oh I'm with horny
sideburns yeah my bad okay
I plugged in yes and then 12 is connect
the connector to your smartphone where's
my cable attached to your head there we
go
it's like the longest rat tail I know
you know what it is it's like one of
those avatar ponytails oh it actually is
because I'm plugging myself into my one
true mate
okay so I'm plugged into the matrix so
let's open up my computer and we'll
start screen recording and seeing them
what happens when I turn this mask on so
I'm opening up the play skin app it says
hello are you ready for your beauty
treatment I'm pretty much as ready as
I'll ever be
step 13 is use the mirror function to
check whether the mask has been applied
correctly it's not great but I don't
really know what to do to fix it the
problem is I can't readjust without
completely ripping off my sideburns so I
think we're just gonna go with it
so step 14 is start the treatment for
ten minutes of pure relaxation caution
the micro currents of your smartphone
have a very low intensity they are not
invasive or perceivable I like how they
say caution even before like good or
like not dangerous things
they're both reassuring and also
threatening they protect and they attack
okay so I'm gonna press play and we're
gonna start the electric microcurrents
oh no suddenly the active micro currents
are happening you put on your face uh I
feel like almost like a little bit of
like buzzing around my mustache area it
feels almost like I'm bleaching my
mustache but at the same time it could
just people see though okay so I think
we can rule out being electrocuted which
was a bit of a stretch to begin with
but I still wouldn't recommend taking
this in the bathtub something that's a
little different than I expected was
that they're kind of just going like the
micro currents are just like happening I
kind of thought I might be able to like
control them a little bit more you know
almost like shock myself or let me like
play a little game or something but it
does look like I've got some shopping
recommendations up here so let's see but
this is about
seductive glance impeccable look mascara
plumping complex cream okay so it looks
like it's maybe it's trying to sell me
their other products that they have I
love that they say this is ideal for
Nordic photo types maybe from my last
name they were like you should get this
blush you Nordic person you look like
the screamer as I've been thinking that
Picasso painting yeah anyway especially
we do that we've got a 20 second
countdown to the end of this thing wow
that was 10 minutes that went by so fast
cuz I'm not shopping to do oh wow seven
six oh it went directly from 7 seconds
to done okay so that was it I guess um
shall we take it off yes okay down there
it looks normal it does look red or
anything red oh no no I thought I'd
gotten it loose oh wow
actually that did hurt is that I like it
there okay all right so let me take this
side off now oh oh that one was better
alright so let's put on the cream which
is our last step
it feels pretty normal it tastes like
lemons you guys have eaten lotions yeah
that one doesn't taste good they're not
really all edible okay so this is me a
couple minutes after applying the cream
I think that it's absorbed pretty well
in I think in general I do look shinier
so I do look more hydrated in that sense
but because I put the cream on it's hard
for me to tell if the mask is what was
special and like the microcurrents
really did anything so just to have a
second opinion I'm gonna put the mask on
Tyler okay ty let's do it alright so I'm
really quick setting up Ty's mask
I don't think South because I could do
this on my own
well you started doing it on your own
and then you asked me for help almost
immediately yeah it's actually true oh
it is cool oh wow you look like a sexy
Santa ho ho oops sorry I got your
sideburn - that wasn't on purpose or
anything his revenge
alright so let's grab your little avatar
tail and uh plug it into my phone so I
guess we both now had avatar sex with my
phone you ready for your beauty
treatment yeah we show it to me again
we'll look at your face yeah you put it
really asked you to really
stupid-looking it's almost am i well
let's do it ready yes press play do you
feel anything I'm trying so hard to feel
if there's anything I think if there's
something it's not like an electrical
buzzing but it's more like a message to
cool down the mask you think it's
actually temperature controlled yeah
well I assure that it wasn't do anything
persevere
no I'm like sure it's doing something
for me I brought Krusty to see if he
also thought you look like sexy Santa
wait you know what this does feel like a
little spa treatment we're not relaxed I
know kitty
they have a cool on face mask I'm gonna
be as hydrated a watermelon after this
all right how much time do you have left
five minutes Jesus it's gonna take
forever
Krusty I'm very sorry I don't think we
should be giving you a mask all right
take it off here's the money shot right
here uh yeah okay so the last step is to
put a little cream on I think I look
more hydrated I don't 115% but
definitely uh more than 0% more hydrated
okay so Tyler seems to think that this
thing changes temperature on his face I
couldn't really feel anything I think
that what I was feeling was placebo so
I'm almost wondering if there's like no
microcurrent and it's just all the cream
so we're gonna head to Home Depot really
quickly to see if we can't find
something that can help us see if
there's any actual electricity going
through this thing okay so we're in the
car all the way to Home Depot right now
too
multimeter which will hopefully hook
onto the electrodes and tell us how much
or if there is any electricity running
through the mask
all right hydrated tie show me in the
fluorescent lights out and how nice and
hydrated you look I'm sparkly look you
hydrated thank you
alright so this is a digital multimeter
hopefully we should be able to see if
there's something being conducted all
right let's get it okay so we're back
from our quick excursion to Home Depot
we're not sure exactly what we're doing
we consulted our friend mark but I'm not
convinced that he knows what he's doing
either okay so I'm gonna turn it on I
think that 200m is like the lowest or
maybe more like 2m yeah it's good to it
so I'm gonna use these little detectors
and try and touch this mask and see if I
can't detect any microcurrents no maybe
here no okay I wonder what would happen
if I unplug this right now so I pulled
this one out halfway so I've got some
exposed metal basically so let's see if
I can now find the micro currents this
way I know we made little jump it did I
swear they went up to three oh yeah I
did
look oh my god that's working yeah there
it is yeah holy crap there's electricity
in here for sure it's very interesting
though because I can't detect any
electricity when I'm touching the actual
mask but they are putting electricity in
this thing so it's not just nonsense not
confirmed what that necessarily does but
maybe you could sense it a little bit I
sensed it after a quick google search
there seem to be a few legit looking
scientific papers that link the use of
electric fields to skin rejuvenation and
therapy for degenerative skin diseases
I'm not sure if that's exactly what's
happening here but there seems to be
some science behind it all right so that
was pretty exciting I am very excited
that we were able to actually detect
some electricity running through the
mask but I'm still not convinced that my
face is a hundred and fifteen percent
more hydrated and I also still wish that
there was more of a play element to the
place skin mask like I thought I might
be able to do more concentrated bursts
almost like tap on different things
on my phone and like you know sort of
send different types of electrical
currents to my face so there wasn't as
much control or fun in the actual app as
I thought there might be and I also wish
there was a little more sensation I'm
glad it didn't hurt but I would like a
little buzz just so you know it's
working I just I need it to be a little
more shocking not too shocking because
that seems scary it's like a little
