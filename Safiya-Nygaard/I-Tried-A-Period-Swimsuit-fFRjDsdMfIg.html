video today I'm going to be taking on
another strange period product and this
time it's a swimsuit so I've been
hearing about this period swimsuit for a
little while and some of you guys have
tweeted at me and commented requesting
that I try it out so I decided to get it
and see what it is from what I can tell
it seems to be a swimsuit with a
reinforced crotch like they built in pad
basically it's described as leak-proof
swimwear so it's not watertight but it's
supposed to keep it all in it's actually
from the same company that makes the
period leggings that I tried a couple of
months ago which I had mixed feelings
about because the crotch was just a
little bulkier than I'd hoped it would
be and the company was a little
wishy-washy on whether you were supposed
to wear as a leggings by themselves or
with another period product which kind
of defeats the purpose in my opinion but
nevertheless we have the swimsuit now
and we're going to try it out so they
had a few different styles but I settled
on the black one piece after my
experience with the leggings I'm really
hoping that it isn't quite as turkeyneck
ish in the crotch area just because with
the leggings at least you can kind of
wear a tunic top to disguise the crotch
but with a swimsuit when you're on the
beach it's just kind of like wham bam
thank you ma'am
so this is what the instructions refer
to as the gusset it's like the crotchal
region of the inside of the bathing suit
and it's actually a fleecy material it
looks pretty much the same as the one on
the period leggings so we'll see now I'm
a tampon user so usually when I have to
wear a bathing suit on my period I'll
just pop one of those bad boys up there
but maybe this could safeguard against
any leaking possibilities on that front
in general though I think the swimsuit
is mostly geared towards those who wear
pads or other external period products
where the options currently are like
wear nothing or wear a pad into the
water and hope it doesn't blow up like a
balloon so if this thing works it could
be a good alternative I'm going to try
and replicate that experience so I'm
just going to wear this swimsuit by
itself with no other period product now
I'm actually going to be traveling this
week so I'm going to take this
swimsuit with me and we're going to try
it out in some undetermined body of
water somewhere in the United States all
right let's do it okay so it is day four
of my period out of seven I am traveling
I'm in Sandusky Ohio because I'm a guest
star on the girls night in tour and I'm
going to be wearing my period swimsuit
today we are going to Cedar Point which
is I believe an amusement park but
there's also you know sort of a
waterfront opportunity like a beachfront
on Lake Erie
weirdly this worked out because I feel
like a great lake it's the perfect place
to wear your period swimsuit because I
was kind of terrified to wear it to the
beach in LA because like that is an
ocean and there are sharks there and I
also feel kind of weird about wearing it
into a pool like I know there's chlorine
in a pool
it still feels more of like a contained
environment versus a great link has no
sharks and also is very large okay let's
go try it on
so when I put it on at the hotel the
first thing I noticed was how soft it
was it's not necessarily like super cute
but it's like a pretty harmless like
one-piece black bathing suit don't
really have any complaints about how it
looks or feels on the body I actually
thought that the crotch version less
noticeable than the cross with the
period liking there is to like a
separate gusset panel which like I'm not
super jazzed about like I wish it was
just more built-in overall but it
doesn't look at that so I think that's a
pretty important factor we're heading
out to Cedar Point a little bit and
we'll see how this thing does in the
wild so after leaving the hotel I was
basically wearing it as underwear and I
will say that in motion the gusset is
pretty comfortable
doesn't like chase when I walk so
chuckles all right so we are at Cedar
Point so far I feel actually deeply dry
definitely a drop or two but you know in
general feeling pretty good so let's see
what happens we get the beach it took me
a little while to find the lake I have
been walking for a little bit I don't
think that you know where I'm going but
there's a lake somewhere around here I
know smell it
okay you guys I think I finally figured
it out I think I'm actually walking up
to the beach right now
got some nice water to walk into looks
like we've got some innocent beachgoers
who don't know what I'm doing all right
so at the beach I took my dress off that
was over the bathing suit and the
bathing suit like looks pretty normal
when it's dry did that without putting
my camera down okay so I'm just in my
swimsuit I'm feeling pretty good right
now I know that I have bled into the
swimsuit already I hope I don't see any
blood like floating to the top when I
walk into the water and I also hope that
my pad doesn't inflate like a diaper but
let's just walk it at first I wanted to
get in the water slightly away from
other people just because I wanted to
kind of like do my own thing but I kind
of got freaked out by a leaf that
brushed against my legs I am actually
such a scary cat I was like walking like
really comfortably in knee-deep water
and I felt so leaf on my foot and I was
like okay now I'm nervous to get taken
to the water where there's no one nearby
maybe I should get closer to other
people so I was finally ready to
submerge my gusset in the water so I'm
just going to sit down and we're going
to see what happens
whistles okay but summers alright okay
although Pattinson Reese emerge or I'm
now submerged up until my waist
basically so the pad is completely under
the water it's a little bit straighter
down here so I did not see any clouding
or leaking actively happening as I sat
in the water I will say the lake water
is not very clear but I didn't see any
blood flow to the top I also did not
notice the gusset inflate like a raft
it did get wet obviously but it didn't
really get any bigger that's said it
didn't get heavier it does not expand
exponentially like a sniper would but it
definitely looks like way down and soggy
when I stand up it's almost just like a
wet piece of sleet after about thirty
minutes in the water
I wasn't jazzed about how it looked but
I had to get out some time I will say
though that I don't think anyone on the
stage is really giving me a second
chance besides the fact I'm filming
myself so I don't think anyone's really
noticing the droopy crotch as much as of
course I am noticing it all myself
I found a public shower and rinsed off
before putting my dress back on yeah a
public shower yeah Kalash in my butt I
think actually a little bit of sand got
stuck in the gutter because I kind of I
was really swimming I was more sitting
so if anyone call me killer
we're trying to house so after that I
just wanted to see how long the swimsuit
would take to dry something I didn't
actually think about until just now is
that I am now period into a wet gusset I
hope it can still absorb while it's wet
I'm wearing a black dress also I bought
this clam hat in honor of my period
I am so the bottom of the swimsuit dried
pretty quickly but I waited a long time
for the crotch to dry all right I would
say it's about 40 minutes post beach and
I feel like everything is dry pretty
much except for the guts which still
feel Saudis the heart of the exact way
if there has been any like truth
yes it's like everything is wet I don't
think the swimsuit was leaking blood but
it was leaking water like I sat down on
a bench and then when I stood up like my
whole butt was just like covered in
water spot on there's water it looks
like just wet seven looks like I peed my
pants which is all so I was pretty much
out of commission for doing anything
else at the theme park it kind of put a
damper on my spirits okay so it's been
about three hours since I got in the
water the Sun is going down we're going
to head back to the hotel soon and I
would say that I still have not reached
like dr0 like I'm still a little bit
damp I don't know that it's ever going
to get there when it's on my body by the
time we left the crotch still wasn't
completely dry all right you guys I am
back in the hotel after I took it off it
took probably like an hour to like fully
fully dry but the funny thing is now
that it's dry I got to wash it again and
then wait for it to dry again and then
put it in my suitcase overall I would
say my experience in the period swimsuit
was not terrible but there were some
issues there's no question to me that
this is probably better than wearing a
pad straight into the water I've never
done that but this does eliminate the
inflation factor as well as the
visibility factor of like seeing the
wings of a pad on a swimsuit I will say
that this twin suit was pretty fine when
it was dry like I don't think that the
crotch was not bulky and I'll also say
that the absorbency when dry was pretty
impressive like I didn't even feel any
dampness before I got the water so after
the test of like putting my butt in the
water I would say that the swimsuit self
totally fine when I was just sort of
like stationary and there wasn't any
like visible leaking or expansion which
was great that's said once you get out
of the water it's not quite as seamless
it's a little bulky it's not horrible
not horrible but it's not ideal
it's definitely noticeable and also it
seems to take forever to dry once it's
wet see the problem is that that is wet
sleep oh yeah that's the issue is bulky
huh it's bulky but it's more than it's
just like not
suit material right I think that if you
are someone who really doesn't like
tampons or can use tampons this could be
a good solution just like to go to the
beach or something but in terms of
actually getting in the water I think
it's a little soggy looking when it's
dry and doesn't look too bad so if
you're not swimming it could be a great
solution but if you are swimming I don't
know I don't know thank you guys so much
