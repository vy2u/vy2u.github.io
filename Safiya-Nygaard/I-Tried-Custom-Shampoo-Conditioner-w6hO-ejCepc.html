this
hello and friends and welcome to another
video today I'm going to be ordering
customized shampoo for the hair that is
on my head but let's be real I've also
used shampoo for hair that is not on my
head and honestly I think it works
better than body wash so basically a
couple of months ago I started seeing
ads for this company called function of
beauty and they basically how do you
take like an online quiz and then from
that they determine your hair concerns
and then send you personalized shampoo
and conditioner currently my hair care
routine consists of alternating between
dandruff shampoo and normal shampoo
conditioner and then a little leave-in
straightening treatment and I pretty
much let my hair air dry and then just
like live my life so I'm really excited
to see if this personalized hair care
regimen can up my hair routine a little
bit and give you that extra feel like
whenever I think of hair care
commercials well I think of Eva Longoria
be like L'Oreal because I'm Eva Longoria
I think my two main hair concerns are
dandruff and or the potential for
dandruff and then also the potential to
kind of get like fluffy ends like I
think I need sweetening properties in my
shampoo otherwise it can especially at
this length we could get kind of like
Lucy at the bottom in this personalized
shampoo and conditioner can address and
solve all of my hair care needs I mean
it seems like it could be worth it to me
so I think we should take this quiz and
find out okay so I'm on dysfunction a
beauty website I think we got to go to
the yep start hair quiz let's do that
question number one hair type straight
wavy curly coily
I think I'm straight I think I'm
straight question number two hair
structure fine medium and coarse it
could be medium it could be medium okay
let's go with medium number three scalp
moisture my scalp can get pretty oily
but I also get dandruff
I wonder if damage is caused by dry
scalp or build up many people think that
a dry scalp is synonymous with dandruff
but I
they're a dry scalp or an overly oily
scalp can cause excess cells to clump
and fall off forming dandruff flakes
that is an appetizing description if I
ever heard one my scalp is so that if I
skip more than one day of washing I
start looking like a young severus snape
so I'm going to have to say oily
probably select five hair goal
definitely straighten I do like the
sound of shine
Norrish roots sounds like anti dandruff
and so does food scalp I think I'm going
to go for strengthen maybe one day I'll
be like one of those ladies whom the
Garnier Fructis commercials picking up
stuff with my hair okay that's five hair
goals customized your formula number one
shampoo color all right we're all
pastels that's fine yeah I'm just going
we're going to go over purple why not
fragrance so the one that's recommended
the whole star is the essential oil so
I'm just going to go with that one for
fragrance strength light medium strong I
don't need a strong fragrance but I like
I like my shampoos that smell like
something formula name first name or
nickname Oh nailed it choose a size and
frequency just because I'm just testing
this out I think I'm gonna go for the
eight ounces bottle of shampoo and 8
ounces bottle of conditioner 36 bucks
for a bottle of shampoo and a bottle
conditioner is not cheap but if you're
paying 18 bucks for like a really good
shampoo I've seen more expensive
shampoos out there so we'll see this
magic or not my order has been placed
these bad boys will be here in about 11
days and then we can get to suds it and
see if the stuff is worth it because
honestly I feel like whenever I try a
shampoo that doesn't quite agree with me
my dandruff let me know very quickly
okay so we've got the box it arrived
welcome to my 12 let's get into it here
is the function of Soph I'm out here
trying to function let's up shower
together guys physics is young shower
just kidding you're invited in okay
letting the hair I know I don't usually
baby the baby food on but you know got
it please a pg-13 desert here I'm sorry
like a function of thought Sam Soon what
did it smells really nice it smells very
strongly elicit and lavender whatever
the feel some stronger myself you know
sometimes when you stand or shampoo it's
like clay doesn't feel like that
targeting your dandruff specifically I
put in place out and the concern so they
know about it I wanted to be like
straight and flake free Sun filter now
shall see what you've been missing so
this is the function of soft conditioner
oh it smells so good they feel like
pretty much normal shampoo conditioner
when did it feel so much different
usually I pee in the shower for you guys
also really know right now you have
that's what secret I'll never tell
so I'm going to use this for the rest of
the week and see if I notice like a
difference in my hair I'm going to use
it till it's done but pay for but like
I'll use it for seven days you have to
see if it doesn't even go okay so it's
almost on air drying it is definitely
really soft obviously this is just one
wash so this is in the end all be all
but doesn't look much different to me
cuz my hair whoa what do you think
that's actually really nice it's softer
than usual it's like fluffier than usual
it was a little bit more pillowy so it's
been a couple days of use my shampoo and
my hair does feel really soft one thing
I'm noticing is that I'm going through
the shampoo really quickly I think it's
because I'm a little bit excited about
it I'm like hey look at this fancy
shampoo stuff I'm just going to dive
right into that I'm going through the
shampoo already probably twice as fast
like going through the conditioner but
that's like the story of my life I don't
want to use it the whole thing like
literally in a week but it was the last
you like a month or something so I need
to calm myself down okay so I've been
using this shampoo for four days one
thing that I'm pretty impressed by is
that usually if I go off of a dandruff
shampoo for a couple of days I will
start getting little flakes and then
I'll have to like use a dandruff shampoo
like once or
twice you got to get back on track and
there are no flakes so far so it is
definitely handling the scalp issue
pretty well there are no snow storms
blizzards drizzles it's pretty calm
upstairs okay so it's been about five
days of me using the shampoo and I
honestly actually really do prefer it
but I did remember why I don't usually
buy expensive shampoo Tyler why do you
have so much hands between your hands
i light like that why are they right
it's also good why are you wearing swim
trunks
usually I don't mind when Tyler uses my
bath products in fact it's pretty
expected at this point but when you've
got that expensive shampoo though since
you use this fancy shampoo how does your
hair feel today
um I can't read so there's a little bit
of gel in it so but it feels really nice
it feels pretty flake free do you get
dandruff - no so you know no so what do
you think of fine hair it's not like a
huge noticeable difference do you think
that I could pick things up with my hair
have you ever seen those commercials
what I know you're talking about hi
there - Garnier Fructis yeah it looks
stronger and it does kind of it has more
sort of fibrinous you a I'm going to try
and drag you on my hair hot go I don't
know what that experiment was I don't
know that didn't really do it but no it
feels I think that your hair feels very
sick very strong like lodging hair so
we're finishing out the week of using
this cuts of shampoo and things are
feeling great smelling great like I love
everything about my hair right now the
thing that is stopping me from being
like yeah get it is the price difference
between what I usually get and the
function of beauty haircare
I've been doing some approximate
calculation basically what we have here
is the things that I normally use I
switch off between these two shampoos
and then I use this conditioner so the
approximate cost for all of these three
things is $17.40 that includes about 24
ounces of dandruff shampoo from Target
this oh gee ex stuff that's about 13 and
a half
bounces and this stuff from l'orÃ©al
which is eight and a half ounces so both
of the function of beauty stuff are
eight ounces each and they cost $36
together so it's nearly exactly twice as
much for these guys you could probably
get close to the results of this by just
doing trial and error of like different
products at the drugstore but you're
kind of paying for like the ease of it
right you don't have to go and try
different things and like do to research
and stuff so the goals working straight
and shiny nourish roots suits Calvin
strengthen I think overall it did
accomplish those things I did try and
pick up a couple of things with my hair
yeah my hair is not long enough to pick
stuff up I obviously love the way this
stuff smells I got the essential oil
smell which to me is like minty tea
trees eucalyptus lavender the other
thing I really liked was I usually
alternate my shampoo with a dandruff
shampoo but I did not use a dandruff
shampoo at all this week and I did not
see any flakes appearing I really did
love using this stuff and I love taking
the quiz it's hard to show you like the
before and after because I don't think
that there's like a really big mark
difference in the way that it looks
though there was a comment on one of my
videos this past week that said your
hair looks very soft so maybe you can
see it my one barrier is just the price
it is twice as expensive as the stuff
that I usually buy for Less shampoo and
conditioner I'm never going to use it
down to the very bottom unless Tyler
gets there first but I'm thinking about
it I'm considering buying more but if
you're someone who spends about this
amount of money on your shampoo and
conditioner anyway this could be perfect
for you and the quiz is really fun and
also I think pretty accurate but also
really fun thank you guys so much for
