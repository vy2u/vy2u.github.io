video today I'm gonna be recreating a
viral nail art tutorial by simply me
illogical yes although they are few and
far between she does do nail art videos
sometimes so I've seen a few people
making videos where they'll try and
follow another youtubers makeup tutorial
to basically see if they can actually
recreate the look and I'm pretty sure
that Thomas Halbert started this trend
so shout out to him for being the
inspiration behind this video so today I
wanted to tackle something that I've
watched many times but never tried
before
nail art in fact I think the last time I
painted my own nails was my senior year
homecoming in high school and that's not
to say that I like to get my nails done
all the time my nails are usually maked
they're kind of long claw like one of
them's often a bit snaggly so with that
I invite you all to look at them very
closely for the next 10 minutes as I
attempt my very first nail art tutorial
all right
let's dive right in now if you don't
know who's simply no logical is she
makes a lot of really cool nail videos
and she's very good at painting her
nails her cat's men she and Zeiler as
well as her boyfriend may often make
guest appearances and she has what some
may call an extremely healthy obsession
with holographic stuff so the tutorial
I've chosen is from about a year and a
half ago and it is this DIY raindrop
multi chrome nails so not hollow but
close-ish now as a person who's never
really done nail art before I didn't
really have any of the supplies so we
had to go out and get a bunch of this
stuff I don't have the exact products
that Christine does so if you want to
like do this in real life I would
recommend what she's using and not
necessarily what I'm using unless it
turns out really good in which case I
recommend what I'm using all right so
let's see what Christine has in store
for us
to truly the unrecognized like vocal
talent of this generation I feel like
you know if I did a cover of that song
I'd probably have to take the like
baritone part well hallo everyone it's
me christine again and hallo
christine no that's not actually water
on my nails but it could be what
technique around for a long time on
instagram think we call it the water
droplet technique I really like this
rain technique she's done but it's
unclear if it's beginner-friendly or not
so I guess we'll see I'm starting off
with the peel off base coat classic so
Christine always uses a peel off base
coat because she peels all of her nail
art off and keeps it in a little ziplock
bag that she actually does carry around
with her when she travels I've seen it
in person and it is pretty much just as
hoarders episode II as you would think
all right so let me show you how I apply
a peel off base coat I feel like that's
too thick oh oh
ignore that oh no oh no how am I doing
this wrong that nail is snaggly
I know once it gets long it starts like
curving under itself yeesh
maybe I should invest more care into my
course about to call them gropers what
my hands my claws my talents talents
that's I wanted talents I think here's
the thing about this tutorial you just
started I'm not very good at applying
nail polish evenly so I feel like even
if I get like the effects right like the
base is just gonna be lumpy all right so
I think that I've applied the peel off
base coat so I'm just gonna wait a
couple seconds for the base coat to dry
I don't think I'm ready to move on until
it's not white anymore
whoo maybe I should get a hair dryers
I'm gonna do that okay well I don't know
if it's Christine approved but it seems
logical simply no logical
uh-huh too hot for my Gophers I feel
like it shouldn't be taking this long to
dry I feel like I shouldn't be taking
this long for just the first step all
right so the middle finger is still
white and like not dried but I feel like
we can start with the next step and then
hopefully by the time we get to the
middle finger it'll be clear so let's
listen to what Christine says to do next
now I'm applying one thin coat of black
gel polish okay so black gel it is the
bottle of this polish does look a bit
like a very tall college graduate so I'm
gonna try and dab someone for the Polish
on the sides of the bottle so it doesn't
get too lumpy whoo yes Oh No maybe I
dabbed off too much it's not really
coming off in the most even way it does
not smell like normal nail polish this
smells more like mothballs
so like equally as toxic but like not as
fun the weird thing is I swear I was
like pretty decent at coloring like
inside the lines as a child but I'm very
bad at putting nail polish inside the
lines why does that middle nail look
like a very expired reason it just it
looks like a really really really sad
grape
I think the gel is kind of migrating
away from the center of the nail and
like into my nail bed so that's not
ideal so the thing is we're about a
minute and 27 seconds into Christine's
tutorial these are the steps that she's
kind of whizzing by and I'm still stuck
on them oh my god that one just
completely dripped off this is not going
well all right I think I'm ready for the
next step so with gel polish you got to
put it under a fancy purple alien light
thing and then that cures it as they
call it so we got a lamp which I'm now
nervous to pick up because the gel
polish is running off of my fingers here
it is here's our lamp and here the
quartz boom all right I want to turn
this on is it starting start oh oh it's
on oh it's hot in there oh oh it's okay
actually Christine called it an alien
light yeah it does sort of feel like a
beam me up Scotty type thing oh is that
it
are they dry nope nope I'm gonna put
them in for another 30 seconds oh do you
see that well
well I don't think that my gel nails are
completely dry so I'm just gonna keep
curing them until they're dry see for
your hand I don't know you think my
hands gonna end up being like really tan
or something all right so we're gonna
call this cured it's not a hundred
percent dry dry but it is definitely
harder to do that for every coat so I've
cured one coat of black gel polish and
now I'm applying a second coat to make
it actually opaque all right so we're
gonna do a second coat like she says to
hopefully also make it opaque hers did
look better to start with though simple
C I actually think that one of my
problems was that I was like moving my
hands around too much after I applied
the first coat so I'll try not to like
lift my hands up I'm sorry if
Christine's watching this all right so I
think that's done I'm gonna go with I'm
done so let's see what Christine does
next now I'm applying a glossy gel
topcoat because the magic did she's a
top coat and not taco whose video is
this
so her next step is to add a gel topcoat
and then cure it again woah that's thick
I feel like I'm putting so much product
on my nails they're gonna end up looking
like bubble nails and also weirdly full
oh no are you talking too much see how
does she do that she does voiceover
doesn't change it she doesn't say it
while she's doing you idiot focus damn
you Christine alright so I'm gonna put
these back into the machine raindrops
keep falling on my nails I don't
remember the rest of it alright so I
think I'm all done cheering I think that
I've also somewhat fused my middle
finger nail to my middle finger but
hopefully that'll just peel right off
alright so what's up next for Christine
the nail Queen to avoid some of the mess
from the powder which is one thing I
absolutely hated about doing this the
last time around I'm using one of these
pili apron thingies
alright so we're putting an apron on
which I probably should have actually
been wearing the entire time Oh Vic I
don't think I'm doing this right it kind
of looks like my nails are gonna do like
an 80s Jazzercise class they keep coming
undone why is this happening to me
Christine why are these nail aprons that
you didn't recommend not working for me
literally every time I push one of them
down another one flops up this is
like not okay look look at this it's
like a game of whack-a-mole damn it
alright so with our aprons on I think
we're gonna move on to the next step so
there's a few different ways to do this
you could use your finger 1 million
years or an eyeshadow applicator like
this today I'm going with the basic
bitch approach then you just rub it on
all right so Christy's next step is to
apply the multi chrome powder with one
of those little spongey eyeshadow
applicators so I couldn't find this like
dark multi chrome powder anywhere in
person in LA but we're lucky enough that
like one of our friends Lauren runs a
nail art salon called color camp so she
lent us some
Brian and I think I've got the music
from the video stuck in my head that's
the McDonald's theme song burner from
yeah I'm bad at nails Oh sparkly oh my
god I feel like a real nail artist this
is so fun even though my middle nail is
kind of raisiny it does look like a
beautiful metallic raisin now can I put
this stuff on my face or is that's not a
good idea the only thing I'm seeing is
that like you can sort of see like where
the gel sort of bleeds off my finger but
we're just gonna keep trudging ahead
alright you ready for the thumb I'm just
gonna take this apron off
screw the leg warmer we're going
commando no but actually like how toxic
is this like what would happen if I put
this on my lips alright so I think I'm
done with my multi chrome powder my
nails are a total Monet like far away
looks great up close total mess they're
thick they're misshapen and they're
living in the city alright so let's see
what's up next for Christine now we're
gonna add another glossy gel taco to
seal the powders in there we go there's
the taco I could go for a taco right now
as well hey Tyler why haven't you
brought me my tea yet BAM
then is that my teeth man not you oh my
god
Thank You Tyler where's my tea
oh wow you've brought me my almost
completely finished
iced coffee from this morning Thank You
Tyler such a good thing
thank you drink slave that will be all
we come back I need you to keep filming
please so I think now that I'm all cured
again I think we're pretty much done
with like the base of this look so let's
see what Kristine has in store next oh
no did we forget what's on my other
hands all right so I guess it's time for
what's on my other hand which is
literally nothing what's so on this hand
it's nothing all right so after that
very enlightening segment what's next to
do the raindrop effect I wanted to make
the background a little match so I would
have a contrast between the shiny
raindrops and the background all right
so I guess the next step is to add a
matte topcoat
tako am atacó at this point my nails are
just like blocks like they're not really
nails anymore they're just like
sedimentary formations this one is so
mad the middle one wait why don't the
other ones drawing like that I'm gonna
have to add a little bit more of the
matte topcoat to the other one so it
matches hello
me and my giant raisins are pleased to
make your acquaintance all right so
after the matte topcoat I think we only
have one place left to go
and that's raindrop so let's see how she
does it
now I'm taking some gel topcoat I put it
on my nail art mat and I'm just taking a
tiny brush and painting dots on it
pretty simple I said it was easy I
didn't lie did she say this was easy
damn so I'm just gonna dot a little bit
of my gel topcoat onto the back of this
package here and then use that as my
nail art mat and draw some raindrops try
and not mess up a circle there we go
that's a raindrop all right so I think
my process here is that I'm gonna draw a
couple of like big guys and then fill in
the blank space with little dots so I
think I'm gonna cure those because I
suspect that if you don't cure them
there's a danger of like the raindrops
literally dripping down your name
thank you I did mostly everything else
incorrectly so hopefully at least one
thing was okay now we're just gonna cure
it so we can make the balls hard haha
ooh
are my balls hard I think they are kind
of fun right now let's get some shifting
corn in it Oh a whole new type of nail
polish it porn alright so she's moved on
to porn so I think we're done with our
nails look at that oh yeah I feel like
my nails are just like individual cement
blocks that someone might want to karate
chop through the worst one by far is my
middle finger the index finger is a
close second worst but the thumb is my
favorite it still looks like a human
nail and it's got that sassy reptile
multi chrome thing happening alright so
I guess in this video Christine didn't
do any peel porn which is sort of when
she will peel up her nail art that she
just did but maybe she just wanted to
like keep these nails on for a while
which I understand I don't really want
to take them off my nails either except
for the middle finger that fucker could
go so despite that I think we should try
and peel them up right now I'm gonna try
maybe from this side uh what oh oh oh oh
it's coming off oh wow how it's kind of
stuck to my skin over here oh I think
I'm actually just trying to take my
entire nail off with that one so let's
not do that
oh here it's coming here we go mmm
Wow I can see why Christine likes to do
this cuz this is fun oh here we go oh
that was kind of violent then we're like
fracture porn yeah so those are all my P
Lee's they're very solid my nails are
very dirty and covered in gel polish but
I'm very very pleased with these little
creations alright so with the completion
of the fracture porn as I'm gonna call
it I think that we've completed my very
first attempt at a nail tutorial I think
that I did okay I think that the gel
polish is honestly what threw me for a
loop
I probably should have like painted and
cure
every single individual finger and
hopefully that would have like stopped
some of the runoff but besides that once
we got to the multi chrome powder I felt
like I was really like getting into the
groove and in the end I think my nails
came out pretty good they didn't look so
good when you thought about the actual
shape that someone's nails should be but
if you didn't think about that
then they looked okay I feel like what
might motivate me to keep doing nail
tutorials is to start my own pili
collection it's fun it's like a little
