video this week I'm going to be trying
out period leggings that's right you
guys it is that time of the month once
more now when I first heard of these
period leggings I was intrigued so I
thought as an avid leggings wearer and a
period haver that I got to try these
things so I got myself a couple pairs
basically they are a legging with I
believe like a pad replacement built in
they are made by this company called
panty prop which on their website seems
to have a few different offerings ok so
here's one right here I ordered two
pairs of leggings just because as I
remembered with the period panties there
is a decent amount of laundering
happening it looks pretty much like a
legging it's got a nice soft material
and then on the inside it looks like
this I'm very interested in the design
of this there's a mesh sort of layering
and then right here there's got some
fleece in there it is not incredibly
thick it's actually not very bulky at
all but the seams are from the outside
are like pretty noticeable well we'll
see what it looks like when it's on huh
so before I try these on I just want to
thank clew for sponsoring this video
clue is an app that tracks your period
we've got some period leggings here I'm
on my period it's all coming together so
the app is called clue like the board
game but there is no mystery it is just
always miss Scarlett in my pants with
the in convenient timing clue is a free
app it's available on iOS and Android
basically what clue does is it tracks
your cycle your period PMS and ovulation
here is my calendar it's also rated the
number one app for tracking your cycle
by doctors and medical researchers flu
also sends you push notifications when
you're about to start your period I've
been using clue for the last couple of
months the more you use clue the better
it gets at predicting your cycle so for
me I usually focus on like the blood
aspect but you can also add pain
emotions sleep sexy times and there's
actually a new feature that lets you
share your cycle with other people
currently only Tyler gets it
yes I do but he loves it yes I do so
once again thank you to clue for your
support I'm gonna try these pants on now
okay so I've got a little card that they
gave me they said recommended for use
what Oh additional protection should be
worn with this product when you are
experiencing heavy leakage it's weird
because on their website they say that
it's a leak proof legging and you can
wear it alone depending on your flow but
on this card it says recommended for use
with pads tampons and menstrual cups and
that it's intended to help secure and
conceal a pad I'm a little confused
currently I am on my first day of my
period I was gonna have my first a B day
2 which is tomorrow during the day which
is probably like my heaviest day so I
will get a pad to use with my period
legging tomorrow later in the week
though I will go commando am I doing
this right what you mean was I supposed
to be doing something else is there
something wrong
what's there to write around oh I guess
I was just assuming that I think we're
these like I wear leggings like I just
wear leggings like around but I think
maybe that these are not that kind of
liking maybe they're banking on the fact
that people like don't just like look at
other you know people's crotches so then
I don't actually notice that you have
what seems to be a sack of potatoes down
there I'm all surprised that it's it's
so noticeable from the outside on the
website they have like a lot of
different like active kind of like
examples so it's kind of like for
dancing for yoga they feel like good
leggings in terms of like working out
like the material feels nice but the
protrusion of the pad part it's not
ideal I think we might have to work
around it
ok so it is day 2 in the morning I've
got a pad I've got my period leggings
basically you're just supposed to take
your pad
one handed pad action when I saw that
they actually intended that you wear it
with a pad on heavier days I was a
little disappointed but I thought it was
only fair to follow their directions so
I'm basically just gonna put this right
on the gusset it's a great name I don't
Gus it means but I'm I'm here for it
smooth it down on the top smooth it down
on the bottom and then turn them right
side out and then wear them so I put my
leggings with my pad on can you tell I
kind of you know tried to arrange the
flannel arms so that they just drop
right in front of the cross that is a
convenient sleeve right there okay so
we're at the mall we're gonna get some
coffee all of dinner as I'm walking it
does feel a little bit bulky it doesn't
feel not secure like it doesn't feel
like it's gonna start shifting around
but it's definitely a bulk I can feel so
I didn't have any issues in terms of
leaking I thought that the flannel arms
would like move when I walked I don't
know if it was a particularly still day
like there was a lot of wind happening
but it actually covered it up pretty
well the only time you can see it is I
go like this kind of swing around I'm
doing this and it's actually making my
leggings ride down a bit so the pads
going with them maybe don't maybe don't
do that no I just have to think of other
things to wrap around my waist this week
other like longer tops or like maybe
dresses to wear over it so just you know
thinking on what I can put around my
waist day three I wanted to give it a
workout spin okay so I'm gonna head down
to the gym right now I have put a pad in
my leggings so I am going to see how
these fare like on the treadmill
sweating general motion
I know if you look a little bulky and a
little slippery so probably not ideal
for like running when your are least my
thighs like rub together but you know
we'll see oh the pouch is in like full
view yeah the pouch this does offer you
the no underwear but have a secure pad
option
I'm not really used to running while
wearing a pad so to me it kind of felt a
little sweaty and like a little bit
wrinkly but there were no leaking issues
running alone on a treadmill actually
doesn't draw a lot of attention to the
weirdness of the the gusset diaper oh we
gotta be honest feel like if you're
running you can't see the whole pouch it
was more the trip back and forth from
the gym where I was like so I've worn
both of my period leggings I have two
pairs at this point so I'm gonna put
them in the wash it says you can just
machine wash them
so I'm machine washing them and as long
as you don't dry them on high heat you
should be fine let's you know lower
maintenance and my usual workout like it
was to be honest all right they are done
I'm nervous to put them in the dryer
just because I never put like athletic
leggings and dryers so I'm gonna air dry
these right here and then in the morning
hopefully they should be ready to go the
gusset is like quite fleecy and thick so
I hope maybe I'll try and fold it over
by the gusset let the gusset get more
air that word I've honestly I've never
used that word before but it feels so
appropriate you said it a lot this week
next morning the gussets are looking
good so it is a day four of my period
day three of wearing these leggings I
also wore a pad on day four just because
it's kind of like a medium flow day for
me I have Candace here right now we're
about to go film another like Instagram
makeup trend type video so I am wearing
a little like dress tunic type thing to
conceal the crotch hand is had no idea
what was going on under there I'm gonna
show you my my crotch are you okay with
that not like bear I was gonna ask you
where you got them they're kind of like
panty liner built-in leggings but
there's one catch that is camel toes I
think like me she was just expecting
them to look like normal leggings
they're cute like almost like that said
the tunic did cover up the crotch very
well you know it kind of hit at the mid
thigh so for the first three days I wore
the period leggings I followed their
instructions and put a pad in it and
that resulted in me not really having a
lot of like leakages or issues with the
absorbency but I still had three days of
period left
and the last three days of my period are
pretty like medium to light days so I
went commando just me and the gusset all
right so it is day five and I'm finally
ready to put on my period leggings
without anything underneath them I
really wanted to test a different type
of workout so I went to the yoga class
on day five okay so I'm about to walk
into yoga class and I am feeling pretty
comfortable like pretty comfortable dry
like the gusset feels pretty nice feels
kind of pillowy I'm just worried about
as I said before how it looks I was a
little bit self-conscious I'm not gonna
lie but I think something about yoga
class actually unfurled the gusset I
think when standing and walking the
gusset looks bulkier then when you're
kind of like stretched out in warrior
two
I will say that I don't think anyone was
looking I think if anyone saw they might
have just glanced away like I'm not sure
what that is but I didn't notice anyone
being like okay so I'm walking out of
yoga overall nothing bad happened like
there were no leaks no like stray like
strong smells or anything I would say
over the course of the week this cell
was pretty much on par with wearing a
pad I felt pretty dry throughout the
whole thing definitely feels less bulky
without a pad underneath I would say
once again though that like walking back
and forth from the yoga studio that's
the most awkward part in my opinion
anyway I'm gonna head home now and
probably from the amount of sweating I
did today
Jews grow these guys three back in the
wash so Dave six during the day I was
editing all day and finishing a video
but during the evening I put my period
leggings on and he went to Disneyland
for a few hours I decided to wear this
like warm like dress with like cutouts
on the side type thing I don't usually
wear this thing but in a situation where
I'm wearing leggings I also need to
cover like my crotch this like sort of
loincloth almost fit is perfect I think
that in Disneyland I noticed a couple
more drops than I had the day before
just kind of like the last dregs really
just making themselves known I was
really pretty high and dry discret it's
like you know the last few days until
about 2:00
walking and I felt like a nice
doesn't feel like it's it feels absurd
but I definitely like felt it and then
it was there and it's still kind of it
so I was a little nervous but I don't
think there was any leaking issues at
least I didn't notice any but Disneyland
does involve a lot of walking more than
with any other type of activity just
walking around for a while the leggings
did ride down a little bit and something
that you probably want with a pad type
period product is that it's flush
against your body by the end of the
night I noticed this stitching on the
side is actually slightly chafing a
little bit but we have been walking a
lot and I'm not like in any pain I'm
just noticing it but overall it's
handling the trip to Disneyland pretty
well as long as I have the aesthetics of
it disguised I'm fine with it the last
day of my period arrived day seven was
just like a busy work day hanging around
on the computer sending emails eating
gelato I think it's actually easier to
disguise the crotch region that I
thought it might be this flannel is just
like Tyler's flannel that I'm wearing
today and it's long enough interestingly
enough this week has been less of like a
does this period product work week and
more like a can I style around this
period product week just because to me
that's the biggest hurdle I really love
wearing leggings especially when I'm
just kind of sitting around on the
computer and these leggings were pretty
good to sit around it I just feel kind
of warm like it's just like an extra
layer of fuzziness
it's not anything to really write home
about oh and all I have mixed feelings
about these leggings on the positive
side I do think the gusset provides a
good place for a pad to stick if you're
someone who likes to wear pads on your
period and doesn't want to wear
underwear under leggings I also think
that the leggings themselves are
decently comfortable and I think it
works pretty well when you're exercising
but only really when you're in the act
of exercising which brings me to my main
complaint the aesthetics after I had
first tried these on I went back to the
website to see if I had just missed the
gusset or just to see if I got like a
defective pair but looking at the
website the first two pictures you can't
see any sign of a gusset
it's the third picture that you have to
click through where you can kind of see
the gusset
so I guess I just didn't get that far
it's not that I expect there to be no
bulk in a period legging but just
there's literally a square or that
wrinkles up and it's just like wrinkly
crotch take a look
my other gripe with it is that it just
didn't commit I think that if I'm gonna
be wearing a period legging that has
quite a bulky pad or gusset in the
middle I would expect that this wouldn't
need additional reinforcement I would
love to have a pair of period leggings
that I could just throw on and not have
to wear anything with and it feels like
that's what this company was trying to
make but they just weren't ready to
commit to it that said if you are
someone who exclusively wears long
tunics and also really likes to wear
pads maybe this could work for you but
if you are someone who wears a lot of
crop tops I would say probably not thank
