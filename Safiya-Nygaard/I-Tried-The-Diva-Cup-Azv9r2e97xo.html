home - you're living in dangerous times
you guys hello friends and welcome to
another video this week I'm coming back
atcha with another period video that's
right the period videos are back we
missed last month because I tried
something for a couple of days and it
didn't really work out for me and then
there was also this added part where it
wasn't really FDA approved in fact it
was like FDA like not approved and then
I was like maybe we should just scrap it
this month weeks this week we're going
to be taking on the Diva Cup I've heard
a lot about the Diva Cup I in fact have
made other people try it for a video
before but I've never gotten to try this
or any other menstrual cup myself so
we're going to dive right in so a Diva
Cup is basically like a silicone Cup
that you fold up shove up and then it
will catch the blood it'll catch the
fall and then once it's filled up you
take it out dump it out rinse it out and
you can use it again you can leave it up
in there for 12 hours it's like more eco
friendly as a tampon girl and pretty
excited about the idea of a different
kind of period product that's also
internal I really liked certain aspects
of the period Panzi that I tried a
couple months ago but the worst part by
far was the squish like the feeling of
the drop and so anything that can catch
the blood before that happened I'm
interested to try once again it is day
one of my period and you guys might know
that my period is seven days long so
tonight's test we'll be sleeping in it
and seeing if there were any weeks and
then tomorrow is day two of course so
that'll be an exciting day day two is
always abundant I'm excited to see if
the Diva Cup and I can become friends
this week so I'm going to take my Diva
Cup out of its box and we're going to
get more involved in a different type of
box I'm sorry I didn't want to say my
box but
so I have my little diva cup here it's
pretty squishy it's not too big it looks
bigger in the box for some reason it's
got the Diva Cup engraved right here and
then it has like a little sort of
measuring line to see how many ounces of
blood you produced so from the box it
says there are two different types of
ways to fold it the first one is like
this I don't know if you can see that
words like you fold up front and then
you kind of close and then the second
one is like you fully taco it the full
taco seems like the one that makes the
most sense to me so perfect hold it like
that the instructions say to wash this
and wash your hands so we're going to do
that and then we're going to head right
into it
wish me luck I'm going to put you right
here
step one is is relax
step two is fold okay and then so three
is like the negotiation and this is not
easy
what oh okay I think that it's it
unfurled Wow
this is a pretty hands-on project now
what happened
step four or whatever step four arms is
rotate how can I find it where is it oh
here it is
tell us first okay I don't know that I
can rotate this let me know I read that
again I don't know about rotation okay
okay I think I've done actually I've
been thinking long as I was I was think
probably only check let me see lol be
recording oh three minutes alright so
that wasn't as difficult as I thought it
would be I can definitely tell where it
is kind of but it doesn't feel too
uncomfortable but I'm kind of like
moving around gyrating trying to let it
settle in I actually feel pretty secure
so well actually I have no idea I don't
know I just said that I'm setting the
towel down because I'm a little bit
nervous I'm just playing it safe
good night and good luck Judy okay well
it looks like it's all clear on my end
the morning of day two I was pretty
groggy so what I was saying in my vlogs
was pretty incoherent
it does feel not super dry it definitely
feels a little bit of moisture down
there what I meant was that
weren't any leaks on the towel overnight
but when I woke up I did feel like not
completely dry downstairs I'm also
having the weirdest sensation of little
bubbles I really know how else to say
that but just like little bubbles and
then when I stood up and started walking
around I actually felt a couple of air
bubbles kind of escape from the cup yeah
I'm gonna hop in the shower wake myself
up I'm up and Adam everything is sort of
where it's supposed to be now after
about 15 to 20 minutes of wrestling with
the cup so I tried to take the Diva Cup
out in the shower because I heard that
if you can change it in and out in the
shower it's pretty ideal night captain
Morgan did and then I tried to grab it
by the little step I could find the sim
but I could not get it out standing up
at all so that I want to take it out
over the toilet taking it out was
definitely an ordeal it's just it's
difficult to really get a good grip on
that nub and once you do have a good
grip on it you have to take it out all
the way in like one motion because if
you let go of the nubs to like take a
rest
it'll just scoop back on up there it'll
just be like well it kind of takes a
decent amount of hand strength to be
honest but actually getting a back end
wasn't too bad it's supposed to be fine
for 12 hours so after all the time it
took this morning you do get a good
payoff of like oh you don't really have
to do it again for a while so most
everything was stowed away I had a
pretty uneventful day like I was doing
some editing I ran a few errands I just
kind of forgot about it and I didn't
really feel anything I didn't really
like have any concerns until a whole 12
hours later when I felt the air bubbles
returned okay you guys it's 10:30 at
night I think earlier I said that there
was like bubbles happening and some just
kind of emerged and I think that means
that it's starting to leak I think that
means that I'm losing suction okay
I'm home now so nothing terrible
happened
it definitely leaked so like after the
bubbling like I kind of felt the squelch
it's not like really running but it's
definitely time to change it out I was
impressed by the longevity of the
coverage though today like there was a
lot of time today when I was flying high
and like not really worrying about my
period so that's pretty cool
I slept in a little bit but still does
leak so that's awesome
left the towel down last night again
just in case but we are all clear all
quiet on the downstairs front so
actually managed to take it out without
dumping it out immediately so I saw like
it filled a cup doesn't absorb nor mud
it just catches it you do get to get a
good look at it which is kind of a weird
experience but it was still
disconcerting to see it was just like oh
okay so I'm going to work out with my
Diva Cup we are going to go on a hike
right now we're going to see I don't
know if anything weird happens if if it
shifts around during flight yeah the box
says ultimate freedom
enjoy all daily activities yoga swimming
camping dancing even extreme sports and
more okay so hiking should be fine so
while I was hiking things were going
pretty well going up with great and then
coming back down there was just like two
times roach plugins a little extra
gravity like just a bubble illness or
air pressure check a couple of air
bubbles escaped again I think on day two
the air bubbles escaping kind of meant
that the cup was filled up but on day
three it felt more like things were just
JA sewing around I think this could also
just be like growing pains like I'm
getting used to the cup the cups getting
used to me I would say like exercising
like 9 out of 10 obviously we didn't run
but we were like hiking you know we were
like so in between uses of the Diva Cup
you are supposed to remove it and wash
it with mild soap and then you can
pretty much just reuse it right then and
there but it does say that you can boil
it as needed Tyler will you do the
honors of holding this camera while this
process happens what as needed it may be
boiled for 5 to 10 minutes
in an open pot with plenty of water why
is it as needed right now I don't know
do not mean boiling pot unattended
if you accidentally burn your cup your
cup may be ruined
I'm nervous okay can you see it those
people could play you in there all right
five minutes I mean let's do five
minutes just to be on the safe side good
ones being boiled it's like like goodbye
germs you know okay turning it off right
now I'm melted no it looks okay yeah I'm
going to let it cool down and then we're
going to get back to business I feel
good actually I'm actually really glad
we did that because it was a little
weird to me that you could just like oh
rinse it out with a little bit of soap
and just pop it right back in like I was
like wanting just clean it more so this
makes me feel better
I can't sing a song song about it that's
the only I don't like focusing so do
five rolls around and something that
I've always wondered and I've heard
other people expresses concern too is if
you were ever upside down with the Diva
Cup would the blood just trickle back up
so I decided to you know do a little
upside down action and see if I could
feel anything happening I'm not going to
doing it then because I can't do one but
I can probably do it that's pretty good
are you feeling Thanks no doing anything
now the thing is you can't really feel
it dropping into the cup so maybe it was
trickling back up but I don't think
you'd be able to feel it heading it's
fine honestly you guys I think this this
part is fine one of the advantages of
the Diva Cup for me was that you can
leave it in for 12 hours I kind of got
away with not changing it outside of my
house for the whole week up until they
fix I wanted to try and change might be
the cup in a different environment like
just at my house but all they have been
looking in the bathroom in Salinas I've
been and none of them were single stall
bathrooms they're all like multiple
stall bathrooms there's a little bit of
a trip you have to do between the toilet
and the sink and then back to the toilet
I don't really feel like comfortable
doing it in a multiple stall bathroom
I'm just going to wait like NL the idea
of having to change it in public without
access to a single stall bathrooms just
makes me nervous you could probably do
it if you were super sneaky but I would
be I would be like me there so it's day
seven and day six and seven for me are
really just like spotting and light flow
days and so when I took my diva cup out
this morning there wasn't really much to
speak of in there so I decided to go
without the cup today just think on
earlier days in your period when the
Diva Cup can really sore it made sense
to use it but then on later Flo days
when you're really just spotting or not
bleeding very much going through the
drama of putting it in and taking it out
doesn't really make sense to me and I
decided to wear my Fink's period song
from last time I did a period video you
know like you can just sort of throw on
the period song catch whatever's left
and not have to worry about like messing
around overall I did like the Diva Cup I
do think the Diva Cup and I became
friends over the course of this week my
favorite part by far is when it's doing
this thing like when it's already up
there and you can just leave it up there
for 12 hours like I kind of forgot about
it for a while and I wasn't really
worrying about it because you can leave
it up there for longer so there was a
peace of mind element to this I wouldn't
really blame the leaking incident on the
cup I think the couple is literally like
hey I last for 12 hours and then 12
hours later it was like 12 hours and I
was like notice I'm pretty sure that
period odours appear when your period
blood hits the air so you don't smell
anything
unless usually I also thought that it
was pretty easy to clean pretty easy to
boil I boiled it twice at this point and
like seems pretty much the same you just
got a watching to make sure you don't
actually just burn it to a crisp my only
issue with it it's just like the
learning curve and also just like the
drama surrounding putting it in and
taking it out it's just it's still a
little difficult
I actually you think I would use it
again like I'm pretty down for it I'll
just have to practice it's not that easy
but once it's there then life is easy
until you got to take it out again thank
