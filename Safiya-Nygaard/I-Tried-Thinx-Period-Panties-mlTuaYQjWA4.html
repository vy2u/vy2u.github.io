baritone I'm on my period
oh hello friends and welcome to another
video this week we're going to be trying
out the think period panties you guys
can't see these things because I've
hidden them moderately well but there's
a pimple grouting above my eyebrows and
the top button of my pants are undone
because I'm on my period that's right I
started early this morning I'm not a
morning person but apparently my period
is the biggest period panties have been
out for a little while and they're
advertised basically as just like normal
underwear that can replace a pad or can
act as a panty liner on a really heavy
day they have different pairs of panties
like they have more heavy duty ones for
sort of your more heavier flow days and
they also have a song which is just for
the lighter days I have made other
people try period panties for video
before but I've never tried period
panties myself and very excited to do so
in front of all you wonderful people
they wanted my period is pretty much
over and as you guys know I have a seven
day period most of my bleeding happens
on days one two and three four and five
are kind of like medium and then six and
seven are just like first I've been a
tampon user since I was about 16 so I'm
really excited to try something new this
month and get my claws into these
panties so I got these three pairs of
period panties a hip hugger a sport and
a song I have really high hopes I've
heard good things it's supposed to feel
dry and comfortable and you don't have
to worry about changing a tampon or
changing out a pad I'm just really
excited to try these guys out and see if
thanks is worth it lives up to the hype
and if this is a magical period product
that everyone should honestly have it is
very late at night so I'm about to go to
bed I am going to wear one of these guys
to sleep tonight high six hopefully I
don't ruin the sheets that would be very
sad time to put my first pair of period
panties on I'm going to start with a hip
hugger
the hip hugger is 34 bucks and it's
supposed to hold about two tampons works
I'm going to try and put them on one
hand it here's a hip hundred from the
front
here's hip-huggers from the back
let them put these guys on okay so they
feel really soft they do feel a little
bit like swimwear I got the size medium
you can definitely tell that there's a
lining around the crotchal area it feels
a little more secure that I thought in
life they are on on the outside they
feel a lot like a swimsuit bottom but
they aren't pretty comfortable on the
inside they do feel mostly like normal
underwear
they sit a little tight around my leg
opening but that makes sense because you
want to like have everything contained
I'm a huge fan of the fact that they
have this kind of like mesh at the top
the mesh waistband is super comfortable
it sends a hose to tampon worth so I say
let's just get into it I am NOT going to
put any towel down because I like to
live dangerously also ignore the fact
that my sheets are extremely wrinkly I'm
about to turn in for the night I just
felt something drop here's to hoping I
can keep it in my panties okay bye guys
guess what there is nothing other shapes
I feel pretty dry I wouldn't say I feel
a hundred percent desert dry I'm going
to shower and put on the other pair but
I would have to wash these because I'm
gonna have to wear these again later
today or tonight I think my biggest
issues is going to be I'm going to have
to be doing laundry a lot maybe I should
have bought more underwear so I just
took off the hip huggers that I slept in
and threw them in the laundry while
those guys are being washed let's go for
the sport
panties it's 32 dollars a pair and it
flows about one and a half tampons work
oh my god did you see on the front it
says real menstruating human to man they
didn't know that I am a human
I am dancer this is a sport panty from
the front and this is the sport fancy
from the back this one is the same
material as the last one it does feel a
little less thick but I can still feel
the lining on the inside so these guys
are supposed to hold one and a half
tampons worth so that should last me for
a good few hours so I'm actually doing a
photo shoot right now and my period
panties are holding up very well I will
say though that I was sitting down and I
was so nervous that the underwear would
like shift a little and it would leak
out from the sides but so far so good
too
they do I may have run into a disaster I
think I underestimated my flow and I
haven't had a chance to go home and my
panties have runneth over
I couldn't tell that I had filled it up
until I went to the bathroom and
realized the blood had soaked through to
the other side crap I can't go home to
get the other pair for a couple of hours
they said this one is supposed to only
be one and a half tampons worth which
should be enough for like a few hours
for me but maybe day two is just too
intense I'm just gonna try and not sit
down and hopefully it'll just be able to
hold up until I can go home I didn't
think to throw the song or like the
extra panty in my bag which is my bad
but also like I'm sad that this happened
okay so I'm finally home I think the
pants you do a pretty good job of
keeping in the smell until you bleed
through and then the smell kind of
starts percolating it was rank so I
washed the sport panties and they are
drying on the drying rack look at my
sport panties it's drying you can barely
even tell that I just completely soaked
through it it washes out quite nicely
I also washed a bunch of my yoga pants
when we're going to the mall right now
and I put on my hip huggers because
they're going out for a few hours I
don't want to risk it with the song so
right now I have like full coverage
underwear and some extra padding around
the crotch and some pants it doesn't do
on cultural necessarily it just feels
local like a moring little bit of white
hat you know yeah you're smacking your
button I know it's only because I can't
really feel it because there's so much
padding so I'm just like what went in
your butt so we went to the mall and we
came back and my period panties are very
dry and warm very warm because there's
lots of layers happening the size dot
they're pretty comfortable it is a
little bulky still mostly just sitting
and editing today I feel good about just
wearing the sports panty
today I think we should be okay for a
little while and then maybe I'll throw
the song on at the end of the day the
last hair that I bought was the song I
was so fascinated by the idea of a song
being a period pansy that I thought I
had to try it got it right here so the
song is $24 and it holds about half of
the
tampons worth it's definitely got some
coverage in the front though a true song
in the back we're going to be out for
like an hour too so hopefully it'll be
fine the thing I'm really excited about
for the song is the mesh waist band I'm
here for the mesh waistband you guys
know I would never put period panty and
sexy lingerie
in the same room so I'm pretty impressed
that they were like no we're going to
make it song it's not not cute it feels
extremely comfortable besides the fact
that the front is kind of slippery and
swimsuit E it feels almost exactly like
a normal phone we're out at in and out
I'm wearing my period song and I feel
great actually I can't say that the
river is rushing forth right now it's
actually pretty calm downstairs
unintended consequence of wearing this
song Tyler just screaming the song song
at every turn losin I've been walking in
sitting today I wore my sports brief
even though the hip huggers let's do the
one that holds the most liquid I find
that the sport panties feels a little
bit bulkier it's day six I'm just
killing and editing again and I'm
wearing the song and I feel very
comfortable and very secure it does have
a used it's great for like those last
couple of days where you're just like if
I didn't wear anything something bad
might happen but I just need a little
something so it's day seven and I'm
wearing my song under a legging it's
actually quite comfortable but I didn't
realize is that I haven't exercised all
on these guys but just to try it out I
will get to yoga tonight in this song so
I just got back from yoga there's
obviously a lot of stretching a little
bit of sweating definitely a lot of like
crotchal movement I know today's the
last day of my period so it's not the
best day to actually see if I would have
bled through my clothes but I thought
they were comfortable under my yoga
pants I didn't feel like I had a wedgie
I didn't feel like it was gathered up
the hottest myth sweatiest I've been is
when I wore the period panties under
Jean but under yoga pants they seem
pretty breathable so my period is over
now and so is my first think period
panties period overall as a tampon user
I found the first couple of days to be
kind of off-putting because I'm just not
used to
feeling of the drop besides the one day
that I overflowed it wasn't too wet it
wasn't 100% dry but it definitely wasn't
wet feeling my biggest issue with these
period panties or how expensive they are
they run it about like 25 to 30 bucks
each which is pretty steep and unlike a
Diva Cup or something you don't need
just one I managed to get through the
week with just three but I was doing
laundry like constantly so I think like
if you're going to use just period
panties you kind of need like five or
six so I actually found the song really
great to just throw on for the last
couple of days of my period just to kind
of like catch anything left my least
favourite pair were the sport panties I
think now I also have a complex against
these because these are ones that
completely overflowed on me thinks does
say on a heavier day maybe bring a
tampon or a backup I've been using
tampons for so long I kind of know
exactly how many tampons I need but when
you switch to its wholly new period
product and you don't know like how much
blood it holds the first couple of uses
are kind of troubleshooting overall I
think the think period panties are a
great supplement during product to
whatever period products you're using I
love the song and I think I'm going to
continue to use it and they're pretty
secure and comfortable to sleep in so
I'm probably going to use the hip
hundreds to sleep in as well I think
that investing in one or two of these
period panties could be really helpful I
don't think for me I'm going to go out
buy more and make like my only period
product these panties but I do think
that they have a place in the battle for
middle-earth
and when I say middle-earth I mean my
uterus thank you guys so much for
