middle it's because we dropped our
camera in the water hello friends and
welcome to another video this week we're
going to a spa theme park in Japan yes
we're going to Japan and we're also
going to a spa theme park so what
exactly is a spa theme park it's not a
super clearly defined idea but it's
basically a mash-up of a traditional
Japanese hot spring spa resort a good
old water park and a dash of PR baby
features you may have read about in like
a refinery29 article spa resorts are
actually pretty common in Japan for
thousands of years onsen or traditional
hot spring spas have been a staple of
the Japanese skincare health and
relaxation routine being a very volcanic
country Japan has a lot of naturally
occurring hot springs and where there
are hot springs there springs forth a
desire to soak in them but this
particular spa resort unasyn has taken
it to another level not only with the
waterpark aspect but with baths full of
wine
green tea coffee and fish that nibble on
your feet
amongst other things so we decided that
while we were in Japan we had to stop by
and try it out not only to get our first
full-on onsen experience but also to see
if there might be some hidden benefits
in bathing in all of these different
liquids all right let's go so our first
step in getting to the spa theme park
was to of course fly to Japan now we had
scheduled our spa day for the second day
of our trip so we were very much still
in the throes of our jetlag fever
like 36 hours the Unison spa resort is
actually located in Hakone a which is an
hour and change outside of tokyo where
we were staying so we thought it would
be fun to take a bullet train to get
there this is the footage I got from
trying to give you guys a tour of the
bullet train station which almost caused
us to miss our train clearly it was
worth it so Japanese bullet trains are
pretty well known for being one of the
fastest train systems in the world
traveling up to 200 miles an hour
you can feel how fast you're going and
with our booties thoroughly rattled we
arrived at Odawara station a quick 40
minutes later where we caught a bus that
would take us all the way to the spa
look at Tyler showing us what bus were
getting on very demonstrative walking on
Tyler I like it
unison itself is pretty high up in the
hills so the bus ride got pretty raucous
the road was winding and narrow and our
driver was quite fearless
but it was a good way to get pumped for
the spa so from the outside unison kind
of looks like a big beige hotel but it's
surrounded by some of the most beautiful
mountains that we could finally
appreciate because we weren't flying
around at the sides of them it's so
pretty out here I know the flora is on
now when you first walk into the ground
floor of unasyn you get a little taste
of their theme park branding they've
created these mascots which kind of look
like felines SpongeBob's that are
speckled throughout the park it's like
someone relaxing theme and then it's
like a grumpy cat with a beard as you
can see the entrance is just like the
hull of sponge cats so to get into the
park we had to go up a few floors passed
a series of lobbies a giant gift shop
and a number of crane toy machines until
we finally reached the actual entrance
where they immediately have you remove
your shoes what they're like you can't
take those hammer toes in here
so the park itself is broken into two
sections
one is called the more--not you or the
naked zone where men and women are
separated and one is the swimsuit adair
eeeh which is where the more water park
and more key attractions are we're going
to the naked part right now we need to
monetize that we had gotten to the park
a little early before the naked zone
opened so we could film in there by
ourselves without the aforementioned
nudity and also so Tyler could come as
well this is nice
I want a churro but don't worry we got
permission to do this over all the naked
section is more about rejuvenation and
relaxation which I think captures more
of that traditional onsen vibe obviously
I'm wearing a bathing suit for YouTube
reasons but you're supposed to get your
onsen on in the nude all right chuckling
wash off you get
no tongues so am i doing well give me s
we're sitting is we're naked people said
sometimes in the naked zone there are
about six different kinds of baths that
I could try out four of which are filled
with warm or hot plain spring water
including the first bath right at the
entrance next to the showers if you like
a talent or a do this fully wood lined
indoor pool which is almost like a sauna
because of how hot it is and it smells
really good it smells woody I don't know
how else to say that you're like piney I
don't know other wouldn't mahogany no I
don't think that this large outdoor
communal Lagoon and these personal
porcelain bowls look just like their own
like personal images it's like the
teacup ride at Disneyland the like
actually teacup
you don't get dizzy you don't throw up
you grow up on that right they do have a
couple of specialized waters back here
in The Naked zone as well though
including this green tea bath which i
think is just spring water but they
steep a rather large tea bag I'm talking
about Mountain Dews baby
in general bathing in green tea is
supposed to help your pimples and pores
and has some anti-aging benefits as well
I'm not sipping tea I am becoming tea it
they also had a summer special collagen
bath which was filled with roses ecology
besides smelling like a face mask
collagen is supposed to improve skin
elasticity and fight aging by promoting
cell turnover I did the collagen is like
counteracting the Sun it's like aging
anti aging you're really drink the
kool-aid huh well I'm trying not to
drink the cool overall I found the pools
very relaxing but the big winner of the
naked zone was the view of the mountains
and though we had ventured to unison
mostly for the more unique experiences
I'm glad we got to get a peek into the
naked zone to capture some of that
thousands of years old traditional onsen
experience and now that they're about to
open this naked zone to the public and
people will actually be making here
we're gonna head back out
and see what's out there
now when you first walk into the main
part of the spa
they have like a foot and knee rinser
which kind of took me by surprise like a
bidet for your knees one yet I do I have
not used one yet
it was Tyler's loss there are a lot of
very nice bidets in Japan now the
central chamber of the indoor section
has one giant pool in the middle of it
which I'd call like the neutral watered
communal
I'll look in there some bells look at
that but building on the onsen vibe it
has like a warm bath temperature there
my thighs hello thighs thighs out
sky's out besides that I'd say it's
pretty standard so we wanted to move on
to the more exciting waters I want to
show up my wedded chess hair to all of
you nasaan could you leave so first up
on our list of specialty pools was the
doctor fish foot baths we're a school of
garra rufa fish a variety of Turkish
toothless carp nibble or I guess vacuum
the dead skin off of your feet oh these
guys are ready for action now I've seen
this before online and it seems to be
pretty popular in many East and
Southeast Asian countries
like get your hijab
Funyuns
so basically what you do is you sit at
the edge of this tub and dangle your
feet in
like I can smell it okay take a girl and
you haven't a lot of time of 10 minutes
ready I'm ready
oh yeah some action shots yeah this
would be like shark we would fish it
Vikings up your feet the doctor fish are
incredibly tickle inducing I'm feeling
like really disheveled
some of them sort of traverse your whole
leg and others just pick a spot and go
at it they really like my feet I think
that's not a compliment in a particular
Tyler's right foot had a disturbing
number of fish on it might be versus on
speed but before his foot could be
consumed entirely or ten minutes were up
Friday yes I actually do think that the
fish got some of the dead skin off of my
toes but I probably would have had a
more thorough pedicure had Tyler not
been hogging all of the carp there's
like not dead skin on my feet right now
they're chunks too not when we're in a
little like creeper so unison has like a
schedule of events and at specific times
they will pour coffee and red wine
directly on to you in their respective
pools and we had a bit of time before
the next coffee pour began so we went to
check out some of the smaller themed
pools next door the green tea and the
Saki bats you're not supposed to drink
the sake or the green tea I say that to
me so we went to the green tea bath
first which was pretty different from
the green tea pool outside oh really
that one was just like normal spring
water with a green tea bag and this was
like a scalding cup of tea I'm guessing
they mixed this one with something else
or just like diluted in a bit but in
general the tea was just too hot for me
hey Soph
yeah you've spilt tea everywhere so
having mildly boiled the booty we then
hopped over to the Saki bath which was
noticeably a much better temperature
well I like this that's nice I like the
ones that are like warm but not like too
too hot
sensitive five sake could be good for
the skin and meta can help exfoliate and
lighten dark spots and bathing in it is
actually a traditional geisha skincare
secret on the side of the bath was sort
of like a giant sock a drum but I think
the liquid in the bath was pretty
diluted from the smell and feel of it I
don't know that you could like get plum
in here because there are a bunch of
kids in here earlier
though on the side of the barrel was a
true sake spigot so apparently this
little knob here shoots out a little
sake and
drinkable
I'm gonna get sir
shoot me the face you're not usually
supposed to drink the Sakae straight out
of this nozzle but the Unison employees
who are escorting us around encouraged
us to try it
don't photoshop this you get a little
bit put your hands out there so you can
catch it there we go yeah here's my sake
Baptiste
yeah yeah that's good sake but after our
sake taste test it was time for the
coffee bath you almost fell it at the
camera I'm hammered the coffee bath
itself is just kind of like very watery
coffee though it does smell and look
pretty accurately coffee ish in terms of
its skin benefits there are some
antioxidants in coffee that can help
detox your skin and the caffeine
actually combats puffiness and I feel
like also just gets into your pores and
wakes you up you know I don't know
there's recibo or what but as soon as I
walked in here I was like eight
let's go the big event at the coffee
bath is the coffee pour and what happens
is that they prepare actual drinkable
coffee in these giant buckets and men
dole it out to the crowd
there's monster ladies
Oh yours was a drink it I just threw it
on my face no it was good so I tried to
co-opt some of Tyler's portion for
drinking purposes
actually and after a decent amount of
the crowd had tasted the coffee they
then proceeded to throw entire buckets
directly at us
it's good it's very tasty they did this
quite a few times
I'm not sure if the skin benefits are
amplified by the coffee being thrown at
you but it is exciting
idea what kind of footage
and I did feel pretty awake afterwards
so the final unusual bath that we wanted
to try was the wine back which had
another pour type event later that
afternoon so we decided to visit the
outdoor portion of the park in the
meantime on the way we passed a few
additional pools that looked pretty
plain but it turns out that this was the
location of the ramen baths which were a
pretty popular attraction last year in
which park goers bathed in pork broth
and collagen I'm kind of salty we missed
it
so the outside of the park has some of
your usual waterpark accoutrement like
slides and kiddie pools and waterfalls
with the added bonus that the view is
pretty freakin ridiculous
we four went to the children's area for
the waterslide
I got a behavior rinse off because I
really smell like coffee can you see it
yes I can amongst my hairs it's like
coffee stuck in your mustache on your
shoulders unfortunately they didn't let
us take our GoPros onto the slide but I
guess that did spare everyone from
having to watch a very slow water slide
shot which I think was just our problem
because other people were going down
much faster but nonetheless we do have a
second angle on this shot if you want to
see it following the slide we went
through like a hot springs grotto which
was mostly just a series of shallow
pools but you could see the waterfall
from behind as well as this gemstone
thing that they call a Marin rose but
from there you can walk through to
behind the waterslide where the
observation pools are coming these are
basically like a series of long skinny
pools alright and once again a warm pool
very warm that oversee the mountains as
well as unison itself down there is
Tyler and then there is the spa resort
the view kind of made the observation
pools my favorite part of the park but
after bobbing around a bit and film
like 50,000 pans of the surrounding
landscape
we had to head back inside
just like
you know I love these kids are getting
wasted Tyler kept making that joke as
for the skin benefits of red wine it's
got some antioxidants for some
anti-aging and also some antiseptic
properties for some anti acne
I thoroughly enjoyed the red wine pool
though it did seem to be the most
diluted of the specialty pools for
example this giant wine bottle that
spraying my head is completely just
water but for the wine pour itself
they went for the real deal like with
the coffee
they started off by pouring some red
wine into your hands which by wine
standards was a pretty decent amount
unlike Tyler who chugged it I
voluntarily threw it in my face hoping
for some quality anti-aging then they
proceeded with a more direct port which
I think Tyler thought he was supposed to
chug again it hit him pretty quick they
concluded the show with another round of
throwing a full bucket directly into our
face
with the wine bath complete I think we
had actually hit all of the specialty
pools so we threw on some complimentary
scrubs and slippers and got something to
eat all right hi what's up next we're
getting Buffy now lunch dude grab and
then we'll run their buffet had a pretty
good spread and was a nice cap on top of
all of that soaking and afterwards we
caught the tail end of a park-wide aqua
workout class so after 11 baths lunch
and a workout I think we had thoroughly
investigated our spa theme park and were
ready to head back to Tokyo how do I go
yeah let's go it was really fun so we
caught our bus back down the mountain
hopped on another bullet train which you
can really see the speed of here
but that's the best right and needless
to say we were home in a speedy 40
minutes well from the train station of
course alright so we are back at our
hotel room now and I'm feeling pretty
cooked we had a great time at the Unison
spa resort but I feel like I've just
been steeped for so long in so many
different types of liquids that I just
need a nap overall our experience at the
spa theme park was very positive though
I think the things I thought were the
most exciting before I went were not
actually my favorite parts I thoroughly
enjoyed the quieter parts of the park
like the naked zone and literally all of
the amazing views of the mountains one
thing I thoroughly enjoyed which we
didn't include very much in the main
part of the video were the mascots I
like this one cuz it looks like he has
cheese on his head but they were kind of
cute Lee speckled all over the park
subtly this sneaky guy
look at him so sneaky and not so subtly
say and Rio is quaking is that still a
mean I think that after this trip we did
feel sufficiently spod whatever happened
to Sponge Bob that cured him of the suds
I think happened to us yeah I mean I
think that we do feel softer and I think
there was a logic behind each pool as to
why they would be good for your skin I
think that we soaked in so many things
that we're not going to be able to
pinpoint like if our skin is better like
which one it was yeah helped us but it's
sort of like the cumulative experience
of just like you know sort of rolling
around in hot water and feeling good and
tired it was quite a trek so it'll be
difficult for us to return but if you're
down for about 15 hours of travel we'd
say it's worth the trip or also if
you're in Japan already maybe that would
be good thank you guys so much for
