video today I'm going to be wearing a
head-to-toe clear plastic outfit that's
right today I'm going to achieve my goal
of becoming a prepackaged hot dog now
you may not have known that that was a
goal of mine and to be honest I didn't
know that that was a goal of mine until
I started that sentence so I've worn
clear plastic pants for a week before
and after that I thought I was done with
clear plastic clothing but apparently
retailers and the internet are not done
with clear plastic clothing because
since I made that video I have seen so
many other clear plastic clothes because
apparently they think people want this
so I ordered a ton of clear plastic
clothing and we're going to be wearing
it all today quick note I will not be
wearing the clear plastic pants with
this outfit I will say that after my
week wearing them I did develop an
affinity for them despite the noise and
also the butt and crotch condensation
but they're not clear plastic anymore
what happened to them it's unclear if
anyone knows how to clean them please
let me know alright let's bring on the
clear plastic oh oh there it is oh oh
there she blows okay we're gonna be
taking this out on the town today seeing
how it feels to wear an entire outfit of
clear plastic clothes and also what
people think of taking this clear
plastic trend to the extreme look at
that good noise this is the noise that
you want your body to be making let's go
put it on oh my god what I am queen of
saran wrap what it's very hot out today
nervous about the jackets but I'm into
the bralette like the choker the choker
is actually taped in the back because
this choker was too small for me unlike
like a leather or cloth or Tatsu choker
which will stretch this one was just
like strangulation device wow that's
gonna be brutal take off I decided to
wear like a nude slip dress under all
this I decided against full nip but I
will provide the illusion of nudity from
very far away you're making a lot of
noise already this is like more noise
from different locations at even like
different classic pitches yeah it's like
an orchestra yeah so last time that I
wore a plastic item crusty did not like
it so let's see what crusty does this
time do you not like it
sometimes we torture him for videos yeah
you okay he's fine he'd like to get that
he's fine with me he just like tile you
need to stop socializing with her she
it's the stuff working clear plastic
stuff all right so we're gonna head out
and get some opinions on what people
really think of this clear plastic trend
when it's taken to the extreme he's
still not cool with it
yeah you go back to sleep crusty okay
I'll take the bag lady out of here so
when we first started off I was feeling
a little squeaky and a little stiff and
I thought my plastic just needed to be
warmed up a little bit so we headed to
somewhere that I thought would be sunny
and warm Santa Monica I really love
these sunglasses honestly they do not
however really block out the Sun
or do much of anything really they're
basically just like clear plastic lenses
they're like hipster glasses when we
arrived I noticed that my skirt was
pretty wrinkled from sitting down in the
car it'll fix itself right yeah but
besides that I was ready to take on the
world
Santa Monica is somewhat of a tourist
destination so I think I ended up being
a little bit of a spectacle we just
walked out of the garage complex and I
saw a couple of girls like an emu like
like maybe they're wondering like is
this what people from LA just wear or do
but also like am i a street performer or
am I like going to attack them in some
way so I definitely got some like
somewhat negative like are you crazy
attention but I'm really just trying to
find a good spot to Instagram and take
the choker off so
one early casualty of the day was the
choker I can breathe but I can't really
turn my head I'm seeing a little bit of
a fish yeah we got to get that thing off
don't do that your scissors so I don't
remember buying like a small size or
anything but when I got it it was super
super small for my neck it's so red yeah
it's time for this thing to go yeah so
the choker pretty much had to go oh I'm
free
whoa that took a couple of my neck hairs
with it not as much as I thought it
might that was gonna be a cool wax job
in fact I think it had reached literal
choking hazard level was worth it no but
besides the choker everything else was
more comfortable than I was expecting I
was expecting a lot of sweat and
friction and just general condensation
and there was not nearly as much of that
as there was last time I think because
the skirt was more open air and the
crotch was less contained less noisy
than the clear plastic guards that that
loud it's not that loud I think the
skirt was a great decision
the only issue was that as the plastic
was new it was a little bit slippery I
would be a hazard at a child's pool
party
slip and slide it was like extra you
would beat this lipid slide I oh yeah
that's what I am I'm just a lie down and
small children would just just getting
weird we're just gonna cut that where we
are yeah there was definitely some sweat
in the underarms and there was also some
condensation in the shoes there's a
little bit of mist right the tah yeah
you're right but besides that I was
actually doing pretty well so I was
pretty comfortable but other people were
pretty uncomfortable so for some reason
the clear plastic always gets the
biggest reactions like this clear
plastic pants clear plastic fist my
clothes may be invisible but like I am
NOT like people are like what's up are
you - I think it may be the aluminum
nudity people get excited so beyond just
general like street first impressions I
wanted to get some people's opinions on
my outfit alright so I'm here with
Johnny
this upset
reconsider your life
so once you realized I wasn't naked what
was your first thought
most people thought that the plastic was
kind of cool in its own way even if it
wasn't something that they would wear
would you guys wear anything
you would yeah
like
not we're like
but one brave taker said that she would
wear the entire thing at the same time
would you hire all of it together
so if you still want it after I've
sweatin it for about 12 hours just let
me know so after talking to some people
in person I also wanted to see what you
guys thought on the Instagram all right
let's do it we'll see what happens
I feel like they were mixed reviews
there were so negative this dress ruined
my day it's stupid you look like a fish
in a plastic bag and actually a decent
amount of positive reviews as well
low-key loving this why does this not
annoy me I'm confused
if they make a fourth Zenon movie this
will be her primary costume that is the
best compliment that I've ever received
one thing I noticed from the Instagram
comments and the reactions in real life
was that people thought that it looked
futuristic kind of like a high-fashion
ziplock bag of the Year 2035 nowadays
clear plastic clothing may be sold by
trendy retailers like forever 21 Dolls
kill and Topshop found them but plastic
clothes started off as experimental high
fashion
as we've talked about before designers
in the 1960s made concept clothing out
of plastic as well as other inorganic
materials used by astronauts as the
space race took center stage and
interest in the Future group do you like
these ones better than mine
no I like yours clear plastic clothing
also had another stint in the 90s oh
there it is
found it when shear clothing came into
fashion and people really loved showing
off their undergarments it seems in some
ways that clear plastic may just be the
futuristic Full Monty version of the
sheer clothing trend he got kicked out
of forever 21 to go we could complete
our search but you know we found a
couple of clear plastic things out in
the wild a lot of it lives online I
think a lot of it's like we'll just put
this on our website in case anyone wants
and but they're like not sure if they
want to like market
on Santa Monica promenade quite yet like
astronaut and space travel materials
this outfit is very resistant to the
elements so one thing about wearing
clear plastic is as I realized last time
it can seep guard against food stains so
you can just you know kind of do it
everyone may be as messy of an eater as
you will
Oh
tonight mr. tested it out that was so
close to not where my plastic was that
said my slip underneath was pretty high
and dry the only thing that was really
left to do was to clean the plastic
clothes which you can do in a variety of
different ways so I'm gonna go rinse off
somehow somewhere I don't know where I
had taken my clear pants into the pool
which may have led to their death but I
wanted to try out something a little
more natural this time should we try and
find a water source of some kind I think
I see one but Yetta you're going to the
ocean don't tell them that yet
so I went straight into the Pacific
Ocean well not straight I put on a
bathing suit and then we went straight
into the ocean I'm ready let's get in
the water yes I know that I could have
easily taken this off and rinsed it
wifed it maybe with a baby wipe or
something but instead we're just gonna
walk straight into the ocean and
hopefully not ruin all of our clear
plastic stuff in the process the only
thing I was worried about besides the
potential clouding or salting of the
clothes was that something would fall
off and become like a pollution hazard
for the ocean so when you're doing that
you kind of just got to keep your wits
about you like make sure nothing just
falls off you don't want to be an enemy
to see wildlife are you renting yourself
off
are you clean
I'm gonna rinse off now to actually
hopefully not cloud up this plastic
forever yeah you're gonna smell like
seawater and clear plastic in do
I saw some public showers over there you
guys know I love public showers in the
public showers we're loving this outfit
I like it a lot right even right now
yeah
even soaking wet this
okay so I'm clean now I'm very wet so I
think it's time to head back now
give these clothes a proper rinse so
they don't actually cloud up like the
clear plastic pants then
so after I dried off we went to
Universal CityWalk to grab some dinner I
feel like after the dip the plastic cold
stickier and ring cleared but
it's clean now so that's all that
matters very good I think the clear
plastic outfit really shines at night
but it kind of reflects light too off of
itself and you look less naked and a
little more like static electricity near
neon sign good place to be why am I out
here with you
I've dinner I did have the unfortunate
experience of getting stuck to the booth
I'm never know
all right we're done with dinner come
get me are you serious do that stuff oh
wait wait wait wait that can't slide out
I feel like myself
but besides that it was a good time and
I actually ended up buying the
restaurant postcard I don't think this
was money well-spent but now we have
this so that was my day in clear plastic
clothing with my second time around and
plastic clothes I've reached a
conclusion that I don't hate this stuff
I think it does look kind of cool in
certain situations but I don't think
it's ever gonna catch on to be like a
true widespread trend besides maybe like
pictures or online or that kind of thing
it's just not quite comfortable enough I
think in the future we'll actually
probably be wearing things are like very
ergonomic and less like plastic things
that will stick to booths I wore this
nude slip underneath everything just so
I could show the plastic clothes off in
all their glory but I think that this
outfit would actually look good with
other stuff underneath so I think I'll
definitely experiment with this with
like other stuff underneath it
maybe not the entire outfit at the same
time but like a couple pieces here and
there but if you do wear it is
everything
you would be prepared for any impromptu
water fights
my faces are dry but my dress sure is
