video this week we're gonna be taking on
another questionable clothing item
platform crux yes I said platform and
yes I said crux I said a platform crux
we were first made aware of this item in
October of last year when Balenciaga
sent them down the runway for their
spring and summer 2018 collection and
needless to say many a headline writer
was shook Balenciaga is trolling us all
with these 10 inch platform Crocs these
platform Crocs from Balenciaga will tear
your feelings apart let's stop
pretending Balenciaga Zameen bait is
cool regardless of how you feel about
Crocs I don't think anyone for saw them
in an $850 platform version sashaying
down a runway what had happened now at
first they weren't available because
they were supposed to come out in spring
of this year and then when they came out
for pre-order they sold out almost
instantaneously but after months of
waiting they're finally here and it's
time to try them on and see if they are
ridiculous or fashionable for my guests
ridiculously fashionable alright let's
bring them out oh wow they're a lot
heavier than I thought it would be oh my
god I'm so confused alright so it looks
like I've got a letter is my receipt
don't want to look at that no and here
are the Crocs tada
oh my god they're tall actually they're
sort of smaller than I would have
thought online they seemed like very
very very large but this seems like a
sort of classic Spice Girl level
platform so these are definitely heavier
than like normal Crocs which are quite
light there are a lot of cute little
charms on here what are they called
widgets
gibbehhhhh's Gibbons it looks like
they're kind of going for like a jet
setter like passport theme we've got
like Paris Berlin and then on this other
shoe we've got a peace sign a pug and an
avocado they definitely like a make a
statement they look like a piece of
bubble gum has
not been stuck to your shoe but has
eaten your shoe they seem sort of
difficult to style or to like wear
things with so this week will be an
interesting challenge
did I make you phlegm a little bit yeah
oh wow yes or giant right now I am very
tall in these and in fact like I think
that if these were any taller I would
die so I don't know what I was thinking
my first impression that how easy these
things are to wear is that they're not
they feel comfortable on my feet but
when I pick up my foot to try and walk I
feel like Bride of Frankenstein Barbie
I'm just worried about falling off of
them like timber and that's how Regina
George died that day
that would be how I died well I think we
should begin our journey we should walk
at least a mile cumulatively over the
next week in these shoes good luck
that's not that far so one day one I
wanted to style night platform Crocs the
same way that Balenciaga styled them on
the runway so I wore like a black maxi
dress with a white long-sleeved shirt
underneath plain makeup and large
earrings any fashion wellness that you
might have immediately is lost as you
try to walk now I'm not gonna speak for
Balenciaga and heaven knows they
wouldn't want me to but I kind of felt
like a kid playing dress-up in this
outfit my sleeves are long my dress is
long my shoes are giant you know like
when you have your mom's high heels on
your life almost like in Angelica from
Rugrats moment which I feel like sort of
capitalizes on the youthful feel of
Crocs isn't fashion obsessed with youth
why not go for that six year old chic is
it here runway walk yeah this team
so I decided that I should take the
crocks home to the Balenciaga store in
Beverly Hills
I'm not fancy now I never will be do you
think that the store calls to them like
the ocean calls Moana a place that I had
never been before but these shoes
certainly had I will say that the Crocs
were not the only strange thing inside
of that Balenciaga store tie look at
these they're pants
stiletto boots yeah it's doing why
despite the price tag of these shoes I'm
not sure that I really fit in with the
whole Beverly Hills vibe it's different
than wearing like an $800 stiletto shoe
it's like this is an $800 croc clog so I
was questionably fancy but
unquestionably unstable I had to lean on
Tyler for support I'm a glorified King
right now and I barely made it over a
speed bump in the parking lot speed bump
or cars or for Sophia's
so one day - I wanted to attempt to wear
the Crocs with an outfit that I would
normally wear I feel like in general
Crocs are usually like a I'll just grab
my Crocs type of shoes going out the
door to an outdoor activity grocery
shopping this is my on the ghost dance
that's on the go I think that my
stability while walking was slowly
improving not winning any speed Awards
here not breaking ankle I discovered
that you can kind of like walk around on
the tips of the Crocs and that is
somehow more stable it's like a point
shoe in ballet
I feel more agile watch out I'm gonna
get there eventually though I wouldn't
say I was trying to blend in I wouldn't
say my outfit was more on the muted side
but I think the Crocs were just
upstaging everything else that was going
on so I don't think that this like
casual look really works you kind of
have to like bring it up here to really
match what's going on down there they
were large and in charge and being in
charge they decided to take me to the
Crocs store to show themselves off to
the other crops they're not ready for
this jelly I think inside of the store
they really did assert their dominance I
think that's about as tall as my crop
twice the size but the styling of them
most closely resembles the tiniest of
Crocs that are marketed to toddlers at
the end of the day I'm not sure who
really bested who because it did leave
the store having bought many items I got
dogs and widgets and props shine
Jib 'it's jiff it sorry I'm a big man so
for my third outfit I tried something a
little different
yesterday's outfit was like a little bit
plain on top so I decided to try and up
the ante a little bit on the upper body
I went for more of like a raver look
though I'm not sure you would really
want to wear this to a rave or if you
did you might want to be stationary
because any sort of like hopping or
dancing might cause you to topple I
think one thing I underestimated about
this outfit was how high and exposed my
booty would be or like close to being
exposed
I think that in some ways this outfit
was more balanced like it felt less like
the shoes were in charge but I think
that I was more eye-catching in general
so more people kind of like did a
double-take
and then looked down and were like oh
those I'm not the best outfit for
jaywalking it if I were ever to get a
ticket it would be in this out yes you
are six and a half feet tall and you are
breaking the law so after getting a
chance to style these shoes I was kind
of starting to like them but clearly a
lot of people online did not so I'm
actually gonna Instagram a photo of this
look and see what you guys think cuz
obviously like headline writers were
but I wonder how y'all as individuals
feel I would say that your guys's
comments kind of fall into three
categories the first which is upset
what's hellfire of a video is this for
the lord has abandoned us the second
category being confused and conflicted
the fact that I don't hate these is
causing me tremendous mental distress I
hate myself for not hating them and in
the third category which is beyond
liking them and in fact planning to wear
them in important situations you need
these for the club found your prom shoes
catch me wearing these at my wedding
though I do sort of doubt that you guys
are actually gonna go out and buy these
I think that a majority of the comments
were actually positive or at least like
surprisingly okay with them so maybe
some of those articles we're just being
shook ahthe for sugar sake oh my God
look at my little toe nail sticking out
I didn't notice this Wow maybe put a
divot right there so for my fourth
outfit I wanted to go for kind of like a
retro platform look so I went for this
like late 90s early 2000s vibe it was
also very pink I think because the Crocs
were demanding some matching clothing
it's like your shoes have possessed you
yes I am the shoe today nice to meet you
my name is Valencia are you affordable
never know so when I think of platform
shoes the first thing that comes to mind
is baby spice of the Spice Girls you can
call me Harry Spice when I think of
Crocs the first thing that springs into
my mind is my brother gardening in 2006
but there has to be more to it so I
thought that diving into the history
behind both of these shoes might shed
some light on our current situation as
for Crocs the first pairs were produced
for the 2002 Fort Lauderdale goats show
marketed as the perfect boating shoe
from then on Crocs had a serious moment
in the mid-2000s becoming the
fastest-growing shoe company in 2006
that's not to say we thought they were
fashionable back then I think it was
more of a collective decision to say
screw it these are comfortable and I'm
going
to wear them since then they've remained
a go-to lightweight shoe that you can
throw on to check your mail walk around
your yard go to the grocery store but
they haven't as of yet broken through
the style barrier unlike crocks
platforms shoes have been in and out of
style since pretty much 600 BC when
Greek actors used them in clays to make
themselves more visible during the
hainan period in Japan platform shoes
originated as a way for rice farmers to
avoid sinking into the mud but over time
were adopted by geishas and Iran as a
way to both stop their kimonos from
dragging on the ground but also as a way
to signal their status wealth and
profession the thing is my skirt is very
short so I don't need help like keeping
my clothes off of the ground but I am in
fact elevating my outfit for all to see
yep they're coming they've come to take
my crocks away with an axe across the
world in medieval Europe platform shoes
were also prevalent mostly amongst fancy
folk who used them both to tower above
commoners and also to avoid sinking into
the mud and literal poop on the streets
I don't think Balenciaga meant this but
like the original use case of platforms
and the original use case of Crocs are
somewhat similar like they're both used
like wade through mud so putting them
both into one shoe kind of makes more
sense than I originally thought in more
recent history platforms came back into
style in the 30s during the Great
Depression as the cork used for their
soles was cheaper than traditional
materials and from then on they were
popular with actresses in the 40s glam
rockers in the 70s and an interesting
combination of the Spice Girls and
Gotham punk subcultures in the 90s as
for this outfit I did enjoy the 90s
vibes but I think all the pink was a bit
much for me I think I'm gonna need to
watch a horror movie
for this outfit or at least like
marathon The Addams Family so after
learning some history and doing some
styling I wanted to put these shoes
through some practicality tests so we're
gonna head down to Disneyland tonight
and wear these around all evening and
see what happens
and if I break an ankle I think I am
getting better at walking around in
these shoes so I think that also makes
me cockier which makes me fall more
there was so much arrogance before were
too close to the Sun but after a few
hours of being on my feet I think the
main hindrance was the exhaustion
onwards ever onwards on the inexorable
march towards day I think there's just
more effort required when wearing this
type of platform that's not really like
strapped to your feet the way like a
sneaker is pick up so eventually my feet
needed to be stretched out every few
minutes or so and though I wasn't
getting like blisters I was actually
hurting a little bit
I thought my calves feel when I got a
good stretch besides that I did enjoy
being very tall at Disneyland
no one told me I was too tall for any of
the rides and I was just high tea enough
to touch the Magic Castle see I could
touch the portcullis I was sure you're
gonna keep that solon day six I wanted
to take my platform Crocs to the water
so although I personally say Crocs do
well in like muddy situations
Tyler insists that one wears Crocs to
the beach look what I did not expect was
how hard it would be to get to the water
I cannot stand up straight for the life
my crocs are sinking didn't do the safer
since walking slowly wasn't getting me
anywhere
I decided to make a mad dash for it it's
a it was not working are you ok I'm
totally fine you said it would be good
on the beach once we got to the harder
sand though things started looking up
but now let's see what the ocean does
I started lifting my foot up while there
was water underneath me and my foot
started floating away was that me like a
giant flotation device attached to it so
since Tyler had made us come to the
beach
I made him try on the Crocs
Oh be careful die it's me versus beside
it don't bait him maybe Tyler does have
better balance than me or maybe not and
he was right that the Crocs can be
easily rinsed off but with the
unevenness of the sand and the height of
the platform I would not recommend
wearing these shoes to the beach No so
for our last outfit I wanted to go full
wild and out head-to-toe questionable
fashion decision damn oh this is like a
rap video now that we have done quite a
few of these videos I do have like a lot
of ugly clothes to choose from so I
chose a classic the band ruffle t-shirt
and also a never-before-seen item the
hoodie sweatpants
these pants are absolutely ridiculous
yes they're almost almost outshining the
shoes I bought them to make a video out
of but we never did so here they are
this is kind of like what I imagined
clothing in the future will be
got nowhere else to go but ugly whenever
I wear a full outfit of so-called ugly
items I'm always curious as to which one
will be the worst and I don't think the
Crocs were the worst the Crocs were like
how did I get so normal all of a sudden
even if the Crocs were relatively tame
the whole outfit did make me look kind
of like an avant-garde killer clown I
kind of feel dangerous like it's 10 p.m.
at Target and I'm here
to be honest I'm surprised they even let
me in the store I feel like I could be a
meme you know instead of the Walmart
yodeling boy I could be the target
platform crocks girl I would accept that
moniker that's a pretty good name don't
mind a hoodie pants ya know I don't know
about these okay so that was my week of
wearing platform Crocs overall what's
the initial shock wore off the fashion
of them wasn't too bad and I did
actually get a fair amount of
compliments in person I think that any
of the pushback to the style of these
shoes comes from that like stigma around
Crocs and not really from their actual
appearance that said they are very
impractical they are waterproof and made
of foam but they're not very comfortable
to walk around in especially for like
long amounts of time and they're very
easy to fall off of you also can't
style-wise just like grab these shoes
and go like I feel like you really have
to plan your outfit ahead of time all in
all in terms of the existence of these
shoes I'm of two minds I enjoy how crazy
and irreverent they are and I do like
the idea that Balenciaga is trolling
people who might not like Crocs by like
making them fashion but I also don't
love the idea of taking an accessible
shoe that millions of people wear and
love and turning it into a luxury item
I feel like platform Crocs should be
marketed to people who like Crocs not
just people who can afford the crazy
price tag and might be wearing them
ironically not that anyone really needs
these but it does seem like some people
might want to wear them to their wedding
to which I'll say if you will actually
get married in these and you are a size
10 women's I will send them to you thank
