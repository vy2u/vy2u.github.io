video this week we're gonna be taking on
another strange fashion item and this
time it's a jacket previously we've
tried the Teva Uggs
the clear knee mom jeans that one banned
ruffle t-shirt the clear pants and the
hairy chest swimsuit it's fall it seems
appropriate that a jacket would pop up
right about now and oh it has so I found
this jacket on my Twitter feed and I
thought it was pretty much one of the
strangest things that I'd ever seen I
then found out that it was $700 which
didn't make me happy but I thought we
had to try it anyway and maybe if we can
get through the week without ruining it
we can return it at the end
now this jacket is from a company called
wide project there are also the
originators of the diaper jeans the
double jeans I believe and I'm sure a
couple other ones they're just having a
good time designing things that nobody
wants but everyone wants to talk about
so besides Twitter other news outlets
have also picked up this jacket a little
bit here's the denim jacket with sleeves
that reach your knees that you've always
wanted you didn't need to use your hands
do you is this the world's dumbest
fashion statement perhaps okay let's
bring it out all right here it is looks
normal
looks normal but wait wait oh my god
I don't think I can show you guys what
it looks like actually sitting down I
think I got a hold it up well I have
some concerns right off the bat mostly
I'm just nervous about using my hands
also maybe dragging on the ground
getting it dirty people literally
thinking I'm Slenderman but I'm honestly
kind of excited there's a lot of arm
there's a lot of arm
I will say that I already can't use my
hands I noticed that my fly was like
slightly unzipped in the bat game over
yeah I thought about it and I couldn't
do anything about it like my hands are
here by the way I don't know about
wearing it all week like trying to
actually do things because it feels like
actually these could almost be hazards
in terms of like hitting people or maybe
getting caught in car doors yeah you're
gonna get dragged I feel dramatic or I
feel a little bit like a rhythmic
gymnast around like on ribbons I also
kind of feel like my own like personal
space designator I'm just like don't
come near me I mean to be honest I don't
get it
but it is kind of fun all right let's do
it
trying to get thumbs up so day one I
tried to style the jacket as closely to
the pictures on the net-a-porter website
as I could
can you reach me from here they had
basically a matching pair of wide leg
jeans and a white button-down and like
white boots on and I actually found a
pair of jeans that pretty closely
matches this denim but it's not really
wide leg in fact it's quite skinny I do
like the idea
my pants look like my sleeves they have
photos of the sleeves long and also
scrunched up I think it's crunch it up
it just feels like I'm not committing I
mean like I need to commit but I think
its natural state is when it's like
completely unfurled like a shady
character I would not want to run into
you in this alley
there's definitely something fun about
it but your hands do turn into giant
blubbering mittens so that's just
something to think about before you try
and do anything or pick anything up
again sanitizer don't need that I got
giant Afton's on your hand see this is a
way to enjoy both the jacket and your
hands at the same time almost like a
cape you feel kind of like Anna Wintour
get me Naga food yeah it is a little
Devil Wears Prada don't you know
everything UN has been picked by us and
this is all day two I wore the jacket
with a grey wide-leg jumpsuit which
ended up being pretty much the same
length as the sleeves of the jacket so
it was almost like I was just wearing
like one block of clothes and kind of
like trying to like pass a high school
dress code like my skirt has to be
longer than my
we went out to dinner in the jacket
which made me a little nervous because
food definitely seems like enemy number
one in the quest to return this I can
use my jacket like an oven mitt
can you see that's amazing I'm holding
my hot plate just
and I gotta eat it though that's the
next challenge but actually pizza was
kind of okay oh maybe I don't need
Tyler's hello I had a little more
control than I anticipated over like the
pin singh action I'm able to kind of
like the clasp insert with my thumb
can't use much of my thumb and knees but
a little bit at the phone strangely I
would say that eating with the sleeves
pushed up made me more anxious because I
was nervous that the sleeves would
unfurl into the food was it your hair
like when you leaned down into it no
what's that
another potential hazard is escalators
you got clearance be careful get your
jacket stuck in the actual escalator
universally - leave the job
then you think about all that money in
general I would say there are more
snagging hazards and one would
anticipate you just got to be careful
out there a straitjacket of the names
that we have - it would have to be one
of the dumbest ways you could die I
always get sucked in yeah that would be
one of the secrets I'm filming somebody
wear that jacket so day three I went for
a more casual recreational look I took
the jacket to see a friend
which direction he goes
it's hard work also
like oh you're a new worker nice
cinnamon walked away
that's pretty tough work to be honest
yeah no I I don't envy him he does
however have like a full cylindrical
tubular body I only have sleeves I'm not
saying that I'm good enough to be hired
but I'm definitely good enough to do it
for free so while I'm still training I
thought I'd do some pro bono work
outside of some you know dealerships
that need some help in general though if
you don't have to do anything specific
like eat or be perceived as a normal
human this jackets pretty amusing that's
not enough sleeves that it's not good
enough it's kind of like a sexless adult
toy I'm Edward denim hands just hours of
fun by yourself I do have a fun little
dramatic flair I'm dangerous day four is
when tragedy struck I went online to see
the net-a-porter listing for this jacket
just to make sure I didn't miss anything
and I saw that they changed their
marketing photos to feature only the
jacket with those sleeves scrunched up
or fold it up like inside out there were
no longer any photos of it oh natural so
even though it killed me I decided to
style it like they recommended and
folded the sleeves inside out to curb
its natural enthusiasm
I would rather roll them up like I've
kind of been doing like you know push
them up for with the scrunching you can
so reveal the sleeve you can unfold
we're so far from the sleeve right now I
feel like if you bought this jacket from
their photos expecting it to be almost
like a two-tone denim jacket and you got
this you would be shocked I don't think
that it was ever worth $700 but without
the sleeves it's definitely not worth
$700 at least with this I get like two
extra feet of denim to smack with
why I was honestly surprised that they
bailed on their long sleeve so quickly I
think it's because they got so much crap
for the jacket they started trying to
sell it as something more normal on the
website they state that why project is
going for an exaggerated oversized
silhouette which has been featured on
high fashion runways over the last
couple of years but the question of why
still remains I have a few of my own
theories there is something about the
sleeves that make me feel like a little
girl or like I'm wearing something like
super oversized like my boyfriend's
jacket you know it's just so big on me
but impractically exaggerated
silhouettes have popped up at different
times throughout history usually took a
note social status for example in 18th
century France extravagantly wide hips
dresses called penny airs were worn to
show how much fabric and tailoring the
wearer could afford and their difficulty
to walk in also demonstrated the
wearer's lack of need to be mobile
another example from the other side of
the world comes from China where
exceptionally long pinky fingernails
were grown by nobility to show that the
wearer's hands were too fancy for manual
labour whether or not this jacket is
meant to have a similar connotation is
unclear I'm not sure this denim look
shouts fancy in today's world what I
will say is that what it lacks in
practicality it certainly makes up for
with fun but it needs that exaggerated
silhouette and sleeves unfurled to do it
so sorry net-a-porter but then folded up
looking flying with me day five
I left the jacket back out of the bag
and I took it on a little makeup
excursion to Disneyland I'm actually
pretty sure I can reach the water in
snowy
well oh did you pee that in general it
was really fun it was nighttime so I
don't think anyone was really giving my
jacket a second look you know part of
being at Disneyland is like people are
kind of like wearing marks you know like
they're like wearing their character
stuff so like could be like oh what
character are you Ursula's Ilsa
Oh same I was interested to see though
how the jacket would do on a roller
coaster so we went on Splash Mountain to
be honest I was like kind of nervous
about that but we survived the jacket
survived and for the first time in my
life I bought ride photo at Disney I
like it cuz I kind of put my arms up a
little too late for the pictures the
ends have become all flaccid and my
return tag is so long
thankfully there weren't that many
people at the park so we had a log all
to ourselves and we also had a lot of
the park to ourselves yeah full radius
that thing we're gonna abandon
Disneyland for life you know I know
they've banned selfie sticks from
Disneyland I feel like they're gonna now
fan this jacket specific the one jacket
it honestly went pretty well with the
happiest place on earth vibe
I'm engaging my core except for the
moment when I thought I would be stuff
on the carousel forever day six I took
my jacket to a more formal situation I
tried to kind of dress it up you know I
was saying like what can you wear with
this Slenderman jacket to dress it up
and I was like giant pants it's the
double negative outfit exactly it's like
which one's worse we met up with
Christine and Ben from simply illogical
at a like pre streamys event she sees us
I don't think she's ready for this
we're shaking hands you can't leave
it's like a Chinese finger trap
Christine and Ben actually didn't seem
to mind the jacket that much what do you
think of it then
by a man and in general I would say that
the event was a pretty good place for
the jacket these were made for the red
carpets off
there were a lot of dancing
opportunities which besides outside of a
used car lot I hadn't done much of this
week it's like a rave shirt if I ever
get invited to raves
I shall wear it in fact I think the
dance floor might see this jackets true
natural habitat you just have to make
sure that nobody else really also wants
to dance because you need some room
I don't know if anyone was looking I was
more involved in like dancing I was
doing a lot of buzz yeah they were
looking away so I don't know how other
people were reacting to be honest
Christina and Ben were less weirded out
than I thought they would be
I don't know if it's worth $700 but I'm
gonna have a hard time parting it so on
day seven
I wore this so-called ugly jacket with a
selection of my other so-called
ugly items I haven't worn some of these
in a while I'm kind of feeling some
familiar caresses of my body you know
they know my curves when your sleeves
are down it draws your attention
downward and then you see the community
of mom jeans and then you see the
ugliest shoes it's just like the outfit
that keeps on giving
there is something very liberating about
looking like an idiot I feel also a
little bit like a mother duck and I've
got all my like duckling under my wing
I'm like protecting them I don't think
I'm gonna be winning any fashion awards
for this look but it was nice to have
the family all together again
so it's like actually really hot out
here especially at all of our other
stuff so I'm gonna tie this around my
waist just you guys know this is how you
have to do it
and then tie them in the back I don't
think anyone else was enjoying my outfit
but my only regret was wearing the hairy
chest swimsuit like a leotard because it
got a tad swampy down there okay so that
was my week wearing the Y project
oversized denim jacket I would say that
this jacket is not something I would
wear casually in fact it's pretty
difficult to style it looks kind of
stupid like you don't really look like a
human you look more like a squid or any
number of other different things but if
you're not concerned about how this
jacket looks at all
this jacket is very enjoyable I still
think it's crazy that this jacket costs
$700 it is just kind of like an
avant-garde fashion look that's popped
up in real life but who knows you might
be able to earn some of the money you
spent on this jacket you know doing some
work outside of a car dealership if this
jacket were cheaper I would be an
advocate for this jacket as is I would
say probably don't buy it but I would
also say to why project
don't let the haters get you down don't
change your marketing photos you do you
as for me the tags are still on so we'll
see if after this video is uploaded if
they'll still let me try and return it
