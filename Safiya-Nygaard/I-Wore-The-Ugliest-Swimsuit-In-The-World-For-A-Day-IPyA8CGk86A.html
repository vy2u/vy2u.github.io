video so another ugly clothing item has
found me and this time is a swimsuit
I say found me because it feels like
these things just keep popping up I
don't know if 2017 is just the year of
ugly clothing items but they're just
it's laughable so over the last couple
of weeks I've seen this sexy chest
swimsuit pretty much everywhere on the
internet this swimsuit is fifty dollars
it's made by a company called beloved
shirt and many an article had something
to say about it this hairy chest
swimsuit exists for better or for worse
the internet is understandably horrified
by this hairy chest swimsuit so we've
come to this hairy dude sexy chest
one-piece swimsuits for women and now
without further ado the sexy chest
swimsuit they come in a few different
skin tones I think I got the lightest
one we've got some nice nipple action
going we've got some nice butt hair or I
guess lower back hair I'm not exactly
sure what the gradient is perhaps like a
sunburn of some kind
this lower crotch region has pretty much
guarantees the D monetization of this
video it almost looks like modern art in
a way like it's like it's saying
something making a statement but I don't
know what it is now usually with ugly
clothing items I'll wear them for a week
straight to try like different
combinations of other items to try and
style them I feel like with a swimsuit
you're pretty much on your own like
you're supposed to just wear this alone
into the water so I'm just going to
spend one day be chopping and just
seeing what people have to say so let's
go try it on because I don't think that
were quite ready for this jelly are you
ready are you ready I think so for this
jelly oh my god I wasn't ready I feel um
like I'm playing like a fun practical
joke and also like I'm going to get
definitely kicked out of places
I don't want to ruin someone's day at
the beach like I don't want to like
upset a child there's a lot of things
happening I'm not even getting into this
yet number one is the nice contouring
that my boobs are getting from this nice
shadow
it does look you have a second pair of
boobs the nipples are very far to the
side they are yeah yeah so there's a bit
of a differential you know the one can
assume that whatever's going on in the
crotch is meant to be like your lower
abdomen
yeah I'm not enjoying the crotch right
now there's a quick flash of the crotch
it's very unsettling
I don't like twirl my son turns around
the house another fun thing I think it's
the back I think that this lighter until
is quite pink looks like a swimsuit
rather than an evening naked but it
looks like someone else's chest I don't
know what other people are going to
think if other people are going to think
it's funny or if we're going to be like
that's kind of explicit it's less about
like how I look in it and more like I
don't want anyone else to yell okay so
it's the next day I'm wearing my ugly
swimsuit underneath a little bit of an
outfit just so I don't get kicked out of
places
this is the worst thing you ever done no
I'm just kidding oh my god that is that
was the worst thing I've ever done one
thing I will say though that I'm liking
is that I'm not worried about my hairy
arm I'm not worried about any cellulite
I'm like they're going to be looking at
this that's the most glass half-full
explanation ever heard so we started off
today with some pre beach Aaron we're
going to grab maybe some coffees and
breakfast on the way and then we're
going to grab some beach supplies and
towels
gonna let it out oh my god let it back
in we're walking into Starbucks again
you're gonna get us banned from all
Starbucks ever please please don't ban
me it just let me have more coverage
though hi gotta be honest yeah I kind of
excited the figure that kind of has a
goal against the shadow so I went into
Starbucks firm and the cashier was very
friendly she made very direct eye
contact she just smiled then you stood
in the lapel
she's got some manners oh I just got a
good look in the car window can you see
it direct ocean because I got little
hairs there they're just like really
fine ones like I've got like a fine
coating okar at Target while we were
shopping for our beach towel I noticed a
couple people who glanced at my open
shirt not a lot of like extended stares
or reaction but definitely Samuel when
you think about it for a little bit it's
like excess body hair like it's not that
big of a deal
yeah it just really does kind of visual
impact and of course I gotta go so made
some small talk with the cashier oh we
were getting our towels
she was totally not looking I feel like
under a shirt it can almost get away
with being like a peach tank top with
some pattern on it so I don't think
people are really like looking too hard
they're approaching the beach I can't
wait actually at Target the cashier also
told us that it she'd seen many people
going to the beach today so it might be
very crowded which is exactly what I
want
you ain't vanishing this Beach so I
wanted to do a good reveal down of the
beach so I like put my flannel back on
and tied it sort of at the midriff this
is just the best take of this bathing
suit where it's like normal outfit and
what is that it's just like it looks
like a skin tone but it's just not the
same as yours actually the best part is
that you can't get speed the belly
button yeah really buns all the way down
there oh my god I'm Kyle XY I don't have
a belly button the major was almost more
of a like oh is that her so we just
walked by a family and they were very
smiling and happy and then they all
looked very concerned ly down straight
at my midriff I think that this bring
that's our probably my biggest gripe
with the suit is that it's not just a
naked person it's a naked chest
stretched out so you know when I'm
wearing it to expose my midriff the
belly button is way further down because
they've stretched the chest out that
brings us to a different problem which I
encountered once I stripped down to the
bare necessities
no the beach was very crowded lots of
people playing volleyball people on the
pier lots of families there and as I
drop trou the crotch became except now I
find the frontal crotch to be a little
more upsetting than the behind bootie
because the behind the bootie is just
like a nice hairy bootie something about
the front you kind of follow the arrow
that's pointing downwards all those
involuntarily
and you're almost as you go down
expecting to see someone's junk on this
bathing suit and there's nothing there
it's like a hairy Ken doll it's down
into nothing man yeah I would say the
hairy chest is funny yeah I told you go
down into there you're like nobody wants
that right now I feel like the bottom
part of the swimsuit just brings up a
lot of questions and a lot of emotions
now as soon as I strip down a guy
further up the beach started cracking up
so this girl Nadia looked around to see
the source of the laughter and spotted
my suit and came up to talk to me Nadia
what do you think
now nadia was very nice but she was also
a straight shooter she didn't really
like the bathing suit
oh it's really bad Oh what's this Nadia
do you think this is the ugliest bathing
suit ever yeah haha now I'm a
pass-through target and Starbucks
relatively unscathed but I think
something about wearing these swimsuits
fully exposed did get me a couple of
stink eyes from some parents I think
there's a couple people who are upset
over there there's like a dad this is
like looking at me with his daughter
they were kind of upset yeah I'm going
to actually get a kiss there okay there
isn't really anything to be upset about
because you don't really see anything
it's just body hair on a chest but it's
kind of like the illusion or like
implication of nudity you know it's hot
dogs or hairy bathing suit on this in
suit also has a track record of
upsetting kid I think people preferred
me when I was either laying down on the
beach towel this was going to be in the
SI swimsuit edition that is or when I
was fully submerged in the water I did
get some good Baywatch running in which
I'm not sure how people felt about but
it was you know state I had fun such a
dramatic run I don't look like David
Hasselhoff you do have a big day to the
house ha ha put on sale how are you
feeling
I'm fine let's redo this role walk trot
down we decided to walk around the pier
and get some lunch so I decided to put
my shorts back on and once the shorts
were back on and I was kind of wandering
around with the swimsuit almost as a top
the day change so we just went to like
the shower a bit really quick one girl
pointed at me and left and a different
girl said she liked my bathing suit so
in the showers 50/50 I will say though
that without the crotch aspect like now
that I put my shorts back on I feel way
less weird about it people were left
like stink
eyes / like look away chuckle awkwardly
and way more outwardly approving of the
bathing suit I made the new friend we
want more hair I think what people are
trying to figure out like oh is this
ugly like yeah it's not a very
attractive bathing suit but it's also
hilarious so it has more of a sense of
humor than any of the other like ugly
clothing items we've tried on you know
that ain't trying to look really good
this was by far the best collection good
time reaction like I feel like a lot of
people were enjoying it there's people
are talking about the swimsuit over
there in the bar like through the bar
they're like
hang on I did still surprise a couple of
people who saw me in their peripheral
vision I thought you might be making it
or Guyer and then I'll because I jog
like you're sure to have big poster yeah
the nipples are like I was like dreams
on the outside okay like for the forest
scene or something I City morning on so
we did a little bit of beach-hopping
after lunch we went a little bit further
north to a different Beach which was
actually much more crowded and had much
more of like a pier boardwalk scene and
I think that when we were on the
boardwalk not a lot of people were
noticing the swimsuit or giving it too
much attention I think it's just so more
happening so so many things out more
like three performers more street
vendors it kind of just felt like part
of the scene like it's like oh maybe you
could have bought that on this pier but
if we walk a little bit further away
from the crowd I did get some good
laughs one person actually came up to me
and asked me they can take a picture of
my bathing suit lolly just took a
picture of my shirt my shirt I just feel
like it's the extreme version of those
white t-shirts that have the chests or
bikini bodies on them like it's just
kind of like a fun beach gag that
everyone's been on so my final test of
the swimsuit was to prank people with it
alright I'm here with my friend Natalie
ballot and Wednesday
tell me they don't know what's here
maybe I have attempted a secret from
them so I've been a reveal what's under
my shirt we hung out for awhile before I
told him that I was secretly wearing
something that I wanted them to see it
was kind of a creepy thing to say to
someone but they took it in stride I
promise it's not just my naked body I'm
like slowly unbuttoning to be honest the
worst part is the crotch it's just
smooth I feel like on the beach with
Shore some people can kind of like take
it in on their own time but at a
restaurant it was kind of shocking so
what's the verdict it is the ugliest
baby food in the world and it's
violating so I think that this did prove
a good swimsuit for pranking people so
after getting to know this swimsuit a
little bit better I think it's a good
swimsuit in that like I think it's made
nicely like I have no qualms with the
stitching or anything like that I think
it's like a decent quality swimsuit it
is what it is and it makes sort of no
apologies about it one reason I might
not wear it again though is just because
I feel like there is some awkwardness
about the crotch area I am personally
very Pro body hair acceptance like I've
got some body hair on me on the stache
on the arms on some other places too so
I don't think that it's necessarily
funny just because it's a hairy chest I
think it's more funny because it just
plays with your expectations like you
wouldn't expect to be wearing someone
parry chest on your swimsuit but it does
though it makes me kind of want to meet
this person and be like I've worn your
chest I wouldn't say I've walked a mile
in his shoes we probably walked about
half a mile in his chest this also makes
me kind of want a tiler chest swimsuit
how is that very full chest hair right
here
Wow right you look great I'm Harry

hair
