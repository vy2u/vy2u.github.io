video today I'm going to be trying out
Japanese dollar store makeup so Daiso
originated as a 100 yen store in Japan
but the majority of the items in
American dies those cost a dollar and
fifty cents so it's a dollar fifty store
not a dollar store so I'm sorry for the
clickbait you guys I actually hadn't
seen any of these Daiso stores before I
moved to California I have been inside a
few of them but I've never bought
anything yet there seem to be a lot of
fun trinkets and snacks inside but I'm
thinking we should go for the makeup
I've seen some people do dollar store
makeup challenges I've also seen some
people do videos about makeup from Daiso
so I'm thinking we should go in there to
get us a full face worth of makeup and
see how it is
I'm excited honestly I feel like we're
going to find some hidden gems maybe
they're not so hidden only hidden to me
I think I'm going to find some gems you
find the makeup oh no I just got I got
sidetracked by these fluffy mess
no I'm telling to make it yet but I just
need a big back we're a little bit on a
time crunch we have to get this stuff
for closes so happy
so hopefully Sofia is able to find these
things so add dye so I picked up
eyebrows stencils
honestly like I could use these though
if these work that would be awesome I
also grabbed some fake lashes I'm really
bad at fake eyelashes if it was really
fun these ones are kind of like party
lashes they've got a few spikes sticking
out a pretty standard looking eyebrow
pencil this is eyeliner Oh more eyebrow
oh wow there's a lot of stuff happening
this funky-looking eyeshadow brush what
what is that it looks like an our teeth
brush but it's very skinny and small
honestly I'm not exactly sure how it's
an eyeshadow brush but I'm excited to
find out this mascara it's called long
lash which I mean as I want long lashes
so hopefully it lived up to its name
this cheek and highlight duo
it's called orange they're all orange
let's go for it why not
I got some makeup sponges kind of like a
large variety pack there's one
heart-shaped one in the back that looks
kind of promising for these things this
potion bottle looking eyeliner you lift
this up there's a pencil liner and then
in this bottle down here is liquid
eyeliner oh yeah this stick concealer
this is the only one they had in this
call
Larrick the color looks kind of bright
music and it had been like smushed
against the top but I chose this one
because I think it's the right color for
me or at least somewhat close hopefully
they're all the same colors are ideal
the same color I think so I got this off
for stylish silky milk foundation I got
two colors to mix together since I think
my skin tone is in the middle somewhere
and then let's get a powder just to
powder it all down couldn't find any
loose powder but I'm excited to try this
powder out I also got this slightly
darker stick foundation because if you
use this probably for a contour and then
I got two lipsticks
they're both peachy colors this one's
more nudie and this one looks just like
straight-up gold and this bronzer /
blush to be used as eyeshadow I couldn't
find any eyeshadow besides one really
blue palette and at that point I had
already picked out so many like peaches
and golds I was like we can't do this
also I got this back matte this one has
Alice and cat and the cat this cats
wearing a tie this owls me cuz look at
his eyebrows okay so let's get right
into it let's start putting some stuff
on my face I do have a few brushes in a
beauty blender right here that are also
not from Daiso just in case I need them
I feel like I probably will but don't
worry this eyeshadow brush will come
into play at some point let's start with
brows I'm going to open my basic line
eyebrow template looks like there's only
one stencil in here and then in
conjunction with our eyebrows stencil we
will be using this eyebrow pencil okay
I'm going to use my schoolie and brush
my brows up eyebrows have been through a
lot today okay here we go so here's my
eyebrow template I've definitely got a
bit of a tail sticking out I'm holding
it so this corner is digging into the
bridge of my nose which seems accurate a
little bit of concentration needed for
this I don't know that that was perfect
but it kind of gave me a little bit of
something to work with like I can just
sort of fill in where the stencil was
not okay so I'm going in the the right
brow with my little stencil this one
doesn't hurt my bridge of my nose as
much so I feel like it might not be even
let me just try just stick it right in
there I'm going to fill in the rest of
the brow and like I did on the other
side the stencil kind of left out some
hairs that I have under
here I think I'm just going to brush him
through a little bit and then we're
going to we're going to keep going okay
so next up let's do I shadow I have this
eyeshadow brush which I don't understand
this blush and then this cheek and
highlight duo and we're just going to
use these three and come up with
something in case this brush hasn't
really worked for me they all just keep
it around and like a face brushing brush
needs kind of nice right so I'm going to
use like the highlighter shade with this
brush just like as a as an all-over
situation actually I have no method to
the madness right now for a step that
requires like not that much precision
it's working fine I'm not going to give
up on this brush until this brush gives
up on me and then I'm going to try and
take this orange shade and put it on my
lid I don't know if this brush is
actually doing enough we're just going
to keep using it because it says it's an
eye shadow brush I think I got a pretty
a pretty decent like lid general
covering with this brush I'm going to
try and put this blush like in my outer
like corners and crease oh maybe I do
like this like almost like use it like a
fan like opening a windshield wiper I'm
gonna be honest though this stuff is
where it's at that's where the pigments
coming in coming in hot
I wonder if you could use this like sort
of toothbrush motion oh wow I introduced
a lot of pigment there I think I was
just trying to demonstrate and then I
just got carried away I actually once I
just use my finger really quick there I
got a lot more pigment on so let me just
try this orange again with my finger Oh
actually there's a lot more
all right so fingers might be the way to
go I think that I went from Effie
Trinket
to like tropical macaw so now that I've
done all this I should do foundation
yeah foundations next yeah yeah yeah
yeah who's that means I'm gonna use my
makeup sponges I dampen both of these
sponges they look feel a little bit
sticky and neither of them got too much
bigger with water right here is the
lighter color that I got this one is
color one I also have what is actually
now that I look at the number this is
number five let's take our Beauty sponge
and just mix them together alright well
it just disappeared let's beyond here
let's see
nothing came off no can use the green
sponge now but see if that comes off of
my face well there's something but I do
think that this sponge is absorbing a
large amount of the product because it's
just like I'm already out of everything
okay
maybe sponges are not the way to go okay
so I'm going to go back to my Beauty
Blender oh wow
that's such a difference oh interesting
look at what it's doing it like very
tacky actually like I feel like the
color match is like not too too bad
mixing those two colors together did
work it doesn't feel super comfy but it
does look pretty nice just like kind of
like a natural coverage all of these
makeups have like a really vintage smell
I'm not sure if I nailed this color
match to this other side might be a
little more orange or yellow than I
anticipate it but just going with it I
actually do like how it looks after a
little bit of beat in the face so next I
have this Dantes super blendable
concealer that I'm going to put under my
eyes and then I have this clean color
skin deep lightweight stick foundation
and I'm going to try and use as a cream
contour all right I don't know I'm going
wild you guys I don't know why I just
did that why'd I do that I don't know I
just I got carried away with this
concealer now I'm going to have to blend
it out says super blendable oh that
really did blend away really quick okay
let's see under the eyes I can't just go
into Bionic blending mode and see if I
can't just move I'm going to bring this
concealer back out and put them on my
staff I actually wish I had like a
liquidy type concealer for under the
eyes but everywhere else on the face I'm
liking this concealer I think it's time
to bring out the cream contour I don't
have a lot of experience with cream
contours so this could be an interesting
ride and then a little bit on the sides
of my nose that's not like baby powder
sounds like a baby's butt hmm want to
put that on my face I kind of feel like
I've got some been nice stage makeup
going on all this stuff is actually
blending out pretty well usually I would
do some baking powder next but since I
couldn't find any loose powder I'm just
going to powder myself down with this
compact powder this brand Sante seems to
be like pretty much the number one
so makeup brand most of the stuff is
santé yeah okay so I think the powder
was a little bit darker than you know my
general foundation so I'm just going to
powder my neck and just kind of down the
shirt a little bit just to kind of
disguise that fact next I'll do some
cheek action I'll bring the blush back
in I'm going to use the orange side of
my seductive cheek duo I actually like
this color it is quite orange but you
know that's part of the look we're
creating I like that I just picked up
everything in like one color I was like
everything's kind of orange the eyes are
kind of orange the cheeks are kind of
orange the contours a little orange the
powder is a little orange okay so now I
think next I'm going to do some eyeliner
I do have this potion bottle looking
thing so what I'm going to do is use
this pencil liner that's like the top of
the potion bottle and draw a little bit
of a line that will be my cat eye winged
it does a little sharp feeling by my eye
oh oh it hurts a little bit okay so now
I'm going to take the liquid liner
that's in the base of this potion bottle
and see what I can do about drawing the
rest of the line in I swear I don't know
why this feels not sharp on my hand but
on my eye at fuel sharp not loving that
part about it but I do like you know
some decent liquid liner okay so that is
one eye down let's do the second eye now
and it's hard to talk law and do my
eyeliner I'm just realizing like I'm
being very quiet right now okay I don't
think I nailed my eyeliner today but I
do think that the pixie jar did a pretty
good job as well as being incredibly
cute and reminding me of a Polly Pocket
like I mean the old-school Polly Pocket
where she was a choking hazard and lived
only in hard plastic next I'm going to
put some mascara on and as you guys are
experiences if you ever like to do a lot
of liquid eyeliner your lashes are
already kind of like clumps together /
like have coatings on them I'm really
feeling like the liquid eyeliner as I'm
going through my lashes with this
mascara one besides the fact that it
smells pretty chemically it actually
looks pretty decent I really like what
it did on my bottom lashes like it
definitely made them look really long so
long lash it is ok so we're nearing the
final stages I have two lipsticks here
I'm going to swatch them both just to
see okay so this is the first one
there's no
much of anything it looks like kind of a
goldish blah it smells very strongly up
with a fruity Crayola crayon very well
yeah actually smell it boom and then
this is the gold one the second one ooh
yeah it's like a metallic gold peach
color I mean maybe we should just do
both I'm going in first just a little
moisturizing action with this twinsies
there's kind of a little bit of like a
frost to this one just kind of like a
mid-2000s early 2000s gloss then I'm
going in with the femme lipstick oh yeah
making sure to cover that inner
waterline the butt hole nothing better
than a golden butt hole I always say
this lipstick does get some nice color
but you do have to like keep layering I
think a little bit I think this golden
lipstick actually furthers the parent
narrative of this look I'm kind of
thinking of like iago from Aladdin like
he's got kind of like a golden peachy
beak okay so this is my entire look
using the die so makeup I thought that a
lot of it was actually really good oh I
did get and forgot my fake lashes they
were disguised under the makeup sponges
so halt the review let me put these on
really quick I've already put mascara on
so this should also be interesting but
we'll just put a little bit more on the
fun thing is these actually worked into
the Iago scene because they kind of feel
like feathers Wow look at that lash holy
carp okay so looking at these fake
lashes look like my eyes are about to
take flight away from my body but they
definitely brought the whole like look
firmly into costume land Halloweentown
I'm impressed over all the things I
might actually use going forward would
probably be the eyebrow pencil this
concealer and this golden lipstick I
actually think that the performance of
this lipstick makes me want to go back
and buy other colors of this lipstick
just to have more of these like cheap
fun colors that you might need in a
random situation I wouldn't recommend
the tools that they have like the
brushes sponges that kind of stuff that
I tried at least but I would recommend a
few of these items and especially things
that come in stick form I found that the
sticks worked the best I think I got to
go back to Daiso
get more snacks get another bath mat man
these lashes I can't take myself
I look I I look like a bird of light
