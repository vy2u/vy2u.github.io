video today I'm going to be doing
something a little bit stupid and a
little bit irresponsible I'm going to be
melting all of my nude lipsticks
together to make one lipstick this
decision was inspired by two things one
I had a cold recently and I've been
really hopped up on nyquil and dayquil
don't do that kids it's a bad idea
and - I saw Christine from simply me
illogical do this a little bit ago where
she combined all of her holographic nail
polishes into one mega nail polish brew
but I don't have any nail polishes so
I'm going for what I do have which is
lipsticks you guys may know I've said it
before I'm a bit of a lipstick hoarder I
have a hard time throwing away lipstick
no matter how old it is I wanted to go
for nude because one I buy a lot of
stuff and two I also thought that if I
melted all my lipsticks together in
general I would just end up with black
lipstick which I like but I already oh
so maybe if I just stick to the nudes
I'll end up with a new nude color that
is a pseudo midpoint of all of them and
I'm curious to see what that would look
like and then tomorrow I'm going to wear
it all day and see what happens see if
it is actually a lipstick or if it's
just a monstrosity alright so I've got
my cutting board mold jar makeup wipes
my makeup mirror in case I get
sentimental my paper for swatching and
my lipsticks alright I'm going to start
off with a lipstick that's very near and
dear to my heart
this is mrs. Norris she is one of the
custom lipsticks that I made at the bite
lick lab in January I'm just going to
swatch just a little bit just so we can
see she's a little bit more of a brown
than new but I think the line between
Brown and mute is going to be pretty
Lurie today here here we go I'm like
nervous for this um I don't actually
want to use like the entirety of every
tooth of mine nude with six so I'm
basically just going to be like kind of
chopping the tips kind of like mildly
circumcising that is not enough
maybe we need like a little bit more it
still works yeah we'll take more from
the other one that made me
we nervous am I going to be able to go
through with this this second one is a
NYX matte lipstick in the colour butter
I really like this color but whenever I
put it on it has very poor but whole
coverage oh look at that look like tiny
mouse turds in there all right I'm going
to blow through a couple of these let's
start shopping shall we
this is a color pop one in Aquarius the
oldie but a goodie I had for a couple of
years e4 so this still works if anything
is a new beginning you know where we're
sloughing off all that dead skin on the
top and melting it all together so I've
been putting them into this glass bowl
and it's looking like I might need to be
a little less stingy I'm having a cha
XIV I think I broke it we're going to
have to bring in a lighter for some
emergency lipstick surgery because I
will have no fatalities on my set today
I just melted it and I'm going to put it
back together
maybe it'll never again be as straight
as it once was but it's reattached at
least Wow look at the amount of nudie
Browns that I bought in my lifetime I
don't know if this feels like a hoarders
episode but I do feel like a little bit
exposed alright ready for another one
this is Harvick first but as I keep
going through my lipsticks I'm like I
could spare a little more look at my
surgeons rags oh my god alright what's
up next this one I brought out it's not
a solid lipstick but it's also not
really a liquid lipstick like it doesn't
dry down here's one the double-sided so
we get to pick a bit off of both sides
pull them both out and you're just like
Darth Maul okay so this is the same type
as the one that broke earlier I'm going
to be careful with this I'm kind of saw
instead of like chop I was also thinking
of putting in a bit of this white I was
messing around with it thinking like oh
maybe I'll put it in and then the tip
broke completely so we're just going to
throw the tip right in so this is the
last one it is one of my favorite to
ever this is the Urban Decay vice
lipstick in oblivion
I'm not going to decapitate too much
because this one is too valuable to me
okay so here is my little bowl and here
is my slot paper I really hope there's
enough for one lipstick in there if not
we're going to come back and chop a
little more
but let's melt it down and see what we
got all right so we're down here we've
got the mixture and we've got my little
pan and here is my little Amazon
lipstick mold okay
so first let's heat up the pan and then
I just gotta scoop it out basically sort
of like chocolate chips it's melting
right away oh wow
just get this off with the spatula come
on you old bitches just want to get
every last bit
no lipsticks died in vain today Wow it
is totally melted already I'm mixing
together doing something don't burn it I
think it's maybe already just like ready
to go I think that was all the melting
that we got it looks a lot like
chocolate I will reaffirm that I am the
augustus Gloop of lipstick my plan is to
pour this mixture into the beaker maybe
we should have just put it in the beaker
and microwave it to begin with
put it in the beaker and then put
straight into little tube I'd do it
alright ready yes oh I have to go before
it solidifies boom goes the dynamite ha
that's it and now there's like a little
bit of lipstick left everywhere but I'm
glad that we had enough for one tube so
what my friends at ritual de fée taught
me was that you put it in the freezer
for like 10 minutes now and then when it
gets out we'll try and put it in a tube
or we'll have to remelt it and put it
into a lip balm pot because it's not
going to fit but we'll try okay I'm
going to pour the leftovers into the
speaker and then try and microwave it
and see if we can't put the extras into
that little lip on - oh that is very
Gus's scoop right there see pure
chocolate all right so that's our extras
all right looks pretty good it you know
saw how this all edible
tastes like lipstick anyway else is
going to taste like it's been ten
minutes let's see how we're doing I'm
really hoping that this lipstick will
fit into the tomb oops but we'll see the
fitting I think so so how do I take the
cap off maybe I twist it off
no I'm ruining it where you just take it
off and put it in
we're just you know oh oh I got it I got
it ready boom goes the dynamite
that was so so elegantly done smooth and
elegant is what you meant to say but it
fits ready Wow
how do you like the color that looks
nice all right let's go swatch it
so we have our lipstick and our extra
lipstick right here I'm pretty pleased
with the color it's kind of nudie
brownie rosy a little bit rosier than I
expected but looks like it could be good
I mean it's swatch in I think it looks
pretty much like the mixture of all
those colors all right
three on the mouth shall we really light
well weird as I keep applying it so it's
a bit better there we go we're getting
some color out of it now I don't know I
might have so many lighter news we
mentioned it got heavier on the brown
ones in my closet okay so this is my lip
color there's a lot of different
textures going on it's quite full
coverage which I like like you can't
actually see my lips through it which is
cool it's just very light I didn't
expect it to be this light and I do have
a fair amount of lighter nudes that I
don't use very often and I think that
maybe my hand went a little bit choppier
into the ones that I don't use as often
because I was like I could use this one
up but overall I liked it I think it
kind of reminds me of like a Kim
Kardashian nude color you know one of
those pictures where she's kind of like
Heather hair wet for some reasons it's
not really the mid points that I was
thinking of but it's some type of
midpoint so I'm going to take my tube of
Frankenstein nude and I'm going to wear
it around tomorrow and see how it lasts
throughout the day how the coverage is
you know just do some check ins and see
see how this lipstick really is so it's
not exactly tomorrow it is in fact
actually a couple of days later
this is actually my childhood bedroom
I'm actually in Chicago right now I've
been like on the road the last couple of
days but I finally have an afternoon off
so I can spend some quality time testing
out the formula of my Franken lipstick
there are a lot of different formulas
that went into the lipstick like sheer
shiny creamy matte like
everything basically so we'll see sort
of what happens there it is it's still
smells kind of like baby powder I wonder
if when I cooked it I lost some of the
sense of the other lipstick I don't know
if that's possible but it kind of feels
like that might have happened all right
let's try and put it on oh wow it goes
on like pretty opaque from the beginning
it definitely feels like the type of
lipstick that would transfer very easily
but also feels like really comfortable
on your mouth let me just fix my Cupid's
bow really quick okay so I'm going to
take my lipstick out of the town and
we'll see kind of how it lasts and how
it performs as a regular lipstick I have
a good feeling one advantage of this
lipstick being a little bit lighter is
that the butt whole lip is almost
imperceptible like it's not the exact
color of the inside of my mouth but it's
pretty hard to tell when the waterline
begins and that is ideal I'll have to
name it don't I did I named it already
okay
so I've come up with three possible name
the first one is bikini bottom
because I've sinking you know things
that are nude but my other options are
cargo shorts and coffee-mate do you guys
let me know in the comments which one
you like better bikini bottom cargo
shorts or coffee-mate as the name of
this Franken lipstick okay also I just
noticed there's a lipstick on my cheek
chin area this thing is already
transferring even before I try and make
a transfer
so speaking of transfer I did get some
iced coffee and a clean straw so we can
see like what the damage is alright
ready the coffee is pretty good a little
bitter but there is definitely transfer
not as much as maybe I thought there
would be but like you know it's going to
come off yeah no that's more mouth I was
just thinking that like once this tube
runs out I'll like never get to have
this color again so actually since I
like left home like seven years ago
there has since sprung up an Ulta in my
neighborhood so I'm going to walk over
to Ulta right now and see if I can't
find a good dupe okay so i swatched my
lipstick which will
help me in my service so let's try and
find something that matches that right
none of these are right that one right
on top of it looks kind of similar but
like in person it looks much cooler none
of those are quite right either
yeah maybe I should wipe these off and
start again all right
I started over and still kind of stuck
in between a few shades it's honestly
hard to find a good deeper then maybe
it's just it's own unique child so after
all my Ulta adventures the thing that I
found that was the closest piece of
action this mixed lip liner which is in
the color London it's not the same corny
line probably exactly the same color but
it's clothing the hunt is still on for
the dupe for this but this lip liner is
not too far off also how do I end up
buying more nude lipstick for this video
anyway it was time to get food so I went
to my favorite place in the world hot so
I got a big turkey on wheat with mutton
and I'm gonna eat it and what happened
to my lipstick it I am crouching down a
little bit so I cannot get in frame we
may not stay further back now we shall
throw
okay so as I suspected the sandwich
pretty much destroyed my lipstick
there's a little bit of lipstick left on
the top lip but not on the bottom lip
and then there's like a little bit of
lipstick residue like right off the chin
at this point I would definitely have to
reapply but like it's been a few hours
so I'm pretty impressed you know there's
a lot of things happening in that
sandwich that tastes amazing but maybe
aren't feel friendly to the lipstick
this kind of works I brought like eight
lamps into this room to like get some
light in here so the evening ended up
bringing very little so we're just kind
of like hung around of my lipstick and
it's looking pretty good overall I'd say
that I'm pretty happy with how this
turned out I like how it goes on I think
it's quite opaque and it does last like
a decent amount of time like it wasn't
like gone in two seconds does not last
through straws or food but you know I
don't know that many stick lipsticks
that do all in all I would say it was a
pretty successful bad makeup experiment
I don't think I'm going to be doing it
again
just because it did pay me to cut the
tips of those lipsticks off well I
actually do think I will continue to
wear this lip color I really actually do
like it I think it's very comfortable I
think I'm going to have to continue to
search for this dupe because like in
this light it looks like not a dupe but
like when you turn your hand it kind of
does the search continues thank you guys
