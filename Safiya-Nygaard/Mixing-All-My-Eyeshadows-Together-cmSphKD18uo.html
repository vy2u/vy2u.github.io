video today I'm going to be mixing all
of my eyeshadows together into one large
mega eyeshadow I've mixed some of my
makeup before I've mixed all of my nude
lipsticks together to make a Franken
nude and I've also mixed all of my
foundations together to make a Franken
nation I actually think both of the
previous mixtures have been pretty
successful so I am excited and ready to
do more bad makeup science as with many
other people who watch a decent amount
of beauty tutorials on YouTube I've
collected a decent amount of eye shadow
over the years but when it comes down to
doing my makeup I rarely have the time
to put it on maybe I'm just scared of
not blending enough but like it takes an
extra like 30 minutes if I want to do
eyeshadow maybe that's just me though so
I was thinking maybe if I made an
eyeshadow that contains all of my
eyeshadows in it that I could say that I
use all my eyeshadows all the time this
series may be called bad makeup science
but for me it's also bad leaps and logic
so I'm gonna try and make a Franken
shadow right now and if it works out I'm
gonna wear it all day tomorrow and see
how it is okay let's bring out the
shadows here is the makeup mirror and
here are the eye shadows there they are
so this is what I'm gonna do I don't
want to actually destroy my eyeshadows
because even though I don't wear them a
lot I still do wear them sometimes and
it does pain me to like destroy a
palette or like stab a pan so I'm gonna
just scrape off a little bit off the top
of each eye shadow and put it into this
empty pan right here and then once I've
done that with all my eyeshadows i'm
gonna use this makeup repairing mousse
to like set it down and hopefully it'll
turn into an eye shadow alright let's
begin i think my first victim is going
to be this Urban Decay electric palette
now this palette gets a lot of use in
general just because I use it a lot for
decades videos and there are also a lot
of fun colors so this will be a good
like first edition ooh
that make me feel good and bad inside
alright so I think that's a decent
amount let me just like dump it into my
container shall we oh these shimmer ones
are so fun I was starting off with this
palette so it's gonna start off colorful
but then we'll get into the you know
multiple brownie nudes that I have I've
got myself a few newt some transition
shades I don't use them but I have them
it's taking me so long to do this first
palette I feel like it's gonna take us a
long time to do this
it started off kind of delicate like the
bottom row is very much just like I'm
just gonna dusted it and now the top row
is just like blank blank blank you know
what they say you've got to break a few
eggs to make an eyeshadow palette
alright so this is the yield from our
first palette but before we celebrate
let's uh porn out for the eyeshadow that
died in Maine
so the second palette I'm gonna do is
the Kat Von D Alchemist holographic
palette it is not in fact holographic
but it is iridescent and fun to cat
wherever you are I'm sorry
it looks like flower or snow or
something else yes oh yeah I think the
feds are gonna see this video like caca
what's the movie we're at the end the
guy is the machine gun Scarface
yeah that's me okay so I'm just gonna
speed through a couple of these really
quick some of them are like super easy
to get up and especially with these ones
that I don't use as much I'm like
tempted to just keep going but I don't
want to skew it one way or another all
right I'm gonna excavate all four of
these and then pour them all in at the
same time this further confirms that I
am Ross let me get my caffeine out here
is this the right time to be doing high
surgery yes
I'm like honey boo boo I need my like
rocket juice just get going the shimmers
are much like softer and more fun to dig
around in than the Matt's I'm sure
that's a actual make up science but I
don't really know what excuse me as I
clean off my scalpel
these surgeons rags are gonna be very
interesting by the end the dexstar
probably less clean than Dexter Dexter
is kind of a clean freak I'm a messy
serial killer I kind of want to scoop up
all of the eyeshadows in a single row
and then like pour it in and have it
like cascade down like a waterfall one
thing that I am very happy about is that
I'm turning out to have so many
individual pans of eyeshadow that I
don't have to take that much from any
single one so I think all my eyeshadows
are gonna survive so next I'm going to
do my morphe Jaclyn hill palette
haven't really dug into this one too
much because I recently got it because I
missed about the first four restocks but
let's go some out I feel like my mixture
is looking less and less like a rainbow
and more and more like pizza toppings
you know you see some shaved parmesan
see some paprika alright I think I'm
losing some of my finesse here getting a
little Messier Jacqueline you just
really had to put so many colors in here
it's just it's taken me a little while
I've lost my cameraman I feel like this
shoot is just like kind of devolve amor
and more tyler's with the cat just
talking to myself while scraping away at
some eyeshadows things are going great
alright we're in the homestretch here
Jackie can I call you Jackie we've never
met I think this thing is like almost
filled up to be honest I think Jackie
really filled us in my surgeons rag is
actually more colorful now than my
mixture now it is further away from
pizza toppings and more like silt so
this is my last palate but like my
second to last thing this is my Z
palette full of little eyeshadows that
I've previously depotted there's one
blush in here but we'll throw that in
anyway these are actually probably gonna
be the easiest to dump in cuz there's no
lips or brush holders or anything or
other shadows to contend with it's been
so long since we started we start if I
going to talk about which wasn't the
best haul when did I turn into Shane
Dawson I'm just kidding I'm scared
machines it's all still here these four
eyeshadows are like ancient like since
freshman year of college ancient wow
that was seven years ago out of the mix
so we're finally on the last eyeshadow
this one is an urban decay single shadow
in the color Woodstock I got this during
these strangers pick my makeup video
Victoria helped me pick this out so
Victoria if you are watching this right
now look away this is like a really
really beautiful pink shadow I kind of
want to put a lot in but I also don't
want to take too much of it oh yeah well
that's a nice cherry on top oh okay we
are done finally with the first step
that took a very long time longer than I
expected
even though this doesn't even look like
that much like so many of them are
pallets that when you go through every
individual shadow it's just like so much
but I think actually
looking at it we do have definitely
enough to cover like the bottom of this
pan so basically what I'm gonna do now
is take one of these wooden sticks and
like mix it up based on the colors that
have gone into it I think this is going
to be brown I hoping it's a rainbow
definitely looks like it's gonna start
turning brown like I expected but when
you look really closely you can see all
the individual pigments and shimmers
yeah okay so I think I've done a pretty
good job of mixing so I'm gonna open up
this moon mousse kit which is like
apparently supposed to be this like
makeup repairing mousse so this is for
broken makeup they don't really say
anything about you know any bad makeup
science but hopefully it'll work
basically it looks like I should just
press down the makeup and then put the
mousse on it and then we pretty much
just wait for it to dry
so now that I've packed it all down this
little tool basically it says I'm just
supposed to dispense the mousse on top
of the broken makeup oh my god did you
see that it is getting eaten up I'm
supposed to cover the whole surface area
of the makeup so basically after this
I'm just supposed to test the mixture to
make sure it's pasty and not dry yeah I
don't think it's dry looking at the
instructions I think I've deviated
enough from the intended use case of
this product that they don't really
apply so I think I'm just gonna pack it
down a little bit more and then wait
overnight for it to dry it definitely
looks very much like a Franken shadow
right now there's a lot of different
elements that are still kind of whole in
there but it does look nice and shimmery
it looks like a deformed pop-tart I
think you're just hungry
hi I'm hungry let me clean up my
workspace and my surgeons rags and let's
go to bed and see what happens tomorrow
okay
so it's the morning time basically the
only step we have to do right now is
just flatten it out with this Stamper
again it's looking more purple can you
tell it's a mud purple okay so I'm
showered and ready to put my makeup on
so I think that we're ready to dive
right into this Frank and shadow it
smells good
I think that moon mousse stuff has like
a good scent okay so let's see what
happens when I try and swatch this guy
feels like maybe a little softer than
some eyeshadows but at the same time you
know it was just loose pigments and
you're you know ten hours ago we try to
get the rest of it off all right what
color is that it looks kind of like a
bruise it is funny to think about like
all of the different eyeshadows that
went in here to kind of just like make
like a brownie purple but I think that
it'll be nice on the face before we put
it on I'm gonna put on some eye primer
just to give this guy a fighting chance
and then next I'm gonna dip my brush in
the eyeshadow and I'm let's see how it
goes on mom is anything happening let me
just put on a little more I'm having a
hard time seeing it on camera
but I think it's kind of like a nice
smoky color it's almost like an
old-school mid-to-late mm smokey eye all
right so I'm gonna blend this a little
bit more and then I'm gonna put it on my
left eye and do the rest of my makeup
I'm also not gonna be using any other
shadows on my eyes just so we can like
focus in on the color and the
wearability of our Frank and shadow and
once that's done I'll check back in and
we'll see how it lasts throughout the
day okay so I'm finally finished with
the rest of my makeup and you can tell
how long it took me to finish my
eyeliner by the way the light has
changed in this room as I kind of like
put a little more on and like layered
the eyeshadow it's kind of looking more
purple than brown which is good in my
opinion though nothing wrong with a good
brown eyeshadow but I like the idea that
didn't just turn like muddy brown when I
mix them all together okay so I spent a
decent amount of time doing my makeup
today so um let's go outside and see
what we can do to try and test the
longevity of this thing see if anything
creases up if it fades anything like
that okay let's go all right in the car
there's no creasing or fading yet but it
has only been like an hour it's much
prettier than I thought I thought last
night look like mud and now I think it
looks like a color there's a little bit
of literal glitter in there like so I
don't know if you can actually see it
like it yeah but mostly it's pretty
iridescent which is cool that's uh it
looks really pretty I like this color
thanks ty okay so I'm gonna walk into
some more right now and swatch some
purple
plush brownish shadows and see if I
can't find one that's close to my Frank
and shadow color so let's watch it on my
hand so we have it as a reference it
just takes a couple of layers to really
get its full color I say the colors
should be called bruised banana maybe
bulwark shopping ok so after watching
these piece amount of eye shadows I
couldn't actually find one that seemed
to be a perfect dupe or even like a
super super close dupe none of them are
getting that really good bruise color
that I want the make up forevers eye
shadows seem to be like kind of close
but with lacking some like purple
undertones I feel like I have this one
and we put it in the mix so I flip the
search for the perfect dupe continues
but it is kind of cool that my shadow is
like a unique it's hard to duplicate
because I'm like is it glittering very
glittery yeah I just wanted to get a
shot of it in the full Sun so he had it
oh I like that don't look at the camera
nah the Sun okay so I think it's about
our 9:00 I'm wearing this eye shadow
it's a little bit late at night at this
point but we're gonna sit down and film
for a couple of hours in front of these
lights it's warm about what my head is
close to I mean obviously you'll see if
after filming how the eye shadow is
looking but to be honest it's like
pretty crease free alright so it's been
about 11 hours since I put the eyeshadow
on honestly I think that this eyeshadow
has outlasted pretty much everything
else on my face my foundations like kind
of breaking up like getting ready to
come off my lipstick I completely
reapplied now I'm wearing the Franken
lipstick and you know just eyeshadow
going strong man overall I like a lot of
things about this eyeshadow I do like
the color I like the staying power I
like kind of almost like how easy it is
to wear like I did kind of just like put
on one color and go and I was happy that
the moon mousse was able to make all
those little pigments into one eyeshadow
that dried down to become like a literal
shadow it's hard to like capture on
camera exactly what it looks like but I
think this is actually a pretty good
representation there are a couple of
things that I'm worried about with this
eyeshadow mostly I'm worried about the
literal like pan of shadow itself
because it looks a little bit like it's
cracking I feel like the first bad thing
to happen could be that this stuff
starts like flaking off my only other
complaint is that it takes a few swipes
to really build up the color so I
wouldn't say that the eyeshadow is like
super pigmented but once you got it on
the eyes it's it seems to be staying on
and I am as I intended in the beginning
of this video wearing all of my
eyeshadows so feeling good about that
too
