video today I'm going to be mixing all
of my foundations together into one nice
brew so that a month ago I did a video
where I melted all of my nude lipsticks
together into one Franken lipstick and
after that pretty successful experiment
I wanted to see what other makeups I
could mix and foundations came to mind
as one that would be possible firstly I
was interested to see what would happen
when I mix them together
but unlike lipsticks which are more just
like about your taste or like what you
like foundations are generally supposed
to match the skin on your face and I
still have yet to find my perfect
foundation one that has like the perfect
color perfect undertones and perfect
formula for my skin type so I was
thinking if I mix them all together
maybe I would get the midpoint of all of
them and then get something that's
closest to my perfect foundation so I'm
gonna mix all of my foundations together
right now to see what the color is like
and then tomorrow I'm gonna wear it all
day long to see how the formula is
alright let's bring in the foundation
here they are it is a little bit more
difficult to be a hoarder of foundation
than it is to be a quarter of lipstick
but I will say in general I do have
hoarding tendencies I don't like to
throw things away so a couple in here
might be expired or at least close to
expired so my plan is to go at this like
a baseball team like we're gonna have
every foundation come up to bat and I'm
gonna squirt like one good sport in of
each foundation see where we are do a
second at-bat and a third at-bat there's
no other baseball team there's just one
team though you know what I mean who
shall be the first victim why don't we
begin with my custom foundation now I
got this custom foundation for a video
in late March early April when I first
got it it was a little bit lighter than
I thought it would be an on camera it
looks like a dead-on match and in person
it looks like a little pale so perfect
it is not but probably this would be
like the closest to perfect that I have
okay so let's squirt this one in first
was that satisfying it's unclear next
let's do these mix total controlled drop
foundations I'm kind of like in between
the two of them I think but I like this
foundation mostly it's a little on the
watery side though it's like baby
formula but it's mostly good let's do
this urban decay one this is probably
one of the older ones that is in here
it's probably actually the oldest one
that's in here but I actually tried it
on earlier today to see if it was truly
expired and it seemed fine this
foundation is a little bit on the yellow
east side I like the formula the color
is just not quite right and I got the
chance to swatch it maybe I was just
like swept off my feet by the lady at
Sephora all right so I'm gonna burn
through a couple of these just because
there's a couple that aren't that
interesting they're just sort of like
ones that I use sometimes some of them
are more number one and others are more
like number two it's liquid foundation
so the texture was always going to be a
dynamic of this video I'm trying to make
sure they're all as equally in there as
possible without actually measuring them
okay so this is a sample of an it
cosmetics CC cream in medium that one
looks particularly like a skidmark I
used to use this thing all the time but
then I abandoned it because I thought it
might be the wrong call
but I'm bringing it back ah so this is a
NARS Velvet Matte skin tint that I used
pretty much all of last summer and it
was only at the end of the summer that I
realized that it was much more orange
than I had thought so naturally I have
to own up to my mistakes and put it in
that's enough that's quite enough okay
so this is my last one this is the
foundation that I use all the time
nowadays this is from the ordinary it is
a serum foundation and B color light
medium neutral so it is nice on the face
it's kind of like a stray shooter like
it kind of you know you'll squirt and
look it's a little excitable okay so
that's like one full rotation at this
point I'm actually not sure what the
color is gonna be like
I actually think probably the bigger
question is what the formula is gonna be
like when we start mixing them together
because there are a lot of different
textures in there weirdly it almost
smells like rubbing alcohol it'll be
fine
right but anyway I'm gonna go through a
couple more at-bats and then see how
much we have the thing is like I have
worn all of these separately so together
they should be fine it's not like it
suddenly turned radioactive it's just
the question of like how they'll work
together you know we do have a little
bit of like a volcanic island forming in
there we're just nearing the end with
this one so it's kind of like honest
last legs you know all right so that's
my second time through there's a decent
amount more in there so I really think
that three times through will be perfect
let's do it again this is a little less
violent than the lipsticks it's a little
more erotic there's a little bit of a
blockade forming at the neck I think I
might like eventually plop down
oh yeah I think that looks like enough
if it's really amazing we can always mix
more I suppose that's a big if she
almost looks like a layered mousse cake
looks like the Grand Canyon so I am
going to mix this all together with my
little wooden mixing tool hmm it's got a
milkshake vibe to it even it kind of is
turning a little bit like frothy almost
make me hungry
okay so I mix this guy up so I'm just
gonna put my cap on here basically the
way this thing goes that like it creates
like a vacuum you got to just pump away
until the foundation reaches the top
well it's ready this is our first
contact it's alive
no dip my brush in there and then let's
put on the face one two three oh that
looks pretty good it's a little on the
golden side but as I wipe it in it seems
to be not bad not bad the smell is like
sunscreen or something like strong maybe
that expired what it's just rearing its
ugly head the consistency is pretty thin
it's like a little on the watery side I
think the watery ones won out I actually
think that this may work somewhat I know
if it's a perfect equilibrium of all of
these colors but it's actually like a
pretty good foundation color just to
compare I'm just gonna put my
Frankenstein foundation next to my
custom foundation we'll see what they
look like next to each other see my
Frankenstein's a little bit more Goldy
than my custom I think because of my
tendency especially in mid-2016 to go
for the golden undertone
like a real strong parchment flavor but
we'll see how it does tomorrow because I
think the color is pretty good but the
formula is just really the question
Franken foundation is alive Franken
Dacian foundation Stein they're both ok
all right so it is tomorrow the next day
and I am ready to put on my Franken
nation I'm sticking with Franken nation
it looks pretty good still it's not
really separating there are a couple of
little spots where it feels like I
didn't mix it all the way let me just
give it a little shake I think this is
gonna do anything at all pump a little
on the back of my hand yeah it is a
little bit more watery than I might
expect it seems to be spreading fine the
odor is less strong than it was
yesterday so hopefully it's like calming
down a bit it's interesting like when I
touch this foundation with my finger
it's a little bit slippery but also
clings to my skin very quickly I think
I'm feeling like literally different
foundations doing different things I
like this light it's like low-key kind
of scary I'm like hello children
ok I think that is one full coat of
foundation let's take a look in like the
natural light so you can see what it
looks like um it seems to pretty
decently match my double chin when I do
my double chin test it is a little dewy
and it's not like a hundred percent full
coverage like you can see some rental
frecks old freckles but I'm liking it so
I am going to finish off my makeup
routine and then I'll check back in when
it's all done and then we'll see how it
lasts throughout the day all right so my
finishing touch have to be my Frank and
nude lipstick no one will know that I'm
just wearing a bunch of random stuff
mixed together on my face today so I
think I'm done with my makeup I'm ready
to go about my day I think that in
general the foundation is actually
pretty nice it's actually turned more
matte than I would have expected after
my first impressions last night and this
morning honestly my only concern is that
the foundation will stratify perhaps on
my face perhaps in the bottle and over
time
formulas willing to work well together
okay let's get on with it all right so I
am out and about right now it's a little
bit hot outside it's definitely hot
enough that I feel myself moistening I
don't think the foundation is moving
like when I wipe my face with my fingers
it's not just like coming off on my
fingers it's an interesting consistency
I've never tried a foundation that feels
exactly like this maybe it's because
there's so much SPF in there it kind of
feels like sunscreen in a way more like
a lotion here's my face in the full Sun
oh wow
doesn't look like there are any real
sunglass grooves around the nose that's
pretty darn impressive okay so it's a
couple hours later we are at Costco
right now I'm still not dewy I'm still
pretty matte which is very surprising so
I meant to be at Costco I completely
forgot that she was wearing this stuff
today I think that's great I like it
okay so it's been probably about four
hours maybe almost five at this point I
think I'm definitely getting a little
dewy around the cheeks but the rest of
my face is is pretty matte still I mean
it's a hot day outside and I've been
walking around for a while so I'm
finally getting like some shine but not
that much to be honest since it's doing
so well I kind of just want to see how
far we can push it so let's get some
spicy food and go to yoga just to see
what happens okay some kung pao chicken
and some sriracha later I
not really any shinier so spicy food is
warming my insides but my face is still
pretty decent so I guess our last resort
to try and take this thing down is hot
yoga that was a pretty hard class how's
it possible look at my hair right now my
face is in less bad condition that I
would think validation is just like
using into your skin hey that's kind of
how it feels to me right now I like it
so much I'm just absorbing it this is an
impressive foundation I'm generally
pumped that was a hard class I think we
got to go home and shower okay so we are
home after yoga now I have not yet
showered my nose is is got done for but
they're still foundation actually left
on the cheeks under the eyes maybe a bit
on the forehead maybe a bit on the chin
I didn't expect it to last through yoga
but I think up until that point it had
lasted pretty well one of my concerns
was that the foundation would settle in
the tube but I actually don't think it
did I'm just gonna maybe occasionally
stir this up again just to make sure
nothing's stratifying but on my face
it's working really well this experiment
actually did bring out a lot of the good
things about these foundations and also
like rain in the parts that I didn't
like as much I honestly would use this
foundation again I kind of want to mix
up more I think this Franken Dacian gets
a 9 and a half out of 10 but a 10 out of
10 would wear again definitely thank you
