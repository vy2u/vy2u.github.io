important message from Tyler's parents
basement and that is that I have never
been to Primark before I feel like some
of you might not even know what Primark
is that's okay we're kind of on the same
page in my lifetime I've watched a lot
of haul videos and a lot of zoella
videos and one of the wellas favorite
place to do haul videos from is Primark
but what is this magical lamp I know
what ASOS is Topshop you know top shops
made it across the pond I have an idea
of like what it must sell right she gets
clothes and home goods so to me is kind
of like the marketplace part of IKEA
forever 21 plus a little bit of hmm plus
a little bit like the Urban Outfitters
gifts in the corner like the cute
trinket and they all come together they
have like a little bit of a store Georgy
a store orgy and then they poop out a
baby it's called Primark I've lived for
the better part of the last six years
like 99% of the time in California so I
know that eventually some time in that
time
Primark started popping up on the East
Coast still never seen one until this
trip when we came to Philly to visit
Tyler's family for the holidays you can
buy stuff online from Primark but it
seems like part of the fun of Primark is
going because she said is that like
different Primark for better than other
ones kind of like how like different H&amp;amp;M
depending on where you are have a
different selection of stuff I'm going
to go to Primark to the very first time
I'm going to do a haul of my own I
honestly I never thought this day would
come
we are on our way to see pry marks very
first time there's Tyler how long until
you get there not find it oh wow I just
feel excited I've got some something
going on in the bowels whether it be
butterflies or a little bit of
no we're just in this car with each
other no no oh my lord love it according
stood but this is prime R prime real
estate for the Primus of prime boss is a
very large and impressive storefront it
looks very modern it's like a glass box
on the outside is gonna be crowded today
I think it's going to be crowded today
too but it doesn't matter because I will
persevere to Wi-Fi
holy crap when you walk in they have
like a whole good section and it's a lot
of like blanket pillows dropping cuz
you're hot what see it was made for you
I'd like this whole IKEA marketplace
element like these things I mean we've
been standing in this in this part for
running when heavily on the memory foam
the mannequins were just like a little
creepy because they would hide that in
corner there are a lot of things
happening around here in Oregon
department and it's kind of like kind of
like Target where you can easily like
transition from one department to the
next about knowing that you've done that
so I ended up in all a schoolgirl
section for a while just from the haul
videos I've seen I definitely understood
there were different departments I don't
think I guess how many departments like
the floor plan was very open and very
large we've gotten to the point where
bags are exciting for Sofia it's kind of
back there was a lot of stuff that I
picked up being like this is a good deal
like I want this flannel like I want
this backpack have economists there's my
look I want the shiny backpack like I
want this mess hat and then when I step
back I was like oh do I just want this
because I think it's a good deal or do I
actually want this this is the story
about a boy named Tyler early loan in
now's like no I think I'm just going for
it because I think it's a good deal
the thing is we got
we'll add up I mean there's a lot of
stuff in a lot of places and a lot of
people to kind of like rummage but when
you find something good your participant
health-oriented I think I did an okay
job of restraining myself not a great
job an okay job okay so I just checked
out and I'm pretty pleased with my home
but I'm going to go me telling this
report because she gave up a little
while ago and started eating Chinese
food and I said goodbye to prom ah no so
now for the most exciting part of it all
my haul my very first Primark haul so
the first thing I got is this that I
refuse to leave behind and I honestly
probably should have left it behind
because it was kind of a bitch to fit it
in our suitcase this memory foam pillow
I'm getting them I'm here with my
Superman the tag says $12 it was on sale
for 10 and it is bands and memory foam
that seems like a nice kind let's get it
out of this case because I've been
waiting to open this thing up I haven't
even opened it up belt it or anything oh
my god it feels so nice I'm going to get
makeup all over it's putting my face on
it feels so nice on my body oh yes you
know what this pillow is gonna be
perfect for putting between your legs
walk sleeping oh yeah I mean I wouldn't
say that this is going to be better for
cuddling than Pilar but sometimes Tyler
please get scratched she wasn't against
the shade that's item number one so the
next thing I got was a little bit of a
maybe I could get this maybe I shouldn't
get this I got this plain black zip-up
sweatshirt I got it because it was nine
bucks and I thought that it's like a
basic that I would totally use and kind
of like schlep around the house in but
all you can kind of put it over like a
cute tight dress and make the tight
dress less like going out ish and more
like daytime ish so I have to do this
with a lot of my switchers I oftentimes
just grab the ends of my arm hold and
kind of just like stretch out the arms
just kind of like by holding them I do
know specifically that my wingspan is
almost identical to that of the turkey
vulture it is a soft jacket and
like this belt and got it so the next
thing I got was this black and gold
glittery camisole pink top type
situation
just from double-checking my receipt I'm
pretty sure that this thing went on sale
for like three dollars something about
it made me feel like I was like going to
go out which is a funny joke because I
don't do anything but I hang out with my
boyfriend in my cat but that's okay but
it was on sale and it was kind of stuff
good feeling and it was sparkly so I was
like let's go for it let's do this so
this is what the black and gold candy
looks like on another reason I like it
is because the straps are kind of far
apart from each other so you don't have
that weird thing sometimes we're like if
your straps are further in you can see
your bra strap or you can kind of get
this little like armpit moment you guys
know this armpit moment so I really like
how far apart the straps are in fact
that a cover is like this area
specifically I feel like I would
probably wear it with like black
high-waisted jeans and like some combat
boots you know just kind of smells
around I'll stomp around top for three
dollars ain't a bad deal to me so the
next thing is one of the more expensive
things that I bought I got this top this
top kind of like checks all the boxes
for me I'm like yes cold-shoulder black
ribs some texture to it and it was 14
bucks this is a black cold shoulder top
um I just love a good cold shoulder I
love shoulders
I think shoulder pads are kind of hot
and most of my arm hair is concentrated
on the lower arm so this way you just
get to see my kind of fuzzy shoulders
there's no way I could approach the
entire display of chokers about coming
away with a choker whatever they're like
a little motifs around I almost always
go for moons and stars I like that kind
of like a celestial vine who cut this
hump earth you're not going to get this
out so let me in
alright that's on I think the moon is
actually a little bit longer than I
anticipated the moon kind of hitting me
below my boob but I do love that kind of
like layered effect to me the layered
choker is very like Tudor England here's
my necklace here's my cross and here's
my smelling salt you know you've got
everything you need right here
I got three things from the hosiery
section so I'll just show them all
right now the first thing is these three
pairs of weather sensor finish opaque
types it says that they keep you warm
when it's cool and cool when it's warm I
don't know if that's true because that
seems like magic it just seemed like a
good idea to stock up for those days
where I just really don't want to shave
my legs the next thing I got were these
three pairs of cushion sole shoe liners
which I think just means socks it's been
USA sizes six to ten of which I am a
nine and a half ten club at the upper
end of the range you know they say about
long feet long thumb but they look kind
of long so I feel like we'll be able to
fit the old gal's in there and then the
last koshary thing I got are these HP
socks Harry Potter cozy socks
my motto is that you can never have too
much Harry Potter merchandise and I will
single handedly prove that motto correct
I think I forgot to say the tights are
six dollars the socks are four dollars
and the Harry Potter socks are 350 so
this is the most expensive thing that I
got it was 16 bucks and it is this
polyurethane skirt it's like a pleather
material so it has that kind of like
fabric e inside but sort of like leather
ish outside and there are pockets I want
you to kind of got like a little bit of
like a badass look but it's also got
kind of like a business casual look at
the same time is a little bit slippery
but I think it's kind of fun and going
to suck it in a little bit and you know
open up in my second to last thing that
I got are these PETA headlights they
were three dollars and I couldn't say no
to a cat I decided to get these I don't
know where I'm putting them yet I just
likes it a lot so it is battery-operated
and not something you plug into an
outlet so they do a little on/off switch
so you can just become drunk with power
you're just having a good time huh
so the very last thing I got because I
didn't want to go through the Primark
beauty section and not get anything at
all is this little flawless finish
concealer brush from PS look at the soup
for those are cheese brushes that look
like to pressures in pro your
I actually have a different view for
their toothbrushes that's a little bit
larger than this so I gots a really
small one this was 350 I can't say it
ever used a real our toothbrush I don't
know exactly what it feels like this one
it feels a little firm I think that's
kind of the point
if you don't think it could be good for
crevices all right so that's my haul and
my journey I do know what time argues
now and I'm very glad that I do feel
like I'll be able to watch Primark haul
with like the new sense of belonging
it's definitely a little more of an
outing it takes some effort to like look
through and shop there so I feel like
people do hauls of it and it's almost
like look at lively and by booty I mean
like loot but I think the effort is
worth it and I really like the socks
that I'm now wearing on my house for the
floors guys to see them my hands are
getting warm though thank you guys so
much for watching if you liked that
video make sure to select one and if you
want to see more videos like this make
sure to submit that's absque Rai button
and also make sure to submit that little
bell icon in the middle to turn on post
notifications you get a notification
every time I put here my social media
handles and make sure to check out my
next beat I do a lot of q and A's and
daily vlogging on there and I'm just
going to keep smacking my hands together
because then it makes the Harry Potter
scar unite into one and it's kind of
like a weird exercise and I'm kind of
doing it so you know some all day long
