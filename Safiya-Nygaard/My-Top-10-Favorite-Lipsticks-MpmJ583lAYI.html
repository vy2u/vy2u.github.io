friends and welcome to another video you
guys have been requesting a lipstick
collection video from me quite a bit and
I hear you and so today I'm here with a
video that it's not exactly the video
you asked for but it is similar today
I'm going to be showing you guys my top
10 favorite lipsticks of the movement
crusty will not be here for the whole
video because I'm pretty sure
very soon he's about to put his claw
either into my boob or my eye because it
seemed like about the trajectory that
I'm feeling from him just like who's one
Claudio o or origins who well we had it
for one take up once it's right here oh
you guys might know I'm something of a
lipstick fiend I feel like I have a
normal amount of other types of makeup I
just have a lot of lipsticks
so as you can imagine it was kind of
difficult for me to choose 10 lipsticks
to show you guys but I think I narrowed
it down to some winners there definitely
are other lipsticks that aren't on this
list that I really really love but these
are the lipsticks I think I wear the
most often someday soon I'm going to do
an entire lipstick collection video I
feel like I just need to get them a
little more organized before I do that
right now they're in kind of like a heap
not an incredibly disorganized heap like
a moderately organized heap but it's not
pretty
just a disclaimer before we get started
I am in no way a beauty expert or a
makeup artist I just really like
lipstick so a lot of my opinions are
just based on how I think they look and
how I think they feel and yes I will be
lip swatching every single one of these
for you guys so if you see like a red
ring around my mouth not really red I
feel like it turns red because of red
lipstick like any color other than the
lipstick that's on my lips it's just
from like the amount of removing and
reapplying happening hopefully not too
much chasing my cat a better view of my
ingrown hair coming in around the stash
area such as yeah it's just that kind of
day okay let's swatch I'm going to prep
my lips with this elf like lip scrub
stick there's little grains inside and
preacher the grains are sugar because
the grain disintegrate after a little
bit on your lip and if you're wondering
does this lip scrub taste good yes it
does it tastes pretty good alright
lipsticks number 10 wait wears lipstick
over 10
wait are my lipstick running away from
me lipstick number 10 this is the NYX
soft matte lip cream in London the soft
matte lip creams have a special place in
my heart I feel like these are one of
the first like liquid lipsticks that I
was introduced to and the funny thing is
like these are barely even liquid
lipsticks they're more as the title says
like lip cream but they're really
moisturizing and soft and they smell
great and they're just they're not as
intense so the cake batter honestly so
this is London I really love this kind
of like yellowy named color in my
experience I find that the nude lip
creams are a little bit better and I
like how soft it is and I just I have so
many soft matte lip creams but it's more
to show you guys one that I really love
the other reason I recommend a lighter
shade is to avoid the dreaded butthole
lips in my definition butthole lip is
when you're wearing lipstick and it
wears away or never exist on the inner
waterline of your lips and I have a very
active inner waterline of my lips but
whole lips plagues my life I feel like
that's why I go for a lot of liquid
lipsticks because I find that liquid
lipsticks just cling a little bit better
than normal lipsticks to the butthole
all right let's move on so number nine
is the colour-pop ultra satin lip in
offend I really love this color I
actually just wore this in the very end
of my Primark video it was kind of like
a grey purple I feel like I was afraid
of purple for so long because I drink a
lot of coffee so my feet can look kind
of yellow in certain lights so like for
a while is afraid of purple lipstick and
then I was like listen I'm just going to
lean into purple lipstick because I want
to wear a purple lipstick I feel like
the reason I end up eating a lot of
lipsticks is because I try and cover the
butt hole list in that instance I
actually touch my teeth with the
lipstick one but you don't even like I
go inside it's just part of my life like
I've just accepted it like I just ingest
a lot of lipstick so this is femme
I feel like this color is like a really
wearable purple like it's not just a
bright or kid purple this is like kind
of a muted dusty greyish color let's
move on to number eight so number eight
is the NYX liquid suede in Brooklyn form
smells like pretty much nothing oh my
gosh
no sir no this is the first of a few
brown that you're going to see I just
love brown lipstick I just think it's
fun and wearable and kind of Sundy this
show yeah it's kinda like a 90s look
like everyone's like 90s and I'm like I
was a child and I loved it I really
really love this color I think it's just
like a really fun gray brown like dirt
if I had to rename this color I would
call it dirt and worms I really love the
liquid suede I think it's a good
inexpensive liquid lipstick it doesn't
ever get like fully dried down really
matte I think it's comfortable I think
it's wearable I think it lasts a decent
amount I just keep the tube with me and
a little bit of concealer honestly just
to like fix anything if I decide to grub
or like do anything crazy just in case
alright so we're on to number seven and
my lips are already a little bit dry not
Sahara Desert dry but drawing
nonetheless
alright so number seven is the Urban
Decay matte lipstick in 1993 they don't
carry these capsules anymore but they
still carry this color now this one I
could not leave off my top 10 because I
use this a lot it is a matte lipstick
but in a real lipstick one of only two
like actual lipsticks that is in this
video I've had this since 2015 I know
that there's a time frame in which
you're supposed to throw out your
lipsticks but I never do unless it feels
bad a lot of times especially when I'm
using like a lipstick I will just on to
take my finger and kind of like wipe the
lipstick off the Cupid's bow instead of
lining my lips to them a little lazy I
just I really love this lipstick it's
pretty long wearing even though it's not
like a matte liquid lipstick it doesn't
really dry down to be super matte either
it's just like such a fun Brown I know
you guys are going to be like soft
you're too into brown lipsticks like I
just I love them I am that evil hermit
meme where normal Hermits like so wait
you already have ten lipsticks in this
color and evil Kermit's like but this
one has different under
this one does have different undertow
this one's a little more reddit like
it's a little more of a brick read
Brooklyn Thorne's a little more gray you
guys there a differences and they're
there are differences in the way the
tube looks all righty then
number six is the colour-pop ultra satin
lip in point zero this is the one I'm
using my everyday makeup routine I love
this color
I wear it all the time I really love the
color pop ultra satin lip
I like the max as well I think the ultra
satin lips are just more wearable
they're just less drying they're more
comfortable I don't been a sucker for
this ultra satin lip man this is point
zero it once again one of those gray G
Brown e-news and you know I just am a
sucker for them a beauty youtuber that I
watch who's really awesome named
kathleenlights
actually made this color in
collaboration with color pops and I love
it select shout out to Kathleen for
making a dope lipstick because this is a
great color alright number five this is
black moon cosmetics in this it is a
liquid lipstick it's a blackened
greenish metallic smells like cake
batter as well I definitely don't wear
it as much as I wear my new colors but
when I feel like wearing this thing I'm
just like ah last time I wore this
lipstick I named my look barb from the
upside down but it's also like kind of a
Grinchy look it can go festive if you
went like green lips red eyes kind of
like diamond festive it's also kind of a
Slytherin color I am a ravenclaw but
Slytherin is my secondary house I know
some people are adamantly against like
having like multiple houses but listen
if we're going to be Canon I went too
ill over Burnie anyway so this is miss
something about how dark and green and
metallic it is makes it look kind of
velvety I wouldn't say that this guy is
like a hundred percent transfer proof so
like if you're going to go out to eat
like definitely bring the tube with you
honestly for this color like I would
bring a lipstick tube anywhere number
four is the Too Faced melted matte
liquid lipstick in drop dead red I just
think it's a fun dramatic a deep wine
color this is one of the only like
classical matte formula that's in this
line up this one drive down to a true
math is really long-lasting it's
definitely kind of dry but it's clean
like it will stay on your face sometimes
I'm putting on a really matte lipstick
I'll smile and then like fill in the
crack just to keep everything smooth
this lipstick is kind of like came to
play you like not changes play like play
like came to slay you reminds me of kind
of old Hollywood Tower of Terror as tall
like a murderous woman lipstick number
three is the colour-pop ultra satin lip
in mess around this may be the ultimate
sathya not 1/4 brown lipstick so is this
the 10 most different lipsticks in the
world video no not really but I just
want to show you guys my absolute
favorites and I really do reach for this
one all the time so yeah this is mess
around because we're just messing around
with some lipsticks having a good time I
think this one's kind of subtle kind of
sexy kind of nudie it is often times in
my bag and once again this was the ultra
satin lip formula because I just love
that freakin formula and I could put
that on my face all day long that's not
sexual but I'm here for it so moving
right along to number two this is the
NYX liquid suede in the foul-mouth do if
you mouse clean it up with NYX liquid
plays it smells almost exactly like the
mr. sketch scented markers in licorice I
absolutely love this color I will wear
this color any day of the week it's a
really really deep navy purple like not
white navy blue not quite purple
somewhere in between almost like a deep
violet especially with these darker
colors you just want to cover the
butthole as much as possible it's kind
of like an Ursula look I just feel like
I'm chilling like a villain actually I
had to rename this lipstick it would
definitely be chillin like a villain
imagine like Plankton's evil laugh you
know like it's just more what with this
lipstick shade on you just have to like
use your diaphragm I feel like this is
one of my go-to dark shades I just loved
it enough for it to make it to number
two on this list not quite to number one
I feel number one might
prai's you guys honestly before we get
number one I have two honorable mentions
for you guys so honorable mention number
one is the Kylie lip kit in ginger I
love how the Kylie lip kit smells I
honestly smell like butter beer to me I
have a few Kylie lip kit just because I
has just so many of her makeups that I
just have a lot of that makeup she has
like eyeshadows and blushes eyeliners
and I still think that's an OG like
Kylie lip kit is her best product it's
very matte it's very long-lasting I
thought it goes with a lot of things I
feel like it's pretty universally
flattering to me it's kind of like if
pumpkin spice were a lipstick I feel
like there's a stigma around pumpkin
spice lattes and like I'm not saying I
support like pumpkin spice everything
like I remember there was a mean going
around a pumpkin buy tampons but I love
a good pumpkin spice latte may taste
amazing I don't care about the stigma I
just felt like the list might be
incomplete without one Kylie Lipkin
honorable mentions number two I don't
think I could make this video without
mentioning my favorite black actually
black dark at night lipstick because
sometimes you just need to go all the
way this is a Kat Von D everlasting
liquid lips I believe it's called yes in
which is the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks
kind of smell like Crayola Crayons which
doesn't deter me from wanting to chew on
them somehow
obviously like when you're going for a
black lipstick like they're all going to
be the same color the reason I go for
this one is tap on these lipstick are
definitely on the kind of like more
matte clinging side having like a true
matte black lipstick is just kind of
like sexier
I wouldn't necessarily want like a shiny
like patent leather black lipstick I
like this kind of like matte batmobile
color alright onto number one before I
tell you guys what my number one
favorite lipstick is I feel like I have
to reek lera Phi but these things are
like Oprah moment I can't say it's been
my favorite lipstick forever and
honestly had there have been times
before where I had other number-one
favorite lipsticks but I do love this
lipstick enough to give it the number
one sloth
it is the Urban Decay vice lipstick in
oblivion it's a gray purpley taupey
color this lipstick
was an accidental love i remember going
into sephora for a different Urban Decay
vice lipstick watching this one getting
kind of emotionally confused leaving
sephora walking around for a while with
the swatch and then just being like I
need this color in my light coming back
for it and just being like yet you're
coming home with me the reason it got to
be at the top of my list
besides the fact that I was just drawn
to it magnetically at Sephora is because
of how often I reach for this thing this
is another lipstick that just kind of
like lives in my bag like I take this
everywhere I feel like I can wear it
with any type of makeup look still a
cool color though it's also in everyday
color I really hope my application is
doing it justice right now because i
swatched so many things on my lips
tonight already that my lips are kind of
chapped and dying it takes a couple of
coats to get full coverage but it's just
so wearable it does have like a matte
finish but it's not super matte I just
I'm a big fan so those are my top 10
favorite lipsticks at the moment well
kind of top 12 because I snuck in those
two honorable mentions so top 12
favorite lipsticks at the moment I
really hope you guys enjoyed that video
I hope you guys didn't mind too much
when Mike watching kind of like
decreased in quality a lipstick after
lipstick a day will come when I will
make an entire lipstick collection video
and I'll show you guys
hopefully my then improved storage
situation I kind of want those things
that help the lipstick stand up by
themselves but then I was just kind of
need like bleachers of lipsticks you
know I would kind of need like stairs of
those but I hope you guys like that
anyway I'm glad I could share part of my
lipstick addiction with you guys I would
love to hear more about your guys's
favorite lipsticks I don't need to be
enabled necessarily but I just like to
