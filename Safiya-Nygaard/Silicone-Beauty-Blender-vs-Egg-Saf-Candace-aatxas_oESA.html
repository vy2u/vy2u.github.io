hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm here with Candace and
we're going to be testing out another
strange dupe so recently there have been
a few videos of people blending out
their foundation with hard-boiled eggs
using them like beauty blenders we also
have the Eevee blender here today which
is a silicone makeup sponge and it is
like basically just the same shape as
like a Beauty Blender with like a little
divot in the front so nobody said that
the eggs was a dupe for the ebee blender
the easy blender is a silicone makeup
sponge that doesn't absorb any product
when you blend out your makeup in theory
the hard-boiled egg used as a makeup
sponge is supposed to do a similar thing
and not absorb any product so Candace
and I are going to see if this could be
a dupe this beauty hack is just in time
for Easter and also just in time for
lunch it's smelling kind of sulfur over
here because you've got three
hard-boiled eggs that we just made yeah
so now I can comfortably fire and nobody
will know even though the easy blender
had some texture on the outside and the
egg is pretty smooth toning it either if
you've already know this one's a little
more pointed than the egg but both of
them recall of UD blenders
I'm really interested to see how this
will work so we're going to do one half
of our face in the egg and one half an
EB blender and I would say maybe how
about left side a brighter side Phoebe
they say apply about half of the amount
of makeup you normally would use with a
phone sponge the EB blender is best for
liquid cream or gel makeup you can even
use to apply lipstick what yeah okay so
basically what you do is you blend the
makeup onto your skin by first swiping
the product and then bouncing the
product by swipe then bounce it
definitely feels more just like a hard
Beauty Blender mm-hmm I can feel the
like curve off so I don't know if that's
just for holding on to the product I
think that it's actually blending pretty
quick it's not that slow I know it or it
does hurt a little bit just cause like
it's just not soft it is not absorbing
any of the product I have like a ton
left on my hand I really appreciate the
shape of the pits though yeah it can
really
get in the crevasse because the problem
I had when it's be still fund was that
there wasn't the ability to get under
your eyes and in all that area and it
was just kind of like we had to fold it
up it does have a little bit less of
that a suspicious flapping sound oh that
was bad I'm gonna over here sue me like
ah stop what are you doing in there I
don't know if you're noticing this at
all my foundation is really matched
right now hmm sometimes I feel wet after
application with the field knife yeah I
watched Nicki tutorial video and she was
saying that like this thing made her
skin really Drive if you're like really
oily skin maybe this could be really
good I have combo skin so I thought for
some parts of my face this is gonna be
great
and for other parts it's like overall I
made the cover just be good all right so
this side is my I don't know why it
looks so yellow on camera it's my aged
parchment color of this foundation I
just look like an old piece of papyrus I
feel like in general it's just very
matte yeah I actually like that it's not
super like you me looking you can all
about the do meanest back in you know
what I also like about stuff like this
is that it's probably really easy to
clean okay um so it's any time take your
pick and I was like wipe some moisture
all OOP should I get a paper towel so
I'm just looking for trouble
Candice is just becoming one with the
egg all right so we have our egg and
we're going to go my Spanish like
dripping on my hand I'm really won't
look boom it's kill something oh you
don't like that I feel like I'm being
licked by a cold dog like a dog what
nose is pressing into me okay so I'm
gonna try the same thing where it's like
mirror
oh and bail off the bat this is kind of
like sitting on top yeah babe yes
definitely sweater I do really love the
way the egg feels on my face though like
it's cooling okay
um never done enjoyable the initial
swipe was like this is just sitting on
top of my face and now it's blending a
little bit more the thing that the
these lenders got that this eggs don't
got is the point you could really get in
the crevice in like a great way I don't
mind the job it's doing with the
foundation but I'm doing the crevices of
my finger at this point it's so much
softer and it's not a dip I mean I
actually don't think I'm using that much
product and it doesn't look like it's
soaking up too much yeah I like the
rolling action I can you Oh Oh No okay
this is my EB Blender side and this is
my egg side with the assistance of a
couple of fingers you can't really see a
line down the middle of my face it kind
of looks like both sides are pretty
similar
Evie blender egg blender I think you can
tell a little bit on this side that
there's like almost a little more
product
I think the Evie blender packs it on a
little more yeah when I'm looking at
like the details of my face this was
much more detail-oriented yeah that
could go on its resume I think that
getting in the crevice is a huge plus
for the Evie blender the egg is nicer
feeling on your face by a lot like I
really love the way the egg filled is
cool it kind of soft if you can
duplicate this feeling means don't take
that idea there is a lot of product left
on my hand so I think both were pretty
good at not absorbing Prada yeah I don't
know who's the winner here though I
think for me it's the Evie Wonder I
would use the PD blender just because I
have a little more oily skin I think
that I'm going to have to give it to the
egg well for a product that never asked
to be a Beauty Blender the egg did a
damn good job like the egg was like
listen this was not my destiny you took
me off course sure I'll blend your
makeup out and do a pretty good job in
terms of and everyday use like an actual
product
I think the Evie blender has to win yeah
but in terms of like this one-on-one
takedown match I think the egg the egg
has some advantages you no need to put
up a very good fight like it was
underdog status the incredible edible
egg we wash off the eggs throw a lot of
makeup on up things there's some makeup
can you see that right there just you
guys know like I don't think foundation
is very good to eat health wise so maybe
don't do this at home
but what does feeling great a
stomachache I can't taste the foundation
okay there you go
maybe you can wash it off and eat a
doctor
maybe it'll pan do it all I think that
this is actually a pretty successful
test one might say an egg-cellent - I
hope you guys enjoyed that video let me
