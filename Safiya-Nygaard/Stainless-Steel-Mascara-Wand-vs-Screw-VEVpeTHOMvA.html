what went hello friends and welcome to
another video today I'm going to be
trying out another strange dupe that
nobody really asked me to try a few
months ago a makeup company called
hourglass came out with a stainless
steel mascara wand I think the idea
behind a stainless steel mascara wand is
that there's no bristles so you can't
really get clumps on it so this is the
our black curator lash instrument excuse
me for calling it a mascara wand it
looks like a very discreet adult toy of
some kind and then at the end there are
these little divots and acident thing
came out I saw a few youtubers do videos
about it and a lot of the comments were
rightfully upset at the price of it the
mascara wand is $78 and the lash primer
and mascara that they sell to go
specifically with that mascara wand are
thirty-six dollars each I also saw a
decent amount of comments who suggested
using a screw instead of this mascara
wand so what did I do you guys I went to
Home Depot and I bought a couple screws
I never thought that I would be heading
to Home Depot to find a mascara wand but
that's what we're doing today I mean
it's bigger than no crunch so let's see
if we can find one that's making similar
people and they're kind of wide because
of course they are actual screws it's
not perfect this are yeah okay I was
honestly very intrigued by the products
begin with I was even more intrigued
when the idea of using a screw came up
because it kind of seems like it would
work oh this is like pretty good almost
like this kind of similar thickness not
quite as tightly coiled the pre-close
machine screws number eight thirty two
by one and a half for number six thirty
two by one and a half got my mascara
long I'm gonna have to figure out how to
clean these things I'm excited you know
this is the first makeup haul ever out
of Home Depot now I just want to say
that I'm not necessarily recommending
you do this at home I am taking on the
risk personally to put a screw near my
eyeball I don't want you to do this and
poke your eye out I'm going to do less I
screw right eye mascara wand let's do
this thing
start off with a lash instrument it
seems like the lash instrument is the
one bringing this metal mascara wand
thing to the table I got my lash primer
I have my mascara wand oh my god it's
like a little hat so you can screw the
lash instrument right into the primer
and I suppose the mascara as well kind
of turning it into this like very pointy
dangerous normal mascara to mix it
around I guess
looks like lotion on the mascara wand
I'm going to put this primer on my
lashes it doesn't really look like much
is going on it looks oh I can see like a
little bit of gray or white flecks at
the end of my lashes
looks like dandruff why does this always
happen to me alright so I'm just going
to go in the same stuff and put on my
bottom lashes it's a little bit
disconcerting to put this thin stainless
steel thing like right next to your eye
so I'm excited to get to that crew
here's the lash primer try and shake it
around shimmy it around if I get some
fire on there you know Oh yep jackpot
once again it looks a lot like lotion
the one thing about this screw is that
the divots are not quite as close
together as on the curator lash
instrument little free clothes
I was completely filed there because I
was so nervous I think it is actually
applying it reasonably well obviously
with the lash instrument you have that
fun weapon effect with this you kinda
just got like a shake weight effect oh
my god oh my god I almost touch my eye
oh my god wait be careful with those
things guys be careful okay awesome this
is my crew eye and this is my curator
eye it's not exactly the same but it's
getting the general idea down the screw
it's not winning but it's not losing yes
let's talk to the mascara now back to
the lash instrument I do absolutely love
the look of this thing when it's all
screwed together it's like quick
there we go the end is covered in
mascara hmm
okay I've never used lash primer before
and I wonder if I did something wrong
it's just it looks very spidery it looks
like Charlotte is you know trying to
help me out she's trying to write a
message in the lash bottom lashes are
not about the bottom lashes look pretty
normal
okay I'm going to show you guys up close
don't you think it was kind of spidery
like a black widow baby the bottom
lashes look pretty nice does this end at
the top lashes kind of like going
everywhere I'm putting the curator back
in its holster and I'm going in with the
screw the last instrument has a long
handle and this has no handle so I am
about to get mascara all over my hand in
fact it's already happened it's pretty
well coated so though mm-hmm I'm going
to go in for the bottom lashes
I don't know about this you guys I kind
of expected the stainless steel to
really separate all the lashes like
almost just give everything a thin
coating but it's kind of clumpy er that
I expected this is the lash instrument
size and this is the screw size actually
looking at it up close it's not that bad
but it's just it's not really what I
expected in terms of comparing the screw
to the lash instrument I think this
screw did pretty well
it's the lash instrument is definitely a
little bit better at separating but it's
not that much better after looking at it
for a little while I'm definitely
impressed by the lengths to which my
lashes have been brought they're very
long right now they would definitely hit
up against my glasses if I were wearing
my glasses just because I am a little
bit of a stickler about the whole clumpy
last thing I'm going to take this off
and just like a mascara on and we're
going to see if it looks any better ten
minutes later I returned this stuff is
does not come out very easily but I
think I got it all off okay I think I
already liked the look of it without the
primer better let's just do this crew
really quick where's my screw whoo whoo
and hocus-pocus she goes boom blue there
it is so this is the effect without the
lash primer I actually like it better I
think it looks a little bit less spidery
I think the screw is a little clumpy er
the curators a little finer but spread
decent the curator is a bit finer with
it
it so it can separate the lashes a
little better I didn't think that it was
that much finer but you can kind of tell
the difference though to be fair a pack
of these two screws is a dollar eighteen
and the curator lash instrument is
seventy eight dollars so I think with
that price difference I would say that
the screw did pre damn well this crew
never asked to be a mascara wand but she
served me well today in terms of
generally using a metal mascara wand I
think the effect is pretty I think it's
decent I don't think I like this more
than my normal better than sex little
mini mascara that I use I think I'm
probably going to stick with that but I
felt that bad and the screw did pretty
well
is this a dupe or a bad idea I think
that this is both a pretty good dupe and
also probably a bad idea you know into a
bad idea doesn't mean it didn't work I
think it's just like should you put a
screw near your eye I don't know it just
seemed like it could end badly I hope
