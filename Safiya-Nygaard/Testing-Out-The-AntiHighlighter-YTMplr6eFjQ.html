video today I'm going to be trying out
an anti highlighter now I say anti
highlighter because that is what it has
been called by many many articles
articles have been calling it the anti
highlighter that matches your cold dark
soul a new black highlighter that
matches your cold dark soul so this is
the product that everyone's been talking
about so it is an inner glow cream
pigment in the color Eclipse by richland
if you I don't know why I went like kind
of Italian ask at the end it's a French
name I'm pretty sure I just Spanish
throughout school so like I do not know
how to pronounce any cosmetic names are
in French they just all go over my head
according to Google this is how you
actually say it so I was completely
wrong people kept using the word
highlighter to describe this product
this black cream highlighter is the
perfect product for makeup wearers who
don't like shimmer but what about your
black highlighter the black highlighter
of your goth dream so I'm going to try
and use this in the way I would use my
normal highlighter there are also
instructions on the brand website as to
recommendations of how to actually use
it so I'm going to also try their
directions afterwards I just want to see
why everyone was calling it a
highlighter I'm being incredibly extra
and wearing my choker from Halloween my
Morticia Addams choker and I felt like
if they were bringing the darkness I
wanted to also bring the darkness also
bringing the darkness here today on my
stream life there's one string that's
just out I'm very sad about it but
clearly they also dress for the occasion
because there's less light in here than
usual all right here we go on my finger
it looks like a really dark purple cloth
place it on my arm on camera it looks
kind of brownish it also looks like a
bruise so when I usually put highlighter
on I usually put highlighter on like a
little bit right here
sometimes a DAB on the nose you almost
always under my brow bone
then definitely like right here on the
cheekbone I'm going to start with like
under my brow bone the funny thing is at
first when I put it on it looks just
like like such and then as I rub it in
it almost disappears is it giving me a
highlighted effect no but on the blend
if I blend it out a little bit it's like
oh I don't really know exactly what
that's about but on the side that I
blended it out it is just kind of like a
shadowy kind of Morticia s it looks kind
of good under my brow bone putting it
somewhere where you would put
highlighter you could wear it there I
think I don't think it looks crazy so
next up I'm going to put it on my
cheekbone clearly that didn't that
didn't work out for me it's just like a
it's just get mark it's a dark B mini
skin mark glowing after a few bounces
it's kind of becoming something I don't
know that it even looks like witchy and
fun I think it kind of just looks like I
smudged something there is a glossiness
to it so it does kind of reflect a
little bit if I just move my head around
like this forever I'm going to do it on
the other side too just so we can have a
full face full face of anti highlight
this side lets you looks a bit a little
bit better but both sides like at the
end just getting stuck in all she cares
look I look like Dick Van Dyke from Mary
Poppins just dancing on a roof in London
okay so the next place I would put a
highlighter would be my nose the tip of
my nose like says that just made me look
like a cat or reindeer like a very very
uncommitted Halloween costume I'm a
mouse duh the thing is like I am into it
on my eyes like I actually do like it
there and then we got down to the middle
of the face and it was just like where
if you does a highlighter right now it
doesn't really make any sense the last
place I would put highlight is like
right in my Cupid's bow oh let's put
some right there yeah it kind of just
looks like I shaved my mustache but
forgot the Cupid's bow and that's not
necessarily the look I'm going for
or still I don't know about that one you
guys to be fair change
you didn't call it the anti highlighter
they're just like this is just a cool
cream pigment that you can use and
people were like aha an anti highlighter
they say that eclipse is a black blush
contour cream eyeshadow and lipstick so
that's what it's nice I guess by anti
highlight maybe you could mean that it's
supposed to be literally everything
except the highlight but that was not
clear okay so I'm going to start with
the eye shadow I'm just going in as my
finger that's kind of cool
alright so this is what it looks like as
an eye shadow I do have a shadow primer
under here it does have that kind of
weird sister vibe to it they say you can
use it as blush and contour so I don't
really know what else to use with this
for contour except for my finger and
then I'll blend it out with a Beauty
Blender oh those are not even on both
times
oops whatever limiting leave you
wondering just tried actually it kind of
works okay this side I'm doing a worse
job on how it's up my left side of
struggling today you guys I didn't
execute this that well but this is like
the Maleficent look this is the dark
look they were talking about and it's
kind of cool I don't think it's like an
everyday look but it could be an every
night look miss my speaking area let's
see what we can do with a cheek with a
with a blush that I really need already
okay I'm not sure about this one I guess
if you put it on like super super sheer
maybe you can just get the purple out of
it but this time the left side did way
better I don't know what when I do to my
right side now I don't know if I would
use it as as blush but like I think I
understand it a little bit more than
just like the highlight right here so
the last thing that it says it can do is
be a lipstick I've been wanting to put
this on my lips not on my Cupid's bow
like a little Rhett Butler moustache but
on my lips oh oh yeah I had to work it
into my waterline to make sure their
butthole was covered it's covered a
little bit better now it's a really
interesting blotted look
into it it is kind of moving around my
lips so and to put it back on so it will
go anywhere does this make sense as a
lip color yeah I like this as a lip
color in fact as I'm looking at
everything like the blush is kind of
settled in a little bit more it kind of
makes sense so I think that like you can
use this for the things that it says you
can use it for insisting a black
highlighter in my opinion no is this
thing the anti highlighter only in that
like a product that is not highlighter
could be anti highlighter I actually
think that referring to this as a
highlighter it's pretty confusing
of course calling it the anti
highlighter could be getting more people
to talk about it but if you're talking
about it and titling it in a headline in
a way that's just confusing the buzz
might be working against it cuz I think
it's kind of a cool product it has a
cool effect but an anti highlighter it
is not thank you guys so much for
