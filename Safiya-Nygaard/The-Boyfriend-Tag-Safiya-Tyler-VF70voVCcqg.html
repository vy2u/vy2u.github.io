be about cat herpes yeah before you know
hello friend and welcome to the first
video on my revamped channel well today
we're going to be doing the boyfriend
tag with my boyfriend this is Tyler my
boyfriend boyfriend
where's Krusty he's also my boyfriend
he's Austrian but in a very platonic
she's breathing heavy if you hear heavy
breathing it's our tad as you spin
around
he's been around that yeah you got
herpes
yeah your cat is cat herpes that kind of
compromises their immune systems and
they get a little cold in the mix nor at
night when they sleep right above your
face anybody the boyfriend tag is like a
really really old tag video basically
just a series of questions that we
answer and it's like about our
relationship and they're not we're not
playing against each other no we're not
me thank you
yes so this is not just 20 questions
interview Tyler it actually kind of is
up I'm Bob Walker this paradigm not read
okay it's still a relevant reference
people know about Walters no no are all
over Instagram is lit nearly enough I
don't know I'm feel like Barbara Walters
snapchat is off the hook that gets like
Kylie Jenner Barbara Walters I actually
cannot conjure an image of Barbara
Walters lips in my mind voters but I
probably buy a lip kiss from her let's
be honest I think we should get into it
cuz there are a lot of questions out
roses boyfriend tag question number one
where did we meet this is actually an
interesting question is an interesting
question so we went to college together
so we did not date in college no but we
knew each other we were not edited we we
were not enemies either but I really
enemies no we ran out of sauce hesitated
so then we re met in LA and a couple of
years later two years after he had
graduated and just after I grabbed and I
was like your first night out in LA
right basically because we had some
mutual friends from Tyler's acapella
first yeah Tyler wasn't aqua pal
bro our fake head song was everybody
pees in the shower
this town is a good song actually it
sound crazy but it's a good song it's
also true tag question number two where
was our first yeah our first date
okay here's there's another tricky
question it's a point of contention end
of our courtship the start of a
relationship it's a light on specific
details what you do I think that we were
friends for a few months and then we
transition it is friendzone to me i
friend-zoned her Tyler invited me to
Disneyland I did one on one it was not
supposed to do but I interpreted it as
the thing they said and I had a great
time over the time I was waiting for him
to make some sort of move it was here in
the physical sense I was waiting for him
to kiss me eyes when there were many
opportunities and he did not take them
and then when he dropped me off at home
afterwards I was waiting for him to lean
for the 15 he didn't and I was like
mildly offended here's what I didn't
want to use Disney for the powers of
evil you're leveraging the nostalgia and
the magic for the pickup so I didn't
want to do that obviously just means
like a really intense first date anyway
because it's like the way we do it it's
like a 10 hours a day then I went to
dinner like five days later how is our
birthday for real so then we had our
first okay but I'm never going to live
down that it and make a move at
Disneyland yes mhm alright tag question
number three okay what was your first
impression of me real first impression
was just how easy it was is it always
has been to talk to you thanks me the
first impression I think like last like
two and a half weeks yeah right and over
to another which tells us like while we
can talk about everything
and then there's like one night where we
just like sat outside of your apartment
and just talked to like 4 or 5 a.m. yeah
and it was like dolls older soul friends
my first impression of Tyler in college
I mean here's the thing is like we were
acquaintances in college that I really
know you but I thought that you were
like a cool guy so
was my a screen name back in the day
really was who that teacher tonight
when we re met in LA I also thought you
were really needed to talk to
implementing out with and so that's what
I thought right off the bat and I also
thought that he was into me I mean was I
wrong no you were right do I have any
weird obsession if so what Tyler just
loves geography and look geo-locating
you like swing two things and being like
that's it Sofia is obsessed with sausage
like legitimately not obsessed it's
awesome one thing you put together like
a beautiful turkey sandwich so I take
that turkey sandwich it's going to put
barbecue sauce and plate and then dip it
or hot sauce without fail it's good
monster
yeah I'm really into sauce to the saw
drill I might consider myself a
crosshead how long we've been together
at this point I think it's a two and
half years we're not here so there you
go do you have a tradition with your
girlfriend boyfriend uh tradition
communiques position yeah we go to a
Disney win every year after our first
non date at Disneyland every year on
anniversaries constantly so I feel like
that's our probably our biggest
tradition meant to be
I just did my job if he's hoping wait I
didn't try to knock down a Lord of the
Rings Ewing for every 10 years she's
Betty I did it I'm sorry oh no how are
you good Oh what was the first thing you
noticed about me I feel like these
questions are kinds of things yeah there
are a lot of like first glances saw them
across the room and you were like Robin
Scherbatsky I love you what is my
favorite restaurant
your favorite restaurant yeah BB go oh
yeah right there then your Z you go to
yeah I don't remember not challenging
that you're good at it we go challenge
it's pretty nice until you know what BB
go is it is a Capote style and not you
like pick you know the things that go in
it good restaurant that is like Korean
bibimbap or like barbecue stuff it's
really really really good really tasty
and it's at the mall if you want some BB
go let's go to the MA what do we argue
about the most
I don't know necessarily what we argue
about but we often argue when we see
that the other person is dressed it's
usually because I'm like I know that
you're stressed because you have gone to
the gym in like two weeks go to the gym
they're like I want to and what's cool
yeah yeah controversial who wears the
pants in the relation
now I actually will say that neither of
us we're pets very often I wear gym
shorts I were a lot of leggings so
whether you're on the leggings are pants
or not pants train I guess that's up to
you
if I'm watching TV what am i watching
what are you watching or what we're
watching I think that do we watch things
separately if you're watching something
without me I mean I hate to say sports
because I probably like to watch sports
but it's probably for you don't like to
watch sports with me you're just you're
too hard for you something it to be as
like actually watching it doesn't really
fall into like the sweet spot of what
we're both
it's always going to be like British
dramas about the monarchy yes yes so
it'll be like rain or will be like the
crown will be like the Tudor so it's
Downton Abbey also up your after Alex
and Abbey is up my alley yes that's true
we're walking together is usually How I
Met Your Mother a Gordon Ramsay show the
office Parks and Rec food truck road
trip Game of Thrones that kind of stuff
what is one food I don't like Tyler
doesn't like shrimp or seafood you don't
like the tendons of meat I only like
meat if I can't figure out it's me from
like the texture of it yeah you don't
like eating things from the bone is
everything that is you don't like
anything up what drink do I order when
we go out to eat I know what you are
what is it Tyler will order an Arnold
Palmer Arnold Palmer's Rock any kind of
weekend lemonade strawberry lemonade
raspberry money pink Lebanese after
sauce if she can a hibiscus fur ginger
soda like a key like a fancy soda like
those are favorites like if it kind of
an earthy feel to it yeah that stuff
like the fact Oh drink what size shoe do
I wear
what cuz shoes what size what size shoes
you are at men 10 stop where the money
tends to no I don't
whatever is I can wear her shoes that I
do wear her sandals a lot
I actually got complimented for wearing
her shoes in the elevator the other day
because he was wearing cool shoes a guy
and I shoes us you to go there my
girlfriend and their sandals what is my
favorite kind of sandwich
this is place called hot bellies that
sells toasted sandwiches that stop love
they serve like a turkey melt sandwich
with mushrooms on it and like that is
soft goat cheese you love mushrooms on
sandwiches she loves Turkey on
sandwiches that they're melted even
better when do jalapeno as well right
hot peppers yeah did I know it or felt
pretty good what's one Talent
have you basically a cat whisperer he's
not a cat psychic like they don't like
communicate with cats but he's very good
at having cat come right up to him stuff
is fantastic and knowing when to cut an
avocado open I'm awful at it I never
know when to open up an avocado when to
cut it it's a fantastic Talent
go eat green Zoey's delicious a
teammate's really really good on the
contrary actually you update it thank
you that's a means a lot to me
yeah what is my favorite cereal I think
we're Tyler it is frosted mini proper
mini we great go to cereal I also think
that Tyler is really good at eating
cereal quickly and frosted mini-wheats
is one that gets soggy if you leave it
out gotta go fast
exactly I would say that the theater
material is going to be Lucky Charms
it has to be lucky charm absolutely and
I'm also the kind of person who eats all
the cereal forget about it and leave the
marshmallows to the end you got the
personality tag soft has the patient
it's kind of like people who bite
through the 50 roll and people that can
suck to the trick you all right yeah I I
bite immediately what is my favorite
music zombies all into the late 90s
early 2000 alternative rock I feel like
my favorite artists are like Britney
Spears and me Tyler's favorite kind of
music I would say absolute classic yeah
definitely we listen to a lot of
different kinds of things we have a big
overlap you like Little Mix the Beatles
yeah
blink-182 yeah no we have a really wide
spectrum and I like classic rock the
most but I wasn't anything what is my
favorite sports cake what is your
favorite sports team Tyler's favorite
sports team are the Philadelphia 76ers
in Philadelphia equal so it's a process
well that's what it 76 we use that's why
your favorite athlete right now enjoying
beat John B is really funny I applaud
him in his quest to save Rihanna yeah
seems like we shy and I hope that he you
know gets to go on a date with her
Sophia's favorite sports team probably
is the Chicago Blackhawks yes what is my
eye color
Brown these are brown to brown what is
something you do that I wish you did it
I like to start tasks late at night
because I'm nervous
yeah I know that is very true it's Tyler
getting tired and it's like a little bit
late and I'll be like wait let's just
like do one more load of laundry yeah
wait let's just like clean this up
really good I feel like I'm always
nervous about the things that happen
tomorrow
so I'm like oh if we could only like do
this one last thing it was really help
and Tyler's like go to sleep you're
doing so much if there's one thing that
I do that makes Athiya doesn't want me
to do it's probably that I can get
really in my head and then once I get
there it's hard to kind of break through
and reason with me what I was going to
say or that I wish that you didn't leave
your socks or okay that was amazing
actually is where am i from
Tyler is from the suburbs of
Philadelphia it gives a hair under stops
in Chicago she had bad eyes what kind of
cake would you bake me on my birthday I
think that I would have to go for a
cheesecake cheesecake yeah that's
totally my guilty pleasure if I could
bake this it would be challenging it
would be a vegan chocolate cake whenever
we go to sprinkles I always get the
vegan red velvet cupcakes I'm not vegan
but I didn't love it because they have
so much coconut oil in it it's so moist
I just love how moist the cake is this
is moist oh wow yeah last question y'all
the boyfriend tag almost over yeah Wow
anyways if I could live anywhere where
would it be
are we talking about this universe
because it is a real answer is Hogwarts
yes I think we're talking about in this
what time okay then I would say New York
City if Tyler could live anywhere it
would probably be somewhere where he
could have a big ring or like a cabin
you know you look really good in a
flannel so make me help you like much
way you like me and flannels yeah
