video
no this isn't a neck brace this is on
purpose a little while back some of you
guys suggested this choker too nice for
my wearing ugly stuff for a week series
and while it definitely does qualify as
a questionable fashion decision and it's
also quite uncomfortable it got me
thinking how did the choker come so far
so I thought why not skip wearing it for
a week and instead do a brief
exploration into the history of the
choker necklace I don't know that I'll
be able to explain this but the choker
does have a very long history the word
choker when talking about this kind of
necklace originated in the 1920s in
relation to flappers who are known to
rock a choker or two but this type of
tightly fitted necklace worn around the
throat has been in and out of fashion
since pretty much the beginning of human
civilization itself we are at the Met
Museum in New York right now
checking out some ancient choker yes
we're going to see we design around the
world and throughout history jewelry has
been believed to have amulet powers and
religious significance providing
spiritual protection from harm literal
protection from attack and protection in
the afterlife
I mean when you think about all the
places that jewelry is commonly worn
they are all kind of like vain heavy and
somewhat vulnerable places like wrists
neck chest heads people wore jewelry
including chokers for protective reasons
all the way back to some of the earliest
known civilizations in Mesopotamia one
of the earliest known chokers was found
in the burial sites of Queen puabi in
the ancient Akkadian city of Earth she
was buried with her jewelry so she could
bring their protective powers with her
into the afterlife she had a lot of it
and her chokers are dated as old as 2600
BC the ancient Egyptians wore jewelry in
general to resemble their gods and earn
their favor in particular they were
layered necklaces and collars made of
gold which represented the skin of their
Sun God raw in Bronze Age Europe Celtic
noble men and women also took to
dressing like their gods who were
depicted wearing neck ring they wore
these chokers for protective powers they
also look very uncomfortable almost as
uncomfortable as this thing it almost
feels like a headband oh it's tight it's
tight it only comes in one size Oh God
you loose miss thing I think it's the
least they can go which it was I would
die I think I would die I would take
your teletig neck ring over that so yeah
I think st. are you to wear that for a
week oh I'm just gonna like get like
some other interesting instances in
which people wore chokers for protection
include noble women in the Middle Ages
who wore chokers with Saint Sebastian
pendants on them to ward off the bubonic
plague the Middle Ages a tough time for
medicine many different Native American
tribes wore chokers made out of the
bones of birds whose spirits they
believed would help ward off all kinds
of sicknesses
but the children would also literally
protect the wearer's throat from attack
during battle so it was a double whammy
so protection was a big reason why
people wore chokers the neck was pretty
vulnerable medicine was pretty bad
whether it was coming from raw or bird
bones we could all use some good mojo at
some point like with all jewelry Chopra
it became more than just protective
amulet they also became fashion and over
thousands of years chokers have come in
and out of style with nobles and Royals
around the world one of the most iconic
historical chokers to me is Anne Boleyn
pearl monogrammed necklace like this one
I'm wearing right now in this painting
she's wearing a few different necklaces
like a lot of choker wearers she's going
for that layered effect I don't know if
people still thought chokers were meant
to protect the neck but they might have
stopped thinking that after her there
are also some really cool illustrations
of jewelry that was worn during the
Mughal Empire in India both men and
women were often dripping in jewels at
least for the paintings and if you were
going to be dripping in jewels you had
to start as high as possible right at
the neck this is an illustration of the
wife of Shah Jahan Mumtaz Mahal who
death later inspired her husband to
build the famous Taj Mahal as a tomb for
her chokers were of course also present
in one of the most famously opulent
times for aristocrats late baroque or
rokoko era France now this brings us to
Marie Antoinette who like Ann also wore
chokers and also lost her head which
partially started this next trend
wherein people started wearing chokers
as symbols during the French Revolution
some people wore red ribbons around
their neck to remember those who had
lost their heads at the guillotine
during the same time some British
teenagers also adopted the red ribbon
trend to make fun of the French and
their revolution and we think dis tracks
are savage later in 19th century France
black ribbons worn around the neck
became a symbol of prosecution the
Ã©douard Manet's Olympia shortly
afterwards also in France
ballerina started wearing similar black
ribbon choker as depicted in Edgar Degas
paintings of ballerina interestingly at
the time dancers and prostitutes faced
some of the same social stigma another
instance in which chokers were worn to
signify allegiance to a movement was
during the Great Depression in America
where wearing a plain black woven choker
or ribbon could be a signal of secret
lesbianism now those are all examples of
very simple choker of having symbolic
meanings but the extremely intricate
beaded necklaces of the Messiah and Zulu
people in Africa also carry a hidden
meaning different colored beads mean
different things and bees are chosen
carefully to convey the status and
intentions of the wearer social status
marital status etc chokers obviously
were also used to cover up or disguise
next stuff that one didn't want others
to see for instance in Germany and
Austria in the mid 19th century women
living in the Alps used to wear chokers
made of multiple rows of chains called
croquettes to hide lumps and swelling
around the throat from a common disease
called goiter one of the most famous
choker wearers in history is rumored to
have worn her chokers for a similar
reason in 1863 Prince Edward of England
married Princess Alexandra of Denmark
who freaking loved choker it's
unconfirmed but the widely accepted
rumor is that Alexandra started wearing
chokers to cover up a childhood scar on
her neck at the time England was
searching for some new fashion
inspiration as their current Queen
Victoria had been wearing mourning
clothes for years so when the new
Princess was seen wearing army pants and
flip-flops
I mean chokers everyone else started
wearing them too even her mother-in-law
Queen dress to depress Victoria
Alexandra's wide sweeping trend of the
late 1800s lasted through the Art
Nouveau period at the turn of the
century and into the art deco and
flapper age of the nineteen twenty and
in the 1940s Alexandra's chokers then
called dog collar necklaces came back
into fashion amongst young women so
Alexandra supposes scar launched a trend
that sold thousands upon thousands of
necklaces over like 80 years like I said
army pants a flip-flop after a brief
stint in the 40s chokers didn't really
come back until the sick
sieze and the 70s when chokers were worn
by quite a few male rockstars as an
element of gender-bending fashion Mick
Jagger Jimi Hendrix Elvis David Bowie
and Iggy Pop among others all wore them
though in earlier times and in some
parts of the world chokers has been
considered a gender-neutral item in 20th
century America dudes wearing chokers
were somewhat subversive but with the
sexual revolution of the 60s everything
was changing long hair bell-bottoms and
chokers could be for everyone especially
if you are a rock star chokers were once
again donned by male music and pop
culture icons in the night when chokers
worn by Gwen Stefani and posh spice were
also worn by lenny kravitz prince and
jared leto aka Jordan Catalano so that
brings us to basically when my memory
begins in the 90s simple dark chokers
were a signature of the goth or grunge
girl look of the early 90 but was more
widely adopted as the decade went on
with everyone from fashion victim amber
to Winona Ryder - Britney Christina and
Princess Diana adopting the trend and
who could forget the iconic stretchy
plastic tattoo choker
which let you wear what looks like the
popular barbed wire or tribal band
tattoos from the 90s around your neck
though the choker style stuck around
through the 2000s think Paris Hilton and
puka shell necklaces I say 90s fashion
in general began its resurgence in 2014
and 50 and with it the choker came back
with a vengeance from the simple plastic
and ribbon chokers of the 90s to the
tall stacked and luxurious chokers of
Victorian England of course not to be
outdone by the past we've also created
some interesting chokers of our own like
this incredibly tall choker this iconic
shoe lace and this contraption which I'm
wearing once again so that is a very
brief scattered and somewhat incomplete
history of the choker necklace I think
in recent years people also associate
collar chokers with BDSM and kink but
from what I can tell those movements
only became mainstream in the late 20th
century so although there is some
connotation with them now I don't think
that's why Queen puabi was wearing
chokers I'm not entirely sure but I
don't think
why so thank you so much for watching I
