video the other day when I was
attempting to organize my makeup I look
down at a pile of my lip colors and
realized something I am a lipstick
hoarder and it's kind of becoming a
problem but how did we get here where
did all these lipsticks come from and
why do I keep buying them so I decided
to try and learn more about the
evolution of lipstick now there's a lot
of information out there so we'll
definitely miss some things but I'm
going to try my best to make some sense
of how we got to the lipstick industry
as Noah today also a big THANK YOU to
audible for sponsoring this video if you
find this topic of makeup history
interesting like I do some of the books
that I use for my research for this
video are also on audible so stay tuned
until the end of this video and I'll let
you know which books you can listen to
for more information on the topic but
for now let's get on with the video from
everything I've read it seems like
people have been painting their faces
and bodies for a very long time as soon
as we figured out we could paint caves
we started painting ourselves these
early humans wore face paint not
necessarily as ornamentation but as
ritual protection against evil spirits
in particular as they wore naturally
occurring pigments such as black yellow
and red ochre which is a fancy word for
colored mud or dirt eventually wearing
these pigments became more decorative
than ritualistic and the first
recreational makeup was born
fast forward to 2500 BC and the mainstay
in every ancient makeup bag was a
reddish Rouge for cheeks endless Rouge
is reddening effect was so desirable
because it was believed to make you look
healthy and fertile and red was also one
of the most available and vibrant
pigments at the time aside from using
red ochre ancient Egyptians also
imported the Kermes bug from Mesopotamia
to create carmine a vibrant red pigment
that is still used to this day in
lipsticks and in frappuccino throughout
antiquity lip we're stuck around in 200
BC in Han China women wore red Rouge to
reshape their lips into circles hearts
or flowers and around the same time
Roman women wore rose red or pink tinted
lip paint queen Cleopatra of Egypt
famously made her red lipstick
of beeswax crushed ants and once again
carmine
so these pigments like red ochre and
carmine seem to pop up everywhere we're
talking about ancient lipstick so I
asked my friends Catherine and Caroline
who owned their own natural makeup
company called ritual busy to come over
and show me the good I've been hearing a
lot about carmine specifically but I see
some other ones out here and I want to
know what we've got here pretty much all
these ingredients especially carmine
have been used for thousands of years we
also have annatto which is a huge that
grows in South America it's a it comes
to these little little heart-shaped seed
pods this mutant makeup for centuries
also oh it's so orange kind of cheeto e
again this is iron oxide oh so this is
yellow over it comes in a bunch of
different shades this was the original
pigment that people use for body
adornment and even like they're the
aboriginal cave paintings in Australia
our iron oxide and this is a mica and an
iron oxide flame it's basically natural
glitter and it depending on the particle
size can be sparkly or just a little bit
glowy okay so this is like your ancient
highlighter basically and carmine is
crushed beetles they're actually not
beetles
they're not they're not beetles they're
tiny insects they grow a wild or
parasitic bug and make this incredible
red dye this is the red to Cleopatra use
for her lipstick it's been used as an
artist pigment forever it's even
actually the red and red coats and the
Revolutionary War it has a really
amazing long history and actually it
grows out in California to me it's so
beautiful it's like kind of hypnotizing
anyway I'm just like boom I want to eat
it
carmen is totally safe to use by the way
I'm going to just just take a little
taste oh I got a good club your tongue
is red I like a cinnamon challenge a lot
of powder no cheat the red too now I
think I've actually licked most of it
off I was going to go brush my teeth but
um maybe I won't know but I will say
that it doesn't really taste like bugs
and I've eaten a cricket before so I
know what that tastes like
so this lipstick I'm wearing right now
is they're written in blood lipstick
which is a hundred percent carmine
pigment so around the same color I think
with all those old ones in the West
during the Middle Ages onwards lipstick
came in and out of fashion when
religious leaders who thought that
cosmetics
sinful held a lot of sway lipsticks were
out when influential style icons usually
royalty decided that they wanted to wear
lipstick lipstick came back in Queen
Elizabeth the first was noted for her
interest in makeup she wore basically a
full face of white LED and a lot of
lipstick so the one I have on now we
tried to match off of a pen thing but it
also said that she wore crimson lipstick
made out of cockney the American cousin
of the Kermes bug brought over by
Spanish trader Elizabeth allegedly
thought that lipsticks had preventative
healing powers and health benefit and it
is said that by the time of her death
she was wearing like an inch of lipstick
pink a hundred layer challenge lipsticks
ping-ponged
out of fashion during the Puritan
takeover of England in the mid 17th
century and ping-ponged back into
fashion after the restoration of Charles
ii during this time lipstick enjoyed
like a hundred year grace period
especially with the lavish fashion and
makeup choices of the french aristocrat
this high time of lipsticks came to a
screeching halt at the end of the 18th
century when the british government
started taxing the hell out of it and
the French aristocrats who loved it lost
their head now that is one way to end a
trend Queen Victoria a style icon in her
own right
however austere made sure that lipstick
stayed out of fashion for a good part of
the 19th century something to note
though is that for thousands of years
even during these times in which makeup
and lipsticks were on the outs among the
aristocrats they were still worn by
certain women who were considered on the
outskirts of society prostitutes and
actresses this was true in the West as
well as across the world in the east in
Edo period Japan
wear bright red lipstick and makeup was
part of the Kabuki theater as well as
geisha beauty regimen so up until this
point makeup held some scandalous
connotation but by the end of the 19th
century as Victoria's influence waned
and interest in cosmetics grew some
luxury brands such as Guerlain began to
dabble in the idea of lip cells and
Rouge pads for their upper-class
clientele these changing attitudes open
the door for the birth of the lipstick
industry this brings us to the nineteen
teens in America where the suffrage
movement was growing an actor
made the jump from stage to film
becoming seen as more glamorous rather
than scandalous in 1912 suffragettes
wore bright red lipstick as a sign of
solidarity and protest and in the
growing silent film industry actresses
wore dark red or plum lipstick along
with other heavy makeup no word on how
silent film actresses dealt with the
dreaded butthole lip I guess they
weren't doing a lot of talking so their
lips were like mostly closed these new
style icons created a market of women
who wanted to wear lipstick and lipstick
technology began to rise to meet this
growing demand with the invention of the
push-up lipstick - so this is a 20 style
push-up lipstick - I like to pull out
this little mirror opens up you have
somewhere to like do your lipstick right
I'm like small one over glass basically
we've got this little lever and it will
push your lipstick out the whole way not
that smooth though maybe at one point it
was smooth but I don't know the 1920s
were a new age for women in America one
defined by new freedoms and rights with
the ratification of the 19th amendment
as well as new attitudes about fashion
and style seen with the flapper movement
flappers carried bright or dark red
lipsticks proudly even applying them
gasps in public but even if you weren't
a flapper girl you still may have wanted
to wear lipstick the most popular brand
at this time was called pan G which was
a more subtle tangerine orange shade
marketed as less brash than the red
lipstick of the flapper
it was also affordable at ten cents a
two and was acceptable being sold for
pretty much the first time in front of
the counter rather than behind it the
1920s also saw a few key lipstick
innovation the push-up lipstick was
replaced by the more convenient swivel
up to makeup ad started to be printed in
color
enticing customers to buy new shape and
the ongoing growth of Hollywood health
drive the burgeoning cosmetics industry
to put in perspective how much the
cosmetics industry exploded in the 1920s
in 1917 according to Frances Fisher G
bucks only two people in the Beauty
culture business had paid an income tax
by 1927 18,000 firms and individuals in
the field reported income the 30s and
the 40s brought the Great Depression and
World War
- but neither could stop lipstick sales
during the 1930s lipstick sales rose
even as many people fell into hard
economic time this phenomenon became
known as the lipstick effect which is
the idea that during tough times people
are still willing to purchase small non
necessities such as lipsticks as a
little luxury to boost one spirit I
tried to do the 1930s overdrawn top lip
here so I look like Kylie in the 1940s
as production was halted for many goods
and factories were redirected for more
efforts lipstick kept rolling wearing
lipstick was considered patriotic and a
special wartime shade called victory red
was developed to boost morale this color
on my lips right now is supposed to be a
recreation of the color victory red it
looks a little bit similar to the 30s
red but this one has the word victory in
front of it so I think it's better red
lipstick was considered necessary and
vital by the US War Protection Board and
even appeared in the American Marine
Corps women's reserves makeup kit
designed by Elizabeth Arden okay so this
is a little makeup case from 1942
there's some blush right there and you
see that like pink shade and then we do
have a lipstick in here it pulls out of
the side Wow that's from 1940 1942
could it be victory red should I tries
to watch it or is that terrifying oh
this is petrified okay so it's not
victory red but it's like a red of some
kind I'm going to wipe that off the 50s
brought in a golden era of lipstick
fashion magazines were more popular than
ever and models from these magazines
were crossing over to Hollywood to
become
uber style icon including Grace Kelly
Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield among
others as women's scramble to emulate
their look lipstick sales boom this
increased demand drew more competition
with companies aggressively competing to
improve their formulas and marketing
techniques to one-up each other for
instance the first indelible or
long-wearing lipstick lines were created
and companies took marketing Gamble's
investing in techniques that have never
been done before notably Revlon was the
first makeup company to run television
ads during the period and it pushed
their failed far ahead of their
pedigree so these are a bunch of vintage
makeup tubes that I got off of ebay it's
hard to date them exactly like nobody
had an exact date but everyone says kind
of like 50s and 60s
look these are Avon okay wow that's much
very well that's nice whatever we're
here yeah that vintage makeup smells
also waxy right in the 60s and 70s
lipstick trends changed along with
fashion trends and social movements bold
Reds pinks and plums gave way to lighter
pinks and news frosty pastels and lip
glosses competition amongst makeup
companies continues with marketing
campaigns focused on special edition
lipstick lipstick focused on different
style tribes and for different markets
with mainstream brands beginning to
provides more specialized products for
African American women and cheaper
trendier options for teen girl in
addition to companies offering new
products the market itself was changing
in the 80s women were entering the
workforce more than ever before bold red
and pink lipstick looks came back in to
match the bold eye shadow big hair and
large shoulder pads that were worn as
war paint into the office this desire
for bold colors was reflected by the
celebrity icons at the time including
Madonna Brooke Shields Janet Jackson and
Cyndi Lauper the craziness of the 80s
was replaced by the minimalism of the
90s fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi said
of the decades in the 80s it was so
over-the-top now it's about how we can
express ourselves and still maintain a
certain amount of dignity clothes got
darker and lipstick colors got new deer
with some of the most popular shades of
the decades being brown rosy colors nude
and raisin in the 2000s as fashion got
brighter and Pinker lips got really
really really glossy sometimes clear
sometimes tinted and sometimes tingly
and fun things like this one I thought
on my face right now
it hurts a little bit these lip glosses
were worn to complement the bronzed and
shimmering makeup look of the decade
seemingly in contrast to this the decade
also brought about the birth of the long
lasting liquid lipstick but because it
was the 2000 they were almost always
paired with a glossy top coat the 2000s
so brought us more accessibility to the
Internet which brings us to the lipstick
market as we know it today some of the
makeup trends of this decade so far have
been color-changing lipsticks nude
colors metallic lipsticks and matte
liquid lipsticks smaller independent
companies can enter the market and exist
completely online an online video on
products like YouTube and Instagram help
us share learn and talk about these
trends more than ever it's pretty
amazing to see how much lipstick has
changed in just the last 100 years when
in 1917 only two people made money
selling cosmetics it's been a pretty
wild 100 years a lot of stuff has
happened a lot of lipstick has happened
and a lot of that lipstick is in my
drawers I hope I don't get blood
poisoning
so once again thank you to audible for
sponsoring this video I actually did
some of my research for this video while
doing laundry and the number one book
that I would recommend for more
information on this topic is hope in a
jar by Cathy pipe or paste

name but it's on the screen next book

perceived over time and especially that
change in perspectives on makeup that
occurred at the turn of the 20th century
