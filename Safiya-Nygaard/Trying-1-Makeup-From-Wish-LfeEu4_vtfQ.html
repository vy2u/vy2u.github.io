hello friends and welcome to another
video today we're gonna be buying and
trying an entire face of makeup from
wish now if you don't know what wish is
it's an e-commerce marketplace that
sells pretty much everything at really
low prices and I've bought a few things
from there before including clothing
items listed as free and tech products
and in general I would say the halls
were pretty hit or miss with the clothes
being a little more hit and the
electronics being a little more miss but
I've always been curious about the super
slash suspiciously low cost makeup
listed on their site so today we're
gonna order some and see what happens
when I put it on my face I wonder how
many things I'm gonna buy from wish
before I learn my lesson alright let's
head to wesh.com
my old friend wish calm so wish has its
own like makeup and beauty tabs so let's
head over there so first up I'm gonna be
looking for the complexion products so
the foundation and concealer
straightaway I'm seeing what looks like
a bunch of tampons but I think those are
hair curlers I'm also seeing like a
waist trainer and a lot of hair removal
products maybe that's next mustache
removers from wish so I finally stumbled
upon a foundation after scrolling for a
while this is a long wear foundation
that kind of looks like Rihanna's fenty
beauty foundation but there's no way
that it's fenty beauty foundation for
two dollars it has three and a half
stars on 34 reviews and on sizing
apparently someone said that it was too
small I don't know what that means
interesting no one who left a review
seems to say that like anything bad
happened with the foundation the only
problems people have had or with the
shipping or with the pump so maybe this
is decent foundation who knows and it
turned to $4 as soon as I added it to
the cart so it did that fun wish thing
where the prices just change randomly
alright so that's gonna be our
foundation so let's grab a concealer
really quick and then move on to the
more um artistic parts I write concealer
where art thou conceal ah seriously so
many waist trainers so many teeth
whitener kits edible Lube good I'm glad
that's in the makeup section I might
have to search for concealer alright
this is def
concealer and this one is free sort of
looks like the nyx concealer that i've
used before the thing about seeing like
makeup products for one dollar or for
free is it it makes me think of like all
of those videos and articles that have
been done about fake makeup or bootleg
makeup where like there's very strange
and questionable ingredients in them so
admittedly getting this may not be the
best idea but we'll see people seem to
like this though is four stars on 643
reviews I only see one comment that the
smell is a bit strong but everyone else
seems to be into it except for a couple
of people who haven't tried it and yet
still decided to review it and then in
their comments said haven't tried it yet
alright so let's look at the color
selection no so watches to be found so
I'm gonna try color number two because
it's light but not the light test all
right I'm gonna add this to my cart and
that's gonna be our concealer so I'm
gonna go in for the eyebrows next
alright so it looks like they've got a
lot of listings for normal looking
eyebrow pencils this first one looks
great it's free and it says that two
hundred thousand people bought this so
it's called the waterproof eyebrow
pencil pen eyebrow liner cosmetic makeup
Beauty tool lasting waterproof eyebrow
pencil and I say those like that because
they're all lower case for some reason
interestingly enough I've had pretty
good luck with super low-cost eyebrow
pencils before so I kind of believe that
this could be like a really popular
product so let's pick this up in the
color coffee so that's gonna be our
eyebrow product and I'm gonna add that
guy to the card alright so next up let's
look at some eyeshadows I would love to
get a little bit of a palette just so we
can you know have some options play the
field a little bit let's take a look at
these ones these are four dollar
eyeshadow palettes and they kind of
seemed to be like sort of imitating the
Anastasia Beverly Hills modern
renaissance palette they're kind of like
square pans in rosy colors so weird
they've got a bunch of different styles
of palettes like completely different
palettes that were not even shown in the
listing back here alright so it looks
like the palette that I originally
wanted is style pea number one so that's
gonna be our eye shadow right mascara is
what we need ooh I don't want to go with
her because she
like she's a little in pain because her
eyelashes are so overwhelming the
interesting thing about these makeup
products is that there seem to be a lot
of like different listings for what
seems to be the same product or at least
like the same product photos so I'm not
sure if they're all like different
mascaras or if they're just like the
same mascaras being sold by slightly
different vendors I think I'm gonna go
with this mascara cuz there's a cat on
it it's one dollar and it has four and a
half stars on 20 reviews I'm having a
hard time finding anyone who will say
anything bad about these makeup products
so I'm not sure if I should actually be
reassured or suspicious with that said
let's add this cat guide to the cart
real quick and move on to the eyeliner
oh and right away this looks really fun
and there seems to be a lot of listings
for it it's a sort of like double-ended
felt tip liquid eyeliner with a stamp at
one end and like a marker at the other
it seems a bit safer than trying to
stamp eyeliner on your face with
scissors so let's try this instead
people seem to be liking the stamp a lot
so hopefully that'll be fun to play with
and we'll see if it makes you know
getting the perfect cat eye any easier I
also hope it just works in general but
hopefully it also helps with getting the
perfect cat eye let's add this guy to
the part real quick and move on to a
different area of the face so let's
start off with some contour stuff I
usually like to use powder contour so
that would be my preferred method this
looks like it could be a contour palette
let's take a look
ah yes this is up 6 colour pressed
powder palette nude 15 color camouflage
concealer make professional cream
palette wait so is it a pressed powder
palette or a cream palette coz it says
both oh I think that like the eyeshadow
this has like different listings for
products as different styles under the
same product listing and I would guess
that this image is up the cream palette
and this one is up the pressed powder
I'm just hoping so I'm gonna go for
style number 2 although it's not clear
which of these palettes has four stars
I'm actually seeing a couple of negative
reviews down here one from Caitlyn who
says that the product definitely has a
smell and one from Joan who gave it one
star and said I haven't tried it yet but
I love it alright so
let's add this to the cart and call that
our contour all right so let's get some
blush some Rouge oh so straight away
there seem to be a few listings for this
blush so let's click on this one that at
least a thousand people have bought
alright so this one is a little bit less
highly reviewed it's got three and a
half stars on 350 reviews although when
I look at the actual written out reviews
they look good except for two people who
say that there's no lid and the product
just comes like completely exposed so
let's take a look at these colors I
think let's go with number seven tipsy
it's just I feel like that looks like my
kind of blush color though tor love
seems fun because I think that they
misspelled true love all right so that's
the blush let's do highlighter next I
usually prefer a powder highlighter and
there do seem to be a couple of those
but this listing right here looks to be
a $1 dupe or knockoff of the coverfx
illuminating drops this has four stars
on nine reviews and Miranda says that it
works well let's hope that Miranda's
right of these colors I think I'm gonna
get sunlight so I'm gonna add that to my
cart and we'll definitely compare that
to the real product when it gets here
alright last up the lips straight off
the bat there seem to be a lot of like
matte liquid lipsticks there's like a
liquid lipstick set called nice face oh
interesting this listing
seems to be like a lip kit like it looks
like it has a liquid lipstick and a
pencil this is the waterproof matte one
piece liquid lip gloss one pieces lip
liner pencil smooth lipstick
long-lasting cosmetic makeup kit so it's
unclear if it's a lip gloss or a liquid
lipstick but it's something and also a
lip pencil oh and coincidentally this is
also a nice face product
I keep thinking KC nice tat whenever I
say that move over Kylie and baby
Kacie nice face is on the scene so just
to complement our rosy face I'm gonna go
with this like pinky purple number two
color alright so I'm gonna add this to
my cart and I think with that we've got
a full face of makeup in our cart right
now so the next time you see me I'll
hopefully have all of my wish makeup
here and also hopefully not be damaging
my skin
too badly okay so it's been a couple of
months and I finally have all of my wish
makeup items here so after all of this
waiting and anticipation let's dive
right in and start with the brows so
this is the dream goddess eyebrow pencil
it looks like a pretty normal
eyebrow pencil though when I open it up
it looks like there's no spoolie but the
bends all looks pretty good so I can
spoil myself if needed all right so
let's go in on the right brow right now
it's a little more subtle than I usually
go but you know maybe that's good that's
fair all right I'm gonna go in for the
second brow I will say it feels like I
have to press down a little bit to
really get some pigment off of this
eyebrow pencil but once you go over it a
few times it definitely shows up
eventually and I would say the ending
result is actually pretty nice so I
think that the hordes of people who seem
to like this eyebrow pencil are pretty
much right you just have to remember to
pack your own spoolie okay so with our
eyebrows done let's move on to the eye
shadow so this is called the we care
your favors 18 shades full function
palette what are they trying to say I
give care to favor you and here is the
actual palette kind of smells it smells
like that old school putty they used to
squish inside of a plastic cup to make
fart sounds just one thing to note
before we go in is that they spelled
moonlight moonlight all right I'm gonna
use bisque as my base shade and put that
all over both of my eyes and then next
I'm gonna go in with Indian red oh
that's showing up it's not like super
soft and buttery but it is providing
color to my eye I'm also gonna throw a
dash of salmon on there I did not mean
to go so orange but it just sort of
started happening there is a second
salmon that's just like a a gold color
no I don't think so maybe it's like the
color of the water rippling above the
fish as it migrates north to mate isn't
that what they do we go upstream yeah
yeah and to finish it off I'm just gonna
put a little bit of moonligh underneath
my brow bone okay
I think that's an eye shadow look I
think in general these eye shadows seem
to be okay I wouldn't say they're like
stellar eye shadows but they're
definitely serviceable the shimmers do
show up a lot better than the mattes
though and yes there are three mats they
not just to okay so up next are the
complexion products so the concealer
that we ordered is the forest cosmetics
HD high definition concealer which I
think looks pretty similar to my NYX HD
studio concealer to be fair this isn't a
complete ripoff like they're not
pretending to be NYX but it seems like
they're pretending to be a similar
product now color wise they don't look
the same but I don't think that's the
reason not to like the far as concealer
texture wise the forest' concealer felt
a little bit more greasy so we'll see
how it feels on the face it smells like
hotel body lotion it smells like
something that you want to keep on
sniffing but you shouldn't like
something you huff
yes exactly don't Huff all right so I'm
gonna blend this out and it seems to be
disappearing but it doesn't feel as
greasy as it did on my hand all right
I wouldn't say my under-eye luggage is
really covered but like it's some it's
got a little veil and then next up is
the fenty Beauty foundation so this is
the real fenty Beauty Foundation and
this is the fake one and though they've
tried their best with the font and the
color scheme the bottles look nothing
alike they also have copied all of the
text so on the back and says it was made
in Italy and also that it contains 1.0 8
fluid ounces but like is it possible
that those two bottles contain the same
amount of stuff maybe but I doubt it and
then in terms of the swatch the fenty
beauty is like extremely watery and this
is like a little gel it smells kind of
like cake batter alright here we go I'm
going to dot this around and then blend
it out the color is not horrible it
seems to be working for me it's
definitely like a little bit more tan
than I am but because it's not super
full coverage I think I'm getting away
with it
I'm also noticing this strange thing
where I find a spot on my face that
seems like it doesn't have foundation on
it and then I try to put foundation
there and Foundation won't stay there
all right so I think that's my
fenty Beauty foundation in general I
don't think that the color match is too
bad and it actually doesn't feel too bad
on my face but it definitely looks
pretty shiny and it smells cake batter
ish so next up I'm just gonna bake this
down with my real setting powder just to
give it a little bit of a fighting
chance against my oily face and then we
can contour I think this is the contour
there's nothing on the outside but based
on process of elimination I think this
is the contouring palette tah-dah why
don't I say it like that it's a lot
smaller than I thought it would be for
like size comparison here's my Beauty
Blender it smells like a brand new
rubber bouncy ball you just bought from
the toy store it also smells kind of
like a pool noodle all right so I'm
gonna take this color over here and use
it to pull my contour so I'm gonna suck
in my cheeks and go to town all right I
think that after a little bit of working
that into my skin we definitely got some
color payoff you know I think that it's
performance on the face is definitely
better than its appearance and smell in
the pan
so before I blend this out I'm gonna go
in with my blush alright so this is the
focal or color mix blush in the color
tipsy and it appears they've sent us not
a blush but like a refill pan which may
be what those girls in the reviews were
saying about how they just got like it
without anything covering it I was
expecting it inside of a compact but
then it's blush I guess oh that first
sweep looked like blush oh my god this
is good blush sorry I sound so surprised
okay so I think this is our finished
cheek look though I would say that the
smell and the presentation of the
contour palette was pretty odd I think
that it went on okay after a little bit
of negotiating and I think the blush was
actually pretty good so let's go in with
the eyeliner now alright so this is a
double sided eyeliner it's got the
marker on one end and the stamp on the
other so I'm gonna use the stamp side to
create a wing and then you know use the
other side to fill it out it's not great
but it definitely could be worse
it is pretty pigmented though at least
it didn't like you know half stamp
alright ready I'm gonna go smear the pap
smear
alright so I'm gonna draw in the rest of
this line and then I'm gonna try and do
the other side to match the tip just
does become a little bit flaccid if you
pull it in the wrong direction I don't
think that the ending product is half
bad but I'm not sure that the wings
stamp makes this eyeliner a lot faster
because there is a decent amount of
fixing work you have to do and also with
the marker side it's decently easy to
use but the tip does get a little bit
sort of smushed besides those
things though I do have eyeliner on my
face and my eyes haven't fallen off all
right so next up is the mascara which is
our sweet cat max Volume Mascara oh it's
a really cute cat I can smell that from
here oh very conscious what is that
smell
it smells like if you had an acrylic
paint that was feegan newton scented
it's definitely not like a super super
dramatic lash but it is defined and not
too clumpy I don't think the formula
itself has a lot of punch to it but it's
not clumpy and it's cat themed what more
could you want in a mascara the answer
is nothing
all right so our second to last item is
this faux cover FX highlighter so I went
out and got the actual cover FX
highlighter and it's hard for me to tell
the difference at least when they're in
the box out of the box it's a little bit
easier to tell as for the swatch this is
the actual one and this is the fake one
I think maybe the fake one has a little
bit of a thicker of glitter chunk but
it's very hard to tell all of these
products smells so strongly like this
one smells like hairspray and for that
reason it almost smells like a dance
recital okay there that is unfortunately
I think it's more of like individual
glitter specks than a sort of nice
copper sheen and on my hand it's
strangely dried down whereas the
original coverfx is still sort of moist
I don't think it's horrible but it's
definitely more glittery than the
original and it just it smells like
ballet class and rounding out our full
face of wish makeup is the KC nice face
lip kit ooh
it's maybe a little bit more purple than
I expected it to be so uh hopefully it
goes with our look here alright so I'm
gonna go in with a lip pencil first oh
that's sharp oh it's my first impression
is that this hurts just a little bit but
besides that it seems to be pretty
pigmented and now time for the lip gloss
that smells like caramel popcorn alright
let's go in this is a liquid lipstick
100% this is not a lip gloss it's
drawing down pretty fast so I kinda have
to work quickly alright so the color of
this lipstick ended up turning out a
little bit differently than I thought it
would but my main complaint is the
texture the butt hole is a little
wrinkly but with the lipstick I think
we've completed our full face of wish
makeup and I'm gonna wear it for the
rest of the
see if my face falls off or if I get
really oily or what happens all right so
it's a couple of hours later and I think
in general the makeup is doing okay
above my nose are pretty much all the
products that I thought worked pretty
well below my nose the foundation is
sort of worn off right here and also my
lipstick is kind of coming off so I
would say that around here things are
going well and down here things are a
little more questionable all right so
it's been about six hours since I
applied my full face of wish makeup and
I think actually it's wearing better
than I thought it would at this point my
foundation has definitely gotten a
little bit oily but everything around my
eyes has pretty much stayed intact so I
think my favorite products were the
eyeliner pencil the mascara and the
blush and my least favorite products
were the highlighter and the lipstick
although a few of these products did
work for me something I would point out
as a reason to not regularly buy makeup
from wish is that some of these products
and a fair amount of the products I saw
on the site are fake or like counterfeit
versions of actual makeup products and a
lot of them either don't list the
ingredients or list the same ingredients
as the makeup they're counterfeiting so
you don't actually know what's inside of
them and unlike with other products from
wish these look really interact with
your skin and you know your skin is your
largest organ so you might want to be
kind to it also all these products smell
kind of weird my face kind of smells
like a Cracker Jack cake batter chlorine
combo and it's weird thank you guys so
