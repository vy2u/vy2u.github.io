video today we're gonna be testing out
questionable beauty hacks from Instagram
videos now we've previously tested out
some strange hacks from Facebook videos
with mediocre success and since then
pretty much all I've been seeing on my
instagram explorer page are similar
Beauty hack videos they seem to think
that I'm a hacker that I like hacks or
that I am a hack so I've decided to take
these referrals as a sign that I should
dive back in and put these videos to the
test
Instagram has a lot of beauty videos in
general which are often speckled or
arranged into playlists on the explore
page or free booted from individual
creators and reposted by big make up
accounts and by design you can churn
through like dozens of these videos at a
time I mean look at those thumbnails
don't you want to click on those is that
James Charles almost all of these videos
are sped up have little to no talking
and oh yeah Instagram also doesn't have
a progress bar so you can't skip around
or rewind in addition I find that
Instagram videos are more prone to true
click baiting than Facebook videos
you'll get some classic thumbnails like
this one with a giant red vampire eye
but then when you click into the video
it's just a normal eye shadow tutorial
but some of these videos are just click
bTW and that they use a ridiculous
seeming method in order to get an
enticing thumbnail whether or not that
method helps you do anything faster or
better or anything at all and those are
the videos we're gonna be mostly
focusing on today as much as I would
like to try out permanent retina damage
alright so let's dive right into these
the first hack is certainly beauty
related but it's not for your face it is
in fact for the pits that's right your
armpits that's what I mean
it's an armpit Beauty hack alright so
this video was reposted by makeup vines
but it's originally by Sarah revolta the
collards are pretty harsh there are a
lot of like nauseous green emojis and
one girl says tbh I threw up so
basically what happens is Sarah wakes up
and oh no she has armpits she doesn't
want you to see them so she's gonna
cover them with honey
oats and baking soda I think actually
the premise is that she has like dark
skin on her underarms or something
because she certainly doesn't have any
hair interestingly enough DIY armpit
lightening masks are kind of a motif
throughout a lot of Instagram hack
videos I feel like it's kind of like
bleaching your be whole it's like a
little unnecessary but if you really
want to I guess you can so she puts her
DIY mixture like on her armpits and then
she sits with it for a while to let it
do it's good stuff she doesn't say how
long you should leave it on for oh all
right so maybe she means ten minutes
because as she's leaning back she just
goes ten but after some amount of time
she scoops the oatmeal off and feeds it
to her boyfriend I am so happy and yet
also sad for Tyler that that occurred
because now he has to eat my armpit
oatmeal what you shower today right
yes I shower every day and I smell very
good always that's why all right the
first thing she does is honey and it
doesn't look like she has like very
specific proportions she just kind of
has like a big old spoon and just puts
in a big old spoon as for the oats she
kind of does like one heaping tablespoon
so I'm gonna do like a couple of these
there we go and for the baking soda she
kind of just does like a little less all
right so her next step is that she mixes
it together and right off the bat it's
pretty dry I think I might need a little
more honey how am I so bad at this I
will say she just seems like she just
sort of did a couple of swipes and then
it was like a nice sort of wet mixture
all right ready for the application is
this what I'm supposed to do this feels
like the worst like sexy role-playing
thing ever it's like a Cosmo tip it's
like spice it up by bringing food into
the bedroom
oh it's honey and baking soda in your
pits I will say it smells kind of good
though
all right I'm like a little bit unsure
of how to do this with my other arm pit
full of oatmeal already oh I need help
I can't do this with my left hand it
really doesn't spread does it Oh No
spread it down no down not out I'll hold
the camera
instructor not out tie it up and down it
slightly different definitions of armpit
here alright here we go after some
struggle both my armpits are oted my oh
I'm just gonna get tired
okay so it's been about 10 minutes since
I put on the right armpits oatmeal and
the oatmeal has definitely warmed up in
fact it's turned kind of like whitish
and creamy almost as if it's cooked or
perhaps like reacted somehow with the
baking soda she basically just like
scrapes it off with the spoon and then
immediately tricks her boyfriend into
eating it alright ty are you ready
I got a spoonful of oatmeal for you why
am i doing this oh that's not food is it
these are really that bad you just
drooled all over very salty it's salty
that's my sweat alright so after wiping
off our oatmeal mask completely I'm not
sure that my armpits are any lighter it
kind of feels like maybe they were just
exfoliated a little nicely I did really
have to kind of scrub those oats off and
taking a look at her after armpits they
look pretty much the same but in terms
of the execution of this hack I just got
oats all over this floor and my shirt
and I might have poisoned Tyler so I
think that you know you could probably
just use like a body scrub on your
armpits and save yourself a lot of mess
alright so for our second hack we're
gonna go in for another lightining
treatment except this time instead of
being for your underarms it's for your
under eyes so this is a video by Medina
shreya nada
she basically sort of pops up and she
has like very exaggerated dark circles
they look pretty fake like maybe she
just put like a lot of eyeshadow
underneath her eye and then she's skins
and cuts up a potato put some honey and
black pepper on the slices and puts them
under her eye for five minutes and then
when she lifts them off of her eyes the
dark circles are gone as well as the eye
shadow now it does say further down into
her caption that she's mimicked dark
circles but it's pretty far down and I
think people in the comments aren't
really having it so with that let's try
it this is coincidentally a great time
to try and test this hack because I was
up till 6 a.m. last night and I have a
whole under-eye suitcase situation going
on okay so the first
is to peel the potato No I'm not very
good at this okay I just slice off the
peel this is much better I got it to be
sort of like a geometric gemstone by
just peeling it with a knife alright so
basically she just sort of cuts off like
little sections that would cover her
under eye area and then next she just
puts a little bit of honey on him and
then she goes like this so then the next
thing she does is she just sprinkles
some black pepper on and then applies it
to her eyes Cheers
okay this wasn't so bad I will say that
right off the bat the potatoes kind of
cold so I'm feeling some refreshment so
that's probably actually good for your
under eye circles move over a cucumber
slice potato is coming for your wig I'm
not feeling any sneeze eNOS or eye pain
because of the pepper as of yet the
pepper is more just like texture it's
like I feel like a piece wedged in
between the potato and me alright so in
five minutes let's take these bad boys
off and see if my under-eye circles have
packed their bags and left are you ready
for my Princess Diaries reveal well you
don't have a unibrow so I do have a
unibrow I just plucked it tada
oh I look like I was just crying coffee
grounds oh actually now that I've lifted
the potato up I'm actually feeling the
tingling from the black pepper and like
almost a little spice oh oh it's hot oh
this is odd I feel like I have like a
bengay patch underneath my eyes you and
I mean like a Salone puss I think that
maybe some of the logic behind this hack
is that the pepper will like stimulate
blood flow but my undereyes just kind of
hurt and I don't think they look much
better now she said this was her under
eye routine so maybe like one time isn't
enough but that is a lot of work and
pain for maybe so I've put on some
foundation because the next hack is a
makeup hack so this account dramatized
free booted and reposted this video from
promised to Ming they gave her some
credit but you definitely had to click
read more to see it so the thing that
stuck out to me about this hack is that
it's basically like a surprise double
hack from the thumbnail it looks like
she's using tweezers to somehow contour
her nose and when you click in she's
actually using the tweezers to draw in
her eyebrow
after he completely does her eyebrows at
the very end she does her nose kind of
quickly so it was kind of like an
emotional rollercoaster I thought I had
been click baited and then right at the
end I was saved all right so I think
what she does is she just like takes the
eyebrow gel and like paints the ends of
her tweezer with it she has thinner
eyebrows than I do so I worry that my
eyebrows may not be contained by these
tweezers as she gets to the back she
closes the tweezer did that do anything
I feel like I just got a little bit of
eyebrow gel in the head of my brow right
here
I do have slightly wider tweezers that
maybe would work better so let's try
those that didn't do much I'm gonna try
more of a pomade than a gel just to you
know give it more of an impact
oh that's darker that's better and then
narrow it narrow it oh I skid marked all
right let me try the other side and then
we'll try and fold them in oh no oh no
left hand no good the thing is it's not
decidedly worse than the other one but
neither are really great looking Angry
Bird right now I feel like an angry bird
right now I feel like I'm getting the
intent of the hack but my artistic
abilities are not really up to snuff so
let's try out the nose contour maybe
I'll be better at that since there's
less like drawing involved all right
ready
I don't think I did that well with this
one either
I think that this hack easily goes
skidmark it takes the skidmark exit
nearly every time I don't know what kind
of brush she's using so I'm just gonna
use this brush and just try and buff it
out buff it out
well what buff it out I will admit that
I don't do nose contouring very often
this side looks okay and then you go
over to this side and it's just sad now
though compared to my nose contour my
eyebrows are looking great so I'm happy
about that at least I think if you have
the right features that fit inside of
like a normal sized tweezer maybe this
might actually work for you but besides
that I do think it's a little more
trouble than it's worth
okay so the next hack is another makeup
hack and I actually recognize the
company that's made it it's Christine's
favorite channel trim trim got to get
that tuned true yes so this video was
reposted by DIY amazing DIY but I think
something got lost in translation
because the video doesn't really make a
lot of sense early on in the video they
introduced the hack which is like using
a spoon over your eye to like create
like an eye shadow look and then they
sort of like put clip in extensions in
their hair apply some eyeliner and then
are like told by a third person to only
use one hand and then by the end of the
video they've given up on doing their
makeup entirely none of that is
explained or captioned it's just if you
keep watching the video after the hack
you'll notice that there's a lot more
video and it doesn't make any sense okay
and with that let's try it
alright I'm just gonna put like a little
bit of a base shade on I don't really
know what else this girl does she just
kind of puts a spoon on her eye and then
goes to town though to be fair she kind
of does like this sort of crease action
and then moves on to do something
off-camera and when she comes back her
eye shadow looks a lot better so there's
definitely some movie magic involved
alright I've got a couple different
spoons I think I'm gonna go with this
one because it's flatter and then I'm
gonna take a little bit of this brick
color and go in oh that's moving my
contact around I can feel that but this
is hard to do with one eye oh that's
gonna be a good cut crease first doesn't
end up being a cut crease it just sort
of ends up being like a dramatic crease
look okay my contacts back tada I think
that over here we are seeing something
that could be like an eye shadow look
but in general it's not very symmetric
or even let me try the other spoon on
the other eye I think this one's a
little more rounded so hopefully it'll
be a little more flush to my eyeball
good the thing is for a starting point
for eye shadow like you could start from
here and then just like keep blending it
out I'm just not sure that using a spoon
is easier than just like putting the
product straight onto your eye just to
be fair to true and true I'm gonna blend
this out a little bit you know just to
make it like more of a look in general
this video just confuses me I think it's
almost like a game of like bad Beauty
hack telephone but that seems to be a
big part of Instagram videos in general
a lot of them are stolen and chopped up
I guess that might contribute to why
they're so confusing originally I had
suspected that this was multiple truned
room videos cut together but amazingly
all of the footage is actually just from
one video called makeup challenge full
face using food and school supplies I
guess these weren't meant to be hacks
after all okay so this last hack is a
hair hack that I'm very excited about so
this video was posted by a page called
makeup vines but it was free booted from
five-minute crafts so basically what it
is you put a scrunchie on like the
nozzle of a vacuum cleaner and then you
vacuum up your hair put the scrunchie on
and voila
ponytail this hack in particular I
remember seeing in like a viral video
from a few years ago about like a
disgruntled dad trying to do his
daughter's hair so Tyler will have the
honour of vacuuming my head today
so basically it's me testing this hack
yes but it's my head on the line without
further ado let's vacuum some hair I
ready for it into the ponytail No
it keeps getting your shirt did it work
is that what they want us to do you know
that tickled the sound was absolutely
terrifying but the sensation was quite
nice try it again so I'm gonna double it
up this time because I think is a little
loose hey that wasn't so bad I have a
complete chunk of hair that's missing
but that's artful I guess you look like
a spunky like zoo Disney character right
now let me try it one more time it's
still a little messy if you got so much
hair oh here we go here we go here we go
that's what I'm talking about and that's
a ponytail it's not perfect but it's
close the level of perfection from
five-minute crafts is pretty
mind-blowing because there's like stray
hairs everywhere it's not so bad I'm
surprised that it worked even as well as
it did a major con to this though is
that the inside of a vacuum sees some
stuff and you probably don't want that
stuff on your head besides that I'm not
sure it's faster than just doing a
normal ponytail yourself but it's
definitely more exciting so viral video
yes hack that you recommend to people I
don't think so this could be kind of a
good prank though hey let me help you
but like give you a slightly messy
ponytail okay so those were my
questionable Instagram hacks I'm not
sure I really got the hang of any of
these hacks but I think the one that was
the closest to a hack that might
actually work was the tweezer one the
other ones may have had some effect but
I don't think the results were worth the
trouble pain or mess so I wouldn't
consider them better than traditional
methods I think my main takeaway from
this is that the reason why Instagram
has so many hacks like these which are
so ridiculous in nature is that the
video posters or repost errs are working
within the confines of Instagram where
you only really get a thumbnail to work
with
there aren't any visible video titles on
Instagram and you can only see the
caption after you've clicked it so you
kind of have to make a video that will
lend itself to having a crazy
thumbnail and if you don't well then you
just have to make up a thumbnail to be
fair these videos can be pretty
entertaining so if they were marketed
more as things you should watch rather
than things you should do they'd be a
lot less perplexing I would just also
say to Instagram please add a progress
bar and to you all at home maybe don't
put black pepper under your eyes thank
you guys so much for watching if you
like that video make sure to smash that
like button and if you want to see more
