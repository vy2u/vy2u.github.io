video today we're going to be trying out
Harry Potter sorting hat bath bomb and
I'm jazzed I'm dressed to or jazzed so I
thought these bath bombs both on
Instagram and in a bunch of articles
written about them basically the way
they work is that they you can't tell
what's inside from the outside and then
you dump them in the bath and then they
turn a house color and they sort cute I
have taken the Pottermore sorting hat
quiz probably like 5 times
just cuz it's fun I think because you
get sorted into the wrong house and you
have to take it again so you might
identify as a ravenclaw but really
you're only a ravenclaw like 2 out of 5
times i'm not trim read out of 5 times
I've taken it about five times
big great o'clock I've gotten ravenclaw
four times and slithering one I was
pretty good the reason Tyler hasn't
taken the Pottermore quiz is because he
took the Patronus quiz and he didn't
like his results I got his present you
know I got a black bird which I'm fine
with
like what's the pheasant gonna do to me
like you good and dark I think Tyler's a
Gryffindor from above the bird I think
Tyler well that's a difficult question
we're Americans that we action was
deliver warning but to scrap that for
now so Tyler's going to take a bath try
out that bath bomb and then we're going
to take the Pottermore quiz to see if
the bath bomb was right then I'm going
to take the pot and work with once again
to show you guys that I'm truly a
Ravenclaw and then I'll get a bath bomb
as well this is my first battle like a
really really long time
where shower people we've been dating
for two years upkeep everything the best
I've taken like to one bath event you're
not a big bath fan I just I like the
shower on I like things getting washed
down I pee in the shower you can't be in
the battle you can't be in bad it's my
chef Sarah who lives right now by the
way I'm seeing a lot of kitty litter in
this bath with me so I tried to clean it
out oh it so much foot though there's
just a layer of kitty litter everywhere
apartment I think fine with any of the
houses I kind of self-identified
Gryffindor I will talk this to draw me
lately so much power such a small thing
Oh what so I ordered a 6-pack of the
Harry Potter sorting hat bath bomb and I
tried to open one and it disintegrated
in my hand as I was opening it and it
was a Ravenclaw and I then I tried to
open a second one and it fell into the
sink and disintegrated in my hands and
it was also a ravenclaw so I'm pretty
sure there must be no Raven plug left
because some of them disintegrated me to
come from England right I don't know
anyway
well they've come along just this to be
this point so I'm just going to open
this guy over the back so we can only
figure out what it is all things most
credited is it that I don't try it oh oh
Bob I
I get them as literate sick - OH - it
smells really good uh pretty amazing
it's not looks leather event it feels
great it feels like there's a thin layer
of candy in my body this is interesting
because I've never thought of myself as
whether it but I do like a lot more I
said that I was open to any of the
houses and I'm gonna stick by it if the
brakes you get my dad always said to me
you just couldn't got to be Joe whatever
you're doing so I'm Joe southern right
now oh you're on Christmas you're a
planner I'm taking a chance on something
completely how deep is this water you
feel soft nice smell pretty night softer
than usual you don't want to committing
to it southern right now yeah nobody so
they're here so maybe it was fate that I
ruined the first - backbone yes
the first reason up like if I was in
Ravenclaw I don't like this yeah I mean
your written competition all right be
sorry discover your house cooler stars
now I like stars but I do love a big
pale moon nickel but oh here we go
you're attending Hogwarts which pet
would you choose to take with you tabby
cat Siamese cat white cat you know
actually I don't need to do this I know
it'd be as happy cat right it cost you
would love Hogwarts Krusty is definitely
another man okay after you have died
what would you most like people to do
when they hear your name miss you but
smile ask for more stories about your
adventures I don't care what people
think of me after I'm dead it's what
they think of me while I'm alive that
counts well clearly one of those is
perfect
it's funny when they try to plant the
questions and they're painfully obvious
yeah they're like are you cool with
Horcruxes heads or tails this is a big
one guys it's hard I'm going tails they
go oh why I thought you were going for
Slytherin I'm all twisted up no guys
because I got waiting to the same with
you know I felt identified as Gryffindor
I didn't get it from the bat bollocks I
find it the bat bombs the more efficient
test and so I was like okay I'm keep
Slytherin I'm very good flick today fill
it
let's get mine we're gonna have to
return your robe if you're not ready
love dawn or dusk yeah how would you
like to be known to history the wise the
good the great the bowl they're
literally in the colors see this is what
you're like stop you're just choosing
what with us again to raise the cloth
authentic chest taking over here which
of the Fallen would you most like to
study buddy
Centaurus goblin merpeople troll troll
in the dungeon what you want to know
left or right on your website I think
it's got to be left I think left it
interesting totally freaking out so much
I'm trying to eat what hang out we just
freaked Krusty out so bad okay so I got
Ravens law you find it on your sixth
time taking the test it's easier to get
ready pong again I mean let that will
let the bass Bob decide what I Lynch on
my feet just got everywhere just don't
zoom in on the lint
I swear I clean this tub what is it the
reason I'm not nervous
I mean I really to raise a ball one so
maybe I was meant to be rave quality
just broke or maybe Ty Lee was meant to
be a very good ball or maybe not as much
me in Slytherin and I was opposed to
break bones the only reason I don't want
Hubble pop is because it's just going to
look like I need justin is ready
what did the ASL wait what is it what
color is it
I don't know man what color is it oh
there we go it's yellow then you knew
your swim season style appeal Oh limit
hobble thought had the best location for
a vert house a little bit next to the
kitchen it smells great if you'll say
visit like that all right yeah it smells
like it's all kinda like generically
sweet
what kind of vanilla ish and then in
general I feel like the nice coating
there's some like lotions or
moisturizers in there this is a thing
I've never gotten top to top on any
quizzes so like maybe there is a part of
me that's how the puffs the the part
that like to take baths and I don't
merge it maybe Hufflepuff is like you
take some more basses so we wanted to do
an extra bath bomb for crusty and we're
not going to be able to get crusty in
here I'll able to knock the crushinator
great oh this is fall apart does it
happen to you so he sorted crusty
correctly that means is that clearly
this thing is correct Tyler and crusty
match made in heaven we're both
Slytherin I thought 11 is good here is
one of the 1 disappears dropped as she
was cutting it open
ready go clear back on there I mean we
already doing it oh just getting
everything bla play pretty doing very
nice colors yeah that looks good okay
I'm gonna do my hat shopping Myrtle in
there in general I feel like this is fun
there's so many essential oils in my
body now I just feel like really
moisturized so that's awesome and it
could add some magic to your bath but
you know I don't know that it was
accurate in general I think that the
only true sorting happens in Hogwarts
with the sorting hat
but Pottermore is probably you know with
and after that and then I would trust
these bat-ball here's my list it goes
bath bomb bath bomb bath bomb just one
