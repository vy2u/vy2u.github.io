hello friends and welcome to another
video today we're going to be doing
something in honor of Valentine's Day
which has already passed so I ordered
Kylie Jenner's Kylie cosmetics
Valentine's Day collection and I ordered
it on a second and you know God bless
Kylie but it did not derive a time for
Valentine's Day it actually did arrive
on Valentine's Day at like 6 or 7 p.m.
so obviously too late for us to film a
literal Valentine's Day right now but I
really wanted to film a Valentine's Day
collection video with my Valentine and
he's not just my Valentine on February
14 he's my Valentine campaign
so what some sweet do creepy / colony
very fast that proof that the fear will
inevitably catch me into volcano at the
point so happens represents the fiery
burning hot passion of my vows I've been
there for many a purchasing of a Kylie
Jenner product ok this is your last
December when I was running around like
the LA area basically like trolling
Craigslist trying to find the Kylie lip
kit Tyler came with me to Orange County
to meet this girl to buy the Kylie lip
kit offer and we like met in a Starbucks
and like exchange cash it has been a
parking lot and ever since that time
I've tested a decent amount of Kylie
makeup I feel like honestly Kylie puts
it out of cap so I can test it
listen you thought you do thought you
were finished when you bought the
holiday collection nope Valentine's Day
less than two months later you know next
year I bet you Labor Day Kylie Lee wave
election if you hang out the next beat
you might remember a room where I put
like Chi Majesty on his lips and like
kind of like hi Majesty my majesty
put like little sort of like hearts and
stuff of the other lip kits around his
face so tyler has had Kylie cosmetics on
his face before but we've never formally
tried them together that might have been
my only real foray into makeup
but I could not break in at school I'm
not going to let took me out take this
seat not gonna let it be Freddy I love
you Candace I want to go on to sitting
in here I want to try this makeup what
she was all about unlike this this what
is this what are behind those lips
looking at Picasso really delicious
aren't you thinking what's what's next
but kind majesty you know like high
destiny so the first thing we're going
to try is Kylie's diary press powder
palette do you want to do the honors of
course I do try let's see here hmm
here we go I'm get that second camera
shot there
here is the Kylie Jenner look at
basically her diary palette is like an
eyeshadow palette plus two blushes
joshan okay am I wearing this out
tonight if you would like to and you
guys want to do this in the description
below you'll see my going-out tutorial
you can check that one out it's pretty
good it's pretty good I haven't made it
yet let's start by watching all the
color so they can see the colors and
then we'll put a couple in our face
let's do it
you got a nice smokey blend there right
it looks nice metallic coming in with
this light pink one it's kind of got a
bubblegum flavor look oh it's a nice
smoky one I'm not getting anything on my
finger am i but I think I think we're
doing little I did not space it down
correctly couple my bicep by the end of
this psyche I was doing that to show my
bicep off guys don't worry about it
there you go guys
this is that up you guys getting a feel
for the color palette and there they are
they heartbreaker make me blush sweet
like candy love potion be mine heart
eyes romance and loves Mina I gave you a
couple of eyeshadow brushes that you can
do whatever you want with yep I wish I
was thinking about my nose meet you
actually visit those this turn you on
for Valentine's Day yeah it does what
about this wine one I want to let the
wine yes I thought okay so go in for
heart eyes title will be creating an eye
look using heart eyes and rum in so
eyeshadow goes above your eyes what do
you think yes get it too bad actually
anyway I don't know yeah
little that smoke your shade and credit
to your eye it's much harder to have one
eye closed and do this any other eye
that I thought yeah I think I cut apart
okay you're great you kind of opened a
runway model anyway like you kind of
look like you're doing some avant-garde
stuff it looks a little bit like an
allergic reaction turns out I'm allergic
to this and I have to grab an empty pen
to stick oh ha are you stab yourself in
the bitch you can't see it but there's a
little bit of a smoky contour there I
love it
you like it don't give me the credit
okay Kylie I'm going to use day because
I'm fitting away my BAE yeah BAE it's
kind of like a silvery shade like under
my brow bone to be honest League I'm not
someone who use this super bright
eyeshadow all the time but I do like the
mix of kind of like the token gray stuff
in with also like the really Valentine's
Day colors look it's hard to make a
Valentine's Day palette because it's
like red you don't want to just erase
the frosty blue really makes me feel
like it's really mid-2000 I went in with
romance in the crease and now I'm taking
heart eyes a little bit and putting it
on the outer corners I don't know really
what I did you like it it kind of feels
like once again kind of being on it this
is you don't eat on I'll win possible I
do go lean on got glitter in my eyes
what a lot that I avoid getting awesome
just I know what it did so much yes to
disco okay anyway it seems party yeah
yeah absolutely
the two blushes we have are called first
date and virginity anything virginity is
kind like a weird name for Valentine's
Day
it's almost like don't lose this tonight
oh I'll put first date on my face okay
I'll take virginity that's that's fine
so what am I keep doing with blush he
didn't say in general basically so what
I do with blush specifically like not
bronzer not contour blush oh here to go
for it yeah I'll just I'll figure it out
but kind of a joker by to this right now
like oh yes right I see that some people
just like to watch the world
I found it I found a ruby the shy about
tangerine - I'm I don't see anything
happened with blush really I see it I
see it I can't tell if there's anything
on my face right now
you look very pink right now so a
beautiful you kind of look like you're
drunk
oh so I would have a little Asian flush
I've had an obligate alien eye but like
normal cheek what's going on it's all
kind of coming together even though
virginity is a very weird name for a
blush I do kind of like the virginity
blush it's very kind of natural-looking
I like that you like it you can tell I
think it looks great
no idea what I'm looking for oh my god I
decide do you see the little like Auto
jammers so trunk so that's the highly
diary palette yeah now we get to move on
to the lips kit I don't have anything
actually
top high magic key for me I got both the
minis and the full-size lip kit so we
have eight let's kiss the swathers how
to stuff you really buy in Kyle a new
car huh okay the mini face can we stop
moving mini lipsticks right here oh
sorry I'll be like there's a lot of them
they look kind of cute keep this small
oh yes consumerism all the colors in the
mini kit she sells in full sizes I'm
pretty sure some of them are older
shades that she's like repackaged to be
in this kid some of them are her new
Valentine you asian-pacific with your
Valentine's Day only think it's all good
don't they smell like butter beer right
they've only butter beer
yeah the perfect fragrance if you go
over something that is butter beer yeah
maybe start at the top I'm terrible I
like water painting pesto you're doing
so well
I'm doing well yeah do that guys this
one Malibu I wanted
Malibu Barbie actually really like that
color yeah that color is sort of the
Safi stop me I try on makeup doing
anything for you uh sexually sexually
yeah I wouldn't call it a boner jam but
it's not 100% a boner kill gotcha
that's big this is poo DK like how like
one of my big hair is just sticking out
of it I love that I love that they went
from like long and skinny
- like shortens - they have sort of like
a alien marking
what about Pokemon they're called
unknown yeah they don't get on down
apricot
Malibu high maintenance cozy k
head-over-heels marriage okay these
shades are not up my alley necessarily
so I don't know that I would get this
kit
obviously they smell great and they have
they're kind of like the perfect amount
of lipstick if it's not your favorite
lipstick well I look at like a sampler
Konya if you go like a sports bar right
and you're going to get like some of the
chicken wings some of the jalapeno
popper it's a mozzarella stick oh my god
you don't really know what you want or
you're not willing to commit to like an
entire plate of mozzarella sticks then
you go with the minis alright so these
are the full-size ones
I am very excited because they know like
Kylie cosmetics goes back to the Kylie
Jenner lip kit that one's called
Valentine and this one's called
head-over-heels I'm a little bit
confused because head-over-heels is it a
full size and in the small one but
Valentine isn't a full-size but not
right so I don't know it's the exclusive
one ooh what's this there's something
else in here there's two things in your
sock yeah there could be two thing what
is this thing you have a lip liner oh
it's like that pencil thing this one's
called head over heels so one of the
ones that already we got in the mini set
maybe she just really like head over
heels and she was I wouldn't have it no
I think I think a Valentine is a
holographic Charizard the best part I
ever had was a holographic laparis
that's that's not that good this one
scares me this one is Valentine wow this
thing is really really pink that was
like Barbie girl in a Barbie world yeah
I don't like that at all I feel like out
of all these colors my actual favorite
is Malibu but I feel like for the spirit
of Valentine's Day we should do one of
the Valentine's Day colors so whichever
one you don't want help it on I'm glad
to put Valentine on my face all right
kind of like I'm gonna have to jump ups
or two this one I'm going to drag my guy
and really quick so this is the help you
draw the line yeah
I just told you about that good at this
stuff you're gonna do great so this is
head over heels what do you think oh it
was really pretty it kind of matches my
eyes I think it looks good so kind of
like make sense all together in a weird
way you fell on a sword for me thank you
for wearing balance
I kind of wish that I had chosen her
this is actually in the kind of
stressful sweet spot for me I am not
good at drawing I never have been good
at drawing that terrible handwriting not
Sogeti a thug I say mom's spaghetti
Tyler I thought they were what they moms
forget it forgetting you nervous
forget it mom stop talking about it like
how like squiggly my line is clearly I'm
like just like shaking as I do it this
is not that easy honestly I mess up
doing liquid lipstick all time you look
you look at Kylie Jenner you look like
we're anything a very attractive looking
yes I would tunnel my feet so eat it
that's like it terrible no before you
put the lipstick on actually look like
the look and now you love the look
flippin Valentine is a hard color to
pull off and you're nailing I think that
Tyler's look is more cohesive than mine
I think my look is kind of all over the
place
to be honest I mean I've got a theme
keeps sticking with that theme and risen
if I were going to name your look I
would name it
madam hoodie 50 shops which is where
Harriet Show had their date where
there's just like Valentine's Day
is where you wear pink red oh you want
more looks like this then check out my
tutorials you definitely have a xenon
vibe to it you recorded though is crush
or to be seen as computers there's only
a dude Disney vibe to you going on right
now
hi I'm Sofia and you're watching Sofia
Nygard YouTube channel overall what did
you think of Kylie's Valentine's Day
collection I thought there's a lot of
cool colors in there right as it is you
can kind of explore a lot of different
options and some I think that some of
these shades have rewear ability past
Valentine's Day I think some of them are
like really red and pink I don't think
you can do a neutral look with these
things they could be fun for a date
it could be fun for a party yeah it
could be fun for a rollerskating disco
yeah be fun for a lot of occasions so if
you're selling nude is your bright
colors it could be perfect for you thank
