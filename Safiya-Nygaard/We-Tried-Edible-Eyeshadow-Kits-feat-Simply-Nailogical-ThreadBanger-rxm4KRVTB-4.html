video so last week or I guess like two
weeks ago at this point we traveled to
New York City the Big Apple New York is
that how they are there speak Christine
and in New York losing our code for 10%
off for the YouTube creator summit where
we got to hang out with some of our
YouTube friends who for some reason
don't live right next to us like
Christine and Ben from simply illogical
and Corinne and Rob from threadbanger
and we all thought hey our travel
itineraries overlap like two days and we
have about six hours of collective
unbooked time let's try and film three
collab videos so we did and here is one
of them so about a year ago Christine
made this video testing out a children's
nail art water marbling science kit and
it turns out that this company project
mc-squared also produces an edible
eyeshadow science kit so I thought I
like bad makeup science Christine likes
children's toys and Corinne likes food
well most of the time so I bought three
of these edible eyeshadow science kits
and took them to New York with me where
we tried them and this is what happened
oh and yes this was before I cut and
colored my hair again
and also um if you're wondering where we
are right now we're actually in Tokyo
filming a bunch of videos so just pretty
much ignore everything that's happening
visually in this intro just focus on the
nonsense that's to come so I'm here with
Corinne from Fred banger and Kristine
from simply illogical Hollow and we're
gonna be supposedly making edible eye
shadow you've done this before right I'm
an expert at testing children's toys and
science of course in the name of same
mixin color science fil science eat so I
mean to be honest I've probably eaten
eye shadow before I feel like I end up
eating a lot earlier you know or just
something I just tasted yeah I do too I
think that's called its pica or
something where you feel like you have
to taste everything there
- ooh that my strange addiction episode
yeah as a person addicted to eating her
husband's ashes oh my god you could make
a shadow out of ashes to it you probably
definitely yeah grandma's eyeshadow all
right so it says cornstarch which is
derived from corn
imagine that Wow is a common ingredient
in lots of makeup by combining it with a
bit of powdered sugar and water you can
create a paste that works as an
eyeshadow base my favorite part of
actually the entire thing is that there
is no image on this box with the girl
with the eyeshadow on she looks the same
in the eat and in the where image ah
yeah I'm also curious to see how many
Instagram likes we might get out of this
oh that's a lot of lighting suggest here
that almost a million likes to fill your
eyeshadow palette I honestly went out
those but I love that the most likes
that she has is on just the palette
itself and not the photos of her awesome
so should we open these guys up I feel
like we've just been holding them in
like I'm very excited I can't just don't
show my nails otherwise Kristine will
roast me again do you want to open my
box
oh yeah Ben usually does it where's man
Tyler Keith help me excited this he
opened stuff sometimes there you go
great service thank you sir it's very
unclear what is actually included in
this there's a lot less in here than you
would think so we've got basically an
eyeshadow palette two measuring spoons a
little cup and some instructions look at
this gorgeous beveling
wow so chic so scientific where's the
milliliter so we've got all our crap out
and I think that are you are you can see
already broken it looks like the first
step is to get the cornstarch out which
I had to buy separately cornstarch
powdered sugar more sprinkles more
sprinkles
food coloring and more sprinkles there's
essentially nothing to this eyeshadow
kit except for just like a holder wait
wait this also says do not allow the
eyeshadow to come into contact with your
eyes I love when they say that yeah
that's really creepy and it's like food
coloring may cause temporary staining of
the eyelid or they probably the eyelid
all right so the first step is in a
mixing bowl pour 1 tablespoon of
cornstarch and 3 teaspoons of powdered
sugar do you notice how there's also no
measurements on any of these spoons
which one is the teaspoon I know the
instructions says tablespoon but which
one
yes they're both on the table that was a
terrible joke I'm leaving I said they're
both on the table so which one is the
tablespoon yeah and then I suddenly I'm
like someone has to leave all right here
here you go have some cornstarch vinegar
in here you go have your fix and then
yes the next thing after the potion
then the next step is 3 tea spoons of
powdered sugar so then it says to mix
with a spoon I feel we could just mix
like this to be honest oh yeah it
doesn't smell edible smells like home
depot or lowes sorry excuse me we'll
just bleep out what I say smells like
clothes Lowe's Home Improvement ok I'm
mixed as everyone mixed yep yep so this
next step is to pour 1 to 2 drops of
food coloring and mix with the dry
ingredients I'm gonna make purple what
color bitch you dyed your hair blue does
it sure that your color anymore that's
what the sweet colors sorry I can change
my color no no good soil so you can make
purple what where did it go there's no
way that's enough I said 1 to 2 drops
and I put 4 all right so I'm gonna do
orange so I'm gonna go Christine styles
and do 2 drops of yellow 2 drops of red
oh yeah it solidifies almost instantly
maybe it doesn't activate until you add
water I feel like the water is really
gonna help it it'd be nice if they
explained this science yeah I wouldn't
it to be about water
it just says pour a few drops in so oh
yeah that's not okay
what is a few boy that's a few that was
more than a few there you go there you
go that's a pace it's green oh I put too
much water just gotta go for it I'll
just add more of this a little bit more
pasty oh yeah like me
I'm pasty okay Oh could you wash our
hands first we didn't do that step what
wait where do we can wash our hands
under important information I love it I
didn't read any of them what's going on
there look at it it's like play-doh
Oh oh that look that looks good actually
oh I want to put this on my face it
smells like pancakes
Oh like like American pancakes well how
does the Canadian pancake smell rich
nice and real maple serve delicious is
there a difference besides the maple
syrup oh don't get hurt me okay so
Christine did a little too much so I'm
gonna do a less all right I am
definitely closer to to it that is weird
slime oh yeah all right all right man so
Gary that doesn't seem like enough ah
looks galaxy oh that looks pretty good
that's kind of cool I mean I think it's
gonna match my outfit really well do you
want to just film how this is expanded
look Wow yeah totally like a horror
movie
hold on it is growing at a rate two
point three three millimeters per second
good take note oh the metric system
we don't know what you're talking about
I'm digging I'm excavating I'm looking
for good content
Wow so the next step says asking adults
to wipe the compact clean we need an at
all
oh hello do you have science with you oh
that's a good better
Oh God the tacos what do you think he
ran away all right the next step is to
press down and flatten the mixture into
the container with clean fingers oh yeah
look at that
wait we should share yeah that's what I
was thinking we need it you know a
nicely balanced a color snoring maybe
that would be pretty that is what yeah
yeah yeah didn't you know that we're
actually all just nikkietutorials oh no
I actually am know so we decided to
share all of our colors so we could all
have like a complete palette but in the
meantime christine has powered ahead
Christine you are just secretly adding
things oh that does look pretty though
this one is a tide pod the earth is flat
the world is on fire and each a little
bit we know that Christine is a flat
earther all right here's our eyeshadow
palette this is what I have arrived at I
think that I tried to go Christie's
style and add some in but I think I miss
mess mine up too yeah I went awry
sabotage I'm a little bit confused as to
if these things are supposed to dry or
not because on the box it says let dry
but on the instructions it says nothing
of the sort
I don't know if we can trust or anything
I don't trust like doing believe her she
looks a little too happy so I think
actually looking at how this is drying
it's gonna take a little bit longer than
I thought to actually dry down into some
type of eye shadow something well we
can't put sprinkles on it and then kind
of like take it back to the hotel and
like leave it in the fridge overnight or
something I think that's good plan okay
so I think we're done making our eye
shadow palettes well there's still some
experimentation I got over here science
is never finished so I think we're going
to let them dry overnight and then in
the morning we're gonna just you know
put them on
and also eat them I am very hungry now I
know we had these tacos yeah sitting
right in front of us I also like that
Robin Ben came gave us tacos know then I
left yeah all right so I've brought the
eyeshadow kits back to the hotel room
and I'm gonna stick these in the fridge
and then maybe before we go to bed I'll
just take them out and leave them out to
dry I also want them to get some good
air - I don't want them to stay moist
all right so here are the eyeshadow
palettes after about 24 hours I know
that I said we tried them on this
morning but we kind of got busy filming
some other stuff so it's the next night
they did change a lot huh well um here's
the thing it was a lot prettier in the
car when I closed them they did get a
little messy yours was much more pretty
than it is currently but it's still
cleaner than both of ours so that makes
me happy better yeah the thing is they
don't seem to have gotten like super dry
in the way that I thought an eye shadow
would they're just sort of like crusty
are you eating it already sorry
Christine well it's weird because the
Box definitely step three was eat and
then step four was where how could you
wear it if you have already eaten it
penguin eye shadow rather you eat the
krill and then they regurgitate it and
they use that I think Tyler's trying to
science on this arraignment yeah stay
out
all right thought you want to grab the
camera please just come back please fill
this video for me I always say I was
slighted so we don't have to eyeshadow
brushes because I don't know
we all know that all right so what
should we eat it yeah cuz we got our
little excavators out of the side I'll
just use my fingers with my beautiful
name oh yeah you do have your own
excavators I want to try the purple one
because I feel like it will taste more
like grape all right for some reason all
right so it's supposed to kind of just
pop out but it's really scraping out
like it's almost like the insides aren't
actually hard the way the surface is oh
yeah
Kristine's is good I'm a scientist yeah
are you trying to take that out to eat
it that's the plan
cheers Cheers oh no that's a note from
me though it does not taste like grape
the weird thing is mine does taste like
grape yeah it's mental I'm telling you
it's synesthesia great it tastes like
baking powder to me it tastes exactly
like when you put too much powdered
sugar on top of fruit and you end up
like eating the wet powdered sugar yeah
that's like that's exactly what it
tastes like yeah it's not like really a
candy or like really food but it's it's
edible
exactly Christine is eating sprinkles I
like fun the sprinkles are edible okay
so it tastes okay but let's see how it
does as an eye shadow to the bathroom
together girls always go to back
together so we got on the bathroom here
all right so what it's out of the box
was to wet the brush then dip it in and
then put it on the eye okay
they also said to not have sprinkles on
so I need to freaking carve off some
sprinkles no fine all right so I've wet
my brush and I'm just kind of putting it
in here it does seem to have stained the
brush just a little bit so I'm just
gonna go like in the crease Oh
I'd be nervous too Mike
well there's color there it's more like
a very very pale i shadow milk and that
may be there for a couple days good I'm
glad that I placed that artful I
wouldn't know what happened if I just
patted it out a little bit oh yeah none
of the things that is coming right yeah
what do you think how do I look what do
you think damn it I didn't even need to
do it there's a little something every
you want to go next yeah I think I'm
gonna go for the purple great since you
did green there's something yeah that is
a corner and crease
I actually don't hate it I kind of like
that yeah it's a glassy look that's on
trend now actually the Aussie eyelid I
feel like when it dries it won't be as
glossy obviously you will it dry I know
it's kind of like dripping into my eyes
yeah it stings it's like sticky too so I
feel like my eyes sticking together
because of the sugar you know my eyes a
little Reds out I think that's like part
of that look though you know like I'm
gonna wake all night legs so my eye is
already watering because these ladies
are just so beautiful no allergies it's
hard being a baby area so I'm thinking
I'll put on some lipstick yeah you might
have to zoom into my lips I'm going I'm
going
very small oh that was a clump of
something it's that's all it is
oh wait we're getting some spread itch
if you rub your lips together it all
comes off I see a little stain Ajay
don't know I think it is almost
definitively a better lipstick than an
eyeshadow okay
- it feels drying though that's what I'm
noticing like this is like a liquid
lipstick but drier and I hate no when I
- it definitely it starts feeling like
sticky no one will want to make out with
me oh that's not true Christina we can
still make out come here show gallop all
right so those were our edible eyeshadow
kits I think as eyeshadows they were
like a little bit disappointing I think
that the smoky color looked a lot better
I didn't hate it but unfortunately like
the sugar and the pain as the sugar
enters your eye doesn't seem worth it it
does I think as lipstick though
obviously it's not ideal but I think it
makes more sense than as eyeshadow kind
of because if the plan was to eat it
anyway then it's a lot closer cuz were
you gonna like lick her eye or something
not really make sense right shall I
it might be a little weird I think that
as a science toy this definitely
disappointed me there was nothing in the
thing that said anything about science I
didn't learn anything but I couldn't say
it
I do think that I shadow science is a
cyber Slayer but the emulation of makeup
overly but what is this this is not that
no no just any little tidbit would have
been better than what we got which was
barely any instruction othing yeah no
actual affirmation because girls can't
handle that this is true despite what
you've seen here today
