video today I'm here with Candace and
we're going to take on the Instagram
trend of feathered eyebrows makeup
artist Stella
sir Onan accidentally started this brow
trend on Instagram a couple of weeks ago
she says
note to self when you make a joke about
starting a funny brow trend people will
take it seriously and well start the
trend so she didn't really mean for this
to be a trend but now people are doing
it yes so we have become a trend I think
when I find it funny about this we were
just talking about this was that one
some things on Instagram it's like
automatically a trend and I remember
being at work and people are like have
you heard about into the ground oh my
god it's the next big thing I was like
is it well that's the question so we're
going to be trying out these feathered
brows and then going out and seeing what
you guys have to say about these
feathered brows and if anyone would ever
really want to wear these yeah do we
have we have a lot of items we put this
brow gel and then like hair gel and then
hair wax
she used a glue stick but after past
experiences with glue and eyebrows I
decided again it's just like no glue and
then we've got just a couple of like
eyebrow combs and schoolies she just
like smooth some of them up and some of
them down and just like how to seam in
the middle I don't know how she do that
though I've been trying to grow these
out for a little bit as soon as you told
me we're doing the video so I like my
best Bush brow on right now I was
thinking maybe I'll just like take this
and then just start brushing it and then
add in a bit of spoolie once I got it
where I want it to really cement it down
a bit
boys I'm gonna go the wax method okay
you're kind of wait I wasn't feel like
I'm going to candle I said oh it's
working already
yeah maybe I'll do it you're doing
because I don't know if it's working for
me but getting it down god that's
Haller's okay it looks am i working
Oh yours is a good theme already like I
can eat many hard I'm like kind of press
it down I'm gonna take this wax and just
put it on the suely and see if that will
do anything for me oh you're right this
lassies worth that this is much more fun
than the furry lips oh my god this very
lifts were very itchy from the beginning
and I'm still like coughing up fiber as
why is the bottom is hard you're pushing
it in the opposite direction of where it
wants to go yeah I'm trying to use this
brow comb as if it were like a real toll
parting my hair okay so I've got one but
what if one brow is longer than the
other then we'll all see all right I've
got one brow down it's a little red
because I've been spooling it it is a
little red little inflamed
oh well mine really just looks like a
centipede like a really like a feathery
the fuzz like a feather like a feather
Candice has already moved on I'm moving
on to Brown number two I just don't like
an old man on this one my brow 2 is just
not having it it's hard to find this
crease we should do it with our stash
hairs oh my god wait I don't know about
my stash is long enough right my chest
waxed like that
next up feather moustache don't take
that idea it's ours why is the second
one so hard for me because like I've got
a good part here and this one is just
kind of like remaining all right do you
think anyone will want to talk to us
it's hard cuz especially at the front of
the brow the brows definitely want to go
up like they don't want to go down are
you out of breath I've been like holding
my breath I think that I'm ready to
throw in the towel here I think that the
second eyebrow was a little bit harder
to find the seam on for me I don't know
if I just have more brow on the right
side but this is the finished product
I think the world needs to see these I
think this would look great on the
runway I don't know about IRL
but the runway yes even though Stella
sir Onan was joking I think that she's
kind of onto something when I first saw
them I was like ooh no but when I looked
at them for a while I was like it's kind
of cool in its own way it is I think
that we should go out and see what
people think because I think that we've
gotten really excited sitting here and
we need a reality check
yeah I'm like I'm feeling myself as
people didn't be like get out okay I'm
trying to see if
oh it's kind of darkness oh there we are
yeah I don't know I don't hate them it's
very great for Halloween I feel like
everything it's like just save it for
Halloween save it for a costume digital
here are the brows in the light of day
they look much more magnificent actually
in the daylight I think Candice let's
see what yours look like how are they
looking
this is just so much better than our
furry lips like I'm interested the funny
thing is like I think that it feels so
much better than furry lips and free
lips have got crunchy feeling oh yeah
you know as very comfortable I think
that this is a very high visual impact
like book yeah well the classic cover
yeah mostly hello just feel like it a
little bit like you got into like a wind
tunnel or just did some like bungee
jumping or something I just got so
freaked out our eyebrows just like
displayed in half like ah wah wah Oh
Johnny rocket chair get her out of hot
dogs does this just be my tradition yes
all right let's go see let's post up
somewhere and see what people have to
say
we're here with marina and joy and
they're going to tell us anything card
with an eyebrow
if you try help
like
you guys wouldn't result Audrey this
makes me regret events like this people
the higher line you know like are you
getting up crap on my eyebrows on to do
I feel like I want married ironic
okay so we got one yes just get ready
sir yeah - yes is on kind of a like if
you ever do something fun and then we
got if you know one mate and then three
no yeah a lot of mixed answers here to
them like critical I think they're cool
in their own way other than everyday
trend but we got like a fishing disease
would fly I think we're going to find
that one tiebreaker and is really ask
music business
five games up he'll demand our hearts my
trainer
do you think it's a trend any other
thank you mentally birthday everyone
happy birthday to Amanda she's our
tiebreaker and she said yes all right so
we got some people to share their
opinions with us I think overall it was
pretty mixed but I think the yeas have
it like people were down for it in a
kind of avant-garde occasion Halloween
type way I meant first very surprised
there were some media yeah cuz I feel
like drought can be such a polarizing
subject you know like you want to do
them like perfectly or like people have
their different methods there's
something to this trend that's like kind
of playful and carefree or it's like I'm
just going to differently we're with my
brows and not care if they're perfect
and just kind of like feather them out I
don't think that this is an everyday
look but I do think like it's kind of
fun I know Sal was kidding but I do
think it could be a trend in its own way
maybe contained mostly to Instagram so
wearing it in real life like it was it
was fine I admit feel like all that
there's so many memes and everything
that are like when you look at a girl
and you just want to fix her brows or
something yeah and it's like I always
get a little self-conscious like just in
case people are looking at my brows you
can like have an excuse now to have
unkempt brows I'm just doing feather
brow yeah it's the trend they're
definitely not sisters they're
definitely not twice a second off
they're distinct unrelated Centipede I'm
doing it on Tyler really quick and I
just we had to show you guys it's he's a
browser like perfect for it I think this
is kind of a counter to the very welcome
to breath yeah the unkempt brow it may
be the age of the unkempt brow who knows
that's how it works right
yeah they ping-pong back and forth Tyler
Oh Tyler your brows are so feathered
