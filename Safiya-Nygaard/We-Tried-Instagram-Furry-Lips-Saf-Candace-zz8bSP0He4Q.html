we're doing it in two worth people to be
doing this
hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm here with Candace we're
going to be doing some hard-hitting
investigation here today we saw a couple
headlines that said that furry or fuzzy
lips some people who can calm velvet
velvet furry fuzzy lips are a trend that
people are doing we are here to try
these furry lips then we're going to go
and see if we can find anyone who will
give us their real opinion on these
furry lip and I don't say that the
images of people doing it it looked cool
makeup artist Greta Agassi
I'm very sorry Greta I pronounce your
last name wrong she uses to get this
textured what looks the cap on the
everlasting with it lipstick and some
loose velvet typically used for nail art
called 3d flocking powder lock it's so
close to fleek but it's a little off my
lips are on clock it looks like a belly
button lint it does it kind of like
someone designed to shave like a stuffed
animal at night and didn't take all its
work what is your method I don't I have
no method currently I'm just gonna go
section by section and I want it to dry
before I can put them on right how do I
spend my everyday okay well then you're
evil oh it's on my teeth it's all over
my teeth Oh God oh no one comfortable I
don't want to read it I don't want to
inhale I'm scared to lick my lips and
they're getting so dry you can't lick
your lips at all it's over so doing this
maybe if I swallow it'll just give me
some fiber in my diet kind of some
roughage you know this is kind of hmm
you know when you wear a like dark
colored sweater or shirt over your
freshly shaved armpit and then when you
take it off you have like really weird
lint in the armpit so it looks like you
have hair there yes and I feel like it
all doesn't look funny on my lips it's
like what is that
besides the fact that I look like a
muppet who has mange I like this color
the pressure got to me the application
I'm shoddy if you think it looks
anything like what's the
real makeup artists look like I don't
think so I think I need more fuzzy stuff
it does cover up my stache though it
distracts from the south it's like do
you think that's funny
take a look down here I think I'm at
maximum fluff you really you nailed it
in real life you can tell if locked but
on camera it looks like I've tried like
100 layers of lipstick but not all
makeup looks are meant to attract a mate
like some makeup look for just meant to
be like avant-garde and cool but instead
of telling us where one might wear this
you know I mean where would I go I will
say though that I thought that the
application wasn't that hard but then
you have to look at the results and say
you guys aren't makeup artists you
didn't do this that well so even if it's
not that hard did you achieve it I don't
know that we did Tyler actually just a
walk back in the house we're going to go
see if he is willing to kiss me and
we're going to the mall and see if we
can find anyone who's going to give us
their honest opinions of what they think
of our flock list yeah be honest people
stop you're doubtful about the hairy
buckle whip oh a blue eye are you but oh
what see actually I'm pretty curious see
ya what does it like Oh God gives me a
doormat
was it really that bad yeah I have to
walk as a back of my throat and it's
making me cough we're in the car heading
to the mall Candace how you doing I'm
shedding honestly I'm molting there was
like probably like five minutes where we
had all of our fluff on and none of it
was falling off it looks pretty bad in
daylight it does kind of have a cool
color kind of looks like the bottom of
the sea for you ah ah oh my god look at
this giant chunk that just came off me
and I imagine your whole body being
covered in this that's what cats feel
like Candace how do you feel
is blowing off the escalator my dues in
the Elena Parliament risk of its neck
will never try to eat burritos
no that's to me and I got the cinnamon
sugar mini donut I'm going to see if I
can fit one in my mouth it's too hot
in case any flock
you have good
oh that would call it
another swish Black Mamba
blacklist victory but is there sugar on
my lips
well there's perlier let's not have you
know that let's see if anyone's willing
to tell us the truth
actually I'm not sure that anyone will
notice really I think we're going to
have to ask them to really take a cool
guy ate Alison's what do you think of
our lips
so what kind of crusty you've had like a
darker colors or like a brighter car
who is better you can't see it okay I'm
your Catherine
ever done zzf thousand one oh hi okay so
we have a yes and we have a no we need a
tiebreaker we need a tiebreaker right
now so whoever whatever the next person
says is the be-all end-all what do you
think happy will you arrive it
yeah Natalie the tiebreaker Natalie says
no I said no no I said no do not lead
okay so we're getting a hot dog I don't
know what you guys are telling me that
mine looks good - patchy as hell oh my
god that's why we're getting hot dogs to
celebrate truly celebrate our
accomplishments today Candace how you do
with your hot dogs I'm eating a hot dog
and it's all over just kind of game up a
little bit but it doesn't taste like
anything this furry lip thing I think
there was a moment today where it looked
good I think there was a moment where it
looks kind of fun and then after about
10 minutes to start pilling like a
little bit wetter but their's are coming
off in like huh I think it's for
photoshoots runways and Instagram so
Candace what do you think would you do
this again I think for our cost you
might do it again but nah I don't think
that I would do this again - we're
around for a full day but if we want to
do something fun and weird for an
Instagram I would do it again okay I'm
