will be I don't think there will happen
it will be rainbow there is a pill that
makes you poop glitter will have to do
that one next
hello friends and welcome to another
video where we are going to be trying
Instagram rainbow bagels in comedian
Tyler's rules for vlogging here's step
one point all the time and after you
vortical hand gestures Julia Roberts
Julia robbed her so I thought he'd
rainbow bagels on Instagram probably
honestly like over a year and a half ago
and I've seen them consistently on
Instagram and online since then I've
seen a few sync pieces okay thank you
maybe more like a artifice and every
time I see it I'm like that looks crazy
I wonder what it tastes like
I want one the other thing is like it
has been at least a year and a half I
think since they were released it's not
exactly trendy right now but I've seen
them so many times that I really want to
go get them subscribe this channel to
see us try out trends a year late
so we're visiting Tyler's sister in New
York over the holidays and I thought
what a great opportunity to find these
rainbow bagels I know they're somewhere
in Brooklyn somewhere out there
somewhere over the rainbow okay they're
getting regular bagels
yeah we're going to go the Train we're
not going to Brooklyn and we're guessing
rainbow bagels once and for all
we're enroute in route on the roof I'm
very excited I've been waiting so long
for this motor hungry
did not do that oh you're walking up
normal
the bagel store it looks like there's
nowhere to sit muscular just standing
outside that's okay we made it out to
Brooklyn to get the bagels there is a
crowd outside of the bagel store though
though it seems like they are still
doing well or shot maybe even more when
it's raining at the end of the rain you
don't recover the bagel and I'm soaked
to finally get these things after
wanting them from Instagram for like two
easier Instagram has been tossing me
intagram and if you named Jonathan
Jonathan Cheban yeah it got his name I
know he's friends with pronouncing
hostiles can connect with Luigi's bagels
he's not eating the rainbow bagel he's
repeating it take why does this happen
before it being really raining outside
and kind of like a random day it's
pretty crowded in here I can imagine on
like a nice day on like a weekend it is
very very very crowded so what I've seen
under green bow bagels is if you get
kind of like a sprinkle me like son
study type cream cheese and it's kind of
looking desserts people I know you can
put other things on the bagels but I
think that what I would want is just the
full experience I'm not going to get
that he just ordered and I'm pretty
jazzed to get it I'm really good yeah
I'm really gener how I said it I was
until I got here and I saw I got the
classic rainbow people upon Cudi and
Tyler got the new year's bagels for us
with New York purple silver and classic
black with edible gold stars in clarify
can we get a biggy they can choose I'm
really hungry that's my real time here
can you actually use it like a normal
baby it might be really weird I'm
excited for how the bagel looks I hope
it tastes like a normal baby I don't
said we want a normal bagel afterwards
I'm telling you I think it's just going
to be food color you know it's like
coca-cola is actually clear when they
put like the brown poop going in there
to make it look more Carl moly yeah I
hope it tastes like a rainbow birdie
lucky charm sure taste the rainbow
skittles though so it's really crowded
inside and it's raining outside so we're
going to go back to Tyler sisters apart
hanging out and even the faculty
struggle faculty our faculty call you
okay so we are here in Tyler sister's
apartment we have our rainbow bagels
we've been waiting for a little while
they might be a little cold but okay the
asbestos Philippines I just can't
believe we have even our hands finally
after all these years I think the guy
said it was like sort of vanilla flavor
right but to me it looks like a giant
screw glue I didn't think they were
supposed to taste any different I was
just god I think it doesn't taste like a
dessert maple I was like wait you get
like a pig Ooty then I'm like a
McGriddle right now I'm gonna put the
meat on it whatever it's just a mixing
things together savory sweet works all
the same I think is at first I thought I
was you know doing the authentic thing
and getting the funfetti but now seeing
Tyler's breakfast bagels makes me really
hungry real food
just fell on the ground Cheers I'm not
sure the egg and the bake was you at all
it's not a different consistency that
other tables what I can tell you about
this is that the funfetti cream cheese
it's freaking amazing photo I can't
really taste the bagel at all
I'm just getting fun Betty cream cheese
and it's awesome although it's basically
like better frosting because frosting
too sweet so this has some cheese in it
yeah
when frosting gets too sweet this just
keeps it a little and FX hours as she is
the sour cream cheese flavor the bagel
is aesthetically hilarious I want to
take it Instagram with it it's really
fun G inside I be baking this just to
get a bite of Tyler it's not bad right
it just doesn't taste like it's supposed
to be like that no exactly that's
exactly right because like it still
tastes like eggs and an exit a which is
eggs and cheese and for my bacon so if
that tastes good
it's delivery to college it's like I'll
gather a bit different aesthetically it
actually definitely exceeds expectations
they're adorable like they're your
shooters little sweetness ever and you
do want to eat them so it's really worth
going to and trying out I mean it looks
like a scooby-doo like Mystery Machine
it's literally to pimp my ride is the
exhibit big will I replace all of my
bagels with rainbow bagels because you
still need
except you need to everything everything
but it's super fun to look at and it's
funded just for the novelty of it thank
