video
I'm here with Candace and today we're
going to be trying out Instagram toilet
paper lip art our girl Greta agasi back
at it again she was the one who I think
started or at least like propagated the
Instagram fairy lip art trend she struck
back instruction to stroke once more
with some toilet paper this time I saw
it and I thought it was really
interesting and I didn't know what she
is and then I enter caption she's like
lol I use toilet paper I don't like what
how did was this done it's cool it kind
of looks like your lip is like shedding
some newborn skin so basically look
Greta youth is liquid lipstick lip
topper like she used an iridescent lip
topper and toilet paper I brought that
toilet paper because I just from the
Costco and got literally a pallet of
toilet paper
I have toilet paper don't lose right now
I really try this out people can't do
something then we're going to go out and
see what people think of this trend cool
so to be honest I think last time we had
like more directions I think you know
time is a little more freeform okay so I
just slide that really quick no wonder
this is having a visual representation
it almost appreciated like bear lip and
then she's got the toilet paper kind of
crinkled up on her lips and then she
kind of like puts the iridescent stuff
over it yeah I'm just going to put a
little bit of like eyelash glue on my
lip I brought the the eyelash glue just
because last time like I feel like we
had to reapply the floc a lot to clarify
this is not a tutorial on how to do this
I'm just trying to figure out any way to
put toilet paper on our lips for the
sake of art we're by no means
professionals okay so far less of a risk
of ingesting eyelash glue as ingesting
toilet paper I have to cover the
butthole I put you know instinctively
put the toilet paper into my waterline
but it's already dissolving mine looks
like this right now see the problem is I
went in and things were going well and
then - ended up being really wet I've
got a wet mouth I don't know what to say
I want to like my much so bad and I can
feel the spit in my corners like being
soaked up you look wonderful already now
you're lying
so Candice is doing the approach where
she did her whole bottom lip I am going
to do like my whole toilet paper and
then I'm going to go in
the lipstick and the lip topper after
sorry might be the first time I ever
like truly fail one of these I'm seeing
failure on memorize the Barrett Mandela
on the flip side I've never worn blue
lipstick before okay okay do you have my
tiny baby severe yes I was just using
them to cut my eyebrows we shouldn't get
tiny baby scissors that's a good idea
I'm going to grab my tiny baby scissors
tiny baby sis scissor tiny baby scissors
are we're sat not sponsored these are
just really great this one half of a
sheet of toilet paper is actually
probably going to be enough for me it's
funny because you know toilet paper is
usually on the other end of your body on
a different set of lips I just thought
that had its way now I just understood
that I'm raunchy I'm now kind of olive
even putting eyelash glue on top almost
like paper mache it down yeah this does
feel very much so like an art project
more than the other ones that we've
tried actually this one
we all are creative Liberty make me
laugh and is it's going to come off is
gonna come off
okay I'm going to take this and then I'm
also going to do some trimming I feel
like I look almost like Santa hopefully
once we put the iridescent stuff on top
it'll look more like great I feel like
that's gonna happen so I think we're
gonna have a hard time talking to people
because I'm moving my mouth saying
alright so I'm finally I think ready for
the liquid lipstick I don't know what
I'm doing I'm kind of like slightly
dusting this liquid lipstick going
that's basically what I did I just
dabbed it on your iridescent thing is
pretty light and mine's kind of like a
little bit darker so I'm going to try
and do more of my iridescent stuff it
does look like I got like surgery on my
lips and I've put bandages just on my
lips I'm just like maybe I can cover it
up with lipstick I think I probably have
to do some trimming after I'm done with
this stuff
I like the shimmer top it's kind of
working I am into the shimmer the short
one I'm just going for it
is you know I can't smile all the way
the glue is dry and you
yes I am feeling like a little less
stress you know I'm arts and crafting
right now there is something that's kind
of fun about it like it's almost comics
just be painting anything I'm just
painting a bookshelf mm-hmm just kidding
a toilet paper on my mouth this is my
finished look there is something about
it that almost looks like something like
they do look a little more voluminous I
also like mine looks look like a geode
you're just pretty cool and graphic when
I get up close it's so hard to like get
clean edges on this god how is she doing
Gretta how do you do it help us
something about that glitter iridescent
stuff like really just makes it all okay
if we were going for toilet paper lip
art we did something with toilet paper
on our lips so we're going to go out and
ask some people what they think of this
maybe try need a hot dog and see if
Tyler will kiss me are you trying to
smile I'm trying smile yeah I kind of
did a half smile let's go I feel cool
you ain't gave me a kiss no I'm sorry
I'll kiss you again
and they keep hoping and praying it all
come off I think something that we
haven't really talked about with this
lip art trend is the question that we
usually ask which is is this a trend we
all just have to like talk about like
what what constitutes a trend for a lot
of these things that are written about
like this is a new makeup trend like the
number of people doing it to think he's
written about it ratio is very low
they are shimmery they're nice they are
getting drier and getting a little hard
but it's fun and I feel like my artistic
miss went up a little bit I feel like
I'm very mermaid and you're very galaxy
this I know that's right we're here
we've got a couple hours of daylight
left we're going to see if anyone's
willing to come close enough so really
hectic this is a good tactile one touch
it doesn't feel very strange I kind of
put you on glasses a very bright lip
color I didn't even really notice until
right hey everyone I'm here we're going
to post up and try and talk to people
and then get some three okay we're here
with Jeff Gunn Katie this is on a
Instagram lip art trend called toilet
paper lipstick yet so this texture is
actually toilet paper
that sounds uncomfortable if you need an
education look like drugs or a chair all
right now would you ever drive it for
Hollywood
like how busy that with McLaren it was
like start conversation like on my fav
college like oh I've been there I have
five used toilet paper it doesn't feel
like my like yeah it's like crispy oh
it's the you guys think that this is a
could be a trend you can just could
catch on when people start doing an
educator if you're turned in somebody
found a way to like no quiet or free all
the work you can use people might like
this
I mean go little bit
no no-one liking me so far I wonder if
it's because they're kind of slowly
coming on I think in terms of Instagram
lift Ranas this one is aesthetically my
favorite I also think that we have made
people the most uncomfortable with them
I think that once you say the word
toilet paper people are like oh yeah I
don't think I want that maybe we should
not say whatever yeah we should ask like
one person and not tell them that as
toilet paper and see if they think is
better yeah I think the beer was going
and Mel
listing of our lip art you can take a
gander at mine at birth what do you guys
think
okay that's close because I maybe try
something like this and yeah like you
like it
I like that so I'm a little water so
it's made out of coiled paper
does that change your opinion on it at
all that's a maybe people just think the
same of it no matter what if we got
volunteer you still okay with it are you
thinking for staff okay nobody likes it
everyone seems way more weirded out
about this and I thought that they would
be I think it's because it looks like
our lipstick on fire yeah just throw it
away it's feeling I'm pretty sure it's
going to come off when we start to eat
so ty this moment of truth I just want
to peel it off I know you actually
disguise the kids with it try and grip
it with your now I won't do that ready
Oh came back for a second not because
they wanted to I'm trying to check the
out okay it's really horrible
alright really reciprocate and you have
a piecing action to this margin with my
mouth so I was just kind of like a
sprinkling yeah it was a great kiss if
anything I would even prefer the Ferrari
looks to that but it feels like crinkles
hard toilet paper and I put my lips
again three times
we got like noodles humid in general
stuff it's definitely not as good pop
safe as it was began its kind of
self-healing I think that we just got to
take a good bite and see the damage and
then I think we've just peeled off the
only and then when I open my mouth to
eat that I felt extracted I think it
failing every test except for how fun it
is foot off this is a big bite as we eat
the toilet paper becomes wetter in
photos starts kind of not peeling off or
just disintegrating slowly
I'm yeah oh oh a chassis that's a good
image alright ready for the top it's
like it's making an end table yeah
it's like he's molting oh the eyelash
glue really helps so much glue oh I
can't wait to get this off well you
really take that on whoo and other guys
I ate a smurf here's wasn't dirty
lines like softly it's pretty big quiet
smile again I can talk yeah okay so
that was that it feels so good right now
it was very satisfying to peel off
honestly could be worth it just to like
peel it off maybe the next trend is
peeling this stuff off I mean it's all
moan or video mmm yeah if there's a
little slime element to it for fun just
get the ten out of ten outside opinions
and tests it gets like kind of a zero
yeah but like I had a good time I
thought it was bad but I also have a
case so I don't necessarily think it's
every natrone but mark my words there
will be feel torn from live videos from
