how we did that it looks like we just
wrecked a Sephora and he just ruined
everything
hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm here with Candace hey
and we're going to be trying peel off I
shadow I feel like I've heard of peel
off I shadow
I definitely seen some other youtubers
do videos maybe not on this exact
product but on peel off I shadow in
general basically I ordered these peel
off i shadow things from color on pro
and they send you basically like a
packet full of eyeshadows we're going to
try it out today and then it all goes
well we're going to try it out tomorrow
as part of our routine to see how long
it lasts how much time do you spend the
eyeshadow when you do it um probably
like five minutes but you don't do it
every day
no I use a very like neutral tone I'm
into that in a lot of like eyeliner I
don't do a lot of eyeshadow but I love
when I do it yeah sometimes if I feel
like doing it I'll put like a little bit
of like my contour color even
mine crease or like in the corner just
to kind of like add some definition for
a true eyeshadow look it takes me a
little while because I am very very
nervous about being unwanted right I
will like if you think work it could
save you a ton of time I got two packs I
think one is more like neutrals and
visuals for like tropical it definitely
does look a little bit like a PowerPoint
presentation
oh yeah it does look like 90 bees like
WordArt I'm going to open my pack to but
it looks like Candace's pack of the
tropicals are just watch one in general
I am interested to see how long it stays
on they give you a few sets of the
eyeshadow peel off and then like a
little setting powder and it will be
crush okay
also my brush doesn't cut all the way do
you see you know that's the goal looks -
yeah he's kind of having a good time
okay I have a visa no J and L oh like 11
I don't really know I think I might go
for this purple and brown I got like a
Bulbasaur color a brown and teal color
and a brown and sky-blue color why feel
very nice Blastoise honest maybe I'll
try this like deep green I'm not really
a green
Merson so we shall see what no oh it's
like goopy it's like it feels like
foundation kind of like a really gummy
foundation does it put it above our
eyelid planner uh uh uh oh I'm I'm so
nervous
everything good oh don't mind me I'm
just putting on my makeup right and then
they said from the inside out peel oh my
god oh my god whoa whoa I could help I
think you work it is way more intense
than I thought it would be okay so it
says off to blend with your finger
oh it is blending actually very nicely
all right so we're just going to take
our little bit of trends' was on the
other this makes it mattifies it's all
falling into my eyelashes I will say
though I'm looking at soft little
workstation over this is a lot messier
than just applying eyeshadow yeah right
here I did something bad right here it's
just a little too Brown like I wish
there were more purple you know aha
eighties / incest no I want to change my
course you should know and I have that
one criminal alternative blue mom
spaghetti and Candace mine Makris are on
Amelia payment alright okay
Oh doesn't happen to me whoa I don't
know how you did that I'm going to try
and pull this up and see if I can use it
to the paint brush kind of I think this
is one of those things like with all
makeup is nice practice makes perfect
yeah because you have to place it it's
like you got one shot if you played it
wrong like you're not having a good day
I think the mermaid color is the clear
winner today this is definitely very
pigmented it blended very well I like
more of an oily lid mmm so it'll get
like stuck in those creases and I wonder
if this would do that because it already
has that kind of oiliness to it these
I'm a little disappointed I'm getting
some crease already okay so here is
South Beach
here is L to provide hey I don't know if
they take it with me or if it was
suspenseful but Anna came on poop light
I think that this the bright colors come
out well with these again the neutral
colors can just come out a little muddy
so Candace is going to take the black
smokey eye and I'm going to take my
South Beach which is this look and we're
going to try and do this like as part of
our regular makeup routine and wear it
for a full day and see if it lasts
I am very like pleasantly surprised with
how well it doesn't look like out when
smoothly but it did go very smoothly it
could even work yes good morning friends
so the one that I am going to put on is
this one South Beach this is this is the
real world you know the table in my
living room that's the studio this is
the bedroom where things get real oh I
just got some one my fingers I put a
little bit of primer potion on usually
when I do my eyeshadow I do it before
any of like my face makeup so now would
be the time so I'm putting it on the
problem a little bit is that the shape
of the eyelid is not the same as my
shape okay well wait that one's actually
really pigmented maybe I just forgot how
pigmented these were it doesn't really
get all the way to the end of my eye it
just gets kind of like to here so I'm
going to just use a little brush and see
if we can just kind of like manipulate
it a little bit so that's number one
alright this is what the first one looks
like umm it's a little gray to me but I
messed up and applied it to deep into my
corner but I'm going to clean it up and
blend it out and see what it looks like
Oh getting a little filtrate tonight I
number two putting the brown part at the
bottom once more oh my god it's coming
off on its own until it off from the
inside why do I feel like that one was
worse I was too busy trying to take some
male faces oh gosh
but I do my eye shadow before my
foundation for a reason so that's easily
fixable and it's actually better to take
the paint off of this to fix your
mistakes
I just set it using this get best powder
where I just take the brush I don't
actually pronounce brush proof
just kind of started coming out like
maybe I want some bruschetta and
hopefully this will keep it from
creasing throughout the day I'm going to
finish my makeup now and just try and
clean up this little poop well it looks
like I just tried to kill the Grim
Reaper ear that's the problem is that
I'm it's all over my hands and it's so
sticky but I was good okay so I'm done
with my makeup I actually have to run I
actually really do like the way the
eyeshadow looks right now
we'll see in a couple hours how it turns
out but in my bedroom it looked kind of
like Murphy and outside like you can
really see the blue once this stuff is
on your face and doing its thing it's
acting pretty much like normal
eyeshadows so this is a final love it's
actually a little bluer than I thought I
thought it would be super dark black I
am NOT positive this will stay on all
day but we'll see we are a couple hours
in and I think I'm doing pretty well I
am noticing though that this eye is
bluer than this eye what you're really
going to do about that so I've had to
makeup on for like eight hours at this
point and I honestly think that the rest
of my makeup is doing worse than my eye
shadow I wouldn't snackin so the butt
hole lip is out my face is getting a
little shiny so you know honestly the
eye shadow is really holding up quite
well I won't say a couple things
I'm not naked um I was complimented
today people are like you look so nice
like what did you do for your eye makeup
and I was like it's a stay out so it's
been like 10 hours since I put on my eye
shadow and there is a tiny amount of
creasing but not much barely noticeable
I was going to say my first knowledge
nice I was pretty cute
thanks babe yeah is that going to be the
blog
I did get some creasing if you can see
which was my main concern I think that's
because I have an oily lid so I'd be a
personal growl autofocus damn it there
you go
honestly the worst thing you can say
about it is that it maybe has faded
throughout the day like I am actually
incredibly impressed by the longevity of
this eyeshadow I came into this thinking
that they might be quick to apply but
quick to fade and they're actually a
little bit more difficult to apply or at
least more time-consuming to apply than
one might think but they last a freaking
long time I would say that I would maybe
do this again I am impressed by how long
it lasts and I would feel actually
pretty comfortable wearing this pretty
much anywhere I didn't run a mile in it
but I did eat some spicy curry in it
