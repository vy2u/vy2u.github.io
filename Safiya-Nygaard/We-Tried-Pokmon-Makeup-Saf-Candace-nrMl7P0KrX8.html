media nation my girlfriend hello oh my
God look sign is oh hello friends and
welcome to another video today we are
going to be trying purple makeup I'm
wearing my Jigglypuff shirt it's like a
squished dead jiggly so well you might
call me no Candace or maybe you do it
but here's Candace so I'm excited I've
been obsessed with Pokemon since I was a
little kid I was a big Pokemon snap girl
everyone stay yohio gee I always chose
Charmander I have a giant pillow no not
like Vic thing I was always a Bulbasaur
kind of gown I played yellow Ruby and
then I play leaf green I had a gay boy
this as P at that time and I don't know
where it is the best thing was my life
so I would just stay up all night
Clinton and then if my mom would be like
I'd be like get out like hide little
lighted screen under my pants go ahead
I'm mayor campus manager I went online
because I heard about this Pokemon
makeup but I hadn't seen it anywhere and
I found most of it on Amazon from what I
can tell it's not really sold in the
u.s. right now but it's freaking
adorable it is the cutest awesome ever
seen in my life should we try the eyes
yeah I have the Pikachu eye palette look
at this this eyeshadow palette will put
you right to sleep it's literally the
same as a box oh it is exactly that is
exactly it's a really cute and small
though
okay so yours are actually pink you're
in the kind of like his back in March is
dry so if you were like a literal mouse
this would be Pikachu colors
I've got like a rose gold me Disney I
would name this frock search oh my
alright the charmander foot ashes hopes
and dreams so we've got a little like
star power here with Jigglypuff to
choose one
yes just go a bit not the really red
things on a cheap suit but we've got
some wheels in here and why not put a
little of Jigglypuff startup all over
the lid and now I'm going for a Ash's
hopes and dreams so put a little bit of
Pikachu's blood in the inner part of my
eye and then I went with a Brock first
kind of on the outside of my eye and
into the crease I like it I mean they
blend nicely together the nice colors I
feel like these that very much you could
find these in Kylie's birthday palette
or the - great speech palette when
someone sold out and then I'm glad it's
not just yellow eyeshadows but I kind of
wish were more seemed like yellow red
and brown you know I mean like every
Pikachu
maybe we should go out and make and have
a full-on power exactly make more of it
nobody takes that that's our idea we're
going to make a Pokemon palette I think
there is copyright issues we'll call it
something else off brands but you'll
know it slowly we'll call it Digimon
Digimon
do you want it did you want another
Italian so you are cheap Sweden they
have 300 nice Moses mom that's Michael
like banana you might want to come in
