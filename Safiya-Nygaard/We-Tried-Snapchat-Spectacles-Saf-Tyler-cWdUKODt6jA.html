that's up in the subway sigh hello
friends and welcome to another video
today we're going to be trying to get
and use some snapchat spectacle staff I
came out with this product called
spectacle about a month
ish ago so these spectacles are
basically sunglasses that have a little
camera on one side I don't look like a
GoPro you hit a button there are chords
I think you're like 10 seconds and then
it like syncs with your snapchat and you
can just upload it to your snapchat
since then they've only been selling
them at not bought vending machines
across America the big thing is that the
snap bot dispenses until it's out for
that day and then it goes to sleep right
and so it has a very limited supply even
know where it is
if you get there fast it's a lot of
moving dynamics it's pretty tricky but
there is a semi-permanent pop-up in New
York City that was open from like what
like mid-november until New Year's Eve
yes we're in New York City visiting
Tyler sister for the holidays this is
her spot her place her pad her crib if
you will I thought that it was gonna be
like I could put them on then soft would
just have like a dog runs on because you
go which one is this I wish mine is it's
already mr. rainbow I also really like
the one that's like it's like your face
is emitting what about this already I
can't
that flower crown yes I feel like in
general I probably wouldn't have gone
for them except that I want to know what
they are like and I feel like it's also
like shrouded in mystery shot in them
you know it's like oh not just Mexico it
seems like a fun gadget and it seems
like it's going to be fun to try out but
we don't know which is why we gotta go
get up and try it let's do it we're
going to go on the train we're going to
go to the pop-up shop and we're going to
get these bad boys it's raining out now
might see today not the best day to
human subjects like jewelry in suspense
okay we can use this Martha would like
it they are really aren't you get it -
thank you and it not being bad new and
it's cold and wet outside and we're
dealing with grief yes right about there
hopefully we're just going to try to get
one care for people I don't think we
need to there could be a long line we
could be stuck outside in the rain doing
it out so we got to the store yes and it
was pouring rain it was really hard it's
kind of like the Eye of Sauron if it's
looking at you two towers what happened
gasps it's a little more one-dog lens to
bind them
I think the pouring rain helped a lot
with how quickly you could go get home
okay so we're in they had a show our
credit card and ID at the door and babe
show them your hand stamp they give us a
hand stamp
they look like spectacles to me so we
walked in and it sounds like a big
really yeah with like the ropes or the
line in the middle and then they have
screens on the side yeah playing sound
suspect and they're all rotating so kind
of demonstrate that you can wonder
watching of any particular spectacle
rotate it because it's a circular video
good you know that the video is a circle
one circle like a monocle I love it
because casing here for this thing is
like you're a dad with a lot of adorable
cute so we walked right up to the snap
pod people back with my new friend and
the snow fox make like cute little
noises
they're pretty adorable we need like a
little visitor
either through the color she's managing
a flat so you walk up you sell over a
hundred thirty bucks it's pretty pricey
it's also kind of jarring to go up to a
vending machine and put your money into
a vending machine maybe like 130 dollars
even though we already knew that we were
going to spend that money I've never
bought anything more expensive at a
vending machine than the two dollar
pop-tart commanders now reach in moaning
wow it looks like tennis ball one of the
store employees is really helpful and
she helped us set up the whole thing
right in there and then you can rename
them you just can't erase the sunglasses
emoji of a maybe it's soft bifocals okay
nailed it ended up say selecting the
country and just a few seconds it'll pop
up the cool thing about this is that I
set it up to my snapchat and my phone
but it doesn't like have an owner you
can get paired to my phone or if Tyler
wants to take it somewhere it can get
her to his phone a little button to
record it right here and then you record
out of this whole thing right there okay
ready
my taking video of you yeah hello I can
see there's a little white light and
going oh my god you can see it okay well
no he's not so secret any cozening I
can't just be like a briefer and like oh
you're a creeper the cool thing about
the spectacles is that you can film
longer than 10 seconds and so what you
do if you click it once for 10 seconds
twice for 20 seconds and 3 times for 30
seconds I think I'm thinking a 20 second
video now off is never long for 20 Oh
are you dodging bullets right now yeah
in your snap video well I don't know it
might not be a very good video OOP don't
worry it's not recording I'm just
looking at your boobs it's not recording
you've gone through a lot of lengths to
do this Tyler you're gonna probably just
ask me it was raining pretty hard and I
was nervous about taking these guys out
in the rain you recorded a little bit of
subway oh hello there new friend made me
feel uncomfortable
my hand on your leg yeah
a little bit back at Tyler sister's
apartment yeah this house was really
cute dog
not as a great use case exact because he
ran right up to us it was so easy just
to hit it and record it as you like
jumping at our case like dog dog dog
puppy hi so the next day when it wasn't
raining we went out we got some good
footage or out today
doing our filming Sanchez spectacles is
it weird that I kind of like using night
shot right now no Casey always has new
and different cameras and he's wearing
sunglasses all the time
you
the dog man who was I good
this kind of incited like strange
walking patterns in myself where like I
wanted to record a street food vendor
and so I put these on my clique for 20
seconds and I kind of just started
teasing back and forth and if I hear him
hey he was like hi another waffle you
can see me something that I noticed
after I downloaded some of the footage
was that my hair what often times come
in front of the lens slightly there's
definitely times in which it's not that
convenient flash you look kind of weird
doing it they put is covering their
whole lens in our recording yes their
sunglasses so when you want to record
something either inside or at night
you're wearing sunglasses at night I
kind of tried to get around this by
holding my glasses I think for a couple
of them my finger got in the way because
I was holding them like a camera and out
of the car it just be careful of
appearing on camera because that's where
the magic happens I was just used to
filming with my head so when I was using
it I was just sort of like you have to
control head movements very particularly
and it's just like it's just something
I'm not used to it maybe I'll get used
to it over time the other thing about
that self is that I find a lot of the
time my arm gets tired from holding a
camera or a phone yeah and there's none
of that with these bad boys no it's
really easy I also think that the
fashion of them is it to that not a
pretty cool look I think that because
they're unisex they are a little bit
more wide set yeah so it doesn't look
super buggy
it was very Pokemon Jewish yes it got us
out of the apartment you're walking
around it was a blast to use I think a
good way to kind of figure out how
important is is like comparing it kind
of like a drone and you roll it is super
cool you don't really need one you can
watch other people use it if someone is
using they can like hand you the
controller you can slide around a little
bit so do I have to crash it I think if
you have a close friend or a family
member who's really into tech products
gadgets or snapchat
they might really love this I'm not
going to say you need these things
yeah but we did have a really good time
I think there are definitely situations
in which this would actually be more
useful and snapchatting on your phone
it's for hiking or looking you're like
riding a bike yeah it's like when it
really is hard for you to take out your
phone like being a parent if your kids
are running around let your nautical
corral them and stuff like in de Turing
I want to get this moment it'll be
easier for you to see what have your
sunglasses on more like daytime
summertime activities with the fam with
the dog with you know yeah that kind of
stuff okay guys thank you so much for
