friends and welcome to another video
this week I'm going to be trying out
another questionable fashion item and
this time they are the completely
see-through jeans so Topshop created the
clear Nieman jeans which I have
previously tried out and I think that
they were so pleased by the controversy
that those jeans caused that they took
it a step further now I feel like I've
used my fair share of alarmist language
around these clothing items so I'm not
going to call these jeans if we can even
call them jeans the ugliest jeans in the
world but I do have to ask what's the
hop are those Topshop now sells clear
plastic jeans and no one knows what to
wear them with clear plastic jeans and
the end of pants someone please explain
the reasoning behind these clear pants
what is the reasoning behind the clear
pants because I'm going to be honest I
don't know exactly why any person who's
not walking a runway or perhaps going
fly-fishing would need these clear pants
shall I bring them out without further
ado be clear if you can even call them
jeans jeans my initial thought is that
this doesn't feel great oh my god I'm
also I'm very mad about this tag this
large tag inside don't you know that
your pants are clear you can't just put
a tag in here another first impression
is that it doesn't look very long which
is probably good because hopefully I'll
get some ankle breathing but you know
what I want to know why I genuinely want
to know why these pants exist let's
rhyme on
no no no seriously can go out in this
pace I mean I like old booty shorts all
right
so it's not like NSFW but my sides are
very exposed look at how do I sound it's
loud I'm gonna be honest I'm completely
speechless actually I try to walk around
with these guys on my life or devices
are they don't feel as bad as I thought
they would I'm honestly think though
that I'm probably gonna have to take
breaks in the middle today just because
like imagine if I get really sweaty I
guess it airs well I mean as we were
talking about how my life would like
ground turkey in a produce bag last time
oh oh we didn't know what's coming are
they stuck to your leg just raise your
hand if you've ever felt personally
victimized by Topshop the sound of me
walking down this hallway right now is
obscene this is not a good noise so
usually on the first day I like to take
it a little bit easy but I also wanted
to style it how Topshop filed it and
they went full bare leg and this is a
lot of leg like my dams are really out
about right now so I thought a good
introductory place to go would be the
mall that we usually go to I don't know
that I was right people are walking by
and a varying attention if you look over
your shoulder there are people looking
the funny thing is I feel so covered
because like they're so definitely on my
legs like I can feel them but like my
legs are out like I am kind of vacant I
also was making a lot of noise
what I didn't think about was that the
noise would alert passerby to something
happening and people would then look and
then see my bear fight well played
chopped up well played I did get some
very vocal positive responses when I was
in line a girl walked by and said whoa
please pants and I was like what she's
been so enthusiastic and I was like no
I'm enthusiastic too but then I did also
get some confused two negative responses
probably 30 seconds after I was so
excited you all know in the walk by me
it look at me when we've been out for a
couple of hours in my clear pants I kind
of reached the end of my rope not
emotionally my actual end of the rope is
because of the chasing that's begun just
my very upper thighs started to rub
against the plastic and each other
diaper rash oh thanks a little bit of
diaper rash maybe with some leggings
underneath it'll be better but right now
I just like I got a couple hours and
then the chasing begins and then I got
it just forgot the emergency pants I
should have brought the emergency mails
so the next day I went for a nighttime
outfit Tyler and I went on a little date
to get some boba I put some fishnets
underneath the pants which I think kind
of works - the fact that the fishnet
went all the way into my booth all the
lights of this intersection of
reflective your pit that's why they're
kind of flattering is because like they
do reflect like a ton of light you can't
even get a good look at the leg now are
you cold
not really I'm feeling kind of insulated
the only problem is that they're a
little like
weddy I did notice a small amount of fog
around the crotch oh my god that's
inappropriate we also did a spill test
in which we spilled a small amount of my
boba on to my legs just to make sure
that the one value proposition of these
pants is in fact true oh did you get oh
it looks pretty good it's running right
off hey I'm a messy eater this like
actually this could be legit it's cold I
can feel it we also stopped by the
grocery store and I hung out with my
brother in the sausages sausage or legs
spot the difference okay you guys
crusty hates these pants are so loud
these pants have made my cat hate me
the next day we just had errands to run
and I wanted to try on a more like
casual look okay Tyler what did you just
say I I think it is casual it kind of
works is there kind of cool I'm not
going to go all in in that it's
definitely working today but I do feel
like wearing pants under these pants is
a pretty good call
we went to Costco we got some lunch my
favorite part now that I realize is that
see my hands just grow up in myself it's
not a big deal I tried another spill
test this time with mustard check it out
yeah in the matter
I just forgot me and often that was
great very satisfying actually with
leggings under the clear jeans at least
in this situation I was pretty
comfortable I wasn't getting too many
reactions except for a couple of
reaction from middle-aged women who both
really complimented the pants
the woman was at the entrance of Costco
kind of like checking your cards when
you walk in stops me and said that my
pants really remind her of the sixties
and seventies and when I told her that
people thought these pants were ugly she
was like what they're so cool so when
she mentioned the sixties in the 70s I
wanted to do some research into wear
clear plastic clothing has appeared in
fashion history before in the 1960s
there was a space-age fashion trend that
included wearing plastic clothes the
trend reflected an interest in space
exploration which was kind of a hot
topic because of the space race between
the USA and the USSR space travel and
visions of the future were everywhere in
the 60s from newspapers to runways to TV
screens and movie theatres though these
clothes were maybe not worn as everyday
attire some designers were making
clothes out of materials used by
astronauts like vinyl plastic and velcro
these outfits were kind of like
projections of what people believed
future clothes would look like it seemed
like everyone was pretty sure we'd be
wearing plastic by now another instance
I found of literal clear plastic pants
being worn was in 1994 by Park Jinyoung
or JYP a Korean pop star it's not clear
exactly where he got the inspiration for
the pants but he said that he wore them
as a rebellious statement and he was
actually banned from broadcasting for
awhile after wearing them JYP and his
plastic pants have had a reemergence
recently
so maybe Topshop got the inspiration for
the plastic pants from him okay so back
to my little pocket pick you feel at
home I found my people
we have groceries to get what's in the
car day for after the success of the
black leggings under the plastic pants I
decided to go for some camo leggings
that I purchased earlier in the week
they sent you the first
like colors or patterns under the clear
jeans and it is kind of fun I think it's
fun that you can like get a window into
the pattern my only issue was that my
leggings were very high waisted and the
pants were kind of falling down so I
kept trying to hike them up but besides
that I was having a good pot I feel like
the camo and the plastic kind of
complemented each other like I am not
only in caelo I'm also under an
encircling Club and we actually just
walked by a guy who looked at my pants
and said oh my god what I like the camo
pants though I'm standing by them stay
for with also the day that we flew to
Orlando for playlist live I actually had
ordered these pants a while ago but I
wanted to wait to wear the pants for
this week so I could bring them to you
guys at playlist I am NOT going to be
wearing these on the plane I'm sorry
guys I couldn't do it a five-hour flight
and clear jeans is just not in the cards
it wouldn't have been a good look and by
luck I mean sound so outfit 5 was the
first day of playlist and I had a Q&amp;amp;A
that day I was very excited to hear what
you guys had to say about the plastic
pants I hope it's not too like a risque
I do have shorts and fishnet tights on
but you know we'll see we're on the way
to the QA and I just you can hear the
Cullens by the time we get to the panel
no one going to be there yeah they're
like is that a problem
here while you guys were very
complimentary of the plastic pants you
guys were very nice about them actually
think there is something aesthetically
cool about them when you've got
something going on in the week okay so
we just finish our QA and a lot of you
guys seem to like the pants in a certain
way
my friends Natalie and Dennis from
Natalie's outlet and Dennis's outlet
we're also very nice about them
I know to be one
crazy and I like
Tyler and I are going to download this
like decibel measuring app and we're
going to see how loud these things are I
don't know precise it is it's an app but
it should work I want to turn the
microphone near your pants let's see now
oh my god oh yeah I broke 80 do you see
that I go full go for broke 80 decibels
so glad pants so up until that point I
hadn't washed the pants so I thought
they're plastic might as well try and
just walk into the pool with the screens
on I haven't looked at the tag I haven't
looked at the care instructions I'm
angry at the tag they kind of work in
the bathing suit pool party you don't
want to touch anyone else's leg anything
it's actually perfect for water park
they definitely felt very weird in the
water it felt like a plastic bag kind of
like dragging me back
I feel like selling it you're like trash
island funny thing is now that I'm in
the water like no one else around he can
really tell unless they saw me walk in
and I'm just wearing clear caesium I'm
not going to stay out here long enough
any of the effect of cam line you know
what would help the saw happen so I was
getting paid
han line around the tag did you just go
in that you found that in the pool and
there's someone sandwich bag so outfit
six was me in my bathing suit and my
soggy plastic pants we'll see if this
actually cleans the pants I mean they
definitely not have been rinsed but I
got a lot of compliments on the pants
around the pool so maybe they kind of go
with a swimsuit line even though they're
not really for swimming
speaking of the tag no I did not cut the
tag out just in protest of the fact that
there exists a tag on these pants and
that honestly is the crime that Topshop
should be charged with it's putting a
tag in plastic pants so outfit seven so
the final outfit I feel like in the last
couple of videos I've kind of been like
building up the ugly items together I
actually wanted to take it in the
opposite direction and try and like make
it as wearable as possible on the way to
our meetups
I try to go for the space teen
aesthetics back to the Xenon references
of course I'm excited I'm excited to
meet a lot of you guys but I'm also
apologetic in advance if I ruin any
photo I think generally you guys like
them I actually do think that outfit
seven is my favorite of all the outfits
I think something about the top and the
bottom being kind of space-age II and
see-through worked together the meetup
went pretty smoothly the only hiccup was
when Natalie and Dennis noticed that I
had some but condensation
you guys may be partying out here I have
it I think it's from butt sweat even
though it's pretty comfortable inside
the pants of leggings it can get a
little warm so we're gonna go with that
wow that's awkward because of the puck
sweat I kind of like retired the pants
until nightfall endure out so I stayed
inside for most of the day the Sun is
actually going down right now
now we're going to take my plastic pants
and go to Universal hopefully the pants
have a good time the pants at Universal
we're actually not super uncomfortable
like I was able to like fits places with
just a little bit of hotness around my
thighs and knees and I was actually
feeling pretty limber
that was effective I was kind of you
know shuffling around having a good time
there was a party afterwards at which my
legs got super condensation me because I
was dancing a lot feel like dancing
amongst other people really brought on
the condensation but just wandering
around Universal was like pretty okay
overall I think I've had a change of
heart about these pants I think when
you're wearing them with bare legs
underneath they're just too
uncomfortable to really be worth it
well when you've got types or leggings
or fishnets or whatever underneath it's
kind of a cool effect it looks like
you've got like static electricity
around your legs or you know you are an
astronaut like you it is a kind of
space-age look I definitely think
there's a practicality issue with these
pants even with stuff underneath them
they don't breathe very well so you do
get condensation now and again and
that's definitely something to think
about especially for planning on wearing
them all day long the chasing in the
condensation is bad but manageable the
noise is unavoidable it attracts a lot
of attention you can hear Sofia coming
down the hallway these are like
borderline solid walls these pants
definitely have flaws but there is
something cool about them that I do
enjoy I also really love that I got to
bring them to playlist and share them
with you guys there I think that you
guys enjoyed it I hope a little bit oh
and one more thing I don't think they're
jeans I think they're just clear pants
unless I start calling them clear pants
we don't think they aren't pants but
they're not jeans they're not denim so
