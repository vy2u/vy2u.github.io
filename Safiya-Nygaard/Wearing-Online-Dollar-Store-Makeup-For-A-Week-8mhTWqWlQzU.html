video this week I'm gonna be wearing a
full face of online dollar store makeup
so I've heard about this website shop
Missa which is an online makeup store
where everything costs one dollar from
primer to foundation to eyeliner it's
all one dollar now they say that the
reason that their costs are so low is
because they have direct relationships
with manufacturers but whenever I see
super low cost anything combined with
the fact that it's online my spidey
senses tingle now I've tried dollar
store makeup pretty recently from the
Japanese dollar store dye so and I was
pleasantly surprised by how much of the
stuff ended up looking pretty good but
the lingering question that I had and
many of you had as well is how well this
very low cost makeup would perform over
the course of the day or even let's say
a week so I thought why not do both try
out online dollar store makeup for week
we'll see how long it lasts and also how
long my skin lasts all right let's start
shopping it looks like it actually might
not be shocked Missa it might be shop
miss a but I don't I think I think I
like shop Missa better I'm sorry Tyler
do the song yet see wouldn't work a shot
miss a I'm gonna try and replace
everything in my everyday makeup routine
so like complexion cheek eye and lip
products I think let's start with the
face products so I'm gonna click on face
and body and go down to the concealer
looks like we've got a few different
things clean color
santé oh I remember that brand from
Daiso it looks like this brand aoa might
be like their in-house brand and they
have a lot of different colors of this
wonder cover concealer let me click on
this one classic ivory not to be like
grammar police but they did misspell
porcelain as fossil Aine so shop Missa
just letting you know classic ivory
looks a little bit too pink for me but
beige and light I
both seem like colors that would work
let's open up light to ivory which is
the one I want interesting there is a
different customer review star even
though it's like the same product or
just in a different color
someone says yellow and too dark
Danielle says it's great though I'm
gonna go with Danielle on this one and
hope that Danielle is right so I'm gonna
add this one to the cart and also add
beige to the cart they are both only one
dollar and I feel like you know getting
two will just hopefully ensure that one
of them will match I'm also going to
grab this color corrector in peach for
my under eye bags so let's grab a
foundation - while we're at it these
look kind of exciting looks like
anything close to my color is already
sold out so never mind how about this
thing oh just kidding those seem to be
sold out - it is available in medium
bisque but based on the swatches I'm not
sure that would work so I was like clam
chowder so let's take a look at these
ones down here LA Colors foundation it's
got three and a half stars based on 13
reviews a philia says it's amazing part
but Talia Brenda and Alison do not like
it let's just give it a shot let's go
with this one
creamy beige and then I'm also gonna get
natural as well on the plus side these
are both in stock but then again on the
con side maybe the things that people
like are sold out and this is kind of
what's left behind so why don't we look
for some other face stuff I would say
that like loose setting powder is
something that's like pretty vital to my
routine because I'm like an oily combo
gal so I really just I bake it all down
wait is this it it doesn't look like
they have any loose setting powder at
all which is sad how about this thing
clean ista pressed powder I think that
people are using this as like a literal
foundation powder but it's powder and we
need to like get something to set it
down so I think we should maybe just go
with this let's see about some contour
interesting it says that it's on sale
for one dollar but originally was listed
as $39 I'm not sure I buy that but I may
buy this
79 reviews and four stars that's pretty
promising actually
I'm gonna add this to my cart and call
that our contour product I'm also gonna
pick up a bronzer while I'm at it
alright so let's move on to the eyes
currently my liquid eyeliner is like the
only product that I'm kind of like Holy
Grail ish about so we'll see how this
eyeliner stacks up so I'm looking
specifically for like a black matte
liquid eyeliner it's hard to tell if
this right here is like a brush or just
a stick because the liquid eyeliner that
I used from Daiso ended up like looking
pretty good but it did have kind of like
a bit of a sharp stick at the end of
quill
I mean I feel like for this we just kind
of have to pick one and go with it
this one looks as nice as any of them
and it seems to have pretty good reviews
especially from Megan so Megan lead me
to the light I'm gonna add this to the
cart and I'm also gonna grab this
mascara which Sariah seems to like she
says it's average like any other mascara
that sounds like a winner so let's do I
primer next just to help out the
eyeliner you know just stay where it's
supposed to be looks like they only have
one listing for an eye primer they've
got two options matte and shiny
I feel like usually I go from matte so
let's do matte and it's sold out so
never mind let's go for frost then I
guess that's fine alright so let's look
for some eyebrow pencils that's usually
what I use one of the the easier ones
like the beginner ones where you can
kind of just go like ramp ramp looks
like we've got some gels some powders
some stencils and we've got a product
called the Sante eyebrow sword that
sounds like something I want so I'm just
gonna get black brown and black kind of
like a mix them together I feel like
that makes sense the fact that it's
called a sword is honestly enough for me
to add that to the cart right now so I
guess actually all we have left right
now is lips so I want to test out like a
liquid lipstick feel like you know one
dollar lipsticks are just it's a danger
zone for me this looks like a nice color
yeah look it's kind of like a purple
pink nude like a little everyday but
like a little exciting at the same time
oh and people seem to really like this
one Christina says very very good with
an extra oh so it's good so let's get
this
try it out okay so I think that that is
a full face of makeup products honestly
from what I've seen from the swatches
online and the reviews I'm excited for
some of these products a couple of them
had more mixed reviews but I feel like
we're gonna find some gems I've got a
good feeling about it alright so here
are all of my $1 makeup items these are
my own brushes but the rest of the stuff
is my new everyday makeup routine for
the next week so what I usually do to
start off is eyebrows so let's take my
eyebrow swords which are sadly not
called eyebrow swords on the actual
packaging on one side we've got a
spoolie and on the other side we've got
the kind of like triangular pencil all
right so I'm gonna dive right in
pull it up brush down and then let's see
how the sword is doing that looks pretty
good yeah I mean it looks maybe like a
little bit almost like a mixture of a
gel and a pencil like it feels really
soft
that's an eyebrow I think what do you
think I mean you had an eyebrow before
but yeah to be honest I can never tell
with eyebrows this is the one that I did
in black and this one's in black brown
on camera you can't really see a
difference so I guess I could go with
either but I do actually think that the
black one in person kind of matches me a
little bit more but overall definitely a
usable eyebrow pencil or sword I want an
eyebrow sword shield and jousting stick
please
so next I'm gonna try the eye primer
it's one of those things like I feel
like I wouldn't necessarily want my
eyelids to be shimmery every single day
of my life but it looks cute alright so
now I'm gonna move on to the complexion
products let's open this up and just go
in the bags
pack your bags let's let's wake up the
face okay that looks about the right
color it's a little greasy almost like a
Ben Nye stage makeup but I feel like the
coverage is pretty good I mean the
interesting thing is like it's kind of
almost getting more orange and like more
spread out and more I touch it with my
finger so over the course of the week I
feel like I'm just gonna use this one
well sparingly
alright so let's get another concealer
going so this one is light ivory let's
see what beige looks like they look
pretty similar to be honest I think that
light ivory is probably going to be the
better Matt
this feels also like a little bit on the
greasy side but it seems a little less
like crazy pigmented like I feel like
the peach was just like well I'm here it
is not the easiest easiest to blend out
but it's definitely like workable all
right so that's concealer so next I
think we're gonna tackle foundation
which I also have two of oh oh also I've
already put primer on so don't worry
this is creamy beige and this one's
natural I think that creamy beige looks
a little bit closer to the concealer
color so I think let's go with creamy
beige for now but I feel like we did
substitute them both in it smells a lot
like Coppertone sunscreen and I seem to
be going through it pretty fast it
doesn't look nice actually though on the
face but it seems to kind of um be
pretty watery but for a dollar I feel
like we can definitely make it work
alright so I think that that is gonna
conclude my foundation portion I think
maybe I'm a little bit
oranjee compared to my double chin but I
think that the concealer is kind of
skewing it that way and also like the PG
color corrector which kind of just
migrated across the face alright so next
I'm gonna set everything down with our
pressed powder I am a little bit shiny
right now so hopefully this will help me
I mean I'm not sure exactly what to say
because like it seems like fine powder
foundation I'm just worried about it as
setting powder all right so let's do
contour next okay so my contour kit
looks pretty legit I feel like from the
looks of it I'll probably be using like
this one on the bottom right it's gonna
get some on there suck in like a fish
and go to town it's a little bit red
maybe I should try this cooler toned
color yeah I think that one's gonna be
better so we're gonna use the one in the
middle actually for the rest of the week
before I blend that in I'm gonna also
add my Sun glow shimmer bronzer I was
kind of nice
definitely shimmery and then blend it in
with a little bit more of that pressed
powder foundation so we've got eyeliner
and mascara and lipstick left so I'm
gonna go into my eyeliner it looks a bit
like the quill I was describing it seems
to be kind of like more of a stick than
a brush it almost feels like rubbery so
it doesn't feel as sharp as the one I
tried from the dyso video oh okay let me
dip back in there we go I would say that
from my first impressions it seems like
if I
the product on my I like it looks pretty
good actually but if I'm trying to draw
with the tip it's actually hard to get
product off it's actually a lot easier
to get product off the sides of the tip
so now that I finished off my second eye
for eyeliner I'm just gonna put my
mascara on really quick
they say comb for longer lashes but I
don't really understand how you're
supposed to comb but first I'm just
gonna use the like normal brush on my
lashes I think that's mascara actually
it's pretty nice you know it seems to be
like coating my lashes with some black
stuff so that's always good oh hey that
can't be right
that looks cute oh oh okay you're just
pushing your eyelid around yeah kind of
it feels this thing seems to have made
like a couple of my eyelashes just stick
straight up in the air but I like the
mascara all right so the last thing that
we have to do is lips mmm-hmm
it definitely looks like I'm gonna be
needing to do a couple of coats to like
get it to be a full opaque lip color but
I do like how it feels also it looks
like the butthole coverage it's pretty
good and that's always a priority for me
all right so I think with the completion
of the lipstick this is our finished
shop miss a makeup look I'm gonna be
wearing this makeup look all day and
then also for the rest of the week so
I'm gonna check back in in a couple of
hours alright I'm back I've just been
sitting on the other room editing and I
think that I have reached some grease
levels I'm Sandra Dee the biggest issue
right off the bat was the powder
situation everything else seems to be
okay though so I think that the problem
starts and probably stops with the fact
that I tried to use that pressed powder
foundation as setting powder I'm getting
close to the time where I would usually
take my makeup off and I think I've like
Reap powdered my face so many times that
like I have just like a layer of powder
on it so after that first day I decided
to introduce a true setting powder just
to kind of like give everything a shot
okay so
wearing my makeup for a couple of hours
already and I think it's definitely
working better what some setting powder
on and I think that everything is
seeming to be a little more Sachin
looking rather than like straight up
went over the course of the week I
actually started eliminating the color
corrector and the concealer from my
routine almost entirely just because
they seem to be pretty oil-based and did
really like to stay on my skin very well
these adjustments definitely helped keep
the oil more in check and later in the
week we tested it out a bit with some
spicy curry sweats okay
so we just finished dinner that was a
little spicier than necessary but I
think that overall like my makeup is
still chilling I will say however my
nose is a runnin besides the liquid
complexion products I did have a couple
of products that I really liked the big
winner of this week was the eyebrow
pencil it's actually pretty similar to
the one I use currently which is this
one I definitely go through the formula
a little bit faster because it's kind of
like softer but in application they're
pretty similar and this one's like 20
times cheaper so I'm very pleased with
this a couple of other things I actually
really liked included the eyeliner and
the lipstick for the eyeliner once you
get it on your face it really doesn't
come off or fade it almost like turns
into like a little layer in itself the
only thing I don't like about it is that
you have to kind of dip the tip into the
liquid a few times to really get enough
for the whole wing but once you get it
on it's good the lipstick was also
pretty good it does dry a little wrinkly
but it's pretty comfortable and it seems
to be a good dupe for a couple of my
favorite lipsticks in this lighting they
don't seem to be like perfect color
dupes also I really messed up that
swatch but they are in that same color
family and I would say that this
lipstick is not decidedly worse than
those you know it just takes a couple
layers and I feel like I'm pretty much
good to go for most of the day don't see
anything
stayin free it's not bulletproof
it does come off a little bit with
eating but you can just put it right
back on just layer it and it'll be fine
so besides how the makeup was the other
big test for this week was how my skin
would do most of my skin issues have
been like while I'm wearing the makeup
how much oil I've been producing but in
terms of breakouts I think that we're
doing pretty okay maybe I have like one
people kind of over here that's forming
like something like too bad or
catastrophic overall I don't think I
would recommend the complexion products
like the concealer or the foundation
that said I did only try out one type of
concealer and one type of foundation so
if you could do a little more trial and
error and maybe head up the site when
things weren't as sold out as when I
bought stuff you might be able to find
something that works I would say that
the contour kit the bronzer and the
eyeshadow primer were kind of in the
middle oh and the mascara it's fine I
think it's mostly just cute the products
that I definitely would recommend though
are the eyebrow pencil the eyeliner and
the lipstick all in all I think I would
buy from shop Missa again I probably
won't go for any more face products but
I am interested to see what other
lipsticks they have because I did see
some other colors on their website and
this was one doll and it had pretty good
butt hole coverage and that's priceless
