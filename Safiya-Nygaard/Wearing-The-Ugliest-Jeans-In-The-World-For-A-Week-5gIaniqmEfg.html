German which means that this has gone
international hello friends and welcome
to another video I recently made a video
where I wore what some people thought
were the ugliest shoes in the world ever
made for me and soon after I released
that video these pants
exploded on the internet they're from
Topshop they cost $95 and they are
called the clear knee mom Jean some
people really love them a lot of people
really hate them top shops clear panel
Mon jeans might be the worst of all time
look at these clear knee mom jeans from
Topshop and tell me that God is instead
mom jeans with plastic needs a sign of
the end time I don't think that these
jeans are single handedly heralding the
apocalypse I think that Topshop was just
like mom jeans are a trend clear
material is a trend and also people like
ripped jeans clear material mom jeans
ripped knees all together you get
clearing emojis and so of course I have
to get them and now without further ado
the infamous clear and needy mom Jean oh
man here they are I'm pretty sure I'll
get roasted again I'm sure I'll get some
funny looks but I think that we can
definitely survive a week in the worst
jeans in the world okay look let's try
any bad ways on how do they look
oh my god I don't know it looks like
your legs are saran-wrapped one thing
that I'm noticing is that I'm going to
shave my legs maybe I can just shave
this window right here the rest of it
like the mom Jean itself with the denim
330 I think that you know it's pretty
cropped as you can see they only come in
one length by just keep moving your I
doesn't know where to stop do what do
you think of them people they kind of
have a like ground turkey look to them
in that like there's the meat and then
there's the plastics I do feel
a little cool you feel cool yeah a
little bit like I feel it's a very
confusing feelings moving about this she
loses and the shoes are very comfortable
these are like so many elements put
together will we be able to find you for
it okay so it is same one of wearing
ugliest jeans in the world
day one I wanted to keep it kind of
casual just because I was testing the
waters I haven't really gotten any weird
looks I haven't really gotten any
comments no one said anything to me or
at least my face something that I didn't
think about was the fact that the knees
are exposed to the Sun and it's quite a
sunny day today so I'm getting kind of
worried that I'm about to get really
strange tan line and I shaved my leg so
you couldn't see the hairs through the
jean windows and then I moisturize my
legs after shaving them which is what I
usually do and it's creating some
moisture in the pant the plastic is
definitely sticking to my thighs so I
actually just got complimented on my
jeans by the cashier at a coffee place
he couldn't be in the vlog because he
was at work you know the only feedback
I've gotten today has been one positive
comment so today is day two of me
wearing these jeans I chose the top that
says stay weird because it just fell
appropriate it is so great yeah that's
about right there's a boulder element to
these and with the ugliest shoes these
shoes are kind of like Oh or those past
photos orthopedic are you okay and we
were like you chose back I did not
always drive my knees today just trying
to get a smoother situation going even
without the moisturiser they were still
sticking to my leg okay looks like your
knees are stuck like a foot in a bag
they're like I wouldn't they did it was
teeny but it was definitely a little bit
wet we just got out of the car and it's
really sticking I was sweating I think
in the car so that the shimmy you need
to do to release me there Jimmy to Train
get the plastic off I don't know whether
we're going to use or but they're not
the best because they're like it right
here what I'm sitting it's like they
don't look comfortable isn't it
they're okay they they ride up so high
and goes like at your butt is sitting in
an unnatural location in your jeans I
don't know what my motherhood
so we're home now I finally figured out
what I think soft jeans look like Tyler
has been staring at my knee oh it's like
it's like a hot dog in a plastic bag I
don't think they're as atrocious
fashionably as people think they are
you're just like the feeling of the
plastic but I'm just like why so it's
day three and it's been raining all day
long so I haven't been able to go out in
my gene I'm going to go meet up with my
friend Dan because I haven't seen him in
a while and we'll see what he thinks we
were going to like a bar or restaurant
type thing so I decided to try and take
my jeans out for a nice time spin this
is my nighttime style I felt this like
top cut out we kind of balance out the
bottom cut out it is kind of raining out
so I'm gonna have to be like like not
trying to slip and die yeah you don't
want to die in those jeans you think
that would make it into your obituaries
that is such a literal take on the
expression you wouldn't catch me dead in
back Dan notice the jeans right away I
am out of like what you liked our turkey
like I do not understand okay what do
you think of the whole my whole outfit
though it's like my hair is accessible
connected students that don't make 70
healthy
not right but it's happening if you cut
the bottom no that's how they come I got
a ticket mr. Johan
so they four rolls around and I'm
thinking I haven't gotten enough
feedback on these jeans mostly just been
Tyler and the guy at the coffee shop and
so I'm thinking it's time to ask you
guys what you think and by asking you
guys I mean another installment of me
posting on Instagram without mentioning
the jeans and seeing what you say when I
wore the teba uggs I was feeling pretty
good about them until this point then I
instagrammed and you guys really didn't
hold back so I'm excited to see what you
guys think but I'm also a little bit
nervous because I think I've been living
in a little bit of a bubble I think a
lot of you guys were on to me there were
a lot of comments knowing exactly what I
was up to and you guys were right
Carly comments they are mixed the thing
about these jeans is that they elicit a
strong reaction like a lot of comments
immediately good or bad the jeans oh my
god they're actually kinda cute those
are disgusting it looks like you
stitched a plastic sandwich bag to denim
you fiend but I think there is a dude on
you guys who are like I don't know how I
feel but I'm feeling something I feel
like your knees need something if only
they made underwear for knees I like
these jeans in a weird alien abduction
II way those jeans are the equivalent to
someone trying to pull off a mullet in
2017 but strangely this look makes me
want to like mullet my feelings can be
only expressed with the phrase I'm
almost loving it I think the general
consensus is that they're just
mystifying they're just confusing
they're like the clothing item version
of a Jaden Smith tweet how can mirrors
be real if our eyes aren't real day five
I decided to try and fix my little niece
ticking situation I don't think they're
tight enough at the bottom to truly fog
up but you can definitely get some
droplets of sweat going on the actual
window I do remember this one interview
where Brittany
dear said when she was wearing her vinyl
red oops I did it again jumpsuits they
would baby powder her into it so she
could get in and out of it so I'm going
to CBS right now to see if I can find
some baby powder miscellaneous Cal
compounder type thing to try and just
you know powder might need a bit
cornstarch baby powder cause that that's
some kind of fun this is going to be
really visible
oh no no no all right so a change of
plans so we're just going to have to do
it like really mildly like a really
small amount and just put it on the
knees okay so I've got the jeans on can
you see the baby powder you can't see it
on the outside I don't think it
definitely doesn't feel it City this
might be a good solution I'm just going
to stick this corn starch with my bag
and go about my day that sound like a
terrible move the cornstarch baby powder
was really helpful for like 45 minutes
to an hour and then Nate wore away the
only problem is that it's hard to get in
there you can't really just like
casually re-up your baby powder you kind
of like go to the bathroom d-pants bring
your baby powder with you and then like
rub your knees I think I'm going to keep
doing it so I had a meeting today and I
wore my ugly jeans I met a lot of new
people and nobody said anything about
the jeans the only bad part about today
is that I've had to spit a lot and
sitting in these things aren't the most
comfortable because like you could kind
of get sweaty and stuck to the plastic
and the plastic like stretches over your
knees I tried to fit you powder trick
again but once again after about like 45
minutes to an hour it kind of went away
so my knees are just chilling in honor
of today being the last day and I'm
going to be wearing these jeans
continuously I wore my ugly pants with
my ugly shoes the Teva ugh when I
thought of these I didn't know what to
wear on top and what I decided for the
cold shoulder top because what are these
two things have in common
unnecessary cut up the toes are out so
yeah I didn't shave my toes and then the
knees are out I did shave my needs
please pants the needs so what else I'm
like all to the shoulder out now I'm of
a cold shoulder top this is
me saying that exposing your shoulders
is weird in any way but itself like
right on these I call it the Swiss
cheese look I think that that was my
destiny that day was to bring together
all of these items and just have my head
shoulders knees and toes exposed I
thought I was really flaunting these
controversial clothing pieces I
definitely noticed a couple of people
maybe like glance and look away but I
didn't really notice anyone giving me
any long weird stares
it's like you're walking around in Elvis
suit it's like I'm walking around
invisibility cloak it's kind of like you
know we're just going to ignore
everything that happened over that's why
I wonder if people just had given up on
me altogether like they were like
whatever she's doing over there just let
her do it and don't talk I just like
really does your G's Justin oh look some
rotten baby powder here for $1 was it
around around wearing these jeans only
one person who I didn't know in real
life talk to me about them I think that
people just kind of either assume you're
going for something and they just sort
of like let it be or maybe people just
don't naturally look at your knees so
they don't even really notice that
you're wearing these strange new windows
for all the internet hysteria they
didn't seem like that big of a deal in
real life I think when I saw them online
they seemed like such a centerpiece but
I think you really can wear them with
other pieces that make them seem kind of
normal-ish after wearing these things
for a week I actually don't mind the
style of them I thought it was fun when
I wore them in like an evening situation
I really liked wearing them with heels I
really liked wearing them with kind of
crop top or body suits even though the
knee windows are impractical and cause
you to shave which I don't like I don't
mind the knee window by far the worst
part of these pants is when you're
sitting down in a car or at a restaurant
or in a meeting and the plastic is
stretched over your knees taut and
that's really when the sweat happens I
think the best use case for these jeans
was standing and taking a picture I
definitely think the price is a little
bit questionable I know that there's at
least one youtuber who've done a DIY
version of these so I'll link that in
the description
can blow I think that one of the big
reasons to wear these pants right now
are the fact that a lot of people have
opinions about these pants and they're
like a really trendy item but when you
really consider the pin they're just
pants with knee windows in them and
they're not that terrible looking but
they're not that comfortable to wear I
think that the ugly shoes have some
utility and that they were really
comfortable and they were really warm
and these are just slightly more
impractical pants you also may be buying
a lot of baby powder along with them
unless you are an actual mom volume on
jeans in which case you may already own
the baby powder thank you guys so much
