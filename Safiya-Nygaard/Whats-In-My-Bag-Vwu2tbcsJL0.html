video today I'm going to be doing a
what's in my bag video which I'm very
excited to do some of you guys requested
it I also watch a lot of other people's
what's in my bag videos one of the main
reasons that I enjoy this type of video
is that I like to see what type of
strange crap we all have at the bottom
of our purses this is the perfect time
to do it because my bag is quite
literally falling apart at the scene
there are receipts everywhere I kind of
got to go through it anyway we'll do it
together it'll be great so I think we
should just dive right in let's see
what's in my bag please don't judge me
too much I haven't cleaned it out at all
it's just it's fresh off the arm here it
is this is my hand bag that I use on
those days when I say it's literally
falling apart I mean that this is this
can you guys see that this strap is
hanging by a few thread I wouldn't see a
single thread but it's no more than four
threads now this bag is from Topshop I
use it almost every day I got into like
July of last year it's kind of like a
fake suede but it has a nice feel to it
one of the reasons I got it was because
I wanted to get a bag that was plain
that I could put like enamel pins
through and I bought this with that
purpose in mind and then as soon as I
try to actually put an enamel pin
through it I realized that to get it
through I would have to really puncture
the hole I should have probably gotten
like a canvas bag if I wanted just to
easily be able to like put pins in and
out wherever I wanted so I just decided
to leave a plain let's get into it let's
open this bad boy up let's see what I
have in my Mary Poppins purse
oh my lord it is a this is my wallet it
is gold and silver and it's marked by
Marc Jacobs this was a graduation
present from my aunt when I graduated
college inside of here I'm going to open
it like this it's a little book I have
just like my you know debit cards credit
cards Costco card can't live without
that Costco card man Wow - five dollar
bill damn
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 dollars that's $1
off my lucky number my lucky number is
16 I've got a BD go buy one get one free
oh my gosh oh babe before the 31st ooh I
also have one of these things Starbucks
you should give these to you like if
they did your order wrong they would be
like oh just here have this and like you
can show it at a Starbucks when you get
a drink for free I had two of these and
I used the last one a couple of months
ago and I went up to the cashier I was
like also this and they were like we
haven't given those out eight years but
fine but this doesn't work anymore so
I'm just waiting for you know the day to
come when I try and present this and
it's like that was issues five years ago
you're crazy
so that's my wallet let's see what
receipts I had in here shop house
Southeast Asian kitchen Phoebe go and BB
go again
nailing it all the receipts will just
sit next to right here
in a pile looks like a straw wrapper ooh
so this thing and I have a few of these
this is just one of them Wow I really
need to reevaluate the way that I
organize my curve this is a my charge
portable iPhone charger it's like a
little stick you can charge this in your
computer or on your normal iPhone
charger it's just kind of like a little
USB at the tail and it'll still up to a
full iPhone charge and then you just
carry your firewire with you and you can
you know recharge your phone anything in
this side pocket nope this handbag
doesn't offer a loss in the way of
pockets or like internal organization
there is one pocket though and I have
chosen not to put anything inside so
everything is just in the main cabin
let's take this out this is my vlogging
camera that I just got and very excited
about it this is the canon powershot g7x
mark - a lot of youtubers are really
look up to use this camera I actually
had it standing on this little Manfrotto
like mini tripod the mini tripod
actually useful to have it stand up by
itself really quick but the main reason
I have it on this is so I can hold it
easily this little thing on top is
actually something that I saw in
zoella what's in my bag video marinara
marinara and Ariana but basically it's
this little thing called a micro mug I
love the name it's so vaguely sexual or
blatantly effectual basically it's just
like a little like wind diffuser for the
microphone first looked really cute and
close to the camera mine you can really
see the velcro here so I don't know I
don't know what you did or about what I
did how you doing this is something that
should probably be in a better case
let's do it okay so far so this is a the
gun that I like to use I use try to
delight I'm a serial gum swaller gum was
actually not allowed in my high school
so I just got into the habit of if I had
gum and someone came like walking by I
would just swallow it immediately just
because you would get caught that way no
word on what the inside of my intestines
look like I don't like dicks gum I like
this whitening gum not even because of
like a whitening aspect though that is
good I just like the initial crunch and
mint inna stuff like that more
satisfying this little bag is like my
mini makeup bag that I got from Ipsy
this bag can actually handle my larger
like makeup travel bag if I'm like doing
my makeup somewhere else or sometimes I
just don't want to leave my makeup at
home alone but if I'm just running out
to do something for an evening I'll you
should take one of these smaller bags
inside are a few things a little bit of
a pressed powder I usually use a loose
powder to set my face I just carry this
around kind of as like blotting powder
this powder is absolutely at the bottom
of I have hit pan but there is some of
the edges and I will not revive this
until I'm completely done with this and
that's how I feel
the next thing is this little brush from
ELF it is not really supposed to be like
an all-over face powder brush but it's
just really small so I can you know just
put it in this little FC bag so I just
take it around and it's just kind of
like you know block away I have a mini
Too Faced better than sex mascara just
in case I saw this is the Lindholm art
liner I really love this eyeliner this
is currently my Holy Grail eyeliner help
to have my brow pencil the anastasia or
honest hacia Beverly Hills brow definer
in evidence and then I had my
stuff down here just kidding Isles out
some concealer my next concealer in
beige this is my number one favorite
lipstick for my top 10 favorite
lipsticks video the Urban Decay vice
lipstick in oblivion you know I'm not
wearing this lipstick that day I'm like
just in case everything goes wrong I'll
just put this on just as a backup always
I have to colour-pop lippie stix in here
I have one colour-pop lippie stix in wit
is a pearlized grey one this color is
pillow top in the math X formula of the
colour-pop lippie stix I really love how
it feels it's kind of powdery if that
makes sense
I've used it a lot and I can tell
because the blade will completely come
off I also have the stuff that we used
for the first video that I put up a
couple days ago so I have the cap on the
everlasting liquid lipsticks and the
flocking powder you just you never know
when the time will be right ignoring the
receive do you think when we see the
receipts it's like sticking out of here
as if it was a mess
Oh next sunglasses don't worry there's
no case involved they were just
free-balling it in there these are from
Amazon I don't know the name of a
company that sells these I have never
lost a pair of these but I have
oftentimes thought that I lost the
parents gone online very sad needing to
rebuy these because I need these in my
life either my favorite sunglasses I
think I've ever owned I just go to
Amazon I search black cat eye sunglasses
and just scroll until I find these the
ones I buy because I think I have three
pairs of these at this point are all
between like eight and like 15 bucks so
do you see a pair of these that are
between 8 and 15 dollars that's probably
the right one carry my keys on my keys I
have a Ralph's reward card at the
grocery store for those of you don't
live on the East Coast
I have APO box key my house key my
mailbox key and then I also have a yoga
works little mini shmatte I used to have
a little alien guy used to hang off my
keychain but he fell off I do have him
somewhere in my teeth are you know a
little more drab for the loss of him the
last thing I have before we go through
the rest of the receipts so just at the
bottom I bag is my iPhone I just almost
dropped it but didn't this case I
absolutely love it's from Sonics there's
little eyes but they're not evil eyes
necessarily
eyes that have like little stars at the
end of the lashes they're just cute eyes
so this is a success which means that it
is like one generation old so they have
the seven but I have a conspiracy theory
that they make your iPhone's work a
little bit worse once the newer iPhone
comes out to kind of make you want to
buy a newer one listen Tim Cook whoever
you are I'm on the edge track I don't
want to buy the seven
I may buy two 7s in fact there probably
will next year because then I will have
had this phone for two years
stop trying to get me to buy to seven
let this film live its life so I have to
say Tim Cook now let's just go through
these things one at a time and see what
we have this is a pink hot dog receipt
from when we were also wearing a
scurrilous got a chili dog a Betty White
dog and a Moe Holland dogs distance
literal trash oh you know what this is
the bag of mini doughnuts from the fur
lift video and there's just a lot of
cinnamon sugar at the bottom
starbuck straw wrapper another straw
wrapper ooh
veggie grill man I love as you roll a
ticket to a musical fun home great
musical check it out this is a parking
receipt this is also from veggie grill
but it looks completely different target
Glendale ooh I got my acne wash I use
Alba acne don't grow a corner whoo let's
see what stage this organ crater lake
nerve end organ but I would love to go
and I hope even receipt for the screws
for my screw verses mascara wand video
you know I probably should've as I was
going through those receipts organized
and betters for which ones I want
achieve in which was I didn't want to
keep so I'm gonna have to go through
those again here's another straw wrapper
yeah so that's my bag I really love
watching these kinds of videos so I'm
really glad I finally like to do my own
finally got to show you guys the craft
that I had at the bottom of my bag so I
could probably now go and try and so
this drop back on
like in you know not drop everything
that I have in the middle of the street
