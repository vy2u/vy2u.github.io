video today I'm going to be talking
about why I left BuzzFeed this is a very
requested video topic a lot of you guys
have been asking me about this and I
want to be as open and honest as
possible with you guys I did leave
BuzzFeed about six weeks ago right at
the end of January I wanted to wait to
make this video just until all the
videos that I was in that were like
pre-recorded with me and them were
already posted on BuzzFeed Channel so
there was no confusion about that just
in case there's anyone watching who
doesn't know me I was a video producer
at BuzzFeed video I worked there from
April of 2015 until the end of January
of 2017 and I worked exclusively on this
show called ladylike from October of
2015 until when I left in January 2017
so before I get started I just want to
say that these are the reasons why I
left not necessarily the same reasons
why someone else may have left or
reasons why someone else might not stay
I'm not trying to speak for anyone else
but myself BuzzFeed is a pretty big
company with a lot of different types of
jobs and a lot of different teams and
some of the things that I experienced
that made me want to leave someone else
might not even experience a lot of
people at BuzzFeed also have different
backgrounds and different career goals
so I respect everyone's decision to stay
or not stay or do whatever they want
with their careers everyone has their
own path I'm also not here to trash
BuzzFeed or to nitpick everything I
don't like about the company I don't
think there are a lot of people who like
everything about the company that they
work for or have worked for I know that
there might be some people watching for
whom BuzzFeed is not their favorite
thing but I'm just here to tell you guys
the reasons why I left and not to trash
the company so the overarching reason
why I left BuzzFeed is to have
independence and for me that means a few
things but I'll start off with
transparency and by transparency I mean
transparency and open lines of
communication between myself and you
guys watch it one of the main things
that bothered me was that I was not
supposed to communicate with you guys on
YouTube and what I mean by that is that
we were told not to read the comments
but further than that we were not
supposed to reply to any comments in the
comment section on the videos that we
made a lot of you guys might know how
much I love talking to you guys on
social media but I was never allowed to
talk to you guys on YouTube so if there
was a comment that I really loved or
something I thought was really funny in
the comments I couldn't say that I liked
it
and if there was a question or a
misconception I couldn't clarify
anything and I think that's a big part
of YouTube being able to talk to the
people watching another point on
transparency is that there's really no
clarity to the viewers about what videos
producers do at BuzzFeed and which
videos they make for example a lot of
people thought that I was an actress for
BuzzFeed and didn't know that I not only
made a lot of videos for lady like I
actually started ladylike with Freddie
because our names aren't attached the
videos that we make people would often
ask me to explain or answer for videos
or even articles that will produce by
other people that I had nothing to do
with that were sometimes made on the
other side of the country or the other
side of the world and that would often
put me in a little bit of a sticky
situation because I didn't want to speak
for other people or what they had
created the only thing that I could
speak for was ladylike so the lack of
transparency between BuzzFeed and you
guys kind of made me both not able to
take credit for the work that I did but
also maybe overly accountable for
decisions that were made in other parts
of the company that I had nothing to do
it there were also issues with
transparency within the company over the
15 months I worked on ladylike we could
never really get a clear answer from
higher-ups as to where they saw the show
going or what they thought the future of
ladylike was we did have a lot of
meetings of higher-ups in fact most of
what we heard was through the grapevine
but we did have one meeting which is
pretty confusing a lot of it was about
changing the direction of the show but
maybe making the format stricter but
then also maybe abandoning the format
altogether all in all it was pretty
confusing and this lack of transparency
in particular leads me to my next point
and the next reason I wanted to leave
which is that I wanted more
responsibility
so when lady-like first started out it
wasn't exactly be darling of BuzzFeed
the first episode had some support
because it was supposed to be a new show
on the top not Facebook page which at
the time was about beauty and style but
then Todd not was changed to be solely
about hair tutorials so after the first
episode ladylike it didn't have a place
there we were told up nor allowed to
keep making ladylike but it wasn't
really a part of BuzzFeed's big picture
plan so Freddie and I kept making
ladylike episodes because we really pop
up there with something there and there
were actually other people at BuzzFeed
who really believed in ladylike too and
stepped in to help out and we really all
wanted to work on it and prove it so
over the next couple months later I
began to gain momentum and was actually
you can become a real team at BuzzFeed
which meant that we got more resources
and we got a couple more producers put
on the project full-time which was
awesome and exactly what we wanted
because it was finally becoming a thing
but as time went on it felt like
big-picture strategizing and
responsibilities were taken away from us
we were still expected to come up with
the ideas for ladylike episodes and
produce a majority of them but Freddy
and I were not included in any high
level conversations about ladylike what
I mean by that is like conversations
about possible collaborations
partnerships what's going to be on our
Facebook page our playlists and things
as small as like the branding like what
font we're going to be using and that
was pretty frustrating to me and when I
express my frustration and my desire to
be included in those kinds of meetings
the answer was this is how things are
this is the way the company works and
that's not your role and that made me
have to step back and realize that my
job with video producer and they were
right and that I was never going to be
able to get the kind of responsibility
that I wanted at Bubby's another saying
was this awkward dynamic where my name
and my face were really associated with
BuzzFeed and with ladylike but I didn't
own any part of ladylike and I also
wasn't included in any of the higher
level strategy conversations about the
show itself so my real name and my face
were associated with something that I
had no ownership over just kind of fed
into a sticky situation when the idea of
creating merchandise with our names on
it came up because to me it felt like we
were getting close to BuzzFeed being
able to sell something under my name
which is not really what I signed up for
so when you agree to work at BuzzFeed
you know that you're not going to be
owning the content that you make for
them I actually think that that's pretty
common practice with companies like
BuzzFeed and also in the entertainment
world in general especially early in
people's careers if you make a show and
sell that show to a studio this studio
will own that show although in most
cases even if a company or studio owns
it you still get credited which is
something that Leslie doesn't do but you
make a trade-off when you work for
BuzzFeed you get some content and they
give you resources it's a job and it
pays the bill I have no question that
making lady-like on such a big platform
with an amazing opportunity and I
learned so much at BuzzFeed and I'm so
thankful for all the opportunities they
gave me and everything that I learned
there but I think there is a difference
between
them owning the content that I made for
them which is what I signed up for when
I started working there and then owning
my name which is a line that we didn't
cross but I think that we were
approaching and that's another reason
why I left I think in general my goals
and the company's goals has been aligned
anymore and I know to some of you guys
it might have seemed like an abrupt
decision but for me I made this decision
over time and it just felt like the
right time to me for some people who
work at BuzzFeed having their own
YouTube channel is not something that
they're interested in but for me it's
something I've been interested in for a
really long time and so that's what I
did I left BuzzFeed at the end of
January and since then I've been
focusing 100% of my energy into posting
videos on this channel I just want to
say I have no hard feelings towards
BuzzFeed or towards anyone who works for
BuzzFeed I've been really loving being
able to make my own videos and being
able to connect with you guys more and
my only sadness with all of this is that
they won't be able to work with a girl
on ladylike anymore Brady was actually
able to be in a couple of videos on my
channel right when I left BuzzFeed but
it doesn't look like that's going to be
possible anymore nor with any of the
other ladylike girls
hopefully one day that changes because I
would love to have them on this channel
and work with them again but in the
meantime you've seen that I've been
working with Candice Candice actually
left BuzzFeed in the middle of last year
and I've been really loving working with
her and I also have plans to collaborate
with people who are outside the buzz be
cool and I'm really excited about that
too if you guys want to watch the videos
I've already made you can click this
playlist right here and if you want to
see more videos not necessarily like
this but more like that kind of stuff
you can smash that subscribe button
because I would love to have you for the
people that requested this video I hope
that this is what you guys are looking
for I will see you guys later this week
with more regular programming in fact
that'll be Tuesday so we should probably
film that like right now but I will see
you guys a next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
