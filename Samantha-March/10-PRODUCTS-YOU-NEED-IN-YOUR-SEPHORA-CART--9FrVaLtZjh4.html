today's video is going to be 10 things I
think you should have in your cart
Sephora this was a requested video from
a subscriber I saw come in I believe it
was on Twitter and I thought okay that
sounds like fun I can do that I spent
the morning going through the Sephora
website I went through my Sephora loves
list I went through my collection and I
thought what do I have from Sephora that
I am constantly reaching for myself or
that I find myself consistently
recommending in my videos so I had ten
different items that I wanted to share
that I think that you should have in
your cart at Sephora if you don't
already have these of of course but I do
have everything from makeup to skincare
and also brushes that I want to
recommend from Sephora so I'm super
excited to create this video and thank
you so much if we're requesting it I
love working off requests before we get
started I want to say thank you so much
for clicking on this video if you have
not subscribed yet I hope that you'll
consider subscribing I do post a video
every single day so if you want to get
daily content on makeup and beauty make
sure to subscribe before you go I do
have a 20k giveaway going on right now
for both YouTube and Instagram I have
two separate makeup giveaways going on
right now so those will be linked in the
description box down below but if you
would like to see ten things I think you
should have in your cart at Sephora why
don't we go ahead and get started so I
do want to say if you saw yesterday's
video on my best and worst drugstore
foundations I want to tell you guys know
that my air conditioning is now working
our air conditioner broke and it was it
was very very sad and I filmed the
yesterday's video in my 86 degree office
and it was so miserable but luckily I
have a very handy husband and he got it
fixed so we are now back to normal
thankfully so the first item I want to
talk about is one that I have
repurchased over and over and over again
it is actually a makeup brush cleaner
and it is from a cinema secret so this
is just their makeup brush cleaner but
it is a quick drying rinse free brush
cleaner so this is what it looks like I
typically will buy this guy but then I
also have this a bottle it's just the
exact same thing but what I do is I take
this and then I use this to refill it
because then when I
Travel I take this versus this it's just
a lot easier I did just finish using
this the last thing that I went out of
town and I brought it with me so I need
to refill again but I really do I've
gone through so many bottles of this I
honestly don't even know if I could
count because I use it so often what it
is good for is to like spot clean that
your brushes this is not any sort of
like deep clean method for your brushes
and it should not replace that method
because you do need to deep clean your
makeup brushes otherwise that's very
very gross but it's really nice
especially if you have a smaller brush
collection because when I first started
and I didn't have like the insane amount
of makeup brushes that I have now I had
to blending brushes and sometimes you
need more than two blending brushes when
you're doing an eyelid but the worst
thing ever is to have one shadow on the
brush and then you go in with a
different shadow and it messes
everything up so you can use this in
between the different colors to clean
off your brushes because it doesn't
actually make your brushes wet you don't
have to worry about drying them waiting
for them to dry or anything like that so
what I'll do is I'll just spray a couple
times right on the brush and then I'll
rub it on like a paper towel and you
will see the shadow disappear like it's
really pretty freakin amazing and I
think it's awesome I think it was coffee
break with Danny that introduced me to
the cinema secrets a while ago and I
have continually repurchases it's just
incredibly handy to have no matter if
you have a small brush collection or if
you have a larger brush collection
because even though I have a larger
brush collection now there's definitely
my favorite brushes that I have and I
find myself having to clean them up
quite a bit so I only deep clean my
brushes maybe like every two or three
weeks so in between I use this all the
time and I really have gone through so
many bottles you have three different
sizes so this is like the small and then
this is the medium and then they also
have a bigger one and the price range is
anywhere from $8 I think is the smallest
one and then $39 is going to be the
biggest one and then this one is $24
times if I see that I'm running low like
towards the Sephora vib sale I will just
add this to my cart but I really don't
want to be caught without this because
it comes in handy for me so much so I
definitely recommend that the cinema
secrets makeup brush cleaner is awesome
speaking of makeup brushes I do have a
favorite makeup brush
actually from the Sephora collection
that I think you should put in your cart
because this is hands-down one of my
absolute favorite brushes and I use it
every single day and it is no joke every
day that I put makeup on I use the
Sephora number 57 brush it is their Pro
airbrush concealer this is what the
brush looks like he says for a couple
different reasons one is when I put
concealer on my eyes or I prime her on
my eyes I will use this to blend it I
also use it for concealer under my eyes
or anywhere else and I'm putting
concealer on my face this is the brush
that I use seem like a really random
thing or a random brush to put in here
but I'm telling you this is the only
brush that I like to use for that
purpose I have other brushes that look
like this that are shaped like this that
say that they are concealer brushes but
this is the brush I use anybody asked
for a brush recommendation for those
specific tasks I'm always recommending
this before 57 because like I said I do
use it every single day when I travel
this brush I mean it has to come with me
I feel like I need to get a replacement
because I've had this for so many years
I have washed it so many times but it is
still in a really good condition in a
really good shape I'm just super
impressed with this it does not falling
apart at all the handle everything is
fine on it so it is $24 I will have it
linked down below of course been telling
you this is a brush that I have to have
one of my favorite all-time makeup
brushes and it's from the Sephora
collection which I thought was kind of
fun because I don't own a ton up from
the Sephora collection but this brush
has definitely made me want to try more
of their makeup brushes the skincare
that I want to talk about that you can
find at Sephora is the first aid beauty
a facial radiance pad I do have a
skincare favorites video coming up
shortly and you're going to see these in
there of course I have repurchased the
facial radiance past and first day
Beauty multiple times over it will never
catch me without facial radiance pads in
my skincare collection they are some of
my favorites what they do is they help
to exfoliate tone and brighten the skin
I do think it's nice too because you can
buy these in different sizes so they
have 60 pads for 30 dollars or you can
do 28 pads for $15 night
just little pads here and then they are
soaked with product they're super
convenient I always take these traveling
with me you just rub them all over your
face and that's pretty much it but
they're super easy to use I typically
buy the big guys when I first started I
first found first aid beauty I bought
like a set from them and it came with
like an even miniature size of the
facial radiance pads and I loved him and
I went on and bought the little jar and
now I just buy the big jars because I
cook through them so often and they are
really some of my favorites at first a
beauty is good for sensitive skin it's
kind of how I found for say beauty
because I do have sensitive skin and I
saw this being recommended so low facial
radiance had some first aid beauty I
feel like I've been recommending these
now for a couple years so I definitely
think that they should go in your
Sephora cart a foundation that I
absolutely love and I have recommend it
so often is the Clinique beyond
perfecting a foundation and concealer
when this came out it got quite a bit of
buzz I would say a lot of people were
making videos on it where tests and
first impressions and all that and I
still see people using this foundation a
lot it wasn't one of those that got a
lot of buzz that release and then just
kind of fade it into nothing people are
still using this still putting in their
tutorials and I definitely still reach
for my clinic to be on perfecting quite
a bit I do recommend this a lot not just
on YouTube I recommended this to my
friend Shannon when she got married this
is the foundation that she wore on her
wedding day because it is a full
coverage foundation is also very very
long-lasting if that was what the
applicator looks like so it's like a
really big concealer wand almost and
then you can just make some strips on
your face I typically will use this only
for a foundation and then I can use it
with a little bit of a lighter hand to
spot conceal any spots that I want to
cover up I don't use it as like an
under-eye concealer or anything like
that my shade is in buttermilk but again
a nice full coverage foundation that
doesn't feel super heavy on the skin
because I don't like cakey heavy
foundation so some chemical coverage can
scare me but this one I actually do
enjoy again very long lasting it won't
make you overly dewy but it's not going
to be super super mattifying on the skin
though I would say that this one tends
to lean more towards the matte side and
I do reach for this in the summer quite
a bit when I can tend
get a little bit more oily in the hot
weather also this foundation is only $28
for the standard 1 ounce which I do not
think is a bad price at all instead of
paying in 30s 40s or even more expensive
for high-end foundations
I think $28 is an absolute steal so if
you haven't yet tried the Clinique
beyond perfecting a foundation I
definitely say that you should put this
in your sephora card moving on to a
couple products for the eyes if you have
not tried these please put them in your
sephora card I've been recommending them
like crazy and so has so many other
people it is the Marc Jacob highliners
okay leave our awesome I have three
different shades here I want more I want
the light pink one that one looks so
pretty as mine and overt this is a
really nice like deep green I wear this
so often I also have Orange Crush which
is orange and then I have Odyssey which
is a nice kind of teal blue these are
fantastic eyeliners they are $25 so they
are more expensive but they are worth it
because they work these are one of the
absolute best eyeliners that I've ever
tried very creamy super pigmented you
don't have to like tug or fuss or press
hard or anything with these eyeliners
they will just glide right on to the
waterline and they are very long-lasting
these are the eyeliners where when I am
taking my makeup off at night I have to
actually like pull my eye down and rub
the makeup remover on my waterline
because just splashing my eyes that no
they're not they're not gonna go
anywhere so the mark Jacob highliners
they're $25 I know they are more
expensive but if you want a good all day
long wear beautiful eyeliner I would
suggest to put these in your card and I
was trying to think of an eyeshadow
palette the one I kept coming to was one
of my newer eyeshadow palettes but I've
just been absolutely loving this guy and
I'm finding myself recommending it so
much
it is the Tarte clay play palette I do
think one of the big reasons why I am
especially drawn to this palette is
because not only still have the
eyeshadows but it also has face powders
here as well
I use this middle shade as a contour
shade and I use this one on the end as a
rahzar and I just absolutely love the
kind of like convenience I'll say that I
am super attracted to both the contour
shade and the bronzer shade that I use
in the palette when I am looking for a
bronzer I keep finding myself going for
this one because I absolutely love them
but these map shades are beautiful if
you love neutrals if you are a matte
lover you would absolutely adore this
palette again I keep recommending it it
is newer but I have to say that I
absolutely loved it when I was trying to
think of what I could recommend as an
eyeshadow I thought I'm gonna mention
this one because it's kind of like the
2-1-1 that you can probably get either a
contour or a bronzer shade out of here
if these don't work for your skin tone
you can also use these as eyeshadows or
you can mix and match to the eyeshadows
and use them as a face powder as well I
know this can also be used as eyeliners
even people use them as brow powders so
it's such a handy convenient palette and
has a great mirror at highly recommend
it the Tarte clay play palette is 46
dollars but you're getting so much in
here I adore it I would highly recommend
that you put this in your card so if you
love a good highlight like me I would
recommend checking out Becca cosmetics I
have quite a few highlights from Becca
cosmetics I really love them the very
first Becca highlight I ever got was
opal I got this little guy to try out
and that's kind of like what started my
obsession with the biker highlights I
have the champagne pop highlight which
is in collaboration with Jaclyn hill I
also have the Jaclyn hill face palette
it has two of the Becca highlights in
here and then I most recently got the
Becca and Chrissy Teigan base palette
sent to me from a subscriber which is so
amazing and that has two highlights in
here as well and I have recently been
completely obsessed with this my lights
down here would really recommend the
Becca highlights champagne pop I think
is still hands-down one of my favorite
highlights it was supposed to be limited
edition I believe because it wasn't
collaboration with Jaclyn hill usually
collabs our limited edition but it is a
permanent feature now this I have a lot
of different versions of the champagne
pop highlight so maybe kinds of pending
on what you prefer for a highlight do
you like the powder highlight do you
like more of a liquid highlight they
have more options as well that I would
say to put champ and pop in your card or
maybe a champagne pop doesn't flow your
boat just check out the different Becca
highlight
because there are a lot of different
options she's got new ones out right now
the Sun tracer highlights I think
they're called the light chaser
highlights
well something chase our highlights are
out right now as well I know a lot of
people are really loving them and I
would definitely suggest if I could
Cosmetics and putting one of the
highlights in your cart another item
that I recommend quite a bit from
Sephora is their Sephora favorite
collections I'll have a link to just the
Sephora favorite collection page down
below there's always a lot of different
items and products that you can buy in a
collection and I really like them
because you're able to try out a lot of
different brands and different products
typically you're getting smaller sizes
but sometimes there's full sizes in
there as well and you're getting them
for a really good price and I just think
it's awesome makeup is so hard to
actually go through so even though we
love the full-size products and that's
fantastic and great it just makes more
sense to have a sample size because it's
easier to go through but B if you get to
try something and you know you don't
really love it you're not wasting a
full-sized product which i think is
great I just pulled this out because
it's one of my this is my most recent
Sephora favorites this is one of the
give me some nude lip collections I
physically buy all of the give me some
nude lip collections because I'm a nude
lip lover I can't help it there's a new
one that's coming out soon I'm waiting
anxiously for it let me know if you guys
would want me to do my normal swatch
video like I've been doing when the new
nude collections come out but they have
a lipsticks they have mascara they have
skincare and they have summer focused
collections I'm they're always coming
out with new Sephora favorites
collections and sometimes you're getting
a steal on what you are getting in those
collections and for the price that you
are getting self have been able to find
items that I have fallen in love with
because I've gotten him into Sephora
favorites collection that maybe I
wouldn't have bought on my own but
because I was able to try them out it's
made me fall in love with a product so I
just think these are really cool I'm
always recommending the Sephora
favorites so I'll have the page listed
down below go through it see if there's
anything that really catches your eye I
tend to think that these are a pretty
good deal so the Sephora favorites you
should put one in your card so the last
two items that I wanted to talk about
are going to be both lip products I try
to do a different category for each of
the products
I cannot have multiple foundations in
here or multiple eyeshadow palettes or
things like that but I am gonna feature
two different lip products a because I
am a lip junkie but I also am going to
recommend a liquid lipstick and then
more of the regular lipstick because I
know not everybody loves liquid lipstick
but I know some people really prefer
look what lipstick so I thought I could
do both so the regular lipstick that I
would recommend is actually one that I
tried in a Sephora favorites give me
some nude lip collection and I have been
pretty much obsessed with them ever
since is from Marc Jacobs it is the
Lamarck lip creme lipstick so this is a
smaller guy because it did come in the
sephora favorites but man this is a good
lipstick this I feel like I can blame
for kicking off my obsession with Marc
Jacobs beauty ever since getting this I
then tried out another lipstick formula
from Marc Jacobs because I was so
impressed loved it I've been getting
highlights from Marc Jacobs
loved it got the eye liners from Marc
Jacobs love them but this guy is like
what started it all so it's it's just
this little lipsticks fault so this is
what my lipstick looks like this one is
in the shade
slow burn and pretty sure yep slow burn
this is slow burn a beautiful like mauve
nude lipstick it is so gorgeous but the
formula is amazing the full sizes are
$30 and I really promise you that I
would not recommend a $30 lipstick if I
didn't like have my all into it but I
love this I even take this guy traveling
with me and I myself prefer a liquid
lipstick I just like how long-lasting
they are and I typically tend to reach
for the liquid lipsticks but this guy
always has to come with me too because I
love it and it is a very long wear
formula it's going to stick around on
the lips for a very long time it doesn't
wear away super easily like a regular
lipstick but it's not a liquid lipstick
at all it doesn't feel like one it's not
drying or anything but it definitely has
a long wear power that I do not see in a
lot of regular lipstick formulas the
Marc Jacobs Lamarck creme lipsticks are
so good I say put one in your cart but
liquid lipstick I want to recommend is
probably going to be no surprise because
I talked about these as so often but
they are the huda beauty liquid
lipsticks I am completely enamored with
these I have bought so many these I
bought in a set so they are mini guys I
think I have two full sizes as well I
can't find them in my office which means
that they are probably in my purse I'm
actually pretty sure I have one in my
purse and one in my like crossbody that
I take when we're like going out in a
bar like to a concert or something I
take my crossbody with me I think I have
a Buddha lipstick in both of those
purses because that is how much I love
them they go everywhere with me
incredibly long-lasting I mean I was
raving about these in my top 10 nude
liquid lipsticks so long-lasting I warm
as a bridesmaid and it lasted me from 3
o'clock in the afternoon until 2:00 a.m.
it stayed on without any touch-ups
through dinner I still think it looked
fabulous just some of my favorite liquid
lipsticks it's a very thin almost watery
formula but it makes it comfortable on
the lips it's not dry it's not going to
like make your lips crack and like look
and feel gross they are a little sticky
like some people tell me like you don't
like it because of how sticky they are
just wait a little bit I know when you
first put them on they can be sticky but
I just wait maybe like 10 minutes and
then the sticky factor goes away for me
so I just love these I reach for them so
much
definitely recommend the kid that she
has out now at Sephora I'll have it link
down below where you get four of the
mini liquid lipsticks for $33 the
full-size of these are going to be $20
so you're getting four minis for 33
that's still a really decent sized
lipstick you know if you have a big
lipstick collection or your lipstick
lover then you probably have more than I
don't know 5 lipsticks you know that it
takes a while to go through a lipstick
so to get 4 minis for 33 I do not think
is a bad price at all I've been
recommending the hooded lipsticks ever
since I bought the first one I've gone
on to purchase many more of these and
I'm just a big big fan I definitely
recommend these for your support card ok
that's gonna be everything for my 10
products that I think you should have in
your Sephora card I really hope that you
