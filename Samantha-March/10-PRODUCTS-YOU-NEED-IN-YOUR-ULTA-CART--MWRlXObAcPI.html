today's video is going to be 10 items
that you need in your alte card I did
this video maybe like two months ago or
so but it was 10 items that I think that
you need in your Sephora cards and a lot
of people requested that I do it for
Alta as well so that's exactly what we
are doing today I have 5 drugstore
affordable type of products and then I
have 5
more high-end products that I'm going to
share with you totaling 10 things that
you need in your Ulta card I also try to
do brands that you can't find at Sephora
so if you are ready to see 10 products
that I think you need to put in your
altar card if you don't have them
already why don't we go ahead and get
started so first I'm gonna start with
some eyeshadow palettes the first one
that I would recommend if you do not own
this one yet is the BH Cosmetics and
Carli bybel eyeshadow palette this is
the deluxe edition actually of the
palette so inside you are getting a 21-9
shadows and also highlighters in here
this is what it looks like on the inside
there is a big ol mirror here and you
have all of these eyeshadows and then
you have all of these beautiful
highlighters this is a fantastic palette
I mentioned it recently in my favorite a
limited edition make a video I will
leave that one a link down below I just
think it is such good quality for only
$22.50 you are getting everything in
this palette and that is not bad
especially compared to what some other
drugstore brands are doing to us right
now okay okay I was really excited when
BH Cosmetics did come into Altima I have
been buying from BH Cosmetics for a very
long time because of Carli bybel Carli
bybel was the first beauty youtuber that
I ever started watching on YouTube and
she was always using BH Cosmetics and
recommending BH Cosmetics into a
beginner like me back then I bought a
Aladdin pH cosmetics allowed at BH
brushes a lot of BH eyeshadows I had a
ton from BH Cosmetics so I thought that
was really cool to see Carly do a
collaboration with a more affordable
brand they are a recent brand to Ulta
Ulta has been getting so many new brands
in which is very exciting and made this
video even more fun to do to record out
of this so I was excited to see BH in
there because they are a more affordable
brand and now you can get some of their
items over at Ulta like I said this is
$22.50 and you are getting a ton of
different eyeshadows and a huge variety
of highlighters down here whatever you
like for your highlight there's some
sort of option in here so I think this
is absolutely beautiful and I would
HIGHLY
if you do not own it yet and everything
that I'm mentioning of course will be
linked down below a more high-end
eyeshadow palette that I would also
recommend this is from dose of colors
this is the marvelous mobs eyeshadow
palette I was new to trying a dose of
color sincere this is another brand that
that is new too coming in Ulta dose of
colors can only find online at Ulta a
lot of times when they are bringing in
new brands such as Joseph's colors they
don't have inventory in the fiscal
stories yet you can only get them online
so I did want to point that out with
those of colors but I was so excited to
see them come into Ulta and I
immediately started purchasing items
from them
the marvelous mob's eyeshadow palette
though is so good if moths are not your
thing they do also have a baked brown
eyeshadow palette that everybody says is
just as fantastic as the mauve one so if
Browns are more of your shade I would
suggest getting the baked Brown so you
do get five eyeshadows they are of
course in the ma family and this is a
very cool tone palette I know a lot of
people say they get pretty frustrated
with all the warm tones that are coming
out so if you do like cool tones and you
do like mops I would suggest this
palette it does have the mirror here it
also comes with a brush and the brush is
actually pretty decent I do use a brush
quite often which is pretty shocking
with eyeshadow palettes because
typically I cast the brush aside but
that one is very good I take this when
traveling with me a lot I love reaching
for it I think the eyeshadows are super
high quality there is a ton of kick up
with this palette so don't be alarmed
when you first start using it just make
sure you tap your brush off very very
well before you go in with the shadows
on your eyes this palette is going to
run you a $32 but again I do think it is
very good quality eyeshadow palette so I
would recommend marvelous moths I showed
a fellow from and dose of colors so a
drugstore lipstick that I highly
recommend and that I own so many of and
I have been buying for so long is it
from NYX Cosmetics these are the soft
matte lip creams I'm always talking
about the soft matte lip creams I asked
the other day on Twitter what is like a
holy girl item that I would recommend
from alpha and my answer was the NYX
soft matte lip cream because I do own
quite a bit of these I repurchase
several shades this one right here is
alpha Dobby ivory purchased this one I
know I have repurchased London think
they are really nice they feel very soft
on the lips but they are matte they are
not completely transfer proof but they
do last a long time and they are very
easy to build up and they have a huge
variety of colors like no matter what
color it is that you want
get they are going to have it on the
auto website these run about six dollars
sometimes NYX does a special for you
know if I won't get one free so I always
just kind of keep an eye out for that if
there's any colors that I need to stock
up on with the NYX lipsticks but if you
are looking for a good drugstore
lipstick I do recommend it the NYX soft
matte lip creams the more high-end
lipsticks that I absolutely enjoyed this
is a new one to me as well because this
is a new brand to Ulta yes I mean I love
all those reward points okay you guys
like I can't like also reward system is
friggin bomb it's way better than
Sephora in my opinion but these are the
ofra liquid lipsticks so I tried the
over liquid lipsticks for the first time
with just a couple months ago and I
immediately fell in love with them this
shade in particular is Manila I believe
I'm wearing it in my last video which
was my makeup declutter video I'm
wearing Manila in there and I just think
it is absolutely gorgeous it is such a
beautiful nude I also really enjoy
Bellaire from Oprah those are two of my
favorites right now from Alfred but I
highly recommend these I said that they
are long lasting liquid lipsticks and I
would agree
I used a liquid lipstick I can't
remember it was Manila or Bel Air in my
sweat proof makeup tested video and I
put this on in the afternoon a dinner
with it I went and played volleyball and
like 90 degree heat and my lipstick
looked fantastic at the end of the night
like even I was amazed I was amazed at
that so I do highly recommend these I
think they're very comfortable on the
lips they are not super drying but they
look really beautiful again if you like
nudes if you have my type of skin tone
and you enjoy nudes
I would suggest checking out the Manila
these are $17 on the Ulta website and I
highly recommend the ofra liquid
lipsticks if you are looking for a good
makeup tool that is also affordable I
highly recommend that you add the
L'Oreal a makeup sponge to your card
because this is one of my absolute
favorite makeup sponges this is $7.99
which is not a bad price at all I love
the shape of it I love this real pointed
tip that helps you really get up in
there underneath the eyes it's been
hands-down one of my favorite beauty
sponges I need to add another one to my
card because this one has been washed
over and over and over and over and over
again because even though I have so many
sponges like I'm looking at all of them
right now I have so many sponges I keep
finding myself reaching for this one
because I just think it is one of the
bus so if you really enjoy beauty
sponges too
apply your makeup with and you're
looking for a more affordable option
than something like the beauty blender
which is in the $20 range I suggest you
look at the l'oreal one I include some
skincare in here as well and I thought I
would mention a sheet mask I just have
mentioned this in my favorites portion
of my make it monthly recently have that
one that linked down below but is the
patch ology smart mud no mess mud mask I
love these because I love things like
mud mask and charcoal masks and masks
that really suck everything out of your
pores I find myself using mud baths a
lot Audia their Sundays or Monday's like
recovering from the weekend getting
everything out of your skin out of your
pores that is what I reach for but I
always struggled with traditional mask
because they are so messy like your
hands are messy your hair is messy or
sink is messy the towels to wash your
face everything is messy that was the
only thing that would frustrate me about
them it to the point where I actually
started using them only in my shower
because it was just so much easier to
rinse everything away and make my shower
dirty instead of my sink I know it's
crazy but that is a true story this is
what I've really done and I started
trying at the pachala G sheet mask it is
how it says a no-mess mud mask there is
no mess to this it's a really cool it
actually is in two sections so you take
them off and I just put it right on my
face because it's like extremely sticky
and then I just peel off the protective
layering and you do the bottom half of
your face and then the top half of your
face and all you have to do is leave it
on for ten minutes one thing I really
like about the pachala G mass is that
you don't have to leave them on for like
the twenty or thirty minutes like you
have to do for some masks they have a
ton of five-minute sheet masks this one
is a ten minute one and at ten minutes
you just take it off and throw it away
there's no mess to it sometimes there is
a little bit of like residue left over
on your face but once you first rinse it
real quick like boom you're done not
even your towels going to get dirty
it's pretty amazing to do and join the
pathology mask these are more expensive
at $8 but if you are someone like me who
you love sheet masks and sometimes you
pay a little bit extra a for a really
good sheet mask I would say check out at
the patch ology no mess mud mask
foundation that I recently tried out
this year but ended up falling in love
with I know this has been mentioned in a
favorites category in the past this is
from a number seven this is Thursday
perfect foundation it's actually the
foundation that I am wearing today
really number seven on a hole has very
much intrigue
this year I was able to try them out for
the first time because they did send me
over a PR package and I have just been
loving everything from them from their
foundation I have their bronzer and
blush on today their concealer
I've been trying out their skincare and
I highly enjoy it as well if you haven't
checked out number seven I really do
suggest that you do but if you've been
looking for a new a foundation I would
suggest checking out at least a perfect
foundation it is a medium coverage
foundation just like the way it sits on
my skin I like the way it makes my skin
look I just mm-hmm I really enjoyed
reaching for this my shade if you are
curious I'm wearing warm beige right now
I have also warned cool beige and I like
both of them on my skin in case you want
a point of reference for shade matching
this is $15.99 so I kind of feel like
number 7 can kind of get up there in
price a little bit but you can find them
at drugstores like Walgreens as well and
you know it also sometimes they'll have
specials and then I've even seen that
specials at Walgreens I have also seen
these at Walgreens with testers which is
very rare for drugstores to be able to
let us test and try to shade match in
the actual store so when I saw that
number 7 had a whole wall of testers
with all of their different foundations
their different lip colors and things
like that I was even more impressed so
if you're looking for a good medium
coverage kind of all-day wear foundation
because I put that one to the test with
this I'd recommend the number 7 s stay
perfect
so this brand is not new to Ulta they've
been sold it also for quite some time in
many many years now but this product is
new to the line and now I just saw like
five days ago maybe that these items are
now tulta and I got so excited I wanted
to tell everybody it is the pure false
eyelashes you need to put these in your
cart you need to put these in your cart
and then you need to thank me later and
everything will be a-okay because these
are my favorite lashes at the moment I
talked about them so much if you follow
me on Instagram and I'm always sharing
like make it photos and things like that
if you look at the caption is pure
lashes pure lashes pure lashes pure
lashes I own so many pure lashes it's a
little out of hand and now that their
doll talked I'm even more excited
because again all those reward points
system freaking racks are $14 lashes so
they are pretty pricey but it says right
here in the box up to 3
where's I'm telling you guys you can get
more get more out of it just clean your
lashes that you can get so many uses out
of these one of my favorite styles this
is in diva it is actually what I have on
my eyes today I also love bombshell
flirt is one of my favorite styles and
also trend setter I think they have six
different styles in general but I think
I only have three right now hold on I
haven't pulled up so bombshell diva and
socialite those are the styles that are
available at Ulta right now I'm not sure
if the other three are coming socialite
wasn't my favorite for me they just
weren't like my vibes when it comes to
false eyelashes I have very like
specific false eyelashes that I enjoy a
bombshell and diba those are available
also I would highly recommend them if
you like more like funky lashes and
maybe check out the socialite ones but
really if you love wearing false lashes
if you're just if you're a false eyelash
girl you got to add these to your cart
today we're gonna end it with a couple
of different concealers I have one
drugstore in one high end to recommend
for your alpha cards the first one which
is drugstore is the maybelline instant
age rewind this bad boy right here I
have been buying and buying and
rewriting for so many years it is one of
my absolute favorite concealers this is
what it looks like you can see that
already you know this one this one we're
about to say goodbye to and I'm gonna
repurchase it because this has to be in
my collection this is one of the first
like real concealers that I ever started
buying and I just hit the jackpot with
it for sure I've definitely repurchase
this over and over and over again this
is what the applicator looks like so
it's really different it's like kind of
like soft and squishy but truly this is
amazing for covering dark circles to be
honest I don't struggle with the dark
circles like I know some people struggle
with that on kind of a daily basis I
would highly recommend this and even if
you're someone who you only get them on
nights where you've had a really crummy
sleep like I did last night and you need
some help then you got to go with the
Maybelline instant age rewind because it
covers up the dark circles so well I
mean that I typically buy is fair
because then it's also really really
light on my eyes because I kind of like
the lighter concealers to really
brighten up my under eyes at the same
time this is about eight dollars between
eight and nine dollars typically I see
it at Ulta Maybelline is typically
always running some sort
deal not only at Ulta but you know
Walgreens and CVS I see you know the
different sales over there too so we're
looking to find a fabulous new concealer
that is also drugstore and you haven't
for some reason tried out the instant
age rewind then you got a do it to end
with a high-end concealer that I would
recommend this is the Tarte shape tape
now I know some of you might be thinking
that tart is also sold at Sephora and
that is a very correct but if you did
not know shape tape is an Ulta exclusive
so you will not find shape tape at
Sephora bird I noticed has a lot of
Sephora exclusive and Ulta exclusive
products and shave tape happens to be an
Ulta exclusive product so I wanted to
edit in here because this is one of my
all-time favorite concealers everybody
lost their minds one shape tape was
released and I was right there I was
right there losing my mind with them
because I love this concealer my shade
that I typically get as in light/medium
this is a full coverage concealer and
like I said I don't have super last
night I had to pull out the shape tape
like full coverage but it is also very
light on the skin
I have tried concealers that are full
coverage but are very very heavy very
cakey on the under eyes like the under
eyes it's kind of a last area where you
want anything really heavy because that
is such a thin skin on your face you
need something that is thin but you also
need something that is full coverage
that is the shape tape it blends out so
well I do not have any problems with
creasing with this definitely one of my
favorites it is $25 so that is expensive
for a concealer I have had this one for
quite some time and I can tell that I'm
starting to get down there I'm gonna
have to add it to my car because I can't
be without my shape tape and I think
that you should do I guess what I was
gonna be into for the tenant products
that I would recommend for your altar
cart I was gonna wait and post this
video next week since the altar 21 days
of beauty is going on right now but then
I thought in case there's any of the
Beauty seals or the Hot Buys that you
want to buy for this week but maybe you
need just you know a few extra dollars
for free shipping or if you're gonna be
making a long drive into Alta and you
don't want to drive for just one product
I thought I could get it out before this
week the sale does end Saturday at the
23rd in case you needed any extra
recommendations during the Ulta 21 days
a beauty event I do have a full
recommendations video as well I will
also have that one a link down below
people hope that you guys found this
video helpful let me know some of your
favorite products that you always pick
