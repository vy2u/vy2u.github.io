video is going to be about ten
underwhelming makeup products to me if
you caught yesterday's video I did 10
under a tit makeup products or makeup
products that I really enjoy and think
deserved more hype and today we're gonna
do the flipside we're gonna do products
that I find to be a little bit on the
underwhelming side maybe I do think that
these I get a lot of hype out there or
that's why I purchased them or had my
eye on them and I was just a little bit
let down like I still enjoyed these but
they didn't quite meet those
expectations that maybe I had so if you
want to see ten underwhelming makeup
products in my opinion why don't we go
ahead and get started it's always like I
said with the yesterday's video these
videos are all personal preference so
these are just my opinions and also of
course when it comes to underwhelming
makeup products I'm again not saying
that everybody absolutely loves all of
these products but just in general I
feel like I hear really good things
about these and for me they just kind of
slightly missed the mark a lot of these
I still really do like they just didn't
quite give me that like mmm that I feel
like so many other people might have but
jumping into it the first one that I
have here is a highlight and new spike I
have a lot of highlights in here I'm not
sure what what was going on but get
ready for some highlights but the first
highlight that I want to talk about is
this one from Maybelline and this is the
master chroma by face studio op metallic
highlighter and it is in molten gold I
have been watching so many best of 2017
videos and I feel like every other video
practically has this highlight in here
and I'm like what what am I missing
I know I used this in a first
impressions video and I was like okay
yes good and stuff but I didn't quite
mmm feel that pull right away that I was
maybe expecting to get and like I said
it's still a really nice highlight and I
feel like it swatches really really
beautifully I really do like look at
that I feel like it swatches so nice but
for some reason it doesn't seem to
translate on to my face the way that I
wanted to in the swatch and I've tried
different brushes with it from fluffier
brushes to more dense brushes I feel
like I still just can't quite get that
level of excitement that I'm seeing so
many other people have which is such a
bummer to me Maybelline did send this
one to me and I was very excited about
it because like I said I've been seeing
a lot of hype it had been in my Ulta
cart for a very long time so to be able
to get this I was so so excited about it
so when it kind of missed that mark for
me I was like but yes this Maybelline
master chrome again I saw this mentioned
so many times in best of videos but I
like it I just can't say that I love it
and then a foundation here that I have
this is from makeup forever and this is
their Ultra HD foundation this to me is
one that I kind of consider a cult
favorite and I've still been wanting to
do a video on like trying out cult
favorite makeup products and just kind
of giving my reviews on them
I've been purchasing them this one was
actually in my Sephora loves us for a
very long time I did get this one it
sent to me actually from Influenster and
then also make up forevers did send me a
PR package so I do have two different
shades of this which is super I was so
glad because like I said it had been on
my Sephora loves list I wanted to buy it
I wanted to try it out I feel like from
like when I first started watching
YouTube videos this and then also the
Make Up For Ever stick foundation I feel
like I hear a lot about those and I tend
to lean towards these more regular
liquid foundations versus the stick so
that's why I have this one on my love
list so super excited super grateful to
be able to try it out and again I like
this foundation I enjoy it I I wear it
every once in a while and when I first
got it I was like yes this foundation is
great I'm going to love this one I know
it like I have that kind of like feeling
right away like we're gonna get along
and we're going to be best friends but
kind of how I gauge what my favorites
are is what am I consistently reaching
for what are you constantly seeing in my
description box down below cuz I always
link all of my makeup
well foundations are you always seeing
there when I post an Instagram photo and
I list my makeup what are you like oh my
gosh she's wearing that foundation again
even though I have a lot of foundations
I definitely have my favorites that I am
constantly reaching for and then I also
think about what do I travel with what
am I going out of town with and I'm like
I have to have this foundation come with
me and I can't say that about this
foundation this one has never come
travelling with me and I've had this
foundation since the summer time I
believe it has never come traveling with
me and when I'm looking over my
foundations I am NOT often reaching for
this one there's like five six seven
other foundations that I would put
before this one so that's how I know
it's not a favorite of mine so that to
me was a little bit
on the underwhelming side not only
because I hear a lot of people talk it
up I see a lot of hype about it you know
I considered it a cult favorite but I
think maybe I was a little bit
underwhelmed because I was so excited to
get this one because it had been on my
loves list for so long so being able to
get it and try it out I was like yes
score this is awesome I'm gonna love
this one and so when I did it I was kind
of like no why
so the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation I still enjoy it I still wear
it I still reach for it it's just a
little bit on the underwhelming side to
me the next one I have I know it's
probably gonna surprise a lot of people
and this one is another highlighter this
is from a wet and wild and it's one of
the mega glow highlighting powders I
bought this one because I hear everybody
talk about the wet and wild highlighters
again I feel like I saw this mentioned a
bit in the best of videos but I
definitely think I saw the Maybelline
one at least of course in the videos
that I'm watching I think I saw the
Maybelline one recommend it more in that
video did buy this because I heard so
much hype about it I purchased it from
Ulta and it's really affordable it's
like four or five dollars or something
like that and I remember purchasing from
Ulta and I had some sort of discount
going on or extra points or something so
I mean it was totally it to me it was
worth it because I still do enjoy this
highlight and especially for such an
affordable price like I'm not mad at it
but I don't feel that level of love that
I feel like so many other people have
with this one and I'm like why I just
want to love you I picked up my shade in
a precious petals and there is a swatch
here of that one and this one I don't
feel like swatch is great so I have the
precious petal swatch right there I
don't feel like it swatches to the level
of the maybelline one but I actually
would say that I like this on my face a
little bit more than the maybelline one
so with almost every single product I'm
talking about
I still like these I just don't
necessarily love them type of thing and
with this one just seeing how many
people are recommending it and seeing
how many people have liked have
purchased all of the different
highlights in this collection I was like
okay I'm gonna start with precious
petals and then I'm gonna purchase this
one and I'm gonna purchase that one and
I'm just gonna like try to collect
basically all of the wet and wild
highlights and I have not purchased
another one because there's just other
highlights that I enjoy more and while I
still like this one I just don't feel
that pull to go out and grab another
shade so this is one that I know
I feel like a lot of people really do
like this but unfortunately I just
couldn't quite pull them up with it
next time I have another eyeshadow
palette here and this is one that I wish
I wish is so hard I would have like
fallen head over heels in love with and
again I like this one but not to the
level that I think I was expecting to
fall in love with it this is from dose
of colors and it's the collaboration
with desi Perkins and Katie or lustre
lux and it is their eyeshadow quad in it
is called the girls and then these shape
names are all named after their four
dogs which I always thought was super
cute so this is what the inside looks
like and I mean you can tell that I have
used it and I do enjoy this palette but
I was really expecting this to just
become an absolute number one favorite
like I was going to be shouting from my
roof how much I absolutely adore this
palette I love desi and Katy they are
two of my favorite big-time influencers
I love how real they keep it I love
their friendship and how much they do to
promote other women especially you know
each other but other influencers as well
I think they are really some of the best
out there in my opinion of course and I
also love dose of colors as a brand
I love the dose of colors I shadow
palette I have the staff CC on this
palette on my eyes today love them so
when I start seeing their snapchats of
this and using it on their eyes I was
like I am going to absolutely adore this
palette and I don't love it as much as I
had hoped
I was going to I enjoy that we get them
here and there I like the packaging and
you know I think this kind of shiny bit
is super cute and the shades are
interesting but they're hard to work
with I'm fairly sure I mentioned this in
a high maintenance makeup products video
I'll leave that one link down below I
did that quite a while ago but this
definitely is a high maintenance palette
you really need to use setting sprays
with almost all of the shades in here
they're better applied with your fingers
versus a brush and I am someone who
personally does not enjoy putting my
fingers and makeup like I have swatches
right now my fingers and it's driving me
absolutely and saying I just want to
wipe them off so bad
so having to apply makeup with my
fingers it's not my personal favorite
to do and so for that reason it makes it
a little bit challenging but I do like
the palette and even we were traveling
one time we were going out of town to
Iowa City and I was kind of deciding we
were having like a girls night all
weekend a girls weekend I guess then you
would say we were having a girls weekend
both those nights and I was like you
know what's kind of fun what's kind of
different that I could do with my eyelid
I was like oh yeah I'll grab this one
and I ended up using I think this shade
the first night and this shade the
second night because they are fun and
unique it just I know it's gonna take me
a little bit longer and I just didn't
quite fall in love with it as hard as I
had hoped to again I still enjoy it I'm
not sure if this is still available
because it was a collaboration it is
limited edition if it is still available
I will have it linked down below but I
didn't return it I didn't you know put
it on my Poshmark or anything like that
I still do want to keep it partly
because I still do want to support does
a Katy and dose of colors but also
because I don't reach for it every now
and again and get a good makeup look out
of it but just not an absolute favorite
of mine and then another product I want
to talk about here is from Kevin o Kwan
again it's another highlighter I don't I
don't know why I highlights like I'm
dominating this video it was kind of
strange to me but this is the needle
highlighter in it Sahara and it is a
golden rose glow this is one that when I
saw Kevin upon coming out with these I
was so excited about it I wanted them
I'm pretty sure I put it in a will I
bite video almost like I'm so attracted
to these and I really do want to get
them but they are more pricey coming to
Kwan is a very pricy brand and I want to
see these are like at the 50 dollar
range maybe $58 for one highlight and I
was like I just feel like that's too
expensive even though all of these
highlights kind of have like an ombre
effect so you can do a darker highlight
over here you can fade to a lighter
highlight I typically mix this one all
together and that is my preference like
I said I think this is a pretty
highlight I was just wearing it in a
video the other day I think it's pretty
but it's not anything that like super
overwhelms me which is why it's in the
under whelming video Samantha it's not
something that overwhelms me or that I'm
like everybody needs this highlight and
I guess I just thought for Kevyn Aucoin
who's most of the products
that brand knock it out of the park for
me I enjoy so many products from cabinet
Quan and this one just kind of fell
short for me I also think that these are
very powdery highlights like when I dip
my brush in there it really kicks up a
lot so I'm constantly trying to like
blow off the palate it looks nice on the
skin but it's just not especially for my
type of highlight Li like more
highlights with and to them for my
cheekbones and this one kind of gives
that what did it what did it say it was
called golden rose glow it kind of gives
like a soft rose glow is what I would
say so I think I was expecting for the
brand and for the price I think I was
expecting a lot more but this one just
was kind of underwhelming and I think
that Kevin Daquan has better highlights
out there so not necessarily able to
like fully recommend these again I still
enjoy it and I'll still reach for it but
mmm just not the the best especially
from that brand I said I have another
eyeshadow palette here to talk about
this is from mac cosmetics and this is
the fashion fanatic palette I think this
one was underwhelming to me because this
was the first time I was ever trying out
Mac eyeshadows and I have heard
relatively really good things about Mac
eyeshadows eyeshadow palettes I see Mac
shadows being used a lot in tutorials
and this was from when I first started
watching YouTube videos I always had it
on my list to purchase Mac eyeshadows
because I would see them so much so this
was the first time I was trying out
their shadows I did get this one sent to
me in PR as well and I was so excited
about it and I like I couldn't wait and
I use this like immediately it was like
I have to use this I'm just so excited
about it and again I think it's okay but
it wasn't anything that necessarily blew
me away and I was like wait what and so
I did another look with it and I was
like still just okay and I remember the
month that I got this one I did feature
it in my makeup monthly and I put it in
the fine category because I said and you
know it's not a complete fail I don't
think all of the shadows are duds but it
just didn't quite excite me to the level
that I thought it was going to excite me
so Mac came out with a bunch of these
different types of palettes I got sent
the fashion fanatics so you have a bunch
of different eyeshadows in here and then
you also got a highlight shade and again
the highlight shade to me was just okay
there wasn't really anything
about this palette that really made me
like jump up and gasp and you know want
to tell everybody to go ahead and buy it
I just thought it was decent I thought
it was good I will say that I recently
also received the Macan Patrick Starr
collection in PR I'm working on a review
for that I've been trying out all the
different products that was sent to me
and my reviews will be coming soon for
that and I will say that I was more
excited about those and Mac shadows in
there and then I was in here so I don't
know if maybe just for some reason these
pallets were a little bit different
formula wise because I definitely like
the Mac Patrick story eyeshadows much
better but this one to me just a little
bit underwhelming
I think maybe this is gonna be the last
highlight I'm talking about maybe next
appear I have a highlight palette and
this is from Urban Decay and it's the
afterglow highlight palette I recently
mentioned this one I believe it was in
my Black Friday follow-up video because
I did purchase this around at Black
Friday time and you know if you've been
watching my channel I fell in love with
the Urban Decay sin highlight this year
absolutely loved it I've been raving
about it forever and so when an urban
decay releases new highlight palette I
purchased it right away and I was very
excited about it when I mentioned it in
my follow-up video I did say it don't
sale right now for like $19 hopefully
it's still on sale when this video goes
up I will have it linked down below of
course and I said for $19 like I would
have been very excited about this
palette and been like yes you should go
ahead and buy this but for the $34 I
just thought it was decent and I think
for this one had me a little bit
underwhelmed because I had such high
expectations from the sin highlight that
I was like I'm gonna love every single
shade I'm just like this is gonna be
become my new go-to a highlight palette
that I absolutely like must bring with
me constantly reaching for it and I
don't reach for it that much I do still
enjoy it I like it and especially cliche
and no angel I really enjoy those shades
and I think that they are very pretty
but as a whole I just kind of felt a
little bit underwhelmed by this one and
maybe that's my fault like do you guys
ever do that where you build something
up so high in your mind and then you get
it you're like ooh is it falling short
because I had too high of expectations
cuz I feel like maybe that's what
happened with this guy again I do still
like it I'm not going to get rid of it
or anything like that I didn't return it
or anything I would just recommend
getting it on sale
you can if it's still on sale but it's
still a nice highlight palette it just
we didn't click to the level I thought
we were going to click if you know what
I'm saying next up I don't have any
products to show in particular but this
is just kind of a brand in general that
I've come to realize just really doesn't
do anything for me
it's a skincare brand and that is Sunday
Riley I feel like Sunday Riley
definitely gets a lot of hype out there
a lot of people use their products and
talk about their products it's also a
very expensive like luxury high-end
skincare brand for that reason I've
always been afraid to purchase a full
size product just because if it doesn't
work for me I'm going to be out a lot of
money so that kind of always held me
back from purchasing a full sized
products but I have used like 100-point
perks at Sephora I've also gotten
samples and things like that because I
really did want to try out the brain and
figure out what is it that works for me
what is it that excites me and truly I
can't really find anything from the
brand that I'm like yes this is my go-to
I love this one oh my gosh I finished
the sample either need another sample I
need the full size right away and
especially for the Sunday Riley price
point I just I cannot get on board with
that and I've just been really surprised
just you know how much I hear about them
and I've been watching the bus of
skincare videos as well a lot of people
are mentioning items in there from
Sunday Riley and products that I have
tried in samples and I'm like this does
nothing for me I think in my most recent
empties video which was a live chat I
mentioned they're like mattifying
Martian lotion some sort of face cream I
was like a little green bottle again it
was a 100-point perk and I'm like I just
really didn't feel anything I felt
nothing about it I didn't see it doing
anything right now I just finished up
fairly recently their CEO cream I think
it was called and I enjoyed the smell of
it but other than that didn't really
like it didn't really do anything for me
I didn't feel a pull to go out there and
purchase a full-size or even get another
sample like I think I'm gonna stop
spending my 100-point perks on the
Sunday Riley samples because it's just
not doing anything for me
I think of brands like la Hendrickson
who I purchased a set of samples from
them from the Sephora website and it's
gone on like Lula Hendrickson has become
one of my favorite skincare brands going
on to purchase
from Willa Hendrickson because of those
samples I recently started trying drunk
elephant who drunk elephant Sunday Riley
we're always kind of like on my list
together because they both are high-end
I recently started trying drunk elephant
products and there's a lot of them that
have been like okay yes I've recently
mentioned their luxury facial oil in my
makeup monthly in my favorites for the
month of December so I don't know what
it is Sunday Riley have you guys tried
them do you have any standout products
from them are you like me you just you
can't figure out what all the hype is
about
so that's kind of how I feel the next
product I have here is another eyeshadow
palette I think this might surprise some
people and again I'm not saying that I
dislike this palette or I'm gonna return
it or you know pass it along or anything
like that but I wasn't quite as excited
about it as I thought I might be and
this is the dream Street palette from
Kathleen lights and color pop I know I
know I did recently review this one I
believe yes in my bath Friday haul
follow-up video I did review this one
and I said that you know I enjoy it and
I can make a lot of pretty looks out of
it and for I think this one was sixteen
dollars that's not a bad price at all
and as a whole I do like the palette but
there are a few disappointing shades in
here for me
shapes that just as simply don't show up
at all
on my eyes and I think once I started
playing with it more I started to
realize that yes I can create pretty
looks with this but I feel like I'm kind
of limited in the palette we have at
these two shades which are fairly
similar to one another and then you also
have like the to kind of like teal blue
shades that I'm like I don't know like
maybe if there'd been just one or two
different like shade ranges in here I
think maybe I could have gotten more use
out of it but I really like the color
pop rest I chose and I really like their
palettes I have a lot of them I bought a
lot of them and all that I did purchase
this one like I said in my Black Friday
haul so I still like this palette but
especially I think maybe too because I
did a first impressions with this and I
was like yes I am so freaking hyped for
this palette and then as I kept going
and as I kept playing with it I was like
maybe I'm not as hyped as I thought I
was going to be and I also purchased the
all I see as magic palette from
colour-pop just a couple weeks before
this one that came out is I didn't know
this one was coming out because
otherwise
I probably would have bought this one
over the all I see is magic but when
people ask me would you recommend dream
Street or all ICS magic I actually say
all I see is magic so that was kind of
another thing that let me know that
maybe this one was a little bit on the
more underwhelming side for me again I
still like it I would still recommend it
for the sixteen dollars and I'm still
gonna play with it and create licks from
it I just think of me as hyped as I
thought it was going to and the last one
I have here is another eyeshadow palette
and this is from a tart this is the
tartlet toasted eyeshadow palette this
was one that I was so excited about I
put it in a will I buy a video and I was
like yes I can't wait I'm gonna purchase
this one right away I'm so excited for
this palette and I got it and I was like
yes I love you let's do this let's go
and the first couple looks at create it
with it I was like yep all good here
like this is great and then I was like
oh I think I created all the looks that
I can create it kind of reminded me of
like a little bit similar to what I
thought about the Urban Decay Naked heat
palette like the colors are just a
little bit too monochromatic too close
to one another and I feel like I'm just
kind of creating the same looks over and
over again with this palette I do really
like the Tarte cosmetics formula of
their eyeshadows especially in their
these kind of palettes like the tartlet
and bloom I have as well and I really
enjoyed that palette so I decided to
keep it I kind of went back and forth
like should I keep it should I not keep
it it is 46 dollars but I did get it for
20% off at Ulta so there was that and I
still feel like I can create pretty
looks with it I just again I feel like
I'm kind of creating the same look and I
was really excited to for this crackle
shade like I was super stoked for it
because it looks to be like a deep brown
with a bunch of like gold glitter in it
I just thought I could make the most
beautiful fun I look but the glitter all
falls out all over your face and
disappears and you basically just have
another matte brown eyeshadow which you
already have those in here so I was a
little bit disappointed in that just
because I was so excited for this
palette like I said I wanted to purchase
it right away I couldn't wait to create
all these different fun looks with it
and I just feel like I'm kind of limited
similar to the dream to dream street
palette I just feel like I'm a little
bit limited in all of the different
looks that I can create like I said
still pretty I enjoy the formula and
these are nice
to travel with they have a mirror there
nice in compact like there they're easy
to throw into a travel bag but I just I
wasn't as hyped for this palette as I
was hoping I'd be so that is everything
for my 10 underwhelming makeup products
I hope that you enjoyed this video I'm
seeing some of the products that like I
said I still enjoy and I still liked a
lot of these products and I'm keeping
them around but I just didn't quite get
as hyped as maybe I see a lot of other
people being or as hyped as I thought I
personally would have been for these I'd
love to know if you have the same
experience with any of the products that
I mentioned or maybe what is the product
that you bought that you were super
hyped for and it quite hit it out of the
park like you were expecting it to or
that you were led to believe throughout
the YouTube hype and all of that I would
love to know so leave them and the
comments down below but other than that
that is going to do it for this video
and if you did enjoy it I hope that
you'll give it a thumbs up I hope that
you will also consider subscribing
before you go and I'll catch you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
