today's video is going to be an update
to my first update for my project pan
I'm doing the 18 and 20 18 a project pan
I'll leave my original video it listed
down below his that I was gonna do what
quarterly updates so today is going to
be my first update video and show you
guys how I'm doing on these 18 projects
that I chose to try to use up a
throughout the year of 2018 so if you'd
like to see my update to this project
pan why don't we go ahead and get
started already so like I said I'll have
my original project pan video listed
down below that I did around the first
of the year and one thing that I said in
the project pan video was that I didn't
want to put too much stress on myself
with this project pan I'm very new to
project panel this is only the aesthetic
project pan that I've ever done my first
one was a skin care and then I started
to do this one and I didn't want to put
a ton of pressure on myself like I must
finish these up you know that sort of
thing it was more just for me to see how
much of a product I can actually use up
with an within a year more like like a
research type of purposes for me just
something that I would know for myself
how long it takes me to get through this
you know this product that product that
sort of things so with that in mind I
will also say that I know that this is
only the first check-in and I felt this
way on my first check in with my skin
care project pan too but like I feel
like I'm doing terribly again I know a
lot of people are saying like what the
first check-in like don't be too
stressed and it gets easier throughout
you know the duration of your project
pan but I'm like I feel like I'm doing
really bad but I just there's always so
many new products coming out and
products that I want to be trying and
reviewing and I get requested for so
many different reviews that it's so hard
to like continually keep using the same
product and I also realize that like I
get kind of bored when I just keep using
the same products over and over again
and then I kind of switch to something
else and then I kind of forget about a
different product so I don't know we'll
see how the year goes but before my
first project pan update I have this a
foundation here from Tarte that this is
the rainforest of the sea water
foundation so I had gone through after
the original project pan video and
marked everything so you can see this
first line is where I started and the
second
is where I am now so obviously not not a
huge difference there but I will say
that this is a commendation that I
prefer wearing more in the warmer months
again I feel like shade matches better
for me in the warmer months but also I
just that's when I tend to gravitate for
it so we'll see how I do with this one
especially more towards like
spring/summer I was using it for a while
like right after my project pan but
again I just kind of got bored Turk did
some weird things and I don't know I
just kind of stopped using the products
on camera and things like that but I do
have quite a bit of chart in this
project fan video but I also had grabbed
out the Tarte rainforest of the sea
apple concealer so again same thing here
that mark is really light but there was
my original mark and then my second mark
so not a huge difference here but with
this one I was using it fairly
consistently and I thought that it was
drying out my under eyes and I wasn't
really happy with that so I don't know I
felt like if I use this on a very
consistent basis like several days in a
row that it dries out my under eyes so
that's when I kind of like backed off it
and I would prefer to just use this
sparingly so that was something that I
noticed about the aqua concealer a lot
of times I don't wear it like the same
concealer back-to-back-to-back-to-back
so I'd never really noticed that about
the aqua concealer but it was something
I noticed when I did start wearing it
very consistently a primer that I had in
the project pan is this one from number
7 it's the airbrush away primer again I
did the markings over here as you can
see the original to this one and it's
kind of hard with a squeezed soup to
kind of tell like I kind of sat here for
a while like
where do I feel like weight-wise where
would it be this is one that I honestly
forgot was in the project pan I just I
just forgot I remember again using it
quite a bit right after that video and
then I just got some new primers I've
been really loving the flower Beauty
primers I've been way living the
Smashbox primer Iser and I just kind of
like forgot about this guy when I was
going through my list and pulling out
items I was like oh yeah I could put the
number-7 primer in there I really do
like this primer though I made sure to
use it today and I'll pull it back out
to the front of my drawer so I remember
to keep using it but yeah I haven't made
a ton of progress there but this one
here this is the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer I know I see a lot of
people put this in their project pans as
well I wanted to put it in my part
a lot of people say it's really hard to
pan this guy and this is what it looks
like I will go ahead and insert a photo
so you can see where I started but I
don't really feel like I've made a huge
difference with this one I feel like I'm
starting you know to kind of wear away
at the pattern there but man this thing
is hard and I wear this one a lot like
this is one of those things where like
I'm bored
wearing the butter bronzer and fun fact
about me I can't spell physicians to
save my life because I'm always writing
physicians formula butter bronzer like
in my description box because I'll ink
on my makeup when I post make a photo on
Instagram I can't spell physicians I
always spell it wrong hello so that's
really fun but I do feel like I used
this quite a bit I took it on my
vacation with me this was like the only
bronzer that I used on my Arizona
vacation so I'm like I have like I can
kind of see you like a little little
dent in there but I don't know we'll see
also the like clasp on it broke so now
it just does that so that's not very fun
okay continuing on I grabbed out these
two eyeshadows from colour-pop when I
was filming my project pan video I had
recently filmed my what was it it was it
was a flashback video like flashback to
my 2016 beauty favorites or something
like that and I had mentioned these in
here so they were kind of like on the
top of my head when I was putting
together the items for this project pan
and I wanted to include these because I
used to wear these so much these are the
colour-pop super shock shadows in truth
and also in la la I used to wear this
color combination so often on my eyes
and I was like you know what it can be
fun to pull them back out I didn't want
to do any eye shadow palettes because
action of palettes would be so
extraordinarily impossible for me to do
a project pan on I really do want to
start a serious like Andrea Mattel
y'know does where she refused like new
eyeshadow releases I really want to
start something like that cuz I love
those videos of hers and so like I
actually have like a list and his
schedule and tally marks of how often
I'm using eyeshadows because I really
want to start that series there's just
no way I would be able to do this for
eyeshadows but I grabbed these little
single guys and then I use them one too
that was it I used them once after that
project pan video and that was it so
that was really awesome this one right
here is truth and I love this shade I
think it's so beautiful and then this
one here is la la and it's a really cool
rose gold it kind of has like that
foiled vibe to it but I really loved
these eyeshadows at one point and I
really like what I think my mistake was
was that after I used them I put them
back in a drawer and I think that I need
to have all not pulled out like I need
to have them in my line of sight so I
remember and also I was really bummed
because this would have been a really
good thing to bring on my Arizona
vacation with me especially because it's
such a simple I look and one that I just
like I I used to do so often so it's
super easy for me to recreate so I wish
I would have brought these on vacation
with me but I will pull these out so I
remember to keep using them because I
really do think I even said it in my
original video I think that these
colour-pop super shock shadows are easy
to hit pan on because I've done it for
several of them I don't feel like you
get a ton of product in these which is
probably whether super cheap but yeah
I'll be working on these one product
though that I did finish up which was
pretty exciting was the brow pencil that
I chose this one is from thrive
cosmetics it's their infinity waterproof
eyebrow liner and I have Audrey so I did
finish this one up probably just a
couple weeks ago so it wasn't super
quick but I still was able to to get it
finished up which I thought was pretty
good I really do like this brow pencil
yeah it's completely gone but I really
do like this brow pencil I like the
shade of it I liked how easy it was kind
of reminded me of the benefit precisely
my brow but yeah I finished that one up
so it's pretty proud of myself there I
also put in here the Lancome Hypnose
drama mascara this was a mascara that I
hadn't opened at the time that I was
doing my project pan and I said that I
kind of wanted to motivate myself to get
through some of my mascaras one thing
that I do a lot is I stop using products
when I'm about to run out of them and
I've mentioned that in my skincare
project pan and I think I mentioned that
in my original video as well and it's so
funny how many other people tell me that
they are just like me when it comes to
that it's like if you find something you
really like but then you're almost out
of it it's like like um
like I do it with makeup I also do it
with like food it's like the weirdest
thing ever I don't I don't know what
that's about but that's what I do and so
I have so many mascaras that are like
only have a couple uses left and I was
like get through some of those mascaras
then you can open that this Lancome
Hypnose drama because I really enjoyed
this one I had many of it originally
that came in like mascara set and I went
out and purchased the whole size of it
because I really do like the mascara so
I was like it definitely need to get
through some of those and I was really
happy it was just about last week I
ended up getting rid of like two or
three different mascaras so I was like
you can open the Lancome Hypnose drama
your shelf life can start and you can
see how long it takes you to use up a
mascara so I've only used this now
probably about five times I did take it
with me on my Arizona vacation I used it
like just before we left and I was like
yes I love this mascara so I took it
with me on my Arizona vacation and held
up really well and the heat and
everything but yeah I've only used it
about five times but it's officially
opened and the countdown is on the timer
starts with mascaras because they go bad
so quickly I also have a Tarte blush
this is a little mini blush in a partay
one of the Amazonian clay 12-hour
blushes I got this as a birthday gift
from a Sephora so here is what it looks
like now I feel like there's probably
not a huge difference between the photo
that I took the original time it's
really hot like I feel like it's so hard
to even get like the pattern to kind of
wear away and I know a lot of people are
saying that you know you have a lot of
the mini tart blushes as well and it's
really hard to get through them or even
hit pan on them or anything but I mean I
will definitely keep trying I thought
about bringing some of the Tarte mini
blushes on my Arizona vacation with me
because I have another one as well and
knowing that this one was in my project
pan I was like could be a good time to
use it up but I ended up bringing a
blush palette instead I do have a video
on what I did take with me to Arizona I
think it went up the day before this
video I'll have it linked down below in
case you want to see what makeup and
skincare I chose to bring with me on my
vacation but I ended up keeping this one
behind but yeah we'll see how I do a
highlight that I put in my project pan
is from the balm this is mary lou
manizer my OG highlight my very first
highlight that i ever purchased I do
have Mary Lu on my cheeks today I've
been wearing her quite a bit luckily I
can spell the balm and Mary Lumina
they're silk that's okay this really is
a fantastic highlight though like it's
so easy to apply and you need such a
little product but it also means that
it's really really hard to pan so this
is what my mary-lou manizer looks like
obviously there's no pan to it like I
can see the dent I can see the dent in
it like right there in the middle I feel
like pans gotta be coming you know like
14 months or something but I mean I will
see how I do we'll see how I do I do
reach for her quite a bit and I just I
just enjoy it I just like this highlight
it's one that like never lets me down
though we will see how I do with this
one this one I have high hopes for I
really do I do have high hopes for
Marilyn moving on and to the lip
products and that I chose so I'm already
having a rough day if you've noticed
that like my mood isn't that great I'm
still sick which is frustrating I got
sick before I left for vacation so I'm
still dealing with sickness but I don't
know you know you know getting back from
vacation especially being gone for so
many days like just trying to get back
into the swing of things
I'm just having a rough day I tried to
do my makeup for an Instagram tutorial
and it just didn't it just I don't know
I did the same makeup like in Arizona
day after day after day and it's like
now I tried to come back and do
something different and it just it was
horrible I ended up having to wipe off
all of my makeup and just start over
again so I'm just having like one of
those days where things aren't going
right and then I was pulling out
products for this video and I cannot
find my Mac age sex location my nude
lipstick from Mac and I am for us trying
it right now and I did too like pretty
in-depth searches of my office I've
looked at my purse I've looked in my
clutch I went upstairs into my bathroom
just to look for it like I can't find
this lipstick anywhere so I'm very I'm
very angry about that cuz that's one of
my absolute favorite lipsticks I did not
take it with me on my Arizona vacation
because I was afraid I was going to lose
it so I don't know I don't know where it
is and one thing that I've done I've
done this now this will be the third
time that I've done it with this
particular lipstick because all my MAC
lipsticks look the same I keep them in
their own little drawer but every time I
go to reach in there I'm typically
reaching for age sex location and I have
to spend so much time searching you know
I mean it takes me
ten seconds but in my mind that's too
long but I have to keep searching for
them because it's not like easily like
oh that's that's the one so I keep
putting it in different spots so I can
easily find it but then I can't remember
this spot that I've put it in I do this
all the time it's absolutely ridiculous
but I keep putting it in a different
spot and then when I finally find it I'm
like okay well that spot didn't work out
so next time I want to put it a
different spot and then I can't remember
that spot either so I know I put it in a
spot somewhere that I could easily find
it so that's neat maybe I'll find it
before this video goes up so I can at
least like insert a photo of what it
looks like compared to the first time
but uh know where it said it's just one
of those days one of those days another
lipstick and that was in my project pan
is this a little mini from a Kat Von D
this is in Ludwig I love this liquid
lipstick
I feel like liquid lipsticks are kind of
hard to kind of gauge how much I have
left but I feel like I'm doing really
good on this one I take this one out and
Mike let's just be quite a bit if I'm
going on like a night out I did take
this to Arizona with me and this was my
most used lipstick in Arizona so I feel
like I'm doing a pretty a pretty good
job with a Kat Von D a Ludwig and then I
also have in here from Maybelline that
this is a truffle tease this is one of
my favorite lipsticks let's just let my
maybelline truffle tease it looks like
all twisted up so I feel like I'm doing
a pretty good job with this one I also
brought this one to Arizona with me and
this was my most used like daytime
lipstick and then nighttime was the Kat
Von D so I feel like I did a pretty I
feel like I'm doing a pretty good job
with this one I feel like I'm on a good
track and then I also wanted to include
this one it from a glossier this is the
coconut bomb calm it's the universal
skin itself and I use it as a lip balm I
feel like you can tell that it's been
that it's been pressed in quite a bit
there's also some marks on it because
areas thought she would help me with the
project pan my dog got a hold of it one
day I was like no no that woman she
didn't actually like break into it or
anything like that they're just just a
little teeth marks on it but yeah I feel
like I'm doing pretty good on that one
too so all of my lip products I feel
like I'm doing well at and apparently
age sex location I'm doing doing so well
at hiding from
so who else was a ridiculous okay I
almost finished I just have four
products left so I included my Mac at
fix+ in here this was one that I said in
my original video that it was kind of
that thing where like I was starting to
get down on it and then I didn't want to
run out of this because this is like one
of my favorite setting sprays I use it
so much I was almost out of it I was
like no I can't run out so it's just
using my other setting sprays but I have
a backup so I'm like girlfriend you you
can get rid of this one it will be okay
so if you can see let's see this is
where I started that little line there
and I'm now here so I think that's
pretty good
I use this quite a bit because one of
those things were like I feel like I'm
powdery or like my makeup is just not
like sitting the bus I just like douse
myself and fix+ and I feel like a looks
so much better so I really enjoyed this
one so I feel like I'm on a pretty good
try I feel like I'll finish that one up
pretty quickly and then the last makeup
product that I had was the Maybelline
better skin superstay better skin skin
transforming powder so this is a face
powder so this is what it looks like so
no dents no anything so far no hitting
of the pan I brought this one to Arizona
with me I used it quite a bit down there
but yeah I feel like this one to me is
just crazy that I haven't I'm very light
handed with my makeup and I made sure to
say that in my original video too so
it's really really difficult for me to
go through something and to even hit
paint on something but this is one that
I've had for a while and I use it quite
a bit so I'm just I'm surprised at that
one and then I did put in two skincare
products as well so I included the pixie
peel and polish I really do like Pixies
a skincare so you can see the line here
and then the line here I started using
this one on a pretty consistent basis
it's I do have sensitive skin and it's a
little bit it's it's a little gritty
it's a little much for my skin so I
really only like to use it once like
maybe twice a week but I've been pretty
consistent using it at least once a week
I'll do my drunk elephant like baby
facial on Mondays and then I typically
use this one on like Thursday or Friday
so I'm not using it too close together
because my sensitive skin would probably
hate that but I feel like I've gotten
into a pretty good team good routine
recently with this one so I feel like
I'll be on a good truck and then the
other one that I have here is the
Dermalogica
accident Hydra missed this one I'm not
doing so well on so there's the first
mark if you can see that faint little
line there is my second mark so not
doing the best on this one and again I
think it's because it's underneath my
sink in a drawer I need to like pull it
out to the top but this is something I
did say in my original video I don't use
this every single day I still think that
I will be able to finish it up by the
time the project pan ends but we'll see
hopefully I'll get a little bit farther
for my next check-in but after that that
is my progress on these 18 products okay
so that is everything for my first
project pan update for my 18 and 2018
project pan again I don't feel like I'm
doing super well so far but I'm trying
to remember when everyone is fed like
don't freak out by your first check-in
and it'll get better and this just kind
of like remote evades me and you know
now I've pulled out all these products
so I'll be using them quite a bit so
those are my updates I would love to
know how are you guys doing with your
project pan I've been having a lot of
fun watching everybody's updates videos
are starting to roll in so I've been
watching all of them and seeing how
everyone's doing so let me know if you
guys are doing a project pan - I would
love to know your progress but other
than that that's going to do it for
today's video
if you guys didn't enjoy it I hope that
you'll give that a thumbs up I hope that
you'll also consider subscribing before
you go and I'll catch you guys in at
tomorrow's video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
