so excited for today's video because I'm
going to be sharing 18 projects that I
want to use up in 2018 or a 2018 project
pan video I really had no plans to do
this video until I started seeing a
bunch of people start to post theirs and
I was like man that just sounds so
intriguing should I do that and I said
something on my snapchat a lot of people
said they would like to see it so I went
through and chose 18 products from my
makeup collection also I have two
skincare items in here but sixteen
makeup products that I want to try to
use up or hip pant on in the year of
2018 I'm really excited to be doing this
but if you would like to see the 18
products that I chose why don't we go
ahead and get started all right so I am
NOT what I would consider a project
panner I know there's the project pan
community here on YouTube and they do
really cool things and I've kind of been
slowly watching more videos and getting
more into it myself I tried out my first
project pan starting it was back in
November with my friend Lisa Stevens we
are currently doing a skincare project
pan I like my videos down below at how
please his channel down below as well
and we challenge herself to use up 10
different skincare items and honestly I
thought it was really kind of
challenging and stressful at first when
I did my one-month check-in I was like I
don't know if I'm gonna finish any of
these products like this is way harder
than I thought and then the second month
like a lot of people encouraged me which
was really nice and said you know
usually the first month is like
typically the hardest especially when
you're only doing a couple months at a
time for a project pan but they kept
encouraging me and it's actually turned
out to be pretty well so when I thought
okay I have an entire year to use these
products like that would be pretty cool
right but it's also just kind of worried
because especially being a youtuber you
know I buy a lot of makeup and I get
sent a lot of makeup and I'm trying a
lot of different makeup and I'm trying
to do reviews and things like that so I
was like is this even realistic for me
to do so I kind of said that I didn't
want to go into this project pan what
the mind set up I have to finish all
these 18 products have to finish them
off completely or hit pan them
completely or whatnot like yes it is a
goal but the big part like the main part
that I want to focus this project pan on
is simply to see how fast I use these
products up in a year I believe I'll do
like quarterly check-ins I think are
Andre might Ileana mention she was gonna
do quarterly check-ins and I thought
that that was a good idea but I think
it'll be interesting to see every
quarter and then at the beginning of
2019 you know just crazy to say to see
how well it actually did how realistic
is it to use a foundation to hit pan on
a highlight like I think that's what
will be the most interesting part so
that's what I kind of want to go into
like that's kind of what I want to take
out of this project Pam I guess that I
should say so I'm excited like I said I
chose about 18 different products so let
me show you what I got I also love to
know like when I said on my snapchat
that I've seen by doing this a lot of
people said that you wanted to do it as
well so I'd love to know if you are of
what products did you choose I think
it'd be really cool to kind of like do
together throughout the year as well so
I'm excited for this I'm glad that I
decided to do it I did want to choose a
foundation this is the Tarte rainforest
of the sea foundation I really do like
this foundation I have it on today I
just kind of had the bottle tilted over
on its side but typically when I stand
it up it actually is like there's a
pretty fair amount gone from this
foundation that's kind of starting to
settle I think it's like it's right here
I will go through and kind of like mark
everything with a pen so I can do you
know the quarterly updates and what now
I know I've had this one for a while and
I would like to see myself get through
it or get pretty down there with this
foundation and then I also have the
tarte rainforest of the sea concealer
and again it's probably like right
around here or so so I've used a good
chunk of this concealer and I really do
enjoy it so again I would like to see
how I go throughout the year and I do
like to use these two together so I
thought that that could be good for a
project man I don't know because I'm
very new to these so I don't know I kind
of like stress at one point like am i
choosing the right items am I not
choosing enough of this category or I
have too much of that category but you
know I just kind of had to like no one
knows your makeup collection as well as
you do and no one knows your microbots
as well as you do so you just got to do
you a primer that I chose is the number
seven airbrush away primer I chose this
mainly just because it's one of my
favorite primers and I reach for it a
lot so I feel like I would have a pretty
good chance going through it so that is
what I'm going to choose for my primer
and I feel like it works good with
really like any foundation like it's not
just mattifying it's not
just you know hydrating things like that
it's kind of like that in between South
us kind of why I chose that one I also
chose out a bronzer this is the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer I feel
like I see a lot of these in the project
pan videos that I've been watching but I
really want to hit pan on this one and
see how I do this is what it looks like
right now I haven't hit pan at all
anywhere in this which really surprises
me because I've had this bronzer for a
while and I really really enjoy it and I
especially reach for it a ton in the
winter months because it's a little bit
lighter so I reached for it when I paler
so I feel like I don't know curious to
see how I would do I also reached for
two eyeshadows I kind of went back and
forth on these but I really want to do
it I mentioned these color pop super
shock shadows in my flashback Friday to
my best of beauty 2016 video and I went
through all of my favorites from 2016
and I just said do I still enjoyed them
have I declared them etc and I was
talking about these at shadows in
particular because I love using truth
and Lala together and I think that they
are really beautiful and I used to use
these shadows all of the time it was
like one of my go-to looks and I kind of
got off the colour-pop super shock
shadows I was never really a huge fan of
them to begin with but I kind of went
off them and went more into my palettes
and things like that so these kind of
got tucked away but I want to bring them
back out and I do think that I would be
able to hit pan on both of these we have
truth over here and then Lala over here
I think that I would be able to hit pan
on these because it's really easy to hit
pan on the colour-pop super shock
shadows so I feel like I could do some
damage with these if I went back to it
but I mentioned in the in the flashback
Friday video I was like this kind of
makes me a little nostalgic for these
shadows because I remember how much I
loved them and how much I loved creating
you know kind of just my go-to rose gold
eye shadow look I thought it was so
pretty so you want to thought of this
project pan video I was like you know
what you know what I'm gonna pull those
back out bitch for a mascara this is the
Lancome Hypnose drama on this is a
full-size mascara I have a lot of mini
mascaras because I wear a false lashes
so much but this is a mascara that I
have it yet to open but I have used a
deluxe size sample of this so I know
that I really love the Hypnose star
because I wouldn't want to pull up
mascara that I've never used and I'm
like you have to finish it or you're
like that would suck so I know that I
really enjoyed this mascara and I was
trying to get through a couple of my
other mascaras before I open this one
and I've done a pretty good job of
decluttered and used up a few of my
mascaras since my most recent mascara
declutter
so I'm going to be opening like this one
shortly and I want to see I want to see
how much I can get through this one in a
year so I thought that'd be kind of fun
to see I also did grab out a brow pencil
I didn't want to reach for a super super
new one but I was trying not to go for
like my old school like benefit ones
that have almost like nothing left in
them and kind of like the happy medium
that I found was from a survive
cosmetics there really isn't a ton left
so I feel like this one should be pretty
easy to get through but honestly I have
been trying more and more brow pencils
recently and I feel like I'm using a
different route almost every single day
and this is one of my favorites I also
tried to pull a lot of my favorite
products from my bested Beauty 2017
video because I'm like if these are my
favorites and they're what I'm using so
much I should be able to get through
them or do a pretty good job at them so
this was the only brow product I
mentioned in that video so I thought I
could reach for it that way too but then
also because this is my favorite I know
I'm trying new ones and I'm like loving
on my new ones but I need to remember
some of my faves as well so that is the
brow pencil that I chose I also grabbed
out a blush this is from Tarte cosmetics
and that's the part a blush that I got
as a birthday gift from Sephora so this
is a mini guy but I mentioned the Tarte
blushes probably in my best of video but
I feel like I was mentioning them and
another one too where I was like how am
I ever going to oh it was the makeup I
won't pay full price for that I don't
want to pay $30 or really over $20 for a
blush because it's so hard to get
through them and I said that these minis
I love the size because I think it's
great because it's so hard to even hit
pan on a blush so that's kind of what I
thought of when I was looking over my
blushes I thought if these tart blushes
cuz I was like I wanna see how long does
it really take me to hit pan on one of
these blushes so that's the blush I
chose out because it's a really
beautiful kind of neutral pink and I
really enjoy it I also did pick out a
highlighter this is the mary lou manizer
from the balm cosmetics
I chose this one because this is my lg
highlight this is my very first
highlight that I ever purchased
Marylou my og and I have yet tip Han on
it which is a super super crazy to me I
will say that I am very light handed
when it comes to makeup I I mean I do
not like use and abuse my makeup when I
did they use and abused my coat egg I
was like I feel like nothing really even
looks all that used and abused because
I'm very varied like handed so like some
things don't shock me but this actually
really does surprised me that I have not
at least hit the tiniest bit of pan on
this highlight because it was my only
highlight for a while so I have a lot of
highlights now and I love a high a lot
of highlights now but Marylou look
you're my G we're gonna show you some
love lots of love in 2018 I did grab out
lipsticks was kind of hard I'm not gonna
lie lipsticks was kind of hard but I did
grab a couple different lip products and
I just kind of want to see again going
back to not focusing so much on having
to finish these products but seeing what
I finish how much I finish just seeing
you know kind of that result and result
by the beginning of next year
so I picked out one from mac cosmetics
and this is called age sex location it's
one of my absolute favorite nudes and
I'm just like obsessed with it right now
I keep wearing it I keep reaching for it
this is what it looks like completely
twisted up so that's what age sex
location looks like again I just I reach
for at a ton and I'm just be really
curious to see how I did I just want to
see I just want to know so that is one
of the lip products that I grabbed out
there's a few more so moving over to a
couple more lip products that picked out
I did grab out this one from the Kat Von
D it's one of the everlasting liquid
lipsticks in Ludwig our Ludvig this is a
deluxe sample as well but I know that
lip products are probably hard to get
through especially for me particularly
because I have such a huge collection
and I love trying different colors and
shades and formulas and all of that so I
thought the mini size would be pretty
a-ok for me but I love this color and it
goes with me so often I don't really
know how to like kill how much I got
through and so I almost kind of pulled
it back out but I was like no no like
just keep it in and just just see like
you know when you're getting to the end
to an end of a liquid lipstick or what
not so I'll be able
tell but this is one I wear it so often
so again it's a favorite it's always
into my clutch of mine so I want to see
how well I do on that this next one here
is from Maybelline this is in truffle
tease the shade is honestly it's what I
have on today it's obviously really
similar to the Mac age sex location this
is what it looks like and again you know
you can see it has a pretty considerable
dent into it this was one of my favorite
lipsticks I love the Maybelline like
regular lipstick formula from the
drugstore it's one of my favorites and I
owned so many of these but I have had
truffle tease I think I bought it before
I started at YouTube or were like right
when I started YouTube so I've had this
open for a very long time so this is one
of those things that I was like no
matter what at the beginning of the next
year no matter how I do I would just
need to go ahead and toss this one
because it's been open for a very long
time but I love the color it's just kind
of like a staple really nice pretty
lipstick that I reach for so often the
last lip product I put in here was the
glossy a coconut bomb calm I actually
mentioned this in my best of skincare
2017 video along with the glossy a milky
jelly cleansers what it was so I grabbed
up this to chat about as well this is
made it into favorites videos I
absolutely love this a lip balm and I
feel like I really only wear lip balms
like towards the winter months I feel
like in the summer I'd probably go off
from using this quite a bit so I thought
I could still put it in there I feel
like I've made like a pretty
considerable like you can see those kind
of debt marks in there but I know once
like spring summer comes I'll probably
kind of scale back on it and then pick
back up over on the winter time so it'll
be interesting to see where I am from
the end of winter to the beginning of
next winter and then to the beginning of
2019 if that makes sense so this one is
included in there as well I also did
include a setting spray this is the mac
fix+
i love the mac fix+ and you can see that
it is really far down there I was really
trying to find a setting spray that was
maybe about half full because I didn't
think getting through a full bottle
would be the smartest for me because I
have somebody setting spray so I was
trying to find something half full but
really everything was over half but I
picked this one because I already have a
backup max mac fix+ but I'm like I'm
doing that thing with the fix+ because
this is like my OG Mac product this is
my first one of my first probably
from agra for just like three items at
once but this is one of them and i did
that kind of classic thing that i talked
about in my kick off skincare project
pan that I started to get down there on
it and then I just stopped using it I
was like I don't want to run out I don't
want to run out and I have a new one
from Mac so I'm like hello you can use
this now like you're free to use it
again comments so I'm gonna try to get
through this baby
so my final makeup product is from
Maybelline and this is the better skin a
skin transforming powder Aries is nine
next week future and this is one that I
recently did a kind of powder collection
declutter and I mentioned this one and I
said I am so shocked again I know I'm
one hand it but I am so shocked that I
have not hit pan on this because I use
it so often this is what the powder it
looks like it's a really beautiful
powder for the skin with have it in my
clutch it always comes traveling with me
it's such night it's really nice for
touch-ups I like the applicator I like
the mirror so I'm just really surprised
I have not hit pan on it at all yet I've
had it for quite some time so I want to
see what damage I can do in 2018 so that
is the powder that I chose and then I
have two skincare items I just thought
it'd be kind of fun to incorporate a
little bit of skincare and honestly like
I was looking over my collection I
didn't do any eyeshadow palettes which
to me that that's just not but that just
wouldn't be very reasonable for me I'm
always trying a new eyeshadow palette
out all of the time it would be so hard
even to say like I just want to hit pan
on one shadow like I would rather put
skincare in here so just kind of looking
over my collection I was like I'm really
happy with the ones that I picked out
like I could have added more foundations
or concealers and things like that but I
was like I want to add in a little bit
more skincare too because I love
skincare and I thought I could put in
two items from my favorite skincare
products of 2017 as well so the first
one here is from pixie beauty and this
is the peel and polish I have used a
pretty fair amount of this but I feel
like there's still there's still a
decent amount of product in there and I
can really only use this one maybe two
times a week because it is a peel and I
do have sensitive skin so I can't use it
as often as I could say a cleanser or
moisturizer or something like that so I
thought it'd be interesting to see how
much I can use up within the gear and
then the other
item I crept out is the Dermalogica
antioxidant Hydra mist
I'm about half way going with this one
it's not something that I use every
single day but every other day every
couple of days when I need a nice like
hydrating toner spray this is what I
will spray so I want to see again how
far I can get on this one and I have a
backup of this one door logic it did
send me a backup of this one so I have
it and I saved it because I know I love
it so much then I was like okay like I
give you permission to use this up so
those are the two of skin care products
but after that those are the 18 products
and then I want to use up in 2018 I
guess so that's give you everything for
the 18 products that I want to use up in
2018 my prep Japan 2018 video I hope
that you enjoyed seeing the items that I
chose out and I'm super curious for the
check ins and to see how I do throughout
the entire year I'm just very very
curious about this one but I hope that
you enjoyed the video if you are doing a
project pan throughout the year to
please do let me know let us know some
of your products give us your full list
and I yeah I'm excited for it like I
thought I will be doing the quarterly
check-ins out throughout the year as
well but that is it for today's video if
you enjoyed it and enjoyed seeing a new
project pan I hope that you'll give this
video a thumbs up I hope that you will
also consider subscribing before you go
