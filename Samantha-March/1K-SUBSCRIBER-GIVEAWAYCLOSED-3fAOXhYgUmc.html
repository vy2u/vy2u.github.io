video is probably the most exciting one
that I've done so far because it is my
1000 subscribers giveaway video thank
you guys so much for all the love and
support since i started the youtube teen
all a few months back i am like
overwhelmed on a daily basis from the
comments from the feedback that come in
and I'm just so excited that I decided
it on one Saturday afternoon to film a
video and see what happened and i truly
did not expect what happened to happen
and i don't know if that makes any sense
but basically I I did not expect to
become so happy to be on YouTube and
like I just thought it would be
something fun like something a part of
my job like I never expected to have so
much fun like days that I know that I'm
going to film I'm so excited I'm so
excited to do my makeup to do my hair to
pick out my outfit to come up with the
topics to discuss with you guys I have
so much fun looking at your comments
reading your comments watching other
videos like I just feel like I'm finally
doing everything that I need to do and
I'm reaching out to people in all the
different ways that I need to reach out
to them and I'm just so happy that I
took a chance and decided to start this
journey because it has been so
incredible so far I knew I wanted to do
a really big giveaway when we got to
1000 subscribers because that just seems
like such a huge milestone like I
remember starting and getting my first
subscriber and being like and and
already having the idea in my head like
let's do something crazy for 1k when I
first started I was already like that is
a huge miles don't like if I can do that
I feel like I can do anything and
getting the first subscriber and being
like okay well 999 to go and to get
there I remember it happening like in
the morning I came downstairs and I saw
it and I sent my husband a snapchat and
I was just so excited and overwhelmed
and happy and pleased and all that good
stuff so I just want to say thank you i
love doing giveaways so much if you
don't know I am
very active on social media because I am
an author I am a book blogger I am a
lifestyle reviewer a beauty reviewer all
that good stuff I started a blog back in
2009 it's called Chiclets Plus which is
how I got started in everything I am I
published off there are four novels and
I run a publishing company so a lot of
my days and this is my full-time job so
a lot of my days are spent on social
media talking to people getting the word
out about my books spreading the word
about the articles that I right and that
sort of thing and I just love being able
to do giveaways I have so much fun with
it I try to do them as often as I can do
them because I just think it's such a
great way to give back because you know
if Chiclets plus didn't have any
followers or any fans then we wouldn't
have gone anywhere if I didn't have any
fans or anyone buying my books my books
wouldn't go anywhere I want to be able
to keep doing what I'm doing so when I'm
in the position to be able to give back
that's what I want to do so it was
around the time that I got probably 750
subscribers that I started buying from
the giveaway because I wanted to be able
to include like some really cool stuff
but I knew if I waited too long and then
tried to buy everything at once it would
be really overwhelming on my bank
account because this video is not
sponsored no one sent me any of these
giveaway items all of these items are
items that I purchase for myself and I
do not get paid to be on youtube I have
not made a paycheck from youtube so this
is all my money and so I just I wanted
to be able to get really good items for
you guys so I spent the past probably
like month or so two months buying these
items I really hope you guys like them
we have 11 items included I've been
sharing like on my snapchat and a few on
Instagram what's going to be in here so
hopefully some of you will know what's
coming but I'm just so excited but we
should just jump into the giveaway so if
you want to see the giveaway items that
you can win and how to enter the dates
and all that good stuff please keep
watching i'm going to jump into what you
can win first and then i will move on to
how to enter who can enter the dates of
the giveaways and all that good stuff so
first I picked up a few drug store items
and the first one that I have is this
NYX jumbo eye pencil and it is
in milk so it is just a white eye pencil
I have one of these and I feel like it
is just a staple so like I bought mine
because I would watch so many different
makeup tutorials and so many people were
using this you can use it as a base you
can use it for really cool like cut
crease looks like i just i find myself
using it so often it's such a good
product to have like everyone talks
about milk and I feel like you guys
needed to have it so I picked this up
and another one that I feel like it's
talked about is the Loreal infallible
eyeshadow and it is in the shade amber
rush and so amber rush is one that I
don't have but I have a couple of the
Loreal infallible I shadows and I
absolutely love them I think they're
amazing i used them in i think it was my
valentines day makeup tutorial my iced
latte tutorial because i used the shade
iced latté but i love them so many
people love these l'oreal shadows and I
just hear really good things about amber
rush it's supposed to be like a coppery
bronzy color which I thought would be
really cool so that is the one I picked
up for you guys i also have a pair of
lashes in here because you guys need
lashes I love lashes so you need some
too and the ones i picked up our from
our dell these are in their glamour
style and I have so many Glamour's like
I go back and forth between the
Glamour's and like their wispies even
their dumb us fees are really good so
these are the ones I got our doll lashes
are so good especially if you're new to
eyelashes and your kind of unsure bottom
our dell has really easy bands to work
with and usually you do need to cut them
down like I can just tell by looking at
these no matter who wins you're probably
going to need to put them down a little
bit but you will be winning a pair of
these as well and this is the last drug
store item I believe but it is a new
product from Maybelline it is their
master fix by face to do their setting
and perfecting loose powder so that is
what that looks like so it's basically
just what it says it's a loose setting
powder a lot of people are saying it can
kind of be similar to the laura mercier
translucent setting powder and i've been
hearing really good feedback on it so
far i actually wanted to pick one up for
myself
and I don't know why I didn't and I'm
kind of upset about it because I feel
like i'll probably pick going out for
myself because I do need a new setting
powder oh yeah so this is the Maybelline
one and you will be winning this so I
did throw a skincare item in here and
you guys will be winning from glam glow
they're thirsty mud hydrating treatment
this is they're like mini size if you
guys follow my channel or follow me on
snapchat or Instagram you know how much
I love minis I love minis like I have an
obsession with minis like if I can buy
something and the smaller size I'm going
to because it's so hard to go through
full-size makeup and beauty products
like it's just hard to do new things are
coming out we want the new things I'm
like why not save money and why not try
to actually get through a product or
when I do have to throw it away like I
don't feel as bad so I got you guys a
mini I have this in the mini version of
course I love it i've had it for months
and months and i use it at least once a
week if not more and i still have
product left like I don't even feel like
I've come close to hitting the bottom
yet so I got you guys was fun i love
globe glow i really want to try out more
of their products because i think they
are so good i got this one for you guys
because i was trying to decide between a
few different items or no it was the it
was the video that i did that i let you
guys pick it was like a sephora gift
guide video and i said you guys can vote
on all the products that i mentioned in
whichever has the most votes i will buy
for this giveaway this was not the
winner but it was so close that i was
like okay I'm just gonna buy it anyways
because i know that i love it so why not
get it for you guys to fill from
colour-pop also if you guys are
subscribers of mine you know how much i
love color pop i love color Bob so much
and i saw this come out and I thought
this is such a good thing to get for you
guys everyone is seeming to love it so
much but it is the color pop and
Kathleen lights where the night is quad
so it has four different eyeshadows in
here it comes with weenie porter
telepathy and midnight so you will get
for eyeshadows in here I don't want to
open it because I
like feel weird because it's yours but
it is the where the night is quad I hope
you guys really love this and I really
wanted I'm super bummed that I haven't
gotten it because so many shades like I
think I'm just going to buy a weenie on
its own because it looks so beautiful
and you can buy these individual now but
yes one winner will be getting this as
well and then also if you watch my
latest colour-pop all give away i did
mention that this is going to be in the
giveaway but also from colour-pop and
kathleenlights isn't the Lumiere to
liquid lipstick so I do have a full
video on this if you want to see the
swatches and what it looks like on me
but kathleenlights like when she first
collaborated with color pop she came out
with a lippy stick in Lumiere and now
she has just come out with the ultra
matte liquid lipstick and she calls it
Lumiere too because it's supposed to be
Lumiere but just in a liquid lipstick
form and you guys the shade I have been
so obsessed with I've been wearing it so
much I absolutely love it it is a
beautiful like deep mob pink color it
feels really good on the lips I'm so
happy with it so I had to pick you guys
up a Lumiere to as well I also have two
more lip products because you know I
love lip products so much so like why
not have three for you guys I mean like
why not right but the first one that I
got is from kat von d it's one of her
everlasting liquid lipsticks and it is
in the shade lolita i have heard
everyone and their mother their brother
their father their babysitter their
grandmother everyone loves lolita so i
got it for you guys when the lolita
craze started happening I could not get
my hands on it it was always sold out I
was sold out on the websites it was sold
out in sephora it was so sold out that
they wouldn't even have like a tester
there said he actually tried on myself
and like see what it looked like and if
i wanted it anyways and it finally came
back in stock and for some reason i
didn't buy it for myself i only bought
her for you guys I was like darn it I
probably should have bought it for
myself but you will be winning lolita
from kat von d and the last Oh lip
product to win is from
heart and is one of their new TARDIS
lip-paint and the shade I got for you
guys is an man bun which i believe is
like their deep berry color and I
mentioned the TARDIS lip paints in my
most recent favorites video my January
favorites video I have the shade in TBT
and I love it not only do I love the
color but I really really do love the
formulas of the turtle pains I know not
everyone might love it because just so
you know unlike the kat von d and the
Lumiere to those liquid lipsticks dry
completely matte and they will not
transfer at all this does not address
more to a semi-matte finish and it does
have a little bit of transfer to it but
it is very creamy it almost feels like a
NYX soft matte lip cream where it feels
very good on the lips it doesn't feel
drying I don't get the weird inner lip
thing that I do was some of the other
liquid lipsticks and you can reapply it
like with some liquid lipsticks you
can't reapply because it gets to like
cakey and grungy on your lips it does
not happen with this so I personally
love the formula so much and I'm excited
that I bought one for you guys when I
bought the TBT for myself and I hope you
guys really love this one so another one
that I picked up is one that was voted
on by you guys and this is the tartlet
tease palette so it is like one of their
tartlet palettes but in a smaller
condensed version of it so basically
this was just very recently just a
couple weeks ago I posted on Instagram i
said i want to buy one more thing for
the giveaway but i'm stuck between these
four items it was like a two faced item
this a couple of morphe brushes and i
think a dose of color liquid lipstick
and the tartlet teeth fell out one by
one vote i'm so happy that you guys
voted because like i said this giveaway
is for you guys it's not for me so I
didn't want to buy like maybe what I
think is good like I really really
appreciate it being able to have so much
of your feedback because a lot of these
items are ones that you guys voted on
are you guys sent my snapchats and said
that you did want and so I hope you guys
really enjoy this giveaway because it's
all for you but yes so this is the
tartlet tease palette so it is just this
cute little palette it comes with six
different shades I can't read this one
because it's
cut off but whisper crush heartbreaker
BFF first kiss I'm not sure what this
shade is because it is cut off on the
packaging which is kind of weird but
this will be in the giveaway as well and
then the last item in the giveaway is
the one that like I'm most excited for
you guys this was the one when I did put
out the video and asked you guys to vote
this is the one that got the most votes
like everyone said that they want this
and it is the Kat Von D shade light
contour palette so it's not the eye
palette but it's the contour palette so
you get these contour and highlight
shades comes with six different shades I
have heard so many fantastic things
about the shade of light palette I do
have that I palette and I think it's
frickin bomb and I really do want to get
the contour palette I remember buying it
for you guys and I was like I could just
buy one for myself to write but they're
like 46 or forty-eight dollars or
something I was like okay maybe I'll
keep waiting just a little bit longer to
buy one for myself but everyone has
wanted this palette so I got it for you
guys i hope you guys really enjoy it i
hope you give me some feedback on it
because i'm so curious if you guys will
love it as much as I've been hearing
everyone else say they love it but yeah
this one will be included in the
giveaway as well and now please keep

people that watch it can be pretty
intimidating so I'm just so thankful and

I get from so many different people it's
so awesome to be able to make other
friends here on YouTube like I thought

Instagram like my virtual friend list

amazing and I just I just I just love it
