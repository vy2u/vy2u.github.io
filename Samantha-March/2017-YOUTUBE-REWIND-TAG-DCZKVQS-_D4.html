really excited for today's video because
it's gonna be a little bit different
it's going to be a tag video so that's
not really all that different but I'm
excited because it's questions that I've
come up with I have done and tagged
videos on my channel of course I think
that they're a lot of fun when I first
started my channel I did so many tag
videos cuz I was like what what was we
talking about and these videos and tag
videos I think we're really big on at
YouTube and I feel like tag videos are
starting to make a comeback a lot of
other really awesome creators are coming
up with some really fun tags and this
video started off not as a tag it was
just me one night feeling a little
nostalgic you know end of your holiday
time things like that and I was going
through all of my videos that I did in
2017 and just kind of remembering and
just thinking back and I thought what if
I did a tag video like this and I've
been sitting on it for about two weeks
because I'm kind of nervous to do it
just because I've never created a tag or
what not if you will so I was a little
bit nervous to do it but I just thought
it could be fun to share some of my you
know memories from 2017 on YouTube and
then also hopefully if other people do
the tag video to see their you know
memories and just answer these questions
and I just thought it could be fun I'm
really big into nostalgia especially
around this time of year I was talking
about it in a live chat that I did a a
couple weeks ago or whatnot but this
time of year especially I just think
back not just with YouTube but just with
my life in general I make a photo
calendar every single year and I go back
I start all the way in the beginning
with my photos on my phone and I pick
out some of my favorite memories
throughout the year and I put them into
a yearly calendar that sits on my desk
so I have a photo each month it kind of
sparks a memory for me effort from the
year prior so this video this tag video
I think I'm gonna call it like the 2017
YouTube rewind tag
I really hope with some people will do
this video as well and like I said I
just I feel like tags are kind of like
making a comeback right now I have the
beauty community tag that my friend Lisa
Stevens did she tagged me on it that is
on my list my list is ginormous but I'll
definitely be doing that one that you
guys enjoyed there are seven questions
seven questions
20:17 I will have the questions listed
out down below in case you are thinking
about doing the tag video yourself and I
will also take some of my friends and
creators down below as well and I hope
that you guys little do the rewind tag
but why don't we just go ahead and jump
into it with question number one
question number one is what is the first
YouTube video that you post it in 2017
and I couldn't remember this one I was
like I think I know but I'm not a
hundred percent so I didn't have to go
back and look at the slide and it was my
best of beauty 2016 video that was what
I posted on January 1st of 2017 talking
about all my favorites throughout the
previous year if I should number two is
do you have a favorite video you created
this one for me I went back and I went
back and looked at all of my videos
throughout the year and I went over them
and I was trying to think do I have like
an absolute standout favorite and I
don't think that I would be able to pick
just one and I would love to see if
anybody could pick just one or if you
have maybe a couple but me I feel like
some of my favorite videos are and this
might sound strange but some of my
favorite videos are where I just kind of
forget that this video is going on
YouTube and you know hundreds and
possibly thousands of people could watch
it where I just kind of let my walls
fall down and I get a little bit more
vulnerable maybe I talk about my past or
why I started YouTube or where I was out
when I started my youtube channel I did
a live chat fairly recently and was
called positivity and social media and
that one truly might be my favorite one
throughout the year but it just kind of
goes with what I was saying about in
that video I shared about all the great
things that can happen with social media
because there's so much negativity and
there's always such a bad side of social
media and I feel like that gets
highlighted a lot so I feel like the
positivity gets overlooked a lot and
that was a live chat that I did and I
cried a lot which is I don't like to do
and I'll probably get emotional in this
video I can tell I already a.m. I don't
love doing that I don't
showing that kind of vulnerability and
especially during a live chat where it's
easier when you're filming a video
because you can stop you can calm
yourself down you can cut pieces out but
during the live chat I remember I had
this moment where I couldn't really get
control of my emotions and I was like oh
my gosh I'm going to lose it live like
this is embarrassing and I don't I don't
want to feel like showing a
vulnerability is embarrassing because
that's just who I am that's who I've
always been
but that video I felt like was really
important to do and important to talk
about because so much negativity always
gets highlighted the negative videos
always seem to get the views the brain
bashing the people bashing at the same
time they're such a positive aspect of
social media of YouTube of everything
and I felt like it was really important
to highlight that so I was glad that I
created that video I was glad I had that
topic and I was glad that I was able to
show another side of me and just kind of
let the walls come down for 40 minutes
even though it was live and even though
it is on my youtube channel and people
can view it and all of that I feel like
that was a really important one to
create but so that one might be my
favorite if I had to pick but just a lot
of them where I just talk more about
deeper subjects and show a different
side to me I really enjoy those types of
videos so number three question number
three was do you have a video that you
made that was outside of your comfort
zone and I felt like I did a few videos
in 2017 that I would consider it to be
outside my comfort zone I did a couple
vlogs throughout the year they were
mostly in the summer my husband and then
another couple of our friends a married
couple we created a bucket list in the
summer we had too many cocktails one
night and we decided it would be a good
idea to create a bucket list and we did
and it kind of started off as a joke but
then we were like no this is actually
really fun because every weekend if we
just had downtime it wasn't the what do
you want to do I'm here what do you want
to do I'm Kara what do you want to do it
was let's look at the bucket list
pick what we can do today and then go
out and do it and we had so many
adventures we had so much fun we did so
many different things we saw so many
different things I
in Des Moines Iowa for ten years 11
years 12 years and I was seeing parts of
Des Moines that I had never seen before
I'm like how have I lived here with this
long and I've never been to this area
ever seen you know this place like it
was kind of crazy to me but it was a lot
of fun and I decided at one point maybe
it could be fun to vlog it I was able to
vlog some of our fun times and it's cool
because we'll always have those memories
to look back on and which is kind of fun
not only just the vlogs that put
together but the vlog footage like I'll
always save those videos because they're
just fun to look back on they were
outside of my comfort zone not only to
put on to the Internet but also just to
like film you know going out somewhere
and pulling my camera out or pulling my
phone out to record and you know doing
all these different things like they
were different they were challenging to
edit especially because I feel like you
look at so many of like the big
youtubers but they're amazing like movie
trailer quality vlogs and then it's like
me traipsing through the woods in Iowa
like come on guys this is fun
yeah that was a little bit scary and
whatnot it was definitely outside of my
comfort zone number four is what video
did you post on your birthday do you
guys never remember and you know maybe
you have to be like around my age your
generation to remember this but like on
social media like I'm thinking back to
like the myspace days when there was
tags on MySpace and people would say
like go to the fourth person you texted
it in your phone and read the third
message that they sent you or something
like that you know I'm saying that's
kind of like what I had in mind for this
question and I was trying to think at
first I was like post like what video
did you post the first day of summer or
something like that and then I thought
maybe would be funnier to like ask what
you posted on your birthday or the video
closest to your birthday type of thing
and just like chat about it do you
remember posting it do you remember the
idea you had for it and that sort of
thing
I did post on my birthday which is March
23rd and I actually posted my 15,000
follower subscriber giveaway so that was
kind of crazy because I didn't remember
that I I could not remember what I
posted I was pretty sure I posted on my
birthday but I couldn't remember exactly
what it was that I did and it was my
15,000 subscriber giveaway so it's
really crazy to think at the end of
March and you know now we're to the end
of December to see kind of war
my growth has been so that was really
cool to kind of look back and remember
that video did you post on or like right
before after your birthday I want to
know well question number five was did
you find a new channel or creator in
2017 and I found a lot I feel like 2017
was the year where I made so many
friendships on YouTube and it has been
it's so exciting I wrote down a list of
some names I will have these all linked
in the description box because these are
also gonna be the ladies that I am
tagging to do this video as well so all
of them will be in the description box
and I hope that you'll go and check them
out if you haven't yet but these names
are probably gonna be pretty familiar to
you if you have been around my channel
for a while
and honestly I started to write down so
many and I was like I do need to like
cut it off at some point but I am
definitely planning on making another
you know like my favorite youtubers to
watch type of video I did one fairly
recently I think it was like late fall
that I did that one I will have it
linked down below but I will be doing
another one as well because I feel like
I have found so many great channels
lately which has been really exciting
but some of my favorite channels that I
found in 2017 and creators that I found
definitely who I feel like it's like my
best friend here on YouTube is live from
live loves her makeup
we formed a friendship I believe it was
like early summer late spring early
summer we just kind of found each other
on YouTube for me at least
she was recommended to me from my
subscribers and I started watching her
videos just one of those things where
like I felt kind of like an instant
connection with her and we just became
very fast friends and I just I love live
I talked to her every single day so I
loved her also Lisa Stevens she's become
such a good friend of mine as well we're
currently in the midst of doing a collab
actually I'm doing my project pan
skincare a collab with her so I've been
clubbing with her on that since November
so we've done a couple of videos in
collaboration with each other and just
enjoy her channel I feel like she's just
very relatable and down-to-earth and
she's someone like me who just wants to
talk about makeup but she enjoys doing
that which I just think is super fun
also Nicole Renee Cutler I found in 2017
as well I love Nicole I've done a collab
video with her as well I love her love
for animals I love Bailey's mission I've
purchased the the shirt from Bailey's
mission that says like all I want to do
is
cows drink margaritas and pet my dog and
I wear that one all of the time but I
always get asked so many questions when
I ever wear that one when I'm out and
about but she's just such a girl boss
and I just think she's amazing
also Kaylie bow say I know Kaylie nobody
could say your last name every time
someone says Kelly Bob say ralick am I
saying that right so I feel like I
probably I get wrong as well but Kaylie
has been someone who I just love
watching her videos every time she post
one I just I just get excited for him I
love the new content that she sprang
she's given me so many good ideas as
well I've done so many of her videos and
her ideas that she has come up with here
on YouTube inspires me to constantly
keep thinking of new video ideas as well
and then also Kelly Kelly Gooch I think
is how you say her last name but Kelly I
love Kelly's channel we were planning to
do a collab back in like December I
think it was and we had to put it on
pause for a little bit while she was
traveling with her job but we are coming
back we're getting another idea put
together so we will be doing the clapper
soon and I'm so excited to do that one
with Kelly again I feel like a lot of
these people that I'm talking about have
channels very similar to mine you know
we just have a love for makeup and we
just want to talk about it a lot of us
are very kind of like the chatty
channels we don't necessarily do a ton
of tutorials and we can't teach you a
ton of things about makeup but we just
like to talk about it and I think that's
really fun and that kinda is Kelly's
channel I was really excited to see my
friend Katie start a channel in 2017
which has been so exciting
Katie Marie from my vanity she has been
my friend on Instagram for a very long
time been following each other on
Instagram supporting one another over
there for a very very long time and
she's also had a great blog for several
years and I was really excited when she
decided to start a YouTube channel in
2017 also Angelica I should have really
watched the video I did a video recently
where she said her name because she was
saying she was getting so many comments
that people have not being able to say
her name properly and she said her first
name in her last name over and over and
over again and I was like I should have
watched that right before I sat down to
film this part because I really want to
say her name right
but I love her bloop she is a Swedish
and I just saw her channel fairly
recently as well she creates the most
fun vibrant colorful eye Lopes and again
she just likes to chat about my
and I think she is super fun also I'm
drea Matt Giuliano I have recently
started watching as well and that was
another one who so many of you guys
suggested her channel to me in my
comments and I've started watching her
her videos are so gorgeous and beautiful
like I always feel like I'm commenting
the same thing on her videos like you're
editing is amazing your lighting looks
so good like you're just doing awesome
girl
but again just I love her videos as well
have three bigger channels that I think
I started watching these in 2017 one I
have on my list is Jessica brown or Jam
beauty 89 I might have found her in 2016
but I feel like 2017 really was a year
where I just really fell in love with
Jessica and I've mentioned this in a
past video but I really do credit
Jessica for making something click in my
mind when it came to my youtube channel
that I didn't have to try to be like
everybody else and just because I have a
beauty channel doesn't mean I have to do
a tutorial every other video on my
channel and you know I don't I can just
sit here and talk about my love for
makeup and reviewing makeup and coming
up with the creative ideas like she said
that in the video once she said I'm not
a tutorial based channel I just like to
talk about makeup and I was like that's
why I started my channel like I just
wanted to talk about it I never thought
when I sat down to film that I was going
to be doing tutorials and things like
that and she kind of made that all click
for me so she is such a huge like
inspiration and motivator to me with my
own channel so definitely damn Beauty 89
also that girl Shay XL I mentioned her
as well in my beauty youtubers that I
love to watch but I love Shay I feel
like she is so freaking down-to-earth
and so fun and I love her personality
but also she does create amazing
tutorials I did the video recently
talking about my favorite and least
favorite YouTube videos to watch and I
mentioned that I really do love
tutorials because I need them to help me
because I'm not good at doing makeup
myself like I need to follow a
step-by-step tutorial and I love her
tutorials because they are always
different and they're just kind of
outside the box but like not too crazy
at the same time like she puts together
color combinations and ideas that I
wouldn't think of but when I see them
I'm like that is
such a good idea so I loved her
tutorials I love her vibes and we talk a
lot on Twitter which whenever she tweets
me I'm like she just tweets me like it's
the craziest thing ever and then also a
new channel I found in 2017 is Jamie
Genevieve
she is from Scotland I want to say I
might be incorrect in saying that but
she has the best accent ever and I found
her channel again based on subscriber
recommendations people are saying I
think that you would really like this
girl she has amazing tutorials she's
freaking so beautiful I love her accent
I love her dog oh my gosh she's got the
most beautiful dog I watched all of her
vlogs but she's a new channel that I
found as well I think she's a fairly
bigger channel I think she's under 1
million still but she has a lot a lot of
subscribers but she's amazing and I've
been loving her videos so those are just
you know a few channels that I found in
2017 that I really love I really wanted
to include that one too because I love
the idea of giving shoutouts to other
creators I try to do it as often as I
can
if I you know have a tag video that I'm
doing I always want to take that person
of course or just shout people out as
often as I can I put out a newsletter
monthly and I always feature another
influencer in there with an interview
and then I always feature that
influencer in my makeup monthly at the
end of the month as a shout out as like
a favorite Channel I think it's a really
cool way to find people because so many
of these ladies that I mentioned I found
through recommendations as well so I
want to do my part I want to be
recommending channels that I love and
you know people who I consider my
friends because I feel like I've made
such like a so many cool friendships and
little community here on YouTube and
it's been really really special and
that's something that I've definitely
felt in 2017 so I really wanted to
include that question as well and then
number six is did you find any new
favorite brands in 2017 and again this
list could have gone on forever but I
tried to narrow some of them down
honestly Urban Decay in 2017 totally
took me by storm and took me by surprise
I've tried so many products from urban
decay from foundations concealers
highlights bronzers eyeshadow palettes
from Urban Decay in 2017 and there are
not a lot of misses for me that was a
brand that for whatever reason I didn't
gravitate towards a ton
and 2017 changed that and I've tried a
lot from them and I've been so freakin
impressed I feel like I'm constantly
recommending urban decay also dosa
colors I purchased from dosa colors for
the first time in 2017 and it became
like an instant obsession for me I just
purchased another eyeshadow palette from
them I've purchased more lipsticks
around the by of so many of the dose of
colors liquid lipsticks also Kevin of
Kwan I tried Kevin upon for the first
time I think it was in 2017 and I've
realized that
hence products are so good at so quality
and it's it's a more expensive brand it
is it's a pricey brand but so many
products that I have tried from Kevin OH
Kwan have been just top-quality
very very solid products also number
seven I was I've been so impressed with
so many things from number seven I
mentioned them so often in my best of
beauty 2017 video from their skincare to
their makeup there's not a lot from
number seven that I don't love I've just
been very impressed with the brain as a
whole honestly when I said I don't know
filmless I was like this is gonna be
like a seven minute video and I don't
even know my camera overheats so I have
no idea what's time rep but if you like
this is turning out to be much longer
than I thought it was gonna be obviously
cuz I love Chuck but question number
five is what is a favorite YouTube
memory from 2017 and again just like
icing with the videos I don't know if I
have a certain like one exact favorite
memory from YouTube but one of my
favorite kind of memories in general
that I'll take away from 2017 is really
finding a sense of friendship and a
sense of community on YouTube that to me
has been one of the greatest memories
not only being able to have such strong
connections with subscribers and the
people that follow me and comment
because I felt that from honestly the
very beginning I really did I felt that
very strong connection very early on
when starting my channel but I felt like
in 2017 I really made real genuine
friendships people who I have their
phone numbers now you know I can text
them if I have a question or if
something is bothering me I can ask them
on you know Instagram or snapchat
another great memory I think I'll take
away from 2017 is seeing other women
support other women it is so so huge
and something I haven't really had in my
life a lot so to have that even though
you know we're all doing the same thing
and we all want to grow and we all want
to succeed but I feel like there's a lot
of these creators and especially the
women that I mentioned earlier that
understand that you're not just number
one on YouTube or Instagram or whatever
it is like there's really no Queen or
top spot it's it's a bunch of people and
it's so much better when we can all
succeed and it's better when we all get
to stand behind each other I mean we all
motivate each other share about each
other that has really been one of my
favorite favorite memories from 2017 and
it's really remote evaded me and given
me a new fire and given me new hope I've
talked about it before that when I
started my youtube channel I was in a
pretty bad place and a lot of it had to
do with other women not being this way
in my real life and it was really
challenging and it was really hard to
deal with and to sit to see this and to
see how excited as I'm filming this I
hit 40,000 subscribers overnight and I
woke up to a snapchat from my friend
Katie that was mentioning earlier she
sent me a snap of it and she was so
excited about it I'm getting other
comments and from other creators and the
other gals that I mentioned being
excited for me there's no there's not
jealousy there and I just think that's
freaking amazing so that's been such a
such a wonderful memory and and
something that I will remember happening
in 2017 I think it's so freakin cool so
question number six is how many videos
did you publish in 2017 and this was
really hard because I really thought the
analytics would tell me this and maybe
if someone is better at the analytic
side of things you could tell me if you
could figure this out
I really thought it would tell me how
many videos I posted but I couldn't find
that I could find like every other stat
in there except for how many videos I
post it so I went through and just kind
of loaded all of my entire videos and
then they were in rows of four so I
counted and then multiplied and I'm not
great at math so who knows if I did this
right but I came up with right around
290 videos I think I posted in the year
of 2017 which that's a lot of videos I
didn't
start daily videos until I think it was
the summer was it the summer that I
challenged myself to do a video every
single day in the summer but I was
already on like a four to five day
posting schedule before that and then I
want to say was over the summer I
challenged myself to post every single
day and then it kind of just went from
there about 290 or so I think it'll be
just shy of 300 for 2017 I would love to
know as well how many videos you posted
did you think you posted that number or
did you think it was maybe more or less
I would - no super nosy with these
questions and then number seven is what
made you proud are what would you
consider accomplishment that you
achieved in 2017 kind of relating to
YouTube and to me I think kind of what
made me really proud of myself in 2017
is that it just kind of feels like I
felt like I found myself and a lot of
that has to do with all of these you
know other great channels that I was
talking about the friendships formed you
know the the motivation that these other
channels and creators give me so was
able to figure out you know why I
started a channel in the first place not
to to lose myself just because I started
a YouTube channel not to compare myself
to all these other channels that have
already been out there for so many years
not to get caught up I don't feel like
there was ever a time throughout 2017
then I got hung up on numbers views
subscribers any of that like I get
excited when a video does well I get
excited to hit you know new
stepping-stones of the subscribers but I
don't feel like there was ever a time in
2017 where I was focused on that I was
focused on creating my videos continuing
to love the videos that I create and
challenging myself to come up with new
and fun things to create so I can still
have a passion for my videos and I feel
like that's something that I am really
proud of in 2017 just kind of not losing
myself but also gaining more confidence
and just being more comfortable and just
kind of figuring out where I fit in I
mean there's so many different channels
on YouTube and even just within the
beauty community anyways there's so many
different channels there's so many
different niches out there and I feel
like I kind of found myself I found my
footing in 2017 and
to me that that really is an
accomplishment you know I I figured out
how to to be myself and to be happy with
that and sometimes that can be a really
challenging thing those are the seven
questions in the 2017 YouTube rewind tag
and my answers and I know this was
probably a longer video and I'm sorry I
felt like I kind of had explained where
the tag came from really excited to do
this video like I said I've been
thinking about doing it for a couple
weeks now and just having so much fun
going through the year and going through
my year on YouTube and I would really
really love if anyone else wanted to do
this tag of course please tag me and let
