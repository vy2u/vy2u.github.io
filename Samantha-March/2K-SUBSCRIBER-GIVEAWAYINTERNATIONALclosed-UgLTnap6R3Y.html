I'm so excited for today's video because
I'm finally going to be doing my two
thousand little scrapper giveaway I'm so
happy to be doing this obviously because
it means that we had a new milestone on
YouTube two thousand subscribers which
is so so very exciting to me I remember
the day that I hit it and I feel like
what excited me the most about getting
to 2000 was the number of people that
was telling me I was getting snapchats
and people are tweeting me and writing
on my videos and that was the part that
seriously was the coolest out of all of
it and I just appreciate it so much I
have made so many new friendships and
connections since jumping on YouTube and
it's just wild to think about I've been
in the social media game for like eight
years or something is when I started my
blog and I started my my publishing
business and a big part of being an
author which is what I do for my
full-time career a big part of that is
being on social media being present out
there and making new connections with
readers and that sort of thing so I've
always been in that world for so long I
truly can't remember a time that I
wasn't but to think that it just opened
up so many more new friendships it's
just what really gets me every single
day it's so exciting for me to log on
and see what people are saying and to
open my snapchat to see what you guys
have to say and it's just it's amazing I
thank you so much some really cool
opportunities of started to come my way
because of this and because of you guys
and for that I'm just so appreciative i
love doing giveaways so much the reason
that my two thousand subscriber giveaway
is a little bit behind is because i did
a five thousand one on Instagram that I
teamed up a couple of our friends and we
did like a huge bomb giveaway on
Instagram I do little mini ones all the
time on Instagram on snapchat on my
other social medias I have one I have a
beauty newsletter and I just did I give
away in there so i just i love it i love
doing giveaways i love giving back
because i'm just so appreciative of what
i get to do i will be going over each
product that one winner will receive I
think there is 12 products altogether
too
quote me but somewhere between like 10
and 12 products that one winner will be
receiving i will go over all the rules
and how you can enter and all that good
stuff that you need to know but i just
want to say thank you so much for
watching my videos for liking the videos
for subscribing for following me and the
different social media platforms and
just for supporting me it means so much
truly honestly it means so much i hope
we can do so many more giveaways in the
future because i love giving back to you
guys a lot of this at CVS because if you
guys follow the end up you know that i
use like an excuse i can to go to CVS i
love that place would so one thing that
i picked up from Mabley is the color
tattoo 24 hour and the lavish lavender
it looks like this it obviously still
has like all the packaging everything on
it because i'm not going to take that
off because it's not mine really do like
these Maybelline crayons and I think
they are very long-lasting on the eyes I
mean it does say that their 24-hour
which I don't think I've ever worn it
for 24 hours but I have wore them all
day and they really do last or they are
also a really good base if you're
looking for a good base for your
eyeshadow these are a really good option
as well so you'll be getting the one in
lavish lavender the next thing I picked
up i believe is a new product from
Milani it's their moisture lock peach
seed oil infused lip treatment and it
looks like this pardon me I took my
nails off this week and they just like
need a little bit of a break but I want
it to film this and I didn't think nails
were more important than to give away so
don't mind me don't have any nails on
sorry about that do believe this is
maybe a new product from Milani it said
knew when I bought it which I don't even
remember how long ago it was but it's
just like lip oils been a few companies
that have put out these kind of products
I've never tried him for myself but I am
really big I'm like exfoliating my lips
hydrating my lips just because I wear so
many different liquid lipsticks and I'm
constantly wearing lipstick like every
single day nearly it feels like that I
just want to make sure my lips are in
like top condition if you know what I
mean so I do want to try a little myself
so you guys want to tell me what you
think is this from wet'n'wild I picked
up one of their new nail polishes
because I do love nail polish so this is
there one step wonder gel and the color
I picked up is in coral support so it
looks like this this is supposed to be
like an all-in-one type of nail polish
like when you put it on
not supposed to need like a base coat or
a top coat I've never tried these myself
so I don't know but I have seen some
good feedback on these so I thought
coral support would be like a fun
summery color I love coral for the
summer oh you guys will be getting this
one as well and from covergirl I picked
up one of their oh sugar lip treatments
in the color caramel it looks like this
I have one of these mine is in cupcake
and I'm obsessed with it I've almost
used it I bought these at the same time
which was maybe like probably over a
month ago and I'm almost through mine
already because I wear it so often it
feels so good on the lips and again like
I said with the lip oil treatment I'm
always making sure my lips have like
something on them to keep them like
hydrated and smooth and normal looking
and you know all that good stuff so you
will be getting this from covergirl so
from Neutrogena you'll be getting some
makeup remover cleansing towelettes
these are my favorites makeup remover
wipes the blue ones from Neutrogena I
absolutely love them I actually ran out
of them and went to repurchase them at
target and they came in like a two pack
and I was like well one for me one for
you so you guys will be getting 25
pellets from Neutrogena they are amazing
makeup remover wipes really love the
little pallets from elf cosmetics and I
picked up the bronzer palette because
who doesn't want to be bronze in the
summer so it comes with four different
shades of bronzer so you can use them
probably two bronze to contour I like
these pallets I have a blush one that
has three blushes and a bronzer it comes
with a big mirror it's just such a great
little compact I just I love elf
cosmetics truly so many things that I've
tried from them I really appreciate but
especially these little pallets so
you'll get the bronzer one and of course
I had to include eyelashes in here
because i love eyelashes i think i put
eyelashes and like all of my big boys
that I can because I Club eyelashes
these are one of my favorite pairs there
from i lure in Vegas nay in the style
shining star so they look like this I
have this pair and I wear them so often
i think they are beautiful and i wanted
to let you guys know i am gonna film an
eyelash tutorial and tips video you guys
been asking for it for months and months
and months and i have finally like been
able to figure out how to work the
camera and work the mirror and be able
to do it I think I got it figured out
I'm gonna film it on my schedule get
excited and because you're going to win
these so also some skin care to be
included in here from sephora i picked
up there Rose a face mask so it looks
like this I've tried out several
different sephora face masks and i love
them so i picked the rose one up for you
guys it says this is the ultra
moisturizing and brightening face mask
mmm I just I'm obsessed with face masks
right now I love them they feel so good
good stuff I picked up two things for
morphy kind of by accident I shall
explain so the first thing that you're
going to get is a brush and this is the
e36 brush so it's in its little
packaging but it looks like this I
actually have one if you guys watch my
makeup tutorials i use the e36 in almost
every single tutorial i use it to smudge
shadows on my lower lash line and it is
bomb when i bought this i did not think
I would fall in love with this teeny
like detail brush as much as I did but I
use it every single time that i do
makeup i think it is fantastic I can't
imagine not having one and somehow i
order to completely by accident like I
remember getting the package of being
like why would i order two of these like
I was on the fence about ordering them
so obviously I didn't order two and my
first thought like this is how much I
love giveaways my first thought was in
okla now I have a backup my first
thought was oh wow put that in a good
boy then so you guys will be getting the
e36 from morphe and it's pretty cool
because if you've been wanting to pick
this up morphy has currently there Elite
Collection which since this is the e36
it's from the market elite collection
that entire collection is gone they had
a huge sale on it they had forty percent
off all their elite brushes to sell them
out because they're actually I think
like redoing the line and they're going
to come back out with them but I've been
looking to like link the elite brushes
in my makeup tutorials that I've
recently posted and the elite brushes
are gone so if you wanted the e36 and
you can get it now you're gonna get it
and the original product that i picked
up for more fee is one of their eye
shadow palettes this is the 12 n B
palette so I don't want to like take it
out of its box or anything but if I can
find a photo I'll try really hard to
find
inside photo I will put it right here
but I just thought it was such a pretty
pretty palette I will also link it below
in the description box so you'll be able
to go to the market website and see all
the different shades for yourself but it
comes with 12 eyeshadow shades that's
where the 12 envy comes from so it comes
from 12 different shades I absolutely
love the morphe shadows I on several of
their palates and I think they're all
amazing so the winner will get to 12 and
be a shadow palette and then the winner
will also receive a blush palette I'm
pretty excited about this one from urban
decay and it's part of the Gwen Stefani
collaboration that she did with them so
this is what the palette looks like I
know it's kind of like blinding and then
the back it lists all the six different
blushes that you will get which i think
is so cool but the winner will be
receiving this urban decay and Gwen
Stefani blush palette then the last
thing that the winner will be receiving
it from Kylie cosmetics and it is one of
the matte liquid lipsticks with matching
lip liner the shade is in Posey k you
can see it right there and pose AK I
don't own it myself but actually it is
similar to me to what I'm wearing right
now which is Lumiere to from colour-pop
just from like the swatches that I've
seen and liked seeing it online that's
kind of like what I think it's similar
to will come with a liquid lipstick and
then also of matching lip liner the lip
liner will also be in Posey k I do have
candy carry from Kylie cosmetics and I
do think it is a really good formula I'm
I was really really impressed with the
formula of the liquid lipstick I think
it is super long-lasting like super
long-lasting I wore it in my bridesmaid
glam / long-lasting make a tutorial
video because I think it's one of my
longest lasting liquid lipsticks that I
own I know that the Carly cosmetics
lipsticks are so hard to get ahold of so
when I place my order with Kylie
cosmetics I've only ordered from them
once I got three lip glosses I look what
lipstick for myself and then I was like
I'm gonna pick one up for my subscriber
giveaway because I know these are hard
to get your hands on so the winner will
get Posey k products that one wonder
will be receiving so excited for you
actually a little bit jealous of some of
the products they'll be getting because
I want them to but that's okay it's not
what this is about this is about you
this is not about me
this is that you follow the products
that one winner will be receiving to
