today's video is going to be the four or
more tag I have had this tag on my list
for a so long I saw Lauren my beauty and
also Lisa Stevens do this one a fairly
recently I believe they said Emily Noel
actually created this tag like two or
three years ago like it's a tag that's
been out there for quite some time but I
had something really similar to this on
my filming list basically just talking
about makeup products that I have
repurchased a several up so several of
the same lipstick brand and that's kind
of what got this idea started in my head
for me because when I was talking about
certain brands I kept saying and I've
gone on to repurchase you know different
shades and that tells you how much I
really love it so I really wanted to do
a video like this and then when I saw
the four or more tag start to come back
I thought perfect I will just go ahead
and do that tank so I will have Laurens
channel Lisa's channel and also Emily
Noel I will have all of their channels
listed in my description box if you want
to see more videos like this but if you
would like to see a little bit of my
makeup collection and what I have 4 or
more products of why don't I go ahead
and get started
let's probably won't be shocking but the
majority of this video is going to be
lip products so I'm gonna start with lip
products and then I'm gonna switch over
to eyes and then I'm gonna come back to
lips just to kind of mix it up but I'm
going to kick it off with one of my
favorite liquid lipstick brands that is
a dose of colors and their liquid
lipsticks for this video I tried to keep
it for items that I have repurchased
myself versus something that I've
received a lot of in PR and things like
that because I just thought that when I
was having this original video idea I
wanted to show what I keep repurchasing
what I love so much that I want more of
in my collection and that sort of thing
and dose of colors I have purchased
every single one of these liquid
lipsticks myself I have let's see I have
six different shades here the first one
that I ever bought from Joseph colors
was stone this was featured in my top 20
nude and pink lipstick video I'll have
that would elicit down below and then
also lazy Daisy was featured in that one
as well but I also have the shade minty
which I believe this was a limited
edition shade and then the other one
that I know is not limited edition this
one was actually sent to me from my
friend Candice this is in rosebud it's a
really cool cool toned pink color and
then these two were also in the set with
lazy Daisy
they are not available right now but I'm
pretty sure they are going to be coming
out as a permanent shade of her Danna
the owner of dose of colors say that and
these are in the shades let's cuddle and
warm and fuzzy I really do hope that
they come back but I love the dose of
colors liquid lipstick formula I talk
about it all the time these are about
$18 so they are more pricey but I mean
I've purchased six different shades so I
love them so something a little bit more
affordable from the drugstore is the
Maybelline lipsticks I have four
currently in my collection right now
there has been a time where I had a lot
more in my collection as well and I've
just kind of been declaring them
throughout the years because when I
first started building up my lipstick
collection Maybelline is really what I
have the most of in there I love their
regular lipstick formula and it's like
seven or eight dollars depending on
where you can find them at the drugstore
and I just think that they are amazing
truffle tees and clay crush were both
featured in my top 20 videos so that one
will be linked down below I have
everything swatched out there as well
including on me
so I love these colors I also have a
peach buff and born with it these are
actually sent to me from my friend
Brooke I believe she sent me both of
these actually but it doesn't matter to
me like they're creamy collection at
their matte collection I really enjoy
all of them and like I said they're just
a really good price point and they're
just a really nice regular lipstick if
you're not a liquid lipstick fan I would
suggest checking out Maybelline because
these are some of my favorite lipsticks
another liquid lipstick brand that I
absolutely love and was featured heavily
in my top 20 video is huda beauty so I
first purchased I sent from huda beauty
that had too many liquid lipsticks in
there and also a lip liner I was so
impressed I went on and purchased a
full-sized liquid lipstick from her and
then also when her new nude collection
came out of Mini at liquid lipsticks I
purchased that again so I should
actually have four or five six I should
have seven of her liquid lipsticks and
I'm only holding five here one I did
give away so I'm missing one I will have
to find that I looked in my purse before
I did this video to make sure I had
everything grabbed out but I might have
missed it in there so I currently have
six liquid lipsticks from huda beauty in
my top 20 video I mentioned a girlfriend
which is the full-size that I have and
then also a wifey this is like one of my
go-to news at the moment I absolutely
love it and then I also do have a sugar
mama bombshell
and then trendsetter up the full sizes
are $20 I definitely love when they come
out these many versions as well because
I think for my set of four I paid like
$24 or something like that for four
minis and because I have such a huge a
lipstick collection I just had to put
lipstick to clutter my filming lists the
other day that's gonna be us that day
but since I have such a big lipstick
collection obviously it takes me some
time to get through a lipstick so I have
zero problems bike minis and I enjoy
having a little bit of a break on the
cost but still getting really fun
lipsticks so huda beauty definitely some
of my favorite liquid lipsticks out
there already going off lip support a
little bit I have some eye products here
I definitely have four or more singles
from makeup geek I started buying the
makeup geek singles I'm pretty sure
before I even started a YouTube channel
because I've always heard so many people
talking about makeup geek makeup geek
was a brand that I mentioned in my video
where I talked about brands I wish would
come into Sephora and Ulta and I saw the
news that they're coming into stores I
don't think it said which store I'm
assuming Ulta but I don't think that was
said for sure but they're coming into a
store and I am so excited about that I
think that's exactly what that brand
needs because this used to be such a
talked about loved on brand and then
often I just kind of like lost steam
somewhere along the way which is really
upsetting but I'm really excited to see
them coming back so I have a lot of
different shades I believe everything in
this magnetic palette I did purchase
myself a sum of the first shades that I
purchased Peach Smoothie a creme brulee
shimma shimma Coco bear this one is
bitten over here I think this one is
called like Envy I loved these shades
it's so much and then I also have
another magnetic palette full of more of
their single shades it's only the makeup
geek single shadows I definitely have
more than four of them another brand
that I have for shadow singles from is
Anasazi Beverly Hills I have this little
palette that I put together from Ulta
they were having a special one time like
buy for for $40 and get a palette free
or something like that but I took
advantage of it I have a let's see can I
recall the names off the top of my head
I know that this one is Birkin burnt
orange pink champagne
and I believe are the shape names I
actually don't really love the Anastacio
singles I like the maths just fine but
the shimmers don't really do much for me
and I tend to reach for my Anastacio
pellets especially the modern
renaissance over these singles here and
burnt orange I believe is in modern
Renaissance as well but I have four
Anastasio singles as well some eyeshadow
palettes that I have four or more of are
the morphe palette I do have a lot of
morphia eyeshadow palettes I did have
some gifted to me from friends I also
recently have gotten on the morphe PR
list I have definitely bought at least
four morphe palettes on my own if not
more I've purchased the three 500 the 35
t was the first morphe eyeshadow palette
that I ever purchased I've purchased the
35 are so I purchased definitely a lot
of the morphe palette they were really
helpful to me when I was first like
starting to build up my makeup
collection because they actually were
more affordable and that's also getting
a bunch of different shades to try to be
able to experiment with because
especially when I had a smaller
collection and I would watch tutorials
and I would want to recreate them I was
struggling because I wouldn't have a lot
of the shades in there and if you
watched I did I recreating a youtube
video before it became a thing to do
that video I love it looks it down below
but I say that I followed YouTube
tutorials and I follow them really
really closely so when someone was using
a shade that I didn't have it would like
stress me out so it's really nice to
have these big 35 palettes because they
came with so many different shades I did
just do a declutter recently but these
are the morphe pellets that stuck around
with me I have the 25 a and the 25 V
palettes of course the morphe and Jaclyn
hill pellet had to stay my collection
it's one of my favorite palettes I just
recently got the 24 g from morphe so I
kept that one in my collection and then
I did want to keep the 3 500 mostly
being a youtuber and having it for like
comparison sakes and things like that
that's why I decided to keep the 3/5 oh
and also the a3 502 I really really love
this palette so I did want to keep that
one so that's currently what my morphe
palette collection looks like but yeah
I had even more than this at one time
next up I have quite a few color pop pal
it's like a lot I probably could have
talked about the colour-pop super shock
shadows as well I think I probably still
have four but they're just not my
favorite and I would rather just talk
about the palettes because I think the
palettes are so much better than these
super shock shadows when they came out
with their pressed eyeshadows I got so
excited and clearly like I've hello
hello I think I have purchased all of
these myself except for the yes please
palette my friend Candace sent to me and
then this original palette here I had
another friend sent to me as well this
was like one of the first palettes that
really came out from colour-pop with
four of the press shadows in there I've
recently purchased the a Lyceus magic
palette I love this palette I think it
is so so that I'm very impressed with it
I also recently purchased the dream
street palette in collaboration with
kathleenlights it's also a really nice
palette and then I have the two palettes
here that I love Sarah E or Karen did in
collaboration with color pop and again I
really enjoyed these I did my affordable
palette declutter fairly recently and I
just have a really hard time saying
goodbye to any of these color palettes
because I like them so much I know
people who are saying I could pop these
out and put them into one big Z palette
but I actually don't mind having these
little palettes like this alright I
personally don't mind it and it's kind
of like what I prefer so I like I like
keeping my little singles in here like
this I don't mind that at all but yeah
definitely the color palette pressed
eyeshadows and their palettes I'm
clearly a big fan of so next up I will
briefly talk about some lashes that I
currently own four or more of in my
collection who knows what I'm gonna say
oh yes the pure lashes I know I know if
you're newer to my channel
I love the pure lashes you could call me
the hype girl for the pure lashes if you
want I'm waiting for Pierre give me a
job offer as the hype girl for these
lashes it's okay I'm waiting it's found
waiting these are my favorite lashes
right now and it's kind of crazy how
much I love them I'm constantly
recommending them I wear them all
the time except for today when I don't
have lashes on and I apparently just
wanted to be a Barbie doll I don't I've
been really loving pink lately and if
you can't tell like today was the day
that I really wanted to show you how
much I loved the color pink but these
like I said are just my favorite lashes
there are $14 which i think is a pretty
darn fair price I can reuse them several
several times my favorite shades are
bombshell and diva and I have
repurchased them over and over I did
originally get these sent to me in PR
and that I've gone on to repurchase them
many times especially those two styles
because they are just my favorite you
can find them on the Pierre website and
then bombshell and diva are also
available on the alte website so I'll
help everything link down below of
course but I love these lashes and then
I just have a few more lip products to
finish off with so these are the NYX
soft matte lip creams these are going to
similar to me to the Maybelline ones
like when I started building up my
lipstick collection I purchased so many
of these NYX soft matte lip creams I
still really enjoyed them to this day
and I would highly recommend them I had
both London and also Abu Dhabi in my top
20 nude lipstick shades I love these
ivory purchased London several times and
ivory purchased Abu Dhabi at least once
and then two other shades that I've
purchased for myself is also Athens and
then San Paolo and also I know that I
purchased Milan for myself as well which
is a lighter pink get APR package from
NYX and it came with the entire line of
the soft matte lip creams and I got so
excited over that just knowing how many
I purchased myself and how much I loved
those soft matte lip creams to get the
entire line was a really really special
day for me I mean one that I don't think
that I'll ever forget cuz it was so cool
but those are the four shades that I
have currently that I've purchased
myself and like I said I also have
purchased Milan but I really enjoyed the
soft matte lip creams I think they are
fantastic and then the last items that I
have to chat about are the colour-pop
lipsticks I have purchased many many
many color pop lipsticks both the ultra
mattes and then when they came out the
ultra satin I started purchasing the
ultra satins as well some of the shades
that I have right now is Sunday which is
a really nice neutral pink I also have
the shade strip which I believe Candice
is sent
to me and then I have a point zero which
was the collaboration with
kathleenlights one of my favorite
cool-toned lipsticks and then I also
have a screenshot and instigator these
are both peachy shades I purchased them
when they came out with like a peach
collection and have a trail of lipsticks
in there I have had way more than what
is this five I've had way more than five
in my collection for color pop lipsticks
I've talked about it in past videos but
I don't feel like the ultra mattes hold
up very well I feel like the formula
goes bad after a short period of time
and the ultra statins hang on for a
little bit longer but again I have
problems where I have to declutter them
fairly frequently because the formula
just goes bad it changes colors it
doesn't look good on the lips as much
but they are only like six dollars I
believe for both of them so if you have
a smaller collection if you have a lip
color that when you love it you wear it
every single day until it's completely
gone
I would totally say get the colour-pop
ones at the $6 because they are a really
nice formula I just feel like I have to
declare to them quickly and so I have a
large ellipse at collection that's kind
of a bummer but yes the colour-pop ultra
bad and austere sentence I have
purchased to way more weigh more than
four of these so that is gonna do it
afford the four or more tech video I
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and sing some of the products that I
absolutely love and that I continue to
repurchase let me know in the comments
down below what do you have in your
collection that you have four or more of
that you just absolutely love and have
to have several shades in your
collection I would love to know again I
will have those other channels that link
down below
Lauren Lisa and Emily know well they
will all be down there in case you're
interested in checking out some other
channels or some other videos as similar
to this but as always if you guys did
enjoy this video I hope that you'll give
it a thumbs up I hope that you will also
consider subscribing before you go and I
will catch you guys in tomorrow's video
